After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I couldn’t attend Visitas as a pre-frosh. Instead, I came the weekend before and stayed with a friend. Thankfully, that weekend wasn’t just an average weekend: It was Yardfest weekend.
Let me set the scene.
At the ripe age of 17, I was feeling pretty good about myself. I was choosing between going to Harvard and UC Berkeley for college. I was a second-semester senior in high school, enjoying being king of the school with my classmates. And, to top it all off, I had just gotten my first kiss a few months beforehand—a huge accomplishment for the Star-Trek-obsessed, calculus-loving, acne-bacteria-test-site-faced, skinny-as-a-rail-from-a-factory-in-which-they-produce-especially-thin-rails me.
So I was excited. The concert would not only give me an impression of social life Harvard, but it would also be fun way to cap off my time in high school.
Turns out, it wasn’t really that at all.
Das Racist was the band headlining Yardfest. In case you haven’t heard of them—which is the case for everyone reading this article who isn’t as senior—they’re a duo known for their hit “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.” Here’s a taste of the lyrics:
“I’m at the Pizza Hut. What? I’m at the Taco Bell. What? I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.”
Predictably, they didn’t attract a big crowd at Yardfest. It probably didn’t help that they started their set with the statement: “What’s up, you drunk, overprivileged shits?” There were about two rows of people close to the stage dancing. The rest of the Yard was empty. People were pretty miserable. And they weren’t much happier when Tyga came the following year.
Of course, things have gotten better since those artists were invited. Janelle Monáe was great last year, and Jessie J will probably put on a good show.
But here’s the thing: Although there’s been an upward trend of artists over the years, we’ll never have the big headliners other schools have. Brown had Kendrick Lamar playing at its spring festival in 2013. University of California, San Diego, had headliners Diplo, Young the Giant, and Juicy J last year (yes, all of them at one event). And UPenn has tremendous artists every year.
People will recognize some of Jessie J’s songs, but few probably own her albums. At the end of the day, the CEB has a budget for Yardfest that’s smaller than those of other schools. We’re not a party school, and I don’t think we want to be one. So, especially if we’re going to keep the event free for students, there aren't be any huge names coming to campus anytime soon. Unless…
I did some research. And, as it turns out, there are a bunch of big and affordable names out there. It’s just that people haven’t said their names in a while.
Thanks to a list released by Degy, an entertainment booking company that specializes in booking artists for college events, we can see the approximate price ranges for booking various artists. Janelle Monáe is on the list in the $30k-$50k range. So let’s take that as a baseline budget for Yardfest.
Guess who else is listed in that price category: Cheap Trick, Foreigner, Slash, and T-Pain. The first two are 70s and 80s bands with huge mega-hits like “I Want to Know What Love is,” “Surrender,” and “I Want You to Want Me.” And the latter two are now solo artists with plenty of hits of their own.
I know it sounds strange. These artists are not in their prime and their songs are not as popular as they once were. But look deep inside of yourself and ask: What could be more fun and hilarious than bumping with your friends to T-Pain in the yard? What would be more fun and hilarious than going ham to some guitar solos from Slash up on the stage?
There’s another benefit to looking at older artists. Harvard uses its name to get big speakers to come to campus, often presenting them with lifetime achievement awards. Old bands like Journey still play stadiums. But if they got an award from Harvard and had speeches or discussion on campus, I bet they might be willing to play a show as well afterwards for a reduced fee. Think of it: Journey—JOURNEY—playing a show on our campus.
It all boils down to the fact that if we continue to aim for popular, new artists, we’ll never match up to the lineups at other schools. Instead of trying to compete with other spring festivals, we should make Yardfest a new concert genre unto its own.
We’re the oldest school in the country. Let’s have the oldest artists too. The first year may be weird. But after a few years the trend will catch on. Yardfest would take on its own identity. That identity would be quirky. It would be funny. It would be fun. And it’d become another great defining feature of this school.
Anyways, that’s the dream. It’s a long-shot. But, as a wise band once said, “Don’t Stop Believin'.” Let’s bring Journey to Yardfest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last December, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced the creation of the Mayor’s Office of Diversity, an initiative designed to ensure that the demographic composition of Boston’s city government more closely represents the people it serves. We believe that Walsh’s goal is a noble and important one: An office of diversity has real potential to reduce problems with race relations in Boston.
Walsh’s decision was motivated by a report detailing the underrepresentation of minorities in the municipal government. The task of remedying this disparity now falls upon Shaun Blugh and Freda Brasfield, who will serve as the chief and deputy chief diversity officer respectively. Blugh has had experience with working to increase diversity within large corporations, while Brasfield is a longtime city employee. In their new roles, Blugh and Brasfeld are aided by Walsh’s stated commitment to diversity; in the year since he took office, the composition of newly hired city employees so far closely mirrored the demographics of the city.
We hope that the new Office of Diversity will use this strong foundation to inspire its efforts throughout the city. Imposing a racial quota on city jobs is clearly and undoubtedly not the right way to create diversity; instead, this office will be at its most effective if it is able to go into communities with large minority populations and encourage qualified people there to apply for city jobs. A diverse applicant pool is a necessary part of the transition to a diverse workforce, and a major recruiting effort is necessary build up that applicant pool—this is the clearest path towards fixing the current imbalance. Data obtained by the Boston Globe shows that 61 percent of city employees are white compared with only 53 percent of Bostonians, and that white employees are paid 10 percent more than black employees and 14 percent more than Hispanics. An effective diversity office must act expeditiously to correct the imbalances.
There are some minor questions, raised by the Walsh administration, concerning the methodology of the previous administration in collecting the data. As part of their new roles, Blugh and Brasfeld must also develop more effective and accurate methods of measurement.
Finally, we believe that the biggest challenge for the diversity office is appropriately addressing the departments that are most frequently in direct contact with citizens. The need for change is evident—for example, 72 percent of fire department employees are white. Though the outreach necessary to expand the pool of firefighter candidates is naturally more difficult because hiring is exam-based and preference is given to veterans, this is a poor excuse. Especially in the aftermath of the tragic events in Ferguson, Mo., diversity in police and fire departments has been a frequently discussed topic. Cities like Ferguson would be well served to consider implementing similar offices to ensure that citizens are fairly represented in their local governments. While this is hardly the only way to prevent harmful interactions between city employees and the citizens they are tasked with serving, it is a critical place to start.

UPDATED: April 8, 2015, at 1:37 p.m.
If some (or, rather, many) were to have their way, they would amend the First Amendment to this: Your right to free speech ends where my feelings begin. As per usual, the proponents of the “feelings” standard would persist in leaving it undefined. After all, why bother with that antiquated requirement for precise definitions when, nowadays, the “progressive” West is (all too) experienced at predicting and prohibiting the kind of speech that, under the latest implicit standard of feelings, would be deemed beyond the pale?
By the West, I don’t mean the judicial and legislative branches of the governments of the United States and European countries; no longer is it trendy to settle on judicial and legislative experts to determine the bounds of liberties. Instead, the up-and-coming de facto judge, jury, and executioner are Muslim extremists—a three-in-one package deal—who, in effect, enforce the “feelings” standard with a bombing here, a beheading there, and fatwas everywhere. Western political puppets are, then, clued in to what that standard is, and tacitly comply by lending their authority to the prohibition of any speech not congratulatory of Islam. Meanwhile, they diligently remind their people that the barbarism has nothing to do with Islam.
It has been a busy year for Nothing-To-Do-with-Islam. Two Japanese hostages, two British aid workers, two American journalists, and, most recently, 21 Coptic Egyptians, are among many victims who either appeared to have been or were in fact beheaded by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Not to worry, though. Contrary to what one might intuit from the self-described Islamic group, the beheadings have nothing to do with Islam, according to Islam experts British Prime Minister David Cameron and United States President Barack Obama.
Cameron and Obama are also relentless champions of the disenfranchised. One would think, then, that they would have sympathy for a female, atheist, black, immigrant, feminist, as per the progressive Western tradition of the multiculturalist hierarchy.
Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who fits this description to a tee, seems to have been left out. Hirsi Ali, an outspoken critic of Islam and Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center, was born into a Muslim family in Somalia, and, as a young child, was subjected to female genital mutilation. To escape an arranged marriage, she fled to the Netherlands, where she was given asylum and then citizenship. After earning her MA in political science, she worked in the Dutch Parliament, where she campaigned to raise awareness of violence against women. She must have lost her female, atheist, black, immigrant, feminist appeal and outgrown the favor of the multiculturalist cabal after she associated honor killings and female genital mutilation with Islam.
Last year, Brandeis Univeresity rescinded an offer for an honorary degree from Hirsi Ali for her statements that Islam is not a religion of peace and tolerance. In her book “Infidel” she writes that “Westerners are the ones who misunderstand Islam. The Quran mandates these punishments. It gives a legitimate basis for abuse.” Hirsi Ali then asks “secular, non-Muslim people to stop kidding themselves that ‘Islam is peace and tolerance.’”
Whether one agrees with or is offended by Hirsi Ali’s reading of the Quran is not the issue. The issue is whether her (or, rather, the) right to free speech should be respected. According to Hirsi Ali, cultures can only advance through open and honest debate. She writes, “Because there is freedom of speech in the West, that debate is open.” Thus, Hirsi Ali argues that though all cultures are flawed, “Western flaws—the white man’s flaws—his sexism, his racism, his prejudices have been criticized, and radically changed. The white man is no longer as racist as he was 50 years ago or 100 years ago.”
Only through rigorous scrutiny can cultures progress, and only through free speech can rigorous scrutiny occur. The “progressives” of the West, however, do not seem to want to afford Islam the same opportunity of scrutiny and discussion through which their own cultural values matured.
Hirsi Ali laments, “We create taboos in Western societies, a subject is simply declared you can’t talk about it, you can’t discuss it except in a positive way. And Islam is one of those subjects today in the West.” Though Western societies do not intend disrespect (in fact, they sincerely believe they pay Islam the utmost respect), short-circuiting organic discussions of the Islamic culture implies that Islam is either unworthy of undergoing or incapable of surviving the test of scrutiny.
In effect, Islam remains marginalized in our “tolerant” and “inclusive” society. Systematic restriction of the marketplace of ideas aborts progress from the very extremist ideology and behavior that are at the source of discrimination and that the Western “progressives” preach have nothing to do with Islam.
Rather than shrouding Islam with implicit speech regulations like those Cameron and Obama advocate, why not debate it? Why not respect those who examine it, even—or, better yet, especially—those who are actually Muslim?
Rather than watching Muslim extremists bomb Islam back to a stage of infancy, where it is too feeble to stand the test of scrutiny, why not catapult it to the ranks of other discussion-worthy ideologies so that, one day, Muslim extremism will, indeed, have nothing to do with Islam?
Free speech is not the enemy of Islam and Islamophilia; it is their ally. It is the ally of Islam because it equips Islam with self-awareness. It is the ally of Islamophilia because it is the expression of genuine respect and the truest love for Islam.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
George Lipsitz, a sociology and black studies professor at University of California Santa Barbara, called for the reorientation of the academic humanities toward promoting social justice in a discussion Friday afternoon, delivered as part of a speakers series at Harvard’s Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History.
Lipsitz’s talk, titled “Inured to Suffering: Ferguson as a Failure of the Humanities,” follows a December event co-sponsored by the Warren Center that focused on hip hop activism in the aftermath of the Ferguson shooting.
Speaking to an audience of roughly 40 people, Lipsitz argued that the August 2014 shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., reflected a history of entrenched racism and socioeconomic inequalities that have been perpetuated by academic institutions.
He said students of the humanities should focus on identifying the systemic problems that cause individual tragedies and engage in meaningful dialogue with the communities they seek to understand. He also emphasized what he perceives as the need for universities to become more racially and socioeconomically inclusive, as well as more connected to the communities around them.
“We’re living in what I think is no ordinary time. There are times when there are crises of social and economic systems that create new cultures. It’s important for us to be part of our moment,” Lipsitz said.
In an interview before the talk, Walter Johnson, director of the Warren Center and a Harvard History professor, discussed the importance of the Ferguson shooting as a catalyst for dialogue.
“This is a moment for a fundamental reconsideration of a history of racial and economic discrimination. We can take those 90 seconds on Canfield Drive [the site of the Ferguson shooting] as a moment to consider the last 90 years of American history,” Johnson said.
John F. Bell, a member of the audience and a graduate student in American studies at Harvard, said before the event that he came to the talk because of his admiration for Lipsitz’s academic work and his interest in the topic.
“I think that the humanities have a lot to offer contemporary society and civic discourse, and it’s important that we make those connections, if only to remind people of our relevance,” he said.

University President Drew G. Faust said she strongly disapproved of activist group Divest Harvard’s occupation of Massachusetts Hall last month, arguing that the group does not “have the right to stop University business.”
“I thought that it was unfortunate they had turned to these coercive tactics, which were very upsetting to the woman at the desk who was trying to stop them from getting in, were very disruptive of our work in the building that day, and I think signaled a movement away from the principles of exchange and legitimate free expression that are part of this campus and are part of what we believe in,” Faust said in an interview Friday.
Last month, more than 30 Divest Harvard members and supporters occupied the first floor of Mass. Hall—home to Faust’s and other top administrators' offices—and a subset of about 14 stayed for roughly 24 hours. The group is also planning a week long protest, dubbed “Harvard Heat Week,” in mid-April that aims to draw alumni supporters to campus.
Divest Harvard has ideologically sparred with Faust because its members believe the University can have an influence on popular opinion against the fossil fuel industry and its influence on Capitol Hill by divesting its endowment from fossil fuel companies.
Faust, speaking to The Crimson for the first time since the occupation, has routinely maintained—in public statements, in emails with Harvard’s faculty group for divestment, and on her recent trip to China—that she believes the University can best address climate change through its research initiatives, rather than divestment.
“I wish [Divest Harvard] would focus on accomplishing what we want to accomplish, which is have an effect on climate change, rather than on one particular instrument, which they seem focused on almost to the point of forgetting about what the outcome for such an action would be,” Faust said.
Following repeated requests from Harvard’s faculty group for divestment for an open forum on Harvard’s investment in fossil fuels, Faust will convene a panel of experts to discuss climate change on April 13. Charlie Rose, a talk show host and journalist, will moderate the panel, which will feature several Harvard affiliates, including Harvard Faculty for Divestment member and History of Science professor Naomi Oreskes.
Faust said she considers the panel an open forum and is still working out the logistics of the meeting with Rose, but hopes audience members can ask panelists questions. She clarified that the panel is not structured to allow attendees to ask her questions.
Harvard Faculty for Divestment has asked in open letters for an “open forum in which members of the Corporation, students, faculty, and alumni speak.” James M. Recht, one of the principal authors of Harvard Faculty for Divestment’s open letters, said last week that he did not consider Faust’s panel an open forum.
When asked about the possibility of an open forum that would include her and members of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—and allow Harvard affiliates to ask her questions about divestment, Faust said she does not think such an event would be valuable.
“I don't see that as a very useful kind of structure,” Faust said. “And I think we have had plenty of interchange. The views of the Corporation and the president are clear. I've answered questions on this.”
University spokesperson Jeff Neal attended The Crimson's interview with Faust.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 30, 2015, at 2:33 p.m.
With a fifth-straight Ivy League title and yet another appearance at the NCAA March Madness tournament, Harvard's men’s basketball team just finished another season when they made more than three pointers—they are hitting the (literal) money shot.
The recent success of the basketball program since coach Tommy Amaker took the helm in 2007 has drawn crowds of students and alumni to games and generated enthusiasm about the team. This excitement has translated into excitement about the University in the middle of a $6.5 billion fundraising drive, which can potentially lead to donations, according to Harvard administrators.
University President Drew G. Faust, who said she attended several games at Lavietes Pavilion with her husband Charles E. Rosenberg this past season, said she has noticed alumni excitement surrounding the games.
“When I go to the basketball games, I certainly see alumni there. I’m not always sure whether they’re going to be donors or not—some of them have been, some of them will be,” Faust said. “I think [alumni] ties to the Harvard community are only enhanced by their participation in this wonderful event, which is watching these students try so hard and do so well.”
Harvard basketball volunteer and former player Fred Schernecker ’89 said he has seen a change in alumni and community engagement at the basketball games in the Amaker era—games that once struggled to draw attendees now sell out, Schernecker said. Because alumni convene at the games, he added that the Lavietes Pavilion has become a place for Harvard administrators to meet with alumni and donors.
“Because the alumni are congregating and engaging in basketball, that’s a nice venue for Harvard to get together with their alumni and with donors,” Schernecker said. “I think there have been nice opportunities for the University to capitalize on [that excitement] and improve their fundraising.”
In recent years, the men’s basketball team has attracted national headlines—from 2012’s “Linsanity” craze surrounding the success of former Harvard player Jeremy Lin ’10 on the New York Knicks to the Crimson’s upset of 5-seed Cincinnati in the second round of the 2014 NCAA tournament. These events can remind alumni of the University, said Friends of Harvard Basketball member Katherine B. Rollins ’09, which can then facilitate Harvard in scoring donations by capitalizing on this enthusiasm.
“Any time you can trigger fond memories and excitement and pride within alumni, that’s going to manifest in support of the University,” Rollins said. “If you graduated last year or 60 years ago, you can find enjoyment in [basketball].”
Alumni have also organized events surrounding the games—particularly for fans to watch them during the NCAA tournament. Mitchell L. Dong '75, a longtime University financial supporter who regularly attends the basketball games, said a contingent of affiliates attended the NCAA game in Jacksonville, Fla. In addition to holding a pre-game party and post-game that drew 100 to 200 people, the alumni, professors, and administrators also sat together to cheer on the Crimson, according to Dong.
Though they were knocked out in the second round of the NCAA playoffs in a “heartbreaking” defeat to University of North Carolina just two weeks ago, Schernecker said the success of the team will continue to draw alumni to the courts, possibly with checkbook in tow.
“People like to be involved, or associated with winners and with things that are doing well,” Schernecker said.

A conference focusing on interdisciplinary examination of justice in the food system drew hundreds to Harvard Law School’s Wasserstein Hall this weekend for “Just Food?,” a joint project between the Harvard Food law Society and Harvard’s Food Literacy Project.
Featuring guest speakers, workshops, panels, movie screenings, and exhibits, the conference solicited over 500 registrations.
Several notable guests spoke at the conference, including Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, who delivered a welcome address. Ricardo Salvador, director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, was originally scheduled to deliver a keynote talk on Sunday but was unable to attend, according to conference organizers.
In lieu of Salvador’s talk, organizers arranged for Olivier De Schutter, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, to speak via video. Schutter praised the conference as being “extremely timely and important” and spoke of what he perceives as a need for the United States to adopt a national food policy to reorganize the current food system.
Margiana R. Petersen-Rockney, the Food Literacy Project coordinator, and Alexandra M. Jordan, a second-year Law School student and president of the Harvard Food Law Society, organized the two-day conference under the Food Better campaign, an initiative launched by the Deans’ Food System Challenge “to raise awareness about food systems issues,” according to its website.
Petersen-Rockney and Jordan said they began planning the conference last fall semester with the hope of using Harvard’s notoriety and prestige to illuminate the current problems facing the food system in the U.S. and start a productive conversation about these issues.
Rather than having one definition of “food justice” control the conversation, Petersen-Rockney said she hopes that the conference will instead “empower[...]attendees to define food justice for themselves and engage their own communities and their own fields in contributing to a more just food system.”
Lynsey A. Miller, a sales director and part owner of the Equal Exchange Co-op, which exhibited its products at the conference, enjoyed being able to connect with others who share a “common ground around food, but have all started from really different perspectives or corners of the food system.”
Marcus K. Granderson ’18, a member of the FLP who assisted at the conference, highlighted the broad scope of issues surrounding food systems.
“I feel like in our society, we don’t think about food as being inclusive of so many issues humans face, whether it be human rights, if you consider gender, race, or sexuality…All those issues are within the food system, and this conference really highlights those issues and brings to light what we need to do as a society to fix those problems,” he said.

More than five months after establishing a “colony” of the international fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon at Harvard, students have raised about $25,000 to facilitate the pledge process and purchase property for the fraternity.
Alumni of other DKE chapters, as well as DKE international, have given the colony most of the funds raised so far, according to Jimmie Hill ’18, president of Harvard DKE. The group is looking to secure a house in the Cambridge or Allston area and is beginning its spring pledge process on Monday.
Continuing the growth of Greek life at the College, undergraduates formed a DKE  “colony” last semester, sororities drew record bid numbers this spring, and the College has seen the addition of three Greek organizations, including DKE, in as many years.
In the next month, DKE treasurer Samuel Z Liu ’18 said, the group plans to reach out directly to more alumni to solicit funds. The group ultimately hopes to secure around $700,000 for a property deposit, partly through donations and potentially assistance from the fraternity's headquarters, Hill said, adding that the group is also considering relying instead on a significant loan.
DKE has already contacted a realtor and a private brokerage firm and hopes to raise enough funds or secure a loan by August, he added. Last week, Hill said, he toured a house on Linden Street, which had eight bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms.
The group must eventually apply to become a fully recognized “chapter,” but in the meantime, undergraduate and graduate students are raising funds for property and preparing for their spring rush.
“[Our] two biggest priorities are recruitment and housing,” Hill said.
Since DKE’s formation, Hill said initiated members have met twice weekly with DKE alumni in the Boston area. Members have been soliciting financial assistance from alumni, who have offered lump sums or monthly donation plans with the goal of purchasing real estate.
Meanwhile, seven students—three undergraduates and four graduate students—will begin pledging the fraternity on Monday. DKE plans to initiate members in early May at MIT’s DKE fraternity house, Hill said.
The Office of Student Life does not officially recognize fraternities, meaning that fraternities may not, among other privileges, reserve space for events. Hill said he met with OSL affiliates earlier this semester to clarify space rules, but has not been in contact with administrators since then.
According to Hill, the College’s decision not to recognize Greek life at the College presents challenges, but has not halted the organization of DKE.
“At this point, the school hasn't recognized us, and we’ve done fine. It has been difficult, but it’s not impossible,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pajama parties are not a typical topic of discussion for the Dean of Harvard College. But earlier this month, when one of Harvard’s all-male final clubs circulated a party invitation that prompted a fury of criticism from women on campus, Rakesh Khurana reacted with a very public response.
In an email to all undergraduates, Khurana did not hide his distaste for the invitation, which advertised a Spee Club party and linked to a YouTube video featuring multiple clips of women wearing underwear. He characterized it as “offensive, crude, and sexist” and argued that it ran “counter to the values we hold as a community.”
Khurana’s email is just one example of how the College’s top administrator has engaged with unrecognized social clubs in his first few months on the job: more openly and more pointedly than administrators have in recent years, according to some students.
“The current administration has been more vocal than we’ve seen in the past,” said Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, who is a member of the all-female Bee Club.
“Previously, this relationship was probably a hush-hush topic,” added UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, who is a member of Harvard’s chapter of the Kappa Sigma fraternity.
Social clubs are no small part of the social scene at Harvard, which for decades has played host to all-male final clubs and now includes female equivalents and burgeoning Greek life. The trend is only growing as a new fraternity establishes its presence on campus and sororities draw more interest among students.
The College does not recognize these single-gender social groups. Still, although on paper the relationship between most social clubs and Harvard is officially estranged, administrators in practice maintain a relationship with these groups behind the scenes. They meet with club affiliates over meals and in clubhouses and offer to train their members in alcohol safety and sexual assault prevention. Administrators keep tabs on club leadership, but their refusal to recognize these groups leaves them with little control beyond that.
Khurana is taking on a new approach to dealing with these groups. He has publicly voiced skepticism of many social clubs’ single-gendered model and, some students and club affiliates say, complicated what is already a fragile relationship between unrecognized social organizations and the College. Khurana says he wants to encourage undergraduates to rethink the ways in which their social organizations may be exclusive, but some worry that the College's stance on final clubs and similar groups is at best futile and at worst counterproductive.
YEARS-OLD TIES
Social clubs at Harvard are far from new. With centuries-old histories at the College, they are embedded in its history—and are even chronicled in University archives. Harvard’s eight all-male final clubs have churned out famous writers, politicians, and even Harvard presidents themselves, whereas some of the younger female final clubs, sororities, and fraternities have secured real estate in Cambridge and are working to institutionalize their presence here. A few decades ago, the College may have recognized any one of these groups.
But in 1984, the University and its all-male final clubs officially cut ties. By this time, Harvard had been co-educational for more than a decade, and administrators increasingly worried about a social scene dominated by all-male groups. They gave the final clubs an ultimatum: Admit women, or lose the privileges that come with official recognition.
The final clubs chose to cut the cord, but the divorced institutions still maintained a relationship. Even after 1984, the administration still tried to exert some influence over the clubs. Archie C. Epps III, the College’s dean of students from 1971 to 1999, spoke with club graduate boards and their students members. Epps wrote an open letter to the College describing alleged happenings at the clubs, including public nudity and “lewd sexual acts” by hired women at a dinner. He also offered the clubs advice, which ranged from hiring bartenders to, in typical party line, electing female members.
More than three decades later, the College still does not recognize or maintain formal relationships with final clubs, nor fraternities and sororities, unlike other schools in the Ivy League such as Cornell and Dartmouth.
Student organizations that the Office of Student Life recognizes today enjoy many privileges. Unrecognized groups cannot publicize or poster for events on sandwich boards on campus, reserve campus rooms or space, or use College space for storage. They also may not send messages over House email lists, list their memberships in the yearbook, or apply for University funding, according to a memo that OSL administrators sent to presidents of final clubs, fraternities, sororities and other unrecognized social clubs last year that was shared with The Crimson.
It is unlikely that the College will ever recognize these groups, at least in their current form, according to administrators, who claim that their values do not align.
“They continue to be unrecognized because they don't adhere to our values as a College,”  Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said.
Khurana claims these unrecognized groups are exclusive. “The College continues to support the idea that…single-gendered organizations are not appropriate for the College,” Khurana said.
INFLUENCE BEHIND-THE-SCENES
But despite the official party line of non-recognition, administrators in recent years have engaged with final clubs and other unrecognized social groups in private, both through closed-door meetings and more informal conversations in an effort to exert some influence over their activities.
Every year, representatives from the OSL and other parts of Harvard’s administration—including Harvard University Police, the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response—meet with social club leaders and their graduate board affiliates, according to Lassonde. Typically, these meetings focus on rules surrounding hazing, drinking, and other University and state rules.
The meetings are not mandatory, but club members often choose to accept the invitation to keep up a relationship with administrators.
Besides these meetings, representatives from AODS and OSAPR regularly offer programming surrounding safe drinking and bystander intervention to final clubs. Last year, every male final club participated in bystander intervention training, according to Alicia Oeser, OSAPR’s director. Ryan M. Travia, the former director of the Department of Health Promotion and Education and AODS, said members of his office often visit social clubs and make presentations there.
More informally, administrators engage with club affiliates both on College property and on the clubs’ own. Shortly after becoming a House master, Khurana said a student invited him into an unrecognized social group’s building.
Travia, who left Harvard in March to take up a position at Babson College, added that he purposefully appointed social club members to become Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, which has helped him build relationships with clubs and understand them better.
“I've also been very strategic in our recruiting of the DAPAs. Forty percent of the DAPAs are varsity athletes,” Travia said. “Over 30 percent of the DAPAs are affiliated with a social club. That's not by mistake. That's by design.”
According to Lassonde, administrators work with club members because they realize that the clubs are a force on campus. “We don’t recognize you, but we do recognize that all of your members are students, and you do have a certain purpose in campus culture and you need to know what is going on,” Lassonde said.
“Whether you’re on campus or off campus, whether you’re recognized or unrecognized, our students have a responsibility as Harvard College students who represent and use the privileges of being a Harvard College student that you don't get to pick and choose, and selectively invoke that and not invoke that,” Khurana said.
ADMINISTRATIVE LIMITS
But lunches and occasional meetings between administrators and unrecognized social club members can only go so far. Because the College does not recognize these groups, administrators are limited in their ability to influence them, and some club affiliates say they are only so willing to engage.
John L. Powers ’70, the president of the all-male Fly Club’s graduate board, said administrators and club members agree on basic things like the need to curb at-risk drinking and create safe social spaces. But when it comes to talking about the existence of the clubs in general or their perceived exclusivity, he is less willing to engage administrators in that dialogue.
“What we do is I say, ‘I don't want to hear about “finals clubs” in general,’” Powers said, referring to the way that some non-club members incorrectly describe the clubs. “‘If you have an issue with the Fly or something that has happened there, let me know; let our steward know.’ That tends to work pretty well."
Reverend Douglas W. Sears '69, the president of the Fox Club’s graduate board and a former president of the Inter-Club Council before it disbanded, said the administration takes a hypocritical stance on final clubs. Harvard administrators fail to provide what he sees as an adequate alternative, Sears said, but then critiques them.
“Harvard's best and brightest, while decrying the existence of final clubs, in the last couple hundred years have not developed a system for undergraduate life that is as popular and as vibrant as the club scene,” Sears said. “[Final clubs] disproportionately take on the burdens of the socializing of Harvard students and also take on the burden of being criticized by Harvard for doing it. So it’s a rather hypocritical situation, but something Harvard seems very comfortable with.”
In general, Sears said he has always had professional relationships with administrators and thinks they share similar concerns around student health. But Sears said he takes issue with administrators’ argument that the clubs are exclusive when Harvard itself denies admission to the vast majority of its applicants.
When it comes to telling the clubs what to do, Powers said, the administration has little influence.
“They have no power to enforce us by their own decision,” said Powers, who is also a former Crimson sports editor. “They don't want responsibility for us, which I can understand. But it's also by the same token [that] they're not going to be able to tell us what to do."
Powers later added that he does not see the Fly becoming “inclusive” to the degree that administrators might hope.
To some, this lack of influence is a result of the nature of the official relationship between unrecognized social groups and the College. Jack C. Smith ’15, the former vice president of Harvard’s chapter of fraternity Sigma Chi, said the administration’s refusal to recognize some social clubs hinders its ability to regulate them.
"If you're not going to take those steps, and allow them to exist, but you're not going to be formally affiliated, you basically relinquish all control you have of these groups,” said Smith, who said his comments represent his own opinion, but not necessarily the fraternity’s.
Mitchell L. Dong ’75, a member of the Fly’s graduate board and a member of the Committee on University Resources, said administrators are in a difficult position where they want to control the clubs but realize they cannot.
“They don’t have control over [final clubs], just like they don’t have control over the restaurants and bars and clubs in Harvard Square,” Dong said. “But it’s not just a bar in Harvard Square; it’s a Harvard-related institution. So it kind of falls in their bailiwick and kind of doesn’t fall in their bailiwick. They can’t control it, yet it’s something they want to control, so I can see how it’s a thorn in their side.”
More than a dozen officers of fraternities, sororities, and female and male final clubs declined or did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
A NEW WAY FORWARD
Since becoming dean of the College last year, Khurana has entered the age-old administrative debate between the College and unrecognized social groups over their place on campus in something of an unconventional way. Last October, Khurana joined social club affiliates and other administrators at their regular meeting but changed its usual tone: He asked club affiliates probing questions about diversity and exclusivity, prompting mixed reactions from attendees. And in March, as students debated the Spee invitation, Khurana weighed in on the incident.
His message has been clear: Students in social clubs should consider how to make their organizations inclusive.
“I think he’s more vocal than deans past,” said UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16, who is not a member of an unrecognized social club.
Khurana, for his part, maintains that he is engaging with all students, and particularly student leaders, on the same issues of diversity and student inclusion.
Many undergraduates have lauded Khurana’s more public stance toward final clubs and other unrecognized social groups. But some worry that even this vocal approach may not be enough, and still others have criticized his response.
UC representative Happy Yang ’16 said the relationship between social clubs and the administration is often “obscure” and people do not always speak openly about it. She said she welcomed Khurana’s email in response to the Spee incident, but said she would like even more engagement from him on the topic, such as an open forum or statement clarifying his position on the groups.
Administrators “should exert greater pressure [on] these clubs,” Yang said.
Smith, who is a member of Harvard Men Against Rape, said he did not view the Spee’s recent party invitation or accompanying video, but praised Khurana for taking a stance on the matter. Still, he said that Khurana and undergraduates’ response amounted to a missed opportunity to engage further with a College-wide conversation on the issue.
Khurana’s response to the controversial party invitation and the College’s stance toward unrecognized social clubs, however, have also prompted criticism. Some students worry that Khurana has alienated members of unrecognized social groups in a way that could potentially hinder future negotiations.
"It's unfortunate that one of the repercussions of that sort of communication is that everyone associated with an unrecognized student group or a final club is suddenly painted with a broad brush as sexist, exclusive, unfriendly, unwelcoming," UC representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said.
Others take issue with the nature of the debate about the role of final clubs and similar groups. Sears said he has has not met Khurana before, but thinks he follows a long line of “pontificators” about the existence of final clubs.
Some fraternity members argue that the College’s active refusal to recognize these social organizations contradicts its goals. Smith argued that because fraternities, like other unrecognized organizations at the College, cannot use College-wide email lists to attract prospective members, they can seem more exclusive than they are.
"Not having that makes it kind of more hush-hush and exclusive at Harvard, and I don't like exclusivity—I'm not a fan of that," Smith said.
Kanuparthy suggests that the best approach to regulating unrecognized groups would be to recognize them. He is not alone: Jimmie Hill '18, the president of the recently formed Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity “colony” at Harvard, said he would “love” for the College to recognize DKE and disagreed with the suggestion that the fraternity is not consistent with the values of diversity at the College. According to Hill, any undergraduate male may go through the rush and pledge process, and the group hosts open events.
But for the time being, the status quo, and the fragile relationship between social clubs and Harvard that characterizes it, remain. Administrators do not intend to recognize these groups.
“We’re not going to be recognizing fraternities or sororities at Harvard College based on my understanding of where we are and where we’re going,” said Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, who oversees the College’s process of recognizing student groups. “We’re looking to the 21st century. We’re looking to encourage, again, our students to be thinking about how their experience plays out in the context of the mission that we have as the College. And that’s not a part of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council representatives heard from Cornell Student Assembly president-elect Juliana Batista and amended the UC Constitution at their general meeting on Sunday evening.
Batista, who was invited to speak to the Council during its allotted “Community Time,” spoke to the Council about collaboration amongst Ivy League schools and about Cornell Student Assembly accomplishments. Batista said that Cornell’s student government was able to provide town halls and other resources for the 49 percent of Cornell undergraduates who live off campus and gather general feedback with “upper-level” Cornell administrators.
Batista also expressed her frustration with parliamentary procedure and Robert’s Rules of Order, which the Student Assembly, like the UC, uses to structure their meetings.
The constitutional amendment, proposed by Winthrop House Representative and Crimson news writer Daniel R. Levine ’17, opted to clarify Robert's Rules regarding tabling legislation so that “motions to table docketed business may only occur during the period of debate” and “motions to table new business may only occur after its sponsor has presented the legislation for the prescribed one-minute time period.”
The amendment passed with three votes cast in opposition, one of them by Council Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16.
The clarification comes as Council members have complained about the UC’s use of parliamentary procedure, attributing the long length of its general meetings to the parliamentary rules.
The Council also voted to allot $10,500 to student groups looking to hold “large-venue events.” Organizers of the Identities fashion show and organizers of Ghungroo asked for $3,500 and $2,734, respectively, but only received $1,000 for each event. According to UC Finance Committee Chair Riya N. Patel ’17, the Council this year decided to allot no more than $1,000 to annually occurring events such as Identities and Ghungroo.
Also during the meeting, UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 said the Council’s student ID-CharlieCard pilot program will debut later this week, giving integrated cards to 100 undergraduates. The initiative was first discussed in an earlier general meeting on March 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday afternoon, snow flurries may have delayed the start of the Crimson Sevens women’s rugby tournament, but the wintry weather couldn’t keep the host team from lighting up the scoreboard beneath the bubble of Harvard Stadium.
The Crimson split its squad into two teams for Saturday’s action, as did visitors Norwich and Boston University. It was joined by one-entrant teams from St. Michael’s College and American International College. After playing three pool-play matches each to start the afternoon, competition concluded with a slew of inter-pool contests.
At the end of the day, the Crimson squad concluded with a 3-1 record, while its Black counterpart finished play with a 1-3 overall mark.
CRIMSON
For the Crimson side, emotions started to flow well before the starting whistle of the final contest of the day.
In a pre-match ceremony, Harvard’s graduating seniors were given loudspeaker recognition and bunches of roses, as fans around the sidelines greeted the moment with applause.
Once the championship contest against Norwich kicked off, however, the Crimson had to deal with emotions of a different sort.
Within minutes, Harvard had conceded a pair of tries to the Cadets, and by halftime, this deficit had grown into a full-scale blowout, with the Crimson entering the break down 26-0.
Rather than letting up, Norwich piled on 35 more points in the match, coming out of the inaugural Crimson Sevens event with a 66-7 victory and a tournament championship. The Cadets have also won the last four national championships in sevens rugby.
“We learned some new really interesting new moves on attack,” senior captain Kaleigh Henry said. “We can analyze the game film to see what they did to break down our defense, so we can really move forward from there.”
Down 31-0 in the second period, senior Cheta Emba provided the sole score for the Crimson. After collecting the ball, she streaked down the right sideline, leaving the Cadets in her wake to get Harvard on the board.
In order to reach the final match, the Crimson had to earn a first-place finish in its group. The deciding game proved to be the last one, as Harvard earned a 7-7 tie against AIC, the other squad vying for supremacy in the group. The Crimson advanced to the championship on a point-differential tiebreaker.
Before that, Harvard had come charging out of the gates, handing both BU (2) and Norwich (2) 41-0 losses.
“In order to be the best you have to play the best,” Henry said. “We really want to get out there and experience some really tough play.”
BLACK
After falling in each of its three matches of pool play, the Black contingent, which was largely comprised of athletes who had joined the sport in the last few months, picked up a hard-fought win in the seventh-place matchup against BU’s second team.
In that match, Harvard started hot when senior Ashley Ifeadike broke away from the Terrier defense, sprinting down the left sideline for a try that drew first blood and put the Crimson on top, 5-0.
Despite a later score from BU, this lead held. Sophomore Mariah Turner broke a tackle for a score early in the second half, and then, in the final moments of play, freshman Tessa Mussa blazed down the length of the field to seal the 22-5 win and the seventh-place finish.
But the day’s ending bore little resemblance to the day’s beginning, when the Black team opened play with a 40-7 loss to Norwich (1). This defeat was followed by 24-14 and 22-0 defeats at the hands of BU (1) and St. Michael’s, respectively.
Consequently, Harvard ended pool play as a fourth seed, which set it up for a bout with BU (2).
“When we consider this was their first sevens tournament, I have nothing but praise for their efforts and their improvement,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team wrapped up its nonconference schedule with a 4-3 victory over Boston University on Saturday afternoon at the Murr Center. The win over the Terriers (7-6 overall, 1-0 Patriot League) allowed the No. 48 Crimson (7-5) to finish above .500 in nonconference play for the fourth consecutive season.
It was also Harvard’s seventh consecutive victory over BU, dating back to the 2008 season. The team opens its seven-match Ivy League slate next weekend with road matches against Cornell and Columbia.
“It was nice to see the team compete super hard the weekend before Ivies,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “It was a good confidence builder for us, and it was great to win the doubles point.”
The Crimson was able to capture the first four matches of the day, including the doubles point, to pick up the victory early, while the Terriers took the last three. It was the team’s second consecutive victory and third in its last four matches.
Freshman Nikki Kallenberg led the way for Harvard from the first singles position. The Naples, Fla., native picked up her fifth consecutive victory after defeating BU junior Johanna Hyoty, 6-1, 6-2. The first-year improved her record to 18-4 on the season.
Fellow freshman Annika Ringblom and junior Amanda Lin also won their matches in straight sets. Ringblom, coming off an injury, picked up her first victory since February 8. The freshman bested Terriers sophomore Barbara Rodriguez, 6-1, 6-4.
“This was my first match back where I felt really good,” Ringblom said. “I thought we trained really hard this week as a team and I think when we went out there, our first few games showed that and we had really good team energy. I think we all played really good games and even the people who lost...still fought to the end and played really well.”
The most dominant performance of the day, however, came from Lin. The junior rode the momentum from victories in her last two matches to defeat BU junior Madison Craft without conceding a set. Her record on the season improved to 14-9.
While Hyoty and Rodriguez were able to defeat Lin and Ringblom in first doubles match, the Crimson was able to storm back in the second and third matches to pick up the doubles point. The freshman duo of Kallenberg and Ellen Jang-Milsten ousted Davis and Craft, 6-1. Lin and sophomore June Lee pulled out a 6-4 win over Kim McCallum and Iryna Kostirko.
With the outcome of the match already determined, the remaining three Harvard players continued to compete against the Terriers, but all three eventually fell short. BU junior Lauren Davis snapped sophomore Monica Lin’s three-match win streak with a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory from the second singles spot.
Despite the victory after just four matches, the Crimson was keen on supporting one another throughout all the matches, a characteristic that has been with the team all season and has led to its success.
“The team has definitely taught me how to compete better as a team player and really learned how to be supportive of everyone else,” Ringblom said. “The team has really taught me how to compete for the team and play for Harvard. They push me everyday at practice and I’ve definitely improved as a player since I’ve been here.”
Kostirko defeated Jang-Milsten in a match that went down to the wire. Kostirko took the first set, 6-1, and Jang-Milsten took the second, 6-4, before falling in a third set tiebreaker. McCallum also went to 2-0 on the day after besting captain Sylvia Li, 6-3, 7-5.
Green went with a different lineup on Saturday, resting some players and playing others in different spots.
“It was good to see some folks who don’t play as much or as high play a little bit higher today,” Green said. “We had a couple players out of the lineup just resting them for Ivies and it was good to get [others] a little more experience and get them match-tough for Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­SOUTH BEND, Ind.—Saturday night’s Midwest regional semifinal matchup between the Harvard and Nebraska-Omaha men’s ice hockey teams proved to be a game of inches, a game of seconds—one that brought the Crimson’s season to a close by the slimmest of margins.
Harvard (21-13-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) dug itself a hole early, falling a goal behind less than two minutes in. Unsure about the whereabouts of the puck after making an initial stop on rookie forward Avery Peterson, fourth-year goaltender Steve Michalek decided to hold his ground and take a faceoff.
But the puck was inches away.
Seeing the puck lying against Michalek’s right blocker, rookie forward Grant Gallo crashed the crease. The freshman wrestled the puck away from Michalek and a sprawled out Desmond Bergin and forced it home in the midst of a scrum to give his side an early edge.
At the end of the period, the Crimson fell into trouble yet again, as junior defenseman Brayden Jaw and fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell were sent to the box 25 seconds apart for tripping and boarding, respectively. Down two men, however, Harvard stepped up to the task, creating a shot of its own—a Max Everson attempt from the slot—before the Mavericks (19-12-6, 12-8-4-3 NCHC) did, holding its own for nearly the entirety of the period’s final 90 seconds.
But the buzzer was seconds away.
Omaha’s first shot on the 5-on-3 would be the only one that mattered, as Peterson took a pass from rookie forward Jake Randolph near the left faceoff circle and elevated one top shelf past the glove of Michalek with 1.4 ticks remaining. The goal put the Crimson down two goals at an intermission for the first time all postseason.
“It was pretty frustrating heading into the locker room, obviously,” co-captain Everson said. “It’s not ever the ending of a period you want. You want those shifts to be strong, but I thought [Peterson] made a nice play.”
OFF THE IRON
After coming out of the gate a bit sluggish and surrendering the first goal, Harvard upped the tempo in the latter half of the frame. But with senior goaltender Ryan Massa, who ranks third in the nation in save percentage (.936), in net for the Mavericks, the Crimson could not connect for an equalizer.
Nonetheless, Harvard came close. In accordance with the theme of the period, the Crimson came inches from leveling the score on its first power play of the night midway through the first when fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally’s blast from the point rang left iron. On the same man advantage, McNally nearly earned a helper after spotting junior forward Jimmy Vesey darting towards the right post. But Vesey’s shot sailed high, as Omaha finished the kill unscathed.
NUMBER 19
After Peterson doubled the Mavericks’ lead, the Crimson responded with just six shots in the second period. Harvard’s best opportunity, however, was one that did not produce a shot. But once again, inches separated the Crimson from getting the result it desired.
Finding a seam through the center of the ice, Vesey received a saucer pass out of the Harvard zone and launched his attack towards the net as he has done time and time again. But Vesey’s skate just beat the puck over the blue line, negating the junior’s breakaway opportunity.
Vesey would get another chance 3:09 into the third. After corralling a rebound off an Alex Kerfoot shot, Bergin moved from the goal line to the outside of the right faceoff circle, where he threw a difficult-angle shot on target. Massa made the stop, but the puck kicked out to Vesey on the opposite side of the crease, and the junior got the netminder to bite. As Massa began his dive, Vesey lifted a shot through the senior’s arms to give the Crimson life.
“If there is one guy that I don’t want that puck to land on his stick, it’s [Vesey],” Massa said. “That kid is quite a player. I don’t think we’ve played a guy yet this year that can control the game like he did.”
ZOMBO RETURNS
The goal was the 32nd of the season for the Nashville Predators prospect, who nearly produced an equalizer from Massa’s left post in the final stages of the contest. Enabling Vesey to get the opportunity was Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, who elected to give his top line extra shifts on the ice throughout the third as the Crimson pressed for a second goal.
While both fourth lines saw their minutes decrease as a result, Omaha’s fourth trio of forwards, led by co-captain Dominic Zombo, continued to provide a boost for the Mavericks’ squad.
After battling through an injury for much of the season, Zombo decided he had had enough back in January, leaving the ice during a battle with then-No. 1/1 North Dakota. The senior missed the next 10 games, a stretch in which Omaha won just two games in regulation. But Zombo made his return on Saturday, igniting the Mavericks’ squad alongside alternate captain James Polk on the fourth line.
“It really killed [Zombo] having to sit and watch practice and those games and that stretch where we kind of struggled on the tail end of the regular season,” Massa said. “He may not have been on our starting line, but he did his job, and led the team, and kept the youth focused and dialed in for the full game.”
While the senior provided the spark for Omaha, the youth earned the results. Eight different players recorded points for the Mavericks, all of which were either freshmen or sophomores. Rookie top-liner Jake Randolph picked up two assists, one on Peterson’s game-winner and another on freshman Tyler Vesel’s empty-netter at 19:24 in the third. The Mavericks’ top point-getter, sophomore Jake Guentzel, got in on the action as well, capping the scoring on his team's 4-1 win with a second empty-netter at 19:56.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 30, 2015, at 1:33 p.m.
As it enters the outdoor portion of the spring season, the Harvard track and field team competed in three different meets over the weekend. Led by senior Danielle Barbian, who set two conference records at the Texas relays, the squad had solid performances at all three meets.
TEXAS RELAYS
Barbian set the tone for the weekend Friday when, as the only collegiate athlete invited to compete in the 100-meter dash, she placed fourth with a time of 11.46 seconds. It was the fifth-fastest time in the nation this season. Autumne Franklin finished third in the 400-meter hurdles, the only runner in the top five who was not from an SEC or ACC school.
“In the final, [Franklin] ran average for the first half of the race and well in the second half,” said associate head coach Kebba Tolbert. “We saw flashes of what could be.”
In the heptathlon, junior Madison Hansen continued the team’s assault on the record books, setting a personal best with a score of 5210 that ranked second in school history. Junior Autumne Franklin finished third in the 400-meter hurdles, the only runner in the top five who was not from an SEC or ACC school.
“It is a talented group, and they really work hard,” Tolbert said. “At nationals performances, we have to be at the very top” of their game.
Tolbert reinforced that while the team is not at the level they hope to be, they have made good progress since the beginning of the season. The coach noted that the team will debrief following the victory but that it is on track for the same goals that it made at the beginning of the season.
“We are not close to where we need to be in May and June, but we are in a good place for March,” Tolbert said.
RALEIGH RELAYS
In Raleigh, the team did well in the longer-distance races. Senior Whitney Thornburg finished the 5000 meter race in 16 minutes, 34.61 seconds—good for 10th-best in Harvard history. Her teammate, freshman Courtney Smith, was close behind.
In the men’s race, senior Dan Milechman broke a personal best by nine seconds, finishing in just over 14 minutes. He was beat out by teammate junior Tom Purnell, who nabbed a seventh-place finish.
“I was very pleased [with the results] overall,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “The spring season take a bit more of a different feel.”
TUFTS SNOWFLAKE CLASSIC
The younger half of the team’s long-distance contingent stayed closer to home, competing in the Tufts Snowflake Classic in Medford, Mass. on Saturday. The team was led by freshman Elianna Shwayder. The Ann Arbor, Mich. native finished the 3000 meter race by nearly half a minute faster than her next-closest competitor, or roughly five percent of her overall time.
The dominance in the event continued on the men’s side, as freshman Tyler Spear finished in just under nine minutes to claim the title. In shorter distance events, freshman Ben Huffman finished second on the men’s side while the women had a troika of top-10 finishes between freshmen Annika Gompers, Sarah Angell, and Lizzy Thomas.
“I think the schedule has really allowed us to catch our breath and the team is fired up and excited for the outdoor season,” Saretsky said. “We certainly have a lot of work to do to get to where we want to be overall but still the transition to outdoors has gone relatively smoothly.”
Saretsky further noted that the team has enjoyed a run of good health at the right time of the year, with the squad almost complete as it heads to the stretch run.
“I feel now the team is at a good spot,” Saretsky said. “We have great medical people behind us and keeping us in one piece.”

CORRECTIONS: March 30, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that senior Danielle Barbian's finish in the 100-meter dash was an Ivy League record. In fact, it is not a record time. An earlier version of this article also miscontextualized a quote from coach Kebba Tolbert. In fact, he was referring to Autumne Franklin's finish in the 400-meter hurdles, not Barbian. Finally, an earlier version of this article misquoted Tolbert as saying that his team "expects to be at the very top" at nationals. In fact, he said they "have" to be at the very top.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team returned home this weekend to wrap up nonconference play before kicking off its Ivy League schedule next week against Cornell and Columbia.
The No. 33 Crimson (14-5) defeated Buffalo (8-7), 6-1, early Saturday morning, and followed up with a 7-0 sweep of defending NCAA Division III national champion Amherst (9-4).
“Against teams like this it is easy to come out expecting the other team to bow down to you, but we did a great job today of hitting them hard at the beginning with our energy,” junior Nicky Hu said. “We battled hard and took nothing for granted.  We are a good team that has yet to play our best, so I'm excited to see how we do in the matches ahead.”
HARVARD 7, AMHERST 0
Despite a new-look lineup, exclusively featuring all underclassmen at the singles spots, Harvard had little trouble upending the visiting Jeffs, who faced their first and only Division I opponent of the 2014-2015 season.
Sophomore Brian Yeung, who competed at the first singles spot, was the only player for the Crimson to take his match to a third set. Yeung blazed through the first set, earning the set by a score of 6-1. Amherst’s Andrew Yaraghi matched the sophomore’s first set effort by taking the second by the same score.
The sophomore, who was visibly frustrated with his second set performance, stormed back for the Crimson to win the night’s closest match, taking the third set, 13-11.
“We didn’t know what to expect coming in against Amherst,” Yeung said. “All of my teammates did well in closing out their opponents in the second set. We did well in keeping a high intensity and positive mindset.”
Freshman Kenny Tao handled Amherst’s Michael Solimano in straight sets at second singles. The win capped off a seamless day for the freshman, who was victorious in the first doubles match alongside Yeung, 6-1.
Sophomore Andrew Ball only gave up one game en route to his straight-set victory at fifth singles. All four freshmen on the team’s roster won their singles matches in straight sets, including victories from Grant Solomon, Jean Thirouin, and Xavier Gonzales, at third, fourth, and sixth singles, respectively.
The doubles team of senior Shaun Chaudhuri and Ball were victorious at second doubles, by a score of 6-4. Third doubles saw junior Conor Haughey alongside Thirouin defeat Amherst’s Jon Cypers and Russell Einbender by the same score.
“[Amherst is] one of the best Division III teams in the country,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said.  “You get a chance to see your whole squad in action. That was really good because the guys who don’t get to start as much work just as hard as the guys who do start.”
HARVARD 6, BUFFALO 1
Co-captain Denis Nguyen led the Crimson against the visiting Bulls, capturing the first singles victory in straight sets as well as the first doubles match alongside Yeung. Nguyen claimed the first set in the singles match, 6-4, and had less trouble in the second set, closing out Buffalo’s Damien David, 6-1.
Fellow co-captain Alex Steinroeder was the only Crimson player to need three sets to earn a victory, defeating Buffalo’s Jonathan Hannestad at fourth singles. A combination of experience and youth proved successful in the third doubles match, as Steinroeder paired up with Tao to earn a 6-3 win, helping to pick up the doubles point for Harvard.
Junior Nicky Hu, Chaudhuri, and Solomon earned straight set victories in third, fifth, and sixth singles, respectively. The lone loss for the Crimson came at second singles, as sophomore Sebastian Beltrame could not overcome Buffalo’s Pablo Alvarez, dropping straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.
“It never hurts to have a match that you execute well in,” Fish said. “The guys all deserve a pat on the back, but we cannot be satisfied, especially with the Ivies ahead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The men’s swimming and diving team’s season came to an end this weekend as two final competitors participated in the NCAA Championships in Iowa.
Senior diver Mike Mosca and sophomore swimmer Jack Manchester represented the Crimson in the national event. Both competed in two events over the four days of competition. It was Mosca’s third trip to NCAAs, while it was Manchester’s first chance on the national stage.
Mosca competed in the 1-meter and 3-meter dives in the meet, finishing in 38th and 37th places, respectively. He finished with a score of 301.70 in the 1-meter preliminary dives and 334.95 in the 3-meter. He was unable to move on to the finals in either of the events.
Mosca qualified for NCAAs earlier this month when he competed at the NCAA Zone A Diving Championships in Buffalo, NY. At the Zone A Championships, Mosca took first in the 3-meter dive and fourth in the 1-meter. This competition came shortly after Mosca swept the boards at the Ivy League Championships
In his first trip to NCAAs, Manchester competed in the 100 and 200-yard backstroke races.
The sophomore had his highest best finish of the weekend in the 200 backstroke, with a time of 1 minute, 41.64 seconds. This was just .2 seconds slower than his qualifying time of 1:41.44 which punched his ticket to NCAAs at the Ivy League Championships in February. With his time, Manchester added his name to the record books for the Ivy League Championship, Ivy League, and pool record in the 200 back.
Despite finishing lower in 38th place in the 100 back, Manchester had a personal best in the event with a time of 47.44 seconds. This was .17 seconds faster than his qualifying time and previous best of 47.61.
While Manchester has two more seasons to compete for the Crimson, Mosca finished his Harvard career Saturday. The Rhodes scholar graduates as one of the most decorated divers in Ivy League history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a big start to the second half, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (3-4, 1-1 Ivy) dropped a game to a visiting Stanford squad (5-1) on Friday night.
After a slow first half ending with a score of 5-5, the Crimson women came out strong with four goals within the first ten minutes of the second half to go up two goals. But despite the early second half Harvard surge, the Cardinals locked the game down in the last fifteen minutes of the half, going on an 8-1 run en route to a 15-10 win over the home team.
The first half of the match began slowly for the Crimson, with the offense only scoring two goals, resulting in a 5-2 Cardinal lead with six minutes left before the break. The team struggled to hold onto the ball early on, with Stanford holding possession for most of the first half. Harvard rallied, however, with a big goal from freshman midfielder Julia Glynn off the quick assist from sophomore attack Marisa Romeo to put the Crimson on the board for the first time in over 17 minutes.
“Shots were falling at the end of the first half, and a lot of them were catch shots,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “They were opening up…we were pressuring, and the middle opened up. That’s what were looking for.”
The Crimson would struggle with penalties, matching the Cardinals with one apiece in the first half, but tallying three in the second. The team would also total 36 fouls to Stanford’s 28.
The team closed off the half with goals from junior co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd and sophomore midfielder Maeve McMahon in the last three minutes to enter the second half tied at five.
“I thought we started off kind of slow, and even though we didn’t have possession of the ball that often, we managed to finish our shots towards the end of the half, which was something we were struggling with at the beginning,” Todd said.
The Crimson saw a big night from Romeo, who scored three and assisted on another three. Junior co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis tallied nine saves to keep the game close for the majority of the clock.
Despite going down early and struggling to keep possession of the ball, the Crimson capitalized off most of Stanford’s turnovers in the first half. The team struggled, however, when it came to draw controls. The team only secured 5-of-12 draws in the first half and 6-of-15 in the second. Harvard executed 11-of-15 clears and totaled 11 turnovers over the contest.
“[Stanford played] fast, and we’re a little thin through the midfield,” Miller said. “So we can go really hard for about 45 minutes and then you can see we were losing our legs on the draw control, we lose our legs defensively, and then we get a little panicky at the other side.”
Harvard would come out shooting in the second half, with McMahon and Glynn either assisting or scoring four of the Crimsons five goals. The team would rally for four goals within the first 10 minutes of the half but would be limited to only one in the last 20 minutes.
After going up 12-10 in the second half, the Crimson struggled to recover following two penalties against Harvard within 20 seconds of each other. Two players down, Stanford capitalized off the opportunity with three goals over the penalty period and another three after that to close out the game.
“I think we just had a couple of bad turnovers at a crucial time, and then [Stanford] capitalized on that,” Todd said. “After that, we were really struggling to get the draw control, so we didn’t have possession enough to get the goals back and get back in the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The plane ride may have been smooth, but the playing was smoother.
After enjoying the uncharacteristic luxury of air travel en route to an EIVA matchup against George Mason (8-10, 3-3 EIVA) in Washington, DC, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (10-8, 4-2) dominated from the moment that it stepped on the tarmac. By holding the Patriots to a .047 hitting efficiency, the Crimson earned a 3-1 victory and kept pace with second-place Princeton.
“Shorter travel helps us out a lot, whether it’s physically with rest or mentally just not being cooped up on a bus for a long time,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said. “That helped us to come out and play well from the beginning.”
The most extended sequence of weakness for Harvard came at the end of the second set, when the Crimson gave up a 6-0 run that transformed a 20-16 advantage into a 22-20 deficit. Despite staving off three set points, Harvard dropped the frame, 26-24.
But the Crimson responded right away in the next frame, using a 9-5 start to create separation. Again the set came down to a late run, but this time it was Harvard that pulled together in the end, cruising to a 25-18 win on the wake of an 8-1 stretch.
Then, and throughout the afternoon, defense was key to the Crimson’s success. Over the last nine points of the frame, Zimmick and junior outside hitter Branden Clemens each tallied a block.
“Our defensive played really well tonight,” Clemens said. “Midway through the third set, there was [that] blocking run, and that helped us get going.”
On the afternoon, Harvard earned 14 rejections. Zimmick, who leads the team with 77 total blocks, racked up three assisted and three unassisted ones.
“He’s very quick and a hard worker,” Clemens said. “Being 6’9” doesn’t hurt either.”
The defense proved stifling in the deciding set, when the Crimson held George Mason to a perfect .000 kill percentage. By contrast, Harvard recorded a game-high .524 mark in the frame.
The statistical discrepancy accurately described the imbalance of play. After winning the first two points, the Crimson never faced a deficit and won six of the last seven to end the set with a 25-15 victory.
We probably played one of our more complete matches of the season,” Zimmick said. “Our defense was really what carried us tonight. It was great to see that.”
As a complement to the defense, Clemens put up seven finishes in the frame. He scored 17 kills on the afternoon, more than any other player on the court.
Both captains also finished with double-digit finish totals. Zimmick notched 12 while senior outside hitter D.J. White added 10.
Harvard needed every part of this three-pronged attack to ward off the Patriots in the first set. George Mason, which entered the contest tied with the Crimson in the EIVA standings, never fell behind by more than four.
Instead, the frame developed into a back-and-forth battle, with each side holding the lead at least twice. With the score knotted at 23-all, however, the visitors pulled out a duo of points. Zimmick got a kill, the Patriots made an error, and Harvard took the set, 25-23.
Throughout the matchup, which was the first EIVA contest since the Crimson returned from a spring break trip to California, Harvard trotted out a new-look lineup that shifted players all over the court.
Perhaps most noticeably, sophomore Casey White donned the libero jersey, something he had done in several previous games. And for the third consecutive contest, White notched more than 10 digs, finishing with 11.
In addition, freshman Marko Kostich replaced sophomore Nick Bendell at the setter position. Kostich recorded 40 assists to go along with three kills and six digs.
“We hadn’t seen [George Mason] this year, so we were looking forward to the competition,” Zimmick said. “It’s big for us to get this win so we have confidence going forward knowing that we can play like we did today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A bit of bad weather was not enough to get in the way of the start of the Ivy League softball season for the Harvard softball team. After Saturday’s games were moved to Sunday due to unplayable conditions, the team wrapped up its first conference weekend 1-3, travelling to Columbia and Penn.
Up until this point in the season, the team has been preparing for conference play by facing competition in warm weather areas in order to gain experience playing together.
PENN 15, HARVARD 14 (8 INNINGS)
In the longest game yet this season, the Crimson (8-15, 1-3 Ivy) fought hard with the Quakers (11-9, 3-1) for eight innings, ultimately being outscored by Penn, 15-14. Harvard saw its 14 runs come from the bats of eight different players, with seniors Andrea Del Conte and Adrienne Hume each leading the team with three RBIs.
Though the Quakers were on the board early with a three run home run in the bottom of the first inning, the Crimson offense was not intimidated, as it answered with four runs in the top of the second. Two more were added in the third, extending Harvard’s lead to 6-3.
The lead built up to six runs with the Crimson adding four more in the top of the fifth inning, but this time Penn had a strong answer. After sending 12 players to the plate, the dust cleared and the Quakers had not only made up the deficit, but pulled ahead to lead 11-10.
Both teams went back and forth in the last two innings, going into the eighth tied at 14. After Harvard was unable to score in the top of the frame, Penn muscled across a run across to seal its victory.
PENN 10, HARVARD 4
The Crimson was unable to come back from a 4-0 deficit set in the first inning, ultimately falling in the opening game of Sunday’s play.
Harvard was not going down without a fight after going down in the first, as a second inning home run by Hume put two runs on the board. A glimmer of hope manifested in the third inning after an error and a stolen base put Del Conte in scoring position and senior infielder Katherine Lantz ripped a single to center that scored Del Conte, closing the gap to one run.
Penn was in control of the offense from then on, scoring another five runs in the fourth and one in the fifth.
“The way that the Ivy League is this year it’s going to be a really tight race to the championship and after this weekend’s games I think everyone is pretty close and we all know that and we know it’s going to be a fight to the end so all these games are meaningful,” Lantz said.
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 0
The first half of the second match up between the two teams was a pitchers duel, with neither team crossing home plate in the first three innings. Columbia (4-15, 1-3) was the first to break the trend in the bottom of the fourth, after a leadoff walk and a hit by a pitch put two Lions on base with no outs. A ground out that advanced the runners allowed Tonia Wu’s fly out to left field to turn into a sacrifice and a Columbia run.
The Lions tacked on two more runs in the bottom of the fifth and sixth innings, with no answer coming from the Harvard bats.
Junior pitcher Morgan Groom took the loss, going four innings with six strikeouts and two earned runs.
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 2
The Crimson’s only win of the weekend came in the opening game of the road trip.
Riding the arm of senior pitcher Laura Ricciardone, who went all seven innings and struck out five, Harvard was able to come from behind and take the opening game of the double header.
Columbia scored first in the bottom of the first, as leadoff hitter Alix Cook reached on a bunt single and came home on a double by Kerry Cook.
It was not until the fifth inning that the Crimson broke its silence when sophomore infielder Giana Panariello homered for the first time in her career. Panariello had all three RBIs for Harvard, with her sixth inning double providing the second and third run of the game for the Crimson.
“This weekend’s games were a little bit tough but I feel like we’re working through some things and we finally got our offense back so now it’s about fixing the other things that put our game together,” freshman infielder Melissa Lacro said.

It’s 2 a.m. in Lamont Cafe. You try to concentrate on your friend’s explanation about why she thinks it’s okay to be attracted to her history TF, but you just can’t help letting your eyes hover over to that cute girl sitting on those signature Lamont-brown couches (I personally have a theory that those couches were meant to be another color), gracefully reading Jane Eyre.
You want to approach her, but of course you don’t. You are a freshman; Lamont is most definitely not the place to hit on other people, and you also smell like a lamonster. Don’t you wish you could tell her that you’re madly in love with her without any negative repercussions?
Luckily, Yik Yak, a social media app which effectively functions as an anonymous Twitter for people who are close in proximity to you, is here.
Now, you can tell that girl in Lamont that you are ready to settle down and start a family!
What do I think of Yik Yak? The application is pretty cool. There are some funny jokes and confessions on there that most people normally wouldn’t admit to. For example:
“Yale is staleeeee.”  - Anonymous
“Broke up with gf, but at least I still have her HBO login! #gameofthrones”  - Anonymous
“Pancakes are just vegan steaks” - Anonymous
However, there is definitely a dark side to Yik Yak, which has proven to be a potential avenue for anonymous cyberbullying.
There are also a good amount of creepy people on there, but you probably imagined that already. A visit to Yik Yak never lacks sexually frustrated college kids asking others if they are “DTF” (Dancing Towards Faust?) or “have any kush,” whatever that means.
Therefore, as the moral role models that the wonderful people at Flyby are, we recommend you stay off of this application. People definitely don’t need to waste their time reading inane comments. If you ever find yourself appreciating someone in Lamont again, just talk to them. It’s much less creepy than posting about them on social media.
