After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The life of a struggling artist is often romanticized via big-picture questions, the kind that keep a person up at night. Why am I here? What do I want to say? Who will appreciate my art? “[title of show],” a musical comedy that ran at the Adams Pool Theater from Feb. 13-15, centered around those self-referential, artistic questions.
Protagonists Jeff (Christian J. Potterton of Berklee College of Music) and Hunter (Jacob D. Rienstra ’17) are writers looking to make their mark on Broadway, and they want the audience to know it. In fact, the entire show is semi-autobiographical, based on the aspirations of Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell, “[title of show]” composer/lyricist and book writer, respectively, and their real-life efforts to write an original musical for submission to an upcoming theater festival. Along with friends Heidi (Brooke E. Sweeney ’17) and Susan (Taylor Kay Phillips ’15), whom Jeff and Hunter (the characters) cast in their musical about writing a show, the duo mused, sang, and danced about writer’s block, type casting, naysayers, fundraising, and the ultimate goals of their production. “We could ask significant questions,” Jeff and Hunter sang in the catchy number “Two Nobodies in New York.” “We could get important points across / Like? Are we writing for art? / And is art a springboard for fame? / And will fame get us a paycheck? / But will a paycheck mean that we’re sellouts?”
The production’s success stemmed from the company’s renditions of “[title of show]”’s songs, which Broadway die-hards in particular could appreciate. Replete with references to Bernadette Peters, Ben Vereen, and other Broadway greats, the show catered to people who love musical theater as much as the actors themselves and mocked anyone who merely “wants to see Paris Hilton as Mame.” Viewers in the inner circle—that is, who could share in the Broadway jokes—might have had trouble stifling their laughter throughout the production. Indeed, it was clear that the actors (all of whom also served as directors) channeled their passion for musical theater into their performances and had a blast both with one another and the Broadway-ness of it all. For a viewer unacquainted with Tavern on the Green parties and Shubert Alley, however, the show might not have been as enjoyable.
The actors moved in and out of scenes by announcing their own stage directions, which they promptly followed—making it clear that, at its core, the show was about people coming together for the love of writing a show. “Are we in this scene now?” Heidi asked, after a musical number in which she and Susan inspired Jeff and Hunter to overcome their writer’s block. “I thought we were your spirit guides,” Susan added. The production’s overall tone remained conversational and upbeat, with jazz-hand-heavy dance numbers and late-night takeout phone calls adding to that levity. Ultimately, “[title of show]” was a feel-good experience.
Some transitions between scenes, however, were not as strong. When the set’s single spotlight faded to black, pre-recorded voicemail messages among castmates—messages designed to advance the plot—played as the festival deadline approached. The messages, more like inside jokes between friends, felt a bit scattered and drawn-out and did not link the disparate scenes as they were intended to do. The show’s musical numbers spoke for themselves, strengthening the bonds among actors and highlighting their love for their work; in contrast, the voicemails did not move the story forward.
Despite these garbled phone messages, the cast members formed close ties in scenes throughout the production. In fact, several actors had worked on “Dogfight” last semester and clearly continued to build relationships onstage. Whenever Rienstra, Potterton, Sweeney, and Phillips were together, at times discussing outlandish ideas and breaking into exaggerated dance moves (think frozen vegetables, monkeys and speedboats, and increasingly large bottles of soda), their energy was contagious. Watching this particular group of friends act out their love of the theater became much more than simply seeing a cast of actors perform. “I’d rather be nine people’s favorite thing than a hundred people’s ninth favorite thing,” they sang in a scene toward the end of the production. In the end, while “[title of show]” may not be a hundred people’s ninth favorite thing, it certainly has the potential to be nine people’s favorite thing.

"This is a demonstration of 10,000 hours of practice," said Jill Johnson, dance director and senior lecturer in Harvard’s Department of Music. Standing in front of five Boston Ballet dancers on stage in the Harvard Dance Center on a frigid Friday night, she introduced them for a rehearsal and Q&A organized by the Ballet as part of their Dance Talk program.
The program featured excerpts from William Forsythe’s 1996 work "The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude" as well as selections from Hans van Manen’s 1989 piece "Black Cake," both of which the Boston Ballet will perform this spring. The event began with a staging demonstration by Johnson in which she rehearsed the choreography of "Vertiginous" with the dancers, followed by a performance-style exhibition of "Black Cake." The dances were succeeded by a Q&A session with Mikko Nissinen, artistic director of the Boston Ballet, Johnson, and company dancers Dusty Button and Bradley Schlagheck. While both pieces were examples of neoclassicism—they reworked classical-era ballet in a more contemporary style—the performances offered glimpses into the Boston Ballet’s programmatic ambitions to expand beyond popular repertoire this season to solidify the company’s place at the forefront of contemporary ballet.
At the event, the Boston Ballet showcased work that members described as deeply challenging but rewarding. "[‘Vertiginous’] is like a box of power bars," Johnson said during her rehearsal demonstration, alluding to the ballet’s character as a kinetic flurry of movement that is incredibly technically demanding. She also elaborated on the philosophy behind Forsythe’s choreography: "What is important is being able to individualize, building on the tradition of ballet as an offering to say, this is what I think about art." The piece, according to Johnson, uses ballet as a vocabulary to ask how far classicism can be pushed—and it turns out that it can be stretched farther than one might think. Button and Schlagheck discussed how working with Forsythe’s ballet is consequently more liberating than working with traditional ballet forms, even allowing them to start rehearsals with hip-hop music. "It takes a second to realize that you have the opportunity to explore the swag," Schlagheck said.
The central focus of "Black Cake," on the other hand, consisted of three pas de deux in which the power dynamics of each couple rapidly shifted in a bizarre fashion. In the Q&A, the speakers used these unconventional duets as a platform to expound on the changing gender politics in ballet. "The level of analysis applied to a work depends on how much of our contemporary outlook we expect a work to hold," Johnson said. "Black Cake," with its uneven gender dynamics, is a relic, the speakers said; today’s choreographers are instead interested in the relationship between the male and the female, a relationship that is no longer always binary. The speakers also described their relationship with music as the backbone of dance; according to them, the exploration involved in neoclassicism centers around climbing in and around music in many different ways.
Audience members said that the Boston Ballet dance talk exposed them to a different kind of intellect than is found in the everyday circuit of classes in the Science Center and long nights at Lamont. "It’s important for Harvard students to be able to see the role of the ballet in our greater arts community and...how accessible it is," said Mary-Grace R. Reeves ‘16, the founder of the Harvard chapter of the Boston Ballet College Ambassadors Program. Friday’s performance offered a glimpse into the thinking of professionals who bridge the cerebral and the kinetic—and imparted a reminder that an appreciation of dance is, as Reeves said, something that all can make part of their Harvard experience.

“I got really into creases. Jeans crease in all kinds of interesting ways: honeycomb, whisker, train-track, stack…I catalogued no fewer than seventeen different crease-types, each of which has slightly different innuendos.” So explains U., the unnamed narrator and protagonist of critically acclaimed avant-garde author and artist Tom McCarthy’s newest novel, “Satin Island.” U. goes on to reveal his secret for framing the value of these minutiae to the client, Levi’s: He repurposes French philosophers Deleuze and Badiou, respectively, of their concepts of “le pli” (fold) and the “rip,” stripping them, as he says, of “all the revolutionary shit” and “radical baggage” and applying this figurative vocabulary to the literal folds and rips in a pair of jeans. The passage is an apt synecdoche for the rest of the novel. “Satin Island” explores the nature of “meaning” for a man whose job it is to find meaning in everything and repackage it with a narrative. Some of the book’s best moments are its references to philosophy and history—simplified, like Deleuze’s folds and Badiou’s rip, to sound almost like fairytales. At its worst, U.’s obsessive search for significance may become tedious for his readers; yet, on the whole, McCarthy has written an engaging work that forces the reader to reassess “meaning” itself.
U., an anthropologist and “corporate ethnographer” working for “The Company” on the “Koob-Sassen” project, as well as on something called the “Great Report.” These names are deliberately made to sound cryptic. U. tells readers flat-out that he will not and cannot give details on the Koob-Sassen project—and as for the Great Report, not even U. himself quite understands what it is. Instead, U. tells about his private obsessions, of which he has many, including oil spills and a parachutist’s death in which he suspects foul play. The novel, specific and vague in all the wrong places, has hints of Samuel Beckett and Alain Robbe-Grillet and even the faux-noir flavor of Thomas Pynchon. It also has a slight James Joyce aftertaste as one emerges from the swamp of U.’s stream of consciousness. On the whole, however, structurally and in its synthesis of different experimental techniques, “Satin Island” is one of a kind.
McCarthy has a rare appreciation for the intersection of beauty and hilarity, seriousness and irreverence. He excels at clever wordplay and whimsical one-liners. For example, U. casually reassembles words to emphasize the condition of inhabiting one’s work— “The Report might somehow…be be-d, rather than written”—and to sum up architectural embellishments—“all such wedding-cakery.” After the Koob-Sassen project goes live, U. says, “Its implementation had been deemed a great success. By whom? I don’t know. Deemers. And the Company’s contribution had been praised, by praisers, as quite brilliant.” But beyond and through such lighthearted remarks, McCarthy is also capable of driving at serious truths, as when U.’s friend Petr, dying of cancer, laments that there will be no one to tell about his death, or when U.’s girlfriend, Madison, explains the necessity of withholding information in relationships.
McCarthy also has a magic touch for imbuing his descriptions of real events and phenomena with the aura of fiction. His key technique is to describe them in terms of patterns and systems (as is U.’s wont). U. explains the rituals of Vanuatu and his colleague Daniel details the traffic jams of Lagos and the paved streets of Paris in this way: The Nigerian highway, for example, becomes “sequences of alternation and progression...helix-maps of DNA”—symmetry and diagrammatic perfection are thus revealed to be integral elements of story. For a reader unfamiliar with McCarthy’s previous work, it is perhaps only through these passages that one would glean the author’s immense talent for traditional storytelling.
Barring, to a certain extent, these brief anecdotal asides, McCarthy’s narrative style is anything but traditional. “Satin Island” is entirely driven by U.’s internal monologue—essentially continuous, borderline schizophrenic exposition—which is alternately enjoyable and unpleasant. U. goes to great lengths to describe the most trivial and minute of details, in which he finds grand sense and drama. Conversely, U. defines what would seem to most readers as real tragedy in terms of the banal when he cares to provide any description of these things at all. As a result, McCarthy forces readers to reevaluate what it means for something to have or to lack. This is especially marked in places where readers are likely to disagree with U.’s own ridiculous assessments, as when, for example, he expounds on the divine righteousness of oil spills. As U. explains from the beginning, he and his company “dealt…in narratives.” It only takes the right rhetorical spin to make something seem meaningful. Far from changing one’s mind, then, about what is and isn’t significant, a reader is likely to come away with a sense of renewed priorities. There is something special gained in the process of stripping meaning away and planting it anew.
Granted, the process by which McCarthy goes about uprooting meaning may begin to weary the reader. U.’s unorthodox narration is given structure by the novel’s unorthodox format. Each of the book’s fourteen chapters is further segmented into roughly page-long fragments, numbered 1.1, 1.2, etc. Like line breaks in a poem, these disjunctions lend a weightier significance to each segment’s concluding line. The forced punctuation of often-meaningless statements, however, soon becomes irritating. Similarly, as the novel progresses, U.’s extended descriptions and in-depth analyses of oil and parachutists begin to drag. The formula U. seems to apply to eke out meaning from anything becomes unimpressively predictable, as U becomes less trustworthy and more neurotic and self-indulgent. He has an existentialist’s keen nihilistic self-awareness, yet he lacks the requisite ownership of responsibility. While these qualities may be necessary for the text to succeed at a meta level, the cost is a novel that at times falls short of entertaining. That said, when McCarthy has had his way with readers’ preconceived notions of “meaning,” the result is, to a moderate degree, transformative.

Alia Ali is a Yemeni-Bosnian-American artist who expresses herself through both photography and digital storytelling. Informed by her travels through Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, Ali’s photography captures the cultures and lifestyles she encounters. In “Process,” her exhibition at the Monroe C. Gutman Library Gallery that opened Feb. 14, she presents a collection of photos illustrating her perceptions of the human experience from her latest travels.
The Harvard Crimson: What was your goal with “Process”?
Alia Ali: What motivated me in the images that I chose for this exhibition is that all of us have the same needs…. Once we fulfill these needs, we get the same fulfillment. In this I believe that humans are the same. At the same moment, there is a process that is between that need and the fulfillment. That's what makes us exceptionally and beautifully different.... In all of this, it's the process.
THC: What inspired you to focus on the idea of “Process” in particular?
AA: The word "process" is a reminder that life is a process. These images are also literally processed. There has been work done on them and I hope that people will come and see them. I don't use any captioning here because I want people to engage and tell their story and they're welcome to write to me and ask me about my story…. It's a reflection of them and I am inviting them to reflect about what has been processed and the process.
THC: Many of your pictures contain hands and fingers—is that intentional or does it just happen to come up a lot?
AA: It's intentional…. As I was traveling around, I saw pink potatoes, which is also featured in this exhibition. It was a woman who was making these potatoes that are shocking pink. And I have never seen nor touched them in my life. There are many people who see this exhibition who will go throughout their entire lives without ever touching pink potatoes. This woman touches it every single day. It is a process of how she nourishes herself. That fascinates me…. When you're looking at the hand, in the hands themselves, how the hands touch, you can learn a lot about someone. It's also a way for me that you don't have to do a portrait of a person to do their portrait.
THC: What brings you to Harvard in particular?
AA: For me, [exhibiting at Harvard] completely fell in line with the work that I do because...it was something I dealt with as the director of operations for the Marrakech Biennale…. [O]ver there, there's art everywhere—inherent in the work, architecture, the way people dress, the music—yet there are certain things that are missing. For example, the occupation of an artist doesn't exist there…. I used to be a teacher.... It goes hand in hand with my art as an education: art is about engaging, making people think about things in a different way. That's why there are workshops as a part of the exhibition. There has to be the dialogue.
THC: Have you considered using film as a medium?
AA: I am actually trained as a documentary filmmaker…. My thesis was a documentary about the tribal system in Yemen. It was a way of me trying to make people understand the beauty of Yemen…. The minute I showed it for the final night, I realized I made a big mistake. I had narrated it. I had almost fed what I was trying to get out of the people…. I found myself moving towards photography…. You look at an image and it has so much power. People can look and listen and feel united. It's timeless. I'd like to explore that with my images as a dialogue.
THC:  What do you hope audiences take away from “Process?”
AA: Everything that I do is very much about self-reflection, and I hope that people have time to do self-reflection…. As I said, there is a mirror in this, and it's a reminder for people to reflect, to see themselves as a part of this exhibition essentially…. It's wonderful that people see an image, and even if they are disturbed by an image, they've reacted to it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joy, an enigmatic young woman brooding in the confines of a futuristic New England hospital ward, asks variations of the same angst-ridden question over and over: “Is there any greater mystery than the separateness of each person?” Identity is constituted in large part by memories, but as the protagonist of Laura Van Den Berg’s riveting debut novel, “Find Me,” Joy is troubled by memories that she cannot fully piece together. Most of these are random fragments from her moves between foster parents: art museum security guards, a dental office receptionist with gold toenails who wears a pink tracksuit, group homes. Van Den Berg’s fierce depiction of Joy’s struggle to understand the mystery of her blurry past is effectively captured through her clever manipulation of readers and the subtle dystopia of Joy’s internal world, which ultimately makes for a surprisingly relatable story.
The context in which Joy’s personal psychological drama plays out is also one of mental uncertainty. Joy lives in an apocalyptic society plagued by a lethal disease that causes extreme memory loss and eventual death: “Autopsies showed prions eating through brain tissue, leading to sudden neurological collapse, but once they got everything under the microscopes, they realized it was something different, something new. We were awash in theories—biological attack, apocalypse, environmental meltdown—and no solutions. Our brains, our greatest human asset, were disintegrating.” Joy, who claims to be immune to the disease, is serving as a case study in a hospital with other patients. But her narrative itself soon begins to disintegrate.
Perhaps the most exciting feature of the story is Joy’s unexpected betrayal of the readers’ trust, which is established in Van Den Berg’s deceptively simple and straightforward style in creating Joy’s voice. Because the book is told from Joy’s perspective and because there are very few other characters—the others either die of an illness, or they are people like the doctor who serve as a means for conveying information—it’s easy to gain a false sense of trust in the narrator and the story she is telling. For example, when telling a dream of her mom, Joy goes into great detail: “She is faceless, but I know it’s her. We are both staring into the glass. There’s a gold coin in the bottom. We want to get it out, but don’t know how.” These succinct, Hemingway-esque statements risk becoming off-putting for the reader, who may feel they are just factual. However, it later becomes apparent that there is a reason for this seemingly annoying stylistic choice. One day Joy exclaims, “In the hallway a patient screams and it takes me a second to realize the screaming person is me.” Suddenly Joy doesn’t seem so reliable. The distance between the memories she claims to be recording and her mental state only grows larger.
Joy’s unreliability is captivating, but at times Van Den Berg could have presented it more effectively. The novel begins with scenes of Joy in the hospital, yet the story is structured so that flashbacks of Joy’s life before the hospital are sprinkled throughout. Through these flashbacks, the reader comes to understand the magnitude and depth of Joy’s loneliness. At times the structure of the story is hard to follow because, as the novel continues, it becomes increasingly difficult to decipher which plot line is the life she is living and which ones are comprised of flashbacks. Additionally, nearly every section and chapter ends with a quotable piece of insight; at first it is poetic, but after some time, Van Den Berg seems to be over-relying on these pieces of wisdom to keep the reader’s interest anchored and the suspense high. Joy frequently says things like, “I wonder if anyone is watching. If anyone will ever tell my story. If anyone will remember.” This feels overdone, as if Van Den Berg is hiding Joy behind quotes instead of explaining the situation at hand, and it becomes quite confusing.
But it is that feeling of confusion, the ever-shifting questions implanted in the minds of readers as the novel unfolds, that brings the story to life. Though the novel’s setting is dystopian, it’s easy to identify with the characters because of the common traits and suffering in the novel—specifically the plague of loneliness, the craving for purpose, and the desire to be more than an anonymous and invisible individual. Most importantly, Van Den Berg emphasizes the way we perceive our own lives—can we trust our own memory? What truly sets this dystopian novel apart, then, is the realization that this dystopia is completely plausible and possible. The disease, though its cause is not certain, is often referred to as one caused completely by the mind—and one that could potentially be cured by the mind.
Despite the wild and positively confusing ride the reader is in for when reading this novel, Van Den Berg has successfully shaped this story into one that emphasizes the unique powers of the mind. “Find Me”’s hauntingly beautiful dystopia promises to overturn assumptions about the truth of memory and perception in reading.

"Believe it or not—and I know that most people do not—violence has been in decline for long stretches of time. Today, we may be living in the most peaceful era in our existence," Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker said on Feb. 13. In his book "The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined," Pinker contends that physical violence has steadily diminished through the course of human history. And yet, according to the Project LENS team, this trend away from violence is not reflected in classical music, where modern composers often fuse their work with heavy percussion, drastic tempo changes, and the occasional shriek. Fans of contemporary classical music may have noted a rise in aggression within the genre itself.
Lecture and performance "Project LENS: The Myth of Modern Violence," which took place in Paine Hall last Friday, sought to reconcile Pinker’s controversial notion with the popular opinion that classical music has gradually become more harsh, dissonant, and violent over time. A joint effort among Project LENS, the Grammy Award-winning Parker Quartet, and Harvard’s own Pinker, the event examined both what violence means and how exactly composers translate it into music.
Project LENS (Live Exchange of Notes and Sounds) is a collaborative aiming to illuminate the relationships between music and a multitude of topics, including evolution, humor, and law. Founded by three recent Harvard graduates (Ariel S. Mitnick ’13, Rainer A. Crosett ’14, and Alan M. Toda-Ambaras ’13), the group weaves together a TalkThread—a story or idea, similar to a TedTalk—and a MusicThread, a selection of pieces played by a combination of local musicians and members. For Mitnick, Project LENS serves not only as a means of synthesizing music with a plethora of seemingly unrelated subjects but also as a way for audiences to better relate to an under-appreciated genre. "There are these barriers to entry for people who might not already be invested in learning about [classical music]. If you already don’t know about it, it might just sound like a wash of sound," Mitnick says. "We’re interested in providing points of entry for people who aren’t familiar with the music."
"The Myth of Modern Violence" came into being when the LENS team approached Pinker after reading his works and thinking he would be an engaging collaborative partner. The event marked the first time LENS had recruited a fully-formed music group as opposed to individual musicians. The Parker Quartet, the current Blodgett Artists-in-Residence, were more than willing to participate. "We really liked the idea of what they were going for—trying to connect music with other disciplines," quartet violinist Daniel T. Chong says.
During the event, the quartet played four pieces, including Heinrich Biber’s "Battalia a 9" and the second movement of Franz Schubert’s "Death and the Maiden." The selections were interspersed with sections of Pinker’s own talk, where he cited a major decline in interpersonal attacks, reduction in torture methods, and the abolition of slavery as evidence for the decrease in violence through history. Between dynamic performances, various members of the LENS team analyzed the more esoteric aspects of the music—its historical context, the composer’s inspirations and motivations, and musical techniques that most clearly conveyed violence. "We want to ask questions about the kinds of decisions composers make when they incorporate violent sounds into their music and what their intentions are when doing so," Crosett says.
The stark juxtaposition of sound from piece to piece solidified LENS’s thesis—that composers have experimented with themes of violence throughout history, centuries before our own. Members of Project LENS say that it is not the frequency of strident, violent-sounding music that has changed, but rather the audience’s interpretation of what violence is and how it is aurally expressed. "Even though there are certain changes that are unique to music over time, we see that there are patterns in the evolution of aesthetics across all media and how meaning is processed from them," Toda-Ambaras says.
Regardless of the answer to the night’s central question, the team isn’t focused on indoctrinating its audience with its ideas. "We love thinking about these connections and debating them amongst ourselves, and we really hope people will continue the debate when they leave," Mitnick says. "Our goal is really to get a conversation started."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 17, 2015, at 10:06 p.m.
With the unfolding of the Brian Williams scandal this past week, Americans witnessed the downfall of one of the country’s preeminent journalists. Williams, the chief anchor and managing editor for NBC's "Nightly News," was suspended from air for six months after revealing that he had fabricated a story about being aboard a helicopter during the 2003 Iraq War that was shot down by enemy RPG fire over Iraq. Williams’s actions are a disturbing transgression of journalistic standards. But even more unsettling is how they reflect on the state of the media, and on how most Americans today get their news.
With his good looks and smooth voice, Williams rose to the top of the journalism world. As host of NBC's “Nightly News,” he averaged 10 million viewers per night. He was the 23rd most-trusted person in America according to research firm The Market Arm (a rank that dropped to 835th following the scandal).
But this fame appears to have had a price. The goal of journalism is to communicate information accurately, and journalists should hold this principle as sacrosanct. But in “misremember[ing]” the helicopter incident and now perhaps in his coverage of Hurricane Katrina, Williams abandoned his journalistic responsibilities. He put himself and his celebrity above the principles of his job, which detracted from his ability to convey accurate facts to the public.
Williams’s fall from grace is certainly lamentable. But this is more than an isolated incident; Williams’s actions should serve as a wake-up call to the current state of the American media and to the mindset of those who consume it. In an age when 87 percent of Americans receive at least some of their news from television, and in which TV is more cited as a news source than any other medium, anchors and pundits are increasingly glorified as celebrities rather than as journalists.
Television news is being ever more sensationalized, while an emphasis on keeping viewers entertained is leaving them less and less informed. This has serious implications for our civic life. It is worth noting those with Williams’s job in the United Kingdom are called “news readers.” They are tasked with simply reading the day’s events, without writing or producing stories and without the attached celebrity.
Williams’s failure to uphold his journalistic integrity is a sign that news outlets need to return to the basic principles of journalism. Aspiring and rising journalists should pursue the field because of a passion for finding and conveying information, not because they hope to become the center of attention. And news organizations should hold to their obligation of informing, not entertaining, their audiences. Brian Williams was unable to maintain this principle, and he is now facing the consequences. His actions are symptomatic of wider problems in the media, and should serve as a warning to the American TV news establishment.
This editorial has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 17, 2015
An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly identified the war at the center of the Brian Williams controversy. In fact, Brian Williams fabricated a story about being aboard a helicopter during the 2003 Iraq War.

Overheard at a party I attended during winter break:
“Are you in college?”
“Yeah. So what brought you to Boston?”
“Where are you at college?”
“What?”
“Where do you go to college?”
“I’m-at-Harvard-ha-ha-not-exactly-far-from-home—so you’re from D.C.?”
Okay, I didn’t overhear that. I participated. I was the H-bomb avoider.
Though the nature of its influence has been debated, “dropping the H-Bomb,” or telling someone you go to Harvard, has been widely recognized by our community as a powerful move.
But, good or bad, why do we attach so much value to this gesture? When my roommates started buzzing about their newfound ability to read their admissions files, I began to wonder why we, as college students, still care so much about the choice someone made to let us come here in the first place.
I think we care for the same reason we think the “H-bomb” is such a big deal—not because we go to Harvard, but because we got into Harvard. These things seem important because we were taught that low admission rates are important. That selectivity translates to success—or, even worse, self-worth.
Because we put the details of our academics, passions, and personal qualities on our college applications, there’s this odd sense that the “yes” or “no” we get back is a definitive judgment of our identity.
Most of my friends who say they want to look at the files that got them here cite validation as their main impetus. But by making the effort to acquire these Admissions Committee comments, a student conveys that what got her into Harvard is still reflective of, and crucial to, her character.
Looking for validation in an admissions record just validates the assumption that Harvard’s (or any college’s) selection process defines those who participate in it. It turns acceptance letters into lifelong affirmations of self.
Instead, we should put an end to the myth that our admission to a particular college—and the reasons behind it—merits self-acceptance.
So clearly I go here, and I was psyched about getting in. I actively avoid the H-bomb. But to reinforce why I shouldn’t let my status as an admitted student give me too much of an ego boost, let’s consider how personal qualities have factored into Harvard’s admissions process in the past.
Rewind to 1922, when President A. Lawrence Lowell started getting nervous that too many Jews were attending Harvard. He tried quotas, he tried limiting scholarships for Jewish students, but only one strategy stuck—shifting focus from an applicant’s academics to his character.
This new process allowed admissions officers to look for indicators that the applicant belonged to a group of “undesirables,” which became code for Jews. If evidence showed that an applicant belonged to this category, he or she was generally rejected. The year after Lowell instituted this policy, Jewish enrollment plummeted from around 20 to 8.2 percent.
Harvard currently frames its applicants’ interests, activities, and personalities as marks of future success, and while I do believe a diverse community with myriad interests is important to a school’s environment, the roots of this process are pretty arbitrary. It was not created as part of some genius method to determine value in a human being.
Additionally, plenty of deserving students don’t go, or oftentimes even apply, to top colleges for reasons completely out of their control. To state the obvious again, acceptance letters or their absence does nothing to determine a person’s worth.
We should love Harvard for the experiences we’ve had here, not the ego boost it gave us in a congratulatory email. Let’s discard notions of the "Big H" as a part of us that is so powerful it can be likened to a bomb. Let’s not limit ourselves to comments that strangers wrote about us before we were even old enough to vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here’s a confession. Outside of historical visits, choir concerts, and dutiful trips with my parents, I’ve been to church exactly once. I was sixteen and I had just lost my virginity at camp—yes, camp. I had also drunk my first drink, smoked my first cigarette and checked off a laundry list of other “firsts” that teenagers tend to rush through in their mad dash to adulthood. I returned to my hometown half-proud, half-ashamed, and terrified to tell anyone I knew. My problem wasn’t finding someone per se—I had several friends who I knew would congratulate me and pry for juicy details. The challenge was finding someone who would take it as seriously as I did.
While I was spilling my secrets in a dark confessional booth, millions of similarly angst-ridden teens were sharing their stories online. Assisted by the Internet, our generation has made a lifestyle out of personal revelations. Many of us began having semi-public discussions about our sexuality, mental health, and gender identity as early as middle school, and social media platforms like Formspring.me, Whisper and Yik Yak have made it easier to tell faceless millions about our secrets. For the most part, our generation’s confessional culture has contributed to decreased prejudice. Yet while the culture of sharing has made the political aspect of our identities more salient, it also tends to obscure our individual stories.
Because most sharing apps favor a popularity-based model, a very small range of narratives tend to dominate the media landscape. Confessions that entertain or resonate with us get voted up while others fade into obscurity. On Youtube, the coming out story has emerged as its own genre, complete with unsettling compilations that purport to rank the “most inspirational” videos on the platform. Unsurprisingly, the most popular entries in this genre feature conventionally attractive white boys and their accepting parents. Meanwhile, those with less polished, easily consumed narratives may endure the double trauma of having their singular experiences sidelined or ignored.
The basements of confessional culture run deep. Although a tremendous number of tweets, videos, and posts are produced every day, very few receive more than a handful of views.  As a result, while the volume of shared Internet content continues to rise, Americans report feeling more isolated than ever.
This semester, in a course I'm taking on the autobiography, I’ve talked a lot about genre and whether it is even possible to write so intensely about a single person any more. If religion, institutions, and family can no longer command our attention or respect, how can we demand the same as individuals? Beyond their entertainment value, what are individual histories worth?
I won’t pretend that I have the answer. Six years after my turn in the confessional booth, I am less certain than ever. Every ounce of eighteen-year old certainty that I brought to college has been replaced by a relentless spirit of self-questioning and self-doubt. I am once again at a crossroads, terrified of a future that is not entirely clear. I’m still not sure what to think or how to feel.
More than ever, I find myself falling back on my instincts and intuition. On faith.
I still believe in the individual. I still believe in the soul. I still believe our stories are important. And they deserve better than what our culture offers them.

Harvard Law School has received comment from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights on its new procedures for handling cases of alleged sexual harassment and will implement those procedures “as soon as possible,” according to Robb London, a Law School spokesperson.
The Law School faculty voted to adopt a set of new procedures governing its approach to investigating sexual harassment allegations in December, moving to break from Harvard’s University-wide Title IX procedures, which last year established a central office to hear student complaints across schools.
The feedback from OCR on the Law School’s new procedures focused mainly on clarifications and suggestions but not on procedural objections, according to London. The Law School is now revising its procedures for final approval from the federal government, in keeping with a resolution agreement forged after the Law School was found in violation of Title IX late last year.
“There were no objections to the procedures—just a few suggestions and requested clarifications of the text in a couple of places, which we have now made,” London wrote in an email Monday.
The Law School has created a new draft reflecting OCR’s suggestions and sent it to OCR for final review and sign-off, according to London. He declined to share a copy of OCR’s feedback and would not specify what parts of the procedures the government asked the Law School to clarify.
As part of its resolution agreement with the government following the Title IX decision, the Law School submitted its new procedures to OCR for review. The new Law School procedures significantly break from the University’s central Title IX framework; instead of sending complaints to Harvard’s central Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, under the new procedures, the Law School will conduct its own sexual harassment investigations in-house.
The Law School faculty adopted the new procedures after faculty members publicly declared their discontent with the new University-wide sexual harassment framework. Twenty-eight Law School professors penned an open letter in The Boston Globe in October, arguing that Harvard’s policy and procedures lack due process and are biased against the accused. Some time later, Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow appointed a committee, chaired by Law School professor John Coates, to create a new set of Title IX procedures specific to the Law School.
Minow and Coates declined to comment on OCR’s feedback on the procedures.
Twenty of the 28 Professors who signed the Globe letter also actively lobbied the faculty committee for certain procedural changes last fall. They circulated a memo requesting, among other points, that the Law School investigate its own sexual harassment complaints and offer legal counsel to all involved parties.
According to a statement on the Law School’s website, students will be notified when the new procedures are implemented.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 17, 2015, at 1:21 a.m.
The International Women’s Day exhibit at Harvard Law School will no longer honor Robin Steinberg, the executive director of the Bronx Defenders, a non-profit provider of public defense services in New York City. The annual Law School exhibit, which honors women in the legal profession, revoked its invitation to Steinberg following backlash for her link to the controversial YouTube video “Hands Up.”
Steinberg has come under criticism, as some say the video’s lyrics and images appear to endorse killing white police officers in retaliation for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, unarmed black men who were killed by white police officers this summer. Two lawyers from the Bronx Defenders were featured in the video, and a New York City Investigation revealed that Steinberg did not check the contents of the video before allowing her employees to take part.
Steinberg, who was not in the video, is currently serving a 60-day suspension from her job.
The Women’s Law Association and the Law and International Development  Society—the two groups that organized the International Women’s Day exhibit—released a statement Monday retracting their invitation and condemning violence towards police officers.
They stated, “In view of the questions that have been raised and the controversy that has unfolded, we have decided to refrain from including Ms. Steinberg in this year's exhibit, because of the investigation into her response to the actions of defenders in her office. We did not intend for her nomination to suggest in any way that it is acceptable to harm police officers or incite others to do so.”
The statement adds that if Steinberg were vindicated, the two groups would consider Steinberg for a future exhibit.
The leaders of the group did not comment beyond their statement.

The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations announced Friday that it would honor Eva Longoria, a renowned actress, activist, and philanthropist of Mexican-American heritage, as the 2015 Harvard University Artist of the Year. The award ceremony will take place at the foundation’s 30th annual Cultural Rhythms Festival on Feb. 21.
“Eva Longoria stood out to us as a fitting recipient of this award because she has used her celebrity status as a means of creating positive change in the world,” Cultural Rhythms Festival co-director Cary A. Williams ’16 wrote in an email.
The Artist of the Year medal, the foundation's most prestigious award, recognizes artists who are heavily involved in humanitarian and philanthropic issues.
Famous for her acting and film roles, Longoria has appeared in “Beverly Hills, 90210,” “General Hospital,” and “The Young and the Restless.” Her role in the TV series “Desperate Housewives” earned her a Choice TV Female Breakout Performance at the Teen Choice Awards.
“We wanted one who not only has great star power but also someone who has used their immense celebrity platform to help the communities around them and someone who represents a background that is underrepresented in the arts world,” said Irfan Mahmud ’16, a Cultural Rhythms Festival co-director and an inactive Crimson news editor.
In addition to her acting career, Longoria is involved in several philanthropic causes. She founded the Eva Longoria Foundation, which helps equip Latina women with education and entrepreneurial skills. In 2006, she founded Eva’s Heroes, a charity dedicated to aiding developmentally disabled teenagers and young adults.
She also has supported the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and has served as a spokesperson for Padres Contra el Cancer, a non-profit organization that works to aid cancer-stricken Latino children and their families. In 2009, The Hollywood Reporter honored Longoria as Philanthropist of the Year for her service to the community and, in particular, her commitment to Latino issues.
“From empowering and educating young girls in Latin America to founding a charity for developmentally disabled children to hosting numerous benefits for cancer research, Eva Longoria has a longstanding commitment to make this world a better place,” Mahmud said.
Previous winners of the Artist of the Year award include Queen Latifah, Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Salma Hayek, Andy Garcia, and Shakira.
“That’s the essence of Cultural Rhythms,” Williams said. “It is a celebration of art from around the world, and we hope that it is also a forum for promoting intercultural awareness and understanding.”

Students will likely be required to make an affirmation of integrity before taking final exams and writing final papers should members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approve the legislation of the College’s first-ever honor code.
The FAS Faculty Council voted in support of such legislation at their meeting last week. The changes will be brought to the full FAS faculty for discussion at their next meeting on March 3, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
Then, “if all goes well,” Harris wrote in an email, the Faculty would vote, at their April meeting, on the finalized honor code and affirmation procedures, which would likely go into effect in fall of 2015.
In their May 2014 meeting in which they approved the honor code, the full FAS Faculty specified that Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana would “bring to the Faculty Council a recommendation regarding the nature and frequency” of the affirmation. However, Harris wrote in an email that he himself brought the recommendations on behalf of the Committee on Academic Integrity.
Two Council members said they were satisfied with the Council’s decision regarding the affirmation’s frequency, which has been a topic of concern among Faculty throughout discussions on the honor code.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Stacey A. Combes, a member of the Faculty Council—the highest elected body in FAS—said that in early discussions, the body debated requiring students to make an affirmation before every assignment but ultimately decided against it.
“There was a bit of debate in terms of whether that sends a bad message, that it assumes students are cheating, and that they have to write this thing,” Combes said.
East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor and Faculty Council member Mark C. Elliott said the Council “is satisfied that we’ve hit probably the right spot in terms of frequency.”
“There were people who were concerned that to have some sort of a statement or affirmation for every single lab and every single paper and assignment of any kind was probably too much and might potentially turn what needs to be a meaningful affirmation into a kind of routine, and lose its meaning.”
Members of FAS approved the honor code itself in May 2014, establishing formal expectations of integrity and a judicial body of faculty, administrators, and students for violations of those expectations. That body, known as the Honor Council, will be comprised of 12 undergraduates and 12 others from a pool of faculty, teaching fellows, and resident or House deans and take most, if not all, cheating cases from the Administrative Board’s jurisdiction.
On Friday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that the Honor Council and Ad Board will be housed together in a new Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, which will replace the Office of the Secretary of the Ad Board in July.

Boston Police are investigating after an unidentified male Longwood Medical Area employee was attacked from behind and robbed of his wallet as he was unlocking his bike from a rack on Friday night.
The incident occurred at 8:40 PM, between Vanderbilt Hall and the New Research Building, and the two offenders were unarmed, according to an community advisory statement issued by Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
Catalano indicated that the incident occurred outside of University property, but added that BPD will handled the investigation.
“The victim stated [that] while walking up the loading dock toward the street he was approached from behind and was thrown against a fence. One offender took the victim’s wallet, while another offender stood guard,” the advisory read.
The two offenders fled the scene and were seen heading towards The Fenway, the parkway that runs along the southern and eastern edges of the Back Bay Fens. It is currently unknown if there were any additional witnesses or if the incident was captured by a security camera.
Reflecting on the incident, the advisory urged students to “trust [their] instincts” and to take extra measures to be aware of their surroundings.

UPDATED: February 16, 2015, at 7:30 p.m.
The Harvard skiing team extended its streak of top-10 finishes to five this weekend with a 10th place finish at the Middlebury Carnival. The Crimson had a strong performance overall, coming in the top 10 as a team in six of the eight events.
It was a frigid weekend as temperatures were below zero most of the weekend, dropping as low as -14 degrees, along with moderate snowfall throughout.
“Weather conditions were challenging for pretty much everybody,” Nordic coach Christopher City said. “We had a few issues with people breathing in those low temperatures.”
Led by senior Akeo Maifeld-Carucci, the team totaled 224 points overall. Maifeld-Carucci finished sixth overall with a time of 26:05.1 in the 10k freestyle on Saturday after a 19th place finish in the 10K classic race on Friday. Maifeld-Carucci skied through sickness on Friday but would be one of the Carnival’s top nordic skiers over the weekend.
Sophomore Ian Meyer and classmate Devlin Shea followed Maifeld-Carucci in 43rd and 44th. Meyer posted a time of 28:14.3 with Shea behind him with a time of 28:14.5. The finishes were good for 23 points between the two skiers. Junior Soren Anderson and freshman Haakon Sigurslid closed the race for Harvard, coming in 50th and 51st place, respectively.
On the women’s side, junior Annie Harvieux finished top 30 in the women’s 5K freestyle. Harvieux was followed closely by sophomore Rachel Hampton, who crossed the line in 33rd place. Senior Emily Rogers and junior Hanna Barnes closed the race with 47th and 48th place finishes, respectively; the Nordic women would contribute 44 points on Saturday alone.
Hampton also had a solid performance in the 10K classic race, finishing 25th with a time of 33:57.6. The performance was the Telluride, Colo., native’s second top-25 finish in the event this season. Sophomore Maile Sapp finished the race in 31st with a time of 34:39.1, while Harvieux joined her teammates in the top 40 with a 36th place finish.
On the alpine side of the carnival, freshman Kelly Steeves came in 41st place in the women’s slalom and notched a 34th place finish in the giant slalom. She was the only Harvard athlete to place in either of these events. Alpine coach Tim Mitchell expressed a lot of confidence in the freshman.
“Kelly Steeves is having a real good freshman year,” Mitchell said. “She skied pretty well.”
Despite several injuries on the men’s alpine team, the men also had a strong performance at the slalom with Simon Merryweather and James Stevenson finishing 50th and 51st, respectively. Freshman Pieter Weemaes came within one place of qualifying for Saturday's run. Mitchell expressed nothing but confidence towards the way the rookies have been performing as the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Championship approaches.
“I was definitely happy with the progress of the freshman,” Mitchell said. “I feel like with experience on that hill, Pieter and Kelly can reach their potential.”
The team has had its shares of ups and downs with the weather and injuries afflicting the team as a whole. Thus, the alpine team has had to manage without some of its best skiers being able to compete.
With the Eastern Intercollegiate fast approaching, the whole team is geared up to make a run against top seeds including Vermont and Dartmouth. Looking ahead to the EISC Championship Carnival, City had a positive outlook on the team’s chances to compete against national powerhouses like the Catamounts and Big Green.
“It’s a long season, and this often catches up with us about this time of year, but I think we’re in good shape,” City said. It’ll be nice to have the rest week, but I think we’re in really good shape going into championships.”
With the regular season portion of its schedule now over, the Crimson heads off to the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association championship at St. Lawrence two weeks from now.

In what was arguably the most important competition before the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams welcomed Ancient Eight rivals Princeton and Yale to Cambridge for the annual H-Y-P meet on Saturday.
Both teams had success in their preview of Ivy League competition. The men and women each took second, with 36 and 54 points respectively, behind the champion Tigers, who took home the team titles in both events with 125 and 87 points, respectively.
The Elis finished third, with 22 points for the men and 41 for the women.
While the team was unable to claim the title at home, various individuals took home accolades led by sophomore Nikki Okwelogu, who continued her impressive campaign by breaking her own conference record in the shot put.
The Fresno, Calif., native threw a mark of 16.51 meters, 0.12 meters further than the previous record and two meters better than second-place Karleh Wilson from Yale.
Okwelogu wasn’t the only field athlete to take home the title, as classmate Joshua Whitener took home the title with an 18.41 meter mark in the weight throw, while rookie Floriaine Kameni took home the triple jump with an 11.7 meter leap.
“I was very surprised by the throw,” Okwelogu said. “I almost didn’t release it, [but] I then throw and then I look at it…. I was so shocked. I didn’t know it was a good throw.”
In addition to the three titles, there were various runner-up finishes earned by the Crimson. Junior Allison Morrison claimed a personal best in the long jump with a mark of 5.49 meters and classmate Raegan Nizdil claimed her runner-up finish with a jump of 1.70 meters.
Senior Taylor DuPont took second in the women’s weight throw with a mark of 16.8 meters, while on the men’s side, sophomore Efe Uwaifo claimed runner-up in his first meet of the year with a 15.36 meter triple jump mark.
Harvard’s success continued on the track, where the Crimson swept the top three spots in the women’s 60 meter hurdles, as junior Autumne Franklin won the event with a time of 8.61. Franklin was followed by sophomore Jackie Modesett and junior Madison Hansen.
The women’s 60 meter dash would prove to be fruitful as well, as senior Danielle Barbian’s 7.51 sprint won her the title, with classmate Ashely Collinsworth finishing just behind her at 7.60.
The sprinters’ success would continue as junior Christi Scott outran the competition from the start to claim the 200 meter title with a time of 24.89. The 4 x 440 yard relay team consisting of Scott, Franklin, Collinsworth and senior Gabrielle Scott would also be triumphant with a 3:45.92 finish.
The performances by the team drew praise from head coach Jason Saretsky, who believes that the team will be even better at Heps.
“We’ve got a lot of talented student-athletes that are ready to compete at a high level,” Saretsky said. “They know what it’s like to compete at that level and I feel confident we’ll be seeing a very different performance when we’re back at Gordon in two weeks.”
On the men’s side, junior Tom Purnell claimed the 3000 meter title with an 8:08.67 finish, while freshman Jonas Aranda would run a close 800 meter run, finishing in second place with a personal best, and Harvard all time-sixth best, 1:50.89 mark.
The rookie would close the gap between him and first place finisher Bradley Paternostro of Princeton in the last 100 meters as the crowd willed the two on, but would fall just short of overtaking him at the line, finishing a mere 0.11 seconds behind the Princeton athlete.
The distance honors continued as senior Connor Reck took second in the 1,000 meter run with a 2:30.13 finish, less than a second behind James Randon from Yale in another finish which came down to the wire.
Another runner-up finish would be attained in the 4 x 880 yard relay as senior Nephat Maratim, Arnada, Reck and senior Billy Looney would finish with a time of 7:40.75. Maritim would also take home a personal best in the mile with a time of 4:10.75.
Captain Jarvis Harris led the male sprinters with a third place finish in the 60 meter hurdles while freshman Ahmed Obed placed third in the 200 meter race.
While the team was able to have impressive performances throughout the weekend, Okwelogu believes that the team has the potential for an even better showing.
“We didn’t have the best showing as a team this past weekend,” Okwelogu said. “I just want everybody to do what I know they can do…I want to cheer on teammates and I know they can contribute.”
With the team not yet at full strength, there is reason to believe that the Crimson can improve greatly in the two weeks of preparation before hosting Heps on February 28th. A big part of this preparation will be the reaction the team has to HYP.
After being exposed to the level of talent that some of their Ivy League rivals have, the meet served as a wake-up call for Harvard and the response which the athletes give will go a long way in being able to claim the Ancient Eight title on both sides.
“This [was] definitely a good opportunity to see what happens if we’re not firing at full strength,” Saretsky said. “I know our student athletes are going to take this past weekend’s competitions and really focus on what we need to do to be in a better position come Heps.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One test down, many more to come. The Harvard men’s tennis team passed an important benchmark with flying colors this weekend in its buildup to its spring season, taking home the crown at the ECAC Division I Indoor Championship in Cambridge.
In its first real competition against its Ivy League foes this season, the Crimson showed its rivals that it will be a force to be reckoned with as it seeks to retake the Ancient Eight throne. Harvard captured back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013, and finished second last year.
The tournament field contained seven of eight Ivy League teams—notably missing was defending Ivy champion Columbia, which was competing in the ITA National Men’s Team Indoor Championship—as well as St. John’s, George Washington, and Monmouth.
This weekend, the Crimson lived up to its No. 1 seeding, dispatching Ancient Eight foes Yale and Princeton in the earlier rounds before easily handling second-seeded Dartmouth in Monday’s final.
“We knew that this would be a good task for us, considering that seven of eight Ivies were competing,” senior Shaun Chaudhuri said. “And we’re happy with the way we competed and learned from each match.”
HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 0
Monday’s final pitted the Ivy League’s second and third-place finishers from a year ago against each other. Furthermore, the Big Green, which took down St. John’s and Brown en route to the championship round, sought to avenge its 5-2 exhibition loss to Harvard in January.
The Crimson started off poorly in doubles, getting broken to open the matches on courts one and three. Co-captain Alex Steinroeder and freshman Grant Solomon eventually came out ahead in a back-and-forth match at No. 3, 6-3.
But when junior Nicky Hu and sophomore Sebastian Beltrame fell, 6-3, on the second court and with Dartmouth serving for the match at the top spot, the Big Green was poised to take the doubles point. But after coming within a single point, a double fault eventually led to a break for co-captain Denis Nguyen and sophomore Brian Yeung. The duo, ranked 15th nationally, eventually delivered the doubles point for Harvard in a tiebreak.
From there, the Crimson didn’t look back. Freshman Kenny Tao prevailed, 6-1, 6-4, and Steinroeder followed suit in straight sets a few minutes later to give Harvard the 3-0 lead.
And at No. 1, Nguyen cruised past Dartmouth’s Dovydas Sakinis, 6-2, 6-4, to make Harvard ECAC champions.
“Yesterday, we faced a tough Princeton team, and it was a close match,” Steinroeder said. “Today against Dartmouth, everyone came out firing, and we played much better overall.”
HARVARD 4, PRINCETON 2
On Sunday, the Crimson clinched a spot in the championship round with a 4-2 semifinal victory over the Tigers. Princeton was slow to start against Harvard and ultimately failed to recover.
Beltrame and Hu picked up a 6-4 win on the second court, and the doubles point fell to the tight contests at the other two spots. Solomon and Steinroeder went down on the third court, 6-4, but Nguyen and Yeung once again worked it to a tiebreak in the top slot.
From there, the duo cruised to a 7-0 win in the tiebreak, and the Crimson headed into singles with the doubles point.
“When guys weren’t playing well this weekend, they still showed a lot of poise,” Steinroeder said. “In doubles especially, Denis and Brian came out big to win doubles in a tiebreak, and that’s a big confidence boost going into singles.”
Princeton evened the match when Steinroeder went down quickly, 6-1, 6-1, but Hu countered with a 7-6(5), 6-3 win. When Beltrame followed with a three-set win a few minutes later, Harvard sat one point from victory. Solomon fell on the sixth court, but Nguyen’s comeback victory over the Tigers’ Zack McCourt, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, sent the Crimson to the final.
HARVARD 4, YALE 0
In Harvard’s first-round matchup, the Crimson provided rival Yale with a Valentine’s Day gift in the form of a 4-0 beatdown.
The Crimson gained the upper hand early, as Hu and Beltrame won, 6-4, and Nguyen and Yeung took their match in a tiebreak.
In singles, Solomon cruised to a 6-4, 6-0 win, and Chaudhuri gave Harvard the 3-0 advantage with a 6-4, 6-2 victory on court six.
Steinroeder clinched the win with a 6-4, 6-4 triumph on the third court, and the match was over—under two hours after it started.
While the squad was happy to pick up three wins over conference opponents, fifteenth-ranked Lions’ absence still stood out.
“We obviously are aware that Columbia wasn’t here,” Chaudhuri noted. “We continue to push each other and can pat ourselves on the back for a good weekend, but they remain a big threat.”
But the season is long, and for now, the Crimson has positioned itself well heading into matches against ranked opponents Minnesota and Vanderbilt this weekend.
“These are chances to see how we stack up nationally,” Steinroeder said. “We can see how we’re doing at the halfway point. If we can come away with wins, that’ll be really big.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finding itself in a near dead heat at the top of the ECAC women’s ice hockey standings, the No. 4/4 Harvard squad swept its final regular season road weekend to break through to the top of the league heading into the final stretch of the year.
The Crimson (21-4-2, 16-3-1 ECAC) took down Cornell, 4-1, and trounced Colgate, 5-0, to gain a three-point advantage on the conference leaderboard over second place teams Quinnipiac and Clarkson. Harvard will face Colgate and St. Lawrence this coming weekend—its final regular season pair at home—already having secured home ice at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center for the ECAC tournament at the end of the month.
“We want to finish the regular season with the kind of intensity and that focus we’ve gone about our business [with] for the majority of the year," Harvard coach Katey Stone said. "And certainly the second half [of the season]."
HARVARD 5, COLGATE 0
Crimson junior forward Miye D’Oench nabbed her third three-point performance of the season on Saturday, as Harvard blanked the Raiders (4-15-1, 7-24-1) to complete the weekend sweep. D’Oench’s pair of goals and one assist helped bring the Crimson winning streak to six games.
Meanwhile, Harvard’s defense remained steady as the Crimson killed three penalties, leaving opponents 0-for-8 on the power play this weekend and 0-for-16 over the past four games.
“I think our kids are doing a much better job of reading the power play—[knowing] when they can pressure and when they can be more strategic like they were against Boston College [on Feb. 10],” Stone said. “Your penalty kill starts with your goaltender too, but we’re also giving up very few shots on the opponent’s power play, which is huge for us.”
Following Harvard's first matchup with Colgate—a 6-1 Crimson victory—senior defenseman Josephine Pucci pointed to a balanced attack as the reason behind her team's success.
“[A] big thing is that we have a lot of depth,” said Pucci following the Jan. 24 contest. “That’s going to help us wear down teams.”
Co-captain Marissa Gedman and freshmen forwards Karly Heffernan and Haley Mullins helped reiterate that point, each scoring a goal apiece in the rematch, with Gedman’s coming on the power play.
Starting in her first game this season, Colgate goaltender Susan Allen yielded three goals during her 31 minutes in goal and was replaced by second stringer Brittney Brooks for the second half of the contest. Still, Harvard’s quick-moving offense created two goals against Brooks, while the Raiders were unable to string together any offensive momentum with just 18 shots on goal throughout the contest.
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 1
Coming off its win over No. 1/1 Boston College for the Beanpot title, the Crimson successfully converted championship energy into a victory over the Big Red (14-9-3, 12-5-2).
“That’s a really tough game to play right after a big win like that,” Stone said. “You turn around and have a huge game against Cornell up in their barn. I thought our kids handled it really well.”
While Cornell may have been first to score—senior forward Emily Fulton struck just two and a half minutes into the game, marking junior goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer’s only goal allowed all weekend—the Crimson controlled the ice throughout the game.
Sophomore forward Sydney Daniels chipped in two goals, one each in the first and second frames, to pace Harvard. Co-captain Samantha Reber scored while the Crimson was on the power play—its sole conversion over four tries—and junior forward Mary Parker drilled an empty netter in the last 30 seconds of the contest.
The Big Red was no match for Harvard, as they allowed 42 shots on goal while only mustering 24 of its own over 60 minutes of play. The win closes out Harvard’s slate of Ivy League games, having lost two—to Dartmouth and Princeton—and having won the other eight. En route to the victory victory, the Crimson killed five penalties to render Cornell powerless on the power play.
“It was a gritty win,” Stone said. “It wasn’t a pretty game necessarily. It was a defensive battle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week before the Ivy League Championships, a contingent of Harvard swimmers competed at the Ohio State Winter Invite this weekend, earning 11 top-three finishes against local Ohio teams including Toledo, Purdue, and Ball State.
The Crimson (7-1-1, 6-0-1 Ivy) was led by sophomore Maggie Chory, who put up Harvard’s only individual first place finishes of the weekend, topping the podium three times.  Chory’s 55.84 time gave her the victory in the 100 backstroke. She won the 200 back as well with a time of 2:00.17.
Chory also swam alongside sophomore Summer Schmitt, senior Sarah Sumner, and junior Marlee Ehrlich to earn gold in the 200 freestyle relay.  The same relay team swam to third place in the 400 free relay.
Schmitt’s success went beyond her relay finishes. The sophomore put up another top-three finish in the 100 butterfly. In addition, her 2:04.84 time in the 200 fly gave her fourth place, and she took fifth in the 200 back.
Ehrlich delivered individually as well, holding down the Crimson’s distance team. Finishing in 5:00.57, Ehrilch took second in the 500 free. Her 17:03.96 time was good for second in the 1650 free, while junior Daniela Suarez-Rebling took fourth in the same event.
More strong performances came from junior Shori Hijikata, who finished second and third in the 200 butterfly and 200 individual medley, respectively. She also took fourth in the 100 fly, behind Chory and Schmitt.
The lone senior representing Harvard did not disappoint either. Sumner took two top-three finishes individually, placing third in both the 100 and 200 free. Her 200 free time of 1:57.47 put her almost two seconds ahead of the fourth place finisher.
Sophomore Savannah Butler took care of the breaststroke events, taking third in the 100 breast and fourth in the 200 breast.
The seven Crimson swimmers returned to Cambridge Sunday, ready to join the team as it prepares for Ivies.

Dear Harvard College Students,
We continue to monitor the severe weather expected this coming week, and appreciate your patience and support in the face of curtailed services. Our dining hall staff across the houses, as you have experienced, have performed valiantly under constrained circumstances. That being said, tonight’s dinner entrée will be swai, and you’re going to like it. Tomorrow’s entrées will be swai. And you’re going to like it, again. We also will be serving oatmeal raisin cookies.
Given the limited amenities in the face of the impending apocalypse, I implore you to take the following precautionary measures:
-Consider severing ties with those who live in the Radcliffe Quadrangle.
-Attempt to socialize with those in your immediate proximity. If this proves simply too hard, consult Skype, Netflix, or a problem set of your preference.
-Buy a shovel.
-Avoid crying outside. Temperatures will remain below salt-water freezing point.
-Avoid clothing that exposes your midriff.
-Avoid being impaled by falling icicles. I have helpfully placed signs around the Yard to this extent.
-Quarantine those who have fallen ill.
-Wear socks.
I trust the level-headed amongst you have come to the realization that playing in the snow is a trite, juvenile activity. Such behavior is unbecoming of Harvard students, and evidence of such will result in disciplinary action by the Administrative Board.
Today, all services will resume College-wide. Libraries scheduled to open will do so as usual. However, shuttle services will be cancelled. The scheduling of many sporting events has also been changed, so please consult with our sporting venues about any last-minute rescheduling.
Be mindful, however, that travel with be both “impossible and life threatening,” according to the National Weather Service. Additionally, severe cold can cause walkways to be unusually slippery, so use caution when walking around campus.
May the odds be ever in your favor,
Stephen Lassonde
Dean of Student Life

8:30 a.m. – I wake up decidedly single. Blinking sleep from my bleary eyes, I realize that I am also completely bereft of plans for the day. And more shockingly: bereft of chocolate. One of these things is an immediate must-fix (it's the chocolate).
8:35 a.m. – The snooze blares its judgmental alarm at me and I roll out of bed. I'm a day by day kind of planner. Scratch that. Minute by minute. Scratch that too, my mom reads these. I plan things weeks in advance, don't worry mom. But my hypothetical lethargic alter-ego isn't really the type to calendar out meals in advance. Or anything to do with an afternoon. Or life. I figure I should at least spend some time with humans today, but who? And how to broach the subject without sounding needy? A few drafts of texts run through my head. “Hey (platonic) baby, wanna double date? Me and my 300 pages of reading due Tuesday, you and your Pset...?” Maybe not.
11:30 a.m. – I decide to brave brunch solo. Strapping on my heavy boots and my heavier book, I stride into the D-Hall, a manic I'll-sit-and-read-alone-if-I-have-to-holiday-be-damned look flitting across my eyes. I manage to form a squad with a few block-mates and conversation quickly turns to the day's hottest topic: Datamatch. Datamatch delightfully divides us between those who did and those who didn't. Aha, you have a loving relationship? What a shame, I get free waffles. We bask in our superiority.
12:30 p.m. – I learn that my roommate in a loving relationship actually did try his hand at Datamatch. I think his girlfriend jokingly suggested it, and unsure of whether or not that comment was serious he decided to hedge his bets and fill out the form. It backfired when he accidentally hit the waffles button as he was viewing the matches on his phone. I recommended he go. I'm fairly sure most of the dates are gonna be in it for that W anyways.
3:30 p.m. – With that girlfriend visiting for the weekend, another down from Canada (though she says she's “staying with another friend,” so fret not mom, we're quite responsible here), and a third having all but moved in for the semester, I've been upgrading from a tricycle to a pentacycle to a septacycle. I love them all dearly but at some point make the strategic decision to retreat into my room with my book-date in hand.
3:31 p.m. – As part of a not very well thought out prank, our floor has become littered with large balloons. They're like roommates: I have to be very careful not to step on them or they'll make a horrifically loud noise and annoy the whole floor. I've become quite close with the one who has a bearded lady sharpied on it. Don't tell the others though. They'll just get jealous.
3:32 p.m. – I'm curled up in bed reading but my heart isn't in it. Where is my heart? Who knows. If I was an autonomous blood pumping organ I'd be someplace a little warmer. Hawaii is where the heart is, I believe the old saying goes. I feel my eyelids droop. No stop, you nitwit! There's so much left to do today! I grumble and start to get up, but something makes me stop mid-cover-throw. A revelation.
It's so simple it's perfect. It's so insane I'm afraid to even try. It's so game changing, I don't even know if I should be letting it out. Somehow, I've stumbled blindly upon the secret to Valentine's Day.
I look to my roommates and they nod back in reassuring silence.
I'm dead asleep not two minutes later. Valentine's Day? Think I nailed it.
