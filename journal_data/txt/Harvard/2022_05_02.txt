After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Black Arts Collective, a new undergraduate organization dedicated to Black artistry at Harvard, showcased student performers at its inaugural mixer on Friday.
The event, held in the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, featured a conversation with Harvard English and African and African American Studies professor Tracy K. Smith ’94 — a United States Poet Laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner.
“It was a dream to have her present, and I’m glad that she came and spoke true words of wisdom,” said Toussaint J. Miller ’25, who helped organize the event.
The mixer, which drew more than 50 people, was the first event organized by Black Arts Collective. The new group is led by Miller, Mariah M. Norman ’25, Anya N. Sesay ’25, and Jetta M. Strayhorn ’25.
“It was amazing to have all of our student performers,” Miller said. “It shows how much of Black Harvard and people who support Black Harvard identifies as a community.”
“That’s why we’re called the Black Arts Collective — because we are a family,” Miller added.
Sesay called the mixer a “beautiful inaugural event.”
The student performers included Miller, who performed an original composition and called on the audience to harmonize with him, along with Sesay and Strayhorn, who recited poetry.
Devon N. Gates ’23 played bass and sang a rendition of Aretha Franklin’s “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” which the crowd joined in singing.
“Such great energy — great to be playing for people that you know have usually a similar musical upbringing,” Gates said. “They’re all songs that we all grew up singing and hearing in the car and in the house.”
Audience member Nia N. Meadows ’23-’24 described the event as “inspiring.”
“It feels like it could be a really transformative change,” Meadows said. “I’m just really excited to see where this could lead.”
Norman said audience members thanked her and the other organizers following the event.
“I could tell that we needed this — Black Harvard needed this, and Harvard needed this,” she added.
The organizers said they hope to hold more events and foster Black artistry at Harvard.
“It’s not something that’s going to end when we leave, at all. This will be a community that we will continue to build and foster,” Strayhorn said. “It’s not even about us at this point. It’s just about allowing Blackness to thrive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not just you: This year’s freshmen really are everywhere.
Over 1,900 students were accepted into Harvard College’s Class of 2025 back in 2021, joining the roughly 350 members of the Class of 2024 who chose to defer their acceptance a year prior. All in all, the Class of 2025 sits at about 1,962 – the College’s largest classes to date, and a true nightmare if you have to get past Annenberg to get to lecture.
Yet undergraduate punctuality is hardly the biggest victim of our outsized freshman class — first-year proctors, in many ways the keepers of our youngest affiliates, are.
First-year proctors are an integral part of the freshman experience at Harvard. Proctors, who must be enrolled in a Harvard graduate program or employed by the University, oversee freshmen entryways and are supposed to facilitate the sometimes rocky transition to collegiate life. In exchange for a variety of duties ranging from advising students to organizing study breaks, proctors receive free Harvard housing and a University meal plan.
The humongous class of freshmen has seemingly changed the expectations associated with the role, overwhelming proctors. Current first-year proctors have reported feeling burnt out; five felt compelled to leave their roles mid-year. Their responsibilities have quite literally multiplied: Rather than being assigned to advise the usual six to 12 freshmen as in prior years, this year’s proctors were given assignments of up to 18 students each. This over-burdening necessitates a vastly different time commitment than what they originally signed up for.
Harvard knew that the incoming class would be substantially larger as early as this summer. So why were first-year proctors forced to pick up the slack for our institution’s poor planning?
Needless to say, the fact that first-year proctors' only form of payment is University housing and meals makes it very easy to exploit their labor, making pay increases exceedingly unlikely (who, after all, wants an extra dining-hall swipe?). Particularly in light of their somewhat-fixed payment regime, it is unfair to hold our freshmen proctors to higher standards and more substantial workloads than what they originally expected. ‘Proctoring’ is not a full-time job, nor is it supposed to be — our freshman tutors should have the breathing room to pursue their actual studies or careers unencumbered by unexpected, unpaid extra work.
We want to make one thing clear: This is a labor issue, a labor trend even. Time and time again, when push comes to shove and Harvard faces economic difficulty, it is those with the least institutional power that must pick up the slack. This systematic undervaluing of lower-paid, less “prestigious” labor is unjust and wide-ranging. It’s by no means the first time that Harvard has failed to treat its workers fairly.
The proctor debacle thus reflects more than Harvard’s slant towards austerity politics throughout Covid-19, subtly cutting corners while tacitly accepting post-pandemic understaffing as a ‘new normal.’ Either the administration believes that advising 12 students entails the same amount of work as advising 18, or it refuses to compensate for the additional work adequately; neither offers a satisfactory answer. It’s emblematic of what can only be described as institutional indifference towards proctoring itself, a baffling confidence that unpaid, regrettably not-unionized workers can simply be expected to ‘chip in’ and alleviate the direct consequences of understaffing our billionaire institution.
One might expect our College, in the face of such a sharp rise in proctor departures and reported stress levels, to be willing to introspect in the same good faith it demands from its proctors. Instead, it’s become clear that both Harvard and the First-Year Experience Office have, at times,  created anxiety-inducing environments where proctors have been afraid to speak out. If internal critiques are unlikely, external scrutiny is aggressively discouraged. When our fellow Crimson news editors began working on their reporting, Nekesa C. Straker, a senior assistant dean who oversees the FYE, instructed proctors that they could “feel free to ignore” the Crimson’s inquiries about their experiences and requested to be notified of any prior exchanges.
Speaking with student journalists, Straker sternly argued, rarely goes “the way one hopes it will”.
We strenuously reject the way the Crimson was characterized by Dean Straker, and find the notion that student reporting — not sexual harassment, unworthy investments, or even lackluster proctoring — is the issue alarming. If anything, we find the improper intimidation of unpaid workers seeking adequate redress through the press symptomatic of Harvard’s excessive fixation on public perceptions over substance. All Harvard employees, including proctors, should be able to share their perspectives with media outlets without fear of institutional retaliation — especially when our institution is failing them on almost every level.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was looking through courses this semester, I noticed that the professor of a class about narratives of individuals who were enslaved was a white man. That didn’t sit right with me. Why would a class about stories integral to Black culture be taught by someone with no lived experience in that culture?
I’ll back up a little bit. As a straight, cisgender, white man from an upper-middle-class family, I come from an awful lot of privilege. I know how easy it is to unintentionally overlook bigotry because it doesn’t constantly exert a force on my life. I’ve felt the effects of discrimination through my friends and my mom, who works as a lawyer, while my dad stays home — but that’s not remotely the same. And as someone with not just one, but many forms of privilege, I haven’t had any experience with oppression that might help me empathize with others’ struggles. I simply have no rubric.
This lack of lived experience means I have to be careful when talking about injustice. I can, and should, educate myself on the topic — oppressed people shouldn’t bear the sole responsibility of teaching others about their trauma. But there’s a difference between forcing the burden of education on victims and understanding that a story rooted in group history and experience can only be truly told by someone within that group.
So regardless of how qualified white professors are, I really don’t think they should be teaching classes explicitly focused on the experiences of other racial or ethnic groups. Of course, these topics need to be taught, and at a less-well-funded school, a white teacher might be the only person available. But Harvard has the resources to hire whomever they like, so it’s concerning that 79 percent of tenured professors are white, 57 percent are white men, and only 4 percent are Black. Yale and Princeton, among others, have similar demographics, but that should not be used to diffuse responsibility. Something is deeply broken.
Harvard should hire more minority faculty in every department — diverse scholars shouldn’t be pigeonholed into studying only their own cultural history. But in fields focused on group culture, there’s no excuse for underrepresentation. While there are certainly esteemed Black professors in the Department of African and African American Studies, there are not nearly enough. And that’s not for lack of demand — students have been pushing for an expanded ethnic studies program for years.
Why such reticence to make meaningful change? One reason is that this change requires privileged individuals to fight against their own privilege. And that’s hard, because privilege offers a powerful feeling of superiority — a feeling strong enough to cause people to sometimes betray solidarity even when it would be in their economic interest. Poor white Southerners, for instance, refused to join Black sharecroppers after the Civil War to fight the plantation aristocracy, because they didn’t want to let go of the emotional safety net of white supremacy. Fear of ostracization offers another impetus to stay silent — for example, men who stand up for women’s rights are often attacked by other men. And hearing marginalized people speak up can feel like injustice for those accustomed to their stories being the only ones told. That’s why white racists scream “reverse racism,” and transphobes cry for the rights of the “super-straights.”
Whether I like it or not, my privilege gives me a platform, and I have a responsibility to use it, because silence promotes the status quo. As I understand it, I should amplify others’ stories, express my opposition to discrimination, and share my experience when appropriate. It’s a cop-out to argue that I shouldn’t say anything because my perspective isn’t as relevant as the one of the person who’s experiencing discrimination; telling my story isn’t mutually exclusive with listening as long as I’m respectful. I just need to make sure I stay open to constructive criticism — I have no experience with the other side of the power dynamic, so criticism could easily be rightful.
Of course, being an ally does not absolve me of privilege — I know that I’m still capable of accidentally hurting people, and judgment for going against the grain is not the same as being seen as subhuman. I’m also aware that I shouldn’t congratulate myself for standing up — applauding allies for decrying bigotry, while not doing the same for marginalized people, is itself a subtle form of discrimination. I shouldn’t be rewarded twice as much for working half as hard.
I’m sure the white professors teaching about Black history are knowledgeable. But that doesn’t mean they should be the ones teaching those classes. As someone who’s never faced discrimination, I ask those in my position to understand our shared lack of experience, and therefore to be more cognizant of when to talk and when to shut up — even when it’s easy to keep talking. Because the only people who can truly understand prejudice are those who have been on the wrong side of it.
There are many things I can and should do with the platform my privilege affords me. Telling someone else’s story for them is not one of those things.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In every generation, they rise against us to destroy us,” Jewish students sang in the Vehi SheAmda prayer at Friday and Saturday night’s Passover seders. The passage first appeared in the Passover liturgy in the 8th century, and it still rings true. They did and still do rise against us.
They rose against us to destroy us during years of our people’s enslavement and backbreaking labor in Egypt, which we commemorate and relive during the Passover seder. They rose against us during centuries of inquisitions, expulsions, pogroms, and blood libels. Passover, in particular, was a time of fear for Jews throughout Medieval times. During this holiday time, gentiles raised baseless accusations against Jews, claiming that they murdered gentile children and used their blood for Passover rituals. These accusations exploded on an annual basis into pogroms, murder sprees that kept Jews reciting, millennia after their Exodus, “This year we are slaves, next year we will be free people.”
American Jews continue to face the seemingly eternal virus of antisemitism. In 2021, one in four Jews experienced antisemitism and there was a 12 percent increase in antisemitic acts such as vandalism, harassment, and assault. This Passover, our campus has witnessed antisemitism and callous disregard of Jewish students.
As students observing Passover returned from joyous celebrations, they were disturbed to enter Harvard Yard and see a large display resembling Holocaust imagery of planes, barbed wire fences, and boxcars, including bandying insults against Zionists, equating their belief in a homeland for the Jewish people with systematic oppressions as stark as racism and homophobia.
Passover tells the history of the Jewish people bravely uniting to break from the oppressive bonds of slavery. To host Israel Apartheid Week during Passover diminishes the experience of Jewish suffering and cries for Jewish safety because Israel Apartheid Week opposes the existence of the State of Israel and claims that Jewish people are racist oppressors.
By inviting known Holocaust denial apologist, Norman Finkelstein to campus, the Palestinian Solidarity Committee created a hostile environment for Jewish students. Finklestein is the author of ‘The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering.” This book evokes the antisemitic stereotype that Jews are greedy, manipulative, and power-hungry, by implying that Jews benefit financially from the Third Reich’s genocide of the Jewish people. Beyond that, Finkelstein has praised Holocaust denier David Irving, and terrorist groups such as Hezbollah.
The Apartheid wall, prominently featured on campus,  declares that “Zionism is racism, settler colonialism, white supremacy, apartheid.” It includes graphics triggering for many Jewish students, cartoon depictions of a wired fence, World War II-style airplanes, and boxcar trains — images that call to mind a Nazi concentration camp. Additionally, when the great majority of Jews in Israel are Sephardi, Mizrachi, African, or of mixed Ethnicity, whitewashing Zionism as “white supremacy” is also inherently antisemitic.
The Anti-Defamation League defines Zionism as the Jewish movement for self-determination in the land of Israel — the historical birthplace and biblical homeland of the Jewish people. With this in mind, Zionism, manifested as the desire to return to the Land of Israel, has been at the heart of Judaism since the Jewish peoples were forced, oppressed, and exiled from their ethnic homeland two thousand years ago. Such Zionism is embedded in Jewish prayer, ritual, literature, and culture, and in turn, Pew Research Center reports that 45 percent of Jews say caring about Israel is “essential” to their Jewish identity, and an additional 37 percent say it is “important” to their Jewish identity. When the overwhelming majority of Jewish people identify as Zionist, to dismiss this ideology is culturally and historically insensitive and antisemitic.
Jewish individuals have been active participants in civil rights, gender equality, fair labor, and queer liberation movements all throughout American history. Jewish students work to promote the ideal of  Tzelem Elohim, that all people have a divine spark in them and have equal dignity and value, and Tikkun Olam, world repair. To label a significant portion of Jewish students racist and colonial for following their religious values is antisemitic and disheartening.
Witnessing how people rise against Jewish communities in this generation has been a burden for many Jewish students, but they will remember the first verse of the Vehi Sheamda prayer:  “It is this that has stood for our ancestors and for us,” this meaning the promise that God made to Abraham, that our ancestors would be redeemed from Egypt and make it safely to the biblical Land of Israel. It is this promise of a national homeland that we proudly sing at the end of the seder, “Next Year in Jerusalem.”

A recent study published by Harvard affiliated-researchers in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found infertility in women to be linked with a 16 percent increase in risk of heart failure.
The study — conducted by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital with support from the American Heart Association and the National Institute of Health — analyzed data from more than 35,000 post-menopausal women.
The researchers found a statistically significant link between history of infertility and risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF, however no such link was found between infertility and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, HFrEF.
Though HFpEF and HFrEF are both forms of heart failure, HFpEF differs from HFrEF in the amount of blood pumped from the left ventricle of the heart per beat, or the ejection fraction. The difference in ejection fraction lends itself to a difference in risk factors and mortality rates.
Emily S. Lau, an instructor at Harvard Medical School who was the study’s first author, said researchers don’t understand why HFpEF “is incredibly prevalent among women,” adding that “we don't have good therapies for that type of heart failure.”
Lau said there is “a big black box” around infertility research, even though national estimates show that roughly 15 percent of American women experience infertility.
Researchers have done some work in the past that showed a link between infertility and cardiovascular disease, according to Lau. Before the new study was published in JACC, however, Lau said “the investigations had been very small in scale, and the data really had been quite mixed.”
“There’s a lot of room for investigation,” Lau said. “Trying to connect a woman’s reproductive history with her future risk of cardiovascular disease — specifically with this form of heart failure — is really important to me, and, I think, something that will guide clinical practice for many cardiologists and primary care physicians.”
“We, actually, as a medical community need to be asking our women patients about their reproductive histories in a systematic way,” Lau added.
Lau said she and other researchers are interested in understanding the mechanisms driving the link between infertility and risk of heart disease.
“I think we have a lot of room to go in terms of better understanding this relationship,” Lau said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the release of a long-awaited report that detailed the “integral” role slavery played in shaping Harvard, University President Lawrence S. Bacow on Friday pledged to marshal the school’s resources to “repair the damage” caused by the legacy of slavery.
Bacow’s remarks came at a day-long event held at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study that was dedicated to discussing a landmark University report released last week that detailed how slavery “powerfully shaped Harvard.”
Harvard has pledged to allocate $100 million to implement the recommendations of the report, which found that prominent University affiliates enslaved more than 70 people and that slavery was a key source of the school’s wealth across three centuries.
“The reality is that slavery played a significant role in our institutional history,” Bacow said. “That this truth has been obscured for so long should prompt our indignation — and it does — but, more importantly, it must also prompt our action.”
The event, entitled “Telling the Truth about All This: Reckoning with Slavery and Its Legacies at Harvard and Beyond,” featured addresses from Bacow, Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Radcliffe Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin, Prairie View A&M University President Ruth J. Simmons, and Boston University Center for Antiracist Research Director Ibram X. Kendi, among others.
Speakers at the event came discussed the report’s findings and its significance for higher education.
Brown-Nagin, who chaired the committee that produced the report, opened the conference by discussing the importance of understanding historical injustices in the present day.
“As I’ve often said over the course of Harvard’s reckoning with its legacies of slavery, we can’t dismantle what we cannot understand,” she said. “We can’t understand contemporary injustice unless we reckon with our history, and we’re doing just that at Harvard.”
In his speech, Bacow, who formed the Presidential Committee on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery in 2019, recognized the findings of the report and acknowledged that the University has overlooked negative aspects of its history in the past.
“With nearly 400 years behind us, we could be — and in some cases have been — seduced by, let’s face it, a rosy view of our own history, a highly selective view of our own history,” Bacow said. “A view of our history where we tend to privilege virtue — virtue that makes us feel good about who we are and what we’ve done.”
“I have to confess that I have been guilty of this myself at times,” he added, reflecting on his relationship with the history of Elmwood, the Harvard president’s residence, where enslaved people once worked.
Simmons — who served as president of Brown from 2001-2012, becoming the first African American leader of an Ivy League school — delivered the event’s morning keynote address, alongside Garber and Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.
While serving as president of Brown, Simmons established a committee that examined the school’s ties to slavery. Bacow said Friday that Simmons “really paved the path for many others,” adding: “I’m sorry that it took some of us as long as it has to follow the road.”
In her keynote address, Simmons discussed how her experiences as a Black woman in academia shaped her actions as a leader in higher education.
“For all the lies that surrounded me, I knew there were places dedicated to truth. And so my flight to academic life was really all about looking for that space, somewhere in the world, where the truth can be told,” Simmons said. “So we designed a process, to try to find out what the truth of it was, because nobody seemed to know. It was all hidden. It was erased from books completely.”
“Insight from history is undeniably critical to solving current problems and preventing future abuses,” Simmons added.

Harvard’s campus is replete with the names of prominent historical figures who were essential to the development of the University and Massachusetts. These individuals and their generational legacies are honored through plaques, professorships, buildings, and streets that form the face of Harvard.
But many last names familiar to any Harvard student are also associated with a darker legacy.
A landmark University report released last week found that at least 41 prominent Harvard affiliates enslaved Black and Indigenous people — and many others propagated discrimination and racism through their leadership and scholarship at the University.
The report, produced by the University’s Presidential Commission on the Legacy of Slavery, identified more than 70 Black and Indigenous people enslaved by Harvard faculty, staff, and leaders — some of whom lived and worked on campus. Its appendix included a list of known slave owners, detailing how they are memorialized on campus.
Here are the houses, dormitories, professorships, streets, and towns that memorialize the legacy of slavery and discrimination at Harvard.
Harvard’s residential housing system is a quintessential part of the undergraduate experience. Upperclassman students at the College often introduce themselves to peers with their name, class year, and house affiliation. When they do, just shy of half of them identify last names associated with legacies of slavery, racism, or discrimination.
Governor John Winthrop, a founding member of Harvard who served on the University’s second-highest governing body, enslaved at least seven individuals and ordered for 17 prisoners from the Pequot War to be sold as slaves in Bermuda. Foundational to the development of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, he served multiple terms as its governor and lieutenant governor.
Winthrop House, an upperclassman residence, is dedicated to Winthrop and his descendent, also named John Winthrop.
Winthrop, the governor’s descendent, owned two slaves known as George and Scipio. He served as a professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy from 1738 to 1779 and as acting president of Harvard for a year.
Mather House, another one of Harvard’s 12 residential houses, is named after Increase and Cotton Mather, who both owned slaves — identified as “The Spaniard,” Onesimus, Obadiah, and “a little boy” in the report’s appendix.
Graduating from the College in 1656, Increase Mather later served as Harvard’s president and rector. His son, Cotton Mather, was a member of Harvard’s top governing boards, serving first on the Harvard Corporation and then the Board of Overseers.
In 2020, four Mather House residents wrote a petition calling on Harvard to change the House’s name in light of the family’s ties to slavery that garnered more than 300 signatures. Though they acknowledged the Mathers’ slave-ownership, then-Faculty Deans Michael D. Rosengarten and Christie McDonald said there were no plans to change the house’s name.
Leverett House and the Dudley Community are named after the relatives of Harvard affiliates who owned slaves. Leverett House honors the grandson of Governor John Leverett, who authorized the capture, enslavement, and forced migration of hundreds of Indigenous people during King Philip's War.
The Dudley Community, an alternative to the traditional house system, commemorates Thomas Dudley, a Massachusetts Bay Colony governor and member of the Harvard Corporation. Dudley’s son and grandson, Joseph and Paul Dudley, sat on University governing boards and owned slaves known as Peter, Brill, Guinea, an unnamed “Indian” girl, and an unnamed “negro boy.”
In emailed statements, faculty and resident deans of Winthrop House, Mather House, and the Dudley Community all acknowledged the report’s findings and pledged to facilitate further discussion.
The namesakes of Lowell House and Eliot House — Abbott Lawrence Lowell and Charles W. Eliot — are two University presidents who oversaw Harvard’s expansion in the 20th century. While neither enslaved people, both endorsed racist practices on campus.
Lowell, famous for creating the residential house system, excluded Black students from living in the new houses, promoted anti-Semitic admissions policies, and supported eugenics. He also amassed his wealth through the textile manufacturing industry, which relied on slave-picked cotton.
As Harvard’s longest-serving president, Eliot had a “paradoxical racial legacy,” according to the report. While Harvard produced its first Black graduates during his tenure, Eliot also promoted eugenics and racial segregation.
The heart of the University, Harvard Yard — which draws thousands of tourists each month — is home to several memorials honoring enslavers and their relatives.
Wadsworth House, which sits on the edge of the Yard facing Massachusetts Ave., was built in 1726 for its namesake Benjamin Wadsworth, a president of the University who enslaved two people. The gate near the building is also named after Wadsworth.
In 2016, former University President Drew G. Faust, joined by former Congressman John R. Lewis, dedicated a plaque on Wadsworth House to four enslaved people who lived and worked on campus in the 18th century: Bilhah, Venus, Titus, and Juba.
Farther down Massachusetts Avenue, brass markers memorialize the site of Nathaniel Eaton’s home. Eaton — Harvard’s first leader who served as schoolmaster in the 1630s — enslaved one individual, identified only as “The Moor.”
Wigglesworth Hall, a freshman dormitory located in Harvard Yard, was built on the site of the home of slave owner Edward Wigglesworth. A professor of Divinity and fellow of the Corporation, Wigglesworth enslaved a man known as Hannibal. The dormitory is named after his father.
Israel Stoughton oversaw the enslavement of hundreds of Pequot tribe members, per the report. He also enslaved an “Unnamed Pequot Woman” as well as a woman known as Dorcas. Stoughton Hall, another freshman dormitory, is named after his son.
Harvard’s endowed professorships are named in honor of prominent donors — including some with ties to slavery.
A professorship in orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School is named after a descendent of Israel Thorndike, a donor to the Massachusetts General Hospital who traded slaves in the Caribbean. James Perkins, another donor to the Harvard-affiliated MGH, traded slaves in Haiti and is the namesake for the Perkins Professorship of Astronomy and Mathematics.
Thomas Hancock, the namesake of the Hancock Professorship of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages, owned an unknown number of slaves, one of whom was called Cato.
Isaac Royall Jr. funded the first professorship in law at Harvard, the Royal Professorship of Law. Alongside his father, he owned more than 60 enslaved individuals in Massachusetts and enslaved an unknown number of individuals on a plantation in Antigua.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 announced in an email to affiliates following the release of the report that the professorship “will now be retired and will never be occupied again.” Professor Janet E. Halley, who held the post for more than a decade, resigned from the role, Manning wrote.
Other slave-owning Harvard affiliates played a role in shaping the school’s history — though changes to campus have altered or removed some of their traces.
For roughly two centuries, the seal of the Harvard Law School featured the Royall family crest. The Corporation allowed the school to change the seal in 2016 following student outcry.
The Perkins conference room in Massachusetts Hall — home to the Harvard president’s office — honors a descendent of MGH founding donor Samuel Gardner Perkins, who traded slaves in Haiti.
For over a century, Francis Foxcroft’s house stood on the corner of Kirkland and Oxford Streets before it was demolished to build Lowell Lecture Hall. Foxcroft was a member of the Board of Overseers who enslaved two people.
Jonathan Hastings, who enslaved at least four people, was a steward for the College, in charge of managing the school’s residential operations. A stone tablet next to the Littauer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School marks the site of his home, per the report.
Andrew Bordman II served as a steward and cook for the College from 1703 to 1747 and enslaved at least eight individuals. Enslaved people lived and worked at the Bordman home until Harvard bought the site in 1794. The Smith Campus Center now sits where the house was located.
Former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Thomas Oliver enslaved at least a dozen individuals. Oliver built Elmwood — the residence of Harvard presidents since the 1970s — and sat on the Board of Overseers. The report recovered the names of at least 11 people enslaved by Oliver and noted he also enslaved an unknown number of people in Antigua.
Several streets in Cambridge are named for families and Harvard affiliates with ties to slavery, including Holyoke, Willard, and Trowbridge Streets.
Edward Holyoke, who served as Harvard president from 1737 to 1769 and for whom Holyoke Street is named, enslaved four individuals. Joseph Willard, named Harvard president in 1781, enslaved a man named Cesar. Edmund Trowbridge, a professor and tutor, enslaved three people.
Brattle Street and Brattle Square are both named for the family of William Brattle. A tutor, fellow of the Harvard Corporation, and treasurer of the University, Brattle owned two slaves — Scipio and Cicely.
The town of Hopkinton, Mass., is named after Edward Hopkins, who provided significant financial support to Harvard in the early 18th century, and Winthrop, Mass., is named after Governor Winthrop and his family.
The report also identified 11 other Harvard administrators, faculty members, and major donors who enslaved people but are not memorialized on campus.

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the Hancock Professorship of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages is a position at the Harvard Divinity School. In fact, it is a Faculty of Arts and Sciences professorship.

Final Exams: You’re in for an intense, yet short and sweet rollercoaster ride
Huong T. Le
With a final exam, there is no need to schedule 50 different Calendlys with your TF to discuss your thought process. You have three hours and JUST three hours. As an exam-taker, you only have to memorize a semester’s worth of class material and dump it out on paper, and when you hand in that thicc stack of papers with your name and Harvard ID on every page, YOU’RE DONE! No proofreading, no citations, no cutting back on words to fit the limits. Out of sight, out of mind!
It’s pretty amazing to take a three-hour final exam in one sitting. As your hands are writing like a typing machine, your brain is synthesizing ALL the information you have accumulated since the beginning of the semester. Pretty impressive work for running on two+ shots of espresso and three hours of sleep. You should be proud of yourself, because we are!
Meanwhile, remember grinding a final paper you put off ’til the last day? You can spend hours in the liminal space of Lamont, looking at a blank document, waiting for the ideas to miraculously come to you. Sometimes it can also feel like you have too many options to choose from and suddenly your inability to make a decision is stopping you from writing anything. Plus, essays can be extremely hard impossible to write if you haven’t done the readings because suddenly you’re expected to synthesize and write a complex analysis of material that you haven’t looked at after skimming the syllabus in January.
Final exams, on the other hand, are the golden ground to flex your BS ability. You don’t need to put in polished sentences with advanced vocabulary to impress your TF, who is already bored grading hundreds of other papers. You can keep your answers short and sweet. As my friends throw me sympathetic looks for studying so hard for my upcoming final exams, I sympathize with them for having three humanities papers looming over their heads. I hope they find the time in between the endless formals to complete their 300-page readings. For me, I just can't wait until the moment I walk out of that big lecture hall, leaving my exam and class behind that door forever.
Final Papers: It’s always better when it’s on my terms.
Abigail Mejia
Final papers are the more merciful enemy because they let you go down your way. There’s no three-hour limit and you can go at your own pace. Without the time limit, you don’t get that horrible rush of anxiety in exams where you are second guessing all of your answers every time someone gets up to turn their exam in (gotta love imposter syndrome). Plus you can have someone look over your work and help you before you turn it in, but in exams that would be “academic dishonesty” or whatever.
Not only can you do papers on your own timeline, but you also get to write them in whatever environment you’d like. The crusty ambiance of Lamont at 3 a.m.? The dark academia aesthetic of Widener? The cozy comfort of your own bedroom? The choice is yours. No need to be trapped in a tiny little desk for three hours in a lecture hall, with your posture looking more like a shrimp every minute.
Another great thing about final papers is that you don’t have to memorize stuff. Imagine this: you’re in the middle of an exam and you vaguely remember the page the answer is on. What was on the right corner of page 312? You can almost picture it, but then it disappears like a mirage, leaving just frustration behind. With a paper, you can go back and look at the material whenever you need.
One of the best things about essays is that there’s (usually) so much more creative freedom. We Live in A Society and this is one of the few times where you can choose to follow your dreams (!!) and write about what you want since there’s rarely only one correct answer.
