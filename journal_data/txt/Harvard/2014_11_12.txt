After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having directed, produced, written, and scored nearly 40 beloved B-movies, including “The Thing” and “Escape from New York,” prolific quadruple-threat John Carpenter has easily established himself as one of Hollywood’s hardest-working men. It should come as no surprise, then, that at the ripe age of 66 the virtuoso continues to expand his horizons. In February, Carpenter will release his hotly anticipated debut album, “Lost Themes,” a collection of the director’s material from undeveloped films and the his own studio dabblings. The album’s opener and lead single, “Vortex,” is a foreboding jaunt that fits perfectly with Carpenter’s esteemed repertoire.
Weaving punctuated, haunting chords into layers of percolating synthesizers, the track is quintessentially Carpenter: brooding, atmospheric, and completely exhilarating. Like the composer’s other thematic scores, “Vortex” is purely instrumental. However, its combination of a steady crescendo, ominous piano trudge, and tendency to unsettle conveys a message just as well as lyrics would, proving that Carpenter’s innate storytelling abilities extend past a purely visual medium.
When discussing his upcoming album, Carpenter noted that “it can be both great and bad to score over images.... Here there were no pressures.” Because Carpenter’s previous musical work is so iconic, listeners can’t help but associate his songs with their respective films—the first few seconds of the “Halloween” theme immediately conjure up images of a knife-wielding, unyielding Michael Myers, for example. But the inherent appeal of “Vortex,” and presumably “Lost Themes” as a whole, is that there are no visual constraints. Whether it’s a dark and stormy night or a post-apocalyptic nightmare, Carpenter’s latest single provides his audience with the freedom to dream up its own adventure.
“Lost Themes” is out Feb. 3 via Sacred Bones.

“The Endless River,” Pink Floyd’s first studio album in 20 years, harkens back to the band’s classic sound of the ’60s and ’70s but mellowed out by time and age. The album is intended to be a belated homage to keyboardist Richard Wright, who died of cancer in 2008. It is a resurrection of tracks from their recording sessions for their 1994 album, “The Division Bell,” the last time David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason would record together. “The Endless River” continues the synthesizer-laden, slowed-down aesthetic of “The Division Bell,” but while “The Division Bell” was uninspired in its melodies, the sole focus of “The Endless River” is instrumental exploration: it contains 17 purely instrumental tracks and only one with vocals, which lends it much less of a classic rock feel and more of an ambient musicality. Though it lacks the energy of Pink Floyd’s earlier music, this languidness is perfectly suited to the band’s instrumental endeavor.
“The Endless River” is a continuous ebb of fluid, dream-like music. Most of the tracks are lightly strung-together notes with barely a melody, and the 18 short tracks, some barely a minute long, seamlessly flow into each other. The album’s ethereal quality is a product of a drawn-out synthesizer and reverberating electric guitar. “Things Left Unsaid…” begins with a vibrating, celestial swoosh of a synthesizer over muffled speaking voices, which builds up into a wavering, slow melody on the electric guitar. The next track, “It’s What We Do,” begins on the dying notes of the first melody, creating an effective transition between the two tracks, yet builds intensity with a steady beat of a drum in the background and the soaring notes of an electric guitar that add power to the song. The only track with vocals comes as a climax at the end of the album. “Louder Than Words” is one of the only songs on the album with an easy-to-follow tune. A choir of voices joins David Gilmour in an uplifting chorus against the background of a piano played with more energy at this culmination of the album than previously heard before. An electric guitar gains momentum and takes over at the end of the track, finishing the album on a reverberating last note.
Richard Wright’s influence as a keyboardist is certainly present on the album. Piano and organ are prominent instruments on several tracks, lending themselves to unique instrumental combinations. On “The Lost Art of Conversation,” the piano makes up a classical melody superimposed on the space-age background of a synthesizer. In “Autumn ’68,” the organ is the most prominent instrument of the track, giving it the feel of a soundtrack from an epic movie. Its range spans over high and low notes, with the unusual addition of an electric guitar adding flourishes towards the end. The wave-like crashing of the synthesizer adds intensity to certain points throughout the song. In “Calling,” however, Wright’s work on the piano is barely there, but provides a foreboding drumming of repeated low notes in the background, as a shimmering synthesizer plays a slow minor melody that forms the body of the song.
Though “The Endless River” is much more subdued than Pink Floyd’s previous albums and lacks a vocal dimension, the instrumentation speaks for itself and contains the same power as their music has traditionally held. Pink Floyd has found a way to be interesting even without vocals and lyrics, and this has allowed them more freedom to experiment through instrumentalization. “The Endless River” contains no memorable tracks or easily remembered melodies, but the album is really more about the serene mood it has managed to create. Its easily flowing, hard-to-distinguish transition between tracks is conducive to the album’s cohesion as a whole, mimicking the fluid motion of its namesake.

As I step back from a semester of writing on the issues surrounding models in the fashion industry, it strikes me that many of the topics I’ve covered—body image and plus-size modeling in particular, but race as well to a degree—center primarily around the discussion of female models. But what of the male model? Do they face the same kinds of problems as women, the same restrictions on race and size?
Statistics on the racial makeup of the male modeling industry are hard to come by, but an informal survey of Models.com’s top 50 male models presents us with six black models and four Asian models. It’s a substantial fraction, comparable to the five black female models and six Asian female models among the female top 50, and one that would have been unimaginable several years ago—but as is true for female models, tokenism within male modeling is still at play. “I can count on one hand the number of times when, if it hasn’t been a BET [Black Entertainment Television] fashion show or a ‘black’ fashion show, that there’s been more than one black male model on the shoot,” said Brent Zachery, a well-known black model, in an interview with The Washington Post.
Body image presents less of an issue. Male models’ bodies tend to fall into two categories: slender and muscular, with the former dominating the runway and the latter appearing more frequently in editorials and ad campaigns (which consequently makes them of greater influence to their male audience). The ubiquity of perfectly toned male models in Calvin Klein underwear ads and similar campaigns certainly influences men to attain a more muscular physique, according to a study cited by the Sex Information and Education Council of Canada. But the difference between this driving force toward muscularity and the parallel desire in women to achieve the slender figures of female models is that the degree to which male models are muscular is not inherently unhealthy, while the degree to which female models are thin is.
Are there male models that fall outside of this ideal—that is, is there a male counterpart to the female plus-size model? For now, it appears, the answer is no. “Women’s ‘plus-size’ is based on the fact that curves can be sexy,” wrote Wilhelmina Models booking agent Greg Chan in an email to New York Magazine. “The equivalent of curves on a man is a beer gut and love handles, and that’s not sexy.”
In lieu of the male plus-size model is instead a small market of big and tall models: men who are essentially taller, beefier versions of regular male models. But while female plus-size models, at size 12, don’t necessarily fit our definition of “true” plus-size, they are built similarly to the average American woman (at size 14) and thus provide some degree of representation of the everywoman’s body in the fashion industry. Men, on the other hand, have no equivalent. The male modeling industry is comprised of skinny men (runway models), buff men (editorial models), and buffer men (big and tall models), with no gray area in between for an average man—and the ensuing pressure for men to diet or train until they fall under one of these three body types, while perhaps not as medically dangerous or prevalent as the female compulsion to be thin, still serves as a mental and physical burden that could be alleviated were there a greater presence of average-figured men in editorials and on the runway.
What it comes down to, as it always does, is the obligation that those exposed to images of these models, as well as the models themselves, feel to conform to a certain look, whether that standard refers to skin color, body type, or gender. There continues to be an overwhelming and seemingly intentional lack of diversity on the runway with regard to any type of distinguishing physical attribute: Calvin Klein’s Fall 2013 Menswear show, for example, featured an army of men with the same translucently pale skin and straight, side-parted brown hair (supplemented with one black and two Asian models—thanks for the diversity, CK!), all garbed in head-to-toe black and gray. Such a choice on the part of the designer and the casting director is understandable—to standardize the models is to draw less attention to each individual and is in some ways analogous to creating a unified color palette for the collection—but the aesthetic that they do choose to represent their entire collection is internalized as the beauty ideal in the minds of their viewers.
We should know better—but we don’t. So while designers have a responsibility to their craft, their art, they also have a responsibility to the people, to ensure that those who bear witness to their work don’t go to extremes in the attempt to attain an impossible ideal that can never be reached.

My face burned. A pebble flew off the road and cracked against the windshield. The sound lingered in my ears, a high whine that distanced Sarah, who was saying, “I trust you, Rachel. I couldn’t tell Jake. I couldn’t—I couldn’t look at him without being afraid that he would find out.” From her throat came a noise half-obstructed.
When my brother was in the hospital after a car crash last year, I saw my mother perform concern for him for the first time since middle school. Not even through the parade of counselors, therapists, and doctors, had she shown a gravitation towards the kind of worry tinged with affection that I’d always seen played in television family dramas. But standing beside his hospital bed, gripping the railing beside his bruised, cut face, she had wept like a chunk of her body had been torn away. I watched her from his feet, disgusted.
Before we left, she said to me, “Go hug your brother, Rachel. We’re so lucky we’re here.”
My brother and I had looked at each other, the wound along his eye creasing as he raised an eyebrow.
I’d watched Sarah tend to her son for seven years. I remembered his sixth birthday party, most of the festive paper plates still stacked on the buffet table, fried wontons glazed in cold grease, Sarah sitting cross-legged on her living room floor with Isaac, laughing as he tried to strap a party hat to her head, landing it instead over her eye. I remembered the warble in her voice when she told me about her meeting with the school principal, perched on her bed behind the closed door so Isaac wouldn’t hear. The fury. The radiance. I remembered the week before he died, when I went over to return a book I’d borrowed and stayed for dinner. “Go get washed up,” she’d said to him. When he wouldn’t rise from the couch, she’d inserted hands beneath his armpits, thumbing tears from his eyes as he protested. He’d battered her shoulders, caught her mouth with a little fist.
“Isaac, Isaac,” she’d said. “I’m sorry. You can watch after dinner. Is that okay?” She’d turned her head from his flailing arms. “After dinner you can watch.”
There was no apology now. I couldn’t look at her. I studied the highway lane lines outside the window, something hard and hot caught in my chest that soon robbed me of vision, the outline of the window blurred through water. A tear fell on the armrest. It was a circle.
In the hospital that day, beside the mint green shape of my brother’s legs, my mother’s desire had collapsed. I’d heard in her cries the corpse of what I always knew was true: she did not know how to love, and she did not want our bodies, our selves here to remind her. I knew the hysteria that colored her sobs could be from nowhere but recognition, the recognition that what she had wanted had come so close to becoming her life. My brother’s chin had been bandaged, but the whole time she was there, not once did it crinkle with speech.
I could have responded to Sarah, but I didn’t want the words dimmed by wind streaming over the car, so I said nothing.
Sarah said, “I didn’t tell you this before.”
We passed a sign for a rest stop, and she latched onto it, eyes wide. She said, bland as glass, “Should we get more gas?”
I couldn’t see the meter, and she knew.
She crooked her head, and I heard the bones in her neck slide into place. The parentheses around her mouth deepened. She sighed, said, “I didn’t tell you before, but I’m going to be staying with my mother for a while.” She sniffed. “She understands, just like you understand, Rachel.”
A car veered into the space, much too small, between us and the car in front. Sarah braked hard, her mouth a tight line. As the seatbelt pushed into my chest, a moan like a motel door rusty on its hinges leaked from me.
Sarah straightened the car’s momentum, tapped the brake until we were no longer tailgating. “I’ll call Jake when I get there,” she said, “but can you take the car back?”
I closed my eyes. Sun shone red through my eyelids. The pads of Sarah’s fingers scraped, soft over the turn signal. I let myself be thrown by the changing of lanes.
When my father died, my brother and I put my mother in a nursing home. “Will you visit?” she asked just before we left. I didn’t have to see my brother’s face to know the slack jaw, the smooth slant of his cheeks that he presented during duplicity. “Of course,” I’d said.
“Of course.” I imagined the way home, my weight in the seat Sarah had grooved. The green drive, the roads, the highway tracked by all the tires before me.

“It’s telling stories…that brings us together in a community,” director Lelaina E. Vogel ’15 says about “Players,” a student-written drama that will premiere in the Adams Pool Theater on Nov. 14. The show follows Alex (Alex B. Zaloum ’16), a director, in his attempt to put on a show in a war torn city. To his dismay, his old friends have been separated on either side of the conflict. The play puts the power of theater to the test. “[It is about] the light…theater keeps shining in the darkness—its capacity to spread hope, to spread reconciliation in conflict zones, to humanize the other, to create a formidable community wherever it goes,” playwright Alice Abracen ’15 says.
The production within the show Alex hopes to put on is “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” a screenwriting decision with which Abracen was not immediately confident. However, as “Players” developed, the themes of each play—both “Players” and the Shakespeare production within it––become perfectly intertwined.
“Originally I was hoping not to do ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ because I had done it so many times that I just wanted to get it out of my life. But I wanted [the play in “Players”] to be a Shakespearean comedy…because I wanted it to breed laughter and closeness among the cast rather than have them dwell on the darkness that lies within them,” Abracen says. “‘Midsummer’ is great because, like a lot of Shakespearean comedies, here is something very dark at the core…and it’s a play about these young people that run somewhere for refuge outside the city. They’re seeking refuge outside the forest in this other world.”
References to the theater go beyond the characters’ production. The director character, Alex, is a huge Shakespeare buff and often brings the Bard into conversation. “Every chance he can, get he’s doing a Shakespeare reference…. [Alice] takes Shakespeare and puts it into the context of whatever is going on,” Zaloum says.
Originally written for her “Introduction to Playwriting” class, “Players” delves into darker material for Abracen. “It packs a huge punch,” Vogel says. “I don’t work on shows that don’t have an emotional punch to the gut, and this is the hardest punch I’ve ever given.”

We’re not talking baseball here. “Bat Boy: The Musical” is the wild story of a hero—half-bat, half-boy—who wishes to be accepted by his family and community. But it’s not easy being a mutant. The fast-paced musical poses questions about acceptance and love while walking the fine line between camp and drama.
This production isn’t working with the original book; instead, they have worked hands-on with the original writers in an incredible opportunity to revise the script. Funded by the Office of the Arts, composer and lyricist Laurence O'Keefe ’91 and book writers Keythe Farley and Brian Flemming flew into Cambridge to hold workshops with the cast and staff. “The rewrites make the audience feel much closer to Bat Boy immediately,” director Alexandra M. Kiley ’15 says. “He has quite a personality that comes through a lot better in this version.”
The 10-person cast, needless to say, is thrilled to be part of the production. They emphasize their genuine enthusiasm for the characters and story due to the relevance of the show’s themes—despite his mutant identity, Bat Boy’s struggles ring true with the social problems of an undergrad. “He’s one of the most earnest characters onstage, but he just is really strange, so his earnestness comes off in very weird ways,” Jacob D. Rienstra ’17 (who plays Bat Boy) says. “As weird of a character as he is, he’s actually very relatable because he wants to fit in, he wants to be accepted, he wants to be friends with people—and that’s what everybody wants.”
The music, also partially reworked by O’Keefe, will be performed by a five-piece band featuring keyboard, bass guitar, guitar, and drums. “I think music just conveys so much,” Kiley says. “The reason why I love musicals is there’s nothing more evocative than someone singing to you. I think Larry does a great job of writing the music that needs to be written as opposed to a style that he’s predetermined.”
Tess V. Davison ’16, playing Shelley (Bat Boy’s love interest), is supportive of the changes in her characterization. “I think that the changes in the script have really changed Shelley’s relationship with Bat Boy a lot,” Davison says. “You see their interactions developing. It feels more realistic.” She also agreed that the opportunity to work with the original writers infused the show with new energy.
The fresh facets of this production allows audiences to see the musical in a way they have never seen it before. As Kiley says, “Once you think the show can’t get any weirder, it does.”

“In performance, the coolest thing is when you’re surprised as the dancer,” says Julia K. Cataldo ’15, a dancer in LOOK UP, the first in a series of performances by the Harvard Dance Project. LOOK UP, described by creator Jill Johnson as a “gallery in motion,” brings audience interaction and a live-gallery setting to the art of dance in the form of a two-hour live-action performance that examines inspiration and movement in the digital age. LOOK UP’s dancers are enrolled in a year-long faculty-led ensemble course that seeks to foster creativity and fearlessness in artistry.
LOOK UP revolves around indeterminacy; throughout the installation, dancers move fluidly between partitioned rooms that each have a different theme. In the “Noticing” room, viewers use a Polaroid camera to snap a photograph of a hand or eye and hang them up in a frame. Dancers flit into the room, inquisitively inspect the photos, and use the photos as inspiration for movement. Likewise, visitors in the “Mapping” room use a faded green typewriter to finish prompts such as “A thunderstorm is…” and “My favorite sound is…” to create short, poignant sentences that, when read aloud, sound like spoken word poetry.
Essential to the experience of LOOK UP is the sense of interaction between individual dancers, dancers and the audience, and among audience members. Dancer Whitney M. Cover GSE ’15 emphasizes LOOK UP’s ability to create a feeling of solidarity. “I think that [LOOK UP] is really about sharing this world that we’ve created: a very special space that we’re all existing in together for this short period of time,” Cover says.
Maya M. Park ’16, a dancer in the project and active editor for Fifteen Minutes Magazine, agrees. “It’s a new way of looking at dance. And it’s a different space to exist in. It’s a place where you go see dance but you’re not sitting down watching a stage.”
Nieman Fellow and National Public Radio writer Kitty Eisele noted LOOK UP’s emphasis on audience participation. “I think dance isn’t just this thing you stare at,” Eisele said. “[Usually], there is a sense that you sit there [and watch the performance] for two hours like you’re watching TV. It’s very passive. [Here], it’s accessible. Anybody can do it. That’s what I’m taking from this.”
LOOK UP is a sensual feast, using sounds as well as lighting and touch to create a thoughtful, musing atmosphere. Aurally, the installation is mostly silence punctuated by repeating, industrial sounds: the screech of duct tape or the distant whistle of a train. The thrumming beats provide a backdrop for the dancers to experiment with rhythm and motion.
Cover acknowledges the difficulties in responding to unchanging source material. “I think that one of the challenges it presents is because it is monotonous, it’s our job not to be a slave to that monotony, and to keep variation and to maintain uncertainty and unpredictability and surprise and an internal driving rhythm in the absence of one.”
Another element that sets LOOK UP apart is the immediate spontaneity of the motions. “Something that we all feel is that the improvisation is very timeless,” Cataldo says. “It’s kind of the coolest thing—you’re in this world that’s like…the ‘not-knowing’ world. You think, ‘This is the timing that I’m doing.’ And [the other dancers are] doing a different timing.”
Park agrees. “We’ve been talking about...dance time versus real time,” Park says. “So rarely in real life do we even get to live in real time—to put up your hand and just sort of watch it for a while. So ideally, [LOOK UP] is a place where you can exhale for a bit. And for once, it’s okay to lose track of time. That’s where we have to be. And that’s where you chose to be.”
When asked about the inherent meaning of LOOK UP, Park and Cataldo laugh. “Well, are we looking up? Are [the dancers] looking up? Are we supposed to look up? What are we even looking at?”
So what is the inherent message? The best answer may be that there is no right answer.
“Jill refers to it as a movement gallery, and I think the intention is to look at this as you would a museum,” Cover says. “We’re trying to give the audience a choice. You have a choice of what you look at, you have a choice of when you come, but also…it’s hopefully maybe equating the experience of looking at contemporary art with looking at contemporary dance, where it’s about your interpretation.”
Regardless of its abstractness, the experience of LOOK UP seems to resonate with the audience. “I think it’s a physical manifestation of a beautiful desire to communicate something,” Eisele says. “I think [the dancers] were talking back to a dominant technical culture in a really poetic way. And they’re looking up, you know: ‘Step away from your phone and look up at each other.’”

The acceptance letter doesn’t mention it, and they don’t tell you at freshman orientation, but one of the unwritten rules of Harvard life is that you are expected to give casual tours of campus to friends and acquaintances who pass through the Boston area. These friends have an almost eerie ability to roll through Cambridge just as deadlines are approaching. Many have never seen the campus before. And whether they say so or not, they expect to be entertained.
On a campus this rich in history and tradition, that’s not as hard as it sounds. It’s always fun to wave your hand casually at Weld—“Oh, yeah, Mark Zuckerberg lived there”—(he didn’t)—or tell the story of your passing acquaintance with John Harvard’s left foot. You might even get a chuckle by making fun of the Science Center, which is, indeed, ugly.
Ugliness has its place, but beauty is the best form of entertainment. The next time Aunt Ida from Peoria is in town, take her to see the glass flowers.
Between 1887 and 1936, two German glass artists, the father and son team Leopold and Rudolph Blaschka, collaborated on a collection of over 3,000 realistic glass models of plants—everything from morning glories to cashew cross-sections to rare North American ferns. The glass flowers are world famous, and rightly so. Each specimen is a mind-boggling technical feat. You would not believe that anyone could make anything like it by hand, let alone with glass and wire.
The collection lives in wooden display cases in a musty room on the top floor of the Harvard Museum of Natural History. In the low light, many of the flowers look real. Not a single twig is out of place. The edge of the smallest leaf is perfectly jagged.
Walk through the swinging doors into the flower gallery and stand before the Blaschkas' humble workbench. Laid out on the pockmarked surface are a few tools—an awl, pliers of different sizes, small bottles of dye, and a simple burner to heat the glass. The table alone is enough to pull you back into the glassmakers’ world. Did time move slower then? How did it feel to hunch over that desk? Were the Blaschkas proud of their work? Or were they constantly dissatisfied, always striving for the perfect leaf?
It’s understandable that Harvard students don’t like to give tours. Places in themselves don’t matter so much as the memories they’re attached to. To anyone who has forlornly watched the sun rise from Lamont Café, the library will never be just another building. It’s easy to show someone around and feel at the end that the school you’ve just showed off isn’t the one you attend.
I don’t care where Zuckerberg lived. Someday—and I hope it’s soon—they’ll knock down the Science Center and build another one with a little more natural light. That’ll last another fifty years. Everything forgettable will be forgotten.
The flowers are wonderful because they’re the physical trace of two lifetimes of work dedicated to one beautiful, lasting, outrageous dream. To me, that dream manifests as the beauty of perfection and quiet dedication. The flowers are a tribute to tedium.
In the end, though, the exhibit is not about the flowers; it’s about the glassmakers.
The achievement is magnificent, but the beauty is in the obsession, the patience of the execution, the carrying-on of the legacy, and the image of the man with his tools at the desk. In their own subtle way, the Blaschkas teach me how to think about the paradoxes of this school, where everyone has too many passions and there is never enough time.
Every time I take a guest to see the flowers, we always walk out slowly, in a trance, blinking in the brightness of the day. And then, before one of us checks his phone, and oh-look-at-the-time-where-should-we-eat-lunch, we stand together for a minute, in awe of the madness of art.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two years, events close to home have heightened the general interest in—and fear of—unwarranted or unexpected surveillance. Last week's revelations that Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol authorized the photographing of classrooms to collect data on attendance in classes during the spring 2014 semester brought them closer once again. The study sparked significant backlash from some faculty members, with some like Professor Peter Burgard going so far as to say the actions amounted to “spying on students and faculty without telling them.”
Bol’s actions must spark many questions about how the university must balance privacy rights and faculty control over the classroom with the quest to constantly improve teaching methodology. In this case, Bol’s researchers went too far.
The closed, essentially secret manner in which the study was authorized without any consultation of the faculty whose classrooms were monitored is troubling. Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 commented at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting on November 4 calling for “assurance that all the students and faculty who were subjects of this nonconsensual study will be informed that they were under photographic surveillance”—a necessary remedy at this point.
But given that Professor Lewis was only made aware of the surveillance from “two of [his] faculty colleagues”, and that Bol personally discussed the study and “made appointments...with course heads,” but apparently no students, it is clear that there do not exist robust enough disclosure requirements for such studies. Vice Provost Bol could not be reached for comment on this issue on Tuesday, but we hope both Bol and University President Drew G. Faust heed Professor Lewis's call.
Professor Lewis’s specific indication that neither of his surveilled colleagues were tenured points to a whole other potential issue with Bol’s proceedings.
We do not doubt the potential importance of class attendance data but administrators should not intimidate and surprise faculty, especially when non-tenured,  after the fact. The data collection was ostensibly for mere use in an academic study. But the way in which it was presented to faculty brings this into question. It is unconvincing to argue that there were no alternatives to the path taken to collect data on attendance. Perhaps professors could have been informed before and students directly after, so as to mitigate sample bias.
Harvard’s policies regarding photography in the classroom require significant updating. The insidious potential uses of photographic data should not be forgotten. According to current policy, “photography or videotaping which is carried out by the university or its schools” will “[g]enerally... be permitted”. But there is not a single mention of student privacy or consent.  The administration has the ability to strike a better balance between student privacy and improved pedagogical practices—and they must.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted unanimously in favor of a motion asking the President and Fellows to suspend changes to the health benefits offered faculty and non-union staff for 2015. In justifying the benefits changes, the University offered four main explanations for its addition of deductibles and co-insurance: (1) the cost of benefits relative to the overall budget; (2) parity with peer institutions; (3) social science on containing health care costs and (4) the future financial health of the University. In advancing these explanations, the University has offered information that is incomplete, incorrect, deeply misleading, and ethically troubling.
According to the University’s financial report issued on Friday, Harvard’s spending on benefits (healthcare and other benefits are not disaggregated) for current employees has risen. However, the report also makes clear that, contrary to information provided in the Open Enrollment Preview Brochure and at the October FAS meeting, those costs are not rising relative to faculty and non-union staff compensation. Rather, considering the expanding employee pool at Harvard, the cost of benefits appears to be well under control.
The second argument offered in favor of the health benefits changes has been that we need to remain in line with our peers. We contend that the only peer pressure Harvard should heed is that which makes us a better research university. Increasing salaries and benefits might do this if it allowed Harvard to recruit and retain the brightest minds in our fields of research and teaching, as well as the post-doctoral fellows and staff needed to support these research and teaching endeavors.
Instead, we are told in effect that we should lower our expectations if other universities have done so or might in the future. Such a cynical vision will not advance the long-term goals of the university as a place where new and important knowledge is produced. Moreover, the argument is not only specious—it is false: While some universities have adopted co-insurance, most of our peers (our national competitors Yale, Princeton, Chicago, and Stanford as well as institutions in our region such as Boston University, MIT, or Wellesley) offer an array of benefits choices including plans with no deductibles and no co-insurance.
Perhaps the most distressing argument advanced in favor of the changes, however, has been one that draws on a social science experiment from the 1970s to suggest that a co-insurance system, where the insured must pay a percentage of after-deductible costs, is the best way to contain health-care costs. At the November FAS meeting, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and members of the University Benefits Committee asserted that because the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, or HIE, demonstrated a reduction in healthcare utilization without decreasing overall well-being, the new Harvard plan will do likewise.
We assert that, on the contrary, the HIE is irrelevant to the present benefits proposal before us.
The HIE randomized individuals into different insurance plans (some received health insurance free of charge, while others faced a range of co-insurance options). It found that those paying a higher percentage of costs visited primary care physicians less frequently and reduced their health-care expenditures as a result.  But copays for regular physician visits have long been standard and are already part of Harvard’s plan. What Harvard now proposes is further extending cost-sharing to hospitalizations, surgery, and diagnostic testing via co-insurance.
The HIE’s measurement of outcomes is also irrelevant to the matters that concern all of us. The study looked at indicators of general health such as blood pressure, visual acuity, and propensity to smoke. The relevant question for today’s Harvard is not whether going to one’s primary care doctor more often makes one smoke less, but whether a diagnostic test ordered by that doctor could save one’s life, or detect an illness in time to allow for a less invasive, and perhaps in the long run, less expensive treatment.
Co-insurance is not only of questionable utility in the 21st century—at a time when diagnostic testing is much more effective at influencing outcomes than it was in the 1970s—it also unethically transfers risk and expense to the most vulnerable in our community.
Finally, the administration has raised the specter of the University’s future financial health as a rationale for reducing benefits. The financial report released on Friday shows that the University’s financial situation is stable, not in crisis. The proposed changes transfer costs onto employees at a time of a budget surplus, and may have pernicious and potentially devastating effects on the health and welfare of Harvard employees, while increasing anxiety, risk, and alienation.
Such a drastic cut could only be justified in an atmosphere in which all members of our community were convinced that sacrifices were in order—not in an atmosphere of relative stability, forecasted growth, successful fundraising, and transformative plans for expansion into Allston.
We often hear that Harvard is the apex of academic research and teaching institutions, and that part of its success is due to its sense of community. The University ignored that community when it embarked on a secret and non-consultative planning process and disregarded the strong concerns that faculty have about their own health and that of less well-paid members of our community.
The result is a plan that imposes a serious financial burden on those with chronic illness or who face medical emergencies for themselves or their families. This plan is based on a flawed process, on a misguided charge to the University Benefits Committee, on misinformation about our peers, and on outdated research that is not relevant to the current situation. It is unfair to the most vulnerable members of our community, and not worthy of our great university.

Harvard University Health Services is planning to significantly restructure patient resources, eventually closing the Stillman Infirmary and shifting resources from overnight care to other health services, according to a copy of an internal email sent to UHS workers late last month.
Beginning with the start of the spring semester, the University will offer urgent care visits from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. each day, but will direct students to phone consultation services during overnight hours, according to the copy of the email sent on behalf of Director of HUHS Paul J. Barreira. Stillman Infirmary will close its doors by June 1, 2015.
Barreira confirmed the authenticity of the internal email Tuesday evening and described the restructuring in a phone interview shortly thereafter. Lindsey Baker, a communications officer for UHS, was also present on the call.
The move “has nothing to do with the University money,” Barreira said. When asked if this year’s UHS budget will differ from that of next year, Barreira said “no.”
He said that the motivation for the changes came from a UHS analysis he helped conduct for a couple of years, in which he found that overnight urgent-hour services are underutilized.
“The principle...is that the resources that are used for overnight services will be redirected to [other] services; both the space and the money used to hire clinical staff will be repurposed for providing these other services,” he clarified. He added that nurses from one department will not be moved to another department. Rather, Barreira will examine the type of clinical staff needed to expand services and then hire new employees to fill the new positions.
Though Barreira said that he did not reach out to resident deans, House masters, or tutors while examining UHS data in planning the changes, he said that he heard a recurring request from students for more access to same-day services, including counseling and mental health services.
The changes will only affect a few staff members, Barreira said. He declined to specify the size of the overnight staff at the infirmary without consulting HUHS’s human resources department.
Once the changes take effect, those seeking medical assistance during the overnight hours will be instructed to consult with UHS phone triage partners, Night Nurse and Riverside. Their symptoms will be evaluated, and those in need of immediate serious care will be directed to the emergency department. Counseling and Mental Health Service clinicians will offer aid with telephone triage on the weekend, according to the email.
Students are frequently directed to nearby Mt. Auburn Hospital for more serious treatment.
Stillman Infirmary currently contains ten beds and provides 24-hour care to Harvard affiliates. During overnight care, the infirmary houses individuals who do not require hospital treatment, but who “are too ill to stay in [their] residence,” according to HUHS’ website. Under the College’s alcohol and drug amnesty policy, any student may bring another student to seek treatment at Stillman, or an outside facility, without either individual facing disciplinary action from the College.
“My team is confident that we can do this and that [people] will get the appropriate care. The plan is to implement this kind of expanded community out-patient model starting at the beginning of the spring term, while keeping the floor space and staff available, as what I call a safety net,” Barreira said.
Barreira said that he does not expect UHS staff to be laid off.
Around 25 individuals are affiliated with Stillman in Harvard’s internal directory, whether as a health assistant, nurse, or unpaid consultant.
Stillman Infirmary was founded in 1902. The number of beds at the infirmary has fluctuated, but has primarily declined in recent years. In 2012, UHS considered plans to close Stillman Infirmary between between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. from June 4 to Aug. 12. At the time, Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents many UHS employees, said that HUCTW was told that the potential closures would have “no impact” on its members. Barreira said that the majority of Stillman employees are not unionized.
Barreira said that he has already been in discussions with House Masters and resident deans in the past few weeks, following a suggestion from a College administrator. His last meeting with House masters, he said, will take place on Wednesday. He plans to discuss the changes with proctors and tutors in the future, and then open up discussion about the service changes to the Harvard community. He said he plans to have a FAQ and feedback form online concerning the changes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rachel A. Gillett, an assistant director of studies for the Committee on Degrees in History and Literature, assumed the role of interim House dean for Lowell House on Nov. 3 after current dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03 took a maternity leave.
Gillett was tapped for the position about a month ago, after a search that had begun in mid-August, according to Diana L. Eck, one of Lowell’s House masters. Eck also said Gillett had worked with Casey on the History and Literature committee, adding that the house had been considering senior tutors for the position. Gillett was not previously affiliated with Lowell.
“She is so genial and also very professional,” Eck said, noting that Gillett’s administrative experience in History and Literature already gives her a “pretty good sense of some of the crises that come up in students’ schedules this time of year.”
Eck said that the transition has been “pretty smooth,” and Gillett has already held “intensive office hours.”
Gillett said that her first week on the job has been busy, but like other resident deans, she hopes to “serve students, be a part of the community, and really be a valuable resource.”
“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind,” Gillett said. “It has given me such a phenomenal respect for resident deans. They are such allies for their students.”
Gillett, who is originally from New Zealand, studies French colonial history and is currently working on a book concerning African American jazz musicians in France during the 1920s. She will be joined by her husband and 18-month-old daughter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Residents of Franklin Street in Allston demanded a response from Harvard at a recent Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting regarding alleged damage to their homes caused by construction on a nearby University-owned plot of land. Homeowners claimed that vibrations from the site led to structural cracks in their homes, despite the fact that an investigation performed by the Harvard-hired developer did not find vibrations strong enough to cause structural damage.
In mid-April, owners of four homes first complained of vibrations from pile driving at the construction of the Barry’s Corner Retail and Residential Commons, a mixed-use development under construction on Harvard-owned land. The University has contracted the site out to developer Samuels & Associates.
Cindy Marchando, one of the homeowners who came forward, said she began feeling vibrations as early as March 12. Edward G. LeFlore, the construction mitigation consultant for both the University and Samuels, said that “perceivable vibrations” are not necessarily strong enough to cause damage to homes.
“Vibrations are felt for everything,” LeFlore said. “You don’t really see [damage to homes’ foundations] that much.”
In the City of Boston, developers must perform inspections and install vibration monitors in any home within 300 feet of a blast site, according to Leslie Cohen, the principal and executive vice president of development at Samuels. Neither condition applied to the Barry’s Corner project, however, since the nearest home stands almost twice the required distance from the site, and the developer performed pile driving rather than blasting.
Nevertheless, after community members raised concerns about vibrations, Samuels performed housing surveys at the end of April, at which time residents identified what they called new cracks and gaps in support beams.
“All the homes have exactly the same issues,” Marchando said. “I’m 100 percent sure that the damage came from construction.”
Samuels agreed to install vibration monitors in the homes in mid-May. After removing the monitors on July 1, engineers said that the measured vibrations were unlikely to be the cause of damage to foundations. Moreover, the cracks identified in the surveys did not match the type of damage associated with construction vibrations, according to LeFlore.
“The ranges we saw were not anywhere near that [threshold of structural damage],” LeFlore said. “They were in the levels of perceived vibrations.”
Marchando said, however, that the damage occurred before the vibration monitors were installed.
LeFlore and a safety manager from the construction company hired by Samuels visited the homes in May to inform the homeowners of the opportunity to file an insurance claim. To date, only one claim has been filed, according to Cohen. The claim was rejected due to a lack of specificity, she added.
Marchando said that she hoped the problem could be resolved between the homeowners, Harvard, and Samuels. She added that she hesitated to file a claim due to worries that the ordeal would become too time-consuming, a concern she said that the other homeowners share. Of the four homeowners who initially complained, one declined to speak to The Crimson, while two others could not be reached for comment.
Marchando and the other homeowners again raised the issue of damage to homes at the Oct. 30 task force meeting because they felt Harvard has a responsibility to address their concerns.
Kevin Casey, Harvard's associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said in an interview that while the University has an interest in ensuring that community concerns are addressed, community members should continue to seek redress through Samuels, the Barry’s Corner developer. According to an emailed statement from Cohen, a Samuels representative and safety officer will contact homeowners again to “walk them through the process of filing a claim.”
Raymond V. Mellone, the chairman of the Task Force, said that the alleged damages would be an agenda item at the next task force meeting on Nov. 24.
Homeowners remain concerned that if Harvard does not respond now, the problem could reappear in other Allston projects in the near future.
“The fear is that this will compound the problem, damages might continue, and eventually we could lose our homes,” Marchando said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From commemorative tours to church services and stadium runs, Harvard affiliates found their own ways to honor veterans Tuesday.
Though the University—which boasts one of the top numbers of alumni who have earned Medals of Honor—recognizes Veterans Day as a University holiday and many offices were closed, Harvard remained open for classes.
Still, Nick D. Starling, a veteran at the Harvard Extension School, led the Harvard Military Symbols/Memorials Walk, organized by the Harvard Veterans Alumni Organization, on Tuesday. The tour covered about two miles and aimed to “memorialize many of the 1,352 men and women of Harvard who made the ultimate sacrifice,” according to the HVAO website.
Starling, along with the HVAO, proposed that the Memorials Walk become an official tour option through Harvard Information Center, along with the guided historic tour that is already offered.
“I don’t see a reason why not,” he said. “Harvard is very distinguished when it comes to military service.”
Students and faculty found other ways to recognize Veterans Day as well. On Sunday, Memorial Church held a service to commemorate Veterans Day, featuring recent Harvard Business School graduate and Army Soldier’s Medal recipient Colonel Everett Spain as the speaker.
“We rely on these [veterans] to preserve and protect our freedom and keep us safe,” said Charley M. Falletta ’16, a student in the Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, who participated in the ceremony. “It’s really important that we take at least one day out of the year to stop and thank them for their service and to recognize that they have made sacrifices that have been pretty huge.”
On Tuesday, Memorial Church held an additional service in honor of Armistice Day, a holiday recognized by many Commonwealth nations that commemorates the end of World War I and also takes place on Nov. 11. In the evening, a Veterans Day Stadium Run was held for veterans, ROTC cadets and midshipmen, and students, organized by a veteran at the Business School.
Falletta noted that graduate students organized many of these Veterans Day ceremonies.
“Obviously we don’t have the day off school, and Harvard doesn’t do anything University-wide to commemorate Veteran’s Day,” Falletta said. “There’s a real void left by the University’s lack of activity. But the graduate schools do a lot on their own to fill that void, and they always include the undergrads.”
While Starling too hopes to initiate more recognition of veterans through the proposed Memorials Walk tours, he said he thinks holding classes on Veterans Day actually honors veterans.
“Veterans serve to advance society as a whole,” he said. “I can think of nothing that would advance society more than attending classes at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Slap us in the cuffs. I’ll serve my time,” Luke R. Heine ’17, a presidential candidate in this year’s Undergraduate Council elections, laughed on Saturday at the possibility of rules sanctions.
On Tuesday, the Election Commission appeared to carry out at least some version of just that, levelling $15 in fines on him and his running mate for replacing bulletins on dining hall tables with ones containing a watermarked campaign message, a violation of elections rules.
Heine and Stephen A. Turban ’17, the only UC ticket composed of sophomores, initiated the campaign stunt on Saturday, snatching copies of bulletins in dining halls, scanning them into their computers, and watermarking a campaign publicity image into the background. They then made additional copies and replaced the original bulletins with their modified version between midnight and 6 a.m. Tuesday morning, switching the newsletters or pamphlets in Annenberg Hall and every House except Leverett and Kirkland.
The two did not ask for authorization in any House, according to Heine.
Heine said he and Turban wanted to add “spice” to an often “bland” election. He added that the plan was “absolutely” against the campaign rules. Matthew C. Estes ’18, the Election Commission chair, appeared to agree with them on at least the second assessment.
“The posters are just out of control,” Estes said Tuesday.
Estes said he was notified that the posters had been set up in Adams and Mather Houses. The ticket, which, like all the others, is allotted $225  in UC funds this year to cover campaign expenses, was fined $5 for the papers in Adams and $10 for those in Mather.
The pair also reprinted an original version of Mather’s newsletter and plans to front the cost with campaign funds.
Though Estes said the Election Commission knows about the infractions in Annenberg, he said members have yet to formally issue a penalty. Still, he said Heine and Turban will likely be fined for those violations as well.
Both Heine and Turban said they did not intend to anger anyone and appeared to regard the stunt as at least a minor victory.
“It’s kind of like cooking, right? I think what we did was really creative and was like a creative spice, but I mean that doesn't work in some dishes,” Heine said, referring to the Houses who reported them.
“I don’t actually know if he knows the extent of it,” Turban said of Estes.
Estes, on the other hand, appeared confused about why a ticket would knowingly violate the rules.
“It’s just very frustrating that they would do that, personally,” he said when prompted on that possibility.
Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16, another presidential ticket, were also fined $5 for exceeding a pre-campaign spending limit of $50. The pair expended $75, according to Estes.

A month after Harvard administrators announced that the University was collaborating with peer institutions to create a national sexual assault survey, experts say that the survey may provide a model for the rest of the country.
Former University provost Steven E. Hyman, chair of a task force commissioned last spring to address sexual misconduct on campus, announced last month that Harvard was collaborating with peer institutions to create a survey, which the University plans to conduct next spring, to gauge the circumstances in which unwanted sexual advances occur.
The Association of American Universities is overseeing efforts by Harvard and other member universities to develop the survey, according to David I. Laibson ’88, member of Harvard’s sexual assault task force.
The AAU expects Congress to soon enact legislation that would mandate a campus “climate” survey, said Mollie B. Flounlacker, associate vice president for federal relations of the AAU. A White House task force had recommended in April that all colleges conduct a mandatory sexual assault survey.
Flounlacker noted that the AAU is working closely with the office of Senator Claire C. McCaskill of Missouri, who, along with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, has spearheaded the effort to implement legislation that addresses sexual assault.
“We think that a survey is critical to making progress,” Flounlacker said. “But we don’t think that one designed by the federal government, specifically the Department of Education, is going to be helpful. In fact, it could be quite misleading and not make progress, the kind of progress we want to make on this issue.”
To that end, the AAU hopes its survey will become the framework for any survey mandated by the federal government, Flounlacker added.
“We want to create a survey that is absolutely world-class,” Laibson said.
The institutions that implement the AAU’s survey will be bound by the standard set of questions outlined by the AAU for the first year. They will only be able to insert the names of school-specific offices and resources into the questions, Flounlacker said.
This system would preclude questions that reference Harvard final clubs, or other organizations unique to the University.
Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, an organizer of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said that she hoped that the national survey would include questions that could highlight a college’s institutional flaws. However, she added she believes that even if Harvard could control its questions, it might still be hesitant to include hard-hitting questions that cast Harvard institutions in an unfavorable light.
“Whether [survivors’] experience with the administration after they experience sexual assault is actually making things worse…those are the questions that Harvard has no incentives to be asking,” she said.
The AAU expects colleges to be able to modify and hone the questions down the line. Laibson, who serves on an AAU committee overseeing the survey, said he believes colleges will have more control over the content in the future.
Fox-Penner also pointed out the need for accessibility and transparency in the survey results, saying there is often “a black cloud around the data that Harvard currently collects.”
Although participating universities will be able to decide on an individual basis how to report survey results, Laibson said everyone he has spoken to at Harvard is committed to “maximum transparency” while still preserving anonymity.
“We will share with the world what we learn with the survey,” he said. “I’ve spoken to no one who is against that.”
Laibson added that he expects all schools to take a similar course of action, and that the AAU will conduct national analysis with the compiled data.
According to Laibson, Harvard’s decision to help develop and use the AAU’s survey was made after extensive conversations with Harvard administrators, the AAU, and the “Ivy Plus” consortium—an informal body of elite colleges.
“We feel very strongly that there’s great benefit in having data that’s harmonized across schools,” Laibson said. “Every school could have its own survey, but there would be no way to compare data and leverage knowledge from one campus to another.”
Similar sexual assault surveys are already underway in several universities. MIT, for example, formulated and conducted a survey last spring delving into the campus culture surrounding sexual assault. Unlike the proposed national survey, it was designed by members of the MIT community.
The MIT study found that at least 17 percent of female MIT undergraduates indicated that they had been sexually assaulted. It also reported that 67 percent of MIT undergraduates said they think that “rape and sexual assault can happen unintentionally, especially if alcohol is involved.”
According to Laibson, Harvard plans to deploy the survey in spring 2014 at Harvard. He expects Harvard to release the results in early fall 2015. Flounlacker said the AAU will announce later this week which research firm it has contracted to conduct its survey.
The survey will be available in its first year to the 62 American and Canadian research universities that make up the AUU, along with the members of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, an umbrella organization composed of private universities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her two seasons with Harvard women’s soccer, Midge Purce has already accumulated an impressive list of accomplishments. Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Ivy League Player of the Year. Member of the U.S. U-20 national team.
But perhaps the most important accolade is the shortest of all: Ancient Eight champion.
By scoring two goals in a 2-1 win over Columbia (7-4-6, 2-3-2) last Saturday, the sophomore Purce claimed her second Ivy League crown. As a team, the Crimson (10-4-2, 5-1-1 Ivy) has won three of the past four conference titles.
“It’s hard to describe how much it means to win the title again,” senior Bethany Kanten said. “It’s an amazing feeling to reap the rewards for our hard work and commitment.”
In the 63rd minute, Purce broke a 1-1 tie with a header goal off a free kick from Kanten. A moment before, Purce had earned the foul, which the referee whistled just outside the box.
Purce also supplied Harvard’s first goal in the 30th minute. After forward Emily Mosbacher played a cross into the box, Purce slid a first-time finish into the right side of the goal. On the game, Purce recorded four more shots than the entire Lions side.
“[Midge] was awesome,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “We always get a lot of chances, and one thing we worked on in practice was just finishing them…. Midge obviously worked on that this week, and it really showed in her play.”
For the second consecutive season, Purce leads the Crimson in goals and points, with eight and 18 respectively. She is one of five players to see action in all 16 games, starting 14 of them.
“The most dangerous part of her game for opponents is her work ethic and her attitude of always looking to score goals and create dangerous situations,” Kanten said. “As a defender, it’s hard to face that kind of determination and passion.”
The league title adds to a resume of success that stretches back to high school, when Purce won Gatorade Player of the Year in Maryland and suited up for the U-17 women’s national team that qualified for the 2012 World Cup, starting three games.
She will have a chance to add another accomplishment to her growing resume this Saturday when Harvard begins NCAA tournament play against Central Connecticut State at home.
A year ago, the team stumbled in its tournament opener, losing 1-0 to Boston University in a game where it managed just four total shots, two on goal.
The second time around, the Crimson will once again rely on Purce, who had three shots in last year’s game, to give it an edge offensively.
“She’s so determined to win and so passionate about our team,” Kanten added. “Our team can feel her energy on the field, and it brings everyone up.”

­In last season’s game against Union, goalkeeper Steve Michalek learned why a two-goal lead is never safe in hockey.
After the host Crimson jumped to a 2-0 first period advantage, the Dutchmen pounded Michalek with 47 shots. Four of them found the back of the net, and Union, which would win the national championship later that season, came back for a 4-2 victory.
Michalek may not be able to replay that loss, but last Saturday, he did his best to erase it.
With eleven seconds left in overtime, and Harvard clinging to a 2-2 deadlock after surrendering another 2-0 lead, a Union forward beat the Crimson defense for a point-blank chance against Michalek. But the 6’2” goalkeeper smothered the opportunity to ensure a tie against the No. 8 Dutchmen.
Over the game, Michalek recorded 42 saves, one shy of the career high that he set in last year’s defeat against Union. Many of his heroics came late, as the Dutchmen outshot Harvard 27-13 over the third frame and overtime. The Union game marked Michalek’s second impressive performance off the weekend. The day before, the goaltender had earned his third career shutout in a 4-0 win over RPI.
“Michalek handled a tremendous amount of pressure around the net,” Crimson coach Ted Donato said. “[He] made some big saves.”
Not every college goalkeeper can boast more than 40 games of experience, but Michalek, who will eclipse 2500 minutes on the ice in his next game, has played 45.
As a freshman, Michalek beat out then-sophomore Raphael Girard for the starting job.  Michalek played in 24 games and recorded nearly 600 saves. However, Girard took over in February when Michalek conceded three early goals in a game against Quinnipiac.
The storyline was reversed in the 2013-2014 season. After returning from a year with the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders in the USHL, Michalek watched Girard rise to the top of the depth chart.
Then, in February, Harvard suffered a 6-0 loss to Northeastern. This time it was Michalek who skated off the bench and into a sudden starting role.
Michalek’s experience extends beyond the Crimson team. In addition to playing with the RoughRiders, the goalkeeper played for the U.S. U-18 national team in an international tournament and was selected by the Minnesota Wild in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.
“For us to be a good team, we’re going to have to rely on him a lot,” junior forward Jimmy Vesey said. “It’s good to see him playing well already.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long streaks die hard. On Tuesday night, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team shrugged off one of its most irksome ones.
Sophomore forward Alex Kerfoot scored three goals as the Crimson (2-0-2, 1-0-2 ECAC) defeated No. 8 Boston College, 6-3, at Conte Forum. The play of a powerful top line propelled Harvard to its first win over the Eagles (4-5-0, 1-4-0 HE) in 10 games, a wait lasting eight years.
Harvard’s first liners—Kerfoot, junior Jimmy Vesey, and junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo—contributed on all six of the Crimson’s goals as Kerfoot earned his first career hat trick.
“Our best players were our best players,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Kerfoot was flying all night. He was really using his speed and his skill and creating plays.”
The visitors raced out to a 5-1 lead in the third period before the Eagles drew within two goals with just over six minutes remaining. Kerfoot tapped in an empty net goal off a feed from Vesey with 28 seconds left to give Harvard a final insurance marker.
Kerfoot opened the scoring on the power play with under five minutes left in the first period. Criscuolo put the Crimson up two in the final minute of the frame, forcing a turnover by BC junior captain defenseman Michael Matheson in the Eagles’ zone before beating senior goaltender Brad Barone glove-side.
Like in Saturday’s tie against Union, the Crimson carried a two-goal lead into the first intermission after a dominant opening frame. This time, however, the team was able to close things out.
“We maybe made it a little more difficult on ourselves in the third period than we had to, but we battled through it,” Donato said. “I thought it was a real solid team effort all the way around.”
Sophomore forward Matthew Gaudreau halved Harvard’s lead less than two minutes into the second frame, but goals from Vesey and sophomore forward Phil Zielonka would extend the Crimson’s advantage by the period’s end.
Vesey redirected a shot from captain Max Everson at 14:08 in the period. Four minutes later, Zielonka pounced on a deflected shot from Criscuolo for a three-goal lead.
In the third, Kerfoot redirected a shot from freshman Joseph Caffrey to give the Crimson its biggest lead of the night, but BC responded with two quick strikes less than two minutes apart at 12:03 and 13:46 from senior forward Destry Straight and freshman forward Alex Tuch.
With the win, Harvard remains one of only three undefeated teams in Division I hockey. The Crimson also remains perfect on the penalty kill. The team’s unit stifled all seven of BC’s opportunities and is now 15-for-15 on the season.
“I thought we did a really good job clogging up the middle of the ice at times,” Donato said. “And when we needed the big save, we got it.”
BC entered the night looking to reverse a streak of their own. The Eagles started the week as the nation’s No. 3 team but dropped its third straight game on Friday. Until Tuesday, BC had not dropped four straight in 10 years.
The Eagles’ task was not made easier with the scratch of starting sophomore goaltender Thatcher Demko, who was out with a fever. In his place, Barone made his fifth collegiate appearance and first start. Eagles coach Jerry York praised Barone for a strong debut and credited Harvard for the upset.
“They’re not an easy out for anybody,” York said. “They’re going to have a good club. I don’t care where they were picked in the ECAC [preseason polls].”
York saw improvements in Harvard’s speed and skill. For Donato, the win is a sign of more improvement to come.
“This year, the guys really committed to getting stronger,” Donato said. “I really like the attitude of the team. We have a long way to go, but the attitude is something that will allow the team to improve.”

Annenberg, the good old freshman dining hall, serves as much more than a place to eat. Freshman week, it was a place to make friends (whose names you don’t even remember anymore). Now, it’s a place to spend three hours because you keep running into people and you really don’t want to do start that Expos paper. Annenberg is a microcosm of everything that is freshman year—and it’s a jungle out there. Here is a convenient guide to the types of people you will run into:
The Celebrity
This person can't walk three feet without stopping to talk to someone. We get it, you're popular, but nobody has that many friends. Please, no one wants to wait an hour to find a table just because you need to catch up with that girl you met at the Owl last weekend.
The Facebook Celebrity
Sort of like The Celebrity, but the opposite. They may not know everyone, but everyone knows them. You’ve been Facebook friends with them for months but have never spoken. You feel uncomfortably familiar with their life story for someone you’ve never met, but then again, so do the 1665 other people in the Class of 2018 Facebook group.
The Ex-Hookup
You’re still not really clear on what the protocol is here. Make eye contact? Pretend not to recognize them? Stop and say hi? Yeah, probably not. But maybe it’s not them. It was super dark on the dance floor Friday night. It’s totally not them. Wait, yes it is, and you totally were just staring at them for like, two straight minutes. Ugh.
The Annen-buddy
You’re not sure if this person has been following you for months or you two just have very similar schedules, but either way, you somehow are always in Annenberg at the same time. You’ve never met them and aren’t entirely sure that they exist outside of the ‘berg, because whenever you try describing them to your friends no one knows who you’re talking about.
The Tourist
Also not a Harvard student, but they did sneak in behind you when you walked in. No, don’t worry, that “No Trespassing” sign definitely doesn’t apply to you, random stranger! Now they’re clustered at the door, trying to take pictures while simultaneously pretending to not understand the HUDS staffer telling them to please leave.
The Beautiful Stranger
You two made eye contact at the panini maker, and maybe your hands even brushed when you handed them the serving tongs for the fries. Who are they? Why don’t you know them? A beautiful future that ends with adjacent beds at the nursing home flashes before your eyes, but while you’re trying to figure out a socially acceptable way to start a conversation, they’ve already disappeared.
The Familiar Face
They smiled at you as you walked over to the salad bar. Uh-oh. They totally look familiar but you have no idea what their name is or where you might have met them. Oh god, they're walking toward you. Act casual. You awkwardly fixate on your glass of water and hope they don't notice you hiding behind the basket of bananas. They totally do.
The Athlete
Also known as "The Athletic Clique" because you’ll never see this person in Annenberg without a table full of their teammates. You make the mistake of sitting with this person once, but then quickly remember you don't know anything about sports in general, much less the score of this week’s game. You concede defeat, awkwardly bus your tray, and make a mental note to maybe work out sometime this semester.
The HUDS Staffer
They're nice, friendly, and always happy to help. Whether you’ve forgotten your ID for the fourth time in one week or are running into the ‘berg right before closing time, you can count on a smile from HUDS!

Taylor Swift is just as famous for her high-profile heartbreaks as her songs: Joe Jonas, Harry Styles, and Jake Gyllenhaal have all inspired tracks on her last album. But in the wake of releasing her most recent album, 1989, it looks like T-Swift is going through another breakup—with Spotify.
Last Monday, our favorite country-turned-pop superstar pulled all of her music off of the streaming site, ostensibly to not embarrass any “superfan[s]” who want to buy her albums.
Quite frankly, this is tragic. Now what are we supposed to play at our pregames? What will be the new soundtrack to our breakups? If I listen to Taylor Swift when I’m sad, what do I do when I’m sad about not being able to listen to Taylor Swift?
So listen up, Taylor, we get it. You’ve made your point about the value of music, and you’ve already made plenty of money off of 1989. But we aren’t trying to scam you out of royalties, we just want to be able to dance to “Shake it Off” without giving up $1.29 better spent on half of a Felipe’s burrito, one fifteenth of a handle of Rubinoff, or one two hundredth of Principles of Economics. Please, for the sake of broke college students everywhere, come back to Spotify.

Happy Wednesday, Harvard! If you’re a sophomore, plan of study forms are due to the Registrar’s Office (20 Garden St) by 5 p.m. Declaring a concentration seems like a massive yet kind of anticlimactic moment—somehow printing out a form and having it signed by a tutor doesn’t give the moment the gravity it deserves. Or any gravity at all. We would have liked something a little more ceremonial to make everything official. I guess we'll just settle for the free cake in the dhalls instead. We hope you got some cake and were able to declare the concentration you wanted to! No matter what it was, we’re sure it’ll serve you equally well in your future work in finance or consulting.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today will be almost as beautiful as yesterday, with a high of 60 degrees and only a 20% chance of rain. It’ll be cloudier in the morning, but we should see some sunshine by the afternoon!

2) Between Classes, Students Celebrate Veteran’s Day: rom commemorative tours to church services and stadium runs, Harvard affiliates found their own ways to honor veterans Tuesday. Though the University—which boasts one of the top numbers of alumni who have earned Medals of Honor—recognizes Veterans Day as a University holiday and many offices were closed, Harvard remained open for classes.
3) For Allston Homeowners, Alleged Home Damage Remains Unresolved: Residents of Franklin Street in Allston demanded a response from Harvard at a recent Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting regarding alleged damage to their homes caused by construction on a nearby University-owned plot of land. Homeowners claimed that vibrations from the site led to structural cracks in their homes, despite the fact that an investigation performed by the Harvard-hired developer did not find vibrations strong enough to cause structural damage.
