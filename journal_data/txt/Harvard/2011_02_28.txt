After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As you mount the stairs to enter the Art Institute of Chicago’s European Painting collection, you see before you—beyond the tall glass doors on the landing—Georges Seurat’s large canvas “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Grande Jatte.” The afternoon scene, cut alternately by sunlight and shadow, shimmers with a luminosity that surpasses even the Monets and Renoirs that hang nearby. As you near the canvas, captivated by its color, its image starts to collapse. Each recognizable figure, when seen from afar, dissolves into a multitude of small, point-like applications of paint.
In John Hughes’s “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” Ferris, his girlfriend, and his friend Cameron skip school and spend a day in Chicago, eventually finding their way to the Art Institute. In one scene, Cameron stands before the Seurat, gazing at a small girl in the middle of the frame, as the camera alternately cuts between his eyes and the canvas. At each successive cut, the camera zooms in more and more, until we are left with a final cut between a close-up of Cameron’s eyes and one of the constituent dots on the pointillist canvas.
In his commentary on the scene, Hughes says that he sees pointillism as a metaphor for Cameron’s life. Hughes comments: “The closer he looks at the child, the less he sees ... The more he looks at it, there’s nothing there. He fears that the more you look at him the less you see. There isn’t anything there.”
Is there really “nothing there?” Does a pointillist canvas, examined from a close distance, devolve into a metaphysical morass?
Pointillism, primarily developed by Seurat in the mid-1880s in France, made a science out of Impressionism’s attention to light. In fact, the pointillist technique can be traced back to a scientific textbook from 1881, Ogden Rood’s “Students’ Text-book of Color; or, Modern Chromatics, with Applications to Art and Industry.” Rood engages in a discussion of the difference in effects of mixing colors’ pigments and mixing their rays of light. He suggests a method for painters:
“We refer to the custom of placing a quantity of small dots of two colours very near each other, and allowing them to be blended by the eye placed at the proper distance ... The results obtained in this way are true mixtures of coloured light ... This method is almost the only practical one at the disposal of the artist whereby he can actually mix, not pigments, but masses of coloured light.”
The way this passage prefigures Seurat’s innovations is astounding: phrases such as “small dots,” “blended by the eye,” and “true mixtures of coloured light” precisely constitute the lexicon one brings to pointillism. We can read pointillism as an attempt to use Rood’s theory to paint solely by this mode of color combination. Felix Fénéon, an early champion of Seurat, is highly attentive to this. “These colors, isolated on the canvas, recombine on the retina: we have, therefore, not a mixture of material colors (pigments), but a mixture of differently colored rays of light,” he writes. The paint becomes the means of light, which is the sole medium of the composition. Rood’s reductive scientific model of “dots” is literalized onto Seurat’s canvas, as the artist endeavors to paint purely with light.
Looking at a Seurat puts us in an uncomfortable position. There is an unending competition in his canvases between the painting’s pictorial subject and the technique of the painting. The subject of “La Grande Jatte” clears into an intelligible image only when we are at a sufficient distance to allow the rays of light from the canvas to mix on our retinas. When we move up to the canvas, the intelligibility of the subject dissolves, but the technique—as we discern the disparate dots—becomes intelligible. Stepping back again, we undergo a complete change in our vocabulary for processing the visual data. “Dots” and “systems” are no longer relevant; we think in traditional terms of “lines,” “figure,” “composition.” Confronting a Seurat, we can choose between examining the technique or the painting’s pictorial subject, but never both.
In Seurat, we find a figure for the dichotomy we face in our modern lives. In a world composed of particles that strictly obey precise mathematical laws, the guiding forces in our lives and in our art—love, regret, melancholy—seem to dissolve. We can see our own lives either at an artistic distance, or with a scientific scrutiny. Art and science in Seurat are like two banks of the same river, forever facing one another, though separated by the river’s width. And we Parisians can only ever choose one bank on which to spend our leisurely Sunday afternoon.
I remember as a child going to the Art Institute with my parents, and standing captivated before the canvas. Pressing in closer, I watched the colors collapse into their separate points. A new world of meaning exploded in front of me. Hughes sees “nothing there.” I think I saw nothing too, but a different kind of nothingness, the kind in the end of Wallace Steven’s “The Snow Man”:
For the listener, who listens in the snow,
And, nothing himself, beholds
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.

“It might be easier than touring Afghanistan, but it is definitely more difficult than touring in most parts of the world,” said Federico Cortese, music director of the Harvard -Radcliffe Orchestra (HRO), when asked about the logistics of planning a performance tour to Cuba. Every few years the HRO goes on an international summer tour. This year they will depart for a one-week visit to Cuba immediately after commencement.
Cuba seems a particularly significant tour destination this year—it is the country of choice not only for the HRO, but also for the New York Philharmonic. As a student orchestra, the HRO stresses the distinctly collaborative nature of its performance tour. “[The New York Philharmonic’s] purpose is different from ours. We’re working more with students, we’re an educational institution. But seeing that we both got our licenses approved, obviously the government saw merit in both our projects. It seems that they’re much more focused on music and cultural communications, and we’re more focused on students,” said Bran S. Shim ’14, one of HRO’s publicity managers.
With this objective in mind, HRO members are traveling not only as musicians, but as representatives of Harvard University. “Although [the tour] is not an official trip of Harvard University, [we] are choosing to go to Cuba and perform and collaborate. I think it’s a very strong statement because Harvard carries an enormous aura and weight. I do think Cubans will pay attention to that,” said Cortese. In addition, the orchestra wished to have a culturally significant visit. “When the administration was deciding where we were going to go on tour, one thing we had in common for our ideas is that we wanted it to be a culturally and musically significant experience ... it becomes a tour not for the sake of vacation,” said Y. Diana Tsen ’11, head of the Tour Committee and President Emeritus.
A performance tour to Cuba was not an easy one to plan, both logistically and musically. “I guess you can say we picked one of the more challenging places to go on tour,” said Tsen. Because the U.S. does not have diplomatic relations with Cuba, the orchestra had to receive approval from the U.S. Department of the Treasury in order to travel. “Until we received the license from the government, we legally were not allowed to make arrangements on the ground,” said Tsen.
Cortese’s challenge as music director was to select the tour’s repertoire. The orchestra will play two different programs on the week-long tour. The first program will include Antonin Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9, the “New World Symphony,” and—tentatively—Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 with the HRO’s 2010 James Yannatos Concerto Competition Winner, pianist Y. Damon Meng ’13. “Dvorak’s New World Symphony is a perfect piece for an American symphony to play abroad because of the special place it holds in American history,” Cortese said.
The second program will consist solely of Ludwig van Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9, a monumental work that requires both an orchestra and a choir. Because the symphony requires a large orchestra and chorus, the HRO hopes to collaborate with local Cuban singers. “Beethoven’s Ninth—although not necessarily what Beethoven wanted or meant—has become a beacon of freedom and hope for mankind, of peace. It has always played a very substantial role in music repertoire ... [it was] not by accident that it was [performed] in ’89 when the Berlin Wall fell,” said Cortese.
Invigorated by these developing plans, the HRO has organized a fundraising concert for their international tour on Friday, March 4 at Sanders Theatre. The performance will feature Igor Stravinsky’s “Firebird Suite,” as well as Tchaikovsy’s “Romeo and Juliet, Fantasy Overture” and his Piano Concerto No. 1 with Meng. Under the baton of Cortese, HRO’s musicians hope to take Havana by storm.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: MAR. 28, 2011
The Feb. 28 article "HRO's Cuban Summer" misquoted Y. Diana Tsen '11 as saying that the trip to Cuba would both a tour and a vacation when, in fact, she said that the tour would be "not for the sake of vacation."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday, international superstar Shakira graced the audience of Sanders Theatre with a few lines from her hit song, “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa).” As the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ 2011 Artist of the Year, Shakira received her award during the 26th Annual Cultural Rhythms showcase: a full-day ethnic celebration featuring student performers in two shows on Harvard’s biggest stage.
12 Harvard student groups shared the stage with Shakira during the afternoon show, and the evening show—hosted by Byron T. Lichtenstein ’11 and Mya L. Thompson ’11—featured another 16, including the Harvard Breakers, the Harvard Philippine Forum, and the Holoiuma ’o Hawaii. In keeping with the celebration of cultural diversity, the Cultural Rhythms Food Festival was held in the Science Center between the two performances. The festival featured traditional ethnic cuisines, ranging from Chinese to Nigerian, prepared by 20 of the college’s cultural groups.
This year’s Cultural Rhythms showcase extended its celebration to host a total of 28 student groups, the largest body of performers yet. “We have more groups participating than ever before. I think it really speaks to the proliferation of cultural artistic expression and how it is increasingly important. Cultural Rhythms not only honors the Artist of the Year, but also gives groups who don’t often have much exposure on Harvard’s campus to perform on the Sanders stage,” said Jessica M. Ch’ng ’12, co-director of the afternoon show.
In their extensive selection process for Artist of the Year, members of the Harvard Foundation found Shakira’s long-time humanitarian efforts and incredible success in the music business exemplary. “She combines the creative quality and, importantly, the humanitarian aspect of the honor, which truly speaks to the spirit that we look for in an Artist of the Year,” said Olamide E. Oladipo ’12, the other co-director of the afternoon show.
Graciously assuming the role of Master of Ceremonies, Shakira praised the afternoon’s performers and chatted with two members of each group between acts; she asked about their costumes, their hometowns, and their background in dancing or singing. After the Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble’s performance, Shakira talked choreography with the student dancers; because Colombian culture is influenced by African culture, she said, many movements from their dance looked very familiar to her. At the request of the audience, Shakira gave a small performance of her own, singing the chorus of “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)” a cappella after the first performance by the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team.
Although Shakira was a thoroughly amusing emcee, she engaged in more than performance formalities. The reasons for Harvard Foundation’s selection became clear as she spoke passionately about the value of universal primary education, especially for youth in developing nations. “It’s not every day that I’m presented with an opportunity to speak to the people who will soon plant relevant ideas in the hearts and minds of generations to come,” said Shakira at the beginning of her speech. Throughout, she stressed the importance of inspiring younger generations to drive a continuous commitment to international social justice.
Shakira, like too few of her contemporaries, uses her voice both for hit singles and advocacy. Indeed, her dedication to education and basic rights for children in the developing world brings a notable facet to her artistry. Reaching out to Harvard’s students, she said, “In the end, you are the people that are going to have the power to make universal education a reality. You will be the policy makers, the business leaders, and the educators, and become extremely influential to the order of the world.” With this acknowledgement, she left the audience with a final request: “Can you help the rest of us make a more just society through your practices?”

On March 2, the University Place Gallery at 124 Mt. Auburn Street will open its newest exhibition. The show, which will be on display until March 31, is titled “Growth and Decay,” and will feature work by artists Sarah Meyers Brent, Jodi Colella, and Sirarpi Heghinian Walzer. Using an array of varied media and techniques, the artists’ works explore the themes of duality, birth, and disintegration. As the title “Growth and Decay” might suggest, materials play a prominent role in their creations; beyond the traditional paint and canvas, the works are composed of organic, crumbling, and self-replicating objects.
Sarah Meyers Brent, the artist who organized the collaboration for “Growth and Decay,” seems to focus particularly on the diversity of her media. Her pieces combine splotches of paint and dirt, as well as flowers wired directly to the canvas, drooping down past its edges. “I believe in material, I believe in having things that are tangible to look at,” says Brent. Life forms grow out of the frames and refute the idea of the canvas as a contained space. While suggesting movement and warmth, these organic forms also convey the ugliness present in nature’s chaos.
Jodi Colella also explores the relationship between material and growth by crafting sculptures that take on the character of living organisms. Her pieces incorporate items found in Home Depot and junkyards; they often employ textiles, such as the woolen balls she creates called ‘seeds.’ In her immense project “One Day,” Colella knits together plastic wrappings from newspapers to create an imperturbable monolithic sphere. Colella, who has a background in biology, also draws inspiration from scientifically-inspired patterns and materials. “I like rust,” Colella says. “It will change the overall structure of the thing you are working on; it never stops oxidizing.” Her piece “Undercurrent,” made of an aluminum window screen, resembles a tapestry of intracellular fluid. Like the dualities present in nature, the piece is simultaneously solid yet permeable, alluring yet painful. “It looks like gossamer, yet when you touch it, it hurts,” says Colella.
The works of Armenian-born Sirarpi Heghinian Walzer add an element of psychological depth to the exhibit—several of her abstract paintings and collages concern human experience and emotion. One of her works featured in the show is a painting titled “Memory of New Orleans,” a reflection on Hurricane Katrina. In it, the white silhouette of a person stands forward, looking away from a deluge of turquoise. The colors are not maudlin, but emanate almost furiously, conveying an ineffable consternation and the necessity of reorientation, both mental and literal—the complete restructuring of one’s own home and life. “It shows the feeling of leaving everything behind,” says Walzer. If one looks closely, one will notice that the canvas is actually slightly disheveled, with bits of fabric peeling off in places. Furthering the sense of decay, Walzer often incorporates decades-old paper into her projects.
According to Walzer, “when we are painting, our unconscious comes to the surface.” Her works tend to be distillations of childhood and memory, focusing on periods of growth in which experience evolves and reorganizes. Walzer’s paintings have been informed by the stories of those around her, such as her daughter’s volunteer experiences in New Orleans and her father’s accounts of the Armenian genocide.
In their collaboration, the three artists of “Growth and Decay” have created a collection of complementary works which explore nature’s perpetual cycles of renewal, degeneration, and at times, devastation. In describing the artistic representation of these dualities, Brent explains that “something isn’t going to look vivid unless paired with its opposite.” In these pairings, the show explores the dynamic transmutations of nature, investigating the interaction between material and subject, science and art.

The professional art world necessarily functions by a principle of exclusion. Though the line between professional and amateur art may be a fine one, the politics of galleries and exhibitions magnify that line until the distinctions appear to be clear and intrinsic. In a February 24 talk at the Carpenter Center, New York-based artist Gregory Sholette discussed his theory of artistic “dark matter,” the vast creative output produced by hobbyists and amateurs which will never grace the walls of a gallery. According to Sholette, also Visiting Assistant Professor of Visual and Environmental Studies, the professional art world is dependent upon the excess of amateur art lying just outside its boundaries.
Sholette borrows the idea of “dark matter” from modern astrophysicists “who,” he said, “basically make a point that most of the universe is invisible. It’s made of some unknown material, but without it, the universe would actually fly apart.” With this metaphor he characterizes the state of the professional art world: without the critical mass of artwork provided by unacknowledged amateurs, whose art is labeled “redundant,” professional art could not exist. Such a direct dependence follows from its exclusionary nature. “Why do we need those gatekeepers of the art world to tell us what we’re doing is interesting?” Sholette asked. “What we have is an excess that museums would never be able to recognize. Otherwise, the very concept of valorization in art would collapse.”
This situation has been complicated by the intrusion of modern technologies like the internet, which present new channels of dissemination and visibility for historically marginalized artists. “In part due to these new technologies, the dark matter is spilling out,” he said. In this way, though still perhaps amateur in quality, art which was previously obscure is able to reach a wider audience.
Fittingly, Sholette has made a career of exhibiting historically underrepresented perspectives through his artwork. After beginning his career in an East Village artists’ collective that spurned the gallery world for guerilla tactics, Sholette began executing public art projects that more closely resembled political demonstrations than painted canvases. “Part of it was around history and representation, part of it was around issues of class,” he said. One of his projects entailed making signs and placing them around New York. The signs didactically presented forgotten or suppressed historical information relating to issues of racism, sexism, and the woes of capitalism. “Our idea was to be the ‘repo men’ and the ‘repo women’ of history’s forgotten, and go around and steal back those histories and put them back up in public places.”
Sholette’s public art projects were met with particular interest by the audience, eliciting several questions during the question-and-answer session. After the talk, audience member Zhonghe Li expressed her approval of Sholette’s work. “I wasn’t sure whether I was going to come to the event, but I’m really happy I did. I feel like I have a better understanding of what public art is,” she said. David Rodowick, Department Chair of Visual and Environmental Studies and Interim Director of the Carpenter Center, offered a perspective as to why Sholette’s work and ideas are particularly resonant. “Lots of students are interested in public art these days, and I think Greg engages with some very important questions about it. What is public, for example? What is a ‘public place?’ Is it public before the introduction of public art, or after?” Rodowick admires the “blurry line” between Sholette’s art and political activism, which suggests that any protest can be reinterpreted as a creative act.
Blurring lines and overcoming exclusionary boundaries are crucial parts of Sholette’s work, both as an artist and a theorist. However, he makes it clear that he is not interested in serving as an advocate for amateur art: “I don’t want to drag the dark matter into the light; I want to drag the light into the dark matter. I’m more interested in shaking up the real estate of the art world.” Ever the artistic muckraker, Sholette seeks to highlight, criticize, and ultimately change the structure of the professional art world through his words and works.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Randall Kennedy wrote in his introduction to Werner Sollors’s and Caldwell Titcomb’s Blacks at Harvard: “Ambivalence is the word that best captures the way in which most African-American students, professors, administrators, guests, and alumni seem to have perceived, and reacted to, Harvard.” Some experiences have been positive; others have been negative, and, as usual, it is nearly impossible to make a generalization.
First, however, Harvard’s particular relationship with slavery is not to be overlooked. University President Benjamin Wadsworth, class of 1690, brought a male slave with him when he arrived at Harvard in 1725, and the following year bought a 20-year old female slave in Boston. Through the Harvard Botanical Garden, Harvard was involved with the Soledad plantation near Cienfuegos, Cuba beginning in 1910 until the Cuban Revolution, where supposedly Harvard faculty came into contact with slaves on the plantation. Elmwood, the house where University President Drew G. Faust resides, is even thought to have been built with money generated from estates in Antigua, according to Andrew Schlesinger’s history of Harvard.
However, African-Americans did not quite become a presence at Harvard until after the Civil War. Although Harvard’s long history is rife with moments of institutionalized racism, it should be said that, on the whole, the experience of the African-American at Harvard was much better than in other areas in American society of the day. As W.E.B. Du Bois—who graduated from the College in 1888 and became the first African-American to earn a Ph.D. from the University in 1895—put it, “sometimes the shadow of insult fell,” but, all in all, many more seem to agree with Richard Greener, the first African-American ever to graduate from Harvard College. “One test” applied to all Harvard students, Greener maintained: “Ability, character, and merit—these are the sole passports to her favor.”
Several controversies exploded in the subsequent generations, and The Crimson bore witness to all of them. For one, in 1922, President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, decreed that black students would not be allowed to live in freshman dormitories with their white counterparts. “We have felt from the beginning the necessity of not including colored men,” he said. The following year, however, the Board of Overseers overruled Lowell’s decision, and black and white students could live together in freshman dormitories. However, in overturning Lowell’s decision, the Board also maintained that “in the application of this rule, men of the white and colored races shall not be compelled to live and eat together.” Clearly, prejudice still prevailed. A few years later, The Crimson responded to these concerns in a piece entitled “The College Negro,” which insisted that Harvard pay more attention to excluded African-Americans.
During the era of Civil Rights, even more tension arose on Harvard’s community as a result of the sea-changes in the national perception of race relations. In 1963, a contingent of students attempted to create the Association of African and Afro-American Students, which was controversial because of its implicit reliance on a racial prejudice of its own that excluded non-blacks and non-Africans. Herbert H. Denton Jr., a member of The Crimson’s editorial board, meditated on this exclusivity in a piece we have reprinted here. After several appearances on campus of Malcolm X and the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., there was a general sentiment among Harvard’s black students that pushed for the creation of an “Afro-American Studies Department.” After the efforts of the Rosovsky Committee, this area of study was eventually established on campus.
Given recent embarrassments such as the “Quad Incident of 2007,” in which Harvard students called the authorities on a group of black Harvard students gathered on the Quad lawn—and the Boston nightclub incident that turned away black Harvard and Yale graduates after last year’s “Game”—the Harvard community has not escaped racial prejudice entirely, and we hope there will be a day in the future when such will be the case. In the meantime, however, we invite you to celebrate with us the rich tradition of African-American history at Harvard.

Organizations all have identities. Right or wrong, we have associations with institutions that we see, and those associations grow stronger when the basis on which we see an institution’s product is daily in nature. The Crimson was no different for me upon arriving at Harvard. Its reputation and identity, along with my thirst for an immersive journalism experience, was why I joined. In many ways it was everything I expected. Some things surprised me.
For other people, The Crimson had a reputation for being homogenous. They were in part correct. Harvard is an institution that fills its guidebooks and promotional literature with statistics about its expansive diversity, but our own pitch had for a long time been forced to steer clear of a discussion of demographics. Part of that had to do with the strong and well-run campus organizations that directly catered to certain groups based upon a shared cultural identity. But part of it had to do with the fact that people saw things one way and assumed that that’s the way they had always been.
But that’s not the way they always had to be. Upon my election as The Crimson’s first black president in five decades, there was much looking backward—at what had transpired over that time, the changes in the makeup of the organization, and some of the other barriers that were broken. My focus, however, was on what I could do for the paper’s future.
Our past efforts to increase The Crimson’s racial diversity had been based on socio-economics—the belief that creating policies to attract a greater variance of students from different socio-economic brackets would result in a more diverse racial makeup. Regardless of whether those efforts worked in changing the complexion of The Crimson, it was and still is one of the paper’s most notable endeavors, and a source of aid that sets us apart from other large college newspapers. The reality, though, was that racial shifts were small. My conversations with many of my black peers made clear that some people didn’t feel like The Crimson was a welcoming place for them. I intended to change that.
I aimed to speak directly to groups on campus that tailored to specific cultural identities or interests. This was the hallmark of recruitment by many groups on campus and something that I’d seen result in some success from my predecessors. But my own involvement in the very organizations that I intended to target gave me the best tools to help bring them to The Crimson. I wanted to have more intimate conversations, too, and I spoke with countless students, in groups big and large, about why our home could be theirs, too. We held events at The Crimson in conjunction with some of the large black campus groups, sponsored celebrations and discussions, and I personally tried to engage the paper in some of the most prominent conversations about race on campus beyond our reporting of those issues.
By the time my year was done, the reality was that The Crimson as a whole didn’t look all that different than it did before I got there. But what I did notice what that some of our most prominent and hard-working leaders began to more accurately represent the makeup of the College. Though we maintained and took great pride in our independence from Harvard every day, I wanted us to look more like Harvard. When my time at The Crimson was finished, I think it did.
More than three years after the beginning of my tenure as president, though, it’s worthwhile to ask: What, if anything, has changed in the long-term? What needed to change? What long-term effect did my race have on an institution that has been around almost 140 years? Especially in an institution where the leadership changes every year, were there any lasting effects of my presence?
The Crimson is certainly more representative of the University than it was even a decade before, but as more time separates me from my tenure, I realize that it probably has little to do with me. I devoted significant time to broadly trying to increase black recruitment to the organization, and while there are more black editors than in my early years, there are more Hispanic editors, Indian editors, and Muslim editors, too. The paper’s changes are much more likely the result of the cumulative effect of a series of small changes over a number of years than it is the leadership of one man over the course of single year.
And in some ways, I’m proud of that. It tells me that it doesn’t take specific recruitment efforts or fundamental institutional changes to become a more inclusive institution. It tells me that The Crimson is bigger than any one of its editors. It tells me that factors much bigger than a newspaper—be they from the University or the broader society or some other source—are working in our favor.
And it also tells me that we probably won’t have to wait another 50 years for a black president.
Malcom A. Glenn ’09 was the president of The Crimson in 2008 and the organization’s first black president in half a century.

In the wake of a Feb. 17 Crimson article about mental health and a struggle with suicidal thoughts, one Harvard student has launched an effort to foster dialogue about issues of depression on campus.
After reading the comments to “I Am Fine,” an anonymous author’s examination of a painful struggle with suicide and depression while enrolled at Harvard, Hemali A. Thakkar ’11 created a Google Group—an online forum—to facilitate discussion on this issue.
“I think it is critical to take action and have the student body leverage the attention that this moment has created,” Thakkar said.
Her group—HarvardBeWell—is a student-led initiative that plans to come up with creative ideas to address mental health issues. It has a membership of 10 Harvard students since it was founded six days ago.
The article, which ran anonymously, has received an outpouring of comments on The Crimson’s website, and has garnered over one thousand “likes” on Facebook.
Some comments thank the author’s bravery in speaking on a highly personal issue. Others have shared their own stories of struggling with similar problems. Comments call for “keeping the conversation going” and “having an open dialogue for mental health issues at Harvard.”
The Student Mental Health Liaisons, an undergraduate organization that works to promote a supportive Harvard community and reach out to students struggling with mental health issues, is also working hard to make the most of current interest in the issue.
Their website, HarvardSmiles.com, includes an information portal for students to easily access and communicate with one another about wellness issues and has received thousands of unique visits over the last 12 days.
Seth A. Riddley ’12, a mental health liaison and contributor to HarvardSmiles.com, said he hopes that the website can serve as a tool to raise awareness about mental health issues.
“We hope the website will be a forum for the whole community and that it connects students with resources available to them on campus,” he said.
Paul J. Barreira, director of behavioral health and academic counseling for University Health Services, strongly endorses these types of activities, which he said can contribute to a culture of seeking help for mental health issues.
Barreira added that he is encouraged by an increase in student visits to the various mental health services available on campus in the last year, which he says has been positively influenced by student workshops and freshmen outreach programs that UHS and The Bureau of Study Council have put in place.
Still, Barreira acknowledges that there is a lot of work to be done.
“I’d like to see a change in the culture—more open-minded discussions, and more students involved in promoting tolerance and reducing fear in addressing their problems,” he said.
SMHL and student-led initiatives such as HarvardBeWell are promising to Barreira.
“At the end of the day, any vehicle for students to communicate and see what’s available to them is terrific.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Career Services held the second-annual Energy and Environment Expo last Friday, offering students the opportunity to speak with representatives from a variety of venture capital firms, start-up companies, and volunteer organizations.
The event, held in the Radcliffe Gym, featured over 30 exhibitions of new products and technologies ranging from drought-tolerant grass seed to sustainable, LED flat panel lights.
Focusing on research and nonprofit work, the event stood in contrast to some OCS-sponsored events that have directed students towards careers in business management and finance.
While Friday’s event was open to all Harvard students, a majority of those in attendance were seniors or graduate students, according to OCS Director Robin Mount, who noted that there were a number of Business School students interested in the business side of energy.
Inspired by the All Ivy Environmental and Sustainable Development Career Fair held annually at Columbia University, OCS administrators Anthony J. Arcieri and Scott LaChapelle organized the first event last year.
“We wanted our own event to promote interest in environmental and energy opportunities,” Arcieri said. “We decided on an event that was less of a career fair and more of an exposition.”
LaChappelle said he was satisfied with both the number of companies who had agreed to participate and the variety of career paths that they offered students.
But Samuel H. Rashba ’14 and Gabriel Trevino ’14 said they were slightly disappointed in the lack of opportunities available for freshmen.
“It seemed really more geared towards graduate students,” Trevino said, “but it was interesting nonetheless.”
Event organizers estimated the turnout was at least as good as last year’s, with over 100 students attending.
Some students said they were pleased with the variety of companies present.
“They’re here to help students turn the skills they learn in the classroom into jobs and careers in the real world,” Akachimere C. Uzosike ’13 said. “It’s a great opportunity because energy and environmental technology are two issues that Harvard and the United States need to be leaders in.”

Harvard Psychology Professor Randy L. Buckner won the 2010 MetLife Foundation Award for Medical Research in Alzheimer’s Disease last Thursday for his research in brain imaging.
Buckner was honored at an award presentation with colleague Marcus E. Raichle, a professor of radiology and neurology at Washington University in St. Louis.
For their efforts, Buckner and Raichle each received a $200,000 research grant and a $50,000 personal award.
“I was surprised and honored to learn about the award. It was a particular pleasure to learn that I would be receiving [it] with my long-time colleague, Marcus Raichle. Marcus is the pioneer of human functional brain imaging and was my inspiration for entering the field,” Buckner said.
Buckner applies brain imaging techniques to observe the role of certain brain systems in cognition. He analyzes how brain systems help people remember and why those systems break down in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
Buckner has been studying these issues for more than 20 years, beginning as a graduate student at Washington University.
Buckner improved an imaging technique that has allowed researchers to look into the brain and observe how people form memories.
“The brain is never at rest, including our memory systems,” Buckner said. “There is a surprisingly high amount of spontaneous activity even during passive moments and sleep ... What we discovered is that the regions of the brain with the highest levels of intrinsic activity are those most vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease.”
The MetLife Foundation has awarded over $19 million for Alzheimer’s research and awareness over the last 20 years.
“He’s done some very important work,” said Harvard Psychology Professor Daniel L. Schacter. “It’s good news for everybody in the psychology department.”
In a Feb. 24 press release, MetLife CEO C. Robert Henrikson said, “We salute two outstanding scientists who take their place among a leading group of researchers recognized for developing methods to combat and, perhaps someday, prevent Alzheimer’s disease from impacting future generations.
“There’s so much more work to be done,” Buckner said, “I feel like we are just getting started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before an audience of about 20 students gathered in Sever Hall, Kavita N. Ramdas, former president and CEO of the Global Fund for Women, argued that injustices towards women continue to affect women, even in the developed world.
“There’s the implicit assumption that challenges to women rights are to be found in ‘other parts’ of the world,” Ramdas said at the event on Saturday, which was organized by the Women Leadership Project in conjunction with the Harvard Law School and the Institute of Politics.
But those issues are felt in the U.S. as well. As a member of the Board of Trustees at her alma mater, Princeton University, Ramdas said she was surprised to discover a significant drop in the number of leadership positions held by women at elite universities and a shortage of women candidates for scholarships such as the Rhodes.
During the event, Ramdas discussed the successes and failures of the feminist movement throughout the world, including China, India, and Kosovo, as well as on college campuses across the U.S.
She said issues like female genital mutilation, arranged marriages, and female illiteracy continue to harm women throughout the developing world. But, Ramdas said, while the developed world may want to combat these issues, organizations must avoid “patronizing” local cultures in an attempt to fix a world they may not fully understand.
“Nobody wants to be saved,” she said. “So we need to start at a position of humility and acknowledge that we don’t have all the answers ourselves.”
Ramdas concluded the talk by arguing that the fight for gender justice is sometimes used to mask other agendas.
“Even Exxon Mobil is for women rights,” she said. “We must remember to be suspicious whenever we hear ‘This is for women rights.’”
The small group of attendees responded well to Ramdas’ speech and message.
“She’s an incredible speaker and woman,” said Paul A. Leroux ’14. “Everything she said about our role in world issues can be applied to not just the feminist movement but the global society in general.”
In response to Ramdas’ concern about gender issues on college campuses, Samantha R. Rosekrans ’11, a board member of the Women Leadership Project, said she thought the male-dominated final clubs on campus were indicative of a problem at Harvard.
“We subscribe to an archaic tradition of gender dichotomy that’s still very pervasive in campus life,” she said.

There is no historical precedent for cutting global health funding during times of economic crisis, according to a study released one day after the U.S. House Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor defended such cuts at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
David Stuckler, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, coauthored the study, “Does Recession Reduce Global Health Aid? Evidence from 15 High-Income Countries, 1975-2007.”
According to Stuckler, the study originated from concerns that the U.S. and other countries would cut their global aid budgets in response to the financial crisis.
The study found that while some countries scaled back their foreign aid during recessions, other countries, such as Australia and Germany, made commitments to increase funding,
“There are better ways to finance recovery than by cutting vital support to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable groups,” Stuckler said. “The U.S. greatly benefits from investing in global health because it improves security and economic growth.”
“It’s a win-win situation—and part of the reason why President Bush began increasing these commitments in the first place.”
On Thursday night, Cantor (R.-Va.) defended cuts to global health funding as one of the sacrifices Congress must make to balance the budget.
Cantor’s speech was met by protests from the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition.
Global Health and AIDS Coalition member Krishna M. Prabhu ’11 said that while the group is now targeting Republicans, their mission is, and will always be, non-partisan.
“It’s like a tennis match—you target whoever has the ball in his court,” he said.
While Stuckler’s study supports the Global Health and AIDS Coalition’s cause from an academic and policy viewpoint, it probably won’t change the messaging the group uses, Prabhu said. He added that the group will continue to frame the issue in terms of the people who will be affected by these cuts.
“It’s not that we don’t have the money, it’s just that we don’t choose to spend the money that way,” said Lily H. Ostrer ’14. “When you look at it, health aid is less than one-fourth of 1 percent of our spending.”
Members of the Harvard Republican Club, however, maintained that this is an issue about the deficit, not about foreign aid.
“We are at an unsustainable pace of spending and there are very difficult decisions to be made with cuts. Not every cut is going to be popular,” said club Vice President Kevin R. Palmer ’13.
“Both parties need to work together to cut the size and scope of government and get us towards a balanced budget.”
But members of the Global Health and AIDS Coalition said they believe the budget can be balanced in other ways. Krishna Prabhu’s sister, Mythili Prabhu ’13, pointed to a repeal of the Bush tax cuts and other tax measures as possible sources of revenue.
At Thursday’s forum, she asked Cantor a question about the funding cuts. She said she found his response disappointing.
“We’re not satisfied, and we won’t stop asking these sorts of questions,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three months after a Boston nightclub was alleged to have engaged in racial discrimination by shutting down a private party for black Harvard and Yale graduate students and alumni, Cure Lounge has agreed to settle the complaint by paying a $30,000 fine, issuing a public apology, and sending its staff to anti-discrimination training.
According to the results of an investigation released Friday, the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office found that the club unfairly discriminated against the students and alumni by shutting down the party on grounds associated with racial discrimination.
On Nov. 20 last year, Cure Lounge’s management closed a private party attended by black Harvard and Yale graduate students because they were afraid the group would “attract the wrong crowd” and that they had seen “local gang-bangers” outside the club.
At the time, George Regan, a spokesperson for the club, said that Cure did not discriminate unfairly against its patrons. He said that the party was shut down out of a concern for safety and because event promoters had allegedly violated their contract with the club.
But the results of the investigation released Friday indicated that the disputed closing had indeed been fueled by racial discrimination.
“Massachusetts businesses cannot refuse to host events because of racial reasons,” Massachusetts Attorney General Martha M. Coakley said in a statement. “In this case, club staff made harmful and ill-conceived conclusions based on the simple fact that most of the guests were black. This type of behavior is the essence of racial stereotyping and it is a reminder that, despite the many strides we have taken, there is still progress to be made.”
Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr., who studies race and criminal justice, wrote in an e-mail that the decision by the club to settle with the Attorney General’s Office “is an appropriate ending to a tragic event.”
“Now it is time to move forward and focus on rebuilding a community of trust and respect,” Ogletree added.
In a statement on their website, the club apologized for the incident and said that “Cure Lounge does not tolerate racism.” The club added that it will “do everything in its power to ensure that the events of November 20 will not be repeated again.”
Cure also apologized for statements made by the public relations group that represented the club at the time of the incident. Regan, the club spokesperson, told The Crimson in December that he was “tired of dealing with the matter,” accused the event promoters of having an agenda, and told The Boston Globe that there were individuals in line known to police as “bad people” who “probably couldn’t spell the word ‘Harvard.’”
In addition to the fine and a public apology, Cure Lounge staffers have been ordered to attend anti-discrimination workshops.
A majority of the proceeds from the fine will be distributed to organizations that help black students seek higher education opportunities.
Amie Breton, the deputy press secretary of the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, said that her office hoped this case would be the last of its kind.
“We are hopeful that lessons will be learned from this and that there won’t be any need for us to have to go through anything like this with any of the nightclubs in Boston or Massachusetts,” Breton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Protesters in 55 cities worldwide gathered for International Walk for Choice day on Saturday in response to a number of bills introduced in Congress which could de-fund the $317 million-Title X federal aid program, which funds organizations such as Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest family planning organization.
In Boston, over 1,400 protesters rallied with signs, starting from five locations and converging in Boston Common in front of the statehouse. Harvard College and graduate students, including members of the Radcliffe Union of Students, Harvard Students for Choice, and International Women’s Rights Collective, walked with fellow students and community members to protest the House bills.
“The proposed bills will infringe upon the natural human rights of half the population in this country ... The right that all human beings have to control and care for their own bodies,” said Jessica Lockwood, one of the organizers and a representative of the International Socialist Organization, in an address to the crowd.
As part of their pro-life platform, Republicans introduced a number of bills in the past few weeks to restrict abortion services. The H.R.1 bill, passed by the House on Feb. 19, prohibits the appropriation of federal funding to “any foreign nongovernmental organization that promotes or performs abortion.” H.R.3, H.R.217, and H.R.358, which have not yet been passed, place further restrictions on public funding of abortions, permanently limiting place further restrictions on public funding of abortions, permanently limiting the funding to only cases arising from rape and incest involving a female minor. The bills would also allow hospitals to refuse to provide training or to perform abortions.
None of the bills aimed at limiting government funding for abortion have passed the Senate, which is controlled by a Democratic majority.
“The government’s attack on [women’s right to choose abortion] is an attack on women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights,” said Akanksha Sharma ’14, who participated in the walk. “We need to stand up against this.”
Neil Peterman, a Harvard graduate student who was at the rally, said, “I think [the Republican] strategy has been that they can’t take away abortion rights, but they can make it as hard as possible [to acquire an abortion], especially for poor women, working women, and women of color.”
Congressional cuts in Planned Parenthood funding would affect over 4.7 million women, including more than 3 million women at or below the federal poverty line, according to Planned Parenthood’s website.
To raise awareness about this issue on campus, the Harvard College Democrats are working with Students for Choice on a campaign for reproductive justice and access to reproductive health care. Yesterday, they launched a Tumblr site (harvardstandswithpp.tumblr.com) where students can send in photos attached with the statement “I Stand with Planned Parenthood” to show their support.
“These cuts are about Planned Parenthood, not about balancing the budget,” said Harvard College Democrats Campaigns Director Katie R. Zavadski ’13. “What these cuts are harming are women’s access to pap smears, and [Sexually Transmitted Infection] tests. We don’t think that women’s lives should be part of a political game.”
“We hope to get people to submit pictures of themselves—with Harvard affiliation—to show, ‘I care about this,’ and that we are all standing together—both men and women,” said Leah Reis-Dennis ’13, a board member of Students for Choice who also walked on Saturday.
The president of Right to Life, Harvard’s undergraduate pro-life group, declined to be interviewed yesterday.
Zavadski is currently comping The Crimson’s news board.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As pro-democracy protests and uprisings gain momentum in the Middle East, Harvard’s Government Department remains without an expert in the field of Middle Eastern political science.
The department has not had an expert in its ranks since visiting Professor Emad Shahin left in 2009, and has not had a tenured position in the field since Nadav Safran retired about 20 years ago.
The Government Department currently does not have a search in progress for a new professor, according to Government Department Chair Timothy J. Colton.
“The problem isn’t a lack of demand on our side, it’s a lack of supply,” Colton said. “There just aren’t enough people being trained to do this.”
Colton added that language barriers and the difficulty of doing research under authoritarian governments deter scholars from entering the field. The department has struggled in the past to secure scholars for both junior and senior level faculty positions.
“It’d be nice to have a few more professors considering what’s going on in the world, but I definitely don’t feel like I’m missing out,” said Colby A. Wilkason ’13, who is concentrating in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.
The Government Department has used visiting professors and graduate students with experience in Middle Eastern studies to help fill the void.
According to Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch, the department tries to provide seminars that “touch on issues relevant to Middle East politics,” such as Gov 98wd: “Islam and Secular Public Spaces” and Gov 90da: “Democracy, Alienation, and Muslims in the West.” They also direct students to courses in NELC, she said.
William E. Granara, a professor who teaches courses on Arabic language and literature in NELC, offers two courses on the modern Arab world (Arabic 162 and 170) that together span Arabic history from the Ottoman Empire to the present day.
The Government Department also tries to cross-list courses taught by Middle East expert and Harvard Kennedy School Professor Tarek Masoud, according to Welch.
Masoud, currently on sabbatical, normally offers a course at the Kennedy School called “Middle East Policy.”
While the Government Department has tried to get Masoud to teach at the College in the past, Masoud said he has not had the opportunity.
“I would love to teach students in the College, but my obligations to HKS students, and the fact that I took a research leave this year, have meant that I haven’t had a chance to do so yet,” Masoud said.
Other Middle East-focused courses include Anthropology Professor Steven Caton’s Anthropology 2690: “Middle East Ethnography: Discourse, Politics, and Culture” and Middle East History Professor E. Roger Owen’s History 1891: “Understanding the Middle East since 1945: The Basic Socio-Economic and Political Structures.” Owen also teaches a seminar titled “Debates in the Political and Ideological History of the Middle East.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s squash team (9-6, 3-3 Ivy) earned a No. 5 national ranking this weekend at the CSA National Team Championship, as 12-time defending champion Trinity (20-0, 1-0 NESCAC) reclaimed its title and extended its winning streak to 244 matches.
“We came into this tournament trying to get a top-four finish,” sophomore Alexander Ma said. “We had a tough loss to Princeton on Friday. We managed to rally back and beat Dartmouth on Saturday, and we really got our revenge [yesterday], because we lost to Cornell earlier in the season.”
HARVARD 5, CORNELL 4
Though not fighting for a national title, the Crimson had a strong showing against No. 5 Cornell in the consolation round finals of the Potter Cup division yesterday.
“The match [yesterday] was gratifying on a couple of different levels,” Way said. “When we played [Cornell] in the middle of our season, we had what was probably our worst performance at Cornell. I reminded [the team] of that, and they had to redeem themselves today.”
This weekend, the Crimson claimed retribution for the early defeat, edging the Big Red (10-5, 4-2 Ivy) by a slim margin of 5-4.
After going down 3-0 in the first cycle, Harvard was able to secure its first win at the No. 5 spot, with sophomore Zeke Scherl claiming a victory for the Crimson. Freshman Brandon McLaughlin swept his opponent to earn another win for Harvard at the No. 4 spot.
Captain Reed Endresen came back from being two games down to defeat his opponent in a five-game thriller in front of a large crowd.
“The kid has been through it...[Endresen] goes 0-2 down, he’s been sick, he has a black eye, and he’s the captain,” Way said. “The Oscars are tonight. It’s almost like the script of some bloody movie. Then, he pulls it out, and I could not be prouder of him.”
Ma also earned a key win for the Crimson. After battling the first four games to a stalemate and falling behind in the final set, the sophomore went on to win six straight points to take the No. 8 match, 11-9.
“My opponent played really well the first two games,” Ma said. “In the fifth game, I was down, 9-5. I really had to focus and claw my way back, one point at a time.”
Freshman Tommy Mullaney sealed the deal with a dominant 3-1 victory at the No. 7 spot, as the Crimson claimed fifth place in the nation for the second straight year.
HARVARD 8, DARTMOUTH 1
In its penultimate match of the weekend, Harvard defeated the No. 7 Big Green (11-6, 2-4) with a dominant showing.
“We were expected to win yesterday, but it’s never easy,” Way said. “We had to work hard for that one.”
The Crimson edged Dartmouth in games, 26-7, as Harvard earned its place in the consolation finals.
Senior Richard Hill played impressively for Harvard, defeating his opponent, 3-0, including a tight 12-10 second game.
Five Harvard players—Hill, Endresen, McLaughlin, Mullaney, and Scherl—won their matches in three games, while the Crimson dropped just one contest on the day.
PRINCETON 8, HARVARD 1
The Crimson got off to a disappointing start on Friday, as the Tigers (12-3, 5-1) won 25 sets and advanced to the second round.
“We played very well against Princeton,” Way said. “I think the score line didn’t really do justice to how well the guys played.”
Unfortunately for Harvard, the loss to the Tigers put the Crimson out of contention for the national title early on in the weekend.
Freshman McLaughlin picked up Harvard’s only victory of the day in four games, dropping the third set before securing the win in the fourth.
Mullaney, Ma, and junior William Ahmed posted strong showings, picking up two games each off of their Tiger counterpart in the only three five-game matches of the day.
Harvard ends national team championship weekend in fifth place, maintaining its national ranking from last year and moving up one spot from the most recent in-season poll, which tabbed the Crimson sixth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following its victory over Brown last week, the sixth-seeded Harvard women’s water polo team faced its two biggest challenges of the season thus far in the final two games of the annual Eastern College Athletic Conference Championship this weekend. Winning once and losing twice, the Crimson finished fourth in the eight-team tournament.
The Crimson (8-3, 2-0 CWPA) began the tournament—hosted by Bucknell in Lewisburg, Pa.—with a rematch of Wednesday night’s conference-opener against the Bears (2-5, 0-2). Harvard snagged a convincing 9-5 win over its Ivy League rivals on Saturday, but could not find the same luck in a rematch against Iona (5-2), which this time claimed a 15-14 win over the Crimson.
Yesterday afternoon, top-seeded Princeton (2-5) took down Harvard, 12-3, in a battle for third place and sent the Crimson home with more than a few lessons to learn from the weekend.
“Overall, it was a productive weekend because we learned a lot,” junior goalie Laurel McCarthy said. “You really only learn in close games. While we’ve had a lot of success early in the season, it’s definitely good to get into these close situations. It was definitely a learning weekend.”
PRINCETON 12, HARVARD 3
A hard press from the Tigers, doubled with the exhaustion of a packed schedule, allowed Harvard to stumble into an early deficit too large to overcome in its last game of the weekend.
“It just took us a while to get into the game and clicking as a team,” junior attacker Shannon Purcell said. “We had a lot of opportunities, and we just couldn’t finish them. From the second quarter on, we were able to play with them really well...[after] making the appropriate adjustments.”
Thanks to two separate 5-1 runs in the first and third quarters, Princeton used counter-attack goals to cement a solid lead over Harvard. But the Crimson did manage to take the Tigers point for point at the end of each half.
Two of Harvard’s three goals were scored with one-man advantages, but its 6-on-5 defense proved to be one of the Crimson’s weak spots in the opening stanza, as it had been for the entire weekend.
By the second quarter, Harvard water polo coach Ted Minnis and his team had stopped lumbering in man-down situations and began to attack the ball, which proved to be a valuable adjustment.
“[When we lumbered against Iona, they had] more time to shoot it and not as much pressure,” Purcell said. “But in the Princeton game, when one girl got the ball, we would hit the ball, and they couldn’t handle it. That was really effective for us.”
IONA 15, HARVARD 14
Despite falling, 17-7, to the Crimson in Harvard’s opening weekend at Blodgett Pool, Iona appeared to have brought an entirely renewed team to Lewisburg on Saturday afternoon, beating the Crimson for the first time in the schools’ histories and providing it with its tightest match of the season.
“They were a much different team from what we played when we met them the first time,” Purcell said. “They had a lot more speed than the first game, and they had a harder press, and they were countering a lot more...They had just improved a lot.”
According to McCarthy and Purcell, Harvard’s 10-goal victory over the Gaels three weeks ago lulled the Crimson into a false sense of complacency this time around, as it gave up three separate leads of four, three, and two goals.
“We let them off the hook,” McCarthy said. “We didn’t finish the game—we just let go of a pretty strong lead.”
Harvard failed to take full advantage of its 11 6-on-5 opportunities, converting only three into goals, while Iona managed to score each time it drew an ejection.
Despite limiting the Gaels’ biggest threat, junior Cecilia Leonard, to just an assist, senior Maggie Wood and junior Mackenzie Mone helped avenge the squad’s earlier loss with four goals apiece.
“They tried to work it into the center looking for kickouts,” McCarthy said. “They were pretty heavy on [Mone and Wood] down low on the posts.”
HARVARD 9, BROWN 5
Earlier that day, the Crimson cruised to another victory over Brown to open its three-game series in the tournament.
“We were the ones setting the pace of the game,” Purcell said. “It really felt like our game. We controlled this game even more [than the last time we played Brown].”
Sophomore attacker Aisha Price and junior co-captain Devan Kennifer led Harvard with three goals and three steals each, while McCarthy added 12 more saves to her season total.
Having played nine games since last Saturday, the Crimson is more than ready for its two-week break from game play. The season will pick up again on March 13 when Harvard will launch its seven-game run through California.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team split up this weekend, with roughly half the squad taking to the pool at the Ivy Championships, hosted by Princeton University, and the rest traveling to the University of Pittsburgh for the Eastern College Athletics Conference Championships.
“Our goal was to take two championships in one weekend, and it’s great because everyone on the team had a chance to compete at a conference meet,” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said.
Unfortunately for Harvard, second place was the theme for the weekend—it couldn’t beat the host Tigers, placing second at the Ancient Eight meet, while the ECAC team also finished second with 609.5 points, only 1.5 points behind winner New Hampshire.
IVY CHAMPIONSHIPS
The Class of 2011 led the way for Harvard at the Ivies, with four seniors placing in the top three of their events. Morawski was able to bring seven seniors to the meet, the largest number in her time with the Crimson.
“Every member of the team scored points, and we had some great leadership from our seniors, but we didn’t quite have enough to take down Princeton,” Morawski said.
Top among the point scorers was senior Kate Mills who, after her 117 points garnered this weekend, finished with 330 total points during her Ivy Championship career—making her the career-high point-scorer at the annual meet.
“I didn’t expect to receive the career mark with so many great swimmers out there; I’m pleased and pleasantly surprised,” the California native said.
Mills won the 400-yard individual medley, anchored the winning 800-yard freestyle relay team, came second in the 200-yard butterfly, anchored the second place 400-yard freestyle relay, and came third in the 200-yard individual medley.
Some of her biggest competition in those events came from her teammate, sophomore Laura Evans.
“Laura and Kate kept going back and forth, Laura would set a team record in the morning, and Kate would break it in the afternoon. It was great to watch,” Morawski said.
Evans came second in the 400-yard individual medley, fourth in the 200-yard individual medley, swam on the winning 800-yard freestyle relay team with Mills, and came fifth in the 200-yard backstroke.
Senior Christine Kaufman continued her long-distance prowess, with a top-three finish in the 1000-yard freestyle for the third year in a row. She added another bronze in the mile and a fifth-place finish in the 500 free.
Senior Jenny Reese came second on the one-meter diving board, and sophomore Brittany Powell came second in the three-meter.
Co-captains Ali Slack and Katie Hinkle helped round off an incredibly successful weekend for the senior class. Hinkle set a school record in the 50-yard freestyle, as the two seniors contributed 228.5 of the team’s 1,436 points.
The seniors, while disappointed at not leaving with an Ivy Championship, were emotional about their time at Harvard.
“It’s been an amazing four years, and this was a great culmination of it all,” Slack said. “We did the best we could, and it was an amazing effort by everyone. The last day was the best day, and that made me very proud.”
ECAC CHAMPIONSHIPS
Records fell as the rest of the Crimson claimed second at the ECAC Championships. Harvard’s 200-yard freestyle relay team broke the meet record with a time of 1:34.54 in the preliminaries and then lowered that record to 1:34.47 in the finals.
The Crimson 200-yard individual medley, 400-yard individual medley, and 400-yard freestyle relays each also reached the podium in second place.
“[Having to split the team in half this weekend] was a testament to the hard work the team had put in, to be able to successfully field nearly two full squads at separate events,” Morawski said.
While much of the success at the Ivies came in the lanes, Harvard swept the diving events at the ECACs, with sophomore Jessica Stanfield winning the one-meter event and junior Courtland Kelly taking the three-meter event and Diver of the Meet award.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, C.T.—With his team down by one point with 26 seconds to play, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker wanted two things: for the Crimson to hold for the last shot and for sophomore playmaker Brandyn Curry to attack the basket.
Harvard did as its coach asked. After waiting until just a few ticks remained on the clock, Curry drove hard to the paint and floated a shot at the basket.
But his last-second attempt rolled off the rim, and a stunned Crimson squad walked off the court at Yale’s John J. Lee Amphitheater in disbelief.
“Certainly a gut-wrenching loss” Amaker said. “Curry certainly did a heck of job getting that ball up there and giving it a shot to drop in but it didn’t crawl in for us....Exactly what we wanted was right there, and we just didn’t make the shot.”
Led by sophomore Austin Morgan’s 14 second-half points, the Bulldogs (14-12, 7-5 Ivy) battled back from a late deficit to hand the Crimson (21-5, 10-2) a 70-69 defeat on Saturday night.
The loss, which came one week after Harvard moved into first place in the Ivy League standings, dropped the Crimson one game behind Princeton in the loss column heading into the final weekend of conference play.
Harvard, which led by six points with 7:22 to play, failed to come up with stops down the stretch, ultimately leading to the Crimson’s demise.
Yale scored on its final four possessions while stopping Harvard on its last possession to secure the victory.
“[On the final possession], we did a pretty good job of pressing up, and then the ball got into a couple of guys’ hands that I don’t think were really ready to try to make a play,” Yale coach James Jones said. “And we were fortunate that their last shot fell a little short.”
Morgan sparked the Yale comeback, knocking down a three-pointer from the top of the key—his fourth of the half—to pull the Bulldogs within one with five minutes to play.
Sophomore Christian Webster—who finished with a game-high 22 points—kept the Crimson’s lead at three with a pair of free throws and a backdoor layup.
But a layup from Reggie Willhite and two free throws from Porter Braswell knotted the score at 66.
With 1:28 to play, Yale took its first lead in more than 10 minutes after Willhite blew past the Crimson defense and banked in a layup off the glass.
Webster answered, pulling up from the left elbow and sinking a high-arching shot, despite being fouled. Webster knocked down the free throw, putting the visitors ahead by one with 55 seconds to play.
On the ensuing possession, Willhite lobbed the ball into forward Jeremiah Kreisberg on the left block. Kreisberg finished the play, giving Yale the one-point edge. On the other end, the Crimson swung the ball to freshman Laurent Rivard near the top of the key, but the rookie’s shot was off its mark. With 30 seconds to play junior co-captain Keith Wright pulled down the offensive rebound, and Amaker signaled for a timeout.
“We certainly wanted to see if we could milk it and get the last opportunity,” Amaker said of his team’s strategy coming out of the timeout. “We wanted to see if we could get some penetration and have the ball in [Curry’s] hands to make a play. We did exactly what we wanted, except for obviously making the basket.”
While Amaker was pleased with the final shot his team came up with, the fourth-year coach was not pleased with the production he received from his frontcourt.
Wright—who entered the contest as the Crimson’s leading scorer—was held to 12 points on 3-of-12 shooting while sophomore Kyle Casey was limited physically after getting banged up in Friday’s matchup with Brown.
“We didn’t play particularly well up front for our team,” Amaker said. “Keith really struggled until the second half when he got to the foul line. Our production up front was very limited, and that really hurt us tonight.”
Yale, meanwhile, relied heavily on its frontcourt duo of Kreisberg and junior Greg Mangano to power its squad. Kreisberg notched 13 points on 6-of-8 shooting, while Mangano added 11 points, 13 rebounds, and five blocks.
“I think they are outstanding up front with Kreisberg and Mangano,” Amaker said. “They’re just very difficult to defend.”
While Mangano struggled shooting from the field in the first half, the forward managed to play solid defense on Wright, holding the Ivy League Player of the Year candidate to two points on eight shots.
With Wright’s offensive production limited, the Crimson leaned on Webster and Casey to provide the scoring. The pair combined for 22 of Harvard’s 35 first-half points, sending the Crimson into the break up by four.
But Morgan had the hot hand coming out of the intermission, sinking his first two attempts from beyond the arc to give Yale the lead.
“In the first half, I tried to be patient and let the game come to me,” Morgan said. “In the second half, I was able to take advantage of some breakdowns in the defense that the coaches noticed.”
Despite the loss, the Crimson still controls its destiny heading into its final two Ivy League matchups of the season. If Harvard can pick up a pair of victories, it will guarantee the squad at least a share of Ivy League title.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Friday night at Brown, it was like déjà vu all over again for the Harvard men’s basketball team.
On its home court exactly two weeks earlier, the Crimson had been stunned by the Bears’ 55-point first half outburst that left Harvard staring at a 22-point halftime deficit. But after an inspirational speech by coach Tommy Amaker, the Crimson came out firing on all cylinders in the second half, mounting the fourth largest comeback in NCAA history in its 85-78 win.
At home Friday evening, Brown came out hot again, shooting 57.1 percent from the field in the first period en route to a 41-30 lead. But history tends to repeat itself, and it did on Friday, as the Crimson dominated the second half again and finished off the Bears, 74-68.
“We showed our heart, there’s no question about it,” Amaker said.
The tides turned on an 18-6 Harvard run to start the second period, which pushed Harvard into the lead.
Brown started the half with two turnovers, and junior co-captain Keith Wright and sophomore Kyle Casey made the Bears pay with layups on the other end.
The teams traded baskets for a few minutes until Crimson freshman Laurent Rivard drilled a three to cut the lead to 45-41 with 14:46 to play. The Bears’ Peter Sullivan responded with a layup on the other end, but Harvard sophomore Brandyn Curry drilled a three from the top of the key to bring the Crimson within 47-44.
After two free-throws by sophomore Christian Webster cut the lead to one, junior co-captain Oliver McNally drew a charge against Brown forward Andrew McCarthy on the other end, and Casey hit a jumper over McCarthy on the next Harvard possession to give the squad its first lead since 41 seconds into the game.
Brown forward Tucker Halpern hit two free throws to give the Bears back the lead, but Wright responded with a pretty spin move and layup around McCarthy to put the Crimson back up, 50-49, with 11:30 remaining. Harvard would not lose its lead the rest of the way.
McNally had a steal on Brown’s next possession and, while racing down the court, was fouled by Bear guard Adrian Williams. McNally, realizing he had nothing to lose, threw up a shot towards the basket and it banked in. His ensuing free-throw gave the Crimson a 53-49 lead.
“I just threw it up there,” McNally said. “Fortunately, it went in.”
Harvard’s lead would get as large as eight a few minutes later after a three by freshman Matt Brown. But Halpern responded with a three of his own to bring the Bears within five, 62-57, with 6:50 to go. A McCarthy layup on the next Bears possession cut the Crimson lead to three.
A minute later, a Webster long ball from the left corner rattled in to put Harvard up six, but Halpern matched again with a fall-away three from the top of the key to make it a three-point game.
Casey responded with a long jumper, but Halpern—who was 6-9 from behind the arc—drilled another long ball to make it 67-65 Harvard with 4:01 remaining.
McCarthy missed a wide-open layup that would have tied the game on Brown’s next possession. After Casey hit one-of-two from the line and McNally made a transition layup off an outlet by Curry, the Crimson was able to pull away.
“We don’t come out of here this evening alive, with a victory, without Oliver McNally,” Amaker said. “I thought his overall performance was outstanding.”
Both teams had come out firing from long distance to open the game. Halpern started things off with a three that was matched by McNally. Freshman Sean McGonagill then hit two straight long balls to give the Bears the early 8-3 advantage in a quickly-paced half that saw each team with a lot of possessions.
A three by Brown’s Garrett Leffleman would put the Bears ahead 13-5 soon after, and later Leffleman would drive and kick it out to Halpern, who knocked down a three from the left corner to make it 25-14 Brown.
The lead would get as large as 15 after a Sullivan jumper with 3:13 left in the first period, and, after a Rivard transition three cut it to eight, Halpern responded with a long ball with Wright in his face to give the Bears an 11-point edge going into the break.
Halpern led all scorers with 29 points on 10-15 shooting, while McNally paced the Crimson with 20, to go with four assists and five steals. Wright finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds for Harvard, which shot 51.9% from the field in the second half.
“I think we believe in each other, and in ourselves as a team,” McNally said. “I’m so fortunate to play with such a talented group of guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Its early lead completely evaporated, the Crimson had eight minutes left in the fourth quarter to either make a stand or drop its season opener.
Harvard chose the former, as sophomore midfielder Jack Doyle cut from the top of the field with a step on his defender, taking a perfect pass from freshman Daniel Eipp and burying a shot in the back of the cage. Doyle’s score put his team up, 8-7, with 6:12 remaining in the fourth quarter.
An unassisted goal from co-captain attack Dean Gibbons minutes later ensured that the Crimson (1-0) would hang on to win its season opener against Canisius (0-2), 9-7, Saturday afternoon at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium.
“We were our best at points today,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “But we were inconsistent in a number of areas, and we have to clean that up in order for us to reach our potential and be the best that we can be.”
Harvard started off the game with a sense of urgency, scoring three unanswered goals. The run was sparked by Gibbons, who was assisted by sophomore attack Peter Schwartz in a man-up situation.
The veteran Gibbons led all scorers with three goals and grabbed a team-high five ground balls. Senior attack Greg Michael scored three goals to lead the Griffs.
Despite leading 3-0 with 13:04 remaining in the second period, the Crimson had any hopes of a blowout dashed when Canisius rattled off three straight scores in the second quarter—the first coming off a fast break and the second coming in a man-up situation.
It would be back and forth for the remainder of the game, with Harvard pulling ahead by two goals, only to see the Griffs respond to even the score.
Canisius was able to stay in contention by controlling the tempo, disrupting the Crimson’s fast-paced offensive system.
“They were slowing it down,” Wojcik said. “We are an up-tempo team, and unfortunately, we came down a couple times, and the goalie made a save—and then we’re back on defense again tiring our defense out.”
“I think we dominated possession, especially in the first quarter,” co-captain Kevin Vaughan said. “We had the ball pretty much the entire time, and I think our shots weren’t really falling—their goalie had a great day. We outshot them almost 2-1, but we really didn’t get our shots on cage.”
In a day when the Crimson’s offense struggled to find the back of the net at times, it turned to its defense for consistency. Sophomore goalkeeper Harry Krieger had an especially noteworthy game, collecting nine saves.
“Harry Krieger played a great game,” Gibbons said. “He’s played great in all our preseason scrimmages—we expected him to have a big day. He helped us out when our offense was struggling. Every defensive person on our team played well.”
Heading into the fourth quarter with the scored knotted at 5-5, the Crimson used its mental toughness to stay calm and collected.
“I just told them, we have 15 minutes right now—how had do we want this game?” Wojcik said. “And I think the team really responded and got fired up. They really responded well down the stretch to the intensity [of the game] and gave a lot of effort.
“In those kinds of situations, you try to remain calm and confident,” Vaughan added. “There was no point in the game where I thought we were in jeopardy of losing; I was confident in our guys and the leaders of our team.”
Junior midfielder Terry White was one such leader, scoring two unassisted goals in a two-minute span that gave Harvard the emotional lift it needed.
“He’s a leader—one of our best players—and he really stepped it up,” Vaughan said.
“Terry White did a great job,” Gibbons said. “Going into the fourth quarter and shooting back-to-back goals, that really helped us get the momentum back, and we were able to take the win from there.”
Though the Griffs would respond with two goals of their own, Harvard used another goal from Doyle to retake the lead, and another unassisted goal from Gibbons all but sealed the win.
“We’re pretty psyched to come out of that close game with a win,” Vaughan said. “Especially that Coach Wojcik’s first game as the head coach of Harvard went down as a ‘W.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—It felt like Groundhog Day at the Pizzitola Sports complex on Friday.
The Crimson, which had trailed by as much as 15 in the opening frame, went into the locker room down, 41-30.
The double-digit deficit hearkened back to the 22-point halftime margin that Harvard eventually overcame in its first matchup against the Bears.
But the Crimson did not have the same feeling at the break as it did on Feb. 12.
“It wasn’t the same for me,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Unlike the first meeting, when Brown’s hot first-half shooting came against tough pressure, the Crimson’s defense was soft for much of the opening period.
“We were pretty disappointed in ourselves,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “Brown shot the ball so well, but part of that was due to our inability to stay in front of the basketball.”
Against Harvard’s sagging defense, the Bears shot 16-of-28 from the field and 7-of-14 from deep.
The Crimson, by comparison, was just 12-of-31 from the floor and 4-of-13 from three.
“It’s scary when we’re not playing as well as we feel like we should...to have a team get out on us like that, especially on the road,” Amaker said.
Still, the situation was not as dire for Harvard as when the two teams first met.
The Crimson recovered from its poor start and erased the deficit in the first eight minutes of the second half.
“Eleven is a lot better than 24 [sic] or whatever it was [last time],” McNally said.
TUCK EVERLASTING
Harvard outclassed Brown in the second half, outscoring the Bears 44-27 in the period, but the hosts remained competitive throughout the contest thanks in large part to the play of forward Tucker Halpern.
The big man shot lights out in the first half en route to scoring 15 points. Halpern did his damage on a couple of drives, including a baseline floater and a banked-in and-one, as well as from distance, as the forward hit three triples in the first half.
“He’s an inside-out threat,” Amaker said. “He’s got great size, he gets his shot off very quickly, and he got going.”
In the second half, Halpern was able to pick up where he left off.
After the Crimson pushed its lead to eight, the Brown forward responded with a three from the left corner.
A minute later, Halpern swished a deep trey from up top to cut the lead to three.
At the four-minute mark, Bears guard Sean McGonagill shoveled a pass back to Halpern on the right wing, where he knocked down his third three of the half to make the score 67-65.
Brown never got any closer to taking the lead.
Halpern finished the night as the high-scorer with 29 points on 10-of-15 shooting and 6-of-9 shooting from three.
“He was their go-to guy, and he led them all the way,” Amaker said.
ON THE REBOUND
With Harvard struggling to find some offense early in the second half, a few timely offensive boards helped jump-start the Crimson’s scoring effort.
On the first possession of the period, sophomore forward Kyle Casey missed a jumper, but junior co-captain Keith Wright corralled the rebound and converted an easy put-back.
The next time down the court sophomore forward Christian Webster chased down a long rebound off a missed three.
After resetting the offense, sophomore guard Brandyn Curry drove and got to the free throw line where he hit both shots.
“[Offensive rebounds] take the life and momentum out of another team, and we were able to get those few there,” Amaker said.
Harvard out-rebounded Brown in the second half, 21-12, and grabbed a total of 10 offensive boards on the night.
Two timely rebounds in the final minutes from Casey and Wright that helped to seal the win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If effort were all that mattered, then the Harvard men’s volleyball team would be undefeated this season.
But despite the best attempts of the Crimson (6-4, 0-2 EIVA Hay), Sacred Heart (6-3, 2-1) took a quick 3-0 victory Saturday afternoon at the Malkin Athletic Center. The loss was the third in a row for Harvard, which started its season 6-1.
“They beat us in every category,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “We played a little bit better in the third game, but we were beaten soundly. I didn’t feel it was ever a particularly close match.”
Harvard started the first set trading points against the Pioneers. With the score tied at five-all, the Crimson rallied behind several blocks from the front row to a 7-5 lead.
Although Harvard missed several serves early, it was able to compensate for the errors with a series of kills.
But the lengthy front row of Sacred Heart made life difficult for the Crimson hitters, and Sacred Heart rallied to tie the score.
Junior Matt Jones then floated one to slow the Pioneers’ momentum, and freshman Kyle Rehkemper aced the next serve to maintain the Harvard lead at 15-12.
But even that was not enough to stop Sacred Heart, as the visitors used a strong service game in combination with great blocking to take the set, 25-18.
Sacred Heart began the second set with three straight points, but Harvard took a lengthy rally followed by a quick kill to keep it close at 3-2.
Just as in the game before, the Crimson found no answer to the Pioneers’ offensive rhythm, and quickly found itself in a 9-6 hole.
Despite tying the score in the middle of the set, Harvard could not find its groove late, as Sacred Heart dominated at the net to take the set, 25-18.
“They didn’t make many errors,” Baise said, “and our offense continued to struggle. You just can’t win games when you’re hitting below .200. Their blocking was pretty good, but it was predictable where we were setting because we didn’t have many choices on offense.”
The two teams traded points to start the third set, and Matt Jones crushed one to tie the game, 3-3. The Crimson hustled after every point, but could not find an answer to Sacred Heart’s offense.
A block by freshman Nick Madden tied the game at six-apiece, and sophomore Rob Lothman tallied a deep ace. With the momentum firmly in its possession, Harvard used a great block by Jones to rally to an 8-6 lead, forcing a Pioneers time-out.
A solid defensive series for the Crimson gave it a 10-7 lead early in the third. Just when it appeared Harvard had hustled its way into another point, a controversial lane violation kept Sacred Heart close at 10-8.
Senior middle Shaun Mansour and Jones led the Crimson defense, both running far out of bounds every series to get loose balls.
“We always play hard,” Baise said. “These guys, they want it so badly. [The effort] is never an issue.”
The Pioneers stepped up their offense in response to Harvard’s hustle, scoring three straight points to tie the game at 12-all.
The Crimson hitters could not adjust to the Sacred Heart blocking, and the Pioneers once again used a combination of strong serves and front-row defense to regain a 16-13 lead, forcing a Harvard timeout.
Coming out of the timeout, the Crimson regained the momentum off a tremendous rally and rallied within one, but a late service error gave Sacred Heart a 22-20 lead.
A kill by the Crimson made it 22-21, but the Pioneers responded with a kill of their own to keep the two-point lead. A controversial line call gave Sacred Heart game point, and the Pioneers took the game—and the match—on a kill.
“We just got to get in practice and serve and pass a lot,” Jones said. “I thought we worked on it a lot during the weekend, but we just need to work on it some more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team struggled early in the season, winning just four of its first 22 games.
But something has clicked for the Crimson as of late.
In a hard-fought game Friday night at the Bright Hockey Center, Harvard (8-19-1, 6-14-1 ECAC) capitalized on two power-play goals to defeat Clarkson (15-17-2, 8-12-1 ECAC), 3-1. In the process, the Crimson won for the fourth time in its past five contests.
“[The] game was great,” said co-captain and forward Michael Del Mauro. “We showed we could play in a close game and in the end come out with a win. That’s the resiliency we need to see at this point in the season.”
The contest began uneventfully, with neither squad able to find the back of the net in the first period. While the Harvard front line struggled initially, managing only three shots on goal in the first nine minutes, the home team began to come alive later in the period, tallying seven shots in the ensuing 11 minutes.
But it wasn’t until the next period that Crimson found the back of the net.
Thanks to an elbowing call on a Knight forward, Harvard earned a power play 13 minutes into the frame. With the Crimson supplying pressure in Clarkson’s defensive zone, junior defenseman Ryan Grimshaw took a shot from the point, which sophomore forward Marshall Everson tried to tip in. The Knights goaltender blocked Everson’s shot, but the puck landed right in front of sophomore forward Alex Fallstrom, who hit it past the Clarkson netminder for the score.
The 1-0 lead proved short-lived. Just 34 seconds later, Clarkson responded with the equalizer.
“The puck moved back, and we really just miscommunicated and misplayed the entire play,” Del Mauro said. “It ended up costing us.”
But that one lapse proved to be the Knights’ only goal of the night.
“[Clarkson’s goal is] something that we were able to recover from which earlier in the year maybe would’ve sent us into a little bit of a spiral,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91.
The score remained tied well into the third period until the Crimson earned its third power play of the night.
And once again, Harvard made Clarkson pay.
With just over six minutes left, freshman defenseman Dan Ford and Grimshaw traded passes at the Knights blue line before Grimshaw fired a shot on goal. Like in the earlier power play, Everson tried to tip it past the Clarkson goaltender. But this time, Everson’s play worked, with the puck finding its way into the net to give the Crimson the 2-1 edge.
With the goal, Harvard had converted 11 of its past 23 power play opportunities in ECAC play.
“Our power play in general looks a lot more dangerous,” Donato said. “[It] has really come on lately.”
“The key to a good power play is puck movement, and I really think we’re moving the puck well and really finding our spots,” Fallstrom added.
But the Crimson’s goal scoring wasn’t finished quite yet. After the visitors pulled their goalie, junior forward Alex Killorn took advantage of the opportunity. After grabbing a loose puck, Killorn skated unchallenged into the Knights zone before easily pushing the puck into the open net.
The goal put the game out of reach for the visitors. With just 40 seconds remaining, getting one goal by the Crimson back line would have been tough, let alone two.
“Our D played great,” Del Mauro said. “We were getting the puck out of our zone and playing in theirs more…which is really ideal.”
Senior goaltender Ryan Carroll led Harvard’s back line, saving 23 of the 24 shots that came his way.
“Carroll was very solid in the net and was very calming for us,” Donato said. “He was very sound and positionally right on.”
Of course, the offense played pretty well too. With its three goals tonight, Harvard has found the back of the net 19 times in its last six games.
“Now the puck’s going into the net a little bit for us,” Donato said. “The next challenge, the next level, is to do it consistently.”
As ECAC playoffs loom near, the Crimson is hitting its stride at exactly the right time.
“You want to be playing your best hockey going into playoffs, and at this point I’m pretty confident saying we’re playing our best hockey,” Del Mauro said. “And we still have more to give.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Senior Night for the Harvard men’s hockey team, it was the seniors, fittingly, who led the way.
Propelled by goals from all three senior forwards—Pier-Olivier Michaud, Michael Biega, and co-captain Michael Del Mauro—the Crimson (9-19-1, 7-14-1 ECAC) pulled out a 4-3 win against St. Lawrence (10-19-15, 6-15-1) Saturday evening at the Bright Hockey Center.
“I think it may have been the first time in their careers that they all scored in the same game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “It was very nice to see them all score on the same night before their family and friends.”
The Crimson started the game off slowly. After Saints forward Pete Child scored from the point less than four minutes into the contest, Harvard trailed by one for most of the first and second periods.
Then, with 4:20 left in the second frame, Michaud triggered a scoring frenzy that would put Harvard ahead within 30 seconds.
Sophomore forward Connor Morrison set up Michael Biega at the top of the right point. Biega threaded the puck through the defense. But the shot bounced wide, and Michaud took advantage.  Sneaking from behind the net, the senior followed it up from the opposite side with a backhand rebound past the goaltender.
The crowd came to its feet as St. Lawrence and Crimson faced off for the next round of play, now tied 1-1. They were satisfied quickly as Harvard found the back of the net again 21 seconds later.
Co-captain and defenseman Chris Huxley found sophomore forward David Valek low on the ice. He brought the puck around the net, looking to try another backhand from the sweet spot Michaud had found moments earlier. But the Saints goalie had learned his lesson and shifted himself left to block the Crimson attack.
Harvard’s offense adapted quickly and Valek fed the puck to the middle, allowing Del Mauro to swoop in after the puck and slam it home, giving the Crimson the lead 2-1 and forcing a St. Lawrence timeout.
“Valek got into their zone and he got the puck first,” Del Mauro said. “I really just went to the front of the net…[and] it’s very easy when guys put the puck on your stick and you’re in front of the goal.”
Harvard’s offensive rhythm was on for the rest of the game and created offensive opportunities all night, outshooting the Saints, 37-35.
“We were a lot better on our forechecks tonight,” Biega said. “We got pucks down low and [their] defense wasn’t able to take it.”
The Crimson’s defensive squad maintained momentum for the rest of the second period, led by senior goalie Ryan Carroll. St. Lawrence offense desperately mounted multiple attacks on goal but found no success. The period expired on several strong defensive plays, keeping the score, 2-1.
“I have to give some credit to St. Lawrence,” Donato said. “But when we needed it, Ryan Carroll came up with some big saves.”
Harvard found the net quickly in the third frame, scoring within 12 seconds of the puck drop. The Saints goaltender mishandled the puck and dropped it right in front of the net. His attempt to clear it failed when sophomore forward Marshall Everson beat him to it and sent it flying past him.
Another Crimson score followed within four minutes when Morrison, in a scramble at mid-ice, found Michaud, who took it down the ice. Michael Biega trailed, setting up a two-on-one play. After drawing the defense, Michaud passed it across to Biega, who neatly fired away what would eventually be the game-winning goal.
“Connor Morrison made a great play in our zone, which led to a two-on-one with me and Pier, ” Biega said. “Pier had a great pass, and I just shot the puck.”
But St. Lawrence wasn’t finished yet, and 11 minutes into the third, the visitors found their first goal since the first period. Mark Armstrong set up a puck reversal with a backhand pass across the middle to Max Mobley, who fed it to Aaron Bogosian for the goal.
The Saints’ final goal came with 2:55 left to play when Greg Carey managed to slip it past Carroll from the left point.
St. Lawrence could come no closer, however, and play expired with tough defensive saves from Harvard.
With the victory, the Crimson has won five of their last six matches, putting the team in a good mindset moving forward into the playoffs.
“Everyone in that room is feeling really good,” Del Mauro said. “[But] if this season has taught us one thing, [it is that] we don’t rest on our laurels…We’re definitely gearing up for playoffs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some teams prefer to ease into their seasons by playing easier games towards the beginning of their schedules and gradually increasing the level of difficulty.
Such a philosophy is certainly not the case for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team, which travelled to Palo Alto, Calif., to take on No. 13 Stanford at Cagan Stadium yesterday.
With 9:53 to go in the game, an early-season upset looked very realistic for the unranked road team, as junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind scored to put the Crimson (0-1) up, 17-16, in a high-scoring affair.
But goals by the Cardinal’s Karen Nesbitt and Jackie Candelaria propelled Stanford on a 2-0 run to end the game, helping the hosts (4-0) squeak out an 18-17 victory.
The Crimson jumped out to an early 2-0 lead off of back-to-back goals from sophomore Danielle Tetreault, 1:26 and 2:18 into the game, respectively.
“We came out hard, and we came out pumped up,” said Tetreault, who led the game with a career-high six goals on the afternoon.
But Tetreault was quick to defer to her teammates.
“I think that we all worked hard,” Tetreault said. “It was just how the game went.”
Late in the first half, Harvard built its largest lead of the contest, thanks to a score from sophomore Micaela Cyr which put the Crimson up, 9-5.
Coming out of a timeout, Candelaria tallied one of her four goals on the afternoon, starting a 4-0 Stanford run to end the half with the score tied at nine.
The Cardinal carried its momentum into the start of the second half, scoring three straight goals. Tetreault finally scored with 25:11 to go to stop the bleeding.
But according to tri-captain Sam McMahon, the quick scores by Stanford were crucial momentum shifts in favor of the Cardinal.
McMahon, who was pleased with her team’s execution in the first half, was quick to applaud Stanford’s ability to use motion or set plays to baffle Harvard.
With the Crimson down by five—its biggest deficit of the game—with less than 20 minutes remaining in the second half, Harvard was still not ready to go away.
The Crimson went on a 6-0 run that involved goals by five different players and eventually retook the lead off of Baskind’s go-ahead goal with under 10 minutes to play.
“I just kind of saw a lane and went for it,” Baskind said.
But Harvard did not hold on to the lead for long, surrendering two consecutive goals to its hosts.
Despite the loss, the Crimson was still pleased with its comeback effort.
“I was really, really proud of our team,” Baskind said. “It was always about just getting the next draw.”
Harvard’s ability to finally start to win draw controls in its comeback attempt was crucial.
“They had been winning them and, you know, coming down and scoring,” McMahon said.
Though the comeback attempt was eventually for naught, it did speak to the potential for this year’s team.
“We’re just more composed this year,” Tetreault said.
The Crimson’s offensive production wasn’t the sole reason it was able to battle back from a five-goal deficit.
“We had a few defensive stands, and that helped with the momentum too,” McMahon said.
She added that she thought Harvard’s defense was successful at being able to identify the plays the Cardinal ran.
Goalie Kerry Clark had a game-high nine saves for the Crimson, six of which came in the second half.
Coming into the game, Stanford had been riding a three-game win streak to open up the season, including wins against powerhouses Notre Dame and Syracuse.
Harvard opens up Ivy League play next Saturday at Cornell.
“It’s good to get that under our belt before moving on to the Ivy League next weekend,” Tetreault said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The postseason has returned to Bright Hockey Center, and on Friday, the Harvard women’s hockey team came out to make a statement.
The second-seeded Crimson (17-10-4) jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first period, cruising to a 6-1 win over seventh-seeded St. Lawrence (16-18-2) in the first game of their best-of-three quarterfinal series.
“I thought that’s exactly what we needed to do—come out flying, put up four goals in the first period,” sophomore Jillian Dempsey said. “You’ve got to come out fast, and you’ve got to come out hungry, and that’s exactly what we did.”
It took just 1:28 for Harvard to get on the scoreboard, putting the first shot of the game in the back of the net.
Freshman Lyndsey Fry took a pass from classmate Marissa Gedman and put a shot on net from the left circle. Saints netminder Maxie Weisz deflected the puck with her left pad, and Dempsey charged in to pound the rebound into the open right side of the net.
After killing off an early-period power play, the Crimson stayed in the driver’s seat, doubling its lead less than seven minutes into the period.
Catching St. Lawrence in transition, tri-captain Kate Buesser pushed the puck ahead to sophomore Josephine Pucci, who beat her defender to skate in alone on Weisz. Pucci stayed composed, going five-hole for the 2-0 lead.
“I think we were really excited to start playing,” Dempsey said. “It’s playoff hockey, so we were just raring to go right at the beginning. And once one pops, the others kind of fall into place. We just kept putting pucks on net and pressuring them.”
Harvard got solid production from all four of its lines, with the fourth line getting in on the fun at the 8:38 mark of the first.
Tri-captain Leanna Coskren created space in the right corner, feeding the puck to junior Alisa Baumgartner at the point. Baumgartner’s hard shot was tipped in by freshman Elizabeth Parker, making it a three-goal lead.
Just over a minute later, a set of perfect tic-tac-toe passing from the third line pushed the score to 4-0. Gedman crossed the puck to freshman Kalley Armstrong, who one-timed a pass onto sophomore Whitney Kennedy’s stick. At the right post, Kennedy put the puck just inside the pipe.
With just over 12 minutes gone in the game, the Crimson had amassed a lead that seemed insurmountable.
“Anytime you can get ahead, it’s good,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It’s also sort of a blessing and a curse. You’ve got to hang onto that 4-0 lead, and sometimes that gets people a little apprehensive.”
A string of penalties marked the last minutes of the first, and on the final penalty—on Fry for high sticking with 1:35 to play in the frame—the Saints broke through.
Brooke Fernandez put a shot on goal from the point, creating a scrum in front of the net. After a few missed attempts, Vanessa Emond poked it past sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy to put St. Lawrence on the scoreboard before the break.
The Saints rode that momentum into the second period, a frame that was dominated by penalties and strong defense from the Crimson blueliners.
“We can never count out a team like St. Lawrence,” Dempsey said. “They just kept playing, and it didn’t really help us that we kept getting penalties, because we kept giving them chances to get back. But I think that was good momentum for us to shut them down on those power plays.”
The Crimson had to kill off four penalties in the second, including a stretch of 49 seconds of 5-on-3 play. But led by Bellamy’s 14 second-period stops, including several athletic body saves, Harvard was able to preserve its three-goal lead—and almost add to it.
Sophomore Kaitlin Spurling put the puck in the net on a shorthanded opportunity, but the goal was called back due to high sticking.
“I think the second period was feeling each other out a little bit more,” Stone said. “[Bellamy] made some big saves...She did her job. I want her to stay aggressive, I want her to stay sharp, no matter what’s going on.”
The Crimson was in better offensive control in the third period, getting good chances in an early 5-on-3 situation. But it took almost 13 minutes for Harvard to light the lamp again.
Tri-captain Liza Ryabkina skated around the perimeter and found linemate Dempsey down low. Dempsey executed a nice deke and swung the puck into the back of the net for her second goal of the afternoon.
“I was just ecstatic that she saw me there, because I kind of just snuck in,” Dempsey said. “I was just there to put it away—she did all the work and made a beautiful pass. It’s awesome playing with her.”
After St. Lawrence pulled Weisz with just over five minutes to play, senior Katharine Chute iced the game with an empty-netter to push the final score to 6-1. Nicolien Bongaerts replaced Weisz in net for the last 4:09 of the game, making one save.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A flurry of three-pointers in the first half provided the Harvard women’s basketball team (16-8, 8-2 Ivy) a lead that it would not relinquish, resulting in a 72-59 victory over Brown.
The squad’s relentless play and rebounding avenged an earlier 57-56 road loss to the Bears (7-18, 3-8) on Feb. 12.
“There was added motivation because we were pretty disappointed with the loss at [Brown],” co-captain Christine Matera said. “I wouldn’t say [there was added] pressure—just motivation. But I mean, every game is important at this stage.”
Sophomore Victoria Lippert led the Harvard offense with 22 points on 7-of-13 shooting, including 4-of-6 from the beyond the arc. The Crimson capitalized on the Bears’ 23 turnovers, which turned into 34 points for Harvard.
“She can do it inside; she can do it outside,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “She can do it at the line and she was hitting her threes. I think Vic did a nice job tonight.”
Both teams started slow with a layup from Bears sophomore Lauren Clarke being the only points either team scored in the first two and a half minutes of the game.
The teams then traded baskets resulting in seven lead changes in the first nine and a half minutes. A Lippert three-pointer with 11:31 left in the first half gave Harvard a 13-12 lead and started a 19-2 run for the Crimson. The rally, which lasted about four minutes, set the score at 29-14.
Harvard’s streak was led by the hot shooting of Lippert and Matera. The two teammates highlighted the Crimson’s three-point shooting in the first half with both going perfect from downtown.
During the run, Lippert scored 10 points while Matera scored six.  With 9:49 remaining in the first half, the co-captain made a three that gave the Crimson a 20-14 lead and started a run of four consecutive treys by Matera and Lippert.
“[Junior guard] Brogan [Berry] did a fine job of setting me [up for] the threes,” Lippert said. “[Matera] was hitting shots. Those shots don’t always go in, but it’s sure nice when they do. Great momentum-builder to be able to do that.”
Harvard never trailed after the run, but Brown, after regrouping during a timeout, came out and responded with 12-2 run of its own, making the score, 31-26, with 4:03 remaining in the first half.
The Bears had five different players hit shots in the run, highlighted by back-to-back threes by sophomore guards Sheila Dixon and Lindsay Nickel.
Nickel led the Bears with 15 points on 5-of-7 shooting and 4-of-5 from downtown. Brown held the Crimson to only one basket in a span of three minutes and 49 seconds during the Bears’ run.
A strong drive by freshman guard Christine Clark got her to the free-throw line and two points to stop the run.
Brown further closed the gap with an 8-2 run capped off by a Nickel three-pointer that cut Harvard’s lead to one with a halftime score of 35-34.
“One of the things was to stop their threes and buckle down on defense and get one stop at a time,” Lippert said. “Just come out with momentum and keep it for the rest of the half. Have no letdowns and just take it on our home court and defend our house.”
The Crimson came out of halftime and responded with a 5-0 run while playing strong defense, holding the Bears scoreless for the first three minutes and 40 seconds of the half.
After Brown’s first bucket by Hannah Passafuime’s three-pointer, Harvard went on a 10-3 run, which pushed the lead to 50-40 with 13:34 remaining in the game.
But once again, the Bears responded to the Crimson’ streak with an Aileeen Daniels three-point play and a Nickel trey, cutting the score, 50-46.
“I think it was a game of runs,” Matera said. “We had opportunities where we brought the lead to double digits, and then they would bring the score back down to four to six point. So we were looking to extend the lead at those times where we got it to like 10 or 13 points, and it just didn’t happen. They played a really hard game, and we weathered their runs.”
Another Harvard run pushed the score to 57-47 with 9:45 left in the period. Brown never got within six points the rest of the night, keyed by strong free-throw shooting from Berry, who made 5-of-6 down the stretch to ensure the victory.
“I’m proud; I thought we played like champions,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought that we handled the pressure and felt that we came together. I loved the fact that we took care of the ball and did not have a lot turnovers; we took good shots for the most part, and our defense was tough.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having avenged its loss to Brown a night earlier, the Harvard women’s basketball team (16-9, 8-3 Ivy) took the floor Saturday night against Yale (13-3, 9-3) hoping to take back another early-season defeat. Despite the high expectations, Harvard was unable to complete the weekend sweep and fell to the Bulldogs, 78-64. It was Yale’s first win at Lavietes Pavilion since 2001.
On Senior Night, with four members of the Crimson playing their last game at home, poor three-point shooting hurt the squad, who only managed to hold the lead in the first three minutes of the game. But after the three-minute mark, Yale’s Michelle Cashen converted on a pair of free throws to tie the game, 6-6, and the Bulldogs never looked back, grabbing its first sweep over Harvard since the 1993-1994 season.
Yale surged to a 17-point lead with 8:47 to go in the first half, as the Crimson’s Emma Markley, who was tagged with two early fouls, watched from the sidelines. Despite limited playing time, the senior forward scored 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting for Harvard.
The Bulldogs shut down the Crimson’s other main contributor, guard Brogan Berry, who scored her 1000th point earlier in the week against Columbia (6-10, 5-7 Ivy). The junior finished with 13 points after a sub-par 5-for-17 night from the field.
Harvard was able to cut into the Bulldogs’ lead numerous times, but three-point shooting by Yale guard Megan Vasquez put an end to the Crimson’s streaks. Vasquez, who sank four buckets from behind the arc, made more three-pointers than the entire Harvard team combined. The Crimson’s first three-point conversion came from co-captain Jackie Alemany, with 3:30 left to play in the game.
“Yale did a good job of taking our threes away,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They hit threes and we didn’t. If you look at the stats, that’s the bottom line.”
The Bulldogs also did well shooting from the free-throw line during Saturday’s game. Yale converted on 26 of its 28 attempts from the charity stripe, whereas the Crimson went 17-for-21.
An area in which Harvard did have the advantage was bench play. With 14 points from sophomore guard Victoria Lippert, the Crimson outscored Yale’s bench, 20-10. Freshman center Elise Gordon also made key buckets for Harvard on Saturday, finishing 3-for-3 with six points.
Behind solid defense and transition play, the Crimson was able to reduce Yale’s lead to four points in the second half.
“We were talking well on defense and getting easier buckets on the other end,” co-captain Christine Matera said. “If we would have put that together for 40 minutes, it would have been a different ball game.”
Matera, along with fellow captain Alemany and Markley, played her last home game on Saturday night. Though she had a rough night from the field, finishing 0-for-4 with zero points, Matera was not going to let her last game leave a mark.
“It’s disappointing for the four of us that our last game at Lavietes is going to be a loss,” the senior guard said. “But we’ve had some good memories here, so this game isn’t going to define the past four years.”
The fourth senior featured on Harvard’s roster, Claire Wheeler, was sidelined with an injury as her teammates faced the Bulldogs. Wheeler was included in the Senior Night festivities, however, as she and her parents received a set of balloons and a bouquet of flowers. Though she was not able to play, Wheeler displayed her singing ability Saturday night, as she kicked off the game with a rendition of the national anthem.
Delaney-Smith was proud of her seniors’ play, but unhappy with the outcome of their last home game.
“I’m disappointed for them,” Delaney-Smith said. “I’m proud of how hard they worked; I’m proud that they left their hearts out on the floor. I’m sure this is one that is not going to go away quickly.”
The Crimson found itself ranked second in the Ivy League behind the Princeton Tigers (21-4, 10-1) going into Saturday’s contest. After the loss, the Crimson can now only advance to the NCAA Tournament with Yale and Princeton losses. But some members of the team remain optimistic for their postseason hopes.
“Our fingers are crossed,” Matera said. “Situations like this have happened before, but I know we’ll bounce back. All that we can do is work hard the rest of the season and win out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suffering an emotional defeat to No. 73 William and Mary on Saturday, the No. 68 Harvard women’s tennis team went full-steam ahead to defeat the No. 63 Boilermakers, 5-2, last night at the Murr Center.
“We lost a heartbreaker yesterday, and we knew today was going to be a dog fight,” Crimson coach Terri Green said. “We were ready to fight the whole way through.”
NO. 68 HARVARD 5, NO. 63 PURDUE 2
Fight Harvard did. First-time doubles teammates, junior Sam Gridley and freshman Amanda Black, gave Harvard an 8-6 victory after being down, 6-3. The No. 2 doubles team of freshman Hannah Morrill and junior co-captain Holly Cao also battled to a tough 9-7 win, while Harvard’s No. 1 duo, sophomores Kristen Norton and Hideko Tachibana, dropped their match, 8-6, to Purdue’s Jennifer Rabot and Mara Schmidt.
Taking the doubles match provided a rallying point for the Crimson.
“We just tried to focus on our energy rather than our game, screaming after every point,” Gridley said. “It really worked, and our games elevated to match our energy.”
This energy transferred to Harvard’s singles play as well, with the Crimson taking four of the six matches.
Cao pulled in an easy victory in No. 1 singles, winning 6-0 in the first set and 6-3 in the second, while Tachibana grabbed a win with scores of 6-4, 6-4, in the second slot.
After tying the match at one set each, Norton slammed the ball out of reach of her opponent to produce a 6-3 comeback win in final point of the No. 3 singles match.
“She was hitting it deep a lot, and I was just missing everything,” Norton said, “I decided to change my game plan and come in more, and I started to make more shots.”
Relying on her speed and net play, Gridley dominated the first set, 6-2, fell 6-4 in the second, and stuck out a lengthy third set to win, 10-8.
Morrill dropped her No. 5 match to the Boilermakers’ Imogen Golder, 6-2, 6-3. Sophomore Alex Lehman also suffered a 7-5, 6-4 loss to Purdue’s Gisella Pere.
“I feel like our mental toughness really shined today,” Green said.
NO. 73 WILLIAM AND MARY 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard fell 4-3 to the Tribe, dropping the deciding point in the doubles matches.
In the No. 1 doubles match, Norton and partner Tachibana pulled out the Crimson’s only win with an 8-2 domination.
The Tribe replicated Harvard’s performance in the other doubles matches, defeating the Crimson’s No. 2 team of Blosser and Cao, 8-2, and the No. 3 team of Morrill and co-captain Samantha Rosekrans, 8-3.
“We’ve been working on doubles in practice [because] that was our weak point,” Cao said. “Unfortunately, that didn’t [work] so well for us today.”
With William and Mary striking early, the pressure was on for the singles matches.
Ending her match with an easy lob, Cao was able to produce a strong victory in the No. 1 singles match, defeating the Tribe’s Hope Johnson, 6-4, 6-1.
“We fought much harder in singles, but we couldn’t get our first doubles point,” Cao said. “It’s harder playing with a partner, and sometimes you just have off days.”
The Crimson showed their strength in singles, but William and Mary fought just as hard, leading to a 3-3 score for the matches.
Cao and Norton gave Harvard easy wins in the No. 1 and No. 3 singles matches, while Gridley came back from a loss in the first set to earn a 6-3 and a 1-0 victory in her second and third sets, respectively.
Playing in the No. 2 singles match, Tachibana notched the win in the first set, 6-4.
The second set did not have the same result, as the large amount of on-the-net play found Tachibana dropping the set, 7-5. The Tribe’s freshman Jeltje Loomans sealed the victory with 6-4 score in the third set.
Harvard will take a two-week break before heading to California for its next match.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to make it big in the Big Apple, the Crimson track and field teams chased after the Ivy League title this weekend at the Heptagonal Championships at the New York City Armory. Harvard, who recorded a fourth-place finish at last year’s tournament, came into this contest with high hopes, looking to capitalize on a strong start to the season.
Unfortunately, the momentum did not seem to swing in the team’s favor, as the men finished fourth and the women fifth in a strong showing at the Armory.
“We’ve moved up the ranks in the last couple of years,” said Crimson coach Jason Saretsky on both teams’ performances. “We’re a young team who pulled out some big points this weekend, and we look very promising for the future.”
Coming into the tournament, Harvard boasted a dozen of top-10 Ivy League performances in a variety of events this season. But, once in the Armory, history went entirely out the window. At the end of the day, only results talked on the track.
The men got off to a scoring start Saturday as senior Dan Chenoweth grabbed third in the 3,000 meter (8:08.07). Junior pole-vaulter Nico Weiler was next to strike for the Crimson, pulling out a fourth-place finish following his 4.9-meter clearance in the pole vault. Not to be outperformed, Harvard’s weight throwers grabbed additional points for the team. Leading the weight-thrower squad were co-captain Ablorde Ashigbi (17.72), rookie Dustin Brode (17.14), and senior Eric Clayman (17.10), who all managed to place in the top 10, finishing fourth, fifth, and sixth, respectively.
For the women, the field team came to town to win some points. Freshman Adabelle Ekechukwu proved to be the standout competitor, posting a second-place finish in the weight throw for a 17.41-meter performance.
The Crimson also saw success in the long jump, boasting a fourth-place finish (5.81) from sophomore Olivia Weeks, as well as the pole vault, where freshman Adriann LaChance’s fifth-place performance captured three more points for the team.
Closing the first day, the Crimson captured two top-six places in the pentathlon. Junior Nicole Silva ammassed 3,294 points for fifth place, and Reed came in sixth with 3,291—both results adding five more points to Harvard’s tally. This left both the men’s and women’s teams with 17 points each for the day.
Coming into Sunday, the men’s squad stood in third place, needing a strong showing in all of its events to truly make a challenge for the title. In the 500-meter race, junior John Dingus earned fourth place with a time of 1:03.34. Speeding through the 800-meter race, Hill captured sixth place for the team. The distance squad continued to prove the team’s strong suit, ending the 4x800 event sixth overall. The distance medley relay paced its way to third place.
Then, in another strong showing from the field team, Brode and sophomore Edward Brucker finished third and fifth, respectively, in the shotput, while freshman Kobi Rex finished fourth place in the high jump. But Harvard’s total of 41 points kept it shy of an overall first-place finish, ending fourth overall in the competition, and only four points shy of third-placed Ivy foe Dartmouth.
‘‘We finished fourth last year and with a similar margin between us and third place,” said co-captain and middle distance runner Brian Hill. “It was a little disappointing to not get placed into the top three. But we had some encouraging performances, and brought in some big points.’’
For the women, the second day of competition proved just as exciting as the first. Freshman Meisha Brooks finished fourth and qualified for ECACs, with a 400-meter time of 56.01.
Co-captain Thea Lee followed suit in the 800-meter, placing sixth and qualifying with a time of 2:11.82. In the relays, both the 4x400 and 4x800 teams combined for 10 points, finishing third and fourth, respectively.
The women ended the day with 48 points, a fifth-place finish, and two second-team All-Ivy accolades for Ekechukwu and Hirst for their strong performance.
“Overall, I was pleased with both our men’s and women’s squad,” Saretsky said, “No one person could really be singled out. We competed very hard, and had a lot of standout performances, which led to success.”
The Crimson will be back in action during the ECAC and IC4A Championships on March 5-6.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite midseason upheaval, the 2011 Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Carnival season finished exactly as it started: with the University of Vermont at the top and Harvard in ninth.
But for the EISA’s top skiers, the end of the college carnival season did not mark the end of racing, and three Harvard skiers, sophomores Catherine Sheils and Alena Tofte and freshman Rebecca Nadler, will continue their seasons at the NCAA championships.
“It’s exciting to have as many skiers doing a postseason,” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “It’s a nice development to be able to look beyond just the college racing.”
Sheils and Nadler became the first Harvard alpine women ever to qualify for NCAAs, while Tofte became the first Nordic skier to qualify since 2004.
Sheils posted the best results of any Harvard skier this weekend with a 14th-place finish in the slalom and a 22nd-place result in the giant slalom.
“Those were her two best collegiate giant slalom, last week and this week,” alpine coach Tim Mitchell said. It’s a big step for her to be more of a two-event skier.”
For Sheils, the final weekend capped off a season of consistent improvement.
“She switched ski boots: it usually takes a little while to get used to it and settled,” Mitchell said. “She changed like a week and a half before the first race...her speed has always been there; it’s just a question of increasing consistency.”
Classmate Tofte had a strong finish in Sunday’s 15k classic mass start, placing 15th, but did not finish Saturday’s 5k freestyle.
“She wasn’t even that close [to qualifying] last year,” City said. “This is a really impressive jump. She was consistently in the top-15 skiers including today...making NCAAs is a reflection of [her consistency]. There wasn’t a race where she didn’t have a shot at a top-15 finish.”
Nadler’s collegiate season came to a disappointing finish; the rookie placed  49th in the slalom on Saturday and did not finish the giant slalom.
But Nadler’s races at the start of the season were strong enough to propel her into NCAAs.
Mitchell reported that Nadler was still recovering from a crash sustained during the previous weekend’s Middlebury College Winter Classic. The alpine coach added that she skied well while she managed to stay in the course.
“She’s had really horrible luck the last few weeks,” Mitchell said. “She went to Turkey [for the World University Games] and got really sick there on her way back...It looked like things were starting to turn around, and then she had a bad crash. She’s still pretty sore...I’m pretty confident she’ll be back on track [for NCAAs].”
The other skiers headed for the postseason are freshmen Nordic skiers Jen Rolfes and Chris Stock, who will both compete at the junior Olympics. Tofte and freshman Tanner Wiegand also qualified but will not compete. Tofte declined in order to compete at NCAAs, and Wiegand is unable to make the event.
Rolfes posted the Crimson’s strongest finish in the women’s 5k freestyle race with a 21st-place mark.
“It’s great that she had her best race at the end of the season,” City said.
Stock, meanwhile, placed 31st in the men’s 10k freestyle race. The freshman did not compete in Sunday’s 20k classic mass start so that he could rest up for the junior Olympics.
Junior Caroline McHugh joined Sheils, Tofte, and Rolfes as the only Harvard skiers to post top-30 finishes this weekend with a 24th-place result in the giant slalom.
Junior Kevin McNamara, sophomore Esther Kennedy, and Nordic co-captain Cara Sprague all managed to take top-40 finishes over the course of the weekend.
McNamara came in the 36th spot in the giant slalom on Sunday despite dropping a ski pole in one of his runs. The junior took 37th in Saturday’s slalom.
Kennedy placed 34th in the 15k classic mass start race, just ahead of Sprague, who came in 37th, and Rolfes, who took 38th.
“Cara ended her season not quite where she wanted to be,” City said. “She’s one of those seniors who’s doing a thesis and applying to medical school...I was proud of the work she did to pull that [race] off.”
While the team will miss Sprague, who finished sixth in the classic event at last year’s EISA championships, it will return a strong core of talented young skiers next season.
“I think we’ve got a good base,” City said. “It’s an exciting place to build from.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second period of Game 2 of the ECAC quarterfinals ended with questions. Would Harvard squander a four-goal lead? Would St. Lawrence rally to force a third game?
It only took Crimson tri-captain Kate Buesser 15 seconds to answer those questions with a resounding “no.” And in case the Saints didn’t get the message, sophomore Jillian Dempsey scored 45 seconds later to make the point clear and propel Harvard (17-10-4, 14-5-3 ECAC) to an 8-3 victory over St. Lawrence (16-18-2, 11-11) Saturday afternoon at the Bright Hockey Center.
“The kids answered the challenge we gave to them between the second and third period that said ‘Hey…What are we going to be?’” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “They came out bang-bang right away.”
Like the third period, the first period was Harvard’s from the beginning. The Crimson came out with more speed than the Saints and was able to dominate the puck early. Katharine Chute was effective intercepting pucks and creating plays in the middle of the ice. While the senior forward was not able to score on her solo rushes, she put St. Lawrence’s skaters on the defensive early. Five minutes into the game, Chute’s efforts paid off when she was able to find classmate Ashley Wheeler, and Wheeler sent the puck to Buesser, who one-timed the puck past Saints goaltender Maxie Weisz, a grad student.
Two minutes later, sophomore defenseman Josephine Pucci hit Wheeler on the left side of the net, and the senior forward was able to capitalize for the game’s second goal.
“Our first period lately has been very good, and I think that just means we’re ready to play,” Buesser said. “We want to get out from the gates very fast and get them on their heels.”
With a two-goal lead, the Crimson played with poise. Rather than forcing shots, Harvard had time to look for opportune moments.
Freshman Gina McDonald found one 16 minutes into the period. Sophomore Whitney Kennedy fired the puck from the middle of the offensive zone. The puck bounced off a St. Lawrence defenseman and McDonald was able to slam it home to make it, 3-0.
With one minute remaining in the frame, Buesser took advantage of a five-on-three scenario and tipped in her second goal of the game off an assist from Pucci. The tri-captain’s score would be the Crimson’s last for 21 minutes of ice time.
For the first few minutes of the second period, Harvard seemed to maintain its first-frame momentum, but the tides turned quickly. The Saints picked up their tempo and were able to seize control of the puck and put pressure on Crimson sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy.
For the first half of the period, Bellamy had stopped all the shots that came, and Harvard’s defensemen were able to clear the puck. But 12 minutes into the frame, St. Lawrence’s persistence paid off when senior Karell Emard fired the puck across the net to junior Josee Belanger, who one-timed it into the cage.
Two and a half minutes later, first-year Rylee Smith struck on a solo rush down the ice. Only Chute was able to keep up with Smith, but the Saints’ forward was able to outmaneuver her Crimson counterpart and earn a one-on-one with Bellamy for an easy goal.
St. Lawrence’s third goal, scored by junior Vanessa Emond, came off a Bellamy save. The sophomore netminder had stopped the initial shot by Saints’ junior Alley Bero, but the puck bounced right to Emond, who fired into the open net.
“We kind of sold our goaltender out a few times,” Stone said. “She’s kept us in a lot of ball games, so we need to do a better job taking care of the puck and taking care of her.”
After starting the period ahead by four, Harvard finished the second frame ahead by one.
“We made things a little closer than they needed to be with turnovers and not the smartest plays,” Stone said. “They’re a highly skilled team. They played well. They weren’t going to go away—we had to beat them.”
But it didn’t take the Crimson long to right the ship. In the opening seconds of the third period, Buesser received the puck in the middle of the ice right next to her own bench. The tri-captain skated past all of St. Lawrence’s skaters and fired the puck past Weisz.
Following Buesser’s, sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey scored at the one-minute mark on a nearly identical rush. Like Buesser, Dempsey received the puck next to Harvard’s bench and skated across the ice, outmaneuvering all the defensemen in her way. Unlike Buesser, though, Dempsey released the puck in the center of the offensive zone.
“It was huge, just to set the tone right off the bat,” Stone said of the two goals. “[We] came out with more energy and all of a sudden it was right back up where it needed to be.”
Nine minutes later, Dempsey struck again off a cross-cage assist from tri-captain Liza Ryabkina.
Down four goals, the Saints pulled Weisz to try to even the scoreboard. But the plan backfired when Harvard freshman Marissa Gedman scored from behind the Crimson’s own blue-line to put Harvard ahead by five.
While a second-period slump seemed to put the game in jeopardy, the Crimson was able to dominate play at the game’s crucial moments.
“We’re a team where if we try to do too much, it doesn’t work,” Stone said. “We keep things simple and use everyone, play a team game, we’re in good shape.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The postseason is well underway in Division I women’s hockey, with the semifinals and finals of each of the five conference tournaments scheduled for this weekend. By Sunday night, the eight berths to the NCAA tournament will be decided. But with a lot of high-level hockey still left to play, The Back Page gives you a preview of what that championship field is looking like.
Locks:
 
1. Wisconsin
2. Cornell
3. Mercyhurst
4. Minnesota
5. Minnesota-Duluth
The three WCHA titans—the only three teams to have ever won an NCAA championship—along with last year’s national runner-up Cornell and Frozen Four host Mercyhurst are absolute locks for the tournament, no matter what happens in conference tournaments this weekend. Barring a major upset in the WCHA tournament, Wisconsin should have the top seed safely in hand. Its 32-2-2 record is the best in the country, with the only blemishes coming at the hands of Minnesota and Minnesota-Duluth. The Badgers have distanced themselves from the Big Red, which has lost a bit of momentum in the last few weeks with a tie at Clarkson, a loss at Dartmouth, and a scare from eighth-seeded Rensselaer in the opening game of the ECAC quarterfinals.
 
Should Be In:
 
1. Boston  University
2. Boston  College
Hockey East’s top two schools should both be safely into the tournament at this point, although BU’s stock has fallen a bit thanks to a pedestrian 4-3-1 record in February, mainly coinciding with the absence of freshman star Marie-Philip Poulin due to injury. The Terriers draw Northeastern in the Hockey East semifinals—the two teams skated to a tie in the Beanpot consolation final—and though a loss may hurt BU’s seeding, its impressive regular-season resume should be enough to carry it into the tournament. Meanwhile, BC has had a slightly better month, including a win over the Terriers in the Beanpot. If the Eagles slip up against Providence in the semifinals, things could get interesting, but a pair of wins over BU, plus wins over bubble teams Providence, Dartmouth, and Harvard, should be enough to push BC in regardless.
 
On the Bubble:
 
1. North Dakota
2. Dartmouth
The Fighting Sioux and the Big Green, ranked No. 8 and No. 9 in the latest USCHO.com poll, are in essentially the same situation—both teams were seriously tested in their quarterfinal series, ultimately prevailing over Bemidji State and Clarkson, respectively, in overtime of the deciding third game. That doesn’t necessarily inspire confidence in either program, but both also carry some signature wins—Dartmouth upended Cornell in the last weekend of the regular season, while North Dakota has two wins over Minnesota-Duluth, three over Minnesota, and one over BU. Both teams will be underdogs heading into the conference semifinals—the Big Green visits a playoff-tested Harvard squad, and the Fighting Sioux must get by top-ranked Wisconsin—but one of the two is likely to grab the last at-large spot.
3. Harvard
Harvard looked the sharpest out of any of the four remaining teams in the ECAC tournament last weekend, outscoring St. Lawrence, 14-4, in a two-game sweep. The Crimson has played good hockey of late, keeping games with Cornell and BC close, and it swept Dartmouth in the teams’ regular-season match-ups. Harvard likely needs the auto-bid given to the ECAC tournament champion to break into the NCAA field, but with some upsets in the other conference tournaments, it has a small chance at the last at-large bid.
4. Providence
With neither BU nor BC looking unbeatable at this point, Providence has a good chance to shake things up in the Hockey East tournament this weekend. The squad will likely need to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA field, but in one of the more evenly-balanced conferences in the country, that’s a definite possibility.
 
Still Alive:
 
1. Quinnipiac (ECAC)
2. Northeastern (Hockey East)
3. Niagara, Syracuse, Robert Morris, Wayne State (CHA)
Any of these six teams need to win their conference tournaments to get into the tournament, and none of the six have a particularly good shot at it. Quinnipiac would have to take down both Cornell and the winner of the Harvard/Dartmouth game on the road to get the ECAC crown; Northeastern’s 6-10-5 Hockey East record doesn’t bode well for its chances against the league’s top three squads; and Mercyhurst was a perfect 16-0-0 in CHA play this season.

A newly released single by Stephen L. Kent '14 is gripping campus, or at least the Statistics Department.
The song, a parody of Jason Derulo's iconic party tune "Ridin' Solo," glorifies Statistics 110: "Introduction to Probability," taught by Assistant Professor Joseph K. Blitzstein.
Kent, who plans on concentrating in statistics, said that he made the song on a whim after Blitzstein made a joke in class about Stat 110's need for a theme song.
"The professor made a passing remark that he wished there was a Stat 110 theme song for the class. It was obvious that he knew no one would take him up on it, but there I was, sitting among 200 or so other students in the class," Kent said. "I thought, you know what, I have a pretty free weekend, so I'm going to write that song."
Kent's fame within the Statistics Department has even spread off-campus. Department Chair Xiao-Li Meng, Whipple V. N. Jones Professor of Statistics, who is currently on sabbatical, wrote in an e-mail to Blitzstein that the spoof "has got to be the best statistics song ever!"

Bromance Languages, a new rap band shaking up Harvard's campus, just released their self-produced album "Brutes of Our Labour."
A collaboration among Daniel I. Brandt '12, Jack A. Holkeboer '12, an inactive Crimson editoral editor, William D. Kehler '11-'12, and Josh A. Grossman '11, the group recorded the album using only a microphone from the game Rock Band. They group also used a room in Mather that they had converted into a private studio.
Check out this video interview with the band, where they perform some of their rhymes and show "how much swag [they] have."
