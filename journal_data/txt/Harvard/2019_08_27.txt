After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

While most Harvard freshmen settle into their dorms Tuesday, one new student, Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, faces ongoing negotiations with immigration officers to allow him to enter the United States and study at the College.
U.S. officials deported Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, Friday night shortly after he arrived at Boston Logan International Airport. Before canceling Ajjawi’s visa, immigration officers subjected him to hours of questioning — at one point leaving to search his phone and computer — according to a written statement by Ajjawi.
University officials are currently working to resolve the matter before classes begin on Sept. 3, Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email.
“The University is working closely with the student’s family and appropriate authorities to resolve this matter so that he can join his classmates in the coming days,” he wrote.
Harvard both employs immigration lawyers at the Office of the General Counsel and staffs the Harvard International Office. Both groups work to resolve visa-related problems like Ajjawi’s. Ajjawi wrote that he has been in contact with HIO Director of Immigration Services Maureen Martin.
Ajjawi wrote that he has also contacted AMIDEAST, the non-profit organization that awarded him a scholarship to study in the U.S., which is now providing him legal assistance.
A State Department official declined to comment specifically on Ajjawi's case as visa records are confidential under U.S. law. U. S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Michael S. McCarthy wrote in an emailed statement that CBP found Ajjawi "inadmissible" to the country.
"Applicants must demonstrate they are admissible into the U.S. by overcoming ALL grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds," McCarthy wrote. "This individual was deemed inadmissible to the United States based on information discovered during the CBP inspection.”
Ajjawi wrote that he spent eight hours in Boston before he was required to leave. Upon arrival, Ajjawi faced questioning from immigration officials along with several other international students. While the other students were allowed to leave, Ajjawi alleges an immigration officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon.
The same officer then asked him to unlock his phone and laptop, and left to search them for roughly five hours, Ajjawi alleges. After the search, the officer questioned him about his friends’ social media activity.
“When I asked every time to have my phone back so I could tell them about the situation, the officer refused and told me to sit back in [my] position and not move at all,” he wrote. “After the 5 hours ended, she called me into a room , and she started screaming at me. She said that she found people posting political points of view that oppose the US on my friend[s] list.”
Ajjawi wrote that he told the officer he had not made any political posts and that he should not be held responsible for others’ posts.
“I responded that I have no business with such posts and that I didn't like, [s]hare or comment on them and told her that I shouldn't be held responsible for what others post,” he wrote. “I have no single post on my timeline discussing politics.”
The officer then canceled Ajjawi’s visa, informed him he would be deported, and allowed him a phone call to his parents.
Though Ajjawi’s situation is rare among Harvard undergraduates, in 2017 four graduate students faced similar challenges due to a then-effective travel ban instituted by the Trump Administration. Those students eventually entered the U.S. after weeks and months in limbo, and the University warned international students not to leave the country.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow also waded into the national debate over immigration policy earlier this year. In July, he penned a letter to United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan to share his “deep concern” about the federal government’s approach to immigration policy.
Bacow’s letter specifically cited visa challenges Harvard affiliates like Ajjawi face, in the form of both delays and denials.
Ajjawi, who has since returned home to Lebanon, wrote that he is in touch with a lawyer and hopes to resolve his visa issues so he can arrive this week before classes start next Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate School of Education professor Julie A. Reuben will serve as the faculty director of Phillips Brooks House and Center for Public Interest Careers director Travis A. Lovett as the assistant dean for civic engagement and service beginning this fall, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in an email to students Tuesday.
Reuben and Lovett’s dual appointments mark the end of a more than yearlong vacancy left by former Dean of Public Service Gene A. Corbin’s departure in May 2018. When Corbin stepped down, the College launched a review of service initiatives that resulted in their decision to create the two new positions to succeed Corbin’s.
When the search launched earlier this year, College Dean for Administration Sheila C. Thimba said she hoped the appointments would usher in a “different model” for public service at Harvard by centralizing service opportunities and developing programming focused on social entrepreneurship.
That plan for a new public service model includes the decision to establish a faculty director position similar to that of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and other academic centers at Harvard. Thimba said in a Monday interview that the Center for Ethics’s model for promoting collaboration across Harvard’s schools inspired some of the changes at the Phillips Brooks House.
“[The] Safra Center — I've worked with them very closely in thinking about what it means to elevate civic engagement on campus,” she said. “They've convened a group from across Harvard, including the Medical School, the Public Health School, and so on, to talk about what the initiatives are in each of those areas and how those initiatives can build off each other.”
Thimba co-chaired the search committee for the assistant dean position alongside Institute of Politics Director Mark D. Gearan ’78. After listing the position online, the group selected four candidates out of more than 140 applicants, according to Thimba. They settled on Lovett after soliciting student and faculty feedback.
The College collected nominations from students and faculty for the faculty director position, and administrators chose Reuben from among a pool of more than a dozen nominees. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Monday interview that he was looking for a candidate whose research interests were relevant to the position.
“The key criteria was the skills needed for where we're going, the interest in this area, and research interest, in particular, was important,” he said.
The past several years have seen both an influx of cash to the Phillips Brooks House and increasingly low numbers of Harvard seniors entering careers in public service. Lovett wrote in a statement he hopes to address the latter by broadening the ways Harvard encourages undergraduates to pursue service-related activities.
“There are so many pathways for students to engage our work, whether it’s through volunteering, political activism, engaged scholarship, pre-professional experiences, or intercultural immersion,” he wrote. “We are excited to create a culture where every Harvard College student is civically engaged in a meaningful way.”
When she enters her office in the corner of Harvard Yard, Reuben will put her research into practice — she previously studied the role of morality in American universities.
“My research focuses on the ways in which universities have understood and implemented their social responsibilities for the past two centuries,” Reuben wrote in a statement. “This remains a relevant and vital issue today.”
Reuben has worked closely with undergraduates during her time at Harvard — she has directed the Educational Studies secondary field since its launch in 2018. She has also previously taught undergraduate seminars and will lead a General Education lecture course in the spring.
As assistant dean, Lovett will direct the Center for Public Interest Careers and the Public Service Network. He will report to Reuben, who will directly oversee the Phillips Brooks House Association and the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship. They are scheduled to take their new posts on Sept. 3.
