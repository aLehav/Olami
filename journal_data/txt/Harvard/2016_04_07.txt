After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zayn Malik is cruising. More than a month after the release of his “Pillowtalk” music video (a work that sought to destroy all gender and relationship binaries) and just three days after he dropped his debut solo LP, “Mind of Mine,” Malik continues to add fuel to the art criticism/media fire with his latest music video—this time for “iT’s YoU.” In this black-and-white number, Malik discards the psychedelia of “Pillowtalk” and the low-key, down-to-earth vibe of his second video “BeFoUr” (both an exploration of youth culture and a reflection on his departure from 1D) for a more muted, sultry tone. But what does this direction mean? Has Malik succumbed to the commercial pressures of artistic production, foregoing experimentation or rough honesty for something more polished and traditional, if less interesting? The slow-mo says yes, but the hidden narrative says no.
At its most surface level, both lyrically and visually “iT’s YoU” tells the stereotypical story of a romantic break-up between a young man and woman. But after several viewings, no literary aficionado can deny the deeper truth: Malik’s latest product oozes with references to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.”
Note how often Malik is positioned to stare wistfully. He enters the music video only to walk toward a window. At the start of the second verse, the camera jumps to a shot of him sitting in the middle of the room, eyes turned to an unknown object at the right. He smokes; the fumes obscure the back of his head, yet a window remains clearly visible in the background. His piano conveniently rests in front of the glass fixture, as if to remind the viewer constantly of his voyeuristic tendencies. Through the consistent, never-ending repetition of such sequences, Malik is typecast into a role: that of the brooding watcher. And who else likes to look forlornly into the distance (preferably at green lights)? Jay Gatsby.
The cinematography further emphasizes the video’s channeling of “The Great Gatsby.” The characters often find themselves overpowered by their surroundings’ grandiose nature. The video achieves this effect through the heavy use of long shots, which allow buildings and objects to fill the frame and thus make the human figures appear smaller. At one moment, Malik almost melts into both his living room’s interior and the window’s reflection of trees and mountains. The result is a sense of vastness, even excessiveness—the latter trait reinforced by costuming. Take the last scene in the video: Malik’s lost love flees, dressed in a flowing chiffon gown that trails behind her. Driving away in fancy evening attire is never practical, but the dress is a statement piece, revealing an unrestrained lavishness behind the video’s story. In a less flashy way, “iT’s YoU” achieves the same effect as Baz Luhrmann’s 2013 film adaptation of the novel (yes, the one with Leonardo DiCaprio): The setting feels extravagant and all-encompassing.
Such prevailing parallels make “iT’s YoU” exude “The Great Gatsby,” so much so that when Malik mopes over his ex-girlfriend, now sitting and chatting with another man at an opulent party, little doubt remains that the new beau represents Gatsby’s rival, Tom Buchanan. So what does this allusion say about “iT’s YoU”? “The Great Gatsby” is a novel about hollowness—of the upper class, of the American Dream, of love even—and “Mind of Mine” is an album meant to be a confessional window into the psyche of a now-solo artist. Put two and two together, and it’s clear that Malik is reflecting on the empty nature of certain relationships in his life (this conclusion fits the contrived and equally empty lyrics accompanying the video).
The video ends with Malik’s love driving away as he merely stares off. While a car ride spells disaster in “The Great Gatsby,” the ambiguous nature of this conclusion is perhaps a sign that Malik will be able to conquer the issues that “iT’s YoU” posits. He is still cruising—still escaping the futile, if wistful, romantic errors that led to Gatsby’s demise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The second season of Marvel's “Daredevil” has been released on Netflix, once more bringing blind justice to slightly-too-aptly-named Hell's Kitchen, New York. Hell's Kitchen in 2016 is thoroughly hip—not nearly as seedy as the series makes it out to be—but its name, at least, plays perfectly with the show's overtly and somewhat oddly religious overtones. Rarely do our superheroes come in the form of semi-martyred blind Catholics masquerading as the "Devil" in "Hell" these days, but Netflix's TV show took its cues from Frank Miller's 1980's “Daredevil” comic book series “Man without Fear,” which defined the superhero in large part by his connection to religion (one story arc was even entitled “Born Again”).
“Daredevil” is the story of Catholic defense attorney Matt Murdock, whom a tragic accident at the age of nine deprived of sight but also endowed with a superhuman heightening of all other senses. He learned to fight from his father, a poverty-stricken professional boxer who was paid to lose matches, and has now grown up to be the embodiment of blind justice in a red leather uniform and a pair of improbable devil's horns nobody, presumably, really takes seriously. Actor Charlie Cox's Murdock is suave but approachable and excels in extended bouts of hand-to-hand combat with up to a dozen trained killers. He cries thinking about his father, never kills people, and is altogether saintly: In the course of persuading the Punisher, a murderous fellow vigilante who has gone off the deep end, that he is in the wrong, he even seems to attempt to bring the man, a Catholic, back into the faith. In one particularly sermon-like speech, he asks the Punisher, "You never stop and think, 'Shit, I just killed a human being?’ A human being who had one small piece of goodness in 'im? Maybe just a scrap, but something.  And then you come along and that one small flicker of light gets snuffed out forever…. You think God made you a one-man firing squad. But you're wrong. There is goodness in people, even in you."
The combination of the series' gritty and often gruesome style—darker than that of most Marvel creations—with this type of painfully melodramatic writing and overtly religious message can be jarring. We are graced with shots of the saintly Murdock and others crudely stitching together their own wounds or beating each other extensively at close range. One particularly charming shot displayed a few teeth, still attached to the gum (and nothing else), buried in the side of a table—original owner nowhere to be found. The aesthetic of Daredevil's dangerous Hell's Kitchen and the cinematography from Martin Ahlgren (of House of Cards) are equally dark: The color palette is largely deep blacks and reds to match Daredevil's uniform, and camera shots don't cut from one dynamic picture to the next, as one might expect from a Marvel creation, but stay in close range, circling the action and not allowing the viewer to miss anything ugly.
Whereas Daredevil himself and his sidekicks—a pudgy, hapless goofball (Elden Henson) and an unreasonably attractive damsel in distress-turned-daring female crime-fighter (Deborah Ann Woll)—can seem like the flat comic-book caricatures they are, the minor characters in the series, emerging from the show's bleak setting, stand out as frankly human and even occasionally realistic. These residents of the fictitiously gruesome Hell's Kitchen ground the series in reality and prevent it from veering off entirely into the world of sermonizing superheroes in technicolor. But perhaps this is merely because they don't speak enough to be flattened by Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez' scripting into two dimensions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, Harvard President Drew Faust traveled to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to give the inaugural Zengerle Family Lecture. Extolling the virtues of a liberal arts education, Faust praised West Point, one of the few colleges in the country (Harvard among them) that continues to promote the humanities. She concluded the speech by saying to the cadets, “I wish there were more of you.”
President Faust was applauded for her visit, particularly on Harvard’s social media accounts, but as a senior at Harvard and an Army ROTC cadet, I was less impressed. While President Faust was quick to reach out to those at West Point, she has been frustratingly slow to respond to the cadets and midshipmen on her own campus. Although Faust deserves much credit for welcoming ROTC back on campus after a 42-year absence—a bold and decisive move—she seems to have quickly forgotten about the cadets and midshipmen who call Harvard home. And whereas her visit to West Point might have been a good faith effort to strengthen relations between the military and Harvard, there is ample room for improvement right here in Cambridge.
Today, there are only 23 cadets and midshipmen who form the ranks of Harvard ROTC, representing just 0.34 percent of the student body. This number has not increased with the recognition of ROTC at Harvard five years ago, suggesting that the change was merely symbolic. Moreover, with a relatively large graduating class of cadets, it looks like Harvard’s ROTC community will shrink in the coming years. This stands in stark contrast to Yale ROTC, which reestablished its program in 2012 and has since seen the program grow from zero cadets and midshipmen to more than 70. After reinstatement, Yale’s administration made ROTC a priority on its campus, by adopting policies to increase the number of students recruited and retained by the ROTC program. Yale has proven itself to be a leader in ways that Harvard has not.
On Memorial Day last year, the Harvard Veterans Organization, in partnership with the Harvard ROTC Association, presented the administration with a comprehensive report of the state of the military at Harvard, including recommendations for increasing the number of cadets and midshipmen at the College. These recommendations include granting course credit for required ROTC classes—a policy adopted by all but one other ROTC program in the country—and making a student’s commitment to ROTC an admissions consideration, just like a commitment to a varsity sports team.
However, despite the fact that relatively minor changes could increase the ROTC population at Harvard by making ROTC participation less time consuming and more feasible for a greater number of students, President Faust has remained silent on the issue. While I doubt that she holds any ill will towards ROTC or the military, it is clear that we are simply not a priority. If President Faust were to give the cadets and midshipmen here on our own campus just a fraction of the time that she spent with cadets at another school, I truly believe we could resolve the issues impeding the growth of our program.
The title of President Faust’s speech at West Point, “To be a Speaker of Words and a Doer of Deeds: Literature and Leadership,” seems ironic. On many occasions, President Faust has voiced support for the presence of the military and ROTC on campus; however, I have personally observed very little action. Indeed, while I am grateful for her efforts to return ROTC to Harvard, it often feels as though that return has been in name alone. President Faust’s suggestion in her speech that we need more military leaders with liberal arts educations adds insult to four years of injury. She urged our peers at the Military Academy to “Lead on behalf of each other. Lead on behalf of the nation.” Many Harvard students, however, are also ready to answer this call to serve. We hope that one day President Faust will be ready to lead on behalf of us.

The “Twilight” series created a worldwide splash when it was first released 11 years ago, setting records as one of the biggest selling novels of 2008. The series’ success can be attributed to its inclusion of vampires and werewolves, but most of all, its depiction of an “instant and eternal attraction” between the dark and mysterious Edward Cullen and the innocent and naive Bella Swan. Twilight is, at its core, supposed to be a love story about two teenagers, one human and one vampire.
However, when we look closely at the story, concerning elements emerge. In “Twilight,” Edward has a habit of sneaking into Bella’s room to watch her sleep. In the books, this is shown as the height of romance. In real life? Not so much.
Edward also damages property when he is angry, physically hurts Bella and leaves marks on her body, routinely scares and intimidates her, controls where she goes and who she talks to, and threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him—all of which are signs, according to the National Domestic Violence hotline, of an emotionally or physically abusive relationship.
More recently, “Fifty Shades of Grey,” the series depicting the romantic BDSM relationship between Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, has also been hailed as a steamy, desirable love story. Though a significant draw is the sexual aspect, most readers agree that they read the book because it is a “classic” romantic fiction.
Once again, however, there are abusive elements within the story wrapped up in a seemingly romantic narrative. Christian once tells Anastasia, “Alaska is very cold and no place to run. I would find you. I can track your cell phone—remember?” Another memorable line is: “He’d probably like to beat seven shades of shit out of me. The thought is depressing.” And yet, Anastasia still thinks of Christian as her perfect lover, her soulmate. What should be seen as unacceptable behavior is instead described as manly and attractive.
In many ways, domestic abuse has been normalized through the pop culture we consume. Men have been socialized to be persistent in their pursuit of women, and women have been socialized to be flattered and touched by his persistence. Studies have shown that when women watch romanticized portrayals of stalking in movies, they are more likely to accept stalking as desirable. The way we have been socialized makes it hard for women to identify abusive behavior as abusive, rather than just an extravagant act of love, and also makes it hard for women to be taken seriously when they are abused.
And while it may be easy to justify psychological abuse, such as stalking and manipulation, as being rooted in love, there should be absolutely no justification for physical abuse. Yet, that is still not the case. When Merrit Smith took her 4-year-old daughter for stitches after she was hit by a boy in her class, a staff member at the hospital reassured the girl, “I bet he likes you.”
The fact that this type of antiquated thinking is still being perpetuated by people is appalling. And even if these people are among the minority, their reinforcement of this line of thinking is insidious nevertheless. The idea that young boys express their affection for young girls by pulling their hair, grabbing them, wrestling them to the ground, and teasing them is nothing new. We are quick to brush off these incidents off with, “He just likes her!” or “That’s just how little boys are when they have a crush!”
But at what point is it no longer acceptable for abuse to be used to express love? At what point does a boy hitting a girl, or a boy following a girl, or a boy mocking a girl, become something that we are concerned about, rather than something we brush off as an act of romance? At what point do we stop romanticizing abuse?
When a kindergarten boy shoves his female classmate, or when a teenage boy reads his girlfriend’s text messages, we find this behavior a little possessive, perhaps, and a little extreme—but it’s romantic, it’s cute, and he clearly cares about her. Yet, when it’s a grown man beating his wife or forbidding her from talking to other men, we suddenly cringe and call it abuse. We draw a line separating love and abuse where there wasn’t one before.
The way we romanticize abusive behavior is dangerous because it normalizes toxic relationships and domestic violence from a very early age. It makes us think that abuse can be okay. It makes us think that abuse can even be romantic. And this makes it hard for domestic violence survivors to identify their partner as abusive, and even harder for them to leave or seek help, because part of them is still not sure whether it’s love or abuse.
Love and abuse: the two are complete opposites. Love is about caring for and supporting someone else and making them happy. Love is not about hurting someone else, or making them unhappy, or causing them pain. That is called abuse. And when we conflate love and abuse, we not only glorify toxic and abusive relationships, but we also undermine the value of strong, healthy, mutually supportive relationships that are truly grounded in love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday at 5 p.m., the Admissions Committee offered 1,119 students the opportunity to join the Harvard College Class of 2020. Alongside the 918 applicants admitted in December, these students will form the most selective class in school history, with only 5.2 percent of more than 39,000 applicants receiving offers of admission.
The admissions statistics are promising in terms of racial and socioeconomic diversity. The percentage of the admitted class that identifies as African American rose from 12.1 to 14 percent, and those identifying as Asian American rose from 21 to 22.1 percent. Furthermore, one fifth of all accepted students come from households earning less than $65,000 per year.
Harvard should continue its push to diversify its student body, as these efforts have contributed to making its undergraduate experience so unique. At the same time, a certain tension will always exist between the goals of having a diverse and inclusive class, and of keeping our community at its current size. As admissions offices at Harvard and other selective schools successfully reach ever more talented students, rates of admission to will inevitably continue to be low. While it is tempting to judge all universities by simple metrics like these admissions statistics, we can only glean so much from these numbers.
In fact, the formulas used to construct college rankings are largely arbitrary. Weighting different factors of the student experience more heavily—for example, valuing cost effectiveness over student-to-teacher ratio—can drastically alter the lists. As a result, universities have discovered a variety of tactics to game these rankings, using loopholes like the fact that U.S. News and World Report does not consider spring enrollment in order to artificially inflate its apparent selectivity.
The most commonly published lists therefore have the effect of creating and reaffirming conventional wisdom about the relative quality of different schools. But they do not reflect quality of education or lifestyle or value for money in a complete way. And at their worst, they can have a detrimental effect, keeping students from asking why they want to attend one school over another. The place where a student will spend four of the most formative years of one’s life deserves more attention than a glance at the rankings. While Harvard and its selective peers are institutions where incredible experiences take place every day, statistics do not do justice to their most crucial qualities. A transformational experience cannot be quantified by statistics.
For this reason, neither students nor admissions officers should give in to the temptation to put too much stock in low acceptance rates. For students, understanding what kind of institution they want for their college experience should be the goal of their decision making process. And while Harvard's admissions office should double down on its commitment to forming the most diverse and accomplished classes possible, it and its counterparts at other institutions should never seek to artificially inflate their applications in order to be competitive in the rankings.
Ultimately, numbers will remain crude measurements of the college experience. Prospective students should focus on finding a meaningful college experience, wherever that may be. Well under 1 percent of college students attend schools as selective as Harvard. Despite its merits, Harvard is not perfect for everyone, even if statistics seem to paint it as such. A fulfilling college experience does not depend on such arbitrary numerical indicators.

The first time someone told me that puns aren’t funny was my senior year of high school. We were studying Shakespeare, and my teacher pointed out that double meanings are frequently employed in the language of Shakespeare’s plays. I had noticed this, too, and thought they were hysterical.
“Of course,” she continued, “they are now considered to be the lowest form of humor, and most people don’t find them amusing.” I mentally hung my head in shame.
When Shakespeare contemplates the family feud between Claudius and Hamlet, he doesn’t just call those characters “kindred,” and leave the actor to add the irony. He considers the whole word visually, and sees within it “kin,” and “kind.” He thinks about how those two words relate within the context of the play—Claudius and Hamlet are kin, as uncle and nephew, stepfather and stepson, and yet the audience knows that they are also related as murderer and avenger. They are kin doubly over, but they are not exactly kind towards one another. He puts this whole thought process into Hamlet’s manic and churning mind, and composes the aside: “A little more than kin, and less than kind.”
For all of the posthumous literary shame that Shakespeare might be afforded for his puns (a significant amount of which, to be fair, are phallic double entendres), they’re still, you know, the work of a genius. To a modern ear, they may slip by unnoticed when recited aloud, but can be better discerned on the page. There, they elicit a belated “hmm” or “ahhh” of recognition—too late for a laugh, but nonetheless a clever creation.  The linguistic trickery, despite its “lowbrow” notoriety, is shrewd and intriguing.
As I’m no Shakespeare, my puns are rarely granted more than a groan, sigh, head smack, or a less-than-occasional “get out.” For as long as I can remember, my relentless punning has been a running joke among my friends. It’s become understood that in any given conversation, I will see some kind of homonymic overlap between something someone has said and the context of the situation. I always feel compelled to point it out, no matter how sheepishly. It’s been called my “Tumblr talk,” or a “pun processor” lodged in my brain with the switch permanently stuck to “on.” My impulse to make puns in social situations is primarily due to their sonic and contextual nature—if I don’t say one I’ve just thought of right here, right now, then the joke is lost forever. I strike out more often than not, but I’m incentivized by the rare times I hit a home pun.
I can see why puns are despised. Something is considered funny when it is incongruous with its context, a subversion of expectations. Puns undermine the listener’s comprehension—they make us believe we have understood one meaning of a phrase or sentence, only to see the second, certainly sillier connotation a (crucial) moment too late. The set up is either strained, or doesn’t exist at all. By their very nature, puns are forced, and blatantly intentional. A July 2015 Atlantic article entitled “Why Do Puns Make People Groan?” explains that puns demand a response, whether it is good or bad. As author Julie Beck points out, “I see what you did there” can go either way. Perhaps, the average “punster” just comes across as a scheming and interrupting attention-seeker.
I have invoked enough emergency nonsequiturs and shaky “AMIRITE?”s in social situations to testify that all of these things are definitively true. And yet, I still love puns. I suppose I view and comprehend speech as a kind of puzzle—albeit one of those thousand-piece puzzles you only attempt on a rainy vacation with your parents. Each hole in the puzzle is clearly designed for a specific piece to fit in it, but what if the puzzle piece that’s tantalizingly close at hand almost, but not quite, fits into the hole? You would laugh, perhaps genuinely, mostly with pity, at an adorable child attempting to shove the wrong piece into the right hole. I am that child, and, yes, I’m adorable.
To me, discovering “30 Rock” was akin to some kind of spiritual of awakening. The Facebook feature that allows you to tag just someone’s first or last name, thus enabling me to insert said names into similar-sounding words, was likely engineered just for my sense of humor, and for the bane of everyone on my Newsfeed. I think a number of the people in my life might rue the day I downloaded the Hamilton soundtrack. I couldn’t tell you exactly when or how my punning began, but I do recall that as an (actual) child, I tended to take everything very literally—sarcasm came later to me, and sticks and stones were often preferable to the words of schoolchildren. My puns, I’ve theorized, are a way to make a game out of the speech that flies carelessly out of mouths and implant, sometimes unsettlingly, into the ears of those around us. If each word can be just as easily replaced with another, especially with one that sounds exactly the same but means something totally different—a joke, even—then not every casually flung phrase could hold the weight its flinger bestowed upon it.
A few weeks ago my roommate pointed me to an article brazenly entitled “Sometimes Puns Are a Sign of a Damaged Brain.” Great, I thought; my punning has pathology. Closer examination (read: I actually read it) of the article revealed that an unfortunate man in Germany was diagnosed with “Witzelsucht,” (a word just begging for dissection) or “joke addiction.” Damage left by an unnoticed stroke caused him to constantly make nonsensical jokes, compulsively, to the point that he would wake up his extremely annoyed wife in the middle of the night to run them by her. Thankfully, the jokes themselves were not puns in particular—the headline merely saw an opportunity to poke fun at the most hated part of comedy.
Though I usually avoid the comments section of the Internet as a rule, I scrolled down to see what others thought of the bombastic title. They were indignant, sometimes cruel to the author, and filled with puns. (“I’d like to give this brain doctor a piece of my mind!” crowed one (4/10.)) They were exactly the kind of remarks that I expected, though I felt annoyed, too, on behalf of my fellow punsters, and condoned the Internet trolling for once. My kin, I believe, were in this instance allowed to be less than kind.

Ever since Freudian and Jungian dream psychoanalysis lost favor in America, dreams have been considered unimportant and bizarre. Our technological and scientific age doesn’t see meaning in them, but this was not always the case. Professor of the Comparative and Historical Study of Religion Kimberley C. Patton ’80, who teaches the course “Dreams and Dreaming” at Harvard Divinity School, answered a few questions about the role dreams played in earlier, more religious cultures.
Fifteen Minutes: I see your class covers a number of different roles for the dream in religion, including initiatory experiences, metaphors for aboriginal time, gateways to the other world.... If you had to pick one role that you found most interesting or most significant to your work, what would it be?
Kimberley C. Patton: First of all, whether dreams have meaning is a very controversial subject in a more scientifically or technologically oriented society like ours. There’s little interest in dreams…. Dreams have more emotional intensity. They seem to be bizarre. They switch scenarios. Not only do people appear differently and speak differently, even people you might know, but we aren’t even ourselves. This has been commented on from the time of the ancient Greeks all the way up to Freud.
FM: It is not so much that they have meaning, but that we give them meaning? That’s what religion might say.
KP: Religion says they have meaning. So, religious traditions... see dreams as a place for us to have access to another world that is not unreal. In fact, many traditions see it as more real. But it is a place that one cannot necessarily experience... you can meet the dead. You can meet spiritual teachers, encounter realities, monsters, demons.... You can live another life. For example, in Hinduism, it’s kind of a parallel world, but it’s not seen as unreal.
FM: Can you expand on that? 
KP: [Hindu beliefs reveal] the fact that the waking life is a place of illusion as well. There’s this notion of maya, which is translated as “unreality,” but that’s not exactly right. It points to the fact that we think we are sitting here, but that is something that is being dreamed by the God Vishnu, so we are all being dreamed by a god. In Hindu accounts of dreams, one can become someone else. A beggar can become a king, or a king a beggar. Then, when you wake up, unless one is having a lucid dream, that experience feels very real, which is why someone like Descartes believed in using dreams as evidence for thinking about reality.… Christianity has had a pretty ambivalent attitude towards dreaming.
FM: Why has Christianity been ambivalent?
KP: Well, it started out with a general Mediterranean view of dreaming which other people share; the Greeks, the Romans… which is that dreams could definitely provide a means of divine revelation or be instructive…. Then in early Christian accounts, you see that very positive attitude towards dreams, like we were talking about, they let you experience, for example, life after death….  By the fifth century… [The] Church, which has become more hierarchical, is starting to become worried that anyone can claim to have a dream and say that they see a revelation. They can see a different way of understanding Christ…. We have these documents from the fifth century from a  Coptic Church in Egypt that say unless your dreams corroborate what’s in the scripture, [it’s] not true. If people start having dreams that seem to undermine these canonical understandings, they become threatening to the political structure of the Church.
Around that time, monks start going out into the desert and Augustin is writing. That’s when you start to see an awareness that the self in the dream can’t be controlled in the same way that the self in the waking-world can.
FM: In terms of sin? As in you go in your dream and commit a sin?
KP: Yes, you have sex. Especially for men; nightdreams, wet dreams. These are hugely problematic because Christianity is increasingly stressing sexual abstinence and purity. That’s a huge issue… the way that it wasn’t, for example, in Judaism or other religions.
FM: What are you hoping to accomplish by asking your students to keep a dream journal throughout your course?
KP: I have them keep a dream journal because I want them first of all to have the experience of trying to remember the dreams and paying attention to them.... What we have is waking up feeling weird, shaken up, maybe [having] seen someone who’s died or done something you’d never do, and we kind of shake it off and go on with our day. It is not productive to focus on it. I want my students to set that aside and pay attention to their dreams... that automatically gets them into the mindset of the traditions we are studying.... I do want them to attend to the dreams that are coming up. I don’t read them; it’s personal. But I want them to see what’s coming up.

BEN: Despite running on an on ­and ­off schedule for the past several weeks, and causing tens of people to say “What’s that?” when prompted, Ben and Andrew has not been raking in as many clicks as we would have hoped. But then again, many great writers weren’t appreciated in their own time.
ANDREW: Renowned lyricist Rebecca Black comes to mind.
BEN: So we decided to embrace our Great Writer aesthetic. I went out and bought a wardrobe that focused primarily on the color black. Andrew leaned his head against a window and watched the raindrops slide down the glass.
ANDREW: We knew we needed to channel some of the best artists in history—people like Van Gogh, Hemingway, and Edgar Allen Poe. But people like this only had one thing in common: absinthe.
BEN: So we decided to drink a shit­-ton of it.
ANDREW: Ben!
The sound of frantic whispering. The word “mom” is emphasized urgently, and repeatedly.
BEN: Sorry, I have a cold. I meant to say—we decided to not drink a shit­-ton of absinthe.
ANDREW: You know, to not sin.
BEN: If there’s one thing synagogue taught me, it’s to love Jesus, go to Mass, and not drink absinthe to ascend to the next level of artistic vision.
ANDREW: Amen.
BEN: So on Thursday night, we obviously were not at the liquor store looking at the scant selection of absinthe there. Some fun facts I never learned about the drink—the hallucinogenic properties are attributed to a compound called thujone, which is derived from wormwood. Claims of psychedelic effects are made mostly by people who later cut their own ears off, so take them with a grain of salt. Unfortunately for our quest for Greatness, thujone is banned above a negligible concentration in the United States. So we didn’t have to settle for buying something that the subreddit r/absinthe terms “undrinkable swill.”
ANDREW: To be fair, for people who aren’t used to drinking warm PBR, “undrinkable swill” is definitely a step up.
BEN: That brought us to Friday night.
ANDREW: Gotta get down on Friday!
BEN: Right. So, anyway, on Friday we found ourselves—
ANDREW: Partyin’ partyin’ (Yeah!)
BEN: Exactly. I don’t know how absinthe is prepared, but if I were to guess, I would imagine it is a strangely involved, somewhat contrived­-feeling process that involves us using sugar cubes, syringes for slowly doling out drips of cold water, and specially grated “absinthe spoons.”
ANDREW: I too am unsure. I would also imagine, however, that the only STEM concentrator on FM needed to snag some pipettes from Chem 27 lab in order to accomplish this process.
BEN: You have quite the active imagination, Andrew.
ANDREW: Especially when I don’t drink absinthe.
BEN: Absinthe is not not a drink for the classic college party. We weren’t bombarded with questions like “What are you doing?”, “Why do you have a syringe?”, and “Are you single?”
ANDREW: On an unrelated note, I am single.
BEN: You are not single; you mean.
ANDREW: But I was the one who wasn’t so impatient with the slow process that he didn’t pregame the absinthe with other beverages.
BEN: Wait. Wouldn’t it be—“I was the one who wasn’t so impatient with the slow process that he did pregame the absinthe with other beverages.”
ANDREW: That’s deep.
BEN: Absinthe, to the best of our recollections, doesn’t taste like a cup of liquor had a midnight tryst with a bag of licorice.
ANDREW: But Ben, did it make us better writers? Have we joined the ranks of Hemingway, Poe, and Black?
BEN: That’s a good question. I guess we can look at my texts from that evening. One sec...
1:23 a.m. “Heey”
1:23 a.m. “HYEYYYEY”
1:24 a.m. “can i smke a napppkn???”
1:43 a.m. “bt like fir realk”
BEN: I dunno that looks pretty good to me.
ANDREW: Ooh let me check mine...
1:47 a.m. “I can’t think”
1:47 a.m. “Guxjed in”
1:49 a.m. “Tucked up”
1:50 a.m. “The world is quite fluid”
BEN: Step aside, Greats, we’re breaking into the scene soon with our tell­-all ­novel—All Guxjed In with Nothing to Smke, The Ben and Andrew Story.
ANDREW: Tune in next time to see us not do crack!
BEN: Wait, but we’re actually not doing crack, right?
ANDREW: Riiiight.

"I believe in you."
It was late August, the day before I was due to leave home for college. My mom watched me pack my bags. I wavered over one item before placing it back into my closet.
"It will be hard sometimes, but you have to believe in yourself too."
I packed my bags with articles of clothing, yes, but also with hopes and dreams and with beliefs—about what my future held in store for me, about who I was and who I wanted to be.
My parents packed their bags too. But, while I was embarking upon a trail to adulthood, to college and the years beyond, they were heading for a family outing—for the first time ever, without me.
I packed my bags with expectations. They packed theirs with memories, tracing my first few words to the present moment, in which I declared my independence by deciding to make the trip on my own.
I would be leaving the city alone; I felt it was fitting. But as I reached for articles of clothing, I couldn't help but recount all the memories I was taking with me. I packed the shirt I wore when I had my first kiss, the dress I wore on my first date, the pants that will forever remind me of a summer afternoon when I strolled through my neighborhood shortly before I moved. I went through countless sweaters tied to family memories, events so precious they were tattooed firmly into the folds of my brain.
I kept my gaze directed at the pile of fabric under my fidgeting hands to keep my mom from noticing the sudden welling of my eyes. Here were the physical manifestations of all the memories of my childhood. Shuffling through my wardrobe felt like I was scrolling through an album. I grabbed a couple of sweaters and realized that I was holding many years in my grasp. I sifted through memories, carefully selecting some, folding them gently into my suitcase, and leaving others.
I believed I could do it alone; I was so ready to go forth and become my own person, free from the influence of my parents. But, recognizing that my mom believed in me reaffirmed my suspicion that, no matter how much I told myself I wanted to do this, I still did not believe in myself.
The packing felt so familiar. Years before, I had moved from Tashkent, Uzbekistan to New York. Then, like now, my clothes were dispersed into tangled bundles all over the room. The only difference now was that I, not my parents, decided what would be traveling with me.
After moving to the United States, I unconsciously tried my best to make myself as different from my parents as possible. Conversations over dinner morphed from lively chatters in Russian to quick exchanges between my siblings and me in English. For the first few years, my parents struggled to keep up with our pace, and the language barrier began to create a rift that seemed to only widen as cultural differences between our generations became more apparent. I tried to give up as much of my past as possible in order to quickly assimilate into my new community here; my parents reminisced about family and the traditions of home.
I was carrying that same sentiment with me into college: I wanted to redefine myself, to morph into the context of my new home.
The following morning, my mom dropped me off in front of the bus station. I placed my overflowing suitcase into the storage area and boarded a bus headed to Cambridge. As I made my way down the aisle to find a seat, I had a realization, in the dramatic way that people undergoing big changes do.
No matter what I carried with me into and out of college and the years beyond, the memories that have shaped me to this moment would always be with me, silently defining all my actions, lurking and mingling with newfound experiences and eventually settling with the dust of the carefully chosen fabrics in my personal closet.
Now, in the spring of my freshman year, as I get ready to move back home, I will begin packing again. This time, my suitcase will be a little heavier with the memories I’ve accumulated in my two semesters here. I will pack my dress from convocation, the crimson scarf I bought for Harvard-Yale, countless new sweaters, gloves and other things.
Most importantly, I’ll pack a realization: No matter how I change over the next few years, I’ll carry with me the fundamental memories that help me define and believe in who I am.

In many ways, it is just like any other evening at the eclectic Harvard Square mainstay Clover Food Lab. Flannel-clad, dreadlock-sporting 20-somethings mix breezily with briefcase-toting button-ups. The restaurant’s chipper staff affably fields orders for its locavore offerings, and a somewhat bemused group of new customers stands around trying to make sense of the eatery’s unusual ordering system.
But tonight is louder, boozier, and more emotional: Clover is holding a “farewell party” to say goodbye to its location at 7 Holyoke St. in the Smith Campus Center.
Hints of nostalgia abound in the industrial-themed, spartanly decorated restaurant. A shaky handheld video of the restaurant’s first day of business plays in a loop on wall-mounted televisions. A circuitous timeline covers one of the walls, recounting Clover’s short but environmentally-sustainable history.
As I wade through the motley crowd of Cloverites enjoying beer and vegetarian fare, my ears are graced with the melody of a live band twanging the dulcet tones of Pure Prairie League’s “Amie” on banjo and fiddles from Clover’s mezzanine.
As a frequent patron of Clover—the first restaurant I ever ate at in Harvard Square—I share the nostalgia of the employees, customers, and members of the wider Clover community exchanging hugs over the lilt of soft rock. 
Suspecting that the staff shares my gnawing sense of sentimentality, I track down Lucia Jazayeri, Clover’s Director of Communications, to ask her how she feels about the move.
“I’m getting kind of sad now,” Jazayeri says, glancing up from her work on a Clover-themed photo montage. But Jazayeri says she is optimistic about HSQ2—the name of Clover’s new Harvard Square location—and notes the 1326 Massachussets Avenue address’s historic value.
The new location’s tilework is original, dating back 103 years, to the days of the historic Waldorf cafeteria, an eatery founded in 1913 and popular with undergrads through the 1950s. The new location opened Tuesday.
Though Clover’s history is much shorter, it’s inspired its share of loyal customers, according to Jazayeri.
“I was taking orders today and I met a couple of customers that have been eating with us since the beginning,” Jazayeri says. “Just random people in line that have literally been coming here for the past five years.”
One of such faithful customers is Troy Schuler, a skinny-framed, mop-headed Law School graduate who fits the Clover mold well. He tells me that he used to patronize the restaurant about three times a week in his Law School days.
“I took multiple exams here—eight-hour take-homes—so I have a lot of attachment to this space,” Schuler says. 
While it may seem an odd place for a take-home (the brutalist, concrete Smith center is far from inviting), Clover manages to maintain a cozy ambience. A long-time employee tells me that the ivy covering the back wall dates back to the restaurant’s first days, and exists only as the result of diligent and loving employee care. The other walls are covered by children’s drawings, many of which mention Clover. “I can’t eat your food…. But I love the smell,” proclaims a hungry robot, who spares the restaurant its mechanical fury.
Perhaps none are as distraught by Clover’s move as the 51 undergraduate members of Clover Watch, a Groupme dedicated to all things Clover.
On the day of the closing, one heartbroken member of Clover Watch posted a photograph of a tall cup of Clover’s signature lemonade bearing a “HSQ1 Becomes HSQ2” sticker.
“Bittersweet :/ (not the lemonade, that shit is great) but gah hsq2’s gonna be tiiiiiiny,” reads the caption of the photo, a copy of which was obtained by The Crimson.

Between 8:40 and 8:45 a.m., students and community members pack themselves into the pews of Memorial Church’s Appleton Chapel. Some students rush in at the last minute with wet or uncombed hair. They’re here for morning prayer, a tradition that stretches back almost 400 years to the College’s founding. Yet this morning’s service bears little resemblance to its original form. Its evolution mirrors the College’s gradual response to a student body with changing demands.
In Harvard’s early years, mandatory morning services and evening services were held in small groups in tutors’ chambers. Later in the 17th century, the college held prayer gatherings for the entire student body, led by the president and his close affiliates.
In those days, undergraduate attendance was no joke. “Any undergraduate comes tardy to prayers (without reasons allowed by the president or tutor),” stated the College’s Board of Overseers, “he shall be fined two-pence. And if he be absent from prayers without reasons as aforesaid, he shall be fined four-pence each time.”
This strict policy towards morning prayer attendance was partly justified by the College’s founding emphasis on religious education. However, early Harvard presidents saw another purpose towards compulsory attendance—it was a way to maintain order on campus. They reasoned that churchgoing students were less likely to commit crimes. And they kept those who did attend services on their toes: An 1883 Crimson article cites records of three students “publickly admonished in The Hall for drinking rum (forbidden by the college laws) in the college, and for making disorderly noises in the college at or near midnight.”
A century later, students were relieved when the administration finally began to rethink its policies. President Charles W. Eliot observed no “moral or disciplinary relapse” when morning prayer was suspended for five months in the 1870s for repairs on Appleton Chapel, the predecessor of Memorial Church. He was receptive to the idea of making attendance voluntary, and helped student petitioners attain their desired policy change. By 1886, morning prayer attendance was no longer mandatory.
Reverend Francis G. Peabody, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at the time of the change, supported Eliot’s decision. Conducting compulsory services, he said, reminded him of his time spent preaching at the state prison.
Even with optional services, the debate over the role of religion on campus wasn’t finished. It flared up again in the 1920s and 30s, sparked by the construction of Memorial Church. By this time, diversity at Harvard was on the rise, and many opposed the idea of having only a Protestant church on campus as opposed to an interdenominational space. Others believed it was important to have a Protestant chuch as a recognition of Harvard’s religious history.
Further, Memorial Church was built to commemorate the lives of students who passed away during World War I. Some alumni wrote to complain that they would rather have a memorial swimming pool than a memorial church.
Tradition ultimately prevailed: Memorial Church was built as, and remains, a Protestant space of worship. Yet in the hundred years of its existence, its clergy have recognized the importance of Harvard’s growing diversity. This can be seen in the church’s selection of morning prayer speakers: “We’ve been really making an effort to have people come speak from a wide range of backgrounds,” Memorial Church Ministry Fellow Alanna Copenhaver says. These range from Harvard professors, to union workers, to longtime church attendees.
And even Harvard students. The old practice of publicly shaming students during morning prayer is long gone: Students are now encouraged to share their stories. This practice isn’t meant to solicit public admonishment, but to inspire listeners. Copenhaver describes services as “a space where we meet on a daily basis to reflect on our shared humanity.”
This fits nicely with a common saying among Memorial Church staff: “Everyone may not belong to Mem Church, but Mem Church belongs to everyone.”
Balancing tradition and religious inclusion remains different, though. “We have a lot of conversations about how to navigate that,” Copenhaver says. That’s a very live conversation, not just about morning prayer, but also Memorial Church in general.”
“[Harvard is] really rooted in tradition,” she concludes. “But also open to change.”

“I firmly believe that a good steak is a transcendent experience,” a woman in red lipstick declares.
“If you never knew steak, you wouldn’t crave it,” counters a woman in black-framed glasses, the lone vegetarian in the room.
“Well yeah, but then you’d just be spiritually deprived.”
This exchange is set in a sunny space on JFK St., the meeting room of Harvard Square’s Humanist Hub—a self-described “3200 sq. feet of Godless Congregation.” On Friday afternoons at 5 p.m., the space lends itself to the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics (HCHAA, pronounced “ha-chaa”), a group of undergraduates who gather to discuss various topics as secular thinkers. This week’s conversation focuses on the secular ethics of vegetarianism.
HOWDY HEATHENS
“Howdy heathens,” begins an email detailing an upcoming HCHAA meeting.
Most messages sent over the HCHAA listserv start this way and are characterized by similarly playful irreverence. (The email announcing the discussion of vegetarianism ended with “Hail Seitan!”) Although HCHAA meetings often cover serious matters of the human condition, the group maintains a lighthearted air.
“We do have a tongue-in-cheek way of going about it,” Quinn Sluzenski ’18, HCHAA’s outreach director, says. “In a lot of places, there is a stigma against humanism and atheism, and it’s our way of reclaiming that and saying, ‘Okay, we’re heathens, but we’re also good people.’”
HCHAA president Darius Altman ’17 says that the group actively avoids the stereotypes of “militant atheism.” Instead, HCHAA focuses on building a social organization of like-minded people.
“It’s really about getting to know other people,” Altman says. “It’s a community for the sake of having a community.”
HCHAA’s membership includes undergraduates from a plethora of backgrounds. While some members come from atheist and agnostic households, many, according to Sluzenski, were raised in religious families and are not yet “out” of the atheistic closet.
“Our HCHAA camping trip fell on Easter weekend,” Sluzenski recalls. “There were some members that had to leave early to go to church with their families.”
The camping trip, nicknamed “HCHAAmping,” is one of the group’s many traditions. Other special events include a secular seder at the beginning of Passover, a ceremony for HCHAA’s cultural humanism award, and a December celebration of Festivus, the secular holiday created on “Seinfeld.” On a more regular basis, members meet for Friday discussions and enjoy more casual social events called “HCHAAppy Hours.”
THE HUMANIST RABBI
A bronze Gandhi bust peeks out curiously from a table on the other side of the couch. A pair of foam Hulk fists sits next to Gandhi, perhaps raised in an display of civil disobedience rather than superhuman strength. The shelves are lined with novelties—a balloon animal, a Martin Luther King bobblehead—and books with titles like “After Buddhism” and “A God That Could Be Real.” Tucked away in a small corner of the Humanist Hub, Greg M. Epstein’s office is something of a shrine to secular thought. 
For the past decade, Epstein, an ordained Humanist Rabbi, has served as the Humanist Chaplain at Harvard and as a faculty adviser to HCHAA. He also authored a bestselling book called “Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe.” An influential voice in the national conversation about atheism, Epstein is attuned to developments in the greater humanist movement as well as the humanist presence at Harvard.
“It’s really important to me that students here use the space here to figure out what it means to live a good life and be a good human being,” Epstein says.
According to Epstein, HCHAA’s focus has changed since he first began advising the group. When conversations about secularism first gained national attention in the early 2000s, members of HCHAA were more concerned with activism and spreading secular ideas. Since then, community building has become more of a priority.
“The focus is now, ‘How can we provide a support network for them in the same way that a traditional church or congregation of any other kind might provide?’” Epstein says.
HCHAA boasts another high-profile faculty adviser: Steven A. Pinker, the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology, who first met Epstein when he received the Humanist of the Year award in 2006. Pinker often speaks at HCHAA events and welcomes students to chat with him in his office.
“The humanist community serves some of the functions of a religious community—camaraderie, shared purpose, even rituals and communal gatherings—without all of the theological baggage,” Pinker says.
Epstein and Pinker both identify a notable growth in the humanist presence at Harvard, especially since the establishment of a physical home for secular thought. However, as one could expect from an academic institution, humanist thought is prevalent, even if people do not necessarily self-identify as humanists or secularists. Pinker says that there is not a strong humanist presence among faculty, although many professors are “humanists by default.”
“They’re rationalist—most scientists are atheists, at least those at the top of their field,” Pinker says.
Pinker, who was raised as a Reform Jew but calls himself an atheist, did not identify as a humanist until he received an award from the American Humanist Association.
“It’s kind of like the character in the Molière play who is delighted to discover that he has been speaking prose all of his life,” Pinker recalls. “Even before I self-identified as a humanist, I guess I was one.”
THE SALAD PEOPLE
At 5 p.m. on Friday, the table is set with a small feast of Trader Joe’s snacks (HCHAA’s food is funded by the Humanist Hub), and four members sit in a circle, ready to talk about vegetarianism in the secular community.
The woman in red lipstick acts as a moderator of the discussion. She asks, “What is the ethical foundation of your diet?”
Although the members seem to agree that vegetarianism is disproportionately common among secular people, only one person in the room keeps a meat-free diet.
“I think a good meal can have as good an effect as a church service,” one member says, justifying his choice to eat meat.
“These salad people… I sympathize, and I wish them good work,” offers another carnivore.
The lone vegetarian cites unethical farming and environmental concerns as her reason for sticking to vegetables.
“I like people,” she says. “But we’re bad at having a planet.”
The conversation quickly shifts to the class implications of secularism and vegetarianism. One person says that secular and vegetarian populations are overwhelmingly college-educated, wealthy, and white. Another says that they “have the money to be ethical,” spending impressive amounts on environmentally-friendly food and travel. The discussion naturally moves to the closing of Clover, Harvard Square’s favorite purveyor of “fancy lettuce,” according to one member.
The small handful of attendees grows as the meeting goes on. The conversation becomes deeper after one member raises the issue of heart disease in association with consumption of red meat.
“I think a great part of the human condition is doing things that aren’t ‘productive,’” responds another member, making air quotes with a dramatic flourish of his hands. He denounces the common fixation on prolonging life. “What’s the point of living extra if you’re just eating soy beans and doing your job?”
The meeting ends with a question of the members’ duties as secular people.
“Because we lack cultural constraints that dictate our diets, do we have more responsibility to think about the ethics of what we eat?” the moderator asks. “Is there a higher standard for critical thought if you are secular?”
The participant who referred to vegetarians as “salad people” thinks that the absence of religion should not give atheists additional obligations.
“To be secular is a negative choice, not a positive one,” he says.
The moderator retorts, “Not if you’re sitting here.”

Exhausted. Frustrated. Unmotivated. Overwhelmed. Lonely. Or, yeah, hungry. We all spend a lot of time with ourselves, and we all know what those conditions are that make us not able to be our best selves at work, at school, or in interpersonal relationships.
A big part of my life in my past few years of education and work has been striking a good balance between “pushing myself”: giving up sleep, exercise, or time with friends to accomplish something, and “self-care”: a buzzword-y term that’s widely circulating online right now that refers to using time for one’s own well-being. Somehow, a short heart-to-heart with a friend over lunch and skipping a whole day of work to binge-watch Broad City have both been labeled “self-care” by different corners of the Internet. As I’m sure most of us have gathered in our 20-odd years of life, it’s not healthy to never rest or do things that help you recover and feel whole, but it’s also impossible to do well at chipping away at long-term goals if we’re constantly kicking back with movies and glasses of wine in the name of “self-care.” From working on your art to finishing a lab experiment to logging enough work hours to pay a big fat bill, most goals necessitate sacrifice.
Sometimes, balancing self-care and work is very user-friendly: If you want to get the grade, you’d better show up for the test. Sometimes, though, it’s less obvious. Anxious and depressive thoughts only heighten my feelings of personal frustration and my tendency to self-diagnose failure, which keeps me from relaxing OR accomplishing. Did I really “mess up” a huge assignment by going for a run and taking a shower instead of typing away all morning in last night’s pajamas? Would I really be better off if I’d pulled an all-nighter applying to every job on the Career Services website, regardless of their connection to my qualifications, interests, and goals?
A couple years ago, I overheard a conversation that changed my conception of self-care and its relation to accomplishment during my dinner shift at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. My volunteer supervisor was talking to a guest, a woman new to the shelter, with weathered cheeks peeking out from above her big black fleece jacket. As I passed by with a tray of food, I overheard my supervisor reassuringly telling her, “It’s okay! It would be nearly impossible for you to get a job when you haven’t eaten, showered, or slept inside in days.”
I wish more people saw homelessness this way: If you, hypothetical American who most likely has a job and a warm bed, feel like a frazzled mess before your first cup of morning Starbucks, how is it fair for you to tell a homeless person they’re simply lazy, and need to “get it together” and get a job? But this nugget of wisdom has also altered how I interact with myself, as well as my friends, classmates, and coworkers. If someone’s basic physical and psychological needs aren’t being met, it is unfair of me (or anyone) to expect them to do their best work. For this reason, it is important to both evaluate and communicate my own needs, and equally important to be sure I’m being in-tune to what others may need.
After 21 years in my own body and mind, I know some basic things I need to function best: six to eight hours of sleep, breakfast, comfortable clothes and footwear, my prescribed meds for depression and asthma, respect from my co-workers, a balance of social time and solitude, a healthy level of engagement in tasks. As I seek a postgrad job, I’m weighing a lot of bigger options with more implications about what makes me feel fulfilled and able to be productive. It may not be possible for me to live near a forest (the way I grew up, and the way I feel most healthy) while taking the kind of job I want to take: I’ll likely end up in a big city. It may not be possible for me to live on the salary of a single job in the arts, no matter how intellectually nor emotionally fulfilling the work is, so I may need to structure time for a restaurant or retail job into my next life phase along with my nine-to-five.
I am also trying to expand my personal awareness into being better in-tune with what my friends, classmates, and coworkers need. I don’t want people who are feeling unwell (physically or mentally) to be put out of their comfort zones because I am not paying enough attention to their needs. I want to be sure the people I interact with feel their personal strengths and ideas are being treated as relevant and useful. I don’t like the idea that these sorts of frames of mind are elements of “leadership”; They are, but I don’t think one needs to be any sort of a “leader” to be observant, communicative, or a listener (though I sincerely hope leaders are working to be all of these things). Respect is as vital to quality work as it is to formation of community or relationships.
If you’d told me during my freshman fall that as a senior I’d be writing to the whole Internet about being depressed/anxious, I would have thought you were 100 flavors of crazy. But the past four years have given me a lot of chances to expand my capacities for openness, open-mindedness, and articulation, and constant exposure to great writing and people hasn’t hurt. Since I’m not “me” when I haven’t exercised, I’m going to sign off now, both from this column and my wonderful stint at The Crimson.

“She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxicabs, of being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day.” —Virginia Woolf, "Mrs. Dalloway"
While choosing classes this January, a friend saw the end of her life. Selecting a med-school course, she explained, would lock her in for patient care; one on bioinformatics meant a fast-track to industry. She listed electives in choked tones. Dozens of English and Philosophy syllabi would remain unread, each an alternative identity receding before her. Knowledge, she said, seemed for the first time finite; each course could only signal the thousand she had failed to take, a series of fractal-lives slain in a single plan of study. Our conversation turned to death: to fatal illness, contingency plans and our mutual sense of an ending. At 21, we had become two Mrs. Dalloways nearing our demise, though Woolf’s protagonist had lived more than twice our dangerous days.
In the following months, I have tried to discern why we felt and feel so old: why HAA membership smacks of the AARP; why my friends talk of penultimate experiences as if commencement will bring coffins, not diplomas; why I perceive habits and flippant acts ossifying into destiny. Woolf’s work offers me a clue: She defines age by the number of forking life paths we perceive before us at any moment. Youth is the sense that our existence can play out on endless wandering roads, but the fewer we see, the more we age. To visualize a lone route before us is to become unspeakably old. And since graduation confronts us with that singular trajectory, I begin to think of college seniority as a heuristic for real seniority. My mind’s texture feels more and more like "Mrs. Dalloway": precarious and weighty, distant and fraught.
I spy age in my language, in the way I’ve slipped into the truisms of nostalgia. These are the phrases adults would recite as I left high school—a collection of stock words I could not stand. Yet I catch myself saying “make the most of each moment” to underclassmen, when I’d have been repulsed by those same formulations three years before. Woolf speaks of youth far better: “What lark, what a plunge!”—a day whose cusp offers the escapade, the daring dive. My sophomore year, a professor told me I could never understand Vladimir Nabokov’s "Ada or Ardor" until I’d passed 30—because only then would I have internalized the burden of time. But when I hear my words these days, I sense the hour’s provisional grip. Lowell’s bell-tones are physical and weighty, a Cantabrigian analog to Big Ben’s irrevocable leaden circles: They are darkening the forking paths one by one.
The routes brighten when I hear an elder perspective, when I swap compers for professors or visit New York for the weekend. At faculty dinner, a grad student illuminates alternatives with an anecdote: Mid-March as a junior, she ripped out the pages of the textbooks she’d need for final papers and bought a ticket to Europe. She studied abroad senior fall, came back for a glancing graduation, yet her world has not fallen apart. She is there, brilliant and beaming, fluent in French, writing a dissertation as she wanders a picaresque path that, to me, seemed long-veiled. Routes reopen before me; I feel the flutter of youth’s lark once more.
But days pass, and my eye moves farther out at sea. Polemics on campus politics feel frivolous; the weekend’s bacchanal frenzy becomes a flippant option on a tiresome circuit. I enter a stoicism both freeing and dulling: Events good and bad flatten into unending monotony. I understand what Joan Didion said when she fled New York: “Everything that was said to me I seemed to have heard before, and I could no longer listen.” Instead of Woolf’s taxicabs, I watch the paths tread by underclassmen, repetitions of destinies I can no longer regain.
The distance brings Clarissa's words back to me: “Did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely? All this must go on without her; did she resent it; or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely?” I too am becoming spectral, my absolute Harvard-end eased by staying aloof. Age’s glasses may be rose in hindsight, but when mine look on the present, more often they are made of jade.
These moments of senescence define some crucial part of senior spring. Our time is told in linear events—a thesis, a spring break, a graduation—but I feel it differently: as a constant oscillation between youth and age. I am bouncing between exaltation and apathy, seeing the dimming paths as parlous, then all the same.
This time is dialectic, so I tell my friend I am working on my carpe diem calibration. We will not die tomorrow—the senior heuristic is only a heuristic—but we feel the rub of finitude all the same. Marcel Proust wrote, “I think that life would suddenly seem wonderful to us if we were threatened to die”; Martin Heidegger believed authentic Being meant Being-toward-death. So at times I feel blessed that the weeks before graduation have become a microcosm for mortality—a petite mort in which we dream of Widener petites morts. My friend and I grasp at the grain of age, but the lark’s peril still lies in our reach.
We may begin to understand Mrs. Dalloway at last. She too “felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged.”

There is, unsurprisingly, very little traffic at the intersection of Kirkland Street and Divinity Avenue on a gloomy Friday evening in late March. Gray figures cloaked in raincoats stream out of William James Hall. The tires of my bike screech atop the damp pavement.
Past the two stone lions guarding the entrance of 2 Divinity Avenue, the building’s lobby is hushed. A small group of students stands in a circle holding hands, praying quietly with their heads bowed.
But people buzz inside Yenching Auditorium. Dozens of students stream in, greeting one another and embracing friends. There is shouting and hollering and palpable excitement for the coming weekend. A myriad of outfits are present. Some students are smartly attired in blazers and chinos, others in athletic practice gear. A few dig into salads and sandwiches; this is Harvard, after all, and dinner is nothing if not a meal that can be consumed in a meeting or on the move.
I take a seat in the back. It’s a few minutes past 7:30 p.m. on Good Friday, and Harvard College Faith and Action (HCFA) is about to begin its weekly worship meeting, Doxa.
Two student leaders, Alan and Michelle, approach the mic and welcome the crowd (somewhere between 70 and 100 people, according to my imprecise estimate) to this week’s Doxa. A Greek word meaning “glory” or “praise,” doxa is commonly used in philosophy or sociology to refer to implicit common beliefs or opinions, especially those that are unstated or taken for granted. As I will learn over the next 90 minutes, there’s little taken for granted at this meeting, and plenty of belief to be had.
The doors to the auditorium spring open, and the Worship Team—the same group of people praying in the hallway moments earlier—enters the room and assumes its position on stage. As the lights dim, it’s time to sit back and observe.
* * *
HCFA is, at least on the surface, similar to many religious organizations at Harvard: a dedicated group of students and ministry on an otherwise secular campus. What makes it unique is its connection to a pan-Ivy parent organization, Christian Union, a non-profit corporation dedicated to “developing Christian leaders to transform culture” and tailored to target the student bodies of competitive, hyper-academic institutions. At its core, HCFA strives to foster a “Christ-centered community” and promote an intellectual and meticulous study of scripture, bringing Ivy League rigor to the Bible—all under the gentle but strong guidance of Christian Union.
And beyond the divine, HCFA is dedicated to encouraging the sort of individual growth and introspection, be it spiritual or emotional, that many—from administrators to students to critics—say is far too scarce at Harvard. Everyone acknowledges that the College is a difficult and a challenging place to navigate; HCFA can offer students a helping hand for that journey, albeit one deeply tinged with Christian belief.

In the back of the triangular auditorium hangs a solitary string of Christmas lights providing a golden glow; at the triangle’s point is the stage. On it stands the Worship Team. The team is one of nearly a dozen student-run ministries within HCFA and says that its mission is to “lead people to encounter the love of Christ through songs.”
“Let’s stand together and worship,” cries out one of the leaders, inspiring the crowd to rise. The group begins with a prayer: They thank God for letting them gather together in Yenching, then broaden out to acknowledge the Lord’s various other sacrifices.
This group leads the first 20 or so minutes of Doxa. Folksy songs fill the space. A sextet leads the audience in musical worship. There is a violinist, a cellist, a guitarist, a keyboard player, a seated figure tapping a bongo drum, and one standing and singing; behind them, a projector screen displays the lyrics so the crowd can partake as well. Bathed in darkness, the whole scene has a distinctly summer camp-like vibe to it; it certainly feels more like we are gathered around a bonfire than just a few dozen feet from the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations.
“Were you there when they crucified my Lord? Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?”
The team leads a variation of “Were You There,” a nineteenth century hymn typically attributed to African-American slaves. The audience is quiet at first, but sings with increasing volume and passion as the song continues.
“Were you there when the stone was rolled away?”
Followers stand and sway, forming a chorus. One, clad in a flannel shirt, raises his arms toward the sky before resting them on the crown of his head. Another, in a blue t-shirt, places his hand over his heart, as if pledging allegiance.
As the musicians begin their next song, more audience members join in physical worship.
“Now, nothing is holding me back from you.”
The music swells and builds.
“What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus.”
A number of celebrants close their eyes and stretch out their hands to the stage, grasping, figuratively, at something more. The guitarist takes his hands off his instrument to echo the audience members. One lone attendant sits with his head in his hands, in between his knees.
“Now, by this I’ll reach my home. Nothing but the blood of Jesus.”
The Worship Team finishes and leaves the stage to enthusiastic applause. The darkness dissolves into light, and the crowd returns to sitting. The magic of summer camp is over. Now, the auditorium is  back to a jarringly bright classroom.

HCFA is far more than a gathering of Harvard students undulating and humming along with Christian hymns in the darkness. There’s something far more weighty than the drama of gospel music at hand. Formally, it’s a non-denominational Christ-centric organization of nearly 200 students—roughly 190, according to Don Weiss, its most senior staff member, and Kate J. Massinger ’16, one of the outgoing co-presidents—who participate in weekly Bible courses tailored to each grade and by gender. A subset of this 190-odd group attends Doxa each week; another handful of students who do not enroll in Bible courses also regularly sit in on Doxa. There is a definite evangelical bent to HCFA’s activities, a far cry from the ritualistic liturgical practices found in many high Protestant, Catholic, or Orthodox churches.
At the helm of HCFA are two co-presidents (one male and one female), a number of other student members of an Executive Board, and five full-time ministry staff members. This staff, led by Weiss, works out of an airy office near Harvard Yard on Mass. Ave. With sunlight streaming into the white-washed space, towering shelves of books line the walls and the air is distinctly sweet (the office sits atop the waffle shop Zinneken’s, a popular meeting spot for HCFA members and staff). These offices are where Bible courses typically meet, during which students explore set curricula that focus on certain themes—like sex and spirituality, for example—or specific books of the Bible.
 In addition to Doxa and Bible courses, many members are regularly mentored and advised by ministry staff on matters spiritual or merely personal. Massinger and her successor, Molly L. Richmond ’18, joke that the place on campus most representative of HCFA is actually the many coffee shops scattered throughout mid-Cambridge. Massinger and Richmond, personally, are big fans of Darwin’s and Petsi Pies—favorites of many Harvard students.
And, like many student groups at the College, HCFA fosters a formal and informal social network. From post-Doxa gatherings to women’s teas to daily prayers at 8:45 a.m. in one of the tower classrooms of Memorial Hall, it seems that the interpersonal aspect of HCFA is at least as important as the scriptural one. Nearly every member I spoke to mentioned having a roommate or blockmate who also participates in HCFA.
When I ask John S. Acton ’17 about how much time he spends on HCFA each week, he says he’s definitely on the “more involved end of the spectrum,” dedicating eight to 10 hours weekly to leading the Seeking God team (which is “dedicated to prayer”). He pauses and rethinks his answer. A cross pendant dangles from his neck. “Admittedly, it’s somewhat hard to figure out where the lines end between things I’m doing as part of HCFA and things I’m just doing with friends,” he says. 
David M. Fulton ’16, the other outgoing co-president, describes Massinger and two of the other Exec Board members (Daniel N.T. Yue ’16, a former Crimson design chair, and Elizabeth E. Sult Case ’17) as “some of the closest friends I’ve ever had,” then expanding that group to include a former leader of one of his Bible courses and a previous HCFA president. “I’m lucky I have so many people I can stuff into that category,” he says.
Nick Nowalk, an HCFA ministry fellow who has been at the College since the group’s inception on campus in 2008, mentions these “relational connections” several times while explaining HCFA’s appeal. Both Massinger and Fulton note that one of the most challenging aspects of running the group was constantly devoting time and emotion to the relationships they had with other members and leaders. Scott Ely ’18 says he made a quick and instant connection with HCFA members and staff as a freshman. He felt a further tie to the group because his freshman year roommate also participated in it; at one point, he chuckles that HCFA is actually is how he met many of his current blockmates.
But as happens with all student groups, some people do trickle away from HCFA.
“Even if somebody came to a Bible course or Doxa for a season, to the degree that someone doesn’t feel relationally connected in friendships in HCFA, it’s much more likely that they’ll fade out,” Nowalk says. “Wholly apart from that, on a strictly ideological level, at a certain point, if a student becomes more persuaded that, ‘Yeah, I don’t buy this, I just don’t believe it,’ it’s more likely that at some point their interest will fade.”
And, in a growing group with a membership nearing 200, student leaders must constantly consider if these relational connections still feel intimate. Fulton describes one of the challenges he faced as co-president as “maintaining the initial passion and closeness that characterized your community,” as the group’s successful evangelizing caused it to expand and evolve during his year-long tenure.
* * *
This week’s keynote speaker at Doxa is Nowalk, who says he will address “what it means to be a Christian” by exploring a perceived internal struggle many Christians feel—“in between the Kingdom of God and the power of darkness in our lives”—that is, in his opinion, ultimately a false dichotomy. He wears a blue t-shirt and jeans, with a mop of curly brown hair. Nowalk is candid, warm, a far cry from stuffy ministers in starched clerical collars and sweeping cassocks.
“Why is it that every day you wake up, you find in one sense or another two sets of desires—desires that are honoring the God, desires that are profoundly dishonoring the God?” he asks.
Nowalk explains that present in the New Testament is an “already but not yet core existence to our identity as Christians.” No more than three minutes into his speech, he explains that he’s been fighting an awful flu for the past few days, and so he may need to stop and take a breather at some point.  “I’m not sure if I’m going to make it through this,” he says.
He pauses and asks the crowd to pray to God with him. 
* * *
Days later, perched over a small table at the Starbucks in the Garage, Nowalk and I discuss why he so enjoys working for HCFA. Beyond Harvard’s intellectual environment and Nowalk’s connections with students here,  there’s a very practical reason why HCFA is an ideal employer. While many campus fellowship positions require their ministry staff to fundraise all or part of their salaries, HCFA receives comprehensive financial support from Christian Union. Nowalk explains that as a ministry fellow, he is a full-time paid employee. This is a major advantage that HCFA carries over similar peer groups, freeing up its fellows’ time to actually spread the gospel.
“I actually wasn’t looking to do campus or college ministry at the time,” Nowalk says of his post-seminary job search. “Mostly because in most campus ministries, somebody like me has to raise their support full time to do this, and doing that when you’ve got a lot of debt from grad school, a family, you want to do it long-term, you want to do it in the Northeast, in a city where it’s expensive—that’s not very doable.”
Christian Union was founded by Matt Bennett, a graduate of Cornell, in 2002. Bennett had worked for the Princeton chapter of Campus Crusades for Christ (Cru) before realizing the potential in the greater campus fellowship landscape for an organization specifically tailored to Ivy League institutions. As Weiss and Hutz Hertzberg, the organization’s current president, explain, these schools have distinct student bodies—future leaders of America, if you will—and rigorous academic programs that necessitate a different method. CU, then, advocates for an intense and intellectual study of scripture as well as a “strategic approach” to “developing Christian leaders.” In plain English, this means that CU beefs up Bible study to Ivy standards and operates with the optimistic viewpoint that student members will, in the future, be Gospel-educated world leaders.
“Being at Harvard is pretty different than being at Ohio State or Northern Illinois University in terms of the student makeup and the ethos on campus,” says Hertzberg, who has served as an academic administrator at the university level and as a chaplain in the United States Naval Reserve. “That was really the impetus behind it.”
And so for nearly 15 years, Bennett, the organization’s CEO, and Hertzberg have led a staff of several dozen in creating a range of Bible courses and cultivating a network of future leaders guided by evangelical Christian faith. What began small—a singular outlet at Princeton—has spread to the entire Ivy League, with some branches containing several hundred members. At seven of the eight schools, chapters have gained official student group recognition—Dartmouth is the lone holdout. Each chapter holds weekly Bible courses and evening worship services (such as HCFA’s Doxa). Weekly teleconferences among ministry staff and CU headquarters ensure that operations are running smoothly all over the country. A hefty sum of donations—Christian Union reported total contributions over $7.7 million in its 2014 financial statement—keep its staff happily employed and its programming robust.
CU’s connection to HCFA is more than a strictly financial one. As Weiss, Nowalk, and all the student leaders I interviewed note, Christian Union provides organizational guidance and help to HCFA. This materializes in the form of providing the five full-time ministry staff, the office space on Mass. Ave, curriculum and materials for Bible courses, and, to a certain extent, the greater ideologies guiding the group’s activities. CU also plans biennial Nexus conferences for networking amongst the memberships of each school.
Still, HCFA members emphasize that the group is very much student-driven and emotionally independent from Christian Union. Hertzberg says that CU chapters “really are student-run organizations” with autonomy of expression. “We look at ourselves as being resourcing agents to these various campuses,” he says.
Fulton terms his interactions with CU—“the great mothership in the sky”—as only “fairly limited” during his presidency, something he doesn’t see as a negative. Massinger and Richmond agree that contact with Christian Union, beyond the ministry staff they employ, is pretty minimal for students. According to Fulton, Christian Union typically “defers to its ministry fellows on the ground,” understanding that the power of the organization is built around an “actual human being having a conversation.”
With regard to the emphasis CU puts on Christ-driven leadership, Fulton says this concept is implicitly part of HCFA given that it is a Harvard College fellowship. Anyway, Fulton says, he would feel “woefully unprepared” to teach many of his peers, already adept leaders, how to lead.
 It seems that leadership, a concept so prominently featured in Christian Union’s marketing materials, does take a bit of back seat to one’s personal spiritual journey at HCFA. It is, however, never ignored. Hertzberg explains that a lot of the leadership development goes hand-in-hand with the personal meetings students have with ministry staff. It’s further emphasized by the large number of leadership positions that exist for  students within each campus branch.

Back in Yenching Auditorium, Nowalk finishes praying for his health. “My heart is beating really fast right now,” he admits. Returning to his homily, he embarks upon a close reading of scripture, focusing heavily on Romans, a book that several Bible courses are studying this semester.
For nearly an hour, Nowalk speaks—his enthusiasm, verbosity, and charisma mask any illness—and tries to impress upon the crowd that the sense among many Christians that they’re inherently “sinful and yet righteous,” unable to avoid wickedness, is somewhat false. Instead, he proposes, “the pursuit of holiness in the Christian life is all about habits and routines and strategies of intentions.” To paraphrase, Nowalk argues that you are more than your sin, which should be seen as an abnormality rather than the default state, avoided by deliberate thought and action.
“Christian obedience is about what you do with your body much more than it is about what you think or what you feel,” Nowalk asserts. “I think so many of us over-spiritualize the fight against sin.” Nowalk is fond of repetition and speaks at a lilting tempo.
“Momentum builds in the Christian life. Momentum builds.”

So, who are the hundreds of current and former HCFA members, and why do they choose HCFA over Harvard’s other non-denominational Christian organizations like Campus Crusades for Christ or InterVarsity? What is it about HCFA, besides the close-knit community it creates amongst members, that makes it so special?
For one, HCFA creates a dedicated body in which Christians can explore and further understand their faith. This fall, a plurality of freshmen—nearly 40 percent of the class of 2019—reported identifying as atheist or agnostic. It is, as some students and ministry staff say, quite unusual to be an actively believing and worshipping Christian on an Ivy League campus. Ministry staff and HCFA members are certainly not in denial about this reality; while many students in HCFA came to Harvard knowing they’d participate in campus fellowship, Richmond and Massinger estimate that roughly half did not.
“There’s a place to belong even without believing,” Nowalk says of HCFA. While belief in Christ and the Christian life is the goal of the organization, “there is a place for students who don’t have faith, even if they don’t ever end up being convinced.”
A subset of students did not even regard themselves as Christian before coming to Harvard, and some members of HCFA still do not. Nowalk and Weiss, for example, became Christians in college after identifying as non-religious growing up. It’s an experience, they say, that makes them particularly equipped to guide similarly-minded students on this journey.
“I think it’s challenging for students that are processing, searching, and then landing in Christianity,” Weiss explains of the secular college experience. “I think there are stereotypes. There are hurdles. To identify as a Christian at a place like Harvard can be somewhat costly. Not in any kind of overt type of persecution, but I think a lot of people question whether Christianity is intellectually viable.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana acknowledges that “there’s always a general concern in a research university or the ethos of a secular modern institution that somehow identifying or expressing religious beliefs might be associated with somehow not a pro-scientific perspective.” Recognizing that some students and faculty experience this phenomenon, Khurana says he think that those are ultimately “false dichotomies,” and that religion and research can certainly be reconciled.
Students in HCFA generally echo Weiss in acknowledging that it can be difficult to be a Christian—and a devoted one at that—at Harvard, although they all emphasize that friends and acquaintances of all faiths (or lack thereof) are supportive of their beliefs.
Acton, who was initially anxious about Harvard’s secular nature, has not found significant barriers to his faith. “You’re not going to gain any social capital from saying you have religious beliefs,” he says. “If anything, people will be more likely to downplay them slightly, although there isn’t substantial pressure to downplay them.”
A junior studying economics, Acton emphasizes that there is both some “social stigma” as well as “opportunity cost” associated with religious groups, meaning that for that anyone committed to a group like HCFA, “they’re probably taking it seriously.” 
And so HCFA works to bridge whatever gap may arise at Harvard between the spiritual life and the academic one by providing a rigorous study of the Bible and exposure to important Christian philosophers and thinkers.
Weiss, for one, welcomes complex questions about Christianity and treats them as opportunities and avenues for discussion. “You can’t fake it,” he says, in a soft-spoken timbre. “You have to be well read. You have to be conversant on all issues. You have to invite all questions and inquiries because how can you not?”
Massinger agrees. “It’s good to have to defend what we believe and talk about it with people,” she says. “I wouldn’t go to a Christian-only school if I had the choice.”
By actively and thoroughly studying the Bible, HCFA members and faculty (a term Hertzberg emphasizes that CU feels strongly about using with regard to its ministry staff) reach greater levels of spiritual self-fulfillment and enriched relationships with peers.
Ely, a sophomore who also sings in the Christian a capella group Under Construction, says one of the biggest benefits of HCFA is the guidance the full-time ministry staff provides through trying times that are pretty universal at the College. “[HCFA is] a community there for people to rely on each other throughout the many struggles we go through on Harvard’s campus,” he says. “It provides a grounding foundation for people of the Christian faith and people who are interested in learning more.”
As one of the new co-presidents of HCFA, Richmond has found that her role “allows you to know people in a different way and engage in a different way,” given the weighty and deeply personal place that faith inhabits in people’s lives. Massinger says that much of the enjoyment she derives from HCFA comes from connecting with others over shared beliefs; relationships in HCFA are not based off of what you’re good at or what social circle you’re in, but something far more internal. 
It seems that HCFA provides just the sort of emotional and personal guidance that many bemoan is not present enough at Harvard—though granted, that guidance does descend from the gospel. This religiosity does lead to certain lifestyle tenets—leaders of the group agree to a “standards contract” that Acton describes as having broad recommendations for Christian behavior such as “commitment to spiritual growth” and more tangible expectations for things like abstinence and avoiding excessive drunkenness.
While many students at Harvard would shy away from these sorts of suggestions—it is important to note that casual attendees of Bible courses and Doxa are not asked to submit to them—those same people might, in fact, find the community and spirituality that HCFA fosters rather comforting.
* * *
Every meeting of Doxa finishes with logistical announcements in the form of “Doxa Talk,” a semi-comedic video that HCFA started producing a few years ago, according to Fulton, in order to hasten along this segment of the night. Episodes of “Doxa Talk,” along with each week’s keynote address and a number of other clips (I found “How Not to Invite
Someone to Doxa” particularly funny) can be found on HCFA’s YouTube channel.
This week’s video skit opens with a trio of HCFA members discussing the upcoming Easter Egg hunt at Aletheia, a non-denominational evangelical church based out of the Central Square YMCA that a plurality of HCFA members attend. It’s rumored that not only will the Easter Bunny make an appearance, but so will Jesus Christ himself. “Wait, is it Jesus before the resurrection or after the resurrection?” one of the students in the video asks. They muse on the aesthetics, power, and musculature of Jesus. “He was pretty divinely swole,” another says. “Like, Trinitarian triceps.”
The next bit—“Valley Girl Time”—features Tyler S. Parker ’17 and Tori A. Elliott ’16 assuming silly accents to publicize the imminent Nexus conference, which will be held in New Haven at the Omni Hotel—“easily the hottest hotel in the greater Yale area,” as Parker terms it. There will be opportunities for networking, seminars, vocational panels, speakers, and hundreds of fellow Christian Union students from across the Ivy League. “I’m gonna be at the movie star panel,” Parker jokes. “So, like, check me out.”
Doxa Talk ends with advice from the Campus Kindness team (its mission? “To spread God’s love across campus through quasi-random acts of kindness.”) in the form of a “Tip of the Week” to “rekindle old flames [and] reconnect with old friendships.” Elliott muses about promising to “grab a meal sometime” with a distant friend. “Bless up,” she says. It’s the most sincere DJ Khaled reference I’ve ever heard.
* * *
In the grand scheme of things, it’s not particularly shocking that Doxa Talk ended with a secular “Tip of the Week.” Despite being a self-proclaimed “gospel-centric community,” HCFA has recently made significant efforts to reach out to individuals who might not necessarily feel the call of Christ already. Despite its dedication to scripture and worship, the group has worked alongside secular student organizations. Richmond also describes doing service work in an interfaith context, specifically with Islamic student groups and Hillel. “We see a lot of value in collaboration,” she says.
One recent example is the group’s “You Are More” campaign, which sought to emphasize to students their significance as people, rather than the weight of accomplishments, activities, relationships, or academics. The drive saw HCFA host themed study breaks and editions of Doxa to explore this concept.
As part of “You Are More,” HCFA teamed up with the Student Mental Health Liaisons to host an open mic event—aimed at examining the role of stigma in instances of personal failure—at Cabot Cafe on March 2. Several dozen students, perhaps further lured by the promise of free drinks from the Cafe, showed up to support friends and listen to peers open up about moments and experiences of imperfections.
A tall junior, Diana Sheedy ’17, described feeling disappointed in herself after a mistake on an internship project; with big sparkling eyes, she finished by reminding the crowd that we are all inherently valuable as people—“everyone will love you for who you are.”  
Acton spoke about his participation in Bible competitions when he was younger. He first joined in middle school, entranced by a community in which he felt totally comfortable and an activity at which he excelled. He continued to participate in high school. While his team’s attempts at a national championship fell short, he overcame these regrets by cherishing the community, friendship, and spiritual satisfaction he found in the group. In losing, Acton concluded, he in fact gained true perspective about his identity and what was actually important.
The various speakers talked about a range of topics—from student council elections to orchestras to lapsed friendships. Some reflected on their faith—Acton being one such example—but others did not touch on religion at all. While HCFA may have sponsored the event, the takeaway was spiritual beyond the bounds of Christianity: We are all greater than our failures, and we all have the capacity to connect to others.
Massinger, who spearheaded “You Are More” with Fulton this past year, says that HCFA leaders had been looking for “accessible ways for people to engage in our community.”
“We thought that this message of being more than one’s work or extracurriculars or relationship status would be really applicable to Harvard students,” Massinger says. “In the Christian story, that means that you are fundamentally reconciled with Christ and your value comes from being created by God, so that’s of course what we were saying. We were never trying to hide that, but just the general idea that you are more than the things you have on your calendar everyday we thought at its core was something people would be interested in.”
There is, implicit in some of HCFA’s work with secular groups, a certain degree of outreach to non-religious students. Because the group isn’t an official chaplaincy, its ministry staff is not bound by certain restrictions related to proselytizing religion. Campaigns like “You Are More” distill aspects of Christianity—such as self-respect—into digestible bites even an atheist would feel comfortable with. Regardless, members and leaders of HCFA emphasize that they never seek to lure students under a false pretense that they would be joining anything but a Christian community.
“In all our pitching and recruiting efforts, we’re pretty honest about who we are,” Massinger says. “It’s very upfront. People at Harvard aren’t going to stick around as soon as they find out it’s a religious organization, anyway, if they didn’t want to participate in that or think about it in the first place.”
Whatever ambitions HCFA may have for its future and growth, Christian Union is open and clear about its own aspirations. The organization’s next three-year strategic plan is in the pipeline—Hertzberg jests that we can talk about it in “six months”—but plenty of projects are already on tap. CU will soon expand its campus ministry outside the Ivy League for the first time ever, arriving at Stanford this fall. There is interest in branching out to even more non-Ivy peer institutions, such as MIT, Northwestern, and the University of Chicago, which yield similar cohorts of alumni. Hertzberg says he hopes that CU, which does have an on-the-ground staff in New York City focused on alumni support, can continue to grow its post-graduate offerings, with richer faith-based programming, career networking, and advising in even more cities like Washington, D.C. and Chicago.
“We can see ourselves growing,” he says, optimistically.

Every Doxa meeting ends with a standard anthem that leaders and celebrants sing together.  The crowd breaks slowly. Members chatter with one another again, and then disperse for their respective Friday evening activities. Some shuffle off to parties, others to nights of catching up on homework and sleep. A sizeable portion peel off for an HCFA-endorsed post-Doxa social in the basement of Quincy. There will be fried chicken. Attendees are encouraged to BYOB, which in this case stands for “Bring Your Own Board-game.”
It’s now dark outside, and the rain has let up. Easter is nigh and spirits are, perhaps, refreshed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a stirring ceremony Wednesday, University President Drew G. Faust, joined by Congressman John R. Lewis, remembered Harvard’s forgotten past and dedicated a plaque to four enslaved persons who lived and worked on campus in the 18th century.
Faust and Lewis spoke about the importance of confronting Harvard’s complicity in slavery, drawing a crowd of high-profile Harvard administrators, professors, alumni, and reporters. After a performance from the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, the group then moved outside to Wadsworth House, where Faust and Lewis unsheathed the plaque bearing the names of Bilhah, Venus, Titus, and Juba— four slaves Harvard presidents had owned.
Faust, a historian of the Antebellum South, announced her plans for the memorial in a rare Crimson op-ed last week. In addition to the Wadsworth House plaque, Faust said she has also convened a committee led by history professors Sven Beckert and Evelyn B. Higginbotham to study other campus sites connected with slavery and consider future memorials.
“Harvard is very involved with its past, but this part of it has been marginalized, hidden, made not visible,” Faust said in an interview with The Crimson after the unveiling. “We want to have a full understanding of Harvard’s history, because that, I believe, will enable us to come together around what has been and transcend that and move to what we want to have happen in the future.”
Lewis, a prominent civil rights activist from Georgia, delivered a heartfelt address praising Faust for making such a visible effort to engage the history of slavery at Harvard.
“For 400 years, the voices of generations have been calling us to remember. We have been tossing and turning for centuries in a restless sleep. We have pleaded with them to be still, but they will not be silent,” Lewis said. “We are people suffering from amnesia. We are haunted by a past that is shut up in our bones. But we have just learned the truth of what it is.”
In his speech, Lewis—who was elected in 1986—reflected on the forgotten slave labor that went into building the nation’s capital. After the ceremony, Lewis told The Crimson he believes that other institutions in the government and private sector should follow Harvard’s example in reckoning with their own histories.
“This is very meaningful not just for this campus and the Harvard University community, but to the nation,” Lewis said. “I think this may help other faces all over America to realize the distance we’ve come and the progress we’ve made that we must never ever forget our past. We learn from the past. We learn from history. We can build on it.”
Beckert, who in 2007 taught a seminar on Harvard’s ties to slavery, unearthed the four names now gracing the plaque during several years of research with undergraduate students. The class eventually published a booklet recording their findings, which event staffers handed out to attendees at Dudley House.
“We know the names of individual people, and when the oppressions of slavery are translated into individual lives, I think they’re much more tangible. They’re much more available to us in the present to understand,” Faust said to The Crimson. “These are people like you or me, and slavery was not just a system, it was millions of human lives.”
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body— introduced Faust and Lewis.
“It is easy to highlight and to celebrate the things that have occurred in the past that instill us with pride. It is harder to shine a light on those aspects of our past that deeply disturb us, that confuse us, that confound us, and that we might prefer to leave in the shadows,” he said.
The installment of the plaque comes during a year when Harvard’s historical connections to slavery and racism have become a topic of scrutiny and discussion among many administrators. Earlier this semester, Faculty Deans replaced their old title because of concerns about the racial implications of the term “House master.” Just last month, the Harvard Corporation approved a Law School committee’s recommendation to change the school’s seal, which sparked controversy this year because of its ties to a formerly slaveholding family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: April 7, 2016, at 12:34 p.m.
While many Harvard students feel the need to escape the pressures of academic life, they can now try their hand at escaping a room full of puzzles in the basement of Eliot House.
Last weekend, Eliot opened its own Escape the Room, an interactive installation in which groups of four to six people are “trapped” in a room and must race to solve puzzles inside to “escape.” The game has gained popularity in recent years and now can be found in sites across the globe.
The organizers, a group of four Eliot blockmates, said they hoped to bring the fun to Harvard’s campus while keeping costs down.
Peter L. Ku ’16, one of the co-builders, explained that after a few House outings to Escape the Room in Boston, he and his blockmates thought students here would enjoy the experience if it were not cost-prohibitive.
“We wanted to get more people to get excited about Escape the Room but it costs $28 per person. You have to take a trip into Boston and pay for Ubers; it’s kind of expensive and time consuming,” Ku said. “We thought to ourselves, ‘Hey, this doesn’t seem so hard to create, and it could be kind of fun, and I bet we could do it ourselves. So we did.”
Once they got the House administration on board with the idea, Ku and his blockmates— Amanda Lin ’16, Velina Kozareva ’16, and Suman Gunasekaran ’16—spent their spring break planning, designing, and building the room.
“We spent a lot of time in the woodshop, building our own puzzles, using scrap wood that was free for everyone,” Lin said.
They also received donations, including a webcam from the House, and were ultimately able to keep construction costs under $100. Groups of four to six can sign up on the game’s Facebook page.
The organizers first tested the room with their friends, then opened it up to members of the House, before opening it to all Harvard affiliates.
Bailey Q. Colfax ’19, who was one of the original testers, said she liked that the installation required more intense thinking than movement, as opposed to other experiences she has had with the game.
“Some other Escape the Rooms have been very physical,” she said. “I don’t think those challenged my mind quite as much as the puzzles that we had here.”
Michael S. Giles ’19, another student who participated as a tester,  said he would recommend the exhibition to friends.
“It was a good way to work with my friends,” he said. “There was a big teamwork component to it, so I’d encourage other blocking groups or friend groups to try it.”
Ku said the next step was to get more people trained to run the room in order to make more time slots available, even after the organizers graduate.
“Hopefully it catches on enough so that people want to do it into future years, and build another Escape the Room, either in Eliot or in a different House, then run their game,” Ku said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It remains unclear whether Boston University will follow through with funding a third of West Station in Allston alongside Harvard and the state government.
Announced in September 2014, West Station, a new commuter rail station to be built on Harvard-owned land, will connect Allston to an existing commuter rail line. Harvard and the state government each agreed at the time and remain committed to cover one third of the cost of the $25 million project, but the Massachusetts Department of Transportation was unable to secure a third party to provide the rest of the funding.
In a September 2014 letter to then-Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 obtained by the Boston Globe, BU President Robert A. Brown wrote that the university was “prepared to help fund the construction of West Station” pending further discussion and an agreement that would prevent cars and buses from using BU’s West Campus to reach the station. No agreement was ever finalized between BU and the state.
“It was very brazen of BU to write the letter that they wrote,” said Allston resident Richard Parr ’01. “I don’t think the state should agree to the conditions that BU wanted to put on their money.” He added that West Station is “really important” to the neighborhood and the region, and said BU “shouldn’t get a veto on something this important.”
In March 2015, after the Globe published an article on the BU president’s letter, BU spokesperson Colin D. Riley told The Crimson that BU and the state needed to further discuss the impact West Station might have on surrounding neighborhoods before making any official agreement. Since then, little progress has been made.
“We have not been involved in any recent conversations regarding funding West Station, and we don’t expect any to take place in the near future,” Riley wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday. “Right now, our focus is on the public task force process convened by MassDOT.… It is premature to discuss the design, cost, and funding of West Station.”
MassDOT assembled the Allston Interstate 90 Interchange Task Force, comprising Harvard and BU affiliates, city officials, and Allstonians, in April 2014. The task force is charged with advising the state on West Station and the $260 million Mass. Turnpike realignment project, which proposes to straighten I-90 over the Harvard-owned Beacon Park Railyard. Construction on both projects is slated to begin in 2017.
Though the Turnpike task force is intended, in part, to give local residents a voice in the planning process, Parr expressed frustration with what he said was a lack of transparency.
“We do have a task force that includes Allston residents, [but] the problem with it is that we’re all well aware that… if Harvard wants to have a conversation with MassDOT, it can go have a private conversation with MassDOT,” Parr said. “[When] we come to these public meetings where everyone gathers, they say very little about their plans.”
Parr also said Harvard should consider funding “the entire thing itself,” in conjunction with the state, if BU ultimately backs out of its promise to help pay for West Station.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comment on Parr’s suggestion.
“Harvard has long supported the inclusion of West Station in the project and has committed to participate in the funding,” Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, wrote in an emailed statement, describing the ongoing task force discussions as “very constructive.”

UPDATED: April 7, 2016, at 12:30 p.m.
From now until 2023, Allston residents will have a difficult decision to make: how to best spend $5.35 million of Harvard’s money.
Some want to spend it on the refurbishment of a rundown amphitheatre, others on the renovation of a nearby library, and still others on the installation of neighborhood security cameras. As they decide, Allstonians will deal with the activity, traffic, and noise endemic to construction sites as Harvard proceeds with its Allston developments, many of which are already underway.
In a first for its community relations, Harvard allocated the $5.35 million, termed a “flexible fund,” for unspecified public improvements in the Allston neighborhood as part of a $43 million community benefits package detailed in its institutional master plan for the neighborhood. Boston College’s $2.5 million “Neighborhood Improvement Fund,” created around the same time, served as inspiration for Harvard.
While BC, with only a few months head start, has already finished its first round of grants, Harvard’s allocation process has only just begun. In late February, the Flexible Fund Executive Committee—comprising Allston residents and Boston officials—heard the very first proposals for how to best distribute the $5.35 million.
Looking to its more efficient counterpart at BC, the flexible fund committee faces a neighborhood-wide lack of knowledge as the first deadline for grant applications approaches.
DECIDING NOT TO DECIDE
The concept of a flexible fund emerged from discussions between Harvard representatives, Boston officials, and Allstonians in the fall of 2013, in what Boston Redevelopment Authority senior project manager Gerald Autler termed the “home stretch” leading to the BRA’s approval of Harvard’s master plan and associated community benefits package. The BRA is Boston’s urban planning agency.
According to Autler, Harvard representatives initially proposed a number of concrete projects to improve the Allston neighborhood, but local residents were unenthusiastic. Many felt that the items Harvard put forward were not “the most important public realm improvements,” Autler said.
Harvard sidestepped the disagreements by making the decision to “not make the decision,” he added, describing the flexible fund.
“The idea of the physical flexible fund was to provide some level of funding that community could help direct to projects that are important to them,” Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said of the grant money.
At first, Harvard planned to allot only $2 million to the flexible fund, but the figure rose to $5.35 million after further negotiation with Allstonians and city officials. Autler cited “the quality of the programs that we wanted to provide” as the reason for the increase. After the signing of the cooperation agreement, he added, the number is now set in stone and cannot be changed.
The BRA officially approved Harvard’s Allston plans in October 2013. A little more than a year later, the University signed a cooperation agreement with the City of Boston outlining Harvard’s specific community benefits obligations, including the flexible fund.
NOT FROM SCRATCH
The notion of a flexible fund—a lump sum of money not dedicated in advance to specific projects—is unprecedented in the history of Harvard’s community relations. Previous agreements included clear commitments, Autler said. Harvard, however, cannot take full credit for the concept.
The structure of Harvard’s flexible fund draws heavily from that of BC’s $2.5 million  Neighborhood Improvement Fund for the Allston-Brighton area, finalized in August 2014 as part of BC’s community benefits package for its own 10-year master plan.
“We didn’t necessarily create it from scratch, we utilized the BC model,” Jim Montgomery, a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force who also sits on the executive committee, said of the flexible fund. “They have some documents that we are utilizing… as a guideline to go from,” he added.
The Harvard and BC funds are similar in many ways. Both are specifically intended for improvements in public property, and both allocate grant money based on publicly available applications. Harvard, however, has an independent committee dedicated to managing its flexible fund, while BC assigned the responsibility for the Neighborhood Improvement Fund to its already existing BC Allston-Brighton task force—a body equivalent to Harvard’s task force.
“We didn’t think it was necessary to add another layer to it,” Jeanne Levesque, the director of governmental relations at BC, said. “[The task force members] are busy people, they have jobs, they have enough to do to get to these meetings.”
Levesque also cited “time-efficiency” as an argument against creating a separate, neighborhood improvement fund-specific committee. The BC task force, composed entirely of volunteers, meets once a month from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.
Casey described the decision to create the flexible fund committee as a judgment “that the task force made itself” and not a Harvard choice. He added that Harvard task force members already have a prohibitively “heavy burden” in terms of meetings they have to attend.
“They can’t manage every program individually,” he said.
The Harvard task force meets roughly every two months at unfixed times, considerably less often than its BC counterpart. In 2014 and 2015 combined, the task force met a total of 10 times.
Though BC’s NIF received final approval just three months before Harvard’s flexible fund, BC has already completed the first round of grant applications and is now embarking on its second. Of the eight proposals submitted, BC—in conjunction with the BC task force and the BRA—approved six.
Harvard officially began the first cycle of grant applications on March 1, when the BRA posted an online application form for the flexible fund. Final applications are due in to Autler’s office or the Harvard Ed Portal on Western Avenue by May 2.
THE SAME GOAL
Despite the flexible fund’s potential to improve their neighborhood, few locals say they are aware of the fund or the first impending grant cycle.
“I don’t know that a lot of people know about it, quite honestly,” longtime Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alford said. “I think the people… that are aware of the meetings and attend the meetings [know about it].”
John A. Bruno, the interim chair of the Harvard-Allston task force, agreed. He said he believed the BRA and Harvard have so far made the fund allocation process “transparent,” ensuring that residents of Allston and Brighton have the opportunity to understand “what flexible spending money is.”
He added, however, that not many will likely take advantage of this opportunity.
“Whether or not the community is dependent on a few to spread the message of what’s going on, I don’t know, that’s usually the case,” he said. “I’m fine with that, that’s why we have a task force, that’s why we have a flexible spending committee.”
In an attempt to increase the neighborhood’s awareness of the flexible fund, the BRA recently hosted a public information session for the flexible fund at a community center in Brighton. At the meeting, Autler outlined the application process in detail before answering attendees’ questions.
Roughly 15 people went to the information session, according to Allston resident Ed A. Kotomori, most of them hailing from Allston or Brighton. Though Autler described the overall attendance as “sparse,” Kotomori said he thought “there was a lot of people from the community” there.
“There was actually more people there from different organizations, so apparently the communication has gotten out there,” Kotomori said. “Just judging from the questions they asked, I think they thought [the flexible fund] was a positive thing.”
Flexible fund committee member Jim Montgomery said the money could serve as a unifying force between Harvard affiliates, BRA officials, and locals.
“At the end of the day, we all have the same goal and that is to improve Allston,” he said. “The flex fund is a part of that larger picture, of what we can all do to improve the neighborhood.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clashing over issues ranging from the meaning of true democracy to the role of the Graduate Student Council, graduate students voted to pass a hotly contested resolution to condemn Harvard’s filing of a joint amicus brief against graduate student unionization at this month’s GSC meeting. 
The resolution, which passed 34 to 6, states that Harvard's filing of the brief “interferes with the democratic rights of graduate student workers.” At a meeting in November, the Graduate Student Council passed a resolution to support graduate student workers and union organizers, but not to support the movement itself.
GSC Vice President John Gee, a supporter of the unionization effort, proposed the resolution debated at this month’s meeting.
“This is just us telling Harvard that we meant what we said in the fall,” Gee said.
In the lengthy debate before the vote, a few students discussed why they opposed the resolution. Jae Hyeon Lee, a graduate student who opposes the unionization effort, said the resolution is “inconsistent with the requirements of democracy.”
“Filing the brief is one way that University leaders have chosen to engage in the conversation, and to condemn it is to suppress the University’s voice,” Lee said.
Graduate student William Baldwin countered that Harvard's actions were undemocratic.
“It’s not democratic when someone says, ‘don’t worry, we’ve got this. We know what’s best for you.’ That’s what your dad says,” Baldwin said. “In a democracy, we trust people to make decisions that are right for themselves.”
Students at the meeting also voted for a new executive board. Answering a question posed to candidates for the vice president position, graduate student Peter J. Dyrud said he felt the GSC and the union effort should be independent of each other.
“I really believe that, especially for people in positions of authority on the GSC, our job is to remain overall independent of the union movement and other student initiatives because it’s really important to represent students on both sides,” Dyrud said.
Gee said the resolution would not merge the council and the union effort. Instead, he argued, it would only serve to “signal” to the administration that its actions were unacceptable.
“This doesn’t commit us to going out and signing students up for the union. It doesn’t commit us to going out and staging a sit-in at Mass. Hall or anything,” Gee said.
Two students raised concerns over whether it is appropriate for the GSC to take what they considered a “political” stance.
“We are here to support students. We are not here to be activists,” graduate student Kevin Tian said. “It is a very careful line to tread, and once we cross it, it will set a precedent that will carry on, that I do not think the full consequences are quite fully understood.”
When graduate student Jack M. Nicoludis, a spokesperson for the unionization effort, answered questions as a candidate for a GSC representative position, he was asked whether his membership in both organizations would be a “conflict of interest.” Nicoludis assured the questioner that he could personally support the union effort and keep that separate from his role as a representative.
Union supporters, on the other hand,  said that as a representative body, the GSC should fight for the rights of students to decide whether or not they want a union.
“It’s not a partisan issue; it’s an advocacy issue,” unionization supporter Abigail Weil said. But she added, “I don’t see anything wrong with the GSC taking a more active role and being political.”
At a time when a majority of graduate students employed by Harvard support unionization, graduate student opposition to the union has not been widely expressed. But Lee, who penned an editorial in The Crimson urging students to vote against the resolution, said that several students came up to him after the meeting and thanked him for expressing his opinion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the country tuned in to the men’s basketball national championship game on Monday night, another tournament—the oldest intercollegiate academic competition in the United States—was wrapping up at same time.
In the 70th National Debate Tournament championship, Harvard Debate Council members David J. Herman ’16 and Hemanth Sanjeev ’18 defeated a team from the University of Kansas to bring home the trophy for the first time in 26 years.
“It’s obviously pretty cool,” Herman said. “We got a bunch of emails and messages from alumni of the team of the team from 10, 20, 30 years ago who were pretty excited that we had finally broken the streak.”
Though Harvard usually attends the tournament and partook in the final four for the last three years, Harvard hadn't won the national championship since 1990.
“It’s history,” assistant debating coach Sherry A. Hall said. Hall had only coached for two years when Harvard last won the national championship nearly 30 years ago.
“It kind of came so early in my career that I don’t know that I fully appreciated the win,” she said. “We had a bunch of second place ones, and this was our third year in a row being in the final four, so it’s not like we haven’t had any success, but we weren’t quite ever able to get back there.”
The win is coach Dallas G. Perkins’s third in his coaching career at Harvard. He echoed Hall’s sentiments in a press release.
“A lot goes into winning the [tournament]: long and careful preparation, countless hours of practice, and a bit of luck,” he wrote. “We have had some extremely talented teams over the past quarter-century, but none better than Hemanth and David.”
The pair’s run through the single-elimination tournament started with the team’s reception for the Copeland Award, which they were awarded for being ranked first in the entering 78-team field. After three days of preliminary competition, Harvard was then seeded seventh in the single-elimination bracket.
Their run through the tournament included wins over a Michigan State University team, the United States Military Academy in the round of 16, Georgetown University in the elite eight, the top Michigan State University team in the final four, and finally the University of Kansas in the championship round.
Herman attributed the win to both hard work and luck.
“Part of it is not just how hard you work—there’s also some measure of luck given the way the tournament is structured kind of like March Madness, where you have very high probability of random stuff going wrong,” Herman said. “It’s obviously very cool to win, and to meet the expectations of everyone who came before us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shrouded by candlelight on the steps of Memorial Church, students spoke out against sexual assault and shared personal stories Wednesday night as administrators and other spectators looked on. 
Titled “Hear Me Now,” the event featured musical and spoken word performances along with personal testimony, and was meant to provide a space for the roughly 50 attendees to reflect on the effects of sexual assault and offer mutual support.
The event took place as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, a nationwide effort to bring attention to sexual violence. Attendees slowly walked from Dudley House to Tercentenary Theater, ending at Memorial Church and pausing intermittently for nearly a dozen student performances throughout the procession.
According to organizers Mia A. Charifson ’18 and Ege Yumusak ’16, Hear Me Now sought to offer solidarity and support for anyone affected by sexual violence.
“This was a chance to listen and connect to others regardless of what you have or have not experienced, and regardless of what you are willing to share or have already shared to others,” she said.
Events of this nature happen often at other  universities and colleges, and  an international organization called “Take Back the Night” encourages colleges to host candlelit vigils and speak-out events with the end goal of preventing sexual assault.
At most schools, the event is typically called Take Back the Night, as it was at Harvard in the past.
This year, however, the event’s organizers changed the title from Take Back the Night to Hear Me Now because, according to Yumusak, “we think that’s a more suitable title for the event because not all sexual assault happens at night and you could not take it back, some people feel that way.”
The event was co-sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, Response Peer Counseling, the Women’s Center, and the Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators at Harvard.
Beyoncé’s “Halo,” Katy Perry’s “Roar,” and one student’s original song were among the works performed Wednesday evening.
The event concluded with a candlelight vigil.
“I thought it was really great. All the performances were very heartfelt and touching. It was very real and a great time to stop and think,” Nikki Charifson, a senior at Boston University who attended, said.
Dean of Freshmen and interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman '67, Ivy Yard Resident Dean Michael C. Ranen, and other House staff were present at the event.
Still, Yumusak was critical that not more administrators attended the event.
“This is also an event that the administration is invited to to show their support for survivors,” she said.
This year, Sexual Assault Awareness Month is particularly salient as the College and entire University prepares to implement the recommendations of a recent report on sexual assault prevention at Harvard. The report offered a wide-ranging and frequently critical assessment of the “deeply troubling” realities of sexual assault across Harvard’s 12 schools, with a particular focus on the resources and social scene of the College.
There are a number of other events scheduled throughout the month, including talks, a walk, and a conversation scheduled for the College’s annual Visitas admitted students weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­The Harvard baseball team dropped its sixth straight contest on Wednesday afternoon as clutch hitting and strong pitching propelled Northeastern to a 3-2 victory over the Crimson in a Beanpot semifinal in Brookline. The win gave the Huskies (14-12, 3-2 Colonial Athletic Association) a spot in the Beanpot championship game, to be played April 20.
Harvard was the home team because the game had originally been scheduled to be played at O’Donnell Field. The Crimson (7-15, 0-4 Ivy League) will settle for a spot in the consolation game for the second year in a row and will take on the loser of Boston College and Massachusetts, which will be played on April 13. The Eagles and Minutemen already met once earlier in the season in which BC defeated Massachusetts, 11-5.
“Today was a much better game for us than any of our games last weekend,” co-captain Matt Sanders said. “Obviously, we wanted to come out on the winning end of it, but I think they’re a very good team, they had some guys who hit pretty well and had a couple key hits in big situations.”
Freshman rightfielder Cam Walsh singled up the middle in the fifth inning to drive in sophomore shortstop Max Burt, the hero of last season’s matchup between the intrastate rivals, and gave Northeastern the lead for good.
Freshman pitcher Simon Rosenblum-Larson got the ball for Harvard after struggling to miss bats against Holy Cross last week. The Madison, Wis. native threw four innings and surrendered two runs, exiting the game with the score knotted at two apiece.
“Simon over the last few weeks has adopted the role of midweek starter,” Sanders said. “He’s showing improvement every week and I think that this was his best start. He improved from his last start which is great for us.”
The teams traded runs in the game’s first third. The Huskies got on the board first in the second inning as sophomore designated hitter Zach Perry and Walsh singled before being driven in by freshman first baseman Jake Farrell’s triple, one of just three extra base hits on the day for the two teams.
The Crimson got both runs back two at-bats later. Junior shortstop Drew Reid started the rally after reaching on an error by Northeastern third baseman Charlie McConnell. Freshman centerfielder Ben Skinner bunted his teammate over to second and senior second baseman Mitch Klug was hit by a pitch. Freshman leftfielder Trent Bryan drove in Reid and Bryan scored on a John Fallon single.
“It was pretty big after this past weekend,” senior pitcher T.J. Laurisch said. “We just went out there and played our game. It’s good to get some guys out there, get some confidence. Pitchers threw well, defense played pretty well, we saw some good pitchers. It was good to get out there and see we can compete with a lot of teams going into this weekend.”
Junior Kevin Rex spelled Rosenblum-Larson and took the loss for Harvard after giving up the Walsh single. The Crimson’s offense was held in check for the rest of the afternoon as Northeastern manager Mike Glavine trotted out a trio against which Harvard could only muster three hits.
Reid, who has been in a slump at the plate to start the season, was the only Harvard player to have more than one of the team’s six hits. The two singles raised the defensive whiz’s batting average to .231. It was the seventh time this season that the Crimson has scored two runs or fewer.
“I think we played defense really well,” Laurisch said. “The conditions weren’t exactly the best. We’re competing out there. There were a couple innings where a couple things happened out there and we didn’t score runs, but that’s baseball. I think on the whole it was a pretty good game. We just happened to be on the wrong end of it.”
Harvard’s bullpen held serve down the stretch but the offense could not answer the bell. Seniors Laurisch and Shaun Rubin, brightspots in the team’s otherwise forgettable weekend, conceded just two hits through the game’s final four innings. Rubin’s earned run average sits at a miniscule 1.35 for the season.
“You need guys like that to step up,” Sanders said. “It was great that it’s been two seniors. T.J.’s a guy who’s had success in the past and he’s starting to find that again. Shaun hasn’t pitched as much coming into this season, but I think he’s going to be a huge piece for us moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In a game that went down to the wire last Wednesday night, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (5-5, 1-1 Ivy League) ultimately fell to Albany by a final score of 10-9. This Saturday, after a weekend off, the Crimson looks to rebound from the narrow defeat as it faces off against Ancient Eight foe, Cornell (4-4, 1-2), on Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca, N.Y.
“We’ve started to focus on ourselves and gear up for Cornell,” sophomore midfielder Robert Mencke said. “They have really good attackmen and a good system in play, so this will really make us put that much more into it to make sure we cover all ends.”
Despite a recent string of losses, the Crimson has demonstrated an unwillingness to go down without a fight. While four of the past five games have gone against the Crimson, the defeats were extremely close with the margin of difference hovering between one and three points for each loss.
On the other hand, the squad’s most recent victory against Dartmouth was a blowout as it put away the Big Green, 18-8.
“We really played a good game against Dartmouth,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said.  “We did well facing off and we really executed on both ends of the field. Our offense consistently scored throughout the game and our defense was making stops consistently as well.”
The Crimson is placing heavy emphasis on replicating this style of execution, which rested on staying composed, having each player focus on his position’s job, and staying balanced on offense and defense. However, in comparison, the Big Red arguably had an even more impressive showing against Dartmouth. It outscored the Big Green in every quarter and won 19 out of 27 faceoffs, tallying a final score of 19-4.
Looking at the two teams’ overall records and past results, it is likely that this matchup will be a close one. Last year, the Crimson pulled off the victory in a dramatic fashion as then junior attacker Devin Dwyer clinched it with a goal with 32 seconds left in the fourth quarter.  After four competitive periods, this game-winner resulted in a final score of 10-9.
The Garden City native, Dwyer, currently maintains a 43 game point streak, the fourth longest active streak in the nation, and has been one of the team’s most dependable players this season.
Meanwhile for the Big Red, freshman attacker Colton Rupp has led the offensive charge, with a team-leading 18 goals on the year. and scores at a 40 percent clip.
With the team’s last game coming on March 30 in the Albany loss, the team has had extra time to prepare for its league opponent.
“Obviously, it’s an Ivy League game against a good program on the road,” Wojcik said. “Cornell is a team that coming off a big win this past weekend.  But, we have about 10 days from our Albany game to our Cornell game. We’ve had a lot of time to practice and work on our team playing our game.”
Judging by the formidable offenses of both teams, this game is also likely to be a high scoring affair.  Harvard sophomore goalkeeper Robert Shaw will likely match up against Big Red senior Brennan Donville in the opposing net.  In his 10 games to date, Shaw has earned a total of five wins for the Crimson and posted a 53.7 save percentage. The more seasoned Donville, on the other hand, has played in 24 games with eight wins and four losses in his career. He currently maintains a 49.1 save percentage.
Another factor that could play a role in the Crimson’s performance is the crowd in Ithaca.  Last year’s large turnout at home was highly beneficial for the team, and playing without similar moral support this year may provide an extra hurdle for the skidding Crimson.
Harvard is currently 1-3 on the year in away games, while Cornell has performed well at home, earning an impressive win over current No. 20 Virginia and only losing to current No. 14 Penn State by one goal on its home field.
“It’s going to be a dogfight for sure,” Mencke said. “They’re going to come at us with everything they’ve got.”

As Advising Fortnight draws to a close, students and faculty alike vie for the attention of freshmen at various concentration events. Of course, the best way to to get college students to like you or to sign up for your stuff is to shower them with free things. So, for the overwhelmed freshmen trying to choose a concentration, Flyby has a foolproof way to narrow down your choices: It all comes down to food.
After all, if you’re going to spending the next three years mingling at concentration cocktail hours and senior thesis dinners, it’s important to know what kind of food you’re getting into. Here were some of the food highlights from Advising Fortnight.
South Asian Studies takes top prize for best concentration with some tasty samosas and chicken tikka at their advising event. If you’re like us at Flyby, then you can never pass up on good South Asian food and chai!
Music came in with a strong second place with their platters of mini sandwiches. (Quite fancy—they were even labeled with small toothpicks.) Bite sized desserts rounded out a worthwhile advising lunch.
Plenty of Thai food was going around at the Applied Math fair. A hoard of freshmen crowded Ticknor Lounge to eat some pad Thai and wide rice noodles. Rumor has it there was even enough for students to take some leftovers for later. Any excuse to skip more Berg meals is a good one, we were told.
Tagged as an Ice Cream “Social” (because “Social” Studies), the interdisciplinary concentration had plenty of flavors of Lizzy’s ice cream available. Students threw chocolate sauce, sprinkles, and cherries on their own sundaes. Flyby thinks that’s a pretty solid reward for committing to write a thesis.
The Economics department was prepared for a party with twenty boxes of pizza for their prospective students. Flyby was a little disappointed that we made the trek up to the third floor of Littauer only to discover cheese pizza. We were told that “toppings were coming later,” but it was unclear if the pepperoni ever showed up. We guess you don’t need to put in too much effort when you’re the largest concentration at Harvard.
We know that choosing among Harvard’s 49 concentrations is hard. But keep in mind, the quality of food at advising events will probably be the only thing you remember from Advising Fortnight, so why not make it worthwhile? And for all of the upperclassmen lamenting HUDS meals and worried about their job prospects… it’s not too late to switch concentrations.

Dear Harvard,
It’s ya girls Betty and Hyemi, day one homies since Freshman Orientation Week, relentless blockmates, and the dynamic Flyby journalistic duo. We’re two fun-loving junior girls living in Dunster, and we want to share our vast pools of knowledge and wisdom with the rest of Harvard. So we’re bringing back Listen Up, your favorite and most reliable biweekly advice column, where you ask the questions and we provide sage answers. Don’t worry, submissions are anonymous and we know you have burning questions about life. How can I practice good hallway bathroom etiquette? What is the best flavor of Rubinoff (Hyemi: The answer is none.; Betty: The answer is not none.)? Why does the HUDS apple crisp not taste as good anymore? Are we actually getting a Yardfest artist? 
Submit your questions here about anything and everything, and leave the rest to us.
Let the games begin.
XOXO,
Betty and Hyemi
