After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action advocacy group, has subpoenaed several public high schools to aid its ongoing legal case against Harvard. The suit accuses the University of discrimination against Asian American applicants. The schools named in the subpoenas—Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Stuyvesant High School, and Monta Vista High School—are among the top high schools in the country, consistently sending a large number of their graduates to Harvard and other top schools. Nevertheless, we oppose the action of SFFA to involve high schools, as their demands bring unnecessary trouble to students who do not wish to be involved in this case.
SFFA’s subpoena requires that these high schools divulge the racial demographics of students who applied to Harvard. By using the personal information of applicants who have no desire to be involved in the lawsuit, SFFA seeks to invade students’ privacy to advance their political cause. Indeed, they are unfairly drawing high school students into a heavily politicized and controversial debate for SFFA’s benefit. Instead, we would urge the organization to solely represent the interests of students who have requested legal assistance. This is especially true given that this subpoena places a burden on these schools to collect information in a relatively short window of time—the lawsuit will only remain in the discovery period until June 20.
As SFFA has chosen racially homogeneous high schools to include in its case, it is unlikely that the requested admissions reports will shed light on the issue. Sixty-one percent of students at Thomas Jefferson, 73 percent of those at Stuyvesant, and 78 percent of those at Monta Vista are of Asian descent. Conducting a statistical analysis of their applicants to Harvard is unlikely to yield particularly informative results. The majority of applicants—both admitted and rejected—from these schools are likely to be Asian American because the majority of students in general are Asian American. Comparisons among different racial groups’ acceptance rate will be unreliable indicators of any pattern of discrimination.
Indeed, these schools serve as examples of why, as we have previously opined, affirmative action is still necessary. Stuyvesant is only 0.63 percent black and 2.48 percent Hispanic. One of New York City’s other top high schools, Staten Island Technical High School, recently admitted just one black student to its next class.
The lack of Latino and black students at feeder schools for Harvard and other top universities should illustrate the disadvantages faced by these racial minorities early on in the education system. When Latino and black students are denied admission to these schools, they are denied access to a prestigious public education and a well-prepared advising office. In short, they are shut out of the resources needed to get into top colleges.
We would urge such high schools to consider the factors that inhibit minority students from gaining admission. These include the disproportionate amount of community support and funding given to prosperous high schools in wealthy, predominantly white and Asian suburbs like Monta Vista.
Even within school districts, however, inequalities persist. The Specialized High School Admissions Test in New York City—a single test that determines acceptance into the city’s top public high schools, including Stuyvesant—appears objective at first glance, but in reality perpetuates a racial achievement gap. Low-income minority students are less likely to pay for test-prep classes and other tools needed to maximize one’s score.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a recent conversation with students at the Harvard Advocate, Martha Tedeschi, director of the Harvard Art Museums, asked whether we felt it is important for the museum to actively make itself a place for the wider Cambridge community, as opposed to a primarily educational museum for Harvard. The question initially struck me as the deceptively open-ended kind that has one correct answer—how could we say that we did not want the museum to open itself up to the community?—but also made me realize that I had never conceptualized the Harvard Art Museums as a place “for us.”
Tedeschi spoke in a room around which flowers had been scattered to welcome the warm weather, with the windows overlooking an afternoon distinctly colored with spring—the asphalt roads warm gray, the sky flushed generously blue, passersby walking without wintertime’s wind-defying shoulder-clench. The strange surprise that came with her question, the reconsideration of a space I frequent, felt inextricably associated with the season.
In the past two years, the weeks from mid-October to the end of March have seemed to me to vanish in an icy haze, circumscribed by the same vistas: library, dining hall, classroom, bedroom. But, come spring, expanses of outdoor space suddenly reenter our consciousness. The snow-obscured, inhospitably cold places are free: now we can play frisbee and spikeball, sit by Weeks Bridge, go for a run, or idle on a roof. In the sunlight, an afternoon at the art museum, a student production, a musical performance, or a film festival seems like a natural use of an afternoon rather than something that we “should” be doing. There is also the mental prospect of change, in both the literal and figurative sense. We move out of our rooms, to new places for the summer, into new institutions or the “real world,” home. Everything comes unbolted—daily rhythms, the intent dash from heated building to heated building; relationships anchored in the needs of the semesters; perceptions of the place around us, filtered through exhaustion or habit. Warm weather makes the campus new, strange, and more ours.
The conclusion the students attending the talk arrived at was that, of course, the Harvard Art Museums should make concerted efforts to bring the public in. However, we also all admitted that we went to the art museum far less than we wanted to. The question’s premise caught me off guard because during the semesters, even as I did homework in the café or took ten minute walks around the galleries to recharge between classes, I had somehow forgotten where I was.
There are so many lovely places for us, and/or open to us. Through the last stretch of the semester, we will survive projects and finals just in time for us to realize how little time we have here. So, study when you must, but wander when you can. Read in the Child Memorial Library, the Woodberry Poetry Room, the film library at the top of Sever. Walk around the Harvard Art Museums and the Carpenter Center. Sit in the sunken garden outside the basement of CGIS South, the benches outside the Barker Center at the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Quincy, or Dudley Garden behind Lamont. Go across the bridge to the Business School and admire Baker Library. See your first show at the Repertory Theatre. Walk around the Harvard Book Store; go downstairs for the used books, or stay for an author event. And then maybe walk to Fresh Pond; take the free M2 shuttle into Boston for the Public Gardens, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Institute of Contemporary Art, and the harbor.
Material settings, and their inhabitants, shape us. I have spent the semester writing about how individual spaces have influenced my thought, but I will never have the time or omniscience for every experience you could have. Go out and get to know the people and places that surround you. There is time now—as always, though it may not always feel like it—to surprise yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Visitas has concluded and reading period has come again, signaling a time of endings and beginnings. With the entrance of the Class of 2021 comes a conclusion for many members of the senior class, encouraging moments of reflection and making each minute spent that much more savory. As a junior myself, the winds of change are hitting me too, as I prepare for the “last of firsts” era that is senior year. In this time of reflection, I sit here pondering my three years at Harvard College, and I find that I continually ask myself the question: Is it worth it?
This past year at Harvard has been turbulent, to say the least, and it has put parts of my identity in conflict. In the fall, when the Harvard University Dining Services strike caused a 22-day stagnation of food services, I was of two minds. On the one hand, as a low-income student and the son of a single-mother who worked in housekeeping, I viscerally sympathized with the HUDS workers who I’ve come to know and admire—and who have helped me adjust to school. Yet, on the other hand, I also felt the effects of the strike on a personal level. While my friends were able to eat out on a consistent basis, I didn’t have that opportunity, which meant going hungry some nights. The Crimson Cash stipend didn’t help much either, since it was only available for use at a small subset of vendors in the Square.
Around the same time, I also began experiencing minor depressive symptoms, which were only heightened by rejections from several job opportunities and fellowships. In those moments of rejection, I felt suffocated under the weight of being the first in my family to go to (and hopefully finish) college.
While I am grateful to attend what is arguably the best university in the world, being the first in my family adds a special kind of pressure. Being “The Only One” means that success is not a luxury, but a mandate. And it means that the comforting words you hear all the time on campus—“You shouldn’t put that pressure on yourself!”—don’t apply to you. Where I come from, there’s less than a 10 percent chance of attending college, which means I am here not only for me, but for the people I grew up with, the people who raised me, and the children who look up to me. I have the chance to return home, and represent the small possibility that, yes, it’s possible to succeed. (If you’re curious about the link between neighborhood and college attendance, put in your zip code here. Mine is 10454.)
This spring, Harvard rejected a bridge program that could’ve helped students like me have an easier time adjusting to the fast-paced, pressure cooker environment that is Harvard University. Though I understand the logic of not wanting to “single out” a subset of the student population, to paraphrase Pierre Bourdieu, particular habits privileged at this institution aren’t given to all students. For students who didn’t attend an elite boarding school or live in a Northeastern city or come from a college-educated lineage, Harvard brings unique challenges. These challenges only continue to grow and become more unbearable as one ascends through the ranks of Harvard. The additional expectation of being able to handle it all leaves little space to fail, and therefore no room to learn. Education becomes a formality, extracurriculars a career, and “hey, how are you?” a question whose response we have no investment in.
All these factors and more weigh heavily on my mind as I consider what I want from my last year at this place. Though the name “Harvard” is empowering and I have definitely felt myself grow into a better person while here, it has not come without difficulty. And there has not been a week where I have not asked myself “Is it worth it?”
To be honest, I still don’t know. But with one more year left, I hope I can find the answer—whatever it may be.

UPDATED: April 28, 2017 at 1:50 p.m.
As Divest Harvard activists cheered comments from a Harvard Management Company official that the natural resources portfolio is "pausing" investments in fossil fuels, the University maintained that the remarks did not represent a change in investment strategy.
HMC head of natural resources Colin Butterfield said at a Business School event Monday that his portfolio is “pausing” investments in minerals, oil, and gas, because those particular assets are not profitable and are harmful to the environment. He said that Harvard still invests in fossil fuels through other other portfolios.
Butterfield’s comments prompted celebration Wednesday from members of Divest Harvard—a campus activist group that has long rallied for Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry—who lauded the University for “taking a significant step toward fossil fuel divestment” in a press release.
“We’re heartened to hear Butterfield acknowledge the gross injustice of climate change,” Isa Flores-Jones ’19, a member of the group, wrote. “Oil, coal, and natural gas are no longer economically, or morally, viable options.”
Emily Guadagnoli, a spokesperson from HMC, wrote in a statement that Butterfield’s comments neither represented a move towards divestment nor a significant change in Harvard's investment practices. Butterfield was “referring solely to his analysis of investments within the natural resources portfolio and how they contribute to the financial strength of the endowment,” she wrote.
“Oil and gas have not been an area of focus for the natural resources portfolio and Mr. Butterfield noted that he did not anticipate a change in this approach,” the statement reads. “It certainly was not a change in Harvard’s stance on divestment from fossil fuels, which was laid out in 2013 and remains the university’s position.”
Naima Drecker-Waxman ’18, another member of Divest Harvard, said in an interview that while she is optimistic Harvard will ultimately stop investing in fossil fuels, she does not believe the University will make that move without “pressure” from student activists.
“At the same time, it’s really important to us that Harvard has an institutional policy that says that this is not just a temporary thing, and a five year plan for getting out of indirect investments,” Drecker-Waxman said. “We know that pressure will be necessary to see this, and we don’t see that Harvard will necessary take that step without it.”
Divest has held several demonstrations on campus in recent years demanding that Harvard withdraw completely from the coal industry and put a moratorium on broader investments in fossil fuels. Most recently, members of the group barricaded entrances to University Hall, a building in Harvard Yard that houses several of the University’s top administrators.
Harvard does not currently invest in the coal industry, but has said it reserves the right to do so in the future. University President Drew G. Faust has also repeatedly countered Divest’s demands, arguing that Harvard can better combat climate change through research rather than withdrawing its investments.
Amid major layoffs at HMC, the firm has decided to keep its natural resources portfolio managed in-house, even as it moves to outsource most of its other asset classes to external investors.

Former Harvard track coach Walter W. Johnson ’71 was arrested and charged with the possession and distribution of child pornography Thursday, the United States Attorney’s office announced.
Johnson served as a track coach for the Harvard men’s and women’s teams from 1982 to 2006. After more than 20 years  at Harvard, Johnson began working as the assistant track coach and a special education teaching assistant at Wellesley High and Middle Schools. He played on the football team in his junior and senior years and was the captain of the track team while an undergraduate at Harvard.
For months, Johnson allegedly exchanged messages containing sexually explicit comments and images with users on the website Craigslist.
Federal agents began investigating Johnson in January, eventually tracing explicit Craigslist messages back to email accounts belonging to Johnson. Agents searched Johnson’s home in Framingham, Mass. Thursday morning, and initial on-site forensic analysis found child pornography on Johnson’s electronic devices, according to the criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office Thursday.
During the search of his home, Johnson confirmed that he was the user of the email accounts and had used Craigslist personal advertisements to exchange explicit messages with other individuals, primarily men. Homeland Security Investigation’s Boston’s Cyber Crimes and Child Exploitation Group carried out the investigation along with the Internet Crimes Against Children task force and Framingham Police Department.
Charged with one count of distribution and one count of possession of child pornography, Johnson will be detained until his hearing, which is scheduled for May 1. Distribution of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum five year sentence that can extend up to 20 years with three years of supervised release afterwards and a $250,000 fine. Possession of child pornography could yield Johnson another 10 years in prison and an additional $250,000 fine.

UPDATED: April 27, 2017 at 11:50 p.m.
After three years as Director of the Institute of Politics, Maggie Williams will step down from the role and leave the IOP at the end of this semester.
Williams’s departure was announced in an email from the IOP Executive Team to IOP members Wednesday morning. Williams will return to her work at Griffin Williams Critical Point Management, a business consulting firm she co-founded with Patrick J. Griffin, a professor of Government at American University.
Former U.S. Congressman William D. “Bill” Delahunt will serve as interim director while a search for Williams’ replacement gets immediately underway. Delahunt also served as interim director while Williams was on leave last fall to serve on Hillary Clinton's transition team.
“Since 2014, the Institute of Politics has been fortunate to have Maggie Williams serving as our Director. We are writing to inform you that Maggie will be leaving the IOP at the conclusion of this semester,” the Executive Team’s email said.
“It’s been a joy,” Williams said of her tenure.
 Williams cited her long commute and feeling that she had achieved her primary goals as her reason for leaving.
“I think that there are a lot of things that I wanted to do here that, to a large degree, I have accomplished in many ways,” she said. “I think I really focused on thinking about what skill sets are needed for politics today—some are the same ones, some are new ones.”
Undergraduate President of the IOP Jesse I. Shelburne ’18 said Williams’ departure “was totally her call.”
“She just decided she wanted to go back home, and I know it was a hard decision for her,” Shelburne said. “We’re sad to see her leave but we’re happy for all the work she put in.”
Dean of the Harvard Kennedy School Doug W. Elmendorf also announced Williams’s departure in an email to Kennedy School affiliates.
“I am grateful to Maggie for her many accomplishments as Director of the IOP and for her dedication to the IOP’s crucial mission,” Elmendorf wrote.
Williams’s tenure as director was recently marked by controversy, when some critics said her role on Clinton campaign was a breach of the IOP’s commitment to nonpartisanship and several alumni and students called for Williams’ resignation.
Defenders of Williams said that it was within her rights to pursue political work and that it would not compromise non-partisanship at the IOP.  Williams returned to the IOP directorship in January following Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Shelburne said Williams’s departure was unrelated to the controversy over her leave of absence.
“I haven’t heard anything that relates the two of those,” Shelburne said.
During her time at the IOP, Williams helped build the Institute’s program on Politics of Race and Ethnicity as well as STEAM, an initiative for students to learn about the way politics involves Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math. Before becoming Director, Williams served on the Institute’s Advisory Committee for seven years.
“I think she was really instrumental in helping us bring in people to the IOP who wouldn’t have necessarily been interested otherwise,” Shelburne said.
Before coming to the IOP, Williams was a top adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton for over 20 years. Williams served as Hillary Clinton’s chief of staff while she was First Lady, and later as her 2008 Presidential campaign director.
Kathryn A. Bussey '17, the former student president of the IOP, said she was sad to see Williams go.
“Maggie has been a transformative leader for the IOP, and I will miss regularly receiving her inspiring words of advice as she moves on to the next chapter of her life,” Bussey wrote in a statement.
Williams said her favorite part of her time at the IOP was working with students.
“Of all the things I love about the IOP, it’s the students. It’s just the energy and the imagination and the willingness to work hard and do anything,” Williams said.
Williams will vacate her position on May 26.

UPDATED: April 28, 2017 at 12:15 a.m. 
When Andrew J. O’Donohue ’18 glanced at his phone moments before leaving for Yardfest, he expected anything but to receive an email notifying him that he had been selected to join Harvard’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the country’s oldest academic honor society.
“It was a really incongruous time to be commended for scholarly achievement and diligence," O’Donohue, who studies Social Studies, said. “I was incredibly shocked and excited.”
O’Donahue joins 23 other juniors who received the award, which honors students who have not only succeeded academically but who have displayed intellectual integrity, openness to other views, and a number of intellectual interests, according to Phi Beta Kappa’s website.
“I’m grateful that selection wasn’t dependent on our GPA exclusively,” Ellie M. Lasater-Guttmann ’18 said. “It seems that they really value breadth and depth of courses, which is something that’s really important to me.”
This year’s “Junior 24” study fifteen different concentrations ranging from Computer Science to Romance Languages and Literatures. Economics, Social Studies, and Chemical and Physical Biology each posted three honorees, together comprising over a third of the honorees.
Pforzheimer House saw the most juniors named to the honor society, with four students receiving the award. Quincy House was the only House not represented in this year’s Junior 24.
Lasater-Guttmann, who recently switched her concentration to Philosophy, said her acceptance to Phi Beta Kappa is a testament to how the University values a wide range of academic pursuits.
“I think this shows the fact that Harvard really does value interdisciplinary work,” she said.
Other honorees said they see the accomplishment as a result of the supportive advising they have experienced throughout their time at Harvard.
“I am really grateful to everyone who made this possible, especially my advisors, parents and friends,” Annika Gompers ’18, an Integrative Biology concentrator, said.
Rob J. Hopkirk ’18, an English concentrator, said he wasn’t expecting the honor—he was procrastinating on a final paper when the email came in.
“I’ve been thinking ‘why me?’ Everyone at Harvard is so smart and driven, so ‘I’ve just been thinking  what have I done?” he said. “I am thankful I was able to pursue my passion and someone noticed.”
“The first thing I did after I got the email was to call my parents and thank them,” Hopkirk added.
The Junior 24 will be formally inducted at a ceremony on May 1. Here is the full list:

Brigham and Women’s Hospital—a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital—will pay $10 million to settle allegations of research fraud, the United States Attorney’s Office announced Thursday.
A stem cell lab run by former Medical School professor Piero Anversa and former associate Medical School professors Annarosa Leri and Jan Kajstura obtained federal research funding using “manipulated and falsified information,” according to a press release from the Department of Justice. The government alleges that researchers failed to follow protocol, fabricated data and images, and submitted misleading data in National Institutes of Health research grants and in publications.
 Brigham and Women’s Hospital terminated its relationship with the three researchers and disclosed the allegations against the Anversa lab to the federal government, according to federal prosecutors. The Anversa lab has received around $42 million from the National Institutes of Health, the Boston Globe reported.
In a press release, Acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb commended Brigham and Women’s for disclosing the allegations against the researchers but criticized falsifying medical data.
“Individuals and institutions that receive research funding from NIH have an obligation to conduct their research honestly and not to alter results to conform with unproven hypotheses,” Weinreb said. “Medical research fraud not only wastes scarce government resources but also undermines the scientific process and the search for better treatments for serious diseases.
The Medical School and Brigham and Women’s launched an investigation into the Anversa lab in 2014, when a 2011 paper on the regenerative power of heart stem cells came under scrutiny for alleged scientific misconduct. Around that time, the American Heart Association’s Circulation magazine retracted a 2012 paper from the researchers after a review by the Medical School and Brigham and Women’s found its data to be “sufficiently compromised.”
Anversa and Leri admitted to falsifying data, but sued Harvard and Brigham and Women’s for wrongfully damaging their careers during the investigations of the papers in question. The two also allege that Kajstura altered data without their knowledge in the 2012 Circulation paper.
Also on Thursday, Brigham and Women’s offered buyouts to 1,600 employees in an effort to downsize its workforce in the face of budget constraints.

Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital, will offer a voluntary contract buyout for 1,600 employees—roughly 9 percent of its workforce—to downsize its staff amid increasing expenses.
In a statement Thursday, the hospital reaffirmed its commitment to its patients while acknowledging the need to “right-size” its workforce. According to the Boston Globe, labor constitutes roughly two-thirds of the hospital's operating costs.
“Our expenses continue to rise while constraints by government and payers are keeping our revenues flat,” the statement reads. “This is negatively affecting our financial health, and we need to work differently in order to sustain our mission for the future.”
 Two big projects have also weighed down the hospital financially— a $510 million, 675,000 square foot outpatient and research building and a new computer software system, which launched in 2015 and is estimated to have cost $335 million, according to the Boston Globe.
“We owe it to our current patients—and those who will need our care in the future—to tackle the unprecedented financial challenges we are facing so that Brigham Health is here to care for patients, transform medicine and educate future health care professionals for generations to come,” the hospital’s statement reads.
Around 18,000 people currently work at Brigham and Women’s. The Longwood hospital is part of the Partners HealthCare System, a collection of hospitals which includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Newton-Wellesley Hospital, among others.
The Globe also reported that only workers over the age of 60 are eligible for the early retirement buyout, which includes one year of base salary. Physicians, researchers, and Harvard Medical School faculty are ineligible for the offer.
The buyouts also come as President Donald Trump seeks to stem federal funding to the National Institutes of Health in a budget proposal that has been widely condemned by Harvard scientists and administrators. Brigham and Women’s is a top recipient of NIH grants, according to its website, and has an annual research budget of more than $485 million.
“The hospital community is embracing the challenge and finding innovative ways to improve care while lowering the cost trend,” Tim Gens, executive vice president of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association, wrote in a statement to the Globe. “However, with changes to the healthcare system being proposed in Washington, the challenges are becoming more complex and threatening.”
Also on Thursday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced that Brigham and Women’s will pay $10 millions to resolve allegations of stem-cell research fraud. The researchers, who are no longer affiliated with Brigham and Women’s, allegedly included falsified data in publications as well as grant applications to the NIH.

Six Harvard students—along with 14 other activists—were arrested Monday afternoon after they held a sit-in at the Suffolk County House of Corrections in protest of the detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants.
“So 30 people sat in for about an hour and a half, we had bands there playing in front of the detention facility, and then the police moved to arrest about 20 people,” said Kevin E. O’Donnell ’17, who participated in the protest and was arrested.
O’Donnell said he and other demonstrators spent about eight hours in jail before a bondsman set each individual’s bail at $40. All six Harvard students were able to pay their way out.
The six undergraduates—five of whom are members of the Student Labor Action Movement, a Harvard student activist group—and the other protesters were charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing. They appeared in Boston Municipal Court on Tuesday, according to Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson Renee N. Algarin.
“In each case, the disorderly conduct charge was dismissed prior to arraignment and the trespassing charge was converted to a civil infraction, on which a responsible finding entered on the record and a fine of $50 was imposed,” Algarin wrote in an emailed statement Thursday.
“It was basically a parking ticket,” O’Donnell said of the court-imposed punishment.
Cosecha, a national immigrant rights group, organized the sit-in, as well as a march from Clifford Park in Roxbury to the detention center in Dorchester beforehand. Roughly 30 people marched, and 30 more joined the demonstrations by the correction facility, according to O’Donnell.
Cosecha organizers told The Boston Globe that the sit-in—which they said was among the biggest acts of civil disobedience nationwide since President Donald Trump’s inauguration—was intended to bring attention to an upcoming national immigrants’ strike, scheduled to take place May 1. Organizers across the United States staged a previous “Day Without Immigrants” in mid-February.
O’Donnell said he hoped the protest also sent a message to Massachusetts government officials.
“This was a call for Massachusetts to stop cooperating with [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and deporting families and splitting people up,” he said.
In the months since Trump’s election, Cambridge has reaffirmed its status as a “sanctuary city” for undocumented immigrants, at times drawing fire from the federal government.
Harvard has also taken steps to support its undocumented population: administrators held a town hall with immigration experts in January, and University President Drew G. Faust has pledged to continue lobbying Congress to protect for undocumented students.
O’Donnell said his time in jail was “long and boring.” He said he and the other five Harvard students spent roughly two hours in a holding cell—where officials took their fingerprints and mugshots—before entering individual cells to wait for the bondsman.
O’Donnell said he thought the sit-in went well, calling it “one of many steps” towards achieving permanent protection for undocumented immigrants in the United States. But he said he found his time in prison sobering.
“There were lots of people in there who weren’t there by choice, so that’s a thing that I kept in mind while I was there,” he said. “We had the privilege to be able to take this risk and then get out okay, but there’s a lot of people who go through that system who do not.”
“It was a firm reminder of why we have so much work to do on both the immigration and the criminal justice front,” O’Donnell added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new Institute of Politics poll found that just 32 percent of 18-to-29-year-old Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s performance in the White House.
That statistic, part of the IOP’s biannual Public Opinion Project poll, locatesTrump's approval among young people well below the average approval rating, which Fivethirtyeight places at 42 percent.  The Spring 2017 poll is the first since Trump’s inauguration, and outlines young Americans’ views on his administration's policies, as well as their attitudes towards politics and civic engagement writ large. The IOP surveyed over 2,500 18 to 29-year-olds.
In addition to gauging overall approval of the President’s performance, the poll surveyed young people on specific policy areas such as Trump's handling of the economy and efforts to combat ISIS, for which approval ranged in percentages from the high 20s to mid 30s. The poll also found that 68 percent of young people find Trump’s use of Twitter “mostly inappropriate.”
Released Tuesday, the poll also questioned young people on broader socio-political questions. Fifty-nine percent of young Americans said they want to “do what they can to help unite and not further divide the country”, a finding that was shared regardless of party identification, gender, race, and geography.
“While we spend a lot of time talking about what divides us, younger millennials are seeking leaders who will unite us,” said John Della Volpe, Director of Polling at Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics.
Although the percentage of young people who disagreed with the statement that “politics is not relevant to my life right now” has increased from 40 to 47 percent, the proportion of young people interested in public service dropped from 31 to 25 percent.
On average, 9 percent of 18-29 year olds expressed interest in pursuing some kind of public office between now and when they turn 50. The percentage is higher for third party voters at 19 percent, and slightly higher for men at 11 percent.
The poll indicated that levels of trust in elected officials have remained low. The most trusted governmental entities in 2017 according to the poll are the U.S. Military, at 50 percent, with Congress earning the lowest trust ratings at 20 percent. The trust of young people in the President declined from 41 percent to 24 percent compared to 2012, according to the poll.
The poll also indicated that young people are wary of the media they consume. The poll found that Snapchat and Instagram were the most rapidly growing social networks among young people. Respondents reported that they thought almost half of their Facebook newsfeed constituted “fake news.”
The poll found that the best predictors of a young person’s political party are his or her views on race, health care, and guns. Over half of responding Democrats did not know a gun owner, and almost half of Republicans disagree that healthcare is a basic human right.

It’s a little after 9 p.m. on a Friday night at Harvard, and the Yard is quiet. The freshman class is scattered, likely congregating in dorms for pregames or hunching over laptops to study for midterms. As the night continues, students empty out of the Yard—perhaps on their way to parties or to get late night eats in the Square.
Tonight, however, several yellow school buses pull away from Annenberg. Students sit two to a row, where they chatter excitedly with their neighbors and shout across seat rows. No one mentions the paper they have due.
These students are participants in Harvard’s “Into the Hub” program, an event series that offers freshman the chance to get off campus and participate in various leisure activities. The program offers freshmen an alternative to on-campus social scenes as well as the chance to explore Boston and surrounding areas, completely free of charge.
In an academic year where campus dialogue has often centered on a lack of inclusive social spaces, the Freshman Dean’s Office has increasingly turned its attention to providing open social opportunities for students not just within the gates of Harvard, but also beyond them.
“[The program aims] to give students alternative social options on Friday and Saturday nights,” said Marie Keil ’14, an FDO fellow who now presides over the program.
Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67 echoed Keil, and said the program offers students a means to feel at home on campus.
“This is an opportunity to make people see how easy it is to get off campus,” Dingman said. ”More importantly, it’s meant to heighten students’ sense of belonging.”
In its current form, Into the Hub is only in its second year. The program evolved from the long-standing “Through the Gates” initiative, in which the FDO sponsored trips into Boston for freshmen and faculty members.
“The main difference with Through the Gates trips from Into the Hub trips was that initiative that was based on getting faculty and students to interact as well, so each Through the Gates trip had a faculty person or a staff person who led the trip and often designed the trip,” said Katherine W. Steele, director of College Initiatives and Student Development at the FDO.
Through the Gates trips would often launch during Opening Days and were sometimes extended into the academic year, with professors leading small groups of students on everything from kayaking on the Charles River to taking a Duck Tour to a walking trip through the North End.
“They were often daytime trips, almost like what you would have done in middle school or high school in terms of something that felt like a field trip,” Steele said.
Through the Gates excursions were also not free of charge; if admissions tickets or transportation were required, students needed to pay the fee. According to Steele, the FDO had a very limited amount of financial aid available due to lack of budgetary support.
“I don’t think that it was really achieving our goals with making sure that the Harvard experience is as accessible to everyone as we want it to be,” Steele said.
Steele explained that, while the FDO developed many aspects of the new offerings, the vision came into fruition under the leadership of Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. In the fall of 2015, the College allocated $30,000 to pilot the Into the Hub program. According to Keil, the student board typically spends between $2,500 and $3,000 on each trip.
“All of this was possible because Dean Khurana really wanted there to be more interesting social options for first-year students,” Steele said.
Last year, then-First-Year Fellow Torey E. Martin recruited members of the Class of 2019 as organizers and dubbed the reformed program “Into the Hub”—the “hub” referring to the city of Boston. Into the Hub’s student board planned activities for their freshmen peers, usually available to over 50 students rather than the 10 to 15 students on a given Through the Gates outing. With new funding, the trips are entirely free.
In its inaugural year, the program struggled to fill events. However, Keil and the program’s freshman representatives have pushed to publicize the program more widely this academic year.
“We’ve definitely increased publicity. We’ve made a big push on Facebook, over the 2020 events email list, and I think the biggest thing has been the posters in Annenberg,” Keil said.
The push has proved effective: while the first event for the class of 2020, a Red Sox game, took a few hours to fill up, sign-ups for the program’s laser tag outing received so much traffic that the server crashed within three minutes, according to Keil. The website was relaunched several hours later and, within a few minutes, was filled and waitlisted.
The Into the Hub student board has organized a diverse set of activities, ranging from Boston Red Sox and Celtics games to laser tag and trampoline park excursions.
In the largest outing of the year, the Into the Hub program rented a movie theater for a showing of "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them." Approximately 140 students attended, according to Laura Chapman ’20. and the popularity of activity-based outings prompted a shift in the programming for second semester.
Chapman said these activity-based trips have been conducive to meeting new freshmen on the trips themselves, which is more in line with the mission of Into the Hub. Additionally, increased funding this semester has allowed for more frequent outings that provide more consistent social opportunities for freshmen.
“Our leader, Marie Keil… got us some more money this semester, so we’ve been more aggressive about scheduling trips,” Chapman said. “Last semester we were hitting once or twice a month, and this semester it’s been more like three or four times a month.”
With trip sign-ups sometimes closing within minutes and frequent waitlists, Chapman hopes that increased funding will allow Into the Hub to grow in scope in the years to come. “Most of our trips fill up pretty quickly, so there’s clearly a lot of people who want to be doing this,” Chapman said. “With more money and more board members to take the lead on organizing trips, these trips could happen more often.”
Although it is too soon to quantitatively measure the impact of the Into the Hub program on the freshman class, Into the Hub has received positive feedback from student surveys and individual conversations with students.
“It’s still in the early days, but qualitatively all of our board members have reported really positive feedback from their friends, we’ve had a lot of people say ‘I would have been sitting alone in my dorm on Friday night if not for this,’” Keil said.
Gunnar Plunkett ’20 has attended all but two of the Into the Hub trips this year, often organizing with a group of friends beforehand. “Usually they send out an email saying that sign ups are tonight, so then I set a reminder on my phone for about five minutes before the deadline,” Plunkett said. “Then for those whole five minutes I’m basically just refreshing the page.”
Striking a balance between existing friend groups and individual students wanting to meet new friends has quickly become one of the major considerations of the Into the Hub board.
“I think that’s something that we’ve been wrestling with a little bit, of how to get that balance right,” Chapman said. “Are we just entertaining friend groups, or is this really an opportunity to meet new people? Ideally, it would be both.”
Some students view Into the Hub as a means of introducing different friend groups while meeting others on the trip itself.
“I would watch for the emails like a hawk, and recommend it to all my roommates and all my friends,” Victoria Márquez ’20 said. “Oftentimes, you have a lot of different friend groups who don’t know each other, so I think this would be a cool way to get them all together.”
In addition to bringing together different groups, Kevin Gordon ’20 said that the change of scenery encouraged individual students to better connect with the people around them.
“I would suggest it to most of my friends, if not all of them,” he said. “I think, by changing the environment, it helps change the person as well and allow them to grow and get to know the other people around them.”
Asked to sum up his experience with Into the Hub this year, Plunkett said: “I don’t think my first year would be the same if I hadn’t done Into the Hub.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When scanning through the Harvard track and field schedule, a three-day, mid-season meet in Philadelphia doesn’t exactly jump off the page. The team has already made trips to Kentucky, New Mexico, Washington, Arkansas, and Florida, and will compete at Heps next weekend before ECACs, Regionals, and Outdoor Championships.
A six-hour trip to the City of Brotherly Love seems like a small drop in a big bucket. But make no mistake about it—the Penn Relays is not just another track meet. The five-day meet is the nation’s oldest and largest and will bring together middle schoolers and masters, Olympians from Kingston and amateurs from Kensington, first timers and athletes who have been competing since they were eligible (fourth grade). For the Crimson, nine athletes will be taking to 122-year-old, 52,958-seat Franklin Field for this historic event.
“Penn Relays has been a crazy inspirational environment—athletes come from all over the world to compete,” said junior pole vaulter Marlee Sabatino. “Our outdoor season always seem to fly by, but I’m stoked to have this last opportunity to jump before Ivies, harness all the energy and excitement, and go big.”
Sabatino, who is coming off a fifth-place finish at last weekend’s Cardinal Classic, and Nicole Trenchard will be the first Harvard athletes to participate in this year’s Penn Relays as their event kicks off at 10:05 Thursday morning. Junior distance runners Elianna Shwayder (5,000-meter) and Fiona Davis (10,000-meter) will run their respective races under the lights on Thursday evening while junior Tyler Spear and sophomore Collin Price will race in the night’s final event—the men’s 10,000-meter.
Anthony DeNitto is the only Harvard freshman making the trip to Philadelphia as the Waban, Mass., native will be representing the Crimson in the men’s long jump competition on Friday afternoon. Senior Efe Uwaifo and sophomore Ian West will be competing on Saturday afternoon, in the triple jump and pole vault championships, respectively. Uwaifo finished third in the triple jump last weekend at Stanford. West took part in the Penn Relays as a senior at Fike High School in Wilson, N.C.
“Anytime you get to represent Harvard is just an honor from an individual standpoint,” West said. “Those of us who are competing are really dialed in, putting ourselves in a championship mentality and knowing this is the time to be serious, this is the time that big time players are going to make big time plays. We’re very focused in the opportunities that are presented to us.”
The Penn Relays is as much a part of the social fabric of Philadelphia as cheesesteaks, the Liberty Bell, and spring weekends on the Schuylkill River.
It is truly the pinnacle of track and field in the city. The event was founded as a carnival and still maintains that feel to this day. Youth track coaches take their teams after practice to watch the races on Thursday night.
High schoolers cut class on Friday afternoon to take in their classmates’ races and college relays. Spectators lay out in green spaces around Franklin Field while athletes stretch and go for warm-up runs. University City’s famous food trucks cater to local business people, fans, and athletes alike, with lines winding down the one-way streets.
For some schools, athletes, and families, the long weekend is a holiday in and of itself. Megan McCloskey, a junior high jumper for Penn State from Lower Gwynedd, Pa., will be participating in her 12th Penn Relays on Saturday.
She made her debut as a fourth grader for St. Alphonsus School. Her older sister, Kiernan, a former Lehigh basketball player, took part eight times, while the sisters’ younger brother, Kyle, a Villanova-bound football player, will run for Germantown Academy’s 4x400-meter relay team on Friday, in what will be his fifth go-round at Franklin Field.
Each day of the meet, three of which will feature Harvard athletes, has its own special flavor to it. Tuesday is the kick-off for the five-day event while Wednesday features the college men’s and women’s decathalons in the morning.
Thursday is all about the girls at Franklin Field.The day begins at 10 a.m. with the 400-meter hurdles and concludes with the 10,000-meter men’s race, which starts at 11:05 p.m., one of only two events featuring men on the day. In addition to 18 field events, there are 107 track races on the day, including 34 heats in the high school 4x400-meter category.
Local bragging rights are on the line as the top runners from Philadelphia’s Catholic and Public Leagues as well as from the Pennsylvania suburbs and Camden compete for the bronze plaques that are awarded to the winners.The night features a full slate of distance races, with diehards staying in the haunted bleachers well after sundown. Highlights include the high school and college distance medley championships.
Friday has a bit of everything. College hurdles kick off the day at 9:00 a.m. with grade school races leading up to the women’s 4x100-meter championship at 1:00 p.m. College and masters men’s races highlight the afternoon while sprint and distance medley relays are in primetime on Friday night. There are 15 different field events on the day.
The carnival concludes on Saturday as some of the event’s highest-profile athletes take center stage. High school boys’ races take up the bulk of the morning and serve as appetizers for the men’s and women’s USA vs. the World 4x100, sprint medley, and 4x400 races.
Uwaifo and West will be in the infield competing as some of the world’s fastest runners compete in USA vs. the World.These six races consist of relay teams from the United States going up against some of the world’s fastest sprinters. Usain Bolt and Allyson Felix are just two of the many Olympians and world champions to have run in a USA vs. the World race.
“I place a high premium on history, on almost even showmanship,” West said. “I’m incredibly excited about it and nothing is lost to me in regards to the history and importance of this meet. I’m very excited to have a stadium full of people, an experience you’ll never have otherwise.”
The 123rd running of the Penn Relays will have an added twist. The NFL Draft, which is being held in Philadelphia for the first time on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, will shut down the city’s Ben Franklin Parkway for the weekend.
As the Cleveland Browns are making their second round draft pick Friday night, the men’s masters 4x400-meter relay will be taking place a mere 1.6 miles away. Over 300,000 visitors are expected to be in town for the two major events this weekend.
While few football fans will have a hard time deciding where to turn their attention, the logistical nightmare will come for the brave souls trying to go anywhere remotely near downtown. Public transportation and hotels will be more packed than a Wawa at two in the morning. Just ask the Miami Marlins. The team, in town for a three-game set with the Phillies, had to stay in Wilmington, Del., after the NFL booked all of Philadelphia’s luxury hotels.
While ESPN will have its cameras on Center City for the first time, runners, jumpers, throwers, and track fans everywhere will be glued to one of Philadelphia and the track community’s favorite pastimes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard softball stormed into Providence, R.I. last weekend, leaving with three victories and outscoring Brown by a combined tally of 16-6. The second contest of the series was postponed due to rain, and since the game had significant playoff implications for the North Division crown, it had to be made up at a later date.
The Crimson (18-17, 9-7 Ivy) once again traveled down to Brown, this time to complete the four-game series against the Bears (14-27, 4-12). Four days removed from the dominance it displayed last weekend, however, Harvard struggled to carry its momentum into this midweek matchup. The Bears used two strong offensive innings and a solid outing on the mound to defeat the Crimson, 4-0.
“Today wasn’t the result we wanted, but I think it opened our eyes a little bit,” sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “Nothing comes easy and we need to fight even harder for this North Division title.”
The first three innings did not feature any scoring, but they were not devoid of offensive threats. Harvard senior righthander Taylor Cabe and Brown’s Gina Chieffallo essentially matched each other out-for-out, but each had to work out of some jams along the way. Through three frames, Cabe had scattered four singles and struck out three. Chieffallo allowed seven baserunners, but none of them crossed the plate.
After the three-inning stalemate, two big innings for the Bears’ bats downed Harvard. Senior catcher Julia Schoenewald launched a two-run dinger in the bottom of the fourth to put Brown on the board.
The following inning, back-to-back singles from third baseman Cat Seitz and designated player Meghan Wimmer plated two more to give the Bears a 4-0 advantage.
Two more shut-down innings from Brown starter Gina Chieffallo were enough to hold the 4-0 lead and secure the shutout victory. Chieffallo allowed doubles to sophomore center fielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer and sophomore third baseman Erin Lockhart in the sixth and seventh innings, respectively, but she avoided the scoring threat each time.
“We strung some hits together, but none were timely so we were unable to be productive at the plate,” Rich said.
Chieffallo capped off her complete-game outing by inducing a groundout to second base. The senior did not completely stymie the Crimson’s hitters, but she worked out of several tight spots throughout her start.
“I think she did a good job of keeping the ball away from our hitters,” Schiffhauer said.
Both teams put 11 runners on base, but the Bears’ timely hitting and Harvard’s lack thereof was key. In six of its seven trips to the plate, the Crimson left at least one runner in scoring position.
“I think we hit into a lot of outs and sometimes reached for balls that weren’t necessarily in our zone,” Schiffhauer said. “We definitely had some hard shots that they made good plays on, but we have to do a better job making in-game adjustments and having more timely hitting.”
One inning in particular that came back to haunt Harvard was the top of the second.
After Harvard’s first two hitters recorded quick outs on popups to the second baseman, junior second baseman Melissa Lacro singled. Lacro’s base hit marked the Crimson’s first hit of the afternoon. Schiffhauer quickly followed with a single of her own into left field, and junior left fielder Dallas Hogan drew a walk to load up the bases. However, a ground ball to shortstop and a force out at second base killed the scoring chance.
The loss puts Harvard one game back of North Division leader Dartmouth heading into a four-game weekend set with the Big Green. The situation for the Crimson is exactly the same as in 2016, when it took three of four games on the final weekend of the season to earn a berth in the Ivy League Championship Series.
“Obviously a win today could have put us in a better position and we all know that,” Rich said. “But the first thing we said after the game today to each other was that this game doesn’t define us as a team. We’re focusing on our Dartmouth series now and what we need to do to be successful against them.”
“We did it last year so we know we can do it again this year,” Rich added.

Classes are finally over and formal season is here to let us live before the impending doom of finals. As formals are classier than regular parties but still sloppy and awkward, we’re here to help you navigate the confusing week of legendary nights you won’t remember.
Bring a date
The easiest way to get a date is to just ask. Seriously, you don’t have to stage an elaborate promposal involving serenades or HUPD—just put those famed Harvard networking skills to use and shoot them a text to hang out. Also, as you’re probably bad at dealing with rejection, just chill out if they say no. Shockingly, you don’t have to pretend they’re dead to you when you see them around.
Look fly on a budget
If you’re not willing to drop some serious cash on formal wear (imagine how many Felipe’s burritos you could buy instead!), there are plenty of low-cost options around. For those of you who are into dresses, Amazon has many nice styles that won’t put a dent into your latte budget. If you're looking for a suit, wear your consulting interview blazer (we know you have one). Alternatively, shop around—you have hundreds of other wardrobes right in your building. If all fails, you can always loosely interpret “black tie suggested” and come in whatever—Securitas does not double as the fashion police (sadly).
Pregame
First of all, don’t get too lit. There is a reason we don’t have formals in fancy hotel ballrooms anymore (thanks Class of 2017 for not letting us have nice things), so don’t yak so badly that the next year formals will be held in Lamont. Also, if you really want to make the night (un)memorable, sneak your drinks underneath your clothes as your clutches and bags will be checked.
Crash a formal
Nobody knows why formal tickets are so pricy nowadays (are tents, fairy lights and mediocre DJs that expensive?). Shmooze a HoCo chair and find out how people are marked at the entrance then draw an X on your hand or tie a ribbon and pretend you left to go to the bathroom. Or just down a few for courage and sneak up from behind. And don’t forget to laugh at the fools who bought their tickets late off the email list for 50 bucks.
So have fun but don’t make a fool of yourself and remember that you can try again next semester if you finally get the courage to ask that Eliot cutie to Fete ;)
