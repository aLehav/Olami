After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks before the end of August, I was on the bus back to New Jersey, stoic as hell. Summer felt like a body, tight. Air was wet, made the trees black. Didn’t know it before, but life has a pace to it. I’d planned on moving through it all like life, people and classes and feelings and music and winter. I kept thinking about freshman fall. Last September, I thought, you keep looking backwards, you won’t move forwards. I took transition hard, the way most people do. I was post-existential, sharp. I was going to take my life like a bad boy and make it work for me because I could. I thought I succeeded until I didn’t because being alone, this place, made me soft in ways I didn’t know I could be. I spent so much of freshman year thinking of home I doubted I could recognize it when I came back. I dreamt so much that year I felt it in my chest.
This summer I kept thinking about growing up. I went to the MoMA and watched Maggie Lee’s "Mommy," her autobiographical video in multiple parts. Lee also grew up in suburban New Jersey, yellow. I kept remembering her story’s colors, the neons, her long thick hair, the words she chose like “think” and “circus” and “daddy’s little girl.” I kept wondering which colors I’d pick, which moments. In what ways could I, like Lee, convey a life, show I was done but not over it, make each aspect as obviously falsifiable as I knew it to be, but breathless, intoxicating, cool.
I think all girls know what girlhood’s supposed to look like, regardless of how far from it they are. My version was tween-skinny, virginal. First cigs on your eighteenth birthday; flings, far and faded like a drug. I was supposed to Abramovic my life, because even then, I knew life was all about how you imagined it. Once a girl a year above me showed me a poem she wrote. She wanted to know how drunk felt like so she locked herself in her room with her parents’ beer in hand. Sipped but wasn’t too dizzy, wasn’t even buzzed. Ended up storing the can under her bed. I kept wondering if it was all true, because I felt the seduction, the click of the lock. We wanted cities bad. We were suburban and bored and we wanted Manhattan lights and thigh-highs and walks at three and noise, jazz, glitz. We were all getting the hell out because we were too dramatic or too smart or too soulful or too alternative for our little New Jersey town with nothing to do but that Starbucks on the corner or boys we’d been bored of for three years already.
Looking back, we were good at it, the language of girling, because we were dreaming it, not living it. A friend of mine loved writing about straddling fences, football fields at midnight, and I bought it, even if I knew she spent most nights doing homework til two in the morning. The girls in her stories wore floral dresses. The wires dug into their panties.
I remember home like girlhood, because maybe it was. What if home was nothing but longing? To me, New Jersey was the most beautiful place in the world, and I had proof, because the bounciest song on "Miseducation" was “Every Ghetto, Every City,” an ode to what Lauryn Hill called New Jerusalem. Junot Diaz wouldn’t ever stop loving this place and naming his stories “Edison, New Jersey” and keeping his characters in Paterson. In Boston, I missed being acknowledged, and in New Jersey, the people looked you in the eye.
But maybe it was all in my head. I came back and it rained, colored things. Maybe this is New Jersey, and maybe this is life. Things are gorgeous if they’re yours, dull if they aren’t. Home isn’t the boxes in it, nor even the people. It’s the place that grew with you, that formed you before you formed it. My home was suburban, quiet, and green. I thought I could invent and reinvent myself like a phoenix, because I was from a nowhere, where everything that was valuable was implicit, soft-spoken, something you knew only if you lived it.
I read an article about white girlhood, this carefreeness, sunset-through-a-filter-ness, this sad-but-not-too-sad flimsiness. The article said that not everyone could aspire to white girlhood. Not everyone had the privilege to be flimsy and carefree and pretty and angsty, so we had to stop discussing femininity as if it was the same for everyone. The article was right, and I’d never imagined myself as white, but I hadn’t realized my girlhood fit perfectly into that trope. Looking back, it didn’t. I was a homework bitch. I played the piano. I went to Science Olympiad. I never left my house much. But I was imagining a world in which I was white inside.
A friend from home visited Cambridge last October. When the kid left, I couldn’t stop writing. I kept thinking about places, what the little parts of them meant. In New York, the roads are grids, and intersections are expected, common, and if you don’t like one direction, you can flip and turn; the opposite is right. You can have a system. You can make it to the cross of 34th and Avenue of the Americas only passing through 31st once. But here, in Cambridge, you walk and the road turns. You stop by Eliot Street and wonder if it’s the same one you’d passed twenty minutes ago. There are five ways to make it somewhere, more ways to get lost, and one decision to make: If you’ll keep your feet stepping one in front of another, or if you’ll turn back. Chances are, you’ll still end in the same place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the September air crispens and the days begin to shorten, I await my second winter in the New England with equal parts relief and excitement. Relief, because my roommates and I will no longer depend on an elaborate system of strategically-placed fans to prevent our AC-less anachronism of a dormitory from becoming a veritable inferno. Excitement, however, for reasons that are much more complex, and nearer and dearer to my heart.
For some reason, I have always been inordinately fond of snowfall and the cold. I revel in the austere winter aesthetic of bare trees and gray skies, and can raptly watch snow fall for hours.
Alas, before I moved to the Northeast for college, I lived the majority of my life in the Piedmont of North Carolina, a land of underwhelming winters. Annual snowfall is measured in inches instead of feet. I have regularly sported shorts and a t-shirt in January, and occasionally even sweated. The mere prospect of anything more than an inconsequential dusting precipitates general disarray, with panicked shoppers emptying market shelves of necessaries like milk and eggs, and schools canceling classes left and right. Snow typically melts into puddles within 24 hours of landing—leaving me with a feeling of emptiness on the inside.
When I decided to attend Harvard late in the characteristically mild North Carolinian winter of 2014, I thought the hibernal tides would finally turn in my favor. The Northeastern winter of epic proportions that had been recently bestowed upon Harvard only raised my expectations. I had read about a record-setting 108.6 inches of snow, including 65 inches of snowfall in just February, and about gargantuan blizzards dropping two feet of snow and forcing Harvard to cancel school on multiple occasions. I had begun to salivate for an encore—the Northeastern winter would surely deliver, once graced by my presence—only this time I would live it in person rather than vicariously.
The winter of my freshman year, however, was an utter disgrace. Cambridge did not see a single snowflake before winter break. Boston averaged a temperature of roughly 37 degrees over the season, making it the second warmest winter recorded in Boston history. Contrary to my hopes, school was never cancelled, and the biggest blizzard of the season narrowly missed the area, coming tantalizingly close. I had anticipated a winter wonderland, but for some reason winter decided to turn a cold shoulder to Cambridge. I felt personally offended by the travesty of a winter.
Nevertheless, the lackluster winter caused me to realize that the forces that control the weather lie outside of my control, and they are coldly indifferent to my desires and whims. It was highly solipsistic for me to expect that my presence would somehow metaphysically alter the laws of nature, and even more so for me to take the warm weather as a personal slight. The unlacquered truth is that nature has neither friends nor foes.
Admittedly, it is no great revelation that I do not exercise some sort of telekinetic control over the weather. Nevertheless, it is all too easy to fall into such logical pitfalls, especially given our inherent egotism as human beings. In the ironic words of David Foster Wallace, “everybody is identical in their secret unspoken belief that way deep down they are different from everyone else.” Though this egocentrism goes unnoticed when we function on autopilot—it may even be salutary under normal circumstances—it can be stretched to absurd and even comedic ends if we are not careful.
And as a newly admitted and matriculated Harvard freshman, it was all too easy for me to succumb to this kind of self-centeredness. I was one of the select few that had made it through the admissions bottleneck, so the stars were supposed to obligingly align in my favor, right? My unfulfilled expectations for the winter of my freshman year served as the most distinct example of the shoddiness of this logic.
But it doesn’t make sense to renounce all hope simply because I can have no expectations. Despite my disappointment last year, I anticipate my three remaining winters at Harvard with glee—if I am especially lucky, the vagaries of nature and my desires may just coincide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months after University President Drew G. Faust’s controversial decision to impose sanctions on undergraduate members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, the University is taking its first concrete steps toward implementing this policy with the creation of a Single-Gender Social Organizations Policy Implementation Committee. This committee, according to its website, will work to “[guide] the implementation of the College’s recent policy change”.
Members of the committee—who have not yet been finalized—will include students, faculty, and staff alike. Undergraduate representatives will be selected through an open nomination and selection process guided by input from the Undergraduate Council. We commend University administration for striving to include undergraduates in this historic process. It is important to note, however, that the open nomination process will be merely symbolic if the selected students do not bring a diverse set of opinions and experiences.
The open nomination process will certainly allow for breadth of prospective undergraduate committee members. But apart from the Undergraduate Council's involvement, there are no safeguards in place to ensure that student members of the committee will reflect the opinions of the undergraduate student body as a whole. If the undergraduate representatives themselves do not encompass the diversity Harvard itself has worked so diligently to craft, the committee will inevitably fail to consider the different attitudes students currently have towards the sanctions.
The potential consequences of diversity—or homogeny—go beyond the abstract affirmation of Harvard’s core liberal value of diversity. A homogenous committee would be an undemocratic distortion of reality. It cannot be denied that the  campus reaction to the prospective sanctions has been mixed, with perspectives  running the gamut from passionate support to indignant opposition. Multiple opinions must be represented in order for the rest of the committee and University administration to understand the different sentiments students harbor.
Membership selection aside, we would appreciate more transparency regarding the sanctions as a whole. The lack of open discussion before the policy was unveiled is at odds with the University’s efforts to have an open nomination process. At times, the discourse has degraded to disconcerting levels of vagueness. For example, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana precisely outlined this sweeping policy this past May, yet his most recent letter to undergraduate students announcing the creation of this committee appears to invite more candid discussion about the sanctions before the policy is set in stone, and goes so far as to suggest that specific planks of the policy—such as the affected leadership roles—are still in flux.  Though this softened rhetoric may seem innocuous, it may mislead students, giving them the idea that they may actually have a voice in shaping the policy when administrators have already decided their course of action.

The world’s leading political scientists, top newspapers, and esteemed voters of Harvard College know that this year’s election will be one to remember. A zany cast of characters defines this unprecedented political season. Meanwhile, Harvard undergraduates will soon eagerly cast their ballots to determine this year’s president of the Undergraduate Council. FM imagines what the UC campaigns would look like if the current presidential candidates were on the ballot.
Gary E. Johnson:
Gary Johnson’s libertarian candidacy began with high hopes. With backing from those alienated by the more mainstream candidates, Johnson capitalized on disillusionment among College students with his alternative campaign. However, Johnson has been treading rough waters as a result of his disastrous interview with The Harvard Crimson. When asked his opinion on the Porcellian’s “open” punch, he infamously made a gaffe by replying “[w]hat is the Porcellian?” His campaign has not recovered since.
Jill E. Stein:
Jill Stein’s candidacy was seen early on as the spiritual successor to the failed campaign of popular upperclassman Bernie Sanders, but her campaign has struggled to pick up where the Bern left off. Hailing from Winthrop swing housing, Stein started off with a fractured base of support. She ran into further trouble after joining a protest regarding HUDS workers' compensation, which ended with her graffitiing the John Harvard statue—an act of protest that was recorded on video and sent to HUPD. There is currently a warrant out for her arrest.
Hillary R. Clinton: 
Clinton easily boasts the most impressive resume of this year’s set of candidates: In high school, she was on the student council and led her Model UN team... to a disastrous loss against Libya. (She even dated the class president.) Despite this past record of success, one of the more significant clefts in Clinton’s historic campaign has been the controversy surrounding her Harvard email account. She’s received backlash from all sides for allegedly attempting to delete 30,000 Harambe-related emails that she had sent to the Class of 2020 mailing list. Clinton and her top advisers—including former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds—claim that she was simply trying to inform the freshman class about her policy measures. Her opponents, aiming to have her reviewed by the Ad Board, have leveled accusations that these actions constitute a breach of the Harvard Honor Code. Hillary’s health has also come into question during the past month, as several eyewitnesses have reported her numerous trips to Harvard University Health Services. Despite speculation by many Trump fans that she has contracted the mumps, Clinton claims that it’s just pneumonia.
Donald J. Trump:

The Pluralism Project, an organization that researches religious diversity in the United States, celebrated its 25th anniversary last week with three days of panels and discussions.
In 1991, Diana L. Eck, a professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies, and 25 students in her course set out to document the religious diversity of Greater Boston. These initial efforts led Eck to found the Pluralism Project, which has continued to explore religion across the country for the past 25 years.
To mark the milestone, the Pluralism Project organized a conference, which included a student panel, and discussions with Pluralism Project alumni who have continued to pursue work in the field. The conference brought together scholars and interfaith leaders to reflect on the past, present, and future of religious dialogue and diversity.
In an interview, Eck said the Pluralism Project seeks to gather and disseminate research that helps Americans better understand different religious communities in the United States and their interactions. Through its research, the organization also seeks to better define religious pluralism.
Rather than a being a synonym for religious tolerance, Eck said she views pluralism as “being able to engage with diversity.”
“It is premised on dialogue, on the give and take, the traffic of people talking about things,” she said.
Looking ahead, Eck said she hopes to empower another generation of researchers to take the initiative in new directions.
The Pluralism Project has developed case studies on issues of religious diversity, and Eck said they are an important part of the group’s teaching effort. Eck uses many of them in her General Education course, United States in the World 32: “The World’s Religions in Multicultural America: Case Studies in Religious Pluralism.” She said she hopes to further promote the case study method in teaching religious studies in the coming years.
One of the student panelists at last week’s conference, Halah Y. Ahmad ’17, a former summer research intern with the Pluralism Project, called the course’s case studies “key resources for interfaith religious knowledge-building.” Now president of the Harvard Islamic Society, Ahmad worked on mapping minority neighborhoods in her hometown of Milwaukee, Wis.
The Pluralism Project is also considering developing an online course about the religious diversity of America to reach many universities and students, and to “teach America through the lens of its Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Mormon, Islamic, Jain, Hindu, Sikh, Native people communities,” according to Eck.

The 35th Undergraduate Council got off to a contentious start, as its routine weekly grants pack stirred an intense debate over the Finance Committee’s proposed funding allocations during the body’s first meeting.
This week’s grants pack, proposed by UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, who was absent at Sunday night’s meeting, originally allocated $13,934 to be distributed across more than 30 student organizations. Representatives of student organizations who submitted grant requests for this week were interviewed last Wednesday during the Finance Committee’s weekly meeting.
 
During the Sunday deliberation, several representatives raised concerns over the legislation’s grant of $2,107.04 to retroactively fund TEDxHarvardCollege’s most recent event. Some representatives raised questions about the group’s worthiness to receive funding.
“Almost 10 percent [of our weekly budget] went to publicity for a TEDx conference that I didn't even know was happening. How can we justify spending almost 10 percent of our weekly budget?” Eliot House representative Taylor D. Marquis ’18 said.
UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 also pointed out that—when considering whether to grant groups official recognition—the administrators evaluate whether student organizations are “without obligation to any parent organization, national chapter, or charter," according to the College's online handbook.
Dunster House representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 proposed an amendment to the grants pack which would strike the funding from TEDxHarvardCollege for this week so that the Council could “audit” the funding allocation and reassess the grant later.
“This isn't saying we're not going to fund them,” Agbafe said. “It says: let's take some times, let's deliberate over the merits of us funding this.”
The Council voted to adopt Agbafe’s amendment, and the grants pack with Agbafe’s amendment passed with near unanimous consent.
During the beginning of the meeting, three undergraduate representatives from Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement presented information to the Council about the University’s recent labor negotiations with Harvard University Dining Services.
Later this week, SLAM will present to the UC’s Rules Committee, after which the committee will determine whether the UC is allowed constitutionally to consider endorsing a potential HUDS strike. If the committee rules that the UC may consider the proposal, then the full Council will vote on the endorsement during a future meeting, according to UC President Shaiba Rather ’17.
Banks also announced that the Council, in partnership with Harvard Student Agencies, will be adding deals for local businesses in Harvard Square to Omni—a mobile application launched last year that currently provides shuttle tracking services and a dining hall menu, among other features.
Rather announced during the meeting that Cabot House representative Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 will take over as Rules Committee Chair from former Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, and that Cabot House representative Catherine L. Zhang ’19 will serve as the Council’s new Freshman Class Committee Chair.

Instead of the usual peanuts and baseball fans, on Saturday afternoon Fenway Park was filled with flocks of local college students attracted by the live music and free giveaways of CollegeFest 2016.
With a light fall breeze stirring in the air, students traversed the ballpark with brand-marked bags in tow to collect goodies from a variety of organizations marketing themselves to attendees—ranging from Zipcar to the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. The stage situated in between vendors hosted various musicians playing music that ranged from indie rock to a capella.
Students at the event could spin wheels or download mobile applications to get promotional swag or free food samples. Many walked away from the event with both stomachs and bags full.
A handful of Harvard students attended the event, which also attracted students from schools all over the Boston area, including Simmons College, Emmanuel College, Boston University, and Northeastern University.
According to Paul Tedeschi, chief executive officer and founder of the Campus Agency, the company that operates CollegeFest, the annual event serves two primary purposes: It gives vendors an opportunity to market their products and services to college students in creative ways, and gives local students an afternoon to meet other students, play games, and gather free gear.
CollegeFest originated in the mid-1980s when it was hosted at the Commonwealth Armory, he said. After later moving to the Hynes Convention Center, the event has called Fenway Park home for the past few years.
After charging admission for many years to cover the costs of headlining artists, the event is now free for all students as vendors are becoming the primary source of entertainment, Tedeschi said.
One of the sponsors present at the event was the company Swag'r, which runs a mobile app that uses geolocation technology to connect users with targeted deals. Company founder Greg William said that he and his team were at CollegeFest to generate buzz around their product, and hoped to have over 5,000 downloads by the end of the day.
Campus Agency has expanded CollegeFest beyond Boston to other locations including the DCU Center in Worcester and an additional location in Philadelphia, according to Tedeschi.
He said the agency hopes to eventually partner with the City of Boston to turn the event into a “welcome weekend” for students in the area, starting with CollegeFest and then offering events throughout the weekend to get students to explore the city.

Harvard’s admission rate soared this Saturday—at least at the Harvard Art Museums.
The Harvard Art Museums participated in the Smithsonian magazine’s Museum Day Live! event, a nationwide festival hosted by the Smithsonian magazine every year. Participating museums offer free admission to visitors who bring an official Museum Day Live! ticket.
“It’s a tradition that museums have,” Sanja Cvjeticanin, director of visitor services at the Harvard Art Museums, said. “We want to reach out to people who normally wouldn’t come to the museum and engage them with what we do here.”
The museum sees around 800 visitors on a typical Saturday, but on Museum Day, around 1,000 showed up, Cvjeticanin said. This statistic only captures gallery attendance and not courtyard and café visitation, which is more difficult to estimate.
The Harvard Art Museums underwent six years of renovations and reopened to the public in November of 2014. The renovation combined three museums—the Fogg, the Arthur M. Sackler, and the Busch-Reisinger—under one roof.
Cvjeticanin said the museum did not arrange any special programming for Museum Day Live!
“The opening two years ago took so much preparation that all other events seems small in comparison,” she said.
Museum Day provided free admission for many visitors, but Harvard students and Cambridge residents did not have to worry about printing out an official ticket to get in for free. Normally, admission is $15 for adults, but about half of the Museums’ visitors—Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents—can attend for free, according to Cvjeticanin.
During the day, many visitors relaxed and enjoyed coffee in the courtyard, while others explored the gallery. Many guests said they found out about the event through social media and were excited to take advantage of the opportunity.
“For some people this might be the one day a year they come,” Cvjeticanin said.
Wenjun Di, a fourth year Ph.D student from Northeastern University, said she heard about the event two days in advance via Twitter.
“I emailed my coworkers about the event. It’s a great opportunity, and I’ve never had a chance to go,” she said.

UPDATED: Oct. 3 2016, at 3:06 p.m.
A debate between Harvard and its dining workers over a new contract deepened when four Harvard Medical School students penned an analysis denouncing the health benefits package the University proposed to HUDS workers in June, at the start of negotiations.
HUDS workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike should the University not comply with their demands, which include increased salaries and more affordable health care benefits. Their contract expired on Sept. 17, but the two parties will continue bargaining; their last scheduled meeting is Tuesday.
During a bargaining session on Sept. 16, the four Medical School students presented a four-page analysis of Harvard’s initial health care proposal, calling it “unaffordable under state government guidelines.” Under Massachusetts health connector guidelines, a plan is considered "unaffordable" if "the lowest-cost plan that coversonly the employee costs less than 9.66% of [the] household’s income," according to its website.
Harvard put forth a plan identical to the one negotiated by its largest employee union. That plan eliminates deductibles, increases copayments, and introduces a new premium tier based on salary.
The analysis argues that Harvard’s plan “may threaten the financial security of many families of Harvard employees,” regardless of premium tiers intended to protect lower-paid employees. In addition, the Medical School students argue that workers would be better off without health insurance from Harvard entirely, because in that case they would qualify for the subsidized health insurance on the state insurance exchange.
Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga challenged their analysis, writing in a statement that the document “takes the worst-case scenario under the Harvard plan and compares it to a best-case scenario in Mass. Health.”
The analysis uses a hypothetical worker with a salary of $30,000 and a family of three as an example to compare how much an individual would pay in premiums through Harvard’s plan and what they would pay if they were enrolled in a given state plan. The students argue that, under Harvard’s plan, the worker could pay as much as $233 a month in premiums for family coverage versus $0 through the Massachusetts plan.
The average HUDS worker makes approximately $34,000 in annual salary, according to deLuzuriaga;  HUDS workers do not typically work year round. And, in some cases, deLuzuriaga wrote, workers would actually pay more for premiums under the state plan.
Harvard takes an individual’s annual income into account when selecting which benefits package to provide, while MassHealth considers family income. According to deLuzuriaga, in 2016 the lowest premium tier for an individual under Harvard’s plan is $91 per month, and premiums for families cost $246.
91The Medical School analysis and subsequent University refutation both deepens and underscores an increasingly polarized debate between Harvard and its students. Groups of activists across the University, including at the Law School, the College, and the Medical School, have each publicized their support of HUDS’s willingness to strike.
Some students from the Racial Justice Coalition at the Medical School participated in the recent talks between the University and its workers. Students also organized a “Social Justice Summit” several weeks ago to outline goals for diversity within the school, and they specifically discussed the HUDS negotiations at their event. In addition, a few weeks ago, nearly 100 Medical and Dental school students rallied at Longwood’s iconic Gordon Hall in support of the workers.
The Medical students’ analysis also criticized Harvard’s reimbursement program—in which workers must keep and turn in receipts for procedures—though deLuzuriaga disputed the numbers students presented. Their analysis argues that, under the proposed health plan, workers would be reimbursed if their copayments exceed $1,025 for an individual or $2,000 for a family. DeLuzuriaga wrote, though, that the “co-pay reimbursement” threshold for individuals is $480 while the threshold for families is $890.
Several Medical students involved with the issue said they felt a personal responsibility to support HUDS workers because the issue revolves around health care.
Analysis co-author and Medical student Rahul Nayak said, “As Med students, we were concerned about the health implications that this would have on the workers.”
Although HUDS workers are typically associated with undergraduate dining halls, some workers staff a cafe in Longwood.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: October 3 
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the lowest premium tier for an individual in Harvard's 2016 health benefits plan is $91 per year. In fact, it is $91 per month.

Hundreds of Harvard students and faculty members ran together Sunday afternoon—not to class or the library—but as participants in the 13th annual Brian Honan 5K Run/Walk.
The three-mile race, which took place in Allston, celebrates the legacy of Brian J. Honan, a former Boston city councilor representing Allston and Brighton, who passed away in 2002 after a battle with cancer.
Honan’s brother, Massachusetts state representative Kevin G. Honan, said the race was “a huge success.”
“It’s a wonderful way to keep my brother Brian’s memory alive, and we’re very grateful to everyone who participates and comes and runs and walks,” he said. “It’s a real partnership between long-term residents from the neighborhood, newer people, and college students.”
Harvard, which sent 205 registered runners out of approximately 1,300 total, finished first among registered teams, with many top-10 finishers. With 54 runners, the Harvard Business School cohort finished third overall. With top finishers, Harvard won the Brian J. Honan Cup overall for the 13th year in a row, according to Kevin Honan.
Proceeds from the race will go to the Brian J. Honan Charitable Fund to continue the late Honan’s dedication to education, housing, and healthcare for local communities, Kevin Honan said.
The streets surrounding the course were packed with residents who cheered runners on and vendors who used the event as an opportunity to promote their products. The Allston Village Street Fair took place near the race as well, adding to the lively environment.
Attendees included Boston’s Mayor Martin J. Walsh and Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans.
Harvard participants ranged from first-time 5K runners to members of the Harvard College Running Club and Harvard College Marathon Challenge.
Harvard’s Public Affairs and Communications Office paid for Harvard students’ and employees’ registration fees as a way to help support the cause.
“Brian Honan was a great advocate and friend to both Harvard and the Allston-Brighton community and we are proud to continue to help honor his extraordinary legacy,” Brigid O’Rourke, a Harvard spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement.
Michael S. Kincaid, an economics student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, finished fourth overall. He said that participating in running activities at Harvard has been a great way to meet people and have time away from problem sets.
Ryan E. Ixtlahuac ’20, who finished third in the race, agreed.
“It was just really cool to see the community come together to run for somebody and it was fun to race,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a team trails for most of the game after allowing an early goal, it can often be difficult to break down tough, gritty opponents that choose to park the bus and protect the lead late in the game. But most teams aren’t the Harvard men’s soccer team (3-3-1). With less than nine minutes left in the game, and down 1-0, it seemed like the Iona (1-7-0) would pull out its second win of the season-- a win it would need to keep up momentum upon starting conference play on Tuesday. But a relentless Harvard offense found a way to find the back of the net -- not once, but twice, to give win the game 2-1.
With just three minutes left in the game, senior forward Jake Freeman fed a ball through Iona’s defense to junior midfielder Christian Sady, who slid the ball in near post to put Harvard up 2-1 and clinch the win.
“It was definitely a battle today,” senior defender Alex Leondis said. “Both of our goals came pretty late. That just shows that the team doesn’t quit or stop fighting…. Today was an especially big one, we needed it. Hopefully the momentum continues. Everyone worked so hard today, and we needed it. It was a good team win.”
The Crimson stepped onto Mazzella Field in New Rochelle, NY., eager to bounce back from a pair of losses and gain momentum heading into Ivy League play.
The game got off to a shaky start for Harvard, though, as Iona’s Teddy Forson fed a ball through the Crimson defense, which forward Daniel Huertas picked up and chipped over junior goalkeeper Kyle Parks in just under eight minutes to put the Gaels up 1-0. The team did not capitalize on the early advantage, though, as Harvard’s defense solidified to allow only two more shots in the rest of the first half.
Offensively, the Crimson was unable to get the equalizer, for as much as Iona’s offense was unable to gain momentum and find more chances, its defense was determined to thwart any of Harvard’s attempts on goal. Harvard did find itself in its attacking third several times-- racking up eight corner kicks in the first half-- but was not able to capitalize on the set pieces. It ultimately had to settle for just three shots on goal.
In the second half, the Crimson came out strong, with the defense shutting out Iona, and the offense beginning to break down Iona’s defense. The team outshot Iona, 10-4, and had more shots on goal, but were unlucky in finding the back of Iona’s net for the majority of the game.
With less than nine minutes left to play, Harvard stepped up its intensity. Co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu connected with Leondis off a deflected cross, and Leonis found a way to do what Harvard been trying to do for the past 81 minutes: get the ball past Iona’s goalkeeper, Kellar Sirstins.
“We were pushing in the second half, we were getting a lot of chances, and eventually everyone was just battling,” Leondis said. “It felt great to get the goal. It felt great to get one as a team because I thought we deserved one.”
At this point, many would be content to go shore up its defense to force the game into overtime, which would allow time to reset and prepare for another chance to win the game. But in true Harvard fashion, the offense did not let up, even with the clock ticking down.
Six minutes after Leonis tied up the game, Freeman teed up Sady for the game winning goal.
“Obviously we’re really happy with the result,” senior defender Dan Smith said. “But I think even more significantly is something we’ve been saying the whole season, that we’re a team that fights, even when the result isn’t going our way. We’re a team that fights for each other and grinds for 90 minutes, and today we were really rewarded for that.”
These goals were the first of the season for both Leonis and Sady. With so many players stepping up and contributing to both offense and defense, Harvard has proven that it has what it takes to get through gritty games and come out on top.
“We’ve always been a program that is proud of demanding that everyone step up and contribute, from freshmen to seniors, and I think we’re seeing that so clearly this year. It feels good and we’re going to keep doing that."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team entered its bout with Dartmouth on Friday with neither history nor momentum on its side. The Crimson had lost its last two Ivy League openers to the Big Green in disappointing fashion, while Harvard this season had struggled out of the gate, picking up only two wins in its first nine games; Dartmouth, meanwhile, had notched six wins in 10 contests.
But the Crimson left Hanover, N.H., with something that Dartmouth has yet to obtain: a 2016 Ivy League victory.
For the first time since 2013, Harvard (3-7, 1-0 Ivy) commenced its Ancient Eight slate with a win over the Big Green (6-5, 0-1) in Leede Arena in straight-set fashion (6-5, 0-1).
“I think it was a really good start to our Ivy League run, especially winning in three,” junior Paige Kebe said. “We could set a standard early of being the dominant team in the league and just to show the Ivy teams that we’re the ones to beat.”
The Big Green opened up play by stringing together six straight points, four of which came on attacking errors. Freshman Maclaine Fields was able to stop the run temporarily with a kill for the first point of the game for the Crimson, but Dartmouth managed to retain a five-point lead for a large portion of the set, pushing the score to 17-12.
But just as it looked as if Dartmouth was on track to hand the Crimson its third-straight Ivy League loss, three Dartmouth errors combined with a kill from freshman Grace Roberts Burbank and an ace from classmate Erin McCarthy tied the match up at 17 apiece. After trading jabs, the Big Green had a chance to take the set, up 25-24, but a service error from co-captain Emily Astarita knotted the game at 25 all. From there, the Crimson took over the reigns—freshman Isabelle Tashima registered an ace, while sophomore Christina Cornelius capped off the set with her third kill of the set.
“I was really happy with our team’s focus and composure, especially under pressure,” Kebe said. “In the first game, it was very close and we all stayed pretty calm and were able to execute.”
After taking the second set with relative ease, the Crimson found itself down early in the third set, trailing 6-2 after four errors. That lead would not last long into the set, as Harvard pulled together a 13-5 run led by three kills from Burbank, one of several freshmen who had an impact during the contest.
“I think the transition to the team has been super, super easy,” Fields said. “That’s because when we came in, we went on a retreat and immediately  [the upperclassmen] just embraced us…. At a lot of places, that doesn’t happen all the time.”
The final set was a game of runs, as Dartmouth made one fast final push to force another set with a 7-1 charge, edging out to a two-point advantage, 18-16. The game would remain within a few points until the waning moments of the match. Tied at 22 points, two Big Green errors and a Dartmouth kill put Harvard within a point of victory. From there, the three-time All-Ivy First Team member in Bain took matters into her own hands, taking an assist from McCarthy and powering an attack over the net to end the match.
Leading the team in total attacks, Kebe provided an offensive spark for Harvard, recording an efficient 11 kills in the winning effort. Three players—Fields, Cornelius, and Burbank—all finished with 7 each.
The Crimson was able to shut down Astarita—an All-Ivy First Team member—as the senior finished with only nine kills paired with four errors on 28 total attacks. It was Sara Lindquist who led the Big Green in kills.
“I think our coaches did a really good job of effectively scouting her,” Kebe said. “One of our goals was to shut her down. I think we did that effectively.”
Harvard’s win was also very much a defensive effort as well. Cornelius and Bain made their presence known at the net, each recording four blocks. Tashima also recorded 10 digs in her Ivy League debut as the team’s starting libero.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a pair of matchups that featured the first Ancient Eight game of the year and a clash against a ranked team, the Harvard field hockey team left the Berylson Family Field Hockey Field with a pair of victories under its belt after defeating Yale (4-4, 0-1 Ivy) and #19 Maine (7-3, 0-0 America East).
The wins snapped a three game losing streak and brought the Crimson (4-4, 1-0 Ivy) back to .500 going into the heart of the season.
HARVARD 3, #19 MAINE 1
The Crimson capped-off a perfect weekend nearly blanking the 19th ranked Maine Black Bears on Sunday afternoon. The win moved the Crimson to 4-1 at home and dropped the Black Bears to 2-2 away.
“Playing a top-20 team, especially a team that we really struggled with last year, coming out after the win against Yale we didn’t know what to expect,” said Harvard coach Tjerk van Hewaarden. “The way we showed up and were able to get the win is well deserved with good hockey. I’m very excited by how the season is shaping up so far.”
Freshman forward Maddie Earle netted the Crimson’s first goal in the 20th minute, assisted by Harvard captain Marissa Balleza’s centering pass. Balleza scored one of her own in the 39th minute, hammering home sophomore forward Kathleen Young’s rebounded shot.
The freshman Bente van Vlijem continued her strong play, launching a firecracker from the top of the circle in the 44th minute to put Harvard on top 3-0. Hailing from Zeist, Netherlands, van Vlijem is averaging a point per game in six appearances.
“I’m a freshman, so this has been a huge transition,” said van Vlijem. “We’ve made huge progress since our first few games. Our opponents were really good that last two games, and we just crushed them. The team atmosphere is really good, and we have a lot of fun on the field, and I think that’s the most important part. Maine is a really good team, so we had to keep that focus we had in our last game. It was hard in the beginning, but we kept on going and it was really good.”
Maine spoiled Harvard’s back-to-back shutout bid with two minutes to play when Canadian captain Danielle Aviani slipped one past sophomore goalkeeper Libby Manela for the final score.
HARVARD 2, YALE 0
At a rowdy Harvard Field Hockey Stadium, the Crimson women took center-stage in the first Harvard-Yale matchup of the year, snapping a three-game skid with a 2-0 win over the rival Bulldogs on Friday night and opening its slate of Ivy League games with a victory.
The Crimson wasted no time drawing first blood, as van Vlijmen caught Yale sleeping only 31 seconds into the game. Young intercepted a lazy Bulldog pass, quickly moving it to a streaking  van Vlijem, who dribbled through multiple defenders before firing a backhand laser into the bottom left corner past a diving Yale netminder Emilie Katz, who stopped 10 shots overall.
“We had a great start with the goal in 31 seconds, and then it became a typical Ivy League game,” said van Herwaarden.” Every single ball is fought for, and it becomes a matter of who wants to put in the most work. Yale is a well-coached team—very dangerous, and I’m very happy we were able to keep the clean sheet. I know we have the potential to do very well in the Ivy League.”
Earle narrowly missed off the post moments before van Vlijem struck again in the 26th minute off a penalty corner redirection assisted by junior midfielder Ellie Cookson and senior midfielder Kyla Cordrey.
“It was so exciting,” Balleza said. “We always get really pumped, and the team definitely brings in a different energy heading into Ivies…One thing we’ve struggled with in the past has been consistency, so hopefully in the future we’ll just keep doing that.”
The Crimson pitched its first shutout of the season, as Manela’s first career start in goal couldn’t have gone any smoother—throwing in an impressive 49th minute table-top save as the highlight of her performance.
Harvard dictated possession throughout the night holding the Bulldogs to just one shot, and none in the second half. The Crimson notched 18 shots overall–12 on goal–and drew 14 penalty corners to Yale’s zero. The Bulldogs’ back line was under siege wire-to-wire, as Harvard’s first Ivy League contest concluded in dominating fashion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a windy Friday night Harvard looked to avenge last year’s Ivy League semifinal loss against Brown and claim its first win on newly inaugurated Mignone Field. On the opposite side of the ball, the Bears were aiming for a comeback win after suffering a blowout defeat to defending Ivy League champion Dartmouth on Sept. 17. The matchup pitted two of the Ancient Eight’s most prominent rugby teams against each other, leaving only one on top.
The Crimson (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) won in emphatic fashion, 45-15, against the Bears (0-2, 0-2 Ivy), putting the game away early and getting off to its best start in program history.
“I think we showed tonight that when things aren’t going perfectly well for us, we have the ability to score and rally and regroup,” Crimson coach Sue Parker said. “But also that when we are under pressure, we have some areas to improve on.”
Harvard spread around its scoring, as eight different players contributed tries to the winning effort. The spread was in part the result of long strings of passes to widen the field. The Crimson took advantage of the scrums that drew Brown defenders into one location and then distributed the ball to the edge players.
After an opening penalty kick, freshman Robyn Beese scored Harvard’s first try of the evening, set up by a driving run from senior captain Claire Collins to put the Crimson up 8-0. Two more tries by sophomore Rachel Harkavy and freshman Delia Hellander quickly placed Harvard into a commanding position that they would hold for the rest of the night.
Hellander’s drive into the end zone including juking five defenders, capping an 18-0 start for the Crimson. The team is building up from the bottom with youth and the rookies are starting to play a larger role on the team.
“They are unbelievable,” Parker said. “The freshman class—tons of personality. They aren’t afraid of working hard, they are not afraid of putting themselves out on the field. They have tremendous athleticism and it’s a joy to see them improving every single day.”
Brown played spoiler in the final minute of the period with a penalty kick to break a shutout streak that lasted around 160 minutes and dating back to the first half of the Navy season-opener.
Freshman Dominique Cantave continued Harvard’s run by scoring the first try of her collegiate career. Sophomore Jenny Kronish added her own try to make it 40-3.
Brown then responded with two tries late in the second half. The Crimson was never in danger, but the Bears capitalized on Harvard’s lack of focus.
“I think that we took a game plan that we only had worked on for a week and did it well, but we only did that for a very short portion of the game,” junior captain Maya Learned said. “The score would have been a lot higher if we had done more of the game plan.”
Some of the sour taste was swept away by sophomore Caitlin Weigel, who went on a 60 yard run to cap off the victory for the Crimson.
During every score the crowd erupted in loud cheers from the stands overlooking Mignone Field. But this was the first year with this atmosphere.
“Amazing,” Parker said. “You can hear it. I mean, it was so fun playing here. It was so inspirational to have the support of all these fans. Roberto [Mignone], who couldn’t be here tonight because he’s running an ultramarathon,…is with us in spirit and we are with him in spirit. It’s not just the field. It’s actually him and his support of these programs that fuels us.”
Friday’s match-up was the first of consecutive conference games Harvard will undertake, with the team facing off against Dartmouth next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend at the Ivy Plus Tournament, the strategy for the Harvard men’s tennis team was to divide and conquer. Four players traveled to Princeton, N.J., while five made the trek to Philadelphia, Pa. to compete in the tournament co-hosted by Penn and Princeton.
With players taking on seven matches throughout the three-day event, the team had several standout performances in the first Ivy League play of the season.
“We got a lot of matches in, got to work more on our game plan and tactics,” senior Brian Yeung said. “Everyone looked more comfortable in matches and even during pressured conditions.”
Penn
Returning to the courts after battling an injury last spring, junior Grant Solomon upset Bryant freshman and number one seed Matt Kuhar before advancing to the final at Penn. After dropping the first set of his first two matches, the Texas native managed to come back both times.
“I really had to dig in mentally and physically,” Solomon said. “But just enjoying being healthy after last season and coming back strong was rewarding in itself, and I’m honestly just thrilled to be healthy and to have been able to have been clutch in the key moments.”
Solomon has yet to drop a three set match all year. Although he lost in straight sets in the final contest of the first singles flight, he made it to the semifinals of his doubles match.
Fellow junior and Texas native Xavier Gonzalez also had a strong showing, making it to the semifinals in the third singles flight. Gonzalez came out on top in two close three-set matches this weekend, only falling to Penn State sophomore Zach Lieb.
Besides offering a sheer volume of matches, the tournament also provided valuable experience for the freshmen on the team. Rookie Galen Lee, who struggled to close out the win last weekend at the Chowder Fest, took home two victories in the consolation matches of his flight. Lee’s victories included a 6-1, 6-2 sweep of his Penn opponent.
“The freshmen had their first matches away from home and performed well,” Solomon said. “We all competed well against both the other Ivies and schools out of conference.”
Princeton
At the Lenz Tennis Center in Princeton, the Crimson came out on top in doubles, ending the weekend with a 5-1 record. The duo of Yeung and sophomore Michael Peters proved unstoppable on the doubles courts, as the pair earned three consecutive wins and edged out its Dartmouth opponents 8-7 in the final.
“Michael and I got to play a lot of doubles last week, got to know each other’s style more,” Yeung said. “So we played much better as a doubles pair this week.”
Junior Kenny Tao and co-captain Jean Thirouin also made it to the finals of their doubles draw, sweeping their Tennessee and South Carolina opponents. However, the pair ultimately lost to a Buffalo duo in the finals.
“It was a heavy weekend of tennis, but what stood out was our doubles results,” Thirouin said.
On the singles side, Thirouin earned a 3-1 finish, losing once in the tiebreaker of a three-set nailbiter. Tao had only one loss this weekend as well, finishing 2-1 with a loss in a three-set tiebreaker.
Meanwhile freshman Logan Weber added a win to his belt, ousting his Penn opponent 7-5, 6-4.
“Overall, it was a really good weekend in terms of building towards our goals this year,” Thirouin said. “We’ve been working a lot on strengthening our doubles with individual players showing big improvements in singles too.”
With each player logging four singles matches and three doubles matches in the second high-volume weekend in a row, team chemistry and support were critical to keeping the players going.
“For sure Olive Garden was what kept us going,” Thirouin said. “But on a more serious note, we all get along so well and have so much fun on these trips that motivation isn’t ever an issue. We cheer each other on when we’re not on court and just try to keep the energy high throughout.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the third weekend of competition for the Harvard sailing team, the Crimson continually placed around the middle of the pack in four events. Ivy League rival Yale placed ahead of Harvard in each event, even finishing first in one of the regattas. Despite placing lower its rival, the Crimson says it came away with many positives from the weekend.
“This was our first weekend this fall with heavy breeze and very powered-up boats,” junior crew Kevin Coakley said. “Getting experience in those conditions will be helpful in coming weeks and allowed us to showcase our versatility. We have a young team and have a considerable amount of work to do before the fall championships, but weekends like this one are encouraging.”
NEW ENGLAND SINGLEHANDED CHAMPIONSHIPS
Racing in lasers at the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association Conference Championships hosted by Connecticut College, Harvard looked to replicate its success from a year ago.
In 2015, then-sophomore Juan Carlos Perdomo won the men’s championship by scoring 65 points, 10 points ahead of his nearest competitor. On the women’s side, then-sophomore Taylor Ladd earned a fifth-place finish after scoring 40 points.
The top five finishers in the men and women’s competitions qualify for nationals, meaning Perdomo and Ladd both qualified for the big stage with their performances last season.
This time around, in the men’s competition, sophomore skipper Andrew Puopolo finished 13th out of 23 competitors, scoring 180 points.
“It was a pretty tough event; we were sailing in lasers which aren’t sailed too often in college sailing,” Puopolo said. “I thought it was a pretty tough event against some really good people from around New England. I didn’t do as well as I probably would have liked, but it was definitely a good learning experience for next year and going forward.”
Tufts’s Alp Rodopman won the competition with a score of 44. The Yale duo of Nicholas Baird and Malcolm Lamphere, Boston College’s Scott Rasmussen, and Roger Williams’s Martim Anderson rounded out the top five and thus qualified for nationals.
In the women’s competition, which featured 15 competitors, freshman skippers Sophia Marie Mascia and Jessica Williams finished eighth and 13th with scores of 97 and 133, respectively, racing radials. Boston College’s Erika Reineke won the event with a score of 28, beating out her nearest competitor by 23. Brown’s Lindsey Baab, Coast Guard’s Dana Rohde, BC’s Isabella Loosbrock, and Yale’s Louisa Nordstrom also qualified for nationals.
PROFESSOR STEDMAN HOOD TROPHY
In the 34th annual running of the interconference Hood Trophy regatta hosted by Tufts University, the Crimson recorded its best finish of the weekend, coming in sixth out of 19 teams with a total score of 195.
Of the Ivy league teams present, Harvard placed behind Yale, who finished fourth with 180 points, but edged out Dartmouth, Brown, and Cornell by 16, 98, and 126 points, respectively.
In the Crimson’s A division, swapping crew duties for junior co-captain Nick Sertl, Coakley and sophomore crew Christine Gosioco posted a score of 101, finishing sixth. In the B division, represented by sophomores Jackson Wagner and Catherine Tang on Saturday and sophomore skipper Nick DiGiovanni and senior crew Julia Lord on Sunday, Harvard posted a score of 94 and also finishing sixth.
AMANDA TROPHY
At the helm of FJs, the Crimson finished 12th out of 15 in the in-conference regatta hosted by Roger Williams University. Harvard was edged out by fellow Ivy league competitors Brown, Dartmouth, and champion Yale by 16, 42, and 85 points, respectively.
Freshman skipper Lucy Wilmot and sophomore crew Divya Arya represented the Crimson in the A division, posting 87 points. The B team, composed of skipper Catherine Kerner and sophomore crew Alejandra Resendiz, logged a score of 80.
CHRIS LODER TROPHY
For the Chris Loder Trophy, hosted by MIT, sailors raced in 420s along the Charles River Basin. After not competing in the event last year, Harvard finished 9th in an 18-team pack this year with 194 points after losing a tiebreaker to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
In the A division, sophomore skipper Nick Karnovsky and sophomore crew Lena Episalla finished fourth with a low score of 79. In the B division, skipper Victoria Marquez and senior crew Cara Kennedy Cuomo had a bit more trouble, finishing with a score of 115.
Tufts won the event with 123 points. Ivy leaguers Yale and Dartmouth finished second and fourth with 130 and 158 points, respectively. Last year’s champion Boston University finished seventh with 185 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing on the road against a young but talented Penn squad, the Harvard women’s soccer team entered Saturday’s game hoping to notch a win in its Ivy League opener. The Crimson came into the matchup on a three-game win streak, while the Quakers had even more momentum thanks to a five-game unbeaten run.
Something had to give, and after a hard-fought game in which both sides had their chances, Harvard (6-3-0, 1-0-0 Ivy) triumphed over Penn (4-2-1, 0-1-0) by a narrow final margin of 1-0.
Senior forward Midge Purce scored the only goal of the match in the 29th minute from the penalty spot after a Quakers foul in the box during a corner kick. It was Purce’s eighth tally of the season and 38th of her career, moving her into sole possession of third place on the all-time school scoring list.
Penn suffered just its second Ivy League loss at home since 2010. Over that 20-game span, its only other loss also came at the hands of the Crimson, back in the 2014 campaign. This season, the Quakers had only dropped one game before facing Harvard—against Maryland in late August.
“The Ivy League brings with it a lot of energy and emotion,” Crimson coach Chris Hamblin said. “[Penn is] a pretty good team at home, and for us to get that result means an awful lot. I’m really proud of the team effort.”
Harvard certainly showed its energy to start the contest, creating several good scoring chances in the first half. The team put shots on frame in the 18th, 25th, and 27th minutes, but each time Penn freshman goalkeeper Kitty Qu stymied the effort. Despite not capitalizing on these opportunities, the Crimson had the upper hand throughout the first few phases of the match.
The pressure finally produced results after Harvard earned two corners in three minutes midway through the first half. Between the two set pieces, the visitors also challenged Qu with a dangerous ball into the box. However, sophomore midfielder Zayne Matulis could only direct it right at Qu, forcing a save.
It was during the scramble following the second corner, as the Quakers continued to try to control the Crimson’s attack, that the referee handed Harvard a clear-cut chance with a penalty kick. Purce put it away to Qu’s left, boosting her team to a 1-0 lead.
“Although it would have been great to put another one in for a small cushion, I’m really happy with the way we created those chances,” Hamblin said. “Although we were unable to take them, we put ourselves in good positions.”
On the other side of the field, the Crimson’s veteran defense absorbed Penn’s physical attack well, matching its aggressive play and allowing just three shots on goal. Senior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack directed the defense and earned the shutout, the 11th of her career and second of the year.
“They were a very athletic team, a very dynamic team,” Durack said. “To hold them off for the whole game is a credit to our strength and the quality of our defending.”
Harvard’s offense deserved just as much credit as the defense for shutting out the Quakers, as it kept the Quakers under pressure and didn’t give them space or time to operate. The team as a whole moved effectively to negate scoring chances before they materialized.
“We wanted to make sure that we were being smart about our positioning and keeping our team shape such that we didn’t allow any individuals to expose us,” Hamblin said. “But we’ve got to continue to work on creating those attacking opportunities and taking advantage of them.”
Even so—even if the Crimson does have to capitalize on more of its chances to win future games—Purce’s one goal off the penalty was enough to seal the victory on Saturday.
“Penn is a good team,” Durack said. “Coming off a win against a good team is very confidence-building.”

Playing the second event of its fall slate of competition, the Harvard men’s golf squad made a northern trek to Quechee, Vt. There, the Crimson took part in a weekend tournament hosted by fellow Ivy League member Dartmouth.
After two rounds of play over two days, the Crimson walked away in second place out of a field of 15 teams, finishing behind only Rhode Island.
“I like the result, and I like where the team appears to be going,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Every player is sharpening his game week to week, and everyone is focusing on all the right things that will makes their skill progression come along nicely.”
The invite took place at the Lakeland Course at the Quechee Club. The 6,671-yard course played at a par 72 for the weekend. Of the course’s 18 holes, 17 of them feature water in play. The course is comprised of five par-three holes as well as five par-fives.
Harvard’s round one score of 287 positioned the team in the third slot, one stroke behind Penn and eight off the pace of Rhode Island. However, Harvard was able to fire a 293 on Sunday, the lowest score for any team in round two. This allowed the Crimson to overtake the Quakers and move within two shots of Rhode Island.
Penn’s 305 in round two dropped the Quakers to fourth place overall at plus-15.
The tournament featured six of the eight Ancient Eight schools, as Cornell, Columbia, and Brown joined Penn, Harvard, and the hosts from Dartmouth on the course. The second through fifth place spots were all occupied by Ivy League competitors, as Cornell, Penn, and Columbia, respectively, finished immediately behind Harvard.
“The result we came away with isn’t important because we were up against other Ivy League teams,” Harvard junior Greg Royston said. “The important thing was the thought process and how we were approaching the event on the course, so that will give us confidence going forward.”
The Big Red’s round two 295 moved Cornell three sports up the leaderboard Sunday, eight strokes behind Harvard.
Temple, Hartford, Colgate, Siena College, Fordham, Central Connecticut, and Holy Cross also traveled to the event. Dartmouth fielded two teams over the weekend.
Overall, team scores were up on Sunday as compared to Saturday, with only Dartmouth, Fordham, and Holy Cross improving upon their round one shot totals.
“We were able to handle some adverse conditions pretty well over the last two days and really do our jobs,” Rhoads said. “We had to deal with some pretty fast greens, some aerified greens, and some really, really strong wind gusts during the course of play, so I’m happy with the outcome.”
On the individual side of play, senior Robert Deng led the way for the Crimson. Deng, playing the tournament exclusively as an individual, finished tied for third overall among 84 entrants. The senior’s 70 on Sunday moved him 13 spots up the leaderboard, leaving him behind only Chris Houston and Billy Walthouse, both hailing from Rhode Island.
Royston and sophomore Seiya Liu, also competing as an individual, concluded play as part of tie for fifth place at even par. They were joined by Columbia’s Joshua Suh. Freshman Rij Patel wrapped up the event one stroke behind Royston and Liu at plus-one, earning him a portion of seventh place. Senior Kendrick Vinar was also a part of this six-player tie.
“Every week when we set out to qualify for the team, there’s never a situation where we know going in who will be selected,” Royston said. “On a week to week basis, any player on the team can step onto the scoring team and play well, which speaks volumes about the depth of the program.”

September is coming to a close, meaning three important things for freshman on campus: winter is coming, Annenberg food is losing its quantitative appeal (its only appeal), and midterms are a real thing.
We’ve now entered the awkward in-between following the opening weeks during which we’re surrounded by a flurry of parties celebrating the start of college and filled with friendly faces, but preceding a time of security and routine when we will actually know what we’re doing for the rest of the semester. These weeks are reserved for long days filled with uncertainty of schedules, the shock of having homework, and – God forbid – actually being challenged by a class. And what better time than now to introduce yet another horror?
So, here’s to all the freshmen who have never studied a day in their lives, who always got by in high school with intelligence and lazy indifference, and who are scared by the reality of an actual exam. Follow these simple tips, in addition to common sense, in order to not fail your first Harvard midterm:
Here’s a simple one: don’t cheat. We know, we know, the odds that someone else has studied harder than you for this exam is high. And that guy in the row in front of you looks like he hasn’t slept in weeks, meaning he definitely knows how to do the problem you’ve been staring at for hours. But trust us, it’s not worth it. #RIPGov1310
Wear sweatpants. We know you still harbor hopes of finding love on this campus (you won’t), but it’s not worth the pain. You wake up an hour early, shower, wear your sexiest outfit, and show up ready to impress. You look good, smell good, and you should be turning heads. But you’re not, because everyone is focused on their cramming and testing. Instead, you got one less hour of sleep, you’re starting to get cold, and you haven’t even seen the cute person you were trying to impress. Option two? Go for the sweatpants, get an extra hour of sleep, be warm and comfortable, and focus that brilliant mind on the test.
Get some sleep, and don't overdo it on the caffeine. Also, trying black coffee in an effort to seem legit is not a good idea on the day of your first exam. There seems to be a sadistic culture around some circles at Harvard, in which the perception of how smart you are — or how many insanely hard classes you’re taking — is directly proportional to how much coffee you down the night before. I’m here with the Crimson to bring you breaking news: it’s not. Begin studying well before the exam, by a couple days or even a week, and then get a good night’s sleep the night before. Your mind and body will thank you.

You know it's time to say good-bye to the summer when Starbucks starts advertising its seasonal Pumpkin Spice Latte. And while you may be hesitant to pack up your swimsuit and sandals till next May, we're here to tell you that fall can be just as fun—if not more so—than summer ever was. Here are a few things you have to look forward to as we dive into #sweaterweather.
Apple PickingWhat could be more wholesome than a Saturday afternoon spent with friends at the local orchard? The Brooksby Farm and Belkin Family Lookout Farm are two of many orchards near Boston that offer pick-your-own apples on weekends. If you're thinking, why go to an orchard when I can get free apples at the d-halls, just note that these farms have adorable barn animals as well as freshly baked pies, homemade fudge, and cider doughnuts (seriously, who could turn down all that?).
Fall FashionThis season, the best time to wear a striped sweater really is all the time. With fall comes the onslaught of jewel tones, riding boots, and plaid. So. Much. Plaid. Exchange the shorts for long pants and relish in this moment when you can feel comfortable outside in only a light sweater. Walking through campus when all of the leaves around you begin to turn a school-spirited crimson is an incredible feeling. Just wait till late October when the leaves happen to match the color of the word "Harvard" embroidered on all of your college gear (think about it, your outfit will color coordinate with...the world. It's an Instagram opportunity worth waiting an entire year for).
Scented CandlesNow available in a whole range of scents, from spiced orange and cinnamon to pumpkin pie, replace the smells of a hot summer (namely sweat) with something straight from Grandma's kitchen. These technically aren't allowed in dorm rooms, but we won't tell anyone if you don't.
Reasonable Dorm Temperatures (without the fan!)Fall means no more suffocating nights in your dorm room. Leave the windows open for fresh crisp air that will make staying in your room to work on a pset or a paper much more enjoyable.
It's been said that autumn is the most beautiful season of the year here at Harvard. So whatever you end up doing this fall, make sure to get out of Lamont from time to time, take a deep breath, and enjoy the scenery. The season doesn't last long, and Winter Is Coming.
