After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SOUTH BEND, Ind.—One week ahead of their scheduled Dec. 5 bout at Houston Field House in New York, the men’s hockey teams from Harvard and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will get their first look at each other in the championship game of Notre Dame’s Shillelagh Tournament Saturday afternoon at 4:05 p.m.
The two ECAC heavyweights skate into the final after earning 4-1 wins in Friday’s opening round. RPI (8-4-2, 4-0-2) extended its unbeaten streak to nine games with its drubbing of Western Michigan in the first matchup of the day, while Harvard (5-1-1, 4-1-1) capitalized on nine Notre Dame penalties to knock off the hosts in the nightcap.
While the final of the holiday tournament will not count towards the ECAC standings, Saturday might not be the last time the two sides play for a trophy. Despite its predicted 10th place finish in both the preseason coaches’ and media polls, the Engineers have taken the ECAC by storm thus far in 2015, riding wins over Yale and St. Lawrence to the top of the leaderboard alongside unbeaten Quinnipiac.
The RPI offense starts with junior forward Riley Bourbonnais, who is tied for second in the ECAC with eight goals on the year. The Rochester, N.Y., native also ranks third in the ECAC in points—tied with Harvard’s Jimmy Vesey (13).
Bourbonnais is joined by sophomore Viktor Liljegren and senior Milos Bubela on the first line, the latter of whom returned to the lineup only recently after missing five games with a shoulder injury. Bubela ranks first among all active RPI skaters in goals and points with 22 and 47, respectively.
While the return of the veteran forward has helped solidify the Engineer first line, the loss of a rookie has left a hole further down the lineup. Earlier this week, second-line center Evan Tironese, who opened the year with seven points in seven games, was ruled out for the season.The ECAC Rookie of the Month in October took a hit from behind earlier in the season, and after being labeled day-to-day for a few weeks, RPI coach Seth Appert recently confirmed that Tironese’s rookie campaign has concluded.
Nonetheless, the depth of Appert’s squad has enabled the Engineers to beat the injury bug. Twelve different players have recorded five or more points thus far in 2015.
On Saturday, the well-rounded RPI attack will look to hand Crimson sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen his first loss. Madsen, who now boasts a 4-0-0 record after his 29-save performance against Notre Dame Friday night, in all likelihood will get the start in net again as Harvard looks to add a trophy to its cabinet.
Madsen kept the Crimson in contention early on Friday, before a plethora of Notre Dame penalties allowed Harvard to pull away with three power-play goals. In order to stave off the Crimson, whose power-play unit ranks second in the nation, the Engineers will have to play more disciplined than usual, as RPI has racked up the most penalty minutes in the ECAC and eighth most in the country (14 per game).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 29, 2015, at 12:40 a.m.
SOUTH BEND, Ind.—With the Harvard and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute men’s hockey teams commanding two of the top three spots in the ECAC standings, a championship-deciding game between the two sides could be in the cards come March.
But Saturday afternoon it was South Bend, not Lake Placid, where the two sides squared off with a trophy on the line in the final of Notre Dame’s Shillelagh Tournament at Compton Family Ice Arena.
And in the battle of supposed ECAC heavyweights, only one side looked the part, as the Crimson offense fired away at will, launching a season-high 45 shots on goal en route to a 4-0 victory and its first Shillelagh title in school history.
“You only have so many opportunities to win something,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[Having] this tournament championship game was important even though it was against an opponent that we’ll see two more times…. They were as hot as almost anybody in the country coming in…[and] it got our guys’ attention.”
Much like it did here Friday night against Notre Dame, the Crimson spent much of the game on the man advantage—23 minutes in total. But unlike in its opener where Harvard converted on three power plays, the Crimson special teams unit came up empty, finishing 0-for-5 on the night.
But at even strength, Harvard could not be stopped. The Crimson’s first and second lines had their way with RPI, accounting for all four goals in the contest—including three in the second period.
After opening the middle frame with a one-goal advantage, the Crimson wasted no time adding to it. Less than two minutes into the period, junior forward Tyler Moy and freshman forward Ryan Donato helped wrestle the puck out from behind the net, setting up junior forward Luke Esposito at the right dot.
Just about as quickly as Donato’s pass reached the junior’s stick, the puck was in the back of the net, as Esposito’s rocket of a wrister beat freshman goaltender Cam Hackett to double the Crimson’s lead.
Six minutes later, Harvard’s Friday night hero—co-captain Kyle Criscuolo—tacked on his third goal of the weekend. Corralling the puck off a deflected Victor Newell blast from the point, the co-captain moved in all alone on Hackett and converted from the right post for the second time in as many nights.
Donato then gave the Crimson its fourth goal of the night from the bottom of the slot at 16:17. After faking a backhander to gain separation from his defender, Moy spun around to rip a wrister on net, which squirted in the direction of the rookie. Returning to his feet after getting knocked down seconds earlier, Donato put home the rebound, giving him his second point of the period after taking two penalties in the first.
“Being shorthanded twice in the first period wasn’t what we set out to do, and I definitely made mention of it to him,” Ted Donato said. “But he was working hard, and that line scored two big goals for us tonight.”
A four-goal lead was more than enough for Harvard sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen, who made 31 saves to secure his third clean sheet in five starts. Madsen cut out all of the chances he saw, including three consecutive shots on an RPI 5-on-3 midway through the third period.
“I thought Merrick was excellent,” Ted Donato said. “I thought he was in control all weekend. He was calm in the net, and made plays look simple. I think you can see his confidence growing.”
Madsen entered the season locked in a goaltending competition with rookie Michael Lackey, but with wins in three straight games, Madsen now appears to have cemented his role as the starter.
“There's obviously still things I've got to work on,” Madsen said. “I haven't been playing perfect games by any means, and there's things throughout the weeks and the rest of the year that I'm going to be continuing to work on. But obviously getting starts is what I'm looking for.”
The Acton, Calif., native finished the weekend with just one blemish and 60 saves, earning him tournament MVP honors. Madsen was joined by Criscuolo, Kerfoot, co-captain Jimmy Vesey, and Newell, the latter of whom entered the weekend with just three points in six games before recording three assists in the tournament, largely in part due to his new role as the point man on the power play.
The Engineers got out to a promising start in the first period, creating a handful of scoring opportunities on its two power plays. But the Crimson held its ground both times, finishing the game 5-for-5 on the penalty kill to improve its kill rate to 93 percent on the year—third-best in the country.
Five minutes after its final kill of the period, the Crimson opened the scoring in the same way it capped it on Friday—with a Vesey strike. Positioned behind the net, Criscuolo delivered a feed to Vesey crashing the net, and the Crimson’s leading scorer beat Cam Hackett at the top of the crease, providing Harvard with all the offense it would need.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Considering the magnitude of The Game, especially this year with Harvard chasing its third straight Ivy title, a standout performer on the football field against Yale was likely to take home Athlete of the Week honors. Justice Shelton-Moseley was the star to take advantage of the big stage, as he delivered several game-changing plays at the Yale Bowl on Saturday. Several other Crimson athletes had performances that were just as commendable, however, as they helped their respective teams secure strong finishes to their seasons.
Corie Bain, Kathleen Wallace and Christina Cornelius, Women’s Volleyball
14 games weren’t enough to separate Harvard and Princeton at the top of the Ivy standings, so it was up to each team’s star players to find separation in the winner-take-all playoff game. Harvard’s backbone of Bain, Wallace, and Cornelius, which has paced the team all season, delivered in a big way against the Tigers. Bain, who was just named to the All-Ivy First Team, tallied 15 kills en route to a dominating triple double performance. Wallace added 14 kills and nine digs, while Cornelius had nine kills and a solid .500 kill percentage. Riding the contributions of these three players, the Crimson secured their first NCAA tournament berth in school history.
Noah Harrison, Men’s Water Polo
Harrison made sure the last weekend of his collegiate career was one to be proud of, as he led the Crimson to a third-place finish at the CWPA Championship. In three games against Navy, No. 11 Princeton, and No. 10 Brown, Harrison tallied a total of 8 goals and 7 assists. His performances were punctuated by a 5-goal haul against Navy and 3 assists in a win over Brown. Harrison and his senior class finished their careers with the second most wins all time of any class in school history.
Ben Braunecker, Football
Braunecker was another senior who capped off his career with an outstanding performance, as he amassed 88 yards receiving against Yale. Two of his team-leading six catches were for touchdowns, and he played a crucial role as Harvard scored 31 unanswered points to take control of the game. Braunecker finished the season as the Crimson leader in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns.

Harvard-Yale brings out the best in Tweeters across campus every year, and the 2015 edition of the rivalry game certainly didn’t disappoint. Several of the usual random tidbits from Harvard athletes also made the cut in November’s final Tweets of the Week, giving us a peek into their adventures on the T and in the dentist’s office.
6. Kent Haeffner, sophomore, men’s swimming and diving
“@HarvardFootball just got an intentional grounding on a punt. Quality football on display at the Yale Bowl today #GoCrimson”
A possible submission for SportsCenter Not Top-10?
5. Molly Tissenbaum, junior, women’s ice hockey
“shoutout to the girl on the subway eating a pint of ice cream by herself #YouGoGirl #LifeGoals”
Some things can’t wait till you get home.
4. Renée Richardson Gosline, Harvard alum
“I just hollered so loudly at that last #Harvard TD, my dog ran and hid under the table. #sorrynotsorry #GoCrimson #TheGame”
…Just like the Bulldogs ran and hid when the Crimson rolled into New Haven
3. Marlee Ehrlich, women’s swimming and diving
“ "I can't feel my face when I'm with you"- lyric by The Weeknd and what I just said to the lady who is giving me novocaine for my root canal.”
We’re glad you’re finding a way to spice things up in the dentist’s office, Marlee. Most people would probably think more along the lines of “Cry Me a River” when they hear the words, “root canal.”
2. Sean Frazzette, senior, men’s rugby
“Saving writing an entire chapter of my thesis for the Sunday after Harvard-Yale is proving to be as dumb an idea as everyone told me it'd be”
I’m sure you weren’t the only one thinking this on the way back from New Haven, Sean. Harvard-Yale tends to do this to people.
1. Sean Malone, junior, men’s hockey
“Women all over our country are telling men to shave their beards. Join the fight against #beardoppression & help end this mindless injustice”
It’s just a matter of time before men find away to stretch No-Shave November into Don’t-Shave December. Let justice be served.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After getting its first victory over a Division I team, the Harvard men’s basketball team looks to win consecutive games for the first time all year when it travels to Holy Cross (2-3) Sunday. Staff writer David Freed has three things to watch as the Crimson kick off a month-long road trip.
1. The Other End — Through five games, a lot of the conversation has centered around the Harvard offense and the struggles of its point guard, freshman Tommy McCarthy. While the offense bounced back in a big way—shooting 55 percent and putting up 80 points, both season highs—against Bryant, the defense quietly shut down another opponent. For the fifth straight game, the Crimson held its opponent under 40 percent shooting. Defense has always been the calling card under head coach Tommy Amaker, with Harvard’s defense ranking ahead of its offense in three of the last four years in Ken Pomeroy’s rankings. This year, the Crimson’s offense is ranked 270th in the nation but its defense is 80th. Ahead of a pair of tough road contests against Northeastern and Kansas, Harvard will lean on its defense to bail out its offense when it inevitably stalls.
2. Falling Out of Favor — Before the year, it was fashionable to compare sophomore Andre Chatfield to Wesley Saunders ’15. Ivy Hoops Online wrote that Chatfield’s “progression seems very similar” to Saunders’, nothing that both had flashed some signs of greatness during spot duty their freshman years. But while Saunders broke out in a big way in his second season—finishing second in the Ivy League in scoring his sophomore year and leading the Crimson to a conference title—Chatfield’s path has been significantly rockier. The sophomore has fallen behind freshman Corey Johnson in the rotation and has made just one field goal all year, coming off the bench in every contest. With Harvard short on wings behind Johnson and senior Agunwa Okolie, Chatfield’s progress will be crucial for the Crimson going forward.
3. Taking Care of The Ball — Even in its best offensive game of the year, Harvard remained plagued by turnovers Tuesday against Bryant. The Crimson had 16 more giveaways against the Bulldogs, with four starters contributing two apiece. While Harvard shared the ball well—assisting on 22 of 28 made field goals—it was still outshot by Bryant despite giving up just nine offensive rebounds on 44 Bulldog misses. Coming into a game against Holy Cross—which forced 24 Crimson turnovers in its 58-57 upset a year ago—Harvard’s ball security will be extremely important.

What is it like?
It’s… Pretty empty. The campus, as you would expect, has been deserted. Tourist population has gone from 50% to 95%. It’s frightening, and companionship is hard to find.
Tour groups awed and gaped at the yard as usual. As I walked down the deserted hallways of Weld, I came to the realization that we have become the precious few remaining living, breathing Harvard students that tourists can actually photograph. Wonder if the tours tell them about today’s significance?
Is there anything to do?
This was definitely worth an investigation.
Upon suggestion, I tried to check out Freshman Dean’s Office, which was offering 50 free tickets to the Boston Symphony Orchestra, but I was too late. Boo. That was a dead end.
Nonetheless, this is Harvard, and we’re right next to Harvard Square. The one thing that I can always fall back on reliably is food. My friend and I ended up getting boba from the Boston Tea Stop and then I had a scorpion maki and salmon sashimi at Kaju Tofu & Shabu. Not bad.
In fact, it was inappropriately delectable.
And last of all, I got to catch up on a lot of sleep, work, and exercise. Plus, I finally got to watch The Social Network and The Theory of Everything after much anticipation. That really makes up for the fact that I couldn’t go to Harvard-Yale.
How do I feel about Yale?
Yuck Fale. Duh. Just because I wasn’t able to make it doesn’t mean I wasn’t aware of the HYpe going on in New Haven. I’m just cheering from afar, duh. For the ninth consecutive year, we showed Yale what it means to be the best school in the country. I hope they are ready for the tenth year because we’re just going to win that one as well.

Garrett M. Lam ’16 couldn’t contain his infectious grin as he recalled his Guinness World Record, longest time to balance on a Swiss ball, which he set in September to raise awareness for effective altruism.
Lam, a dual-concentrator in Neurobiology and Philosophy, spoke with us about his record-breaking feat less than a day after receiving news that he had been elected as a 2016 Rhodes Scholar. Lam smashed the previous Guinness World Record by more than 15 minutes on September 18th of this year, setting the new world-record bar at 5 hours, 25 minutes, and 36.98 seconds.
For Lam, his unique talent was a way to practice effective altruism, a school of thought which encourages the use of empirical evidence to better allocate resources to combat social issues. “For me, the ability that I seemed to have was, ‘I can stand on a ball for a long time.’ It’s kind of goofy,” Lam said, “But I thought that people might want to support me in this attempt.”
Lam encouraged friends, family, and associates to pledge charitable donations in support of his world record attempt, some pledging by the minute and others pledging in lump sums.
His inspiration for attempting the record, Lam believes, may have originated from childhood experiences playing with Swiss balls. One day, he tried to stand on one.
“My mom didn’t like that very much,” Lam said.
The almost 5-and-a-half-hour record was more than twice as long as any ball stand he had attempted before, and by the end of the attempt, Lam struggled to maintain focus and resolve as his legs and bare feet burned with sharp pain.
“I thought it was just a balancing record,” Lam said. “I wasn’t prepared for the pain and pressure on the bones in my feet.”
Lam hopes that his unorthodox feat of endurance will encourage others to use their unique abilities effectively to do good.

As many Harvard students who made the pilgrimage to New Haven before Thanksgiving break can attest, shuttles provided by Harvard Student Agencies were the glue that connected our campuses in fierce school spirit.
We at Flyby have found a hero in the person of Evan MacKay ’19, a Hollis Hall freshman from Vero Beach, FL who served as a Shuttle Controller for Harvard-Yale.
Flyby: How did you rise to this privileged appointment?
Evan: I saw an email about the opportunity to work for the shuttles team…I said that I was interested in taking on additional responsibilities beyond just being a monitor, and so I was chosen to be one of the Shuttle Controllers for the event.
Flyby: What is the job description for a Shuttle Controller?
The Shuttle Controllers are involved in the departures of all of the shuttles, and so we are in charge of swiping HUIDs and checking tickets… The Dean’s office needs to know where all the students are at all times, so that way if something happens to one of the buses, then we can immediately let them know who was on that bus and where they are…[our job was] maintaining accountability and ensuring safety for all the students.
Flyby: So what past leadership experiences best prepared you for this call to service?
Swiping my credit card at CVS definitely prepared me for this experience.
Flyby: Did you learn anything about Harvard students or about Life as a result of your experience as Shuttle Controller?
It definitely gave me a lot of insight into the jobs of people who are involved in transportation… I was talking to a guy last night and he said that he spent over 100 hours planning all the logistics that went into this short weekend event! It takes quite a bit of prior planning and organizational stuff. Anything that I’ve learned about life? Ummm, I’m not sure about that one.
Flyby: Nothing about life?
I don’t think so…
Flyby: When you’re not controlling shuttles, what do you like to do in your free-time?
I enjoy playing tennis, reading, and running around Boston.
Flyby: Were there any times this weekend when you were called into action in response to a shuttle emergency?
On the Friday night departures, one of the buses wasn’t starting, so that was a little bit of a difficulty. And then all of a sudden it did start, so weren’t really sure whether we could trust it getting to New Haven. But we figured it was probably just easier to go with it and hope it worked out, and it did, so that was pretty neat.
Flyby: But were you prepared to jump into action if anything should have happened?
Absolutely. We were ready to evacuate the students from the dangerous shuttle situation if the need arose.
I think something that I did not realize [before] this experience is how many times there would be a bus driver who would be like ‘Oh, I have no clue where we’re going for this,’ or ‘Can I follow one of the other buses? Because I don’t know where we’re going.’ … You think that those bus drivers have some sort of special [navigation] experience or something like that, but they’re just using Google Maps the same way we are. One of the bus drivers approached me and said, “Is Yale really 14 hours away,” and I said “I do not think so.” I looked on his Google Maps and he was in “biking mode.” … I didn’t think the Harvard students on the bus would be willing to wait for him to bike the bus to Yale.
Flyby: I’ve definitely never done that before. Let’s end with some rapid-fire questions: Are heroes born or made?
Heroes are made. By experiences such as this one.
Flyby: Harvard scarf, Harvard hat, or Harvard sweater?
Sweater.
Flyby: Harvard-Yale game-time, standing or Sitting?
Standing!
Flyby: Do you endorse the optimal buzz?
Absolutely.
Flyby:What is your position on hydration?
Always hydrate. Hydration is the key to success.
Flyby: What is your position on Yale?
Yuck Fale.
