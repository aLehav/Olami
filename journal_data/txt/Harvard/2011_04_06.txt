After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I can’t remember a time when I didn’t know about rape. And I can’t  remember how I learned. I just know it was there, always there. Being  raped altered and shaped my mother’s identity, and I always knew that.
When I was nine or ten, maybe 11, and I wanted to know the details about  my mother’s rape, all I had to do was look it up. My mother had been  telling her story for 20 years.
I learned the details about my  mother’s rape by reading the first chapter of Real Rape, a book she  wrote about rape law in America. A book that began with a chapter called  “My Story.” And as I read about the trauma, the aftermath, the way the  Boston police treated her, and how the doctors at the hospital  responded, I also realized that it wasn’t just me who knew these  details. People all over the place could—and did, in fact—also know the  painful details of my mother’s rape. It was unnerving.
My mom was 21. Just a few months older than I am today. She was a senior  at Wellesley. It was two days before her college graduation. He was a  stranger with an ice pick. She was parking her car in the alley behind  her apartment in Boston. I used to think it happened at night, but that  must be a detail supplied by my imagination. I know this because a quick  online search tells me that my mother was raped in the afternoon, not  the evening. A Thursday afternoon. My mom was raped on a Thursday  afternoon in May by a man wielding an ice pick. The police never found  him.
For a while, I wasn’t sure if this was a story that I was allowed to  tell. The first time I told friends that my mom had been raped, they  admonished me. “That’s private,” they said. I knew the story wasn’t  private. But maybe I wasn’t allowed to tell it. It was my mother’s  story.
It wasn’t until recently that I understood that even though I wasn’t  there in the alley that Thursday afternoon, this was my story, too.
My  mother’s rape and her subsequent decision to devote much of her  professional life to studying, teaching, and fighting to change rape law  shaped my childhood. I grew up with my mother’s fight and also her  fears of rape echoing in a constant loop inside my head. And in this  way, my her story became a part of my story.
My mother’s mother told my mother she shouldn’t tell anyone that she had  been raped. That if she did, nobody would want her. She had been  soiled. My mom refused to hide. To hide would be to suggest that this  was something to be embarrassed about—something that was somehow her  fault. Hiding would preclude her from being able to really fight back.
Two weeks ago, I directed a production of “A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant  and a Prayer,” a collection of monologues compiled by Eve Ensler about  rape and violence against women. This production would not and could not  have happened 30 years ago at Harvard. Close to 30 years ago, my mother  was a young professor at Harvard Law School. She was teaching Criminal  Law and had planned to devote one day to discussing rape law. On that  day, she told her class about her rape experience. If the subject was  armed robbery and had she been robbed by a man with an ice pick, she  wouldn’t have thought twice about mentioning it. Nobody would bat an  eye. But this was rape. And rape, my mother was told, should not be  discussed in public.
Even though she was scared of the repercussions, she told her story. The  campus exploded with discussion. The Crimson wrote about it. She  received much more criticism than support. One day she received a phone  call from someone who said, “I’m one of your students, and before the  end of the semester, I’m going to rape you, too.” The police tapped her  phone line and asked her to call on students who she thought might  particularly hate her in class, to see if any of their voices sounded  familiar. The investigation was inconclusive.
Two weeks ago, 36 years after my mother’s rape and nearly 30 years after  my mother was threatened when she spoke out at Harvard, I stood on  stage in the Adams Pool Theater, sharing this story and opening a  production about true stories of rape and violence.
My mother told her story even though she was afraid. She still is. But  thanks to her bravery and her fight, I am not afraid. I am conscious of  the dangers. I am cautious when I walk around alone at night and would  never accept a drink from a stranger. I have taken multiple full-impact  self-defense courses. I have known about rape for as long as I can  remember.
But thanks to my mother’s bravery, I am not afraid.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Politicians are slippery characters. Broken promises, false principles, and insincere platitudes have time and time again taught the populace to view our elected officials with a degree of skepticism. And once again, Arizona has led the way in justifying public cynicism. The state has recently passed a bill that prohibits abortions performed for racial or gender-based reasons. Although such heinous prejudice is undeniably abhorrent, the need to prevent—legally—the practice is questionable. The lack of racist or sexist abortions performed in the United States suggests that Arizona’s law is not a sincere means to combat such non-existent discrimination but a sly attempt to restrict abortions. The practical effects of the bill are dangerous and ensure that Arizona’s latest law is more of a threat to constitutional rights than a protection.
The law states that it is illegal to perform an abortion due to the race or sex of the fetus. As a result, fathers of an aborted fetus and parents of underage mothers who have abortions can prosecute a doctor for carrying out an abortion that was sought for sexist or racist reasons. The doctor could face heavy fines and up to three-and-a-half years in prison.
Of course, to abort a fetus because of race or sex is horribly prejudiced, and the practice is rightly prohibited in areas where it is a concern, such as China. However, evidence that selective abortion takes place in Arizona is unfounded and disputed. Supporters of the bill claim that minority women constitute a high percentage of those who seek abortions and that abortion clinics are intentionally located in minority areas. Yet this does not logically imply that such women seek abortions for racist reasons, as surely a minority woman is no less likely to share her race with the foetus. The rationale of Arizona’s bill suggests that a woman might have no other reason to abort a foetus other than race, yet the prospect of a woman who is prepared to start a family with her partner but unwilling to share his ethnicity with their child seems highly improbable.
Currently, women are not required to state their reasons for wanting an abortion. However, the new bill ensures that a woman’s motives can be questioned and that doctors are subject to potential liability. The risk of sexist or racist accusations can surely only serve as deterrence for those doctors who perform abortions, while the difficulty of verifying personal motives suggests that groundless legal cases could still cause significant cost to any defendants.
Furthermore, Arizona’s official acknowledgment of such prejudiced motives suggests that women are apt to abort a fetus due to discriminatory reasons. This in itself casts an unsavoury shadow on women who seek abortions, and critics of the bill argue that the law is intentionally polarizing.
However, the law’s greatest threat lies in its insinuation that the rationale for seeking an abortion demands evaluation. A woman’s right to have an abortion is constitutionally sanctioned, and to limit this right due to personal incentives is dangerous. Although different people have different standards of acceptability with regard to various situations in which an abortion may be necessary,  a woman’s right to seek an abortion is absolute and not contingent on “justifiable” motives. As a result, Arizona’s latest abortion law is an unconstitutional restriction of personal rights.
Due to the lack of evidence for racists or sexist abortions in Arizona, the state’s latest bill is not a genuine effort to counter prejudice, but an attempt to restrict women’s right to choice. The claim by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer’s spokesperson that the legislation is “consistent with her pro-life record” reveals the true intentions that underlie the act’s pretence of egalitarianism. Arizona is notorious for racial profiling and has significant racist concerns to tackle. Discrimination against unborn fetuses is not such a concern, and the bill practically threatens the rights of the mother more than it protects those of the unborn child. This falsity and political cunning is dangerous indeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You get a first sense of the amount of attention paid to teaching at the College by the fact that Harvard felt the need to launch a “Teaching and Learning Initiative.” You don’t hear about the Red Sox launching a “Winning the World Series Initiative” or Charlie Sheen launching a slightly simpler “Winning Initiative”—winning is a core part of their identities, not something they have to initiate.
You get a second sense by the fact that this initiative was actually launched four years ago and has languished incognito until now. At a poorly attended faculty meeting in March 2007, the few faculty members in attendance received the “Compact on Teaching and Learning” with disdain. An applauded remark by Latin Professor Katherine M. Coleman lay the blame, as always, at the feet of distracted and disinterested students: “Some students don’t come to class, or they come late, or they surf the Web during lectures or even sections, I’ve noticed.” Obviously, if someone fails to appreciate the wisdom and clarity of your remarks, the fault must surely be theirs.
But props for noticing!
You get a third sense by observing that the College picked up this initiative during a period of budget crisis, precisely at the moment when there are few resources to devote to it. I should give credit where credit is due, however, and point out that in a single year they did manage to organize three—count them—colloquia to discuss this important subject.
But if you want to follow this disinterest to the source, go to graduate school. Graduate school is where future academics learn their disrespect for teaching.
Graduate students are taught that teaching is easy. One half-day course at the Bok Center—all my department required—and you’re ready to teach section as a teaching fellow. Teach section for one class in a six-year Ph.D. program—all my department required—and you’re ready to teach undergraduates as a junior faculty member. As a result, most future academics (including myself) enter their ﬁrst academic position not knowing how to design a class, write a full set of lectures, or balance our time between research and instruction.
Graduate students are taught that teaching is not important. The reason graduate students aren’t required to teach more is that faculty want them in the lab or the library doing research. Research is what earns you a job, tenure, and worldwide renown; teaching is a distraction. Graduate students with an interest in teaching hear warning after warning that this is not the right thing to do. “You’ve taught enough.” “You need more papers on your resume, not another class.” “Why are you so interested in teaching? Is your research going OK?”
Departments even establish incentives to discourage graduate students from teaching. I was required to teach one semester, and when I chose to keep teaching, I was not paid for my labors. Instead, the money I would have received was routed to my adviser to pay him for my “lost” research productivity. Of course, the research papers still had to get written, and at the end of the day, I was working harder than I would have been doing research alone and being paid the same amount.
Finally, graduate students are taught that teaching is unrewarding. Researched-obsessed faculty members consistently deﬁne impact in ways that bring them either extra attention, money, or—ideally—both. Few seem excited by the chance to inspire young minds or driven to direct their considerable creative and analytical powers towards transforming the learning process. My former department has senior faculty who have contributed in many ways to the broader Harvard community, but none of them stepped forward to transform CS50.
In reality, teaching isn’t what graduate students are taught. Teaching is challenging, and only becoming more so as technology changes the educational landscape. Change has always meant that teacher and student learn somewhat differently, but today, the pace of technological advance has widened this gap substantially. Yet even computer scientists are still delivering lectures as if there were no YouTube, giving PowerPoint presentations as if there were no iPad, and designing assignments as if there were no Wikipedia.
Teaching is important, and although that alone may sound somewhat obvious, teaching is also important at research universities. If we don’t ﬁnd a way to rebalance the incentives to ensure that Harvard faculty are creative and accomplished both as teachers and as researchers, then at some point prospective students and their families are going to see through the myth that mere hobnobbing with a rock star faculty constitutes a good education.
So. Do these mythical creatures exist—the researcher who can teach, and the teacher who can research? You might as well ask, are there baseball players that can both hit and play defense?I Or, even better, is Charlie Sheen really capable of winning both here and there? Teaching, like winning, is challenging, important, and fundamentally rewarding. But if we want to develop a new generation of dynamic college educators, we have to start by changing what they are taught in school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, several Harvard undergraduates will hold an information session to advocate for a new secondary field in Innovation for Social Change. Although a Social Innovation secondary may initially seem out of place alongside a secondary in English or one in economics, when considered against of the successful model of the recent Global Health and Health Policy secondary, it shows promise.
In recent years, the popularity of Global and Health and Health Policy has increased markedly as students have become involved with the field in academic and extracurricular ways. The most prominent example is the academic juggernaut of Societies of the World 25: Case Studies in Global Health, which is taught in part by superstar University Professor Paul Farmer and spawns graduates that bring major course ideas to a variety of other academic areas and departments. Additionally, the Harvard Global Health Institute offers multiple summer internships and fellowships in the field for undergraduates, two of which are cosponsored by the Institute of Politics. There are multiple, undergraduate clubs and publications that deal with the issue—the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum, the Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition, the Harvard College Global Health Review, the Harvard College Health Policy Review, and the Harvard College Health Management Group all come to mind. The GHHP secondary thus builds an academic framework for what is otherwise a loose collection of interest groups circling around the same subfield of development, global medicine, an nutrition.
We see this Social Innovation secondary as building a similar academic framework within the College for social entrepreneurship. There are already highly popular courses dealing with social entrepreneurship in some way; Sociology 159: Social Entrepreneurship, Sociology 109: Leadership and Organizations, and Computer Science 50 come to mind. The Harvard College Innovation Challenge and Elevator Pitch competitions, sponsored by the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum, and the new HBS Innovation Lab also bring students together around this interest area. We see this proposed secondary as providing dialectic clarity to this burgeoning and important field.
The one problematic aspect of this proposal, however, is the proposition that real-life experiences should deserve course credit. True, there are programs that allow for this: The Undergraduate Teaching Experience Program is one, but it involves coursework at the Graduate School of Education as well as fieldwork. It thus seems a bit problematic that, potentially, a variety of unaccountable internships and work experiences might count for course credit. Thus, while we could envision the Social Innovation secondary as supporting classes that have a fieldwork component, fieldwork in itself is not enough for course credit.
Most importantly, however, we recognize the enthusiasm of the undergraduates who have lobbied for the consideration of Innovation for Social Change for a secondary field and who continue to work tirelessly in realizing the project. By taking the initiative to question the framework of academic pursuits offered at the College, they have demonstrated a genuine investment in their academic careers beyond performing well in their required academic courses.

Subject: Looking for a roommate next year?
To: adams-schmooze, CSA, chess club, finance-somethingorother-l, half-asian association
Hi everyone!
I’m a freshman (rising sophomore now!) looking for a super friendly roommate for next year in the greatest house ever ADAMS!! Priority goes to fellow Ec concentrators, who would ideally have a large TV and a secondary in Applied Math. Must be 21 (so we can get our party on!) and be willing to share clothes. I eat dinner every day at 5:45 p.m., so I’d love it if your schedule could accommodate this. Also, if you have a room in mind that has a tub instead of a shower, I like to take long baths with my bath salts—which I’d obviously be happy to share! Must be DFCM (Down for classical music). If you’re interested, I’d be happy to meet up for a cup of coffee some time.
Athletes need not apply.
Best wishes,
Robert

Friends,
I’m reaching the point where I’m open to gender-neutral housing. That means that if you’re concentrating in anything other than sciences, are about to be or are already 21, and have a TV (of any size, at this point), please respond. Dinners are still a priority for me, however, so make sure that still works for you. Let’s figure this out. I know you’re out there ....

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid complaints about the lack of appealing programming and poor communication of available opportunities, Optional Winter Activities Week failed to attract the participation of the large majority of the student body, according to a report presented by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds at yesterday’s Faculty meeting.
Among students who responded to the College’s survey about winter break, 37 percent attended the inaugural week of programming held in January. The majority of students indicated that they “had other plans.”
The report presented by Hammonds offers recommendations for addressing students’ concerns about OWAW and the earlier weeks of winter break, but also cautions against spending undue funds and staff time on the scarcely populated weeks.
“It is important for the College to determine whether and how to grow the program and to allocate staffing and other resources accordingly,” the report reads.
“The College should determine whether it wants OWAW to be one of the hallmarks of the undergraduate experience and to plan accordingly, not only in terms of staffing and resources, but also in managing people’s expectations about the week’s goals,” the report adds.
Despite the oftentimes dismal complaints reported in the poll, Hammonds projected a rosy image of OWAW in yesterday’s Faculty meeting, praising the long break as a time when students could “decompress from the high-stress lives they lead on campus.”
Many of the 924 students who responded to the survey lauded the time they spent relaxing at home during break and the opportunity to enjoy a week at Harvard without schoolwork. Others said they participated in activities as diverse as applying for a patent, seeking treatment for an eating disorder, and getting engaged.
Upon studying these responses, which ranged from thrilled to embittered, College administrators agreed that the College’s approach to winter break, which has not been clearly articulated since calendar reform created the lengthy gap between semesters two years ago, still needs further review.
CHANGES TO A LONELY TIME
The report presented yesterday includes numerous recommendations, which Hammonds and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith are currently considering.
For instance, the report recommends opening House dining halls as social spaces, although only Annenberg Hall serves meals during winter break, and potentially offering nighttime snacks in the dining halls to alleviate the “severe loneliness” that some students who remained on campus for the duration of winter break described.
The report also tentatively suggests opening one River and one Quad dining hall to address one of the most virulent and frequent complaints on the survey: that walking through the brutal January weather to Annenberg was a hassle during break.
Just two-thirds of respondents who lived on campus over the break said they ate meals in Annenberg.
“Having to travel from the Quad to Annenberg often meant I didn’t eat,” one respondent wrote.
Others who did not eat in Annenberg said it was due to the scheduled mealtimes, not the distance. Those performing research in labs off-campus said they spent lunch and dinner hours away from the Yard, but they would have eaten breakfast in Annenberg if it had been served.
Associate Dean and Senior Adviser to the Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin II, who led the committee that oversaw winter break, said that “the financial constraints [of opening a second dining hall] are real.”
“It will come down to cost,” he said. “The desire to put the additional funds into term-time activities is still a priority. ... It would mean a reduction in services during the academic term which all students would feel.”
McLoughlin said that the hefty portion of students staying on campus who did not eat meals in Annenberg indicates that the College can provide on-campus housing during winter break to more students next year, since the capacity of Annenberg was the limiting factor which determined the number of berths offered this year.
The next group that would likely be given housing, McLoughlin said, is students who have independently secured January jobs and internships in Cambridge or Boston.
This year, according to the report, these students were officially denied housing. However, the report notes that House staff later granted residence to many of these students, which McLoughlin said brought an undesirable level of inequity to the housing approval process.
WINTER MAY ALWAYS BE ‘SMORGASBORD’
Hammonds announced yesterday that next year’s OWAW will be stretched from eight days to ten in order to avoid reopening the Houses on a weekend day.
Aside from this change, next year’s OWAW is likely to resemble this year’s, despite the fact that 70 percent of pollees said they would participate in credit-granting courses if they were available during OWAW and that the Undergraduate Council has advocated for a two-week winter activities session with more faculty-led programs.
McLoughlin says that he wants to see students “voting with their feet” to determine how the College will focus in the long term on winter offerings.
He said it might be telling if, for example, less than 40 percent of the student body appears for OWAW again next year but attendance spikes at off-campus programs, such as the Office of Career Services’ Career Treks—which this year drew 65 students during the first weeks of break and another 65 during OWAW—and the career shadowing spots sponsored by the Harvard Alumni Association.
In that case, McLoughlin said, “We may decide to invest more in those and less on activities here on this campus.”
“I think our goal is to continue at the moment to beef up both: to continue more January experiences, to explore more funding for international travel, and thirdly to continue offering this week of on-campus activities and then see what students want to do,” McLouglin said. “It’s possible that that smorgasbord of options will be what winter break will always look like.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starbucks will open another location in Harvard Square in late May—a two-level shop open until 1 a.m. that will host live music and coffee tastings in the evenings.
The new store, the third Starbucks to open in Harvard Square, is located at the corner of JFK Street and Mass. Ave.
With extended hours and two floors of seating, the designers and operators of the new Starbucks location hope that the new store will become a hub for students and coffee enthusiasts.
TWO LEVELS
The two-floor design is a special feature of select Starbucks stores often found in busy cities, such as Washington, D.C.
“It’s very location-specific. It’s not something you would go out and look for but it’s when you see a location that has the opportunity,” says Stacey L. Krum, a Starbucks spokesperson.
The first floor will operate as a traditional Starbucks with limited seating for people who want to get a cup of coffee or grab a snack.
On the second floor, seating options will include two community tables—designed to appeal to students and other customers who need extra work space—as well as smaller tables for individual or small-group work. Customers will be able to pull the smaller tables together for more group seating.
There will also be soft seating, couches, lounge areas, and café tables.
“I tried to create many different zones depending on what people want,” says Kambiz Hemati, the concept designer of the new store.
The tables will also be equipped with electrical outlets, and the store will offer free Wi-Fi.
Both floors will feature the Clover brewing system—found only in some stores—in which special batches of coffee are brewed one cup at a time.
“When Starbucks partners finda coffee with a particular interesting flavor, it’s sold on its own. There will be enough to do these small batches,” Krum says.
The specialty coffee is sold as a “Starbucks Reserve coffee” and includes varieties such as Kona Coffee and Papua New Guinea Arokara.
The coffee bar upstairs will operate mainly at night for tastings and samplings of the special brews. The second floor will also feature a stage for live music performances and readings.
“Our mission is that the entertainment will support the coffee vibe,” says C. Shane Sykes, the general manager of the new store.
Sykes, who worked for Starbucks previously at the Memorial Drive location, says he is particularly excited about the new Harvard Square location due to the complexity of the two-story set-up and the opportunity to host coffee seminars that are open to the public.
“The second floor is a special opportunity to deliver a unique coffee experience,” Sykes says.
THREE STARBUCKS
Though the new store will be the third Starbucks in Harvard Square and the seventh store in Cambridge, Sykes says the new location will be a little over 3,000 square feet and be more open compared to the other more crowded locations. The second floor windows will overlook Harvard Square.
“I guarantee that the second floor is the best view in Cambridge with huge windows. We’ll take advantage of that by having two soft seating chairs and a low table in front of a window,” Hemati says.
The store will be open seven days a week from 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. to appeal to late night customers.
Sykes says he does not think the new store will take away profits from other Starbucks locations in Harvard Square.
“Each store has its individual set of regulars, but the beauty of Starbucks is that we share those regulars,” Sykes says.
THE HEART OF HARVARD SQUARE
Krum says that the design of the new store will set it apart from the other Square locations.
“It’s not the traditional look and feel people have gotten used to,” Krum says.
Krum says the new design will capture the culture of Cambridge and Harvard Square.
“We don’t want the stores to all look alike. We want them to fit better in each community that they serve,” Hemati says. “I’ve tried to make the store specific to the people that are going to use it, mainly students.”
The design team has been enthusiastic about working with the building’s historic architecture, says Krum, adding that the new store will be certified according to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, which evaluate how environmentally friendly a building is. The store will use recycled materials, reclaimed furniture, and barn wood.
Hemati is in the process of looking for art that relates to the history of Harvard Square to decorate the walls, including an old picture of the building. The building is one of the oldest structures in Harvard Square.
Sykes has joined the Harvard Square Business Association and has focused on socializing and networking in the community with local organizations. Starbucks will contribute to several community-oriented events, including an event with Teen Empowerment in Somerville and Cycle Kids in Harvard Square.
“[Sykes] seemed to be incredibly committed to the Square community, especially since he grew up in Cambridge,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. “He has a long history here, and we’re looking forward to working with him.”
The location has significant meaning to Sykes, who was born in Cambridge. Sykes’ mother managed a coffee shop in 1972 on JFK Street, and Sykes served his first cup of coffee in Harvard Square at age six.
“It’s like going full circle. We’re very excited to be in the heart of the Square,” Sykes says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University has had a heavy hand in funding the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps at MIT through a legally separate entity called the Friends of Harvard ROTC Trust, though Harvard has not officially recognized or funded the program since the early 1990s, according to alumni and members of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC.
While Harvard has not publicly supported the Trust, alumni say that the Harvard Alumni Affairs & Development office and individuals at Harvard originally helped to create the Trust and have assisted in coordinating significant donations since.
Additionally, donations given to the Trust are counted as a gift to the University, “as if they had given to Harvard,” said Michael Segal ’76, a member of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC.
The Trust was created under the auspices of Boston law firm Choate Hall & Stewart to shoulder the overhead costs of ROTC at MIT, where Harvard students participating in ROTC currently train. Its creation followed a Faculty Council vote in 1994 that prohibited Harvard from paying for costs associated with the program while “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the military policy that banned gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military—was in place.
Following the December repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” University President Drew G. Faust signed an agreement with the Navy to recognize ROTC last month.
The repeal will not be implemented until it goes through a certification process that is slated to conclude later this year.
According to the Trust’s most recent tax filing, in fiscal year 2009 the Trust paid MIT $136,344.
“Harvard was definitely involved,” Segal said. “The Harvard alumni people were involved and they helped in facilitating of the setting up of this fund.”
Two or three prominent alumni have donated to the Trust, covering the yearly costs which range from about $130,000 to $160,000, depending on the number of students enrolled in the ROTC program.
“The Trust is just a vehicle for handling the money to ensure that MIT gets its fair share allocation,” said Chairman of Advocates for Harvard ROTC Capt. Paul E. Mawn USNR (Ret.) ’63.
Though Harvard has not been directly involved, Mawn said, the “whole thing was a wink-and-a-nod process.”
Segal said that Harvard may have felt compelled to offer institutional support to the Trust because the University has continued to accept scholarships awarded to ROTC participants by the federal government.
The money associated with the program “sort of flows in and out,” Segal said.
In 2002, then-University President Lawrence H. Summers told students he felt the funding arrangement for ROTC was “unorthodox” and “uncomfortable.”
The alumni who have donated to the Trust have remained anonymous to many members of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC, said Warren M. Schur ’69.
The donors to the Trust have likely requested anonymity in part because of anti-military sentiment, said Malcolm Hill ’59, who serves as the president of the alumni fund of the Advocates—a separate fund related to ROTC.
“There’s still substantial amount of anti-ROTC feeling among those folks who make up the of the grand glorious Harvard alumni,” Hill said.
The two trustees of the Trust, Harold J. Keohane ’60 and Charles A. Cheever ’90, declined to comment.
According to Segal, several years ago the founder of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC, David Clayman ’38, suggested to the Harvard Corporation that they create an endowment that would fund ROTC costs. The Corporation said it would consider helping the Trust to set up an endowment, but Segal said he does not know what happened to the plans.
Clayman passed away a few years later.
The future status of the Trust has been called into question by the recent recognition of ROTC.
While Mawn said he imagines that the Trust “is just going to evaporate,” its fate remains unclear.
The Harvard Alumni Affairs and Development office did not respond for comment yesterday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student organizations that have protested the Westboro Baptist Church in the past plan to ignore the group’s picket in Harvard Square this morning, according to student leaders from Harvard College Queer Students and Allies and the Harvard College Democrats.
The WBC’s picket is in protest of the memorial service being held in honor of the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes,  who served as the minister at Memorial Church and the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals for 35 years.
Gomes—who was openly gay and a prominent advocate for equality—has frequently been targeted by the WBC over the years. The Kansas church, which protests what it describes as America’s support of homosexuality, is best known for picketing military funerals with homophobic signs and slurs.
When the WBC picketed Harvard in the past, the QSA and the Dems’ counterprotests have drawn crowds of hundreds of students in response.
Religion Professor Diana L. Eck conveyed the sentiment that this time, it would be better to ignore the WBC, and the Dems were glad to oblige, according to Dems Communications Director Christine A. Hurd ’13, who is a Crimson Arts comper.
“She thought that because they weren’t going to be allowed on Harvard property, it would just take away from the memory and just feed their propaganda,” Hurd said.
Hurd noted that the circumstances surrounding this WBC picket differ from past protests. The church has protested organizations such as Cambridge Rindge and Latin’s gay-straight alliance and Harvard Hillel.
As this picket detracts from Gomes’ service, student organizations were less inclined to counterprotest, Hurd said.
Acting Memorial Church Minister Wendel W. “Tad” Meyer said that Memorial Church did not ask student groups not to protest.
“Our response was enormous sadness,” said Meyer of learning about the WBC’s plans to picket. Meyer said that he had been in touch with the Harvard University Police Department, which assured him that the picketing would not affect the service.
Despite not demonstrating on this occasion, QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11 said he still believes in the value of counterprotest when it comes to the WBC.
“Whether we counterprotest or not, they’re going to be people that walk by and see the hate and the kind of messages they are spreading,” Chan said. “Ignoring it doesn’t make it disappear.”

University Professor Lawrence H. Summers, who was director of President Obama’s National Economic Council after serving as the president of Harvard, urged that the U.S. government not cut spending in the face of ongoing fiscal negotiations in Congress.
Speaking at the Institute of Politics yesterday, Summers commended Obama’s preference to “err on spending too much rather than err on spending too little.”
Harvard Kennedy School Professor David R. Gergen, a former presidential adviser, hosted a conversation with Summers at the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum that focused on his two-year stint in Washington, D.C., before he returned to Harvard in January.
Now back in Cambridge, the former University president reflected on the difference between working in an academic environment and in Washington.
“In a university setting the focus is to find out what the best policy is,” Summers said. “In Washington, everyone wants to feel that they had an important impact on policy and prove this to their constituents.”
But Summers also joked about his early departure from his post as University president.
“I have not always been successful in every position I have held,” he said.
In yesterday’s conversation, Summers focused on the current U.S. financial troubles and the changing nature of employment for middle and low-income citizens.
He reassured the audience that the country’s economic difficulties are “manageable” compared to the problems other countries currently face, citing the recent natural disasters that struck Japan and China’s ongoing struggles to maintain high standards of living for its citizenry.
“I think that we in the United States have a tendency every decade to decide that there is a global power stronger than us and assume that it surpasses us on many levels,” Summers said.
“Today we have this tremendous apprehension about China. It would be helpful for Americans to have faith in the resilience of our country,” he said.
The U.S. has persevered through much greater crises in the past, Summers assured, such as the Great Depression and World War II.
“History would have judged us badly if we had allowed ourselves to fall into another Great Depression,” Summers said. “And it doesn’t look like we will.”
But Summers said he was concerned about a growing income gap in the United States.
“When I ask myself what I worry about in the United States in 2030, I worry most about what increased inequalities will do to the legitimacy of our system,” he said.
He said that the workforce has shifted, as many low-skilled workers may have to adapt to new forms of employment to retain a satisfactory standard of living.
Jobs for middle and low-income citizens are going to be focused “more on what your brain can do and less on what your hands can do,” he said.

Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds has acquiesced to pressure and agreed to change the name of the Optional Winter Activities Week, she said at yesterday’s Faculty meeting.
One of her ideas for the name of the final week before the beginning of the spring semester sounds a bit like a popular morning drink.
“Another option that has been presented is OJ-Term,” she said, “for Optional January Term.”
After some faculty members chuckled, Hammonds paused.
“OK, some of you are laughing, so we’ll continue to work on that,” she said.
Hammonds said that a priority for the review of OWAW—or OJ-Term, or whatever—would include changing its name, which she said is currently pronounced like “Oh-Wah.”
“Students continue to call it J-Term, despite our best efforts to name it otherwise,” Hammonds said. “We’ve lost that battle.”
THE STUDENT SLOTH
Hammonds presented a positive review of this year’s inaugural OWAW at yesterday’s Faculty meeting, but a couple professors suggested that the College provide more constructive course offerings to reach out to those more ambitious students.
Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 questioned the report’s dependence on certain student accounts.
“The one part of the report that troubles me quotes students hanging out with friends,” Lewis said.
According to Lewis, although students ought to relax during winter break, students who enjoyed their downtime are not necessarily indicators of the quality of OWAW.
He also said that in its review of OWAW, the College should have set a higher standard that expected students to do something more constructive.
Acknowledging that the College is on a tight budget to structure anything, Lewis suggested setting up a reading list for students.
“I do think that over time, we should think hard about what we would really students to do,” Lewis said.
“I am as unhappy about student sloth as I am about faculty greed,” Lewis added.
In response, Hammonds said that “I think there’s value to students taking their time off... [and] we should continue to think hard about what we would really like students to do over winter break.”
A SPECIAL           			WELCOME
Newly appointed Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor William “Ned” Friedman received a special welcome from faculty members in the meeting yesterday.
Friedman, who recently took charge of the Arnold Arboretum, was accidentally forgotten as Faust gave out honorary degrees to other candidates.
But as the meeting drew to an end, Faust brought up the matter and apologized.
“I hope we can compensate with rousing applause,” Faust said. “Soon we’ll have lilacs [in the arboretum,]” she added, to the laughter of faculty members.

A medical breakthrough in HIV prevention could eventually lead to the development of an AIDS vaccine, due to a recent discovery by researchers at the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Scientists took an antibody from an HIV-positive man who had not shown any symptoms of AIDS even after a decade of having HIV and administered it to rhesus monkeys. They then injected the monkeys with a form of the human HIV virus that was mutated so it could spread in monkeys.
Although the virus in the monkeys was a different strain than the original human virus, the antibody still effectively prevented the onset of AIDS symptoms. Monkeys who were administered the antibody remained completely symptom-free, while monkeys without the antibody suffered all of the normal effects of the virus.
This finding is significant because one of the fundamental challenges in the development of an HIV vaccine is accounting for the millions of different strains of the highly-mutable HIV virus. Due to the variance, an effective and practical vaccine must target commonalities between the strains.
“The big problem with so many millions of HIV virus out there is there needs to be a way to target the common theme,” said Harvard Medical School Professor Ruth M. Ruprecht, senior author of the study. “This is a step in the direction of identifying targets for vaccines.”
In this study, researchers were able to discover a similarity between multiple strains of the virus by discerning what part of the virus was targeted by the antibody.
Medical School instructor Nagadenahalli B. Siddappa, one of the lead authors of the study, also stressed the importance of the antibody’s apparently universal protective qualities, noting the difficulty scientists often face when attempting to develop a preventative vaccine for a continually evolving virus.
“[Scientists] always see different viruses,” he said. “This could be very useful.”
While researchers said they were excited about this finding and its potential significance, they also stressed that there is still a long way to go before any type of preventative vaccine is actually ready for use on humans. An active immunization, which could be widely administered to the public, must allow antibodies to be produced on their own by the body.
“The next step is to see if we can focus active immunization on the portion of the [virus] that is conserved,” Ruprecht said. “At the same time, we are trying to find other regions that are conserved” between strains.
Ruprecht also explained that this antibody is not thought to be a cure, though she left the possibility open.
“This is a different clinical situation,” she said. “This is not about the cure.”

Computer Science Professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 questioned University President Drew G. Faust on whether the University should actively criticize University Professor Michael E. Porter for his financial ties with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
At yesterday’s Faculty meeting, Lewis chided Porter for a 2006 report to the Libyan government on the part of his private consulting firm, Monitor Consulting Group, which repeatedly dubbed the regime a “popular” and “direct” democracy. Lewis said that Porter’s actions represented Harvard in a poor light, negatively affecting its global image.
“Harvard rightfully expresses its pride when a member of our community does something noble,” Lewis said. “I wonder if the University should not also express its shame when a faculty member disgraces the University.”
The Faculty meeting was otherwise largely policy-oriented, developing next year’s Optional Winter Activities Week and endorsing scheduling morning classes on Fridays next semester.
Following concerns expressed by faculty members and students about a lack of transparency in the process, Faust also summarized the University’s decision to repeal a ban on Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.
‘CRIMSON-TINGED REPORT’
Lewis addressed Faust after the University president had closed her presentation for the meeting.
“I don’t know that Professor Porter broke any laws or University rules, and I would not want any new regulatory apparatus,” Lewis said. “Yet taking money to support a tyranny by dubbing it a democracy is wrong.”
In February 2006, Porter presented a 200-page document to officials in Tripoli as a consultant to Monitor, a firm formed by several Harvard professors that was under several million-dollar contracts with the country.
In the report, Porter argued that Libya “has the only functioning example of direct democracy on a national level,” and that Libyans were able to directly contribute to the decision-making process, which drew heavy fire from Lewis in yesterday’s Faculty meeting.
“To put it simply, a tyrant wanted a crimson-tinged report that he was running a democracy,” Lewis said, bringing up the question of whether the University should acknowledge the “shame” when a faculty member disgraces the University in such a way.
“Shouldn’t Harvard acknowledge its embarrassment, and might you remind us that when we parlay our status as Harvard professors for personal profit, we can hurt both the University and all of its members?” Lewis said.
In response to Lewis’ criticism, Faust said that it was not the president’s responsibility to serve as “public scolder-in-chief.”
She said that Harvard recently conducted a review of the University’s policies on conflict of interest. But she said it should also be the University’s priority to support all faculty members to pursue academic inquiry.
DOCUMENTING ROTC
Faust offered a brief summary of the decisions that led to the return of ROTC to campus.
Her comments came less than a week after a Columbia university-wide legislative body made up of students, faculty, and staff announced their support for ROTC on campus. That move raised concerns at Harvard among students and the Faculty about the transparency of Harvard’s own process to recognize ROTC.
Faust said University President Neil L. Rudenstine established a committee in the 1990s that pivoted the ban of ROTC on the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” legislation. Once Congress repealed the policy, she said, the University could no longer legitimize banning ROTC.
“I viewed the repeal of DADT as a significant step towards inclusiveness,” Faust said.
BREAKFAST SEMINARS
Acknowledging that Friday “has become a day that is under-scheduled,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said that planning seminars to accommodate for athletes and students with inflexible afternoon responsibilities has become increasingly difficult.
Currently, no class longer than an hour can be scheduled before 1 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Classes before 1 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursday can be up to 1.5 hours.
But Harris said that longer seminar classes back loaded in the afternoon leave only a small window for students who juggle other activities during that time.
Harris also announced a Faculty decision to facilitate Harvard students who are not concentrating in Music but want to continue cross-registering at the New England Conservatory.
The policy change would allow students to take one or two courses in a term at the New England Conservatory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WOBURN, Mass.—Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85 said today that Jabrai Jordan Copney lured Justin Cosby, the victim of the May 2009 shooting in Kirkland House, into a basement where he was shot during a drug rip gone wrong.
Cosby met his alleged assailants—who posed as Harvard students to gain his trust—in a basement room in Kirkland where he thought that he would sell a large quantity of marijuana to the men. But, according to prosecutors, Copney and his accomplices instead tried to rob Cosby of the drugs.
Prosecutors said Blayn Jiggetts, an alleged accomplice, held the gun at the beginning of the transaction, but Copney took the gun after Cosby refused to hand over the marijuana. The exact details of what happened during the failed robbery is unclear, but prosecutors say that as Jiggetts reached for the marijuana, Copney fired three shots in the small room.
Prosecutors said yesterday during opening statements in Copney’s trial that the alleged gunman fired wildly—one shot lodging in a wall, another in a door, and a third hitting Cosby in the abdomen.
After being struck by the bullet, Cosby fled the entryway and stumbled down Dunster Street, where he fell to the ground, clutching whatever remaining marijuana he had intended to sell.
Bennett also said that Copney had enlisted the help of Jiggetts and Jason Aquino to provide the gun in the planned robbery.
Copney had become familiar with both Lowell and Kirkland House where his girlfriend Brittany Smith and her friend Chanequa Campbell lived, respectively, Bennett said.
On the day of the shooting, Bennett said, Copney, Jiggetts, and Aquino used the ID of Smith, a College senior at the time of the shooting, to open the door to the Kirkland entryway where the murder took place.
Prosecutors have also said that Jiggetts loaded the gun in Smith’s room as she watched.
The trial for Copney, who is charged with the first-degree murder of Cosby, officially began yesterday at the Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn with opening statements from both sides in the case.
Cosby was a Cambridge resident and was said to have sold drugs to Harvard students.
But in the defense’s opening statement, John A. Amabile, Copney’s attorney, said that prosecutors have tried to pin the blame on his client when, in fact, Jiggetts was the man who pulled the trigger.
Amabile contests the prosecution’s assertion that Jiggetts handed the gun to his client and will argue during the trial that there is not sufficient evidence to prove that it was Copney who fired the shots that killed Cosby.
“A homicide in the hallowed halls of Harvard University. Shocking. Somebody’s got to pay,” Amabile said in his opening statement. “The forces have [pinned it] against Jabrai Jordan Copney ... Does it matter that he’s innocent? It should. It does.”
Amabile said that prosecutors had started their investigation with a foregone conclusion—that Copney had pulled the trigger—and proceeded to construct evidence to support that argument.
As part of that strategy, Amabile said, the prosecution has made plea deals with several key players in the case, including Campbell. Amabile said that investigators have dangled carrots in the form of lesser jail time—and in the case of Campbell, a chance to get her degree—in order to secure their cooperation in the case against Copney.
“She’s thinking that if she comes around, maybe these Harvard alumni will get her reinstated,” said Amabile, referring to District Attorney Gerard T. Leone ’85 and Bennett, who both graduated from the College and lived in Kirkland House. Another prosecutor on the case, David M. Solet, is a 2001 graduate of the Law School.
Three witnesses, including a state trooper, a passerby, and a longtime friend of Cosby’s were called to the stand before court went into recess.
Massachusetts State Trooper Kathryn Downey was the first witness to take the stand. Downey was called to the scene of the crime on May 18 and lifted fingerprints from the front and rear right side doors of Cosby’s car.
The prosecution also showed a video that Downey made, providing a visual tour of the art room under J entryway where Cosby was allegedly shot.
Junior Nash, who had known Cosby since the third grade, said on the stand that Cosby had no job, sold marijuana to earn money, and frequently did so from his car.
The jury is scheduled to tour the area of Harvard today where the killing took place.
Prior to the start of the trial, Jiggetts and Aquino pleaded guilty to lesser charges of manslaughter, though they were both originally charged with first-degree murder. Part of Jiggetts’ agreement was to testify at Copney’s trial.
Campbell will be called to the stand once the trial resumes in Woburn.

Harvard’s own Harry Parker, coach of men’s heavyweight crew, is featured in a book about rowing: Peter Mallory's The Sport of Rowing: Two Centuries of Competition, a four-volume, 2500 page work. He just presented the latest two chapters, both of which focus on Parker yesterday on the website row2k.
Chapter 100: Parker vs. Rosenberg, focuses on the rivalry between two American powerhouse coaches. Mallory, using quotes from newspapers and rowing experts at the time, describes Harvard’s races against Vesper at Hunter Island Lagoon in 1964 and Henley in 1965. The Vesper boat club of Pennsylvania, under Coach Allen Rosenberg, beat Harvard to advance in the Olympic trials.
After this, clearly upset, Parker regrouped his eight men into a team of four who competed and won in the 1964 trials to represent the U.S. in the Olympic games.
At the Olympics, Parker studied and took note of the winning crews and international techniques to improve his squad. His crews began using English style oars, which are stiffer and sharper when cutting through water. He also analyzed leg, arm, and back use, as well as stroking techniques.
Parker’s work did not go unnoticed: Joe Burk, Parker’s mentor, called the 1965 team “the greatest American crew there has ever been, college or club.” Sports Illustrated named Harvard the world’s best.
Still, the Crimson club kept falling short of winning against Rosenberg’s Vesper crew. Author Mallory states that even after over forty years, Parker still remembers the rivalry between Rosenberg and himself.
Chapter 101: The Evolution of Harry Parker, looks into the development of Parker and Harvard crew.
Parker was no newbie to rowing; he was a member of Penn’s fastest eight and had competed in the Olympics as a single rower.
Parker’s coaching techniques, including slow paces to get the form of stroking correct, improved his team’s focus and skill in the 60s. After Parker took charge of Crimson crew, the team won Eastern Sprints ever year from 1964-1970.
Since then, Parker, now in his 49th season, has coached 20 undefeated regular seasons and won eight official national titles and eight unofficial titles.
Parker’s experience, both collegiate and international, helped him make Harvard crew internationally competitive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
League play is now underway in the Ancient Eight. The baseball and softball teams just finished two league double-headers and will play again this weekend, assuming the weather clears up a little. But the biggest news this week came from winter sports: Princeton’s basketball coach made a surprising announcement, and an Ivy League hockey player passed way after a two-year bout with leukemia. We’ll give you all the details in another edition of Around the Water Cooler. 
The week in Ivy League sports began in tragedy. After battling leukemia for the past two years, Mandi Schwartz, a former Yale hockey player, died on Sunday. She was 23.
Schwartz played in 73 consecutive games for the Bulldogs until receiving the grim diagnosis in the middle of her junior season. Shortly thereafter, she began an ardent search for a bone-marrow donor which in the end proved fruitless. But thanks to her efforts, more than 4200 people were added to the donor lists in Canada and the United States.
In other news around the Ivies, the Princeton men’s basketball team won’t be quite as tough next year after graduating Dan Mavraides and Kareem Maddox, two of the team’s top players.
But as of yesterday, Princeton will lose another key part of its 2010-2011 team: its coach.
Tigers coach Sydney Johnson announced yesterday that he will leave his post at Princeton to assume the head coach job at Fairfield College.  A former basketball player at Princeton, Johnson led the Tigers to a share of the Ivy League Championship this year and a berth into the Big Dance, where Princeton nearly upset a stacked University of Kentucky team in the second round. In four seasons under Johnson, the Tigers went 66-53.
Thanks to this news and the departure of two of Princeton’s stars, things are looking pretty good for the Harvard men’s basketball team right now.
The same can’t be said about the Crimson baseball team.
After losing its first nine games in a row, Harvard has continued to struggle and currently holds a meager 3-20 record. League opponents have steamrolled the Crimson, defeating Harvard by an average of six runs. What’s more, the Crimson is the only Ancient Eight team that has yet to win a league contest.
Harvard has a chance to turn things around this weekend as it plays double-headers against Princeton and lowly Cornell.
The Crimson softball team’s season couldn’t be more different than its baseball counterpart. 4-0 so far in league play, Harvard is already two games ahead in the North Division. But, this weekend won’t be as easy for the Crimson, as Harvard will square off in a double-header against Cornell, the defending Ivy League champion. Though the Big Red lost to Brown on Sunday, they still may be the team to beat in the Ancient Eight, thanks in large part to the play of Kristen Towne. Last week’s Ivy League Player of the week, the catcher/outfielder leads the team in home runs (6), RBI (23), total bases (53), and is second on the squad in slugging percentage (.654).

Following the footsteps of an older, more presidential Harvard alumnus, the Crimson women’s golf team made a trip to the nation’s capital this week hoping for change from its not so distant past.
But, for Harvard, Washington wasn’t as receptive.
Greeted by warm and windy conditions, the team took to the The Members Club course at Four Streams Monday against 16 other universities, playing two rounds and falling short of its expectations, placing 8th out of 17. But, for the Crimson, there was still much to take from its performance.
“Everything’s there,” captain Mia Kabasakalis said. “We’ve been striking the ball well, putting pretty well, and excitement about the season is high; we’ve just got to put everything together.”
Coming off a string of disappointing results, the Hoya Invitational offered the Harvard squad a chance to redeem itself: to end the uncharacteristically slow start which left the Crimson with two losses against UC Berkeley and Rollins College in the spring, and no wins from its fall campaign.
“The Georgetown Invitational was a great test to see where we were and gauge our standing against other Ivies,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We had been moving in a good direction the last week or so, and this allowed us to finally play against people with the same weather we had this year.”
On Monday, all this talk was put to the test.
In the first round, Kabasakalis looked to lead by example, posting a 79, the best Crimson finish of the day, which was only seven over par and six more than the tournament’s lowest score. Kabasakalis also recorded an 82 in the day’s second round, ranking her 22nd out of 89 competitors with a score of 161.
Not too far behind, freshman standout Bonnie Hu also had a great day on the greens, finishing only one stroke behind her team captain, ending tied for 24th on the day. Although Hu got off to a slower start in the first round, taking 82 strokes to finish the course, her play improved in the second round as she shot an 80, giving her the second-best final tally, 162, for the Harvard team.
“If I look at individual scores and where they were, the best players in the tournament and even in the Ivy were within a couple shots of Bonnie and Mia,” Rhoads said. “They both played exceptionally well given the conditions.”
Fellow rookie Julie MacDonnell turned in one of her best performances of the season. Although it took MacDonnell 86 strokes to get through the first round, she improved to 83 in the second, finishing at 169, and 52nd among the 89 competitors present. MacDonnell excelled on par-four holes, averaging just 4.4 strokes per hole, tied for fifth best in the tournament.
The coaching staff was more than impressed with the effort.
“We were very excited that Julie qualified for the event, and proved that she can play at a top-five level in the tournament,” Rhoads said. “Her long game is incredibly solid, [and] her short game [is] also. It was a great accomplishment to watch.”
For the rest of the team, success was a bit harder to find. Junior Jane Lee, the Crimson’s most consistent golfer on the course, posted two 83-stroke finishes which landed her tied at 40th place. A mere one stroke back was fellow junior Christine Cho, who ended with an 83 and 84-stroke performance, good enough for 42nd overall.
With all their efforts combined, the five Harvard golfers amounted to 655 strokes on the day, tying fellow Ivy League team Columbia, and falling 32 strokes short of the day’s best golfers: Nova Southeastern University (623). Yet, even so, the Crimson still had a chance to change their standing a bit in the final round, set to be played the following day.
But, due to a rainy day in the District, the third and final round was canceled, and Harvard’s hopes of winning the tournament were dashed.
This weekend, the team will be taking its talent to the Spring Brown Bear Invitational in Barrington, R. I., to get another swing at success.
“We need to get sharper,” Rhoads said. “There’s a lot of our game that we’ll need to fine tune to make up ground on the other Ivies. The biggest thing though is all mental; it’s easy to be calm when you play well, but when you’re a little bit off, the skill to stay confident is necessary.”
“You can’t worry about the wind or any external factors,” Kabasakalis added. “We need to only worry about the factors we can control. I think that we were all a little bogged down on Monday, and that really threw us off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the year, it looked like the TBS show to best describe the Harvard softball rotation was “Meet the Browns.”
These days, to the rest of the league, it’s a lot more like “House of Payne.”
At the start of the season, junior Rachel Brown was expected to put up MVP-caliber numbers and make a serious bid of any number of awards.
But the Crimson rotation isn’t a one-pony show anymore. Freshman Laura Ricciardone has put some stellar numbers of her own. Together, the two form what is probably the most formidable one-two punch on the mound in the Ancient Eight.
After the first weekend of Ivy League play, Brown sits at 11-4 with 11 complete games, 178 strikeouts, and a 1.69 ERA.
Ricciardone isn’t the same power pitcher that her teammate is. But she holds a 1.91 ERA, and her 6-3 record would be much higher had she gotten more offensive support in some of her starts.
If the two can hold form—Brown has actually performed better at the start of Ivy League play in years past—there won’t be much stopping them on the way to the Ivy League finals.
In the South Division, Cornell holds the top spot. As in 2010, the league looks like a match race, and barring injuries or some major upsets, we can expect a finals rematch between the Crimson and the Big Red.
This weekend’s doubleheader is the first time that the two teams will meet. More notably, the two-game set will likely feature the best head-to-head matchup the Ivy League has to offer.
Harvard might have the best one-two rotation, but Cornell senior Elizabeth Dalrymple is, at the moment, the class of the Ancient Eight. With a 0.77 ERA, she has been nothing short of dominant. Like Ricciardone, her 8-3 record is as low as it is only because of poor offensive showings early in the year.
For all of Harvard’s successes on the mound, it hasn’t been the same story at the plate. In all 10 of the team’s losses, the team has scored no more than four runs.
Even in five of its wins, the Crimson has scored two runs of fewer, and both Brown and Ricciardone have picked up losses in games that they otherwise pitched well.
Harvard has only scored a double-digit number of runs three times this year, including twice last week against a lowly Rhode Island team that came out of its doubleheader against Harvard with a 1-21 record.
The only other offensive burst for Harvard came in a blowout against Penn on Saturday, when the team won, 10-0. But the Quakers only lost the first game by a count of 2-1. The team has yet to reach the consistency that it would like to find as it moves into the heart of Ivy play.
Timeliness has been the Crimson’s biggest problem at the plate. The team is putting up solid numbers, and four of its starters are hitting above .300, including captain Ellen Macadam, who is hovering around a .450 batting average. Power numbers are a little down, especially for junior Whitney Shaw, who has hit just four this year.
But over the course of the year, the team is consistently leaving runners on base and missing opportunities to open up larger leads.
At the dish, freshman third baseman Kasey Lange is the biggest addition to the team—what classmate Ricciardone has been on the mound, Lange has been with the bat. Lange is second on the team in batting average, hitting .366, and leads in the team in doubles and RBIs.
For the Crimson, the strength of the rotation is clear. Assuming Brown and Ricciardone maintain their form and poise on the rubber, they’ll anchor the team as it looks to win the North Division.
As the old saying goes, pitching wins championships. But Harvard will need its lineup to get more timely hits if it wants to avoid a few bumps along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The opportunity for the Harvard softball team to extend its six-game winning streak will have to wait until this weekend. The chance for the Crimson baseball team to break its six-game losing streak will have to wait until Thursday. The softball team’s home game yesterday against Providence was canceled due to weather., while the baseball team’s contest against Bryant was postponed until Thursday.
The busy schedules of both softball squads mean there is no room for a makeup date and so the game will simply go uncounted on both seasons. This is the second Harvard softball game this spring that has been canceled, after a March 24 match-up against the Bulldogs was called in the fifth inning due to darkness.
The baseball game, originally scheduled to begin yesterday at 3:30, now will take place on Thursday at 2:00.
This year, the Crimson has a 3-20 record and looks to break their six-game losing streak on Thursday.
Bryant has gone 10-12 this season and is currently riding a one-game winning streak after their 3-1 win against Marist on March 29.
Meanwhile, Harvard softball will carry a six game winning streak, and nine out of the last ten, into this weekend’s Ivy League home-opener against Princeton and Cornell. The Crimson will play doubleheaders against the Tigers and Big Red on Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
The softball team is currently in first place in the Ivy League after going 4 and 0 at Columbia and at Penn over the weekend.
April showers across the Northeast have caused problems for softball teams around the Ivy League, with Cornell, Columbia and Brown being forced to postpone and/or cancel their out-of-conference April 5 games as well.
Weather forced the baseball teams at both Yale and the Bears to cancel games scheduled for Tuesday.  The Quakers moved the location of  their game against Rutgers on account of weather.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the lockout in the NFL, the draft is still scheduled to start April 28, and scouting remains active into the last few weeks before the 2011 amateur selection.
After a stellar senior season, captain defensive back Collin Zych has attracted the attention of a few NFL teams, according to Yahoo! Sports. The Jacksonville Jaguars and the Dallas Cowboys are both interested in the All-Ivy honoree, and Zych is reported to have pre-draft visits lined up with the two teams.
In the three seasons during which he played, Zych registered 224 tackles and six interceptions, and was named to the All- New England FCS team in addition to his All-Ivy recognition after his senior year. He led the Crimson in interceptions, and was tied for first on the team in tackles with teammate Nick Hasselberg.
The Texas native earned several accolades before the start of his senior season as well, including Ivy League Preseason Player of the Year and a spot on the preseason All-America team.
But if recent history is any indication, Zych has an uphill battle on the road to the NFL.
Harvard only has four players currently under contract with NFL teams, three of whom—including most notably quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05—see regular playing time. Fitzpatrick started for the Bills last year, throwing for 3000 yards and 23 touchdowns.
If he is drafted, he’ll also find himself in a professional football limbo—the draftees aren’t allowed to negotiate contracts after the expiration of the CBA.
The undrafted players will be in an even messier situation, as teams won’t even be able to talk to individuals who aren’t selected at the end of the month. Either way, though he looks promising as a prospect, Zych’s career is very much up in the air.

This week, students can earn a free Qdoba burrito and other shopping discounts and help save lives at the same time. At Eastern Mountain Sports today and Friday, from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., students can donate blood at the last Red Cross blood drive of the school year and, in return, receive a coupon for a free Qdoba burrito among other shopping discounts.
"Giving blood is a really good way to help those people who can't help themselves," said Godwin O. Abiola '14, the Harvard College Red Cross publicity chair. "All you have to do is sit there and the nurses will take care of you. It's one of the easiest ways to help out your fellow person."
In addition to a feeling of satisfaction from helping others (and perhaps a twinge of dizziness), donors will receive discounts at Eastern Mountain Sports and a free Qdoba burrito.
To book an appointment, students can sign up online or call (781) 461-2025. Even if students are ineligible to donate blood, they can still sign up to volunteer at the event.

Rule number one for avoiding the freshman 15—don't go to events just for the food. However, with Advising Fortnight taking place over the next two weeks, it's time for freshmen to forget about the rules and indulge in the cuisines each department is offering, hopefully learning more about potential concentrations along the way.
Although you may have missed Tuesday’s scrumptious "Sushi and Sociology" event, Wednesday alone brings freshmen a "History and Literature Ice Cream Social" in the Thompson Room of the Barker Center from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., followed by an "Astrophysics Pizza Seminar" with Professor of Astronomy Daniel Eisenstein on Large Scale Cosmic Structure in Room 80 of the Science Center from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
On Thursday, April 7, you can grab paninis on the fourth floor of Boylston Hall with the Department of Romance Languages and Literature for lunch from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. If Economics or Visual and Environmental Science interest you more, both departments are holding pizza and discussion time for dinner that night, Economics from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the third floor of the Littauer Center, and VES in the Sert Gallery Café of the Carpenter Center from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Other departments are taking more unconventional approaches. The Physics Department is enticing students with a monkey bread break in the Leverett Master's Residence on Sunday night from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. For a more culturally unique experience, enjoy "Dim Sum Delight" with East Asian Studies on Monday, April 11 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. on the first floor common room of 2 Divinity Ave. That same day, both the Music and English Departments are offering cupcakes and advice—Music from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Taft Lounge of the Music Building, and English from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the Thompson Room of the Barker Center.
Wednesday of the next week, April 13, brings freshmen a smorgasbord of cupcakes, samosas, chai tea, ice cream, and pizza as well as some top-notch advising help. Women, Gender, and Sexuality is offering cupcakes on the ground floor of Boylston Hall from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., and South Asian Studies is spicing things up with samosas and chai on the 3rd Floor of 1 Bow St. from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Want good old fashioned tea and cookies? Come chat with the Philosophy Department from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. in Emerson Hall 10. Round out the day of delectable dining with the Astrophysics Department for a "Pizza Seminar" from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. in Room 80 of the Science Center.
The Economics Department will be holding an "Economics Ice Cream Social" on Thursday, April 14 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the third floor lounge of the Littaur Center.
Although enticing food may draw students to the events, many freshmen said that they would not be swayed by the concentration presentations alone.
"[The food] might draw me to attend the event," Daniel J. Frim '14 said. "It would definitely not influence my choice of concentration though."

The senior gift committee recently released a video featuring University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67, and other faculty members in order to remind seniors of the importance of the senior gift program.
This video marks the start of the senior gift campaign, which urges graduating seniors to continue to support Harvard financially after they graduate. The donated funds are primarily used for the financial aid program, which Fitzsimmons explains is particularly important on a campus where over 70 percent of the students are on some form of financial aid.
If anything, the purpose of this video is to remind the class of 2011 why the Harvard experience is unique, and to ask for their help in ensuring that future classes enjoy the same privilege.
"This campaign is to get people to start thinking about giving back financially, maybe not now, maybe later. But we want them to reflect on the time that they spent here and the resources they had access to," said Alexandre J.C. Terrian '11, one of the senior gift co-chairs.

Chinese government officials recently detained Ai Weiwei, a popular artist and critic of the Chinese government whose latest work—a large installation called "Untitled"—is set to be unveiled at Northwest Labs next week. Police also detained friends and family members of Weiwei and performed a raid on the artist's studio. His arrest comes as just one part of what New Yorker writer Evan Rosnos deems  "the most intense crackdown on expression in years."
Weiwei's latest piece criticizes the Chinese government in the wake of the Sichuan Province earthquake of May 2008, which resulted in a disproportionately high mortality rate of schoolchildren, due in large part to poorly constructed school buildings. The piece uses 5,335 backpacks to commemorate the deceased and will be open to the public this Friday.
A profile of Ai Weiwei and his volatile history with the Chinese government can be found at The New York Times.

Looking to make it big out of Harvard? A recent study says you may be in the wrong place.
The study, which was sponsored by the University of Hawaii at Hilo and the Institute for Business and Finance Research, found out that even though Harvard University produces the most CEOs of any institution, it does not produce the wealthiest. Despite boasting 722 chief executives, Harvard alums were recorded as receiving an average of $9.4 million per year—modest in comparison to the $11.5 million average for the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford, and minuscule against the $59.2 million average of CUNY-Queens, the top earner in the survey.
Interestingly enough, when searching for correlations between education, salary, and background, Ivy League institutions showed no traceable impact in success. Although most of the CEOs with graduate degrees came from top-50 ranked schools, the best paid among postgraduates were alumni of CUNY-City, boasting an average $44.9 million salary.
Still, the results are by no means conclusive. For CUNY-Queens, the most lucrative of the bunch, the high average salary is likely due to a couple  high-earning executives skewing the statistics; it wasn't listed anywhere near the top 50 for CEO-producing schools, having only churned out less than a tenth of Harvard's executive alumni.
Similarly, Harvard's low ranking near the bottom of the top-50 wage-earning list is also likely due to its top ranking for size, with some of the more modest millionaires bringing down the average salary. It's interesting to note that the conclusions may have been different had the study compared median salaries, not averages, which may allow current Harvard students to breathe a sigh of relief.
