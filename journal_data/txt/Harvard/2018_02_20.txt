After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Placid but vibrant, composed and commanding, pop starlet Dua Lipa turned heads this past summer with the release of her carefree hit, “New Rules.” It’s clear, however, that the rising musician is unafraid of showing depth: Her most recent music video, “IDGAF,” tackles a far more insidious set of rules governing class relations in the modern age. Indeed, hidden behind Dua’s icy demeanor is a level of incisive commentary producible only by a young firebrand—an Albanian Karl Marx adorned with a single diamond earring.
Fans of Dua’s floral wardrobe and loose choreography might be surprised to find neither present in this video. Instead, the singer’s cohort of backup dancers is fitted in heavy pantsuits in a scene which is stiff, lifeless, and startlingly corporate. Closer inspection reveals that there are two groups of women who are mirror images, grafts from the same plant, separated and compartmentalized by the workings of a higher power. Who or what categorized them? It’s clear the two groups—one blue and one orange—don’t know the answer. The split proletariat circles itself ferociously, the two sides ascribing their frustrations towards the arbitrary distinctions which divide them, rather than the bright light of the capitalist engine looming above and beyond reach.
And so they begin their dance, a jerky and discombobulating mix of movements. They punch, but nothing connects. Despite their conflict, there seems to be some basis of understanding between the two groups. For all their would-be conflict, these women are not enemies.
When they reach this understanding, the orange and blue begin to swirl in what emerges as the central conceit of the video. Dua and her duplicate lie on the ground yin-yang style, their bodies joining in an abstract reconstruction of a familiar sight: She has become Tide Pod, destroyer of late-stage capitalist systems.
Unfortunately, far from becoming the cleansing force the foul, dirt-caked establishment desperately needs, Dua finds her newfound power churned and washed away. As the two groups slowly reconcile and reach understanding, the room shifts. The modular, assembly-line-like walls open up and swallow individual members. Isolated and separated, they fall back into place as cogs in the capitalist machine. The two lone Duas reunite, sharing a sisterly kiss in what appears to be knowing resignation.
The infighting over, the group reassembles and engages with the viewer. This interaction, a flagrant violation of the fourth wall, catapults the spectator into the scene. Who are we but mindless spectators, the very ones feeding this insatiable machine? In the stifling arena of the music industry, where up-and-coming stars are chewed up and spit out, one wonders whether any performer truly has agency. And so, as the dancing slows and the screen fades to black, our eyes are once again drawn to the omnipresent skylight bathing the room in its fluorescent glow.

What do albino alligators, the Los Angeles Public Library, and Harvey Weinstein have in common? They are all featured in Justin Timberlake’s “Supplies” music video. Confused? So is the content. As J.T.’s attempts at political activism play out on screen, it becomes clear that he has taken on too much too fast too soon. This music video breakdown is not one of those “celebrities should shut their mouths and stay out of things that really matter” pleas, but a respectful entreaty that they wade into the muck of political discourse tastefully. This attempt to tackle Trump, #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, gun violence, and anti-Muslim discrimination in one four-minute music video is not tasteful. Nor is it effective: Such a bombardment of content spawns comment section gems as, “WTF is doing Eiza Glez here!!! OMG she looks so flawless ! Good for Mexicans!”
To set the record straight, her name is Eiza González, and yes, she is a Mexican woman of color. But who cares what her name is or how positive for diversity the “Supplies” video could have been when she is hypocritically painted as Timberlake’s sexy lover/sidekick? She may clock a dude in the beginning, drive a fast car, and throw a torch, but a true pursuit of equality will take much more than performative support.
Timberlake first meets González in an alternate dimension where everything is white—hair, masks, police uniforms, people—except for the two leads, who pop against the frosty setting in black leather. You may be thinking: A world where you can wear hair curlers and firearm chokers in public seems quite liberating. Yet the video goes out of its way to suggest that this albino wonderland represents the whiteness of elite America—the emphasis placed on ostentatious buildings and outlandish fashion is unmistakable, even in this monochrome universe. Or perhaps the video simply calls for a daring individual to step up and change the status quo. Timberlake humbly offers himself up for the task. The use of only two colors here does not make the “Supplies” music video any easier to understand. We can only begin to imagine what will happen when the rest of the rainbow is thrown into the mayhem.
The task of keeping up becomes impossible when a blue-beanied Justin Timberlake begins to bob his head oddly before the Los Angeles Public Library, while dozens of men in black atop the building hit us with flashlight beams directly in the eyes. “Cause I got supplie-ie-ies / Supplie-ie-ies / I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies / Supplie-ie-ies,” he sings, resembling James McAvoy in “Split” (and not in a good way). In these moments, we are struck with our first profound question of the music video: What does Justin mean by “I got supplies?” Let’s take a look at what he’s “got”: “you” (us, the audience?), flashlights, books, and a hapless-looking Pharrell Williams.
Then, in the first comprehensible action of the music video, González runs through a crowd of worshippers to ignite and destroy the cause of their blind following: a glowing pyramid. Where have we seen this idea before? Maybe it calls to mind the meme of Mark Zuckerberg’s happy stroll through a sea of people wearing VR headsets? Or perhaps the we-are-all-zombies spiel of Katy Perry’s “Chained To The Rhythm.” This idea is so unoriginal that it recreates a 35-year-old commercial based on a 70-year-old book.
Our viewing experience comes to a close with Timberlake awakening in the “real” world: a barren, red landscape, featuring dust-covered children. “Just leave,” says one of them to the camera. “Die already.” After making it to the end of the “Supplies” music video? Happily.

In a shadowy back alley, a man leans against the metal rails of a balcony, awash in red neon and billowing smoke. His phone rings. He reluctantly picks it up, then shields his face with his palm, in terror of what he just heard. A subtitle appears: “MIGOS STIR FRY RESTAURANT - KOWLOON.” That’s right—the restaurant’s name is just the song’s artist and title, with “restaurant” tacked on at the end. In its first few seconds, the music video for “Stir Fry” by Migos emanates both danger and creative bankruptcy, setting the tone for what’s to come.
Inside, the members of Migos somehow operate their restaurant by smoking blunts with Pharrell Williams and betting on mahjong, a game they clearly do not understand: The process of paying out bets in Mahjong is incredibly complicated, and Migos are just throwing money on the table. After a couple painful minutes—in which Migos karate chop cinder blocks, stir noodles, and do their best to imitate every trope of a “Chinese” movie—the music video begins to take on a plot, when a rival restaurateur from the other side of Hong Kong throws a severed hand in a take-out box through the front window of Migos’ restaurant. This is just the first of several extreme spectacles that add to the absurdity of the video. While these antics make little sense, they succeed in endearing us to the video as a whole. After all, who isn’t thrilled by severed hands in take-out boxes?
Upon this provocation, Migos and two of their female bodyguards storm their competition’s restaurant, The Great Wall, to find that their third bodyguard now works for their nemesis. The music cuts, and a two minute kung fu showdown begins. While this battle sees Migos triumph, the defeat of their rivals is not enough: The music video ends with the bodyguards preparing to cut out the tongue of their duplicitous former comrade, yet another of the absurdities that make the video so compelling.
This music video feels like an ill-conceived imitation of many classic American kung fu movies, from “Big Trouble in Little China” to “Bloodsport.” All it shares with them is a misunderstanding of the actual practice of gong fu (功夫) and a reliance on stereotypical Chinese culture: The video, much like its predecessors, depicts gong fu as a violent form of combat, when in reality, the practice is mostly focused on self improvement and discipline. While it may be easy to dismiss this appropriation as Migos’ genuine desire to partake in a greater cultural dialogue with the East, if that is truly the case, then Migos has done an abysmal job. The fight choreography is laughably poor, the laissez-faire use of Chinese cultural items is overdone, and the concept of the video itself depends on outdated stereotypes.
Cultural appropriation aside, “Stir Fry” is one of the most bizarre and poorly acted music videos in recent memory—which makes it a surprising source of comedy. In one memorably stilted moment before the final kung fu showdown, Quavo snarls, “Time to go to sleep.” At this line, which would seem like a low effort threat, Quavo trembles and looks awkwardly at the camera, betraying a clear lack of acting chops. This line is much like the rest of the music video: flawed and awkward, but enjoyable in its absurdity. Reminiscent of Tommy Wiseau's “The Room” in its nonsensical story and wooden acting, “Stir Fry” is delightful in its badness. Although Migos may have fallen short of an artistic statement, a coherent plot, and even an inoffensive video, they have succeeded in producing a visual spectacle that is, if nothing else, entertaining.

Here’s the thing: Political satire—when it’s good—is the best. “The Onion” is hilarious, and so is “Veep.” “Saturday Night Live” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” are some of the sharpest political commentaries around. Satire serves a purpose—it makes news accessible, and it’s funny, and it’s the only media source so perfectly designed to wed the two.
Here’s something else: Donald Trump is inherently hilarious. It’s just a fact. For your average liberal, Trump all but writes his own jokes. In theory, our current political moment should be a godsend for the genre. How hard could it be to type up what he already does and slap a cover on it?
The answer, evidently, is “not hard enough.” For the past few years, bookstores have been steadily accruing Trump satire, and most of it is worrisomely bad. Think “A Child's Book of Trump,” or “Win Bigly.” None of these books received stellar reviews from major media establishments. Slate’s take on Alec Baldwin’s “You Can’t Spell America Without Me,” titled “Bad Impression,” speaks to comedy’s broader malaise. As Slate writer Jason Zinoman suggests, the current efforts are too one-dimensional, all the same fluffy take on a bizarre, serious topic.
It doesn’t take a careful analysis of Baldwin’s book to draw the same conclusion. The first page of “You Can’t Spell America” reads, “It was in January 1986, the day the space shuttle blew up, so tragic, but I was in a fabulous mood. My first casino in Atlantic City was doing unbelievably great.” That’s how Baldwin’s Trump goes—too many commas, à la the President’s tweets, and no deeper joke than the President’s blind selfishness and crass mannerisms. Hillary Clinton was right to ask: “What happened?” When liberal America needs a nervous laugh more than ever, why can’t it get one?
The obvious answer—and the right one—is that Donald Trump is too extreme to be rotely parodied. He takes something superficially funny (the bluster, the hair) and makes it deadly serious. One year in, and he’s clearly not joking.
Comedy has struggled hugely (or “yugely,” as the case may be) to speak to both aspects of the Trump phenomenon. Usually, modern Trump comedy errs on the side of easy humor with a touch of desperation. “You Can’t Spell America Without Me” dubs itself a “so-called parody,” and the blurb for “A Child’s Book of Trump” says the book “would be hysterical if it wasn’t so true.” But the problem with cheap laughs is that they’re just not that funny. A year ago, Stephen Colbert aired a sketch comparing Trump jokes to Oreos: delicious, tempting, and decidedly unhealthy. Gross caricatures of Trump are only interesting for their shock value and palatability. Neither are four-year commodities. Both are now being stretched beyond their potential.
In the short term, however, Trump comedy still sells beautifully. Modern presidential humor is mostly superficial, and though it’s never very funny, people are going to keep buying it. It’s capitalistic. It’s cathartic.
So, what the hell happened? Authentic satire is hard, and the current strategy (Colbert’s Oreos) is so easy. In the White House and the comedy section alike, the only real solution is to wait it out.

In her incredibly thought-provoking memoir, “Educated,” Tara Westover describes a life that is different from the usual American childhood experience. She “had grown up preparing for the Days of Abomination, watching for the sun to darken, for the moon to drip as if with blood,” her parents spending little time preparing Westover and her six other siblings for the world outside of their hometown in Buck’s Peak, Idaho. After years of working in a scrap yard with her father and older brothers, Westover takes the ACT that will eventually lead her to Brigham Young University, Cambridge College, and Harvard. Westover questions the doctrines her family has instilled in her since birth, the reliability of memory, and the obligations a daughter has to her family. Written with great clarity, “Educated” provides a perspective that forces readers to consider the privileges they enjoy thanks to their education.
Westover’s father is a staunch Mormon that believes the government and the “Medical Establishment”—which includes any hospital or formally trained doctors—will lead to the downfall of civilization. Her mother is an herbalist who makes home remedies, and none of the children are permitted to go to a doctor or hospital. To the average American this might seem radical, but it isn’t until Westover is an adult that she begins to rethink the ideas she was raised to believe. In college, she takes an Advil instead of a tincture for an earache and can’t “comprehend [the pain’s] absence.” But more than anything, her distrust of medical establishments makes it especially difficult for her to seek counselling even in the most stressful of times, a key issue for the second half of the memoir.
“But [her] father had taught [her] that there are not two reasonable opinions to be had on any subject: there is Truth and there are Lies.” A traditional American public education usually facilitates discussion by implementing methods like Socratic Seminars, in which a teacher asks questions that students are encouraged to think through. However, Westover was not granted such liberties in her upbringing. Instead, her mother attempted to homeschool Westover and her siblings—a task that soon fell to the wayside early on, leaving Westover with nothing more than the ability to understand basic math and reading comprehension. It is not until her late teens that she teaches herself algebra, among other skills, in order to pass the ACT. Her unfamiliarity with original thought is an obstacle Westover must overcome when she arrives at college, and the juxtaposition between Westover and her classmates highlights the privilege their education allotted them in terms of having the agency to think for oneself.
Similarly, Westover has had no exposure to basic facts of history before arriving at BYU. For example, she tries to read Victor Hugo’s “Les Misérables” but she “was unable to distinguish between the fictional story and the factual backdrop. Napoleon felt no more real to [her] than Jean Valjean. [She] had never heard of either.” Westover is forced to self-teach knowledge that most people take for granted and is too embarrassed to admit what she doesn’t know. She is by no means stupid, but growing up not having access to information makes her appear unintelligent to her peers. Rather than belittle Westover, these interactions highlight how people quickly judge the intelligence of others without taking into account an individual’s background and divergent levels of education.
Perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of the memoir is Westover’s admittance to memory’s unreliability. In a form that relies heavily on memories, it is important that their malleability is accounted for. Occasionally, Westover includes a footnote that explains that what she has written is what she remembers, but it differs from what each of her brothers claim happened. In other moments, Westover uses diary entries to compare how she felt directly after an intense moment to how she now views the episode. Her active introspection highlights the ability for people to change, but also forces the reader to think about how Westover’s experiences between then and now have shaped her. She also explains habitual behaviors through specific retellings. For example, instead of stating that her father believes the government has ties to the Illuminati, she recalls “one lunch in particular.” Westover chooses these moments for the strength of the statement they make, and this in turn makes her memoir more potent. Overall, her transparency about the untrustworthy nature of memories solidifies rather than undermines Westover as a storyteller.
The memoir format can easily lend itself to casual, if unintentional bragging on the author’s part: Westover received a PhD despite never stepping foot into a classroom until she attended BYU. However, this book is less a self-congratulation and more a cathartic expression of her struggles. While Westover has clearly worked hard to achieve so much, she is not afraid to tell on herself. She admits that at one point she “was so far behind in [her] work that, pausing one night to begin a new episode of “Breaking Bad,” [she] realized that [she] might fail [her] PhD.” The message is not that hard work pays off but rather that even those who work hard have difficult days. These episodes make Westover no less incredible for her successes but do make her feel more human and less larger-than-life.
Westover humbly describes her struggle with Mormonism, family relationships, abuse, and education in a memoir that questions the readers’ perception of education. It is honest, admitting to the fallibility of memory. In this truth comes strength. “Educated” is so much more than a memoir about a woman who graduated college without a formal education. It is about a woman who must learn how to learn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What is it like to grow up transgender with a schizophrenic single mother? That’s the question that Clyde Petersen tries to answer in his recent film, “Torrey Pines.” The transgender filmmaker, animator, and musician creates what he calls “a queer punk coming-of-age tale” based on his personal story. Since its release in 2016, Petersen’s film has been screened all over the world, from Norway to Japan.  It arrived at Emerson Paramount Center’s Jack Liebergott Black Box on Feb. 14 for a special one-week screening. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Petersen to chat about his work, LGBTQ representation, and “Torrey Pines” itself.
The Harvard Crimson: In recent years, we’ve seen an explosion in the production of LGBT-themed films and TV shows. Do you feel that audiences today are more interested in nuanced portrayals of LGBT characters?
Clyde Petersen: Oh, yes, for sure. Generally speaking, I think that all audiences are ready for more nuanced characters, beyond portrayals of caricatures and stereotypes. I think that everyone is thirsty for that. The situation that we have now in Hollywood is pretty bleak. Most films just reiterate stereotypes and portraitures of queer people, people of color, and women. I think it’s great to see all of those marginalized communities making films that represent themselves. There are so many stories about gender in the world. I think that every story is a story about gender, but [films nowadays] mostly emphasize the common thread of what a man is and what a woman is in our culture. It would be good to see some other stories out there, because everyone struggles with gender in some way, whether they identify [with] that or not.
THC: A major theme in “Torrey Pines” is mental health. How did you approach such a sensitive topic?
CP: I grew up with my mom, who was schizophrenic. The way the film came about was that I wrote a song about it with my friend, Kimya Dawson, and a lot of people were responding to it in many ways, like talking about their families and telling stories about mental health and growing up queer. So that’s how it unfolded over time to become a film. And I feel like we definitely see an explosion of discussion of mental health. Over the last 10 or 15 years it has become a real conversation, which is exciting. I’m excited to be a tiny part of that. And I definitely wouldn’t have had the same understanding of it if I hadn’t experienced it growing up with my mom.
THC: “Torrey Pines” is your directorial debut. How different was it from your work on short films in the past?
CP: It was incredible. It took three years and I had seven interns and an employee. We actually made it in my bedroom, which was really ridiculous, but cost efficient. It was an incredibly exciting experience, full of the day-to-day work of taking one picture at a time. It was different from working on short films because I can make a short film in a couple of weeks. I usually work by myself or with one collaborator. Here I had eight.
THC: “Torrey Pines” has a special theatrical version, the same one being performed at Emerson, with its score being performed by a live band. Where does this idea come from?
CP: I love watching films with a live score. It’s so fun. It’s not uncommon for old films to have them, but I’ve seen a couple of new ones over the years. It’s one of my favorite experiences. I was excited to be able to do that with this film. My band, Your Heart Breaks, made the soundtrack for the film so it was easy for us to transition to that. I’d say that “Torrey Pines” is 50 percent music and 50 percent not. And we received a grant, touring grant, so that was how we were really able to do it. We’ve been touring all over the world. We’ve just got back from Japan, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway. We’ve been on tour for two years. This is our last one, I think, unless something comes up. 
THC: You are based in Seattle. What is it like to make movies outside the bubble of New York and Los Angeles? Do you think it influences the film itself?
CP: It’s so fun, I just love it. I think it’s easier to tell alternative stories outside of Los Angeles. Seattle has an incredible filmmaking scene, full of independent animators and live-action filmmakers. The support here is really strong. People really support each other, because they recognize that we don’t have the same studio system. So I think the film had a lot of freedom to be whatever it wanted to be, without the constraints of capitalism.
THC: What about future projects? Are you working on anything at the moment?
CP: I’m working on a live-action feature. It’s a documentary about a band from Seattle called Earth. It’s kind of a heavy metal drone band. They’ve been around for years, but I finally found the space to make a film about them.
THC: It seems like you’re primarily interested in making documentaries, or at least films that examines the line between nonfiction and fiction.
CP: I studied documentary filmmaking in college. I kind of flip back and forth between kind of documentary stuff and animation. And I do animation for documentaries. But what I’m interested in is documenting things in general. So whatever format that takes—audio, video, animation... I’m interested in documenting history.

The nerdy high school freshman kids in audiovisual (A/V) club, the theme of unrequited love, and introverts stepping out of their comfort zones could be in any ‘90s, coming-of-age movie or TV show, and “Everything Sucks!” is no exception. But the Netflix original takes all of these familiar tropes and exaggerates them to comedic effect, altering them to sidestep expectations.
The show centers on Luke (Jahi Di’Allo Winston), a freshman A/V club enthusiast, and Kate (Peyton Kennedy), a taciturn sophomore, also in the A/V club, who both live in the town of Boring, Oregon. Luke and Kate’s relationship is the first and primary way that the show manages to take a staple of the genre—the nerdy romance—and turn it on its head. Luke’s romantic interest in Kate is near-instant, but complications arise as Kate comes to terms with the fact that she is gay. The imbalance in their attraction to each other creates a series of miscommunications, leaving Luke upset that his romantic gestures (including a spoof of Oasis’s “Wonderwall”music video) have not been met with enthusiasm, and Kate struggling to not hurt Luke’s feelings. Rather than the classic “boy-chases-girl” storyline, “Everything Sucks!” strives to be something more, and creates beautiful, complex character relationships in result.
Running parallel to the main love story is a relationship between Luke’s mother, Sherry (Claudine Mboligikpelani Nako), and Kate’s father, Ken (Patch Darragh), who is also the principal of their high school. On the surface, these simultaneous relationships appear to be another factor meant solely to complicate Luke and Kate’s lives. However, Sherry’s and Ken’s relationship takes on an unexpected life of its own. Ken is a buttoned–down type of man: kind, but awkward and by the book. Sherry is more easy-going and sociable, evidenced by her relationship with Luke, which more closely resembles a friendship than traditional parenting. With Sherry’s help, Ken starts to come out of his shell, and the two embark on their own coming-of-age story, despite being adults. Ken teepees his ex-girlfriend’s house and smokes weed for the first time, while both of them try to overcome the pain of losing their departed spouses.
Both the cinematography and soundtrack of the show reinforce its themes. Most of the shots, even those involving camera pans and tilts, are handheld, creating a slight shakiness. Director of photography Elisha Christian also frequently makes use of the quick zoom, like those used in home videos. The shakiness and sudden zooms create the feeling of an A/V club video without feeling amateur. The soundtrack establishes the tone and setting of the show almost exclusively ’90s songs, including the aforementioned “Wonderwall” by Oasis, “Fire Water Burn” by The Bloodhound Gang, and “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” by Deep Blue Something. At times, the music directly relates to the onscreen events, such as when Kate reveals she is a lesbian to Luke and the line “I’m dumb, she’s a lesbian / I thought I had found the one” plays from Weezer’s “Pink Triangle”.
The cast of characters covers many other archetypes of the genre: Oliver (Elijah Stevenson), the overly dramatic theater king; Emaline (Sydney Sweeney), Oliver’s girlfriend and the most popular girl at the school; McQuaid (Rio Mangini), the cynical super nerd; Tyler (Quinn Liebling), the stupid but innocent freshman. However, the show manages to successfully develop all of these characters by throwing them through an emotional wringer. In the end, all of the characters embody their archetype, but also appear genuine in their relationships with each other. By focusing on the bonds between characters, “Everything Sucks!” manages to combine a clear nostalgia trip with characters for whom viewers end up cheering.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her new novel “The Immortalists,” Chloe Benjamin brings to life four siblings—who learn the dates of their deaths from a fortune teller—to explore what life means when it is given an expiration date. Some of the siblings die young, while others live to the ripe age of 88, but along the way it is clear that it is the content rather than the number of years that determine a life well-lived. Told through each siblings’ eyes, in the order in which they die, the earlier parts of the book are packed with action and intense emotion while the final chapters are a slow burn. Although the narrative declines in excitement, the later sections of the book allow for Benjamin’s philosophy on life to sink in.
The novel begins strangely, describing “the dark patch of fur” between a 13-year-old’s legs before discussing her “waist length and medium brown hair.” Further talk of “palm-sized” breasts and “nipples dime sized” indicate that this novel might mention uncomfortable topics. Benjamin dedicates the first section to the youngest child, Simon, who moves to San Francisco before finishing high school to escape his mother and explore his sexuality in a community where LGBT identity is widely accepted. Here, Benjamin continues her use of sexualized language, as Simon sees “a king of a cock.” However, the diction in this section seems more appropriate. What seemed unnecessary in a scene about four siblings bonding makes sense for a young man trying to understand his sexuality and place in the world. After Simon’s section, this stylized language disappears. The highly-charged sexuality seems misplaced in the general introduction, but is well suited for Simon’s section.
Though the four Gold children examined together are a case study on the value of content versus longevity of a life, each individual narrative explores topics outside of this eternal question. For instance, Simon lives in San Francisco during the early 1980s at the start of the AIDS crisis. As Simon struggles with the new, harsher stigma forced onto his sexuality, he begins to understand how his black partner feels as a minority: “Simon can conceal his sexuality. Robert can’t conceal his blackness.” Benjamin does not spend too much time on this topic—a brief argument between Robert and Simon, and a few stray thoughts of Simon’s briefly highlight the complexity of their intersectional relationship—but it is enough to make a reader pause and think. Other such issues include the role of magic in our lives, the humanity—or lack thereof—of sending healthy men to war, and how much happiness humans should sacrifice in order to live longer. In what could have become an overwhelming melting pot of hot topics, Benjamin creates a splendid blend of thought-provoking narratives.
The first section is filled to the brim with Simon’s exciting life: learning to dance, falling in love, working at a nightclub. The second, Klara’s, features magic tricks and Las Vegas lights. But the two older siblings, Varya and Daniel, live much more mundane lives and carry remorse and regret for all the things they never said to their dead siblings. Varya lives with “no room for anyone else’s pain” even though her fortune predicted a long life. As events slowly unfold, the unhappiness of lives not lived to their potential seeps through to the reader. The lull in action doesn’t induce sleepiness, which it easily could, but rather awakens the mind to deep, philosophical questions about the meaning of life.
“The Immortalists” asks questions whose answers could—and should—affect a reader's life. It is a thought-provoking novel resituates culturally and historically significant phenomena, from the AIDS epidemic to the military in a post-9/11 world. Although the first few lines set the book off to a rocky start, the incredible pacing and thought-provoking themes prove that Benjamin’s latest work is a worthwhile read.

While the producers of “Queer Eye” stated that the show’s purpose is “to turn Red States pink”, the show accomplishes far more than that. The show emphasizes our commonality and reaffirms that, despite the divisions of today, we are all human. Although “Queer Eye” follows the basic structure of makeover reality television, the true and raw connection between the Fab Five and the people they help make it stand out from the crowd.
In this 2018 Netflix revival, the “Fab Five,” a group of five gay men specializing in design (Bobby Berk), culture (Karamo Brown), fashion (Tan France), food and wine (Antoni Porowski), and grooming (Jonathan van Ness) leave New York for Georgia, where they set out to refine the lives of local men. At first look, the show isn’t all that special. Makeovers have become a staple of reality television with shows like “Fixer Upper,” “Hotel Impossible,” and the show’s 2003 Bravo precursor, “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.” The every-episode makeovers quickly become tedious and unoriginal, especially in housing design. However, what will push TV watchers through the season binge are the human stories behind the makeover.
A show about five New York gay men in Georgia could have gone awry in a number of ways, but instead the show eschews divisiveness and teaches us about our commonalities. The Fab Five learns from their Georgia clients. In turn, their Georgia clients learn about LGBT issues, and the audience reconsiders their preconceptions in the process. The personalities of the Fab Five are essential in accomplishing this. In addition to being comical and having great chemistry together, the group doesn’t try to impose their styles on the people. Instead, they encourage them to find their own styles and be comfort able within their own bodies. Describing one man’s post-makeover appearance in the pilot episode, Tan remarks, “This is how we found him, he’s just refined.” Refining—instead of redesigning—clients results in mutual understanding and bonding. Seeing Tan bond with Neil in Episode Two over being raised by a South Asian family, and Karamo and Antoni give advice on coming out and living authentically as a black, gay, and rather un-flamboyant man in Episode Four are some of the most emotionally evocative moments in the season.
While the Fab Five don’t press their style choices onto their clients, they aren’t afraid to address stereotypes and stigma. Their willingness to call out phrases that grate on every gay person’s ears—like “Who’s the man, and who’s the woman?”—discuss the intersection of homosexuality with race and religion, and talk about how the Black Lives Matter movement create situations with palpable tension and encourage real discussion. It’s clear after a few episodes that these conversations are planned, and at times they feel scripted and overplayed. Still, taken together, they are really moving scenes.
The Fab Five don’t just give to Georgia—they learn from the state as well. Leaving the gilded bustle of the city for the more down-to-earth rural counties, they find people like Bobby in Episode Five who works two jobs on two hours of sleep to provide for his wife and six kids. They find Jeremy, a firefighter, who wants to look his best for a fundraiser for the training of rural firefighters. They realize that rural values don’t drastically differ from their own. “Queer Eye” attempts to bridge a divide by bringing the Fab Five to Georgia, but the stories of the Georgians themselves fight against stereotypes of the state as an uncompassionate conservative, homophobic monolith.
In the end “Queer Eye” reminds us that we are all human. The feelings of being left behind, of being “ugly,” of being undeserving of the attention that lead people to call the Fab Five for help are universal. Like Bobby says at the end of the pilot, “A common thread that holds every human together is that we all just want to be loved.” So maybe, turning red states pink is not the best summarization of “Queer Eye.” A better symbol would be the name change from “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” to “Queer Eye.” The show isn’t just for straight people or gay people or conservatives or liberals. It’s a universal call for anyone just wanting to feel love.

I tell Audrey a story on the way home, the usual one, about when we were little. Back then, she’d cry over the silliest things: smushed flies, roadkill, belly-up carnival goldfish. One day, I recount, she found a mangled feather boa on the sidewalk and mourned it too. My mother thought it was awfully white of her, inventing tragedy where none existed. Her dumb little gweilo daughter, pampered and hungry for problems.
“Funny how I’m the one who ended up vegetarian,” I say, but Audrey doesn’t laugh, just unlocks the front door and then closes it behind us, her expression inscrutable. I wonder if it’s because I’m leaving tomorrow, for the first time since the last time. If I had a sister like me, I wouldn’t miss her much. But Audrey is kinder than I am, more forgiving.
“Did you pack your concealer?” she asks. We’ve reached my room now, and she is searching through my makeup bag. “You should have one for blemishes and one for under-eye circles.” She is 14 but already beautiful, a double-edged quality in a girl so young. She colors herself in perfectly every morning. It was she who taught me to draw shadows on my face to distract from its increasing sphericity. My mother never comments on Audrey’s handiwork except when the powders smudge. You look dirty, she says. Like a cheap whore.
I nod. “Yep, the Almay and the Neutrogena.”
“And primer, too,” Audrey adds. “Don’t forget that.”
At the peak of my success, I was cruel to her. I was desperate, then, for reassurance. I sought safety in myself, in the protrusion of vertebrae, in the growth of fine pigmentless fur that spread over my skin—any palpable proof of purity. But I needed more, I needed a frame of reference, and there she was, silent and pliant as always.
“Close your eyes,” she says, and takes to curling my lashes, which resist beauty, which even now are sparse and fragile. A few casualties land atop my cheeks. She brushes them off and murmurs an apology.
It was so easy, even at that stage, to push her into the bathroom, force her onto the scale, measure the inches of her pre-adolescent body. It was my favorite game: Are You Smaller Than a Sixth Grader?
And somehow, when I met my ineluctable fate a few months later, she had found it in herself to dust my resentful intubated face with blush. How clownish I’d looked, thick paint on sallow canvas. She hadn’t been so skilled back then, it was guesswork, reverse engineering. Now she is like a doctor with those brushes, those palettes, her expert hands exacting and incapable of failure. The girl she presents to me in a hand mirror betrays no trace of her nasogastric past.
“You’ll call me every day, right?”
“Every week,” I say.
She holds the mirror at arm’s length so that we both can fit inside it. “We look like we have different parents,” she says, and she presses her tanned, dimpled cheek to my pale one. “We look like different races.” I turn and blink against her face, tickling her forehead with my matted lashes. True to form, our laughs look nothing alike.
As a final touch, she takes a tweezer to my brows, pulling the skin taut to minimize pain.
Many years earlier, when still I was indifferent to my roundness, I had made a game of dropping my possessions from our bedroom window and listening for the sound of small objects hitting concrete—the light affirmative clatter that marked the turn from cause to effect.
I wish she’d hurt me just a little.
I wish she’d show some sign.

The video compiler for “The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale” needs to be given a large bonus for being the sole saving grace in the otherwise lousy production of this new Netflix comedy show. The Sunday series premiere is remarkable for its hilarious reel of video clips, frequent marketing-gambit cameos, mixed in with lackluster comedy from Joel McHale, who makes jokes that don’t land. The potential of the show to be a topical series is undermined by shoddy, unfunny writing.
After his success with E!’s “The Soup” and NBC’s “Community,” Joel McHale is now on Netflix. His weekly series attempts at comedic commentary on global pop culture by reviewing popular video clips of the week from reality shows like “The Bachelor” and “Love & Hip Hop,” as well as Korean TV dramas and viral videos. There are also frequent cameos from celebrities. In the pilot, Kevin Hart, Jodie Sweetin, and Jason Priestley, among others, make appearances. The show is set up for success. With great video selection and a proven comedian as its host, the pilot could have been a strong start to a high-rated topical comedy series. Instead, it is a flop.
The principle problem of the pilot is its writing: the show has an issue with pacing and structure. McHale starts telling bad jokes from minute one until minute 27, and there is no strong beginning or ending to the pilot. While strong structures aren’t expected for comedy week-in-reviews, there is an expectation for some variation and structure. This show lacks both of these features. The jokes mostly fail to land. They rely on the celebrity of McHale and his cameo stars but do not tailor the jokes to these celebrities’ personality. Instead of the star actually making the joke funny, it feels as if the stars are trying to make the most out of a bad script.
The cameos feel random, and, because of the given material, unfunny. The comedy game may be off, but the marketing game is given full attention. The celebrities never miss a chance to plug their new television shows or events, cheapening the experience. Despite the show’s attempt to cast this constant plugging as a joke, it clearly comes off as a marketing ploy.
What results from poor writing and incessant marketing are scenes like McHale’s tour of Netflix. The scene  is chock full of show plugs like “GLOW,” “Beyond Stranger Things,” and “Fuller House,” but is lacking in comedy and content. It appears that the writers think the zenith of comedy is Mike Colter running a jar opening stand, Paul Reiser entering the Upside Down (an alternate dimension within the world of “Stranger Things”) to get gluten-free upside-down muffins, and Joel McHale just… walking around. This five-minute “tour” has the quality of a daytime television promotional.
The pilot of “The Joel McHale Show” doesn’t leave a lot of excitement for the rest of the comedy series. Despite its potential to be both global and topical, the pilot falls flat, mainly due to a bad writing team. The combination of uninspired writing and the constant barrage of marketing for other shows prompts viewers to hit the back button and seeing what else is on (maybe check out “GLOW” or “Beyond Stranger Things?”), but the videos will keep you watching. The clips are pure genius and elicit audible laughs when McHale’s commentary won’t. The global reach of the clips create diverse pop culture compilations that you can’t find on your own. There’s still hope that the show’s writing team will get better or get replaced, but for now, instead of hitting the back button, why not hit fast-forward and skip through McHale’s dry commentary to get to the viral videos?

On the fifth day, I took out a scrap of paper and wrote down all the thoughts in my head:
1. The limbo between fantasy and reality. The violence that fantasy inflicts upon reality—That’s what I shall explore (as an individual and as an artist).
2. Neither happy nor sad, neither passionate nor cold—the feeling that I sometimes explain to people as daydreaming but is really more like dreamless sleep: It makes me feel like a container holding a secret that I’ll never understand.
3. Film idea: A man stops speaking, because he doesn’t know what he really wants to say and who he wants to say it to. After twenty years he breaks the silence (Why now?).
4. Another film idea: A girl wakes up and realizes the door of her room has disappeared. In complete solitude, she ponders (What does she do?).
I read the list twice, added a fifth item, and crossed it out. Then I thought about “Neon Genesis Evangelion,” an anime I watched when I was 12, in which giant robots fight mysterious monsters that try to destroy our world. The protagonist is a 14-year-old boy, one of the few gifted teens who can operate the robots. He is sensitive and averse to violence, and fighting leaves him with deep trauma, but he has to continue because humanity is counting on him to defeat the monsters. By the end of the story, he has achieved the power to decide the fate of the world. Depressed, disillusioned, and disheartened by his failed attempts at forming relationships, he chooses to destroy everything and everyone. Halfway through the destruction, he realizes that he can’t let go of the people he loves, even after they have hurt him. So he stops, and he and the girl he loves are left alone, the last humans on the planet.
I realized that all of my filmic preferences and explorations could be traced back to this anime. The intense, destructive romanticism that I relished in Jean-Luc Godard and Leos Carax, the aestheticization of isolation that I admired in Wong Kar-wai and Chantal Akerman, and even the blending of subjective and objective reality I saw in Andrei Tarkovsky are all things I first experienced watching “Evangelion” ten years ago. I was 22 now, but nothing had changed.
I wondered if I should go to Social Room. Maybe there would be 100 other guys she had picked up at Vietnamese restaurants. Maybe I’d spend the night pretending that the reason I was standing by myself was that I was too cool to talk to people. I stared at the fan on the ceiling. What the hell, I would just get drunk beforehand, and I wouldn’t care about any of that.
I did go, and I did go drunk. The club was literally a studio room in an apartment building off of Lan Kwai Fong, but there was great techno. When I walked in, she immediately saw me and introduced me to her group as an artist friend. It turned out that they were all friends with the DJ. The blue lights in the club were flashing intensely. I said that I loved this DJ’s music, and she suggested we all shut the fuck up and go dance.
On the dance floor I started to really consider her appearance for the first time. Her sparkling grey dress flew in space while she danced effortlessly. She made sure to engage both of her male friends. I guessed that she was one of those people who works at a big corporation but knows a lot about the underground club scene. I started twirling my head aggressively. I was jumping around more than I was dancing. The alcohol made me warm, and I felt I had enough energy to fill the room, so I just did whatever I felt like doing. She looked at me with encouragement, and her friends were cheering. They were all very nice people. I bounced back and forth, sometimes into them. The trippy projection behind the stage had become a blur, and the techno was pounding hard. I realized I still didn’t even know her name.
At 3 AM we all took the death bus back to Mong Kok. Death buses are night-time vehicles that tremble hard and run across the city like San Fermin bulls. They get their name from their adrenaline-producing sharp turns and reckless speeds. Due to public safety concerns, the government mandated speed meters that would beep if the shuttles’ speeds exceeded 80 kilometers, so that passengers could report drivers who topped this limit. But nobody wanted to sacrifice convenience for safety, so the only result was the addition of continuous beeping to the incessant trembling. As we beeped through the tunnel across Victoria Harbour, she told me her name was Kwan Yin.
“Like the Buddha,” she said.
I watched her lips move, and imagined how they would change shape if I pressed mine against them. I imagined feeling the weight and warmth of her body in my arms, and in my mind I saw my arms move through the trajectories that would make that happen. She was still talking to me, now about another club. I decided to continue to indulge my imagination, discretely and silently. It is incredible how two people can sit side by side and each have no clue what is on the other’s mind.

On Feb. 12, Tayari Jones, novelist and Professor at Rutgers University’s MFA program in Newark, cast spells over a crowd squeezed into the Harvard Bookstore. In town for the bookstore’s popular author series, Jones discussed her latest novel, “An American Marriage,” with Christina Sharpe, Professor of English at Tufts University and author of “In the Wake: On Blackness and Being” and “Monstrous Intimacies: Making Post-Slavery Subjects.” Jones, effortlessly charming throughout the talk, began the event by recounting the surreal experience of having Oprah call her car phone to welcome “An American Marriage” into Winfrey’s 2018 Book Club. As the crowd’s laughter slowly melted away, Jones introduced her book, making sure to let her audience know that she would tiptoe around potential spoilers.
Set in the city of Atlanta, the novel narrates the story of Celestial, a woman separated for twelve long years from her wrongfully imprisoned husband, Roy. Written with lyrical grace, the story charts the aftermath of Roy’s incarceration, Celestial’s brave onward march, and the nuanced, complex experiences of Black America. For Jones, however, the novel is much more than an attempt at captivating fiction or an isolated commentary on race. Her book explores the intersection of race, society, and gender, and asks its readers to consider the disparity in expectations for married men and women. Jones’ novel sets out to note the importance of perseverance in the face of drawbacks, and to encourage such courageous perseverance regardless of gender or race.
The conversation shifted seamlessly between topics, lingering on moments of sparkling wit and touching emotion as Jones tackled Sharpe’s questions. Over the course of the discussion, Jones managed to engage a particularly interactive audience. She noted that this book first came into being at the Radcliffe Institute, where she was a fellow from 2011 to 2012, and inched onwards at a measured pace. Jones spoke of a time when, after spending one year on the last 50 pages of the novel, she had decided that there was nothing more she could do. Eventually, however, the author was able to craft an ending that she believed offered calculated responses to the questions of humanity, of liberty, of freedom that lurked between the lines of her moving book. Her book was an exercise in the strength of the individual—what a single person is capable of and what it means to pursue those capabilities.
She continued, defending Celestial’s refusal to put her life on hold and suffer because her husband was wrongfully incarcerated. Jones observed that empowerment shouldn’t always require the downfall of an oppressive patriarchal figure, but rather that a woman’s empowerment should also lie solely in her decision to move beyond tragedy. Through her novel, Jones asks a major question: Would it be fair to condemn Celestial’s eventual happiness just because her husband, a good man, was victim to the racial biases of America’s judicial system? She spoke with genuine passion, and this passion translated to greater clarity as she continued to challenge the notion that “the best thing a woman can do is serve her man.”
Standing in line to receive a signed copy of Jones’ book were two classmates from the author’s time at Spelman College: Gretchen Cook-Anderson, a Director at IES Abroad, and Shirley Greene, Associate Dean of Students at the Harvard Summer School. “I’ve known her for years, so to actually see this come to fruition is absolutely wonderful,” Greene said.  Cooke-Anderson added, “She’s already an established writer, but this new book has reached a certain pinnacle and has really elevated the voice of women writers.”
“While I haven’t read this book, I came because I’d heard about Tayari Jones. I’m excited to read it and about her new approach to writing [about] marriage!” Camara Brown, a PhD student in the American Studies program, said.

On Feb. 12, Tavi Gevinson stopped by the Cambridge Public Library to talk about her new book, “Rookie on Love.” Gevinson is a fashion blogger, magazine editor, actress, and author. Between the ages of 12 and 15, she gained international popularity for her online fashion blog, “Style Rookie.” Now, she edits the online magazine, “Rookie,” and is currently promoting her new novel, “Rookie on Love.” She has made Forbes’ “30 Under 30 in Media” list twice. “Rookie on Love” is an anthology, edited by Gevinson, with many contributing writers, including Jenny Zhang, John Green, and Alessia Cara. The book explores the trials of love from the points of view of the contributing writers.
Gevinson is a role model to many young girls due to her success and involvement in the fashion industry. During the event, she portrayed herself as a normal human being—someone who tells the truth about her life and speaks her thoughts. She shared herself with her audience, and her audience seemed to respect and understand her more deeply as a result. Gevinson used direct and unveiled dialogue, speaking to the audience as she would speak to a family member. While maintaining her complex ideas and thoughts, she did not attempt to organize them for any specific purpose.
For much of the event, Gevinson read snippets of pieces she was currently writing. She talked about her experiences as an actress, her struggles in relationships, her thoughts on people and the world, among other things.
Gevinson began the talk simply by saying about her book: “It’s about love, and what it’s like to look at someone and actually see them.” She leapt into narratives about plays she’d acted in, relationships she’d been in, and strange friendships she’d been confused by.
“He told me I was a fantasy. I told him the problem with calling someone a fantasy is that a fantasy isn’t true.” Gevinson explored the emotional depths of difficulties she had experienced in her relationships. She took the audience through her thought process, yet she didn’t attempt to make herself sound like a guru, and refused to sugarcoat when it came to personal anecdotes. “I’m going to break his heart.” She openly admitted to mistakes she had made and lessons she had learned.
Perhaps that is why she has received so much critical attention—she presents herself as a normal person whom other people listen to. She tells the world what she thinks, simply because she thinks a lot about her life and her choices, making people gravitate towards her. Gevinson doesn’t seem to have any other agenda, except wanting to share herself with the world.
The degree to which Gevinson affects young girls became increasingly evident with the audience reactions. “She’s really inspirational, how she did so much when she was so young,” Zoe R. Fritz-Sherman, an attendee of the event, said.
“I just like to hear her talk,” Olga K. Joseph said. Joseph has been following Gevinson for eight years. She’s read Rookie Mag, Gevinson’s books, and more. Gevinson’s stream-of-consciousness-like way of writing seems to affect all around her.
“Just being a strong, unapologetic presence is always helpful,” Sara R. Siegel, another attendee, said. “I hope that girls and boys have more outlets for seeing different ways that people can be in the world.”

Laura Lippman’s recently released crime thriller “Sunburn” is at times brilliant and at times unintentionally hilarious. Polly, the novel’s protagonist, ditches her lackluster husband and ends up a bar in a sleepy Delaware town. There, she meets Adam, a PI who has been tailing her, trying to gather intel on her whereabouts. Soon, Adam and Polly begin a torrid love affair, and Adam has to decide whether to stay on the job or come clean to Polly. Polly is not without her secrets either, and in this environment of deceit, someone dies.
Undoubtedly, “Sunburn” presents an enticing story full of intrigue and suspense. The novel’s last 100 pages fly by as the lies unravel and the truth is revealed. Lippman constructs an undeniably interesting closing act, but this achievement is tampered by a clumsily written build up. At least 14 times, the dialogue is physically sickening. Almost all of these exceptionally terrible lines are sexual in nature.
“Pauline was a dirty, dirty girl. She wasn’t cut out to be a mother, a wife. How had he missed it?” writes Lippman. Later, Lippman indicates Adam’s infatuation with Polly by describing his thoughts about her “wonderful swell of flesh below, like a summer peach. He hope his jones for her passes by the end of peach season.” While sexual intrigue are a part and parcel of the detective fiction genre, the absurd nature of these lines disturb the reader’s immersion as he or she is forced to wonder whether he or she is reading a mystery or a comedy.
Lippman also seems to enjoy making vague overgeneralizations that at first seem profound, but upon closer inspection are hollow and almost laughable. “Maybe everybody lies, all the time,” Lippman writes. “Maybe in the end, all money is bad money,” Lippman pens. While these lines may have been intended to succinctly describe the novel’s themes, bolstering their effect, they instead serve to make the reader question whether Lippman really has anything of substance to say at all. As the novel builds, however, Lippman recovers the story as her vision becomes more clear.
These ridiculous lines of dialogue contrast sharply with the serious themes of abuse, disability, and greed that Lippman builds on going into the novel’s second half. “Sunburn” improves not only thematically by the halfway point, but also qualitatively. Lippman describes Polly’s years of pain and loss as “scar tissue, the purplish, rubbery damage done by burns, thick and marbled.”
As the novel builds, Lippman skillfully fleshes out her characters, making the reader question whether or not they trust or sympathize with the protagonists, mirroring the dilemma the characters find themselves in. In true genre fashion, Lippman’s subjects are nuanced and complex, each with noble and ignoble motivations driving them. Lippman tests the reader’s assumptions as she slowly reveals what lies in the heart and soul of her creations. In addition to fleshing out her characters, Lippman dedicates time and care to building her environment. The small Delaware town of Belleville serves as more than just a backdrop to the drama, but is itself an active participant in the novel.
All things considered, “Sunburn” is a book worth reading. A master of the genre, Lippman builds a world of imperfect but likeable characters whose conflicting interests lead to inevitable doom. While watching this tragedy unfold is highly enjoyable, Lippman’s chapters of sexual intrigue and vague aphorisms are laughably bad at best, and offensive at worst. The value of trudging through these terrible lines is contingent upon whether or not one derives pleasure or pain from a trainwreck.

Kimmery Martin’s “The Queen of Hearts” tells the story of Zadie Anson and Emma Colley, best friends who are living the dream. They’re both rich, successful doctors, happily married with beautiful children, living in the suburban paradise of Charlotte, North Carolina. With such a picture-perfect premise, something catastrophic is bound to happen, and indeed it does, as dirty secrets that have been broiling underneath the shiny surface of their friendship for 20 years come to life. The rupture comes in the form of the charismatic Nick Xenokostas, known as Dr. X to his worshipping students, who was romantically involved with Zadie in medical school. He comes back into the two friends’ lives during a crisis, reopening wounds and asking unanswered questions from a tragedy in their past.
Handled by a less tasteful writer, “The Queen of Hearts” might have been nothing more than melodramatic fluff, like a novelization of “Grey’s Anatomy.” It certainly feels like a TV drama, as it follows character types with easy-to-understand backstories and their own particular quirks and tics, who navigate the quickly-changing tides of professional and personal alliances. The main drive of the story simply comes from the (incredibly frustrating) delay of the big reveal (which is not very surprising). But Martin’s extraordinary sensitivity and empathy shines through during moments of crisis, which draw out the subtle, complex shades of her characters. The novel is emotionally exhausting—partly because of its accurate depiction of the relentless 100-mile-an-hour pace of the lives of working mothers—but ultimately because it tests the furthest limits of forgiveness and understanding.
When she isn’t writing, Martin is an emergency room doctor from Charlotte, North Carolina, and she writes in the afterword that she took the advice, “write what you know,” to heart. She is confident and comfortable in depicting the hospital—an excellent setting for a drama—as doctors are constantly working on the border between life and death. Crises come about organically in such an environment, and the characters come to terms with these obstacles with gripping psychological realism. Alongside incredibly detailed descriptions of work in the operating room, the novel is also chock-full of tender, funny moments from Zadie and Emma’s family lives. It’s a book of extremes, and reading it feels like being taken through a whirlwind of emotions ranging from elation to despair.
The characters of Zadie and Emma are also at extremes, which makes for an entertaining read. Zadie is short and sweet, bubbling with easy charm and maternal warmth, as Zadie is “all shining earnestness and sincerity, with her lilting, lovely eyes and the childish sweep of her snub nose and her little chin,” while Emma is tall and model-like, with blond hair and “swimming-pool-clear-blue-eyes,” standing “alone in the crowd, an ice queen, always reacting a beat too late.” Emma is a fastidious type A, Zadie is a lovably clumsy type B. Their personalities alternatively clash and harmonize, and although the romantic relationships play a huge part in the novel, the true love story is between these two friends. Martin has a true gift for characterization, which is also showcased in the quick sketches of the peripheral characters of the husbands, friends, and children who make up the surrounding chatter.
The novel is structured in alternating chapters from either Zadie or Emma’s point of view, and switching between the past and present-day. It works well for the most part, although it takes some getting used to. Zadie and Emma’s difference in character also becomes clearer as the novel progresses—at first it was difficult to tell who was who—and sometimes it was difficult to keep track of whether something happened 20 years in the past or in the present, especially when switching between jargon-filled operating scenes.
The only part that feels forced is the soft ending, which Martin seemingly chooses because she cannot bear to leave her characters so crushed by the drama. It attempts to end on a lovely note of reconciliation, and it is a testament to the strength of Zadie and Emma’s friendship, but it feels oddly imbalanced with the sheer weight of what transgressed. The novel could have benefited from a more developed denouement.
Although it does have its flaws, the beautifully rendered characters and compelling, rhythmic storyline make “The Queen of Hearts” a thrilling read, and a fascinating look into the medical world. It’s an impressive debut, full of warmth and excitement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Oracular Spectacular”’s tenth birthday reminds us uneasily that the year 2008 was a decade ago, when MGMT finally released the physical version of their debut album in stores. In the intervening 10 years, the record has grown into one of those albums that many of us know, but don’t know we know. While it’s frontloaded with a few of the most recognizable indie electronic pop singles of the late 2000s—like “Time to Pretend” and “Electric Feel”—the second half of the album has escaped our cultural memory.
The record’s second half doesn’t deserve this neglect. It adds a certain level of sonic diversity that has benefitted it as whole. As a result, Rolling Stone named the album the 18th best album of the 2000s, and ranked the record number 494 on its “500 Greatest Albums of All Time” list. And while the second half of “Oracular Spectacular” may not have made a lasting mainstream impression, its successful experimental dive into the hypnotic, the psychedelic, and the otherworldly warrants a second take.
“Oracular Spectacular” can be split into two distinct halves, with “4th Dimensional Transition”’s tribal rhythm marking a tonal shift within the album. It’s a beautiful track composed of trippy psychedelic guitars and synths paired with reverberating vocals. It’s also an effective bridge combining the first half’s buoyant eccentricity and the second half’s experimental rock.  The distinct shift from electronic and pop rock to more indie and guitar-driven psychedelic rock might explain why the second half is less radio-friendly than the first. But the difference doesn’t detract from the cohesion of the album, as both halves embody the thematic mysticism of the title. They just do so in different ways.
The first half feels exactly like an “oracular spectacular,” with its enigmatic opening call and hypnotic melodies. MGMT builds up its iconic sense of nostalgia for something that hasn’t happened yet, presenting psychedelic pop as a sound from the future with a call from the past. The second half preserves that atmosphere—maintaining the band’s personal style—while unraveling whatever order the first half may have created.
Knowing that the stylistic foundation they’ve conceived remains, MGMT begins to change everything but the bare bones, with each song radically different from the last. They ditch catchy melodies and in-your-face electronic beats, replacing them with experimental audio effects and non-recurring forward-looking qualities. Throughout the last five songs, MGMT never gets caught up on a single musical idea. Instead, they move on from experiment to experiment, playing around with sound. Mystifying, varied, and intricate, the second half is best exemplified by “Of Moons, Birds, & Monsters,” which is by far the best track of the last five songs. There is never a dull moment in the song, with shots of busy guitar and bass lines, varying tempos, building vocals, and banging guitar riffs that develop into laid back reflection. It’s small eccentricities like these that permeate the second half of the album, keeping the songs thematic and experimental.
10 years after its physical release, listening to “Oracular Spectacular” feels like a journey to the unexplored. The passing years have highlighted how successful the first five tracks have been, as well as how criminally underrated the last five tracks are. We all know that “Time to Pretend” is entrancing and that “Electric Feel” is sexy, but not everyone knows that “Of Moons, Birds, & Monsters” is an indie rock gem, or appreciates the chanting in “Future Reflections” as a transcendent closer. On its 10 year anniversary, maybe it’s finally time for us to give “Oracular Spectacular”’s second half a second chance.

The Eleven O'Clock
Dir. Derin Seale
Doctor Harry Phillips wants to be called “Doctor,” not “Sir.” Phillips, a psychiatrist, seems uneasy, unsettled. He keeps tugging at his desk drawer, but it won’t open. He has a secretary temp, but just for the day, who tells him his eleven o’clock appointment is with a man who “suffers grandiose delusions, both occupational and reverential”—what’s more, he believes that he is a psychiatrist. Enter Dr. Nathan Kline, the patient, as he takes over his own appointment as the doctor. Cue a frustrating back and forth interaction as the two “doctors” compete to diagnose each other.
“The Eleven O’Clock” is as comical as it is painful to watch. The frustration between the two is almost too palpable, thanks to the skillful acting of Josh Lawson and Damon Herriman, who play Kline and Phillips, respectively. They both play sharp and convincing psychiatrists, maximizing a plot that risks being repetitive and exhausting. The film’s success is also largely due to Josh Lawson’s smart script and its play on words, which peaks during an attempted word association test.

DeKalb Elementary
Dir. Reed Van Dyk
“DeKalb Elementary” is a fictional retelling of what could have been Atlanta’s mirror image of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In both situations, a 20-year-old, mentally ill white man opens fire with an assault rifle into an elementary school. The crucial difference—and what stopped the August 2013 Atlanta shooting from turning deadly—is one brave woman’s compassion for the man who could have killed her. Tarra Riggs is superb as Cassandra Rice, the school’s receptionist, who mediates between the shooter and a 911 responder—composed, while she waits alone in a room with a man who will either turn himself in or go on a killing spree. The film rings eerily true, especially in the wake of the recent, heartbreaking shooting in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people.
The short film’s brilliance lies in its realism. With the screenplay dialogue taken directly from the transcript of the actual 911 call made, the film balances the terrifying anxiety of the situation at hand and the calm required of both Rice and the audience to see it through to the end—all in a mere 21 minutes. Van Dyk makes sure to immortalize one woman’s story—one that undoubtedly would have gradually disappeared into history—in an uncanny short that speaks to the times we live in. A hero, Rice saves the day with her compassion. “It’s a good thing you’re giving up. We all go through something in life, OK?” she comforts the gunman, as he prepares to turn himself in. We can only hope to be as brave as Rice if and when that “something” comes.



My Nephew Emmett
Dir. Kevin Wilson Jr.
In “My Nephew Emmett,” director Kevin Wilson Jr. takes a look at the less publicized, but crucial point of view of Moses “Mose” Wright (L.B. Williams), uncle of Emmett Till (Joshua Wright), the teenager from Chicago whose 1955 lynching helped push the Civil Rights Movement into motion. The short film relies heavily on closeups of Wright, whose stunning, subtle performance carries the film, and on the countryside’s natural soundtrack, with crickets and other noises of the night painting a deceptively peaceful picture while Wright waits helplessly for the horrors that still plague this country to take place.
The tension builds with Wright’s dread, as the clock slowly ticks to the moment his nephew is taken away to be beaten, mutilated, terrorized, and ultimately shot for allegedly whistling at a white woman. As Wright bathes, waiting for the inevitable, he immerses himself in water in a scene reminiscent of another gorgeous movie, similarly built on closeups and starring a black man: “Moonlight.” But where Chiron’s submersion is liberating, Wright’s is harrowingly suffocating: sounds of an underwater struggle play over his submersion, perhaps in an attempt to reflect Wright’s agony as to what he know will inevitably happen, or even more disturbingly, to call to Emmett Till’s own drowning, as the 14-year-old boy’s body was ultimately thrown into the Tallahatchie River.
Both Wright’s and the audience’s foreboding painfully manifests itself in the downturn of Wright’s lips, in the bulge of his eyes as sleep eludes him, in the veins that strain across his face as he waits for the moment we all know is coming. Despite the film’s weak ending—Wilson Jr. inserts actual footage of Wright’s interview the day he identified his nephew’s body, possibly to cement the story as a real man’s experience, but inadvertently takes away from Williams’ beautiful performance—the film stands as tall as Wright, thanks to Williams.




The Silent Child
Dir. Chris Overton
Disabilities deserve to be recognized, but they are not inherent hindrances. First-time screenwriter Rachel Shenton makes this message clear in the film, “The Silent Child.” Shenton plays social worker Joanne, who is brought in to help Libby, a four-year-old girl who is completely deaf. As Libby’s mother insists the girl learn speech therapy over sign language to integrate her into school, Joanne soon realises Libby is a child silenced not by her disability, but by her family. Her siblings are too busy with their own lives to interact with Libby, and her parents speak to her as if she can hear.
What then unfolds between Joanne and Libby is more than a mentor-mentee relationship. “Jo” becomes her only sympathetic and patient friend. Six-year-old Maisie Sly, who plays Libby and is deaf in real life, speaks beyond sign language. Her facial expressions, from blank stares to shy laughter, capture her journey as she learns to sign. The cinematography is striking in its bleakness. Jo travels by bike, lending room to panoramic shots of the foggy, rural landscape, which briefly glimmers under the sun when Libby is briefly allowed to communicate for herself.
The film ends with sobering facts about the experience of deaf children: “Over 78 percent of deaf children attend mainstream school with no specialist support in place.” Shenton hopes that “this film contributes in the fight for sign language to be recognized in every school across the globe.” Even so, “The Silent Child” isn’t preachy or aggressive—Shenton has successfully created a powerful yet subtle message with her simple storyline.

Watu Wote: All of Us
Dir. Katja Benrath
“The region between Kenya and Somalia is considered highly dangerous. In recent years Christians have repeatedly been attacked by Al-Shabaab terrorists,” on-screen text explains. Jua (Adelyne Wairimu), the film’s protagonist, is one such Christian. Having lost her baby and her husband to the aforementioned terrorism, she alienates all Muslims, including those who do not share the same extremist views as the Al-Shabaab terrorists. In line with the unofficial theme for many of this year’s nominated live-action short films, “Watu Wote” is also based on a true story: On a bus ride back to visit her sick mother—and the place where her husband and child were killed—Jua finds herself in the midst of a terrorist attack. The terrorists stop the bus and demand for all Christians to be separated from the Muslims. The threat is clear: They intend to kill the Christians, and the Muslims who would protect them, which turns out to be all of them. Jua is saved when her neighbor, a Muslim mother, quickly throws a hijab onto her head to hide her identity. Even Salah Farah (Abdiwali Farrah), a Muslim teacher toward whom Jua was initially volatile, questions the terrorists and their actions, protecting the Christian passengers from an undeserved fate.
The film depicts different people coming together to protect themselves, even at the risk of their own life. But, though poignant and timely, the film fails to convey what should have been a powerful message about unity and the rejection of bigotry, as Jua wanders away as she reaches her final destination to greet what we can assume is her family without coming to terms with what happened or the sacrifices people made to protect her.

Dear Basketball
Dir. Glen Keane
On November of 2015, Kobe Bryant released a letter to the Players’ Tribune announcing his retirement from basketball. “Dear Basketball” is animated version of this love letter and goodbye, narrated by Bryant himself. After an illustrious career, he focuses on his childhood love for basketball and how his dream has manifested into reality. The sentiment is there, but paired with hand-drawn animations by Disney artist Glen Keane and a stirring score by John Williams (both of which would be beautiful alone), the film appears cheesy and almost self-absorbed. Keane’s drawings swiftly capture Bryant’s movement and facial expressions, but Bryant’s different jerseys are the only color among black and white sketches, emphasizing renowned team names rather than his story. The instrumentals, which crescendo when Bryant takes a shot (or makes a sentimental remark), over-dramatize already poignant moments—Bryant’s voice is powerful enough to stand on its own. There are only seconds of simplicity, like when young Kobe Bryant and old Kobe Bryant play on the court at the same time, unfettered by cinematic flair—something the rest of the film should have emulated.

Garden Party
Dir. Florian Babikian, Vincent Bayoux, Victor Caire, Théophile Dufresne, Gabriel Grapperon, Lucas Navarro
Frogs navigate a humanless world in “Garden Party.” As they follow their primal instincts, four amphibians slowly reveal details about the tropical villa scene: a debris-filled pool, a kitchen littered with rotten food, a cracked security camera, bullet holes in the doors and windows, and a ransacked safe. Aside from the ribbets and buzzing insects, the film is eerily silent. That is, until one frog finds the house’s control pad and jumps from button to button, illuminating rooms, setting off pool fountains, and cueing upbeat jazz music, all of which set the stage for a final reveal.
A self-proclaimed “dark comedy,” “Garden Party” is a flawlessly executed three dimensional animation. The team behind the film took extra care to seamlessly integrate the frogs into the scene—the patter of their footsteps and marks of their footprints, the glossy reflections in their eyes, the texture of their skin, and the weight of their bodies as they move across different fabrics—and each scene is as crisp and beautiful as the next. Dramatic camera angles from above remind viewers of the frogs’ small size as they discover the unoccupied villa, from ostentatious bedrooms to gargantuan lion fountains. Even with an amphibian romance, gone is the overly saccharine animal animation. This party has a dark subplot, one that is artfully revealed in just seven minutes. 



Lou
Dir. Dave Mullins
Fresh off their win for Best Animated Short Film at 89th Oscars ceremony, Pixar is back to defend its title with “Lou.” A story that campaigns against bullying and for friendships, “Lou” follows a boy who, after bullying his fellow classmates, must return their lost toys to them in exchange for his own treasure, a long-lost teddy bear he can obtain only from the toy-automaton that is trying to teach him a lesson. As is the norm with Pixar, the film’s animation is pristine, and its message is sweet. Unfortunately, the short film fails to transcend any basic level of emotion. Though the boy ultimately learns from his mistake—he bullied others to cope with his own bullying—“Lou” lacks a certain subtlety in its storytelling that keeps Pixar from rising to the heights it is well known for.



Negative Space
Dir. Max Porter and Ru Kuwuhata
This year’s only stop-motion nominee, “Negative Space” is an exploration of the age-old father-son relationship that defies tropes with its unique storytelling. Adapted from a poem by Ron Koertge, the main character narrates his childhood growing up and bonding with his traveling father by packing his suitcases for him. The packing is always “perfect,” as his father praises him, approval the boy yearns for.
As it turns out, it is less that the boy packs the clothes as it is the clothes that pack themselves,  and even the boy himself at one point. As the clothes come to life—a belt imitates a snake, socks become and seaweed, t-shirts swim across the screen—the short animated film becomes Koertge’s poetry, which it is based on. Indeed, “Negative Space” is a son’s ode to his father, and though the narrator’s monotonous voice betrays no emotion, Porter and Kuwuhata insert it into the movie slowly and carefully, ensnaring an unknowing audience into its quiet but lyrical world.

 
Revolting Rhymes
Dir. Jakob Schuh and Jan Lachauer
A wolf in a trench coat joins a woman in a café who is waiting to babysit. He flips through the pages of her children’s fairytale book, scoffing—“Happily ever after?”—before embarking on his own tale describing the deaths of his two nephews. Based on the book by Roald Dahl, the animated short “Revolting Rhymes” presents a fairytale within a fairytale. The wolf’s story, which intertwines the lives of the Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, and the Three Little Pigs, doesn’t diverge much from the original, but it does add some grit—and in Little Red’s case, a gun. The two girls meet when Snow White’s mother passes away, and the intricacies of their respective stories start to complicate their friendship as they navigate unstable families, greedy pigs, and voracious wolves. Overall, “Revolting Rhymes” skillfully integrates a twisted subplot within an animation children will love.
As the name “Revolting Rhymes” implies, the wolf narrates in rhymes, but they often carry a morbid gravitas: “The small girl smiles, one eye flickers. She whips a pistol from her knickers. She aims it at the poor boy’s head, and BANG, BANG, BANG—she shoots him dead.” What’s more, the characters sometimes deviate from their expected script. When Little Red finds a wolf in her grandmother’s place, she strokes his snout as she says, “What a lovely great big furry coat you have on,” to which he yells, “That’s wrong! That’s wrong! Have you forgot to tell me what big teeth I’ve got?”
This story of revenge, veiled by idiosyncratic characters and fluorescent animation, is seamlessly multifaceted and full of surprises. Little Red and Snow White become independent women that the classic tales never gave room for. It also ends with a final twist, one that asserts the wolf and woman’s story as its own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her latest book of essays, Marilynne Robinson is of two minds about the present moment. “We have surrendered thought to ideology,” she laments in the preface. A mere 20 pages later, in the titular essay, Robinson reflects: “I know that one is expected to bemoan the present time, to say something about decline and the loss of values… But I find a great deal to respect.”
Robinson’s seeming self-contradiction comes across as thoughtful consideration of alternatives, as opposed to hypocrisy or Orwellian doublethink. It is her capacity and willingness to consider multiple, often contradicting, views of the world, which ultimately lends nuance and credibility to her philosophy.
“What Are We Doing Here?” is the Pulitzer-winning writer’s latest nonfictional publication, a carefully considered—if occasionally erudite—tome of essays, largely curated from lectures delivered at universities in the year leading up to President Trump’s election in 2016. Given the timestamps, the book’s content feels especially prescient, over a year after his inauguration. Robinson’s philosophy combats the natural instinct to hold fast to ideology. instead it encourages open-mindedness, even for the nonreligious. Wielding precision of language and an immense, intimate knowledge of theology, Robinson deals deftly with weighty polemical abstractions, those she considers sacred: science, religion, humanity, education, and above all, truth.
“I know it is conventional to say we Americans are radically divided, polarized,” Robinson’s preface begins. “But… In essential ways we share false assumptions and flawed conclusions that are never effectively examined.” These flawed conclusions, Robinson posits, are the backbone of centuries-old debates that end, with resentment and bickering, in an unproductive stalemate. The essays in “What Are We Doing Here?” strive to revivify these debates, namely that between religion and science, which date back to the Enlightenment and beyond. Robinson asserts that religion and science do not merely coexist, but inform each other. “Science departed from its origins in religion not so very long ago,” Robinson writes in “The Divine,” a lecture that she gave at Harvard Memorial Church in 2016. “If these two great thought systems are not now once again reaching a place of convergence, the fault lies with religion, which, in a fit of defensive panic, has abandoned its profoundest insights and has never reclaimed them.”
Though Robinson is well-equipped to unpack lofty academic ideas, her prose—often novelistic in its sensibilities—works best when it deals with the concrete, particularly the personal. This is the same writer, of course, whose more famous works include the likes of “Housekeeping” and “Gilead,” the latter for which she won a Pulitzer in 2005—fictional works of intense pathos and interior consciousness. Throughout the text, she maintains a relatively impermeable boundary between the critical and the personal, reluctant to delve too deeply into personal essay territory (this is, after all, a book of critical essays). But in “Slander,” the final essay and one written specifically for the book, Robinson turns away from the scholarly and toward the personal. Her language sharpens, condenses: “I saw a clip of some Fox blondie saying that our conversation proved that Obama hated Christianity,” she writes, hardly bothering to hide her bitterness. And later, criticizing what she terms “the age of the weird intrusion,” our newfound ability to rationalize our own beliefs to the point of displacing the real world: “I remember when I was a child, walking out of a movie theater and finding the world outside utterly bland and dull. Now we can all impose Technicolor fantasies on that world, if we are so inclined. Infotainment they call it.”
There’s a particular danger of living in the world of Technicolor fantasies in the age of weird intrusion, in the era of fake news and post-truth. Critical thought becomes harder. Blind consensus becomes the norm. “Consensus really ought not trump reason or preclude it, though it does, routinely,” Robinson writes. “We have allowed ourselves to become bitterly factionalized, and truth has lost its power to resolve or to persuade.”
Trying to prove humanity’s inherent virtue is remarkably difficult, yet Robinson tries. It was difficult when Robinson first delivered these speeches, in the year leading up to Trump’s election. It is difficult now, in the midst of a governmental attempt to jeopardize the status of immigrants and increase premiums for health care. It is difficult now, mere days after a deadly mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.
And Robinson understands this. She tempers optimism with reality, writing, “Nothing is simple. Absolutely nothing.” Yes, America still has work to do before it could realistically have justice and order: “The country needs to regain equilibrium and direction. It needs to recover the memory of the best it has done, and then try to do it all better.” Human nature is not uniformly good—it’s profoundly complicated. Humans have perverted language by inventing the slur (as she points out in “The Divine”). People are the propagators of wars, famines, and persecutions (in “A Proof, a Test, an Instruction”). Our power is defined by “an overhanging capability to do harm.”
Despite all of this, Robinson focuses on the human capability to do good. “Let us face the truth, that human beings are astonishing creatures, each life so singular in its composition and so deeply akin to others that they are inexhaustibly the subject of every art,” she concludes in “The Sacred, the Human.” Amidst her biting social and political critique, she steadfastly maintains a fundamental belief in the goodness of people. It’s the boldest claim of the entire book.

The decision to name Lawrence S. Bacow Harvard’s 29th president will crystallize much of the same disagreement that defines the modern Democratic Party. His supporters will point to his track record as an environmental studies professor, a skilled fundraiser, and founder of Tufts University’s Office of Institutional Diversity. Critics will note his ties to large corporations and impute a pragmatism unsuited for radical reform. Time will tell how these debates unfold.
In the immediate, however, the community and public have become embroiled in another development: that Bacow’s selection marks "a return to white male leadership.”
One need not venture further than Twitter to witness the array of frustrated responses, including one user’s pithy congratulation to Harvard “on yet again choosing…a straight white male economist named Larry” (a reference to previous Harvard president Lawrence H. Summers). Other more banal assessments have included lamentations that Harvard would “crown yet another white man” and cynicisms about this “radical break with tradition.” These, along with at least one post in the popular Facebook group “Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens,” are telling of where our collective priorities lie.
In its coverage this past week, The Crimson has already detailed the range of relevant attitudes among campus ethnic organizations, which at various moments have called for Latino representation among the presidential candidates, requests for a strong affirmative action advocate, and demands for a champion of ethnic studies. In contrast, someone has yet to probe the connection between these resurgent identity discussions and our liberal sensibilities: specifically, how we resolve the old dilemma of “process” versus “outcome” in the context of representation.
Addressing this disjunction requires acknowledging competing conceptions of the problem. Process liberals view underrepresentation as the result of two potential failures: either that the selection committee inaccurately reflected the diversity of the public, or that the options under consideration were too narrow. Reform, as the process liberal sees it, must occur at one of these sites, on the theory that you can diversify the applicant pool but cannot assign an identity requirement to the position under offer.
Outcome liberals view underrepresentation as a problem requiring direct intervention. That traditional liberal norms cannot always accommodate diversity at the final stage is, according to these liberals, a shortcoming in itself. While amending procedures and attitudes might shore up long-run gains, they suggest, these reforms are impotent in the immediate.
Since America’s inception, leaders and administrators have litigated this dispute in the public sphere, at times improving processes and at others intervening in outcomes. Reconstruction, for instance, reflected a preoccupation with immediate, supervised results. By contrast, the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, emphasized process reform, putting in place the armature for labor laws and social insurance. Both were avenues for sweeping overhaul, occasionally operating in tandem.  Process reforms, like Roosevelt’s, often endure longer.
With Bacow’s selection, outcome-oriented liberals seem to have dominated the response. As a result, few have bothered to ask the important process question: Were the applicant pool and selection body accurate reflections of the polity? Admittedly, this question leaves ample room for ambiguity, but nothing on an unprecedented scale.  Three hundred years after Rousseau explained that democracies ought to identify a “general will” upon which to base decisions, we still struggle to locate it in practice; his point was no less crucial for it.
Calling attention to the rift between outcome and process-oriented perspectives is a timely project, particularly in the wake of similar liberal indecision following the 2016 election. Then, there was much excitement about a woman snagging the nomination of a major political party, which many cast as a sign of social progress. When Donald Trump won, Democrats had to parse through the wreckage in search of lessons. One crucial (yet unvoiced) question from that soul-searching was what to make of Clinton’s womanhood. Did her presence—which marked a widening of the horizon of representation—still reflect some sort of progress? Process liberals would say so; outcome liberals might disagree.
This taking stock of difference is a strong first step toward regrouping. In particular, it will help disabuse us of our yearnings for another 2008, when process and outcome aligned in a moment of moral triumph with the election of Barack Obama to the presidency. Those sorts of victories have proven rare and—more insidiously—deceptive to our democratic sense. They allow us to ignore the river running through our ideological camp.  Liberals must set about bridging the rift between outcome and process, recognizing the advantage of the latter approach in times of urgency and the former when preparing for the long haul.
Rounding out the discussion about Bacow’s selection requires that we note that the presidential choice doesn’t reflect, as some would have it, a compromise. Bacow is not, as I’ve heard one classmate claim, a “carbon copy” of our past. He is the child of Jewish immigrants who came to this country fleeing brutal systemic violence (his mother was an Auschwitz survivor). Surely, these experiences have had some bearing on his moral faculties.
All the same, I say we stay positive. That Bacow is our incoming president may well prove to be a win-win scenario. Either he takes up the mantle of progress that some had hoped a woman of color would, or he forces us to finally acknowledge—and adjudicate—our liberal indecisions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith recently said he would not commit to new long-term projects in light of a recently enacted tax on wealthy university endowments which would have required Harvard to pay an estimated $43 million to the federal government in fiscal year 2017. We reaffirm our view that this tax is an attack on higher education that is unprecedented in American history. Now, Smith’s announcement provides the first indication that the bill may have devastating ramifications for University programming.
In recent memory, tax exemptions for higher education have been uncontroversial and popular. It is only quite recently that bills such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 have required leaders of higher education to justify why their universities’ high endowments should go untaxed. It was previously understood that the programs that Harvard’s endowment funds are vital not only to the University but also to the country and the world.
A $43 million budget could prevent Harvard from providing necessary initiatives to help its students. Financial aid, for example, is largely funded by Harvard’s endowment and therefore could be impacted by the tax increase. The redistribution of wealth facilitated by the tax bill takes financial resources meant for hardworking students and gives them to billionaires, something that is fundamentally unfair. As a result, the University should do everything in its power to preserve financial aid as well as diversity and inclusion programs to counter this affront to students on financial aid.
Aside from the injustices students will face as a result of the tax, the policy also does a disservice to the broader national and global community. Spending reductions caused by the endowment tax could likely prevent the University from funding groundbreaking and necessary research, stifling vital medical breakthroughs and technological developments.
Furthermore, this attack on higher education is unprecedentedly partisan. Republican attacks against institutions like Harvard score easy political points with its conservative base. Taxing the Harvard endowment to fund tax cuts may be politically savvy, but it is certainly socially undesirable. The policy fundamentally prioritizes wealthy individual taxpayers above the larger public good.
The endowment tax is a calculated disregard for the important role of research in American society at a time when even facts are under constant attack by our leaders. As the University and its students continues to use its clout and influence to advocate for the reversal of this tax, we urge Congress to reconsider its merits. The work that our universities do is too important to be taxed to oblivion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 20, 2018 at 7:56 p.m.
Last Friday, Harvard College Faith and Action brought hip-hop artist and self-proclaimed ex-gay Christian activist Jackie Hill-Perry to campus for a half-hour-long sermon, in which she talked about the evils of homosexuality. During the event, Hill-Perry argued that queer people must make a choice between living a selfish life of sin or suppressing our desires and following the word of God. The event was billed by HCFA as “a respectful dialogue about sexual ethics for Christians in the spirit of love and kindness.” In reality, the event was the furthest thing possible from “respectful.”
By hosting the event—in spite of numerous calls and petitions for it to be cancelled—HCFA was complicit in promoting dangerous homophobic rhetoric that threatened the emotional and physical safety of LGBT people here on campus. No matter how many seats were reserved for protestors, no matter how much the student leaders attempted to qualify their message as loving and inclusive, HCFA still gave this woman a platform to preach a dangerous homophobic sermon for over half an hour.
Last Friday, I listened to a woman with no formal divinity education declare that a person’s sexual orientation is merely a clustering of immoral “attractions,” urges, and desires that are shameful and must be suppressed. For half an hour, I watched a woman preach in the same room as my Government 1510: “American Constitutional Law” lecture that living a life of homosexuality is an obnoxious act of defiance towards God—one that will make me dead and put me in hell. But even more horrifying than this woman’s rhetoric was seeing a room full of my fellow classmates nod their heads and snap their fingers in agreement to numerous parts of her sermon. I watched as kids I know from section, midterm review groups, or the dining hall scream “Amen!” as Hill-Perry described gay people as “broken.”
Queer people at Harvard have always known that this school is not perfect when it comes to fully welcoming LGBT students on campus. In 1920, Dean of the College Chester N. Greenough ’98 formed a “secret court” to investigate, try, and expel College students accused of being homosexual. To this day, we have a freshman dormitory named in his honor.
I’ve sat in section while a straight man explained to me that if I spoke with a lower-pitched voice it would help with my upcoming in-class presentation grade as more people would take me seriously. I’ve walked along Mt. Auburn Street on countless late nights and watched as boys in tuxedos laughingly call each other faggots. And last Friday, after leaving the event, I comforted a freshman crying on the steps of Emerson Hall who was distraught at having to choose between their religion and coming out publicly.
This is not the Harvard I signed up for. To HCFA: What was the point of bringing a speaker that emotionally traumatized your fellow classmates? Do you consider students crying in the Yard a successful outcome of your “respectful dialogue”?
To those in that room snapping your fingers in agreement with Hill-Perry’s sermon: Will you look me in the eyes and tell me that I am perverted and “broken”? That my identity—one that is so crucial to who I am—is merely just a grouping of immoral desires that I need to “deny” for the rest of my life?
To non-LGBT Harvard students: What are you doing to call out dangerous trans- and homophobic rhetoric when you see or hear it on campus? We are your friends, your classmates, and your peers. This is so much more than pushing back on a problematic comment in section—we need you to show up.
One recent morning, I woke up to an email from the Admissions Office asking me to call accepted LGBT students in the Class of 2022 and encourage them to enroll. I want to be able to do that to make that sell, to say this school is a safe and welcoming space for queer people. But there is so much more work to be done before I would pick up that phone.

CORRECTION: January 23, 2018
A previous version of this op-ed incorrectly stated that Hill-Perry spoke for over an hour. In fact, she spoke for just over half an hour.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nicholas: Last semester, the two of us—with some wonderful friends and partners—organized a counter-rally against Charles A. Murray ’65, the (blatant) white nationalist that the Open Campus Initiative saw fit to bring to campus. A major criticism against our protest was that we were trampling over the free speech rights of Murray and OCI, a critique made doubly damning in the minds of our opponents due to OCI’s purported purpose to “test free speech” by inviting “controversial speakers” to Harvard. We were failing that test. We were proving OCI and its followers right, that Harvard’s leftist snowflakes just couldn’t take the “intellectual discourse” guaranteed by free speech values.
Salma: As the students who were organizing the counter-rally, we were catapulted into a national debate about freedom of speech on college campuses. The debate has been framed as a binary: You either defend freedom of speech or attack it. You either sit back and watch silently, complacent as Murray is invited to campus or you’re childish, unwilling to listen to differing opinions, labeled as unreasonable. Through our response to Murray’s campus invitation, we attempted to introduce more nuance into the conversation and to challenge that binary which has been eternally rigged against us.
Playing into the theory that speech in America exists in a marketplace of ideas—that false or harmful ideas will be filtered out by the powers of supply and demand—we decided to challenge speech with speech.
N: Who, in theory, does the right to freedom of speech—the right against infringement by a governmental body on the capacity to speak—protect? Who is it meant for?
The right to freedom of speech is a political decision to enshrine the ability of those under threat from the state/majoritarian culture to fight back, to resist. In other words, the right to freedom of speech exists in this country for black Americans, Muslim Americans, Latinx and queer and working class and undocumented and all other Americans who are under threat from their government. People like Murray have never been threatened by this country’s government, a government that is itself still resting on the vestiges of its white supremacist past. Just look at Brandenburg v. Ohio, in which the U.S. Supreme Court completely revised their free speech doctrine in order to refrain from prosecuting a Ku Klux Klan member for anti-black speech. Salma, you and I needed the right to speak that day. Fifty years ago, we would have been the ones imprisoned, or beaten, or lynched, for daring to vocalize our blackness.
The thing is, speech does not exist in a vacuum. The free marketplace is a myth. Ideas do not rise unhindered by the weights of political power and social capital. The right to speak one’s mind does not itself exist independent of structures of power and disempowerment, equality and inequality. Who then, in practice, has the right to freedom of speech? Who is able to apply this right intended to protect those disempowered by the majoritarian state?
Again, fifty years ago, we would’ve been faced with a lynch mob, strung up to die, and the government would’ve done nothing. It is not Murray who needs the right to freedom of speech: It is you and I. But historically, and to this day, it is not you and I who receive this right, but Charles Murray.
S: We know that freedom of speech comes at a cost, and that cost is a hefty one—speech that threatens the humanity and existence of those most vulnerable in our society is tolerated and uplifted, often unchecked. The cost is human lives, dreams squandered, voices disempowered, terror inflicted. And that cost is always paid by those who are most vulnerable.
In Collin v. Smith, the Supreme Court ruled that the regulation of a Nazi march in Skokie, I.L., a town that was majority Jewish, was unconstitutional because the Jewish residents in the town could ignore the march, could simply avert their eyes from the trauma that was directly targeting their community. Marginalized communities have consistently been asked to turn the other way when they see a cross burning, to stay smiling when scientific racism is given a platform. We have consistently been asked to bear that burden.
Freedom of speech doctrine is formulated around whiteness, around those who have never experienced the visceral pain of being told that you are less than because of your race, religion, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. It is formulated around those who have never faced the systematic oppression that comes hand in hand with these interpersonal attacks, and who have never been asked to bear the costs that come with a libertarian free speech doctrine.
N: Radical advocates of color are consistently labeled as enemies of free speech. By daring to speak against the great monolith of white supremacy, in all its nefarious manifestations—such as Murray—they are believed to be dismantling some universal right. We have sought to remind our readers that an activist of color critiquing a state-supported manifestation of our oppression simply cannot be dismantling the freedom of speech. They are, in fact, exercising it. Who truly challenges freedom of speech? Not us, but rather the opponents of activists of color, those critiquing our attempts at liberation. When we stood outside Northwest Labs, we entrusted ourselves to a tradition of black and brown radicalists who dared to employ the right they were supposedly guaranteed, and suffered for it.
Our free speech is as valuable as Murray’s. Attempts to obfuscate this fact only serve to perpetuate our oppression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Laura U. Moon ’88 crossed the Charles River as an undergraduate to sit in on one of her father’s classes at the Business School, she quickly realized she was far from one of her anonymous lectures in Sanders Theatre. She watched with surprise as he paced the classroom, occasionally hopped up on the front desk to swing his legs, and systematically ripped his students’ arguments to shreds.
“He did it in such a playful way,” Moon said. “He used the process of teaching to help his students live and breathe the learning.”
A longtime professor of business administration, Hugo E. R. Uyterhoeven died on Jan. 29 at 86 due to complications from a bike ride injury. He was remembered by family and colleagues for his attention to detail, people-oriented attitude, and quick-wittedness that led to a prolific teaching and administrative career spanning more than 50 years.
Malcolm S. Salter ’62, a Business School professor emeritus who taught the second-year required course “Business Policy” under Uyterhoeven, said Uyterhoeven’s vivacious teaching style pushed his students hard but was never mean-spirited.
Salter recalled a class where Uyterhoeven asked the students to calculate a company’s profit. After they agreed the company was cash-rich, he helped them peel back the layers until the class was divided on whether the company was next to broke, overflowing with money, or somewhere in between.
“Well, wait a minute now,” Salter remembered Uyterhoeven saying. “You’re the best and brightest. We’ve just spent an hour, and we can’t figure out whether this company has enough cash to do what it wants to do? How’d you get into the Harvard Business School anyway?”
Philippe C. Haspeslagh, a former student and professor at a Belgian business school, said Uyterhoeven was “the ultimate case teacher.”
“His questions, sharp mind and wit had us all in awe, yet we all loved being pushed by him, sensing his genuine warm interest in developing us as persons.” Haspeslagh wrote in an email.
Uyterhoeven’s guiding principle was to use simple frameworks to analyze complex questions from many different angles. Salter recalled a time when Uyterhoeven took a single case study problem and stretched it over not just one 80-minute class period, but three.
“He had a lot of common sense,” Salter said. “Uncommon common sense, I would say.”
Academically, Uyterhoeven was interested in middle management, something understudied at the time, Moon said. Other topics of interest included domestic and international economy and business and government interactions.
The center of his academic life was pedagogy, and many of his writings were teaching materials for course development rather than academic articles for publication.
Yet Uyterhoeven’s path to discover his passion for teaching was far from straightforward. Born on August 6, 1931 in Eindhoven, Netherlands, he grew up facing food shortages, bombings, and separation from his father during World War II under Nazi occupation. According to family members, young Uyterhoeven had to navigate crossing the Nazi-protected border to Belgium by himself to visit his father.
When he was 17 years old, Uyterhoeven moved to Switzerland, where he finished high school and earned a law degree. He then received a scholarship to come to the U.S. and enrolled at the Business School, becoming a Baker Scholar with High Distinction in 1957.
After graduating, Uyterhoeven decided to work as a research associate for a visiting Harvard professor at a prominent Swiss business school. Several times during that year, the Business School professor he was working with had scheduling conflicts with his class and asked Uyterhoeven to teach in his stead. That was when Uyterhoeven fell in love with the theatricality of teaching.
In addition to his teaching, Uyterhoeven brought the same energy and conscientiousness to a variety of administrative roles as well. Over the course of his career, he worked in several positions at the Business School and set the model for reunions, developed corporate and public relations, and oversaw extensive campus renovations.
“You and I could walk together around the Business School and I could point out many things and say ‘that is Hugo,’” said Angela Q. Crispi, Business School executive dean for administration.
Crispi described a meeting where Uyterhoeven brought three separate flip charts and ran between each of them with colored pens to capture the ideas of his colleagues. When renovating faculty offices, he built mock-ups of three potential layouts and had professors test them for a year.
“He had this ability to go from a vision to how to implement at a micro level,” Crispi said.
Uyterhoeven even extended his administrative talents beyond the Business School—to Weston, Mass., where he lived for more than 40 years, and to John’s Island in Vero Beach, Fla., where he retired with his wife, Julie Zhu. Moon recalled how as president of the Weston Forest and Trail Association, her father ultimately doubled the acreage of conservation land and trails. He even used a connection with a former student to acquire free trail markers made of scrap aluminum.
Upon retirement, he served as president of his condominium association for seven years, restructuring their finances, improving their hurricane insurance, and enacting physical renovations to the building.
He also co-chaired a business and economic history lecture series at the John’s Island Club called the Gold Seminar.
“Hugo wanted more in retirement than golf and tennis,” George D. Higgs, the other co-chair of the Gold Seminar, wrote in an email. “You knew you were in the presence of greatness.”
Uyterhoeven loved jazz and had a comprehensive CD collection ranging from household names like Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald to more niche singers like Blossom Dearie and Eartha Kitt. Moon said his biggest advice was to never take yourself too seriously–and to never bounce a check.
“For me and for so many of us he has always been our rock,” Moon said. “Somehow I feel a strength and a readiness to know that all of the things I’ve learned from him are a part of me now.”
Uyterhoeven is survived by his wife, Julie Zhu, and five daughters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student activists from the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee joined other Boston-area Palestinian rights advocacy groups Saturday to protest the treatment of 17-year-old Palestinian Ahed Tamimi.
Saturday’s event came as Tamimi’s father has been calling for justice for the Palestinian teenager, who was arrested in December for slapping an Israeli soldier after her 14-year-old cousin was shot in the face.
Tamimi faces 12 charges in Israel’s military court.
Roughly two dozen people, including members of the College Palestine Solidarity Committee, gathered in downtown Boston to protest Tamimi’s arrest.
“Hopefully today will continue to raise awareness,” said Christian B. Tabash ’21, a Palestine Solidarity Committee co-vice president. “Living in the United States, it is extremely difficult to even comprehend what life is like as a Palestinian under Israeli occupation.”
Tabash said he hopes informing the student body—and public at large—will help “instill a sense of urgency for justice,” which in turn would affect global change.
“It’s hard to get people motivated,” said Heide L. Rogers ’21, who helped organize the Harvard group’s participation at the demonstration. “I was telling other freshmen about it yesterday, what we’re doing today, and nobody knew anything. And it’s definitely something I think people should know about.”
Chanting slogans like “Israel, Israel, we say no—occupation has to go,” and “Free, free, Ahed Tamimi,” demonstrators distributed leaflets and spoke to passerby as part of their quest to raise awareness for Ahed Tamimi’s case.
Some protesters wore keffiyehs, traditional checkered square scarves that have become associated with Palestinian nationalism in the past century.
Tabash said even small gestures, like the solidarity committee’s efforts to publicize events on campus, “continue to raise a little awareness, even if people don’t show up.”
Members of other Boston-based Palestinian solidarity groups, such as the Northeastern University Students for Justice in Palestine and Boston University Students for Justice in Palestine, also participated in Saturday’s protest. Other local advocacy groups, such as Jewish Voice for Peace Boston, were also in attendance.
“Through our work in the PSC and through these demonstrations and events that we’ll host in the spring, we hope that we’ll be some type of catalyst for change,” Tabash said.

UPDATED: February 19, 11:16 p.m.
Students, faculty, and administrators at the Law School say they are pleased  Harvard’s 29th president will be one of their own.
University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow, who will take office after President Drew G. Faust steps down in June, graduated from the Law School with a J.D. in 1976. He also holds two degrees from the Kennedy School.
Law School affiliates are eager to embrace a president with long-standing ties to the school. Bacow, an environmental policy expert, spent a number of his formative years at the school and met his wife, Adele F. Bacow, on the Law School campus during the first day of orientation.
Bacow, who served as the chancellor of MIT and the president of Tufts University, returned to his former stomping grounds decades after graduating, taking a seat on the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, in 2011. He also worked on the Program on Negotiation at the Law School.
John F. Manning ’82, dean of the Law School, wrote in an emailed statement that he is “delighted” with Bacow’s appointment and “look[s] forward to working with him.”
“I am delighted that our alumnus Lawrence S. Bacow will lead Harvard University. When I became dean, one of the most frequent pieces of advice I got from fellow deans was, ‘You need to meet Larry Bacow; he has terrific insights about how to lead a school.’  They were right,” Manning wrote.
Manning’s predecessor as dean, Martha L. Minow, wrote in an email that she thinks Bacow’s legal training has equipped him well to lead universities like Tufts, and now, Harvard.
“Larry Bacow is not only a proven, effective leader in higher education who passionately cares about access, inclusion, and excellence; he is also genuinely perceptive and wise,” she wrote. “Because he continually integrates rigorous analysis with generous human concerns (helped by his legal and economics training!), his leadership bodes so well not only for Harvard but for all affected by higher education.”
Not many current HLS scholars taught Bacow in the ’70s, but Laurence H. Tribe ’62, a Law School professor, said he wishes he had known Bacow as a student.
“Larry Bacow wasn’t my student, but I wish he had been,” Tribe wrote in an email. “He’s a wonderful choice as Harvard’s next President and I look forward to getting to know him. Just listening to one of his long-form interviews is a source of inspiration and comfort. His background and vision seem ideal for this difficult time of turmoil and transition.”
Jyoti Jasrasaria ’12, a third-year law student who chaired the student committee that advised the presidential search, said the committee reached out to students across the University, including law students, to solicit input about the search.
“Personally, I think, based on the outreach that I did to students along with the rest of the committee over the course of the past few months, that what we have seen and heard from Larry Bacow so far it seems like he is going to be a really good president,” Jasrasaria said. “Honestly, I haven’t heard much backlash—I think it might be because people know that I was on the committee and maybe aren’t telling me stuff.”
Historically, the Law School has shown a tendency to strike out on its own and occasionally depart from University-wide policy. Jacob R. Steiner, a third-year Law student who served as a Law School representative on the student advisory committee, said he thinks Bacow’s experience at HLS will translate into a deeper understanding of the school’s specific needs and a stronger relationship between the Law School and the University.
“I think we sort of see ourselves as a little bit more removed from the University than the other schools do and so I think it will be helpful to have a Law School graduate as the president—someone who understands the Law School, who understands its culture, and its history, and its independence but also is willing to push it more to integrate with the rest of the university and to encourage students to feel more like citizens of the University than they maybe do already,” Steiner said.

UPDATED: March 2, 2018 at 12:54 a.m.
Former Trump administration official Dina H. Powell will be a senior fellow at the Kennedy School for Government's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, the school announced last week.
Powell will serve as a non-resident fellow with the Future of Diplomacy Project, a program intended to study diplomacy and negotiation within international politics. She will also spend time with the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School.
Powell will also be joined at the Belfer Center by former UK shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander and former chief of M16 John Sawers. Rounding out the batch are Robert Dann, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Paula J. Dobriansky, chair of the National Board of Directors of the World Affairs Councils of America, Douglas Lute, former U.S. representative to NATO, Peter Ricketts, a life peer at the House of Lords, Radoslaw Sikorski, a “distinguished statesman” at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.
Powell previously served as deputy national security adviser for strategy under President Donald Trump until Jan. 2018. She advised Trump on foreign policy issues, with a particular focus on Middle East policy.
Powell planned to stay in Washington for only one year, unlike other recent administration officials who have departed the White House amid scandal or controversy.
Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen, director of the Center for Public Leadership, said she is one of the first officials to have benefited from working in the Trump administration.
“Not many people have been coming out of the Trump White House with their reputations enhanced, but Dina Powell is one of the exceptions,” Gergen said in an interview last week.
As founder and faculty director of the Future of Diplomacy Project, Kennedy School Professor R. Nicholas Burns first invited Powell to the Belfer Center. He said his decision to bring Powell to the Kennedy School was motivated by her experience in public service and her unique background.
“We wanted to bring her to Harvard because she's a distinguished person in her own right," Burns said.
Burns said Powell will come to the center once or twice a semester to lead study groups, speak in classes, meet individually with students, and attend public events. Burns said Powell will provide “an in-depth understanding” of what motivated the Trump Administration in its first year.
David Ignatius, a Washington Post columnist, and Jake Sullivan, a policy adviser in the Obama administration, are current senior fellows at the Belfer Center.
Powell’s appointment comes amidst a debate occuring at the Kennedy School over the inclusion of more conservative voices as fellows and speakers. Students have criticized invitations to prominent conservatives, most notably the Sept. 2017 visit of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and visiting fellowships offered to former Trump Administration officials Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski.
Burns said it is important for universities like Harvard to provide students with the opportunity to hear different perspectives on policy issues.
“It's important for any university, but certainly a university like Harvard, that we provide for our speakers, in our fellows, and in our students a full diversity of viewpoints on policy issues that our country has to grapple with,” Burns said. “We wouldn't be, I think, meeting the promise of our university if we only invited one type of person from one political party or from the left or from the right.”

Nina Srivastava ’18, a member of the student advisory committee for Harvard’s presidential search, declined to say whether newly selected University President Lawrence S. Bacow met the recommendations of the advisory body at an Undergraduate Council meeting Monday.
Nonetheless, Srivastava said she believed student input was valued by the group selecting the University’s 29th president.
“They were very genuinely interested in what we had to say and very open and willing to meet with us,” Srivastava said. “We, I think overall, throughout the process, felt very heard.”
Srivastava was one of three undergraduates on the student advisory committee, serving alongside students from most of Harvard’s graduate and professional schools. Srivastava declined to share the committee’s recommendations with the UC, saying she wanted to give Bacow an opportunity to see the advisory body’s recommendations first.
“We want him to hear our feedback first, and then we’ll go from there,” Srivastava said.
Srivastava added that her committee met with presidential search committee members on “multiple occasions” and she said she thought they were receptive to the advisory committee’s suggestions.
According to Srivastava, the advisory committee gathered student input through a variety of mediums, including multiple focus groups, a survey sent to all undergraduate and graduate students, and office hours. Srivastava said the survey reached about 4,000 students, representing a response rate of roughly 15 percent of students at the University.
UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said at the meeting that he and UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 met with Bacow last week, but declined to elaborate on the substance of their conversation.
“We’re very excited to be working with him,” Boucher said.
As the Council’s Finance Committee continues to grapple with a budget shortfall, some UC representatives urged the committee to look closely at its funding policies. For two consecutive weeks, the committee has been forced to make unusually large across-the-board cuts to grant funding after grant requests far exceeded the amount the committee had previously allocated.
The committee has already implemented two minor changes to help ameliorate its recent budget woes, including reducing the amount of funding large groups receive for transportation. The committee is also considering instituting a progressive cut to its grants, a policy that would fall disproportionately on student groups that request large sums of money from the UC.
Finance Committee member Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21 told Council members that the committee is looking “very, very, heavily” at its policy guide to try to save money wherever possible.
Winthrop House representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 warned the Council of the consequences of failing to adequately fulfill grant requests, suggesting that the UC’s reputation may be in danger.
“I think we need to do some very hard thinking, like as an entire Council, and not just FiCom,” Bonsall said. “Ultimately, the UC is virtually meaningless, I would argue, if we are not financially sound.”
The UC also passed legislation at the meeting to fund a town hall on education-related issues, which will be conducted in collaboration with student groups, including the Harvard College First Generation Student Union.
Education Committee chair Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said she hopes the town hall will help the committee better serve the needs of undergraduate students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate School of Design students penned a letter last week to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, criticizing his recent policies ahead of his visit to the school on Feb. 20.
The event, sponsored by the Graduate School of Design, the Joint Center for Housing Studies, and the Taubman Center for State and Local Government, will be moderated by Mohsen Mostafavi, dean of the Graduate School of Design.
The Harvard Urban Planning Organization and the GSD African American Student Union endorsed the open letter, which more than 30 students and Design School affiliates signed. The letter takes issue with the event’s description, which claims Chicago was “a great place to live, work, and play.”
“This erases how destructive Emanuel’s policies have been to Black and Brown residents of Chicago and to the City of Chicago as a whole,” students wrote in the letter. “As future and current designers, urban planners, policy-makers, organizers, and educators, we cannot disregard the people who are in danger because of Rahm Emanuel’s administration.”
Mayu Takeda, the co-president of the Harvard Urban Planning Organization, said the event did not extend the conversation far enough.
“We felt like we needed to have that kind of critical conversation that went beyond giving him this praise of making it a more livable, workable place to be because that is the description of the event,” Takeda said. “We felt that was not in line with what a lot of the students thought and what even a lot of people thought.”
In their letter, the students mention Emanuel’s 2013 decision to close 50 public schools in Chicago and four high schools in Englewood, a predominantly black neighborhood. The City of Chicago has since announced that only three Englewood high schools will close.
Students also criticized Emanuel’s decision to construct a new police academy, calling the choice an “egregious use of public funds” for a police department “notorious for its systematic brutality against Black residents of Chicago.”
Students also asserted that Chicago was “less affordable” than in the years previous to Emanuel's tenure.
Eric Williams, a signatory on the letter and a Loeb fellow at the GSD, grew up in Chicago and said the issues brought up in the letter are valid.
“There’s tons of cranes and investment in downtown Chicago, but we know the south and west sides of Chicago are not getting the same type of attention,” Williams said. “I think the things people are bringing up are very legitimate because we see these things playing out in the city right now.”
Marcus A. W. Mello, a co-president of the GSD African American Student Union, said design students were uniquely positioned to opine on these issues.
“I don’t think a lot of his policies have been favorable for the most-vulnerable constituents in Chicago,” Mello said. “I think that it’s important for us, especially as design students for a powerful and privileged institution like Harvard, to hold our politicians and our leaders to policies that promote equity and that really invest in the people that need it the most.”
The event’s sponsors did not immediately respond to request for comment.

That’s the only question that remains after host Harvard women's squash swept the competition this President’s Day weekend to secure its fourth consecutive College Squash Association (CSA) national championship and become the winningest franchise in women’s collegiate squash.
After breezing past No. 8 Cornell and No. 5 Yale, the Crimson faced third-ranked Trinity (15-3) in the packed Murr Center on Sunday afternoon in defense of its team championship. But hardly an hour and one wave into the match, sophomore Amelia Henley’s drop shot gave the team and home crowd its 18th Howe Cup to celebrate. Home makes winning sweeter, but Harvard had been hitting the sweet spot all year long.
Beyond all of the superlatives—perfect record (15-0, 7-0 Ivy), most women’s titles by a Crimson coach (six), and Ivy League Champions—this season has been defined by the sheer dominance of the team.
“The win this year was more about backing up what we had already achieved,” sophomore Gina Kennedy said.
For the first time in 15 years—and competing against the team that last accomplished the feat—Harvard swept all nine fixtures of the national championship. In the process, the Mike Way-coached team dropped just four individual matches the whole season and saw eight players end up with perfect individual match records.
Despite the pressure that the team faced as defending champions throughout the season, the performance against the Bantams may have been the Crimson’s best response yet. In previous matches against top teams in Trinity, Princeton, and Penn, one player faltered. This time, Harvard won 9-0. No individual match-up went beyond four games.
 “The team really put on a strong performance with all these expectations on top of us having won it the past few times and having a 50-match winning streak coming into the tournament,” No. 6 co-captain Sue Ann Yong said.
Junior Kayley Leonard completed a sweep of the all-important first wave with another one of her signature grinding victories in the third slot by winning a fourth-game tiebreaker against the Bantams’ Julia Le Coq. Leonard also headlined the first wave in last year’s national championship by completing a thrilling fifth-game comeback against Marie Stephan, which similarly brought the Crimson to the verge on victory.
But while the Harvard team is highlighted by four All-Americans and a reigning individual national champion in Kennedy, its strong depth meant wins came early and without much drama.
“What’s so cool about college squash is that it is not an individual sport anymore,” Yong said. “You aren’t representing yourself, but you’re representing a team.”
Each rung on the ladder is given the same amount of weight. Slots six and nine set the tone for the match as part of the first wave, and Trinity was given no semblance of an opening when Yong allowed her opponent just 12 total points across the three-game sweep.
 The glory would stay with the bottom half of the ladder. While No. 2 junior Sabrina Sobhy was coming close to ending her match at the glass court, No. 5 Henley fought off a first-game loss to bring her match to championship point at 10-3 in the fourth game against the Bantams’ Vanessa Raj. With the home crowd cheering, the two players took on a 30-shot rally that Raj eventually won. The crowd gave a round of applause in appreciation. The applause the point after was in celebration.
Taking the regular season’s results into consideration, many assumed the national championship would likely be retained by the Crimson. There was, instead, a shift in awareness to the setting of the title defense.
“It was nice for the seniors being able to have the final match on the home court," Kennedy said. “So, we were really excited about having a good atmosphere for our last game and pretty much the whole team’s families came over... There was very high morale going into the tournament.”
Trinity gave a valiant effort, but the NESCAC team was simply outclassed by Harvard. The Bantams could not match the depth of the Crimson, even had the Hartford, Conn. team run with Harvard’s top players. In any case, newly promoted No. 1 Kennedy was able to fight off Raneem Sharaf in three games (including a close 14-12 second game) to complete the uniform victory.
Thus began the day’s second big celebration: the end of the season, the start of reflection, and the continuation of a dynasty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Frank Keefe Trophy, after taking a slight detour in New Haven last year, is coming back to Cambridge.
After a week of tapering, the Ivy League Championship pitted the Ancient Eight against one another in a competitive contest at Blodgett Pool over four days stretching from Feb. 14 to the 17th. At the end of it all, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team took their third Ivy Crown in five years, accumulating 1616 points and beating the rest of the field by 125.5 points. Though tied with Yale after day one, the Crimson stretched its lead and ultimately finished with the first triple figure margin of victory for the Ivy League meet since 2013. The victory comes a year after the Bulldogs captured the meet, outpacing the rest of the field by 90 points.
“Last year, if you were to ask if we had a successful meet, I would have said definitely yes,” senior Alisha Mah said. “This year, it happened to come in our favor, and it was definitely sweet that it was at home, but I don’t think we did anything different except for swimming our hearts out and diving our hearts out.”
From the onset of the season, the team had its gaze on this pivotal meet.
“Our team in general has one goal, and that is to win the Ivy Championships,” captain Kristina Li said. “Everything that we do throughout the season, every single dual meet, every single practice, we have that goal in mind, and the takeaway is to never lose sight of your ultimate goal and see these individual events, these meets and practices, as stepping stones to the bigger goal.”
The Crimson came roaring out of the gate on the first day of championships, breaking the meet record in the 800-yard freestyle relay. Sophomore Miki Dahlke, freshman Kennidy Quist, captain Geordie Enoch, and junior Meagan Popp touched the finish in 7:05.06, more than six seconds faster than their seed time, eclipsing the meet record in the process. Harvard also captured first place in the 200-yard freestyle relay in 1:30.50 with the cohort of sophomore Mei Lynn Colby, freshman Ingrid Wall, sophomore Jerrica Li, and Dahlke anchoring
Dahlke would shine throughout the rest of the days of competition in individual events. The Mill Valley, Calif., native edged out Maddy Zimmerman from Yale in the 100-yard butterfly in 52.48. After finishing the race, she went on to set another pool record just a few minutes later in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:45.38. Quist was right behind with a time of 1:45.75, out touching Penn senior Virgina Burns by one one-hundreth of a second.
In the next day of competition, Dahlke tied a meet record in the 100-yard butterfly, finishing in 48.64. Dahlke also was part of the 400-yard medley and 400-yard freestyle, which both finished second. At the end of the meet, Dahlke was named the High Point Swimmer of the Meet.
“Her performance was electrifying,” Kristina said. “She was on fire this weekend. What’s great is that swimming is in some ways individual and in some ways team. In college swimming, you have one swimmer who is lights out and beating people out, and that gets everyone else fired up. Miki played a huge role in winning her events and scoring points but also inspiring us all to fight as much as she did.”
Enoch also posted strong performances, including a 1:59.67 in the 200-yard individual medley, propelling into first place. She also finished second in the 400-yard individual medley behind Princeton freshman Regan Barney and fourth in the 200-yard breaststroke.
The depth of the Harvard’s lineup was epitomized in the diving. In the one meter and three meter diving events, the Crimson slotted four divers in the top eight. In the one meter, junior Mikaela Thompson finished second with 288.85 points, and in three meter diving, Mah finished in third with 306.65 points.
“I think what we do in competition is really indicative of how we train in the sense that it was just another practice in our minds because there were so many of us in our home pool,” Mah said. “For the most part, it was very much another day at practice. These are our boards, this is what we do every single day, and just putting all those pieces together.”
Mah credits the supportive culture of the team to its success throughout the dual meet season and at the Ivy League meet.
“And I think that was why it worked out so well because we were celebrating every little victory, whether it be a touchout or doing something that we said we would do,” Mah said. “And I definitely am so proud of our team for doing that and giving it their all. I’m just so happy that all the pieces fell together.”
At the conclusion of the 21 events of the meet, Harvard held the Frank Keefe Trophy aloft as Ivy League Champions. Kristina, who finished off her 13 year swimming career with a fourth place finish in the 200-yard backstroke, acknowledges the deluge of emotion that the meet invoked.
“These careers have been so long, so obviously from just that itself, it’s very emotional to finish your last race or your last dive,” Kristina said. “Our freshman year, we had Ivies home as well, so everyone felt like it came full circle and back to where it all began. And obviously, to be able to finish off all of our seniors’ careers with a win in our home pool was such a special feeling, and so all of that culminated in so much emotion that last night. I know that I cried many, many times.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball recorded its first road win in conference play, but came up a rebound and a basket short of recording its first road sweep and practically guaranteeing its chances of making the Ivy League tournament.
Instead, the Crimson remain tied with Yale and Dartmouth with just four games remaining, with only two of the three teams able to advance to the Ivy League tournament in Philadelphia.
HARVARD 63, YALE 69
A back and forth affair in New Haven ended in agony for Harvard, who came up just short of sweeping the Bulldogs for the season, ending up on the wrong side of a 69-63 final.
The crucial play of the game came with under 30 seconds remaining, as Yale’s Tamara Simpson sat at the line for two free throws, with the Bulldogs (13-10, 6-4 Ivy) leading by just one point. Simpson, a 63 percent free throw shooter, erred on the first shot, then the second, seemingly leaving the door wide open for the Crimson (14-9, 6-4) to steal a victory.
Unfortunately, Simpson, attempting to atone for her missed free throws, tracked the second miss down as it clanged off the back heel of the rim and right to senior guard Tori Andrew.
Harvard, forced to foul again, would have no such luck the second time around, as Andrew knocked down a pair of shots from the penalty stripe. A miss by sharpshooting, sophomore Katie Benzan from three-point territory was corralled by Yale, and the game was effectively over.
“Pretty disappointing, but Yale is fighting for their lives, as were we,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said of Saturday’s loss. “I always am concerned about beating a team by 30, and then being on the road.”
Had Harvard been able to rebound Simpson’s miss, it would have trailed by one point with 20 seconds left, and been able to hold for a final shot to win the game. The failure to rebound was a cruel twist of fate for the Crimson, which dominated Brown on the glass the night before, and outrebounded the Bulldogs by six on Saturday night.
Saturday’s contest was a back-and-forth affair between the two rivals, nothing like the 97-73 win Harvard cruised to in the first meeting between the two. The game featured five ties and 10 lead changes, with the Crimson losing the turnover battle by a 13-7 margin, a familiar statistic in the losses the team has suffered this season.
“It was unfortunately the perfect storm, Yale played great to be honest, they had some kids knock down some big shots,” Delaney-Smith said. “Our kids played really hard too, it was just the perfect storm.”
Despite Harvard outshooting the Bulldogs by a 40-37 percent margin, and winning the rebound battle, the Crimson was unable to overcome Yale, anchored by Roxy Barahman and Jen Berkowitz, who combined for 37 points. Sydney Skinner and Taylor Rooks led the way with 13 apiece for Harvard.
HARVARD 86, BROWN 74
Harvard rode explosive shooting and domination on the glass to a 86-74 win over Brown in Providence, giving the Crimson its first road win of the Ivy League slate. The visitors shot an impressive 50 percent from the field, and outrebounded the Bears (14-9, 2-8) by a whopping 41-23 margin.
Although Harvard led by double digits for much of the third quarter, Brown refused to surrender, employing a full court press, forcing Harvard into turnovers and narrowing the lead to five.
But in the dying seconds of the third, Rooks converted from deep to give Harvard an eight-point lead entering the 4th quarter. The Crimson would fend off the Bears throughout the fourth quarter, knocking down key free throws to coast to a 12-point victory, its seventh straight win over Brown.
The Bears sat at 2-6 in conference play entering Friday night’s game, making the contest a do or die for Brown, with a loss likely eliminating the Bears from Ivy League tournament contention.
Harvard, who entered the matchup 0-3 on the road in Ancient Eight play, hoped to avoid the slow starts that had plagued the team away from Cambridge.
Rooks and Madeline Raster quickly obliged, knocking down a layup and drilling a three on the ensuing possession to give Harvard a quick 5-0 lead.
Despite early foul trouble for the Crimson, with starters Rooks and Kirby Porter with two fouls each in the first five minutes, the visitors’ bench production helped them pull away.
Freshman Jadyn Bush immediately contributed, converting two consecutive layups, the second one was followed by a free throw to complete the three-point play.
Layups from Skinner and Raster stretched the lead to 18-8, completing an 11-0 run, and Harvard would never trail after that point.
“Playing Brown at home, we played them really close,” Benzan said. “Friday night on their court, we knew we had to come out firing, and that’s how we came out.”
The Crimson’s depth overwhelmed Brown immediately, as the visitors rang up an 11-0 advantage in bench production, in the first quarter alone.
Jeannie Boehm returned from an injury scare at Penn, keeping Harvard’s lineup the same for the 23rd straight game. The sophomore forward from Winnetka, Ill., showed no ill effects of an injury, recording an early block down low, before converting on a sweet hook shot in the paint. Boehm finished with 11 points, finishing a rebound short of a double-double.
The Crimson also impressed on the defensive side, keying in on top scorers Shayna Mehta and Justine Gaziano. Mehta and Gaziano, each averaging over 18 points, were kept scoreless through the first 13 minutes of the game, and would score just four first half points combined.
Freshman guard Dominique Leonidas picked up much of Mehta and Gaziano’s slack Friday night, scoring a career-high 21 points on 8-12 shooting from the field, easily eclipsing her previous career high of 12.
Keeping Gaziano contained was especially crucial, as the sophomore from Natick, Mass., exploded for 28 points in the first meeting between the two teams, a 85-83 home win for Harvard. Gaziano would finish with just 13 points, many of them coming late into the fourth quarter.
On the offensive end, six players would score in double figures for the Crimson, with Benzan leading the way with 20 points on a familiarly impressive 7-9 shooting, knocking down 4-6 three pointers, chipping in four rebounds and four assists. Raster was also especially impressive, stuffing the stat sheet with nine rebounds, five assists, and two steals, to go along with 14 points.
With visits from conference leading Penn and Princeton looming next weekend, Harvard will put its home win streak dating back nearly a year, as well as its playoff chances, on the line.
“We just need a W,” Benzan said. “We’re working practice by practice, getting better every day, focusing on the little things, and hopefully those little things can add up to a win this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following last week’s win over Ivy League rival Brown, the Harvard wrestling team headed down to New York this past weekend to take on Columbia and Hofstra in their final two duels of the season.
The Crimson (6-4, 4-4 EIWA) finished the weekend with two wins—one against the Lions and one against the Pride.
HARVARD 25, HOFSTRA 9
Following its dual against the Lions, Harvard took to the road to compete against the Pride (10-10, 4-4) for a evening showdown. The Crimson dominated the competition, winning 8-of-10 matches to defeat Hofstra, 25-9, improving Harvard’s record to 6-4.
Crimson senior Tyler Tarsi won his second match of the day 6-4 against the Pride’s Ricky Stamm in the first overtime period. Senior co-captains Josef Johnson (174 pounds) and Kanon Dean (184 pounds) also had success in their matches. Johnson defeated Sage Heller 7-3 and Dean topped Cory Damiana 8-6.
At 125 pounds, junior Nolan Hellickson swept his opponent 12-0 and junior Ryan Friedman (133 pounds) won his bout 2-0. Two sophomores, A.J. Jaffe (141 pounds) and Hunter Ladnier (149 pounds), earned back-to-back wins in the match, beating their opponents Vinny Vespa and Ryan Burkert, 8-2 and 6-2, respectively.
“Guys on the team were pumped about this weekend,” Dean said. “Obviously, you always are when you come away with two wins, but I think the way in which we won against Columbia and Hofstra really spoke to how hard we’ve been training this year, and how everybody is committing to a high energy style with a lot of offense.”
HARVARD 18, COLUMBIA 13
Harvard performed well in its match earlier in the day as well against fellow Ivy League opponent the Lions (3-14, 0-5).
On Saturday afternoon, the Crimson defeated Columbia 18-13 in a match that went down to the last bout. The victory gives Harvard a perfect record in its last 3 matches.
The Crimson started off strong against the Lions with back-to-back wins by sophomore duo Jaffe and Ladnier. The duel between the two teams went back and forth and ultimately came down to the last match. At 133 lbs, Friedman came in clutch, sealing the dual meet win with a third period takedown to defeat the Lions’ Alec Kelly in the final minute of the match.
“Going into our last two matches, we knew we needed to win both to come out on top,” Friedman said. “Nolan [Hellickson] wrestled well and I just wanted to keep that momentum going. I gave up the first takedown but the coaches and so many Harvard fans were pushing me through the entire match. Coming out on top against an Ivy League rival was a great day for the program, and being in the situation I was in just makes it all the more special.”
Hellickson competed in the 125 weight class and won his bout 9-2 against Spencer Good. Tarsi defeated Columbia’s Laurence Kosoy in the 165 weight class in a sudden victory. Dean won his bout as well in the 184 weight class. During the match he was trailing by one with 12 seconds left, but earned the win with a takedown of the Lions’ Andrew Psomas.
The two wins helped boost the confidence of the team and prepared the Crimson for its next competition. It also motivated the team to stay on track mentally and physically as it prepares for EIWA Championships in two weeks.
“Obviously going 2-0 in a weekend, when our team has EIWAs in two weeks, gives us a lot of momentum going forward,” Friedman said. “The EIWA championships is what our team trains and focuses on peaking for the entire year. We are confident in our training and our coaches’ philosophy. Given the results from this weekend, our team is ready for EIWA in two weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard split their road trip this weekend against two ranked opponents, going 1-1 in the last two matches of the 2017-2018 regular season. The Crimson took down No. 8/8 St. Lawrence on Friday night in before falling to ECAC-leaders, No. 2/2 Clarkson by a score of 3-1 on Saturday evening.
The weekend’s results locked in Harvard’s seventh-place seeding in the ECAC, confirming that the team will be travelling to face No. 3/4 Colgate next weekend in a best of three series in the ECAC Quarterfinals.
HARVARD 1, CLARKSON 3
Harvard (13-14-2, 10-10-2 ECAC) dropped its regular season finale 3-1 versus the Golden Knights (29-4-1, 19-3) in Potsdam on Saturday night. This result ensured that the Crimson didn’t overtake Princeton for sixth place in the ECAC, thus killing any chance of an Ivy-League matchup versus No. 5 Cornell in the Quarterfinals.
Clarkson got on the board early, scoring on the first shift. With just 17 seconds played, the Golden Knights lit the lamp through Savannah Harmon after her shot slipped just past the glove of Harvard’s sophomore goalie, Beth Larcom. This was Clarkson’s quickest goal of the season, as well as the quickest goal that the Crimson have conceded this season.
Harvard was outshot 30-16 overall on the night, with both teams going 0-4 on power plays. Larcom ended with 27 saves in goal, making crucial stops throughout the night to keep the Crimson in the game.
The Golden Knights added a pair of scores in the second frame, all but ruining Harvard’s chances of taking the two points against the nation’s No. 2 team. Junior forward Bradley Fusco pulled one back for the Crimson before the end of the second, but Clarkson never looked in much danger of losing its lead. Despite the scoreline, Harvard defended well overall throughout the night, their defence combining for 17 blocked shots on the night, with freshman defender Emma Buckles leading the team with 5.
“They scored on our first shift, and that was kind of a wakeup call for us.” said junior captain and forward Kate Hallett. “From there on out, we really played well with them, and given that they’re ranked second in the nation, I think we have a lot of which to be proud.”
HARVARD 2, ST. LAWRENCE 1
Harvard defeated St. Lawrence (18-10-4, 14-6-2), 2-1 on Friday night. Freshman forward Becca Gilmore continued her impressive run, scoring both goals for the Crimson in the win.
Harvard were rewarded with a win for a disciplined performance against one of the nation’s top teams. The Crimson was penalized just once, when freshman forward Keely Moy was called for checking near the end of the second frame. 40 saves from Larcom also allowed Harvard to stay competitive and eventually edge out the Saints on the night, which was the Crimson’s first win against ranked opposition since February 2016.
Harvard broke the deadlock 8:46 into the second period, after Gilmore followed up on a rebound from freshman defenseman Emma Buckles to light the lamp. This scoreline would hold until the final two minutes of the game, when Gilmore found her second of the night on an empty net with 1:13 to play after St. Lawrence pulled their goalie. Gilmore’s two goals bring her tally up to 32 points on the year, an impressive haul for the freshman who leads the team in points.
The Saints got one back 30 seconds later to pull the score back to 2-1, but this proved to be too late in the game to mount a comeback. The Crimson was able to withstand the constant pressure on their goal to secure an important victory on the road.
“It’s never good when the opponent outshoots you, but if you can get through that adversity and capitalize, and play the defensive zone well, you can minimize their chances.” Gilmore said. “It was a pretty good game for us, a solid win against a ranked team definitely gave us some confidence.”

Blocking applications are just around the corner, which means unless you’re one of the lucky ones who has managed to secure a spot already, you’re probably making a mental list of people who might be desperate/charitable enough to admit you into their blocking group. Read on to find out just how easy it is to gloat (about your new blocking group) instead of float (in your team of one).
Make up some rumor about how n+1 is the best configuration for a river house.
Nothing strikes fear in a freshman’s heart quite like being quadded, so if your sorta-kinda friend Amanda tells you that her blocking group has five people, tell her that you’ve heard six people groups are less likely to be quadded. Then volunteer yourself as tribute. You’ll be a hero and the newly inducted member into a blocking group...that is, unless you all ultimately end up quadded, in which case, good luck explaining that.
Hand out resumés detailing why you would be the perfect blockmate.
Perfecting extensive resumés is what Harvard students do best, so why not create a list of reasons that no potential blocking group can turn down? Alternatively, casually slip your blockmate perks and assets into conversation whenever possible. E.g. “I bake all the time! I especially can’t wait to bake for my future blockmates!” 
Keep your ears open for any potential blocking group drama.
Ever hear that saying, “Where there’s a will there’s a way?” I prefer the saying, “Where there’s an opening, there’s your way [into that blocking group].” If poor Will finds himself kicked out of a blocking group, well, sorry Will, but there’s your way to procure yourself a solid group of blockmates (as long as they don’t boot you too).
Warning: While some of these tips will get you blocked, they may also get you blocked (on social media).
