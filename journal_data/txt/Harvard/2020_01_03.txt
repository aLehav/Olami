After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few remain who still haven’t heard of “Hamilton,” the musical-turned-cultural-phenomenon written by the legendary Lin-Manuel Miranda. Many people, however, do not know about what came before: “In the Heights,” Miranda’s first Tony award winning musical about an immigrant son and his vibrant Hispanic-American community set in Manhattan’s Washington Heights. And in just a few months, Miranda fans will be treated to a direct adaptation of the musical, directed by no other than “Crazy Rich Asians’” director John M. Chu. What a duo. Could a two minute trailer really do their combined genius justice? The answer is — apparently — yes!
The trailer opens with mysterious, pure, high-pitched tones and a dissolve shot of some kids running through the city streets. The scene then cuts to a gorgeous wide shot of a New York City intersection, water spraying all over and a crew of kids running into its center. Immediately, we get a sense of the trailer’s logic as a comingling of seriousness and frivolity.
The trailer picks up when Usnavi (Anthony Ramos) eventually enters the scene along with the rest of the cast, including Melissa Barrera as his romantic interest Vanessa and Dascha Polanco as Cuca. The fast paced cutting takes us from shot to shot of the lively life in the streets of Washington Heights — women booty bumping, people biking, friends high fiving at the local pool. All this is set to to the beat of the trailer’s music and the characters’ singing, asserting Washington Heights as a place where music and dance and life are one and the same.
All of a sudden, the crescendo is brought to a halt. The rhythms stop, there’s a shot of a vigil, and a man tells Usnavi, “the odds are against you.” Although we don’t know why, the change in tone is accomplished so effortlessly that it doesn’t matter.
And then Usnavi, in a moment of single-piano-note silence, asks, “But there’s a chance, right?”
With this line, just as seamlessly as it dipped, the trailer is on the up again. At one point, a character says, “They’re talking about kicking out all the dreamers.” This sentiment is followed by Usnavi’s community gathering and raising their countries’ flags, as well as shots of protest, play, and of course, a lot of song and dance. The trailer, in this way, reveals some of the political elements that will be at play ‘In the Heights,’ and ultimately conveys the power of community and art as methods of strength.
The trailer reflects this call for the coming together of people in the form of its own elegant marriage of music and dance, script and visual — where certain elements come to the fore or recede to the background with grace. The synchrony of the sequence makes the jumps from somber mystery to sorrowful uncertainty to booty bumping joy completely effortless. The seamlessness of these two minutes makes for a whole experience — if just this tidbit of Chu-Miranda content has us feeling all the feels, don’t you wonder what kind of life revelations a full two hours will inspire?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The holiday season is here again, and it is by turns a happy, hectic, and occasionally humdrum occasion — humdrum (not just for Scrooge) undoubtedly because variety is sometimes lacking. To be sure, there’s something to be said for putting up age-worn decorations, or for dutifully tuning in to an annual showing of “Home Alone.” What better time for tradition than the holidays? But every so often, a little change is in order, too. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the songs that accompany the holiday cheer. The same playlist of songs by the same crooning artists, played on the radio over and over again. Yet there’s much more to ring in the holidays –– take instrumental holiday music, which in its wordless wonder is usually lost amid giants like Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby. So here are five instrumental holiday albums that promise a little variety this season.
5. “A Dave Brubeck Christmas” (1996)
Famed jazz pianist Dave Brubeck’s solo album is the epitome of cool jazz. It’s relaxed and unornamented. Upbeat speeds and showy improvisations are nowhere to be found. Instead, Brubeck’s arrangements are measured and, in their own way, imaginative. Brubeck experiments with intricate rhythms and colorfully warm harmonies, which he pairs with an understated playing style. His rendition of “The Christmas Song,” for example, is stirring and sensitive. The result is easy and calming listening for a cold winter day.
4. “Christmas with the Vienna Boys Choir” (2009)
Technically, this is not instrumental, but let’s count choral music anyway. The renowned Vienna Boys Choir provides a more old fashioned holiday experience. There’s “Deck the Halls” and “The Little Drummer Boy,” but the rest are mostly traditional carols. “Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht” (Silent Night), “Adeste Fideles” (O Come, All Ye Faithful), and many others are rendered in pitch-perfect, four-part harmony. A mix of old and new, this time-tested chorus takes listeners on a stroll through tradition to today.
3. “Joy to the World” (1992)
Leave it to John Williams and the Boston Pops Orchestra to ring in the holidays with a soaring array of Christmas favorites. This album is filled with modern classics and more obscure numbers, all played with the grandeur of a classical orchestra and John Williams’s characteristic cinematic flair. “White Christmas” starts intimately and ends in triumphant celebration. The classic “Sleigh Ride” (fun fact: composed by Leroy Anderson ’29) exudes a childlike glee. Williams’s own “Somewhere in my Memory” (from “Home Alone”) sparkles with warmth. In sum, “comfort and joy” is in abundance with Williams and the Boston Pops.
2. Duke Ellington’s “The Nutcracker Suite” (1960) 
Tchaikovsky’s beloved ballet is a holiday staple across the world. Less so is jazz legend Duke Ellington’s take on it, but perhaps it should be. Ellington preserves Tchaikovsky’s sonorous melodies, but he isn’t afraid to re-envision them to his liking. Indeed, Ellington’s arrangements are swinging studies in musical individuality and harmonic creativity. In “Overture” or “Danse of the Floreadores” (his take on “Waltz of the Flowers”), Ellington plays with the rhythm and adds jazz-stapled harmonies. What results is an irresistible, distinctly American homage to a Russian holiday classic.
1. “A Charlie Brown Christmas” (1965) 
Parts of this album are definitely not obscure –– “Linus and Lucy” and “Christmastime is Here” are holiday staples –– but the Vince Guaraldi Trio’s whole album is worth a listen. From the swinging march of “My Little Drum” (a take on “Little Drummer Boy“) to the carefree fun of “Skating,” to the wistfulness of “The Christmas Song,” Guaraldi brings Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and all the rest to life. What’s more, he evokes a wealth of feelings that encompass the very spirit of the holidays. For listeners, “A Charlie Brown Christmas” will induce a dreamy reminisce to the simple nostalgic story of its namesake and to real, or imagined, days of yore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It finally happened: The 2010s came to a close, and with it, a plethora of literary trends. The decade began with the final installation of The Hunger Games trilogy, kicking off a multi-year infatuation in young adult literature with dystopian stories. Soon after, in 2012, YA was hit with another trendsetter, John Green’s “The Fault in Our Stars,” which introduced the bestselling but ultimately controversial genre of sick lit. With this decade also came the rise of e-readers like the Kindle and Nook, audiobooks that could be accessed through apps, book-related subscription services like Book of the Month, and Hollywood’s incessant need to adapt books new and old, proving all those wrong who were predicting that this was the decade that would make books obsolete. Luckily for me (and the rest of the reading world), books are better than ever. Here are the best 10 books of the 2010s — unranked, for my own sanity — according the Crimson’s ex-Books Executive.
“The Goldfinch” by Donna Tartt
For anyone yet to encounter Tartt, do yourself a favor and read the novel first. This 2013 release was adapted in 2019, but despite the star-studded cast and beautiful aesthetics, the movie was poorly reviewed by critics. The film’s main shortcoming is that it simply couldn’t do in 2.5 hours what Tartt manages in 780 pages. What feels shallow and unearned in the film is expanded to its full potential in the novel. To read “The Goldfinch” is a large undertaking, but worth the time. By the final page, it’s a hard goodbye to the characters that readers have seen grow up and grow old.
“Normal People” by Sally Rooney
After publishing only two novels, Rooney has been lauded as the “first great writer of the Millennial Generation” and “the Jane Austen of the precariat,” and for good reason. “Normal People” manages to capture the tumultuous feelings, both in relationships and in the job market, that Millennials attempted to come to terms with this decade. The prose is so clean and readable it’s almost as if you’re reading your own thoughts, and this is a book that simultaneously hurts to read and demands to be devoured in one day. It’s a beautiful trainwreck, and you can’t look away.
The Broken Earth trilogy by N. K. Jemisin
“The Fifth Season” won the Hugo Award in 2016, but what makes this sci-fi trilogy stand out from the rest of the Hugo winners from this decade is that Jemisin is the first writer in history to win the Hugo three years running, for every book in this series. This honor is not bestowed lightly: Each novel in this trilogy is equally heartbreaking. Jemisin manages to create a world both unrecognizable to us and yet scarily reminiscent of the worst parts of our history. The trilogy is the perfect example of the power of fiction, wrapped up in a story that is unlike any other.
“Pachinko” by Min Jin Lee
“Pachinko” is easily one of the best historical fiction novels of the decade and Lee spends nearly 500 pages detailing the lives of a Korean family in 20th century Japan. The novel spans decades and interrogates not just the secret histories of families, but also the complicated relationship between Koreans and the Japanese during the 1900s. Lee handles complex topics — from imperialism to racism to the pressures of family — with nuance and care, untangling the complex intricacies and presenting them to the reader without sounding didactic.
“Exit West” by Mohsin Hamid
Although it’s a short, slim book, “Exit West” packs a punch. The magical realism of portals in an unnamed city that open to places across the world may sound whimsical at first, but Hamid has carefully constructed a situation that poignantly accentuates the trials and tribulations of refugees. The novel is simultaneously about nothing in particular and about many humanitarian crises happening in the world. To top it all off, at the core of “Exit West” sits a romance that will leave readers’ hearts aching.
“Less” by Andrew Sean Greer
Most of the novels on this list deal with rather serious topics, but “Less” is the salve to heal all wounds. Although Greer doesn’t shy away from concepts like loneliness and sadness, he has also succeeded in writing possibly one of the funniest novels of the decade. In 2018, “Less” joined the very scarce ranks of satirical novels that have won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. “Less” is about aging, about being gay, about writing and traveling and figuring things out even after you probably already should know them, and by God, is it funny.
“All the Light We Cannot See” by Anthony Doerr
There are plenty of historical fiction novels set during World War II, but “All the Light We Cannot See” is certainly one of the best. It focuses on a blind French girl and a German boy with a knack for tinkering with radios. The novel revolves around children, but Doerr writes his young characters without oversimplifying anything — which is fitting considering the atrocities the children must face. This is a novel that does not hide the terrors of WWII, and yet at the center of it all there is a nugget of hope: Even as bad people live, the good are still out there.
“Americanah” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
Adichie challenges the notion that America is the land of promises and happiness for immigrants. Even as her main character Ifemelu, a Nigerian native, moves to America, gets an education, finds a job, and meets people she likes, she never seems completely happy. But then again, after many years Nigeria no longer begins to feel like Ifemelu’s home. Adichie captures the tension between wanting to live in America for “a better life” and what it means to give up the people, the culture, and the feeling of home.
“An American Marriage” by Tayari Jones
When Roy is wrongfully incarcerated for a rape he did not commit, things become difficult for him and his newly married wife, Celestial. On one hand, the story is perhaps one of the best (and most painful) explorations of love. On the other, this novel takes a deep dive into the problems of the mass incarceration of black people in America. “An American Marriage” is a tough read but a necessary one. Jones pulls back the curtain of America’s less-than-perfect justice system — and also, I would argue, of marriage and middle-class neighborhood politics — and what she reveals isn’t pretty. But look we must.
“The Power” by Naomi Alderman
What happened if one day we woke up and suddenly women had a dangerous power, the ability to electrocute and kill by a wave of their hand? “The Power” explores just that, imagining what would transpire if women just inherently had this kind of authority over men. Alderman doesn’t cough up many answers: some women would be kind or strive for equality, some women would exact revenge or take advantage of their newfound power. Instead, she simply shows what might unfold. “The Power” is a compelling inspection of gender roles and, more broadly, the ways humans wield power.

Deborah J. Gehrke, the “powerhouse” faculty dean of Quincy House, died at the age of 66 last week.
Born and raised in Illinois, she met her future husband and co-faculty dean, Lee Gehrke, in high school. The pair married in 1974 and moved to the Boston area several years later, where they would later raise a family and enter Quincy’s gates.
In an email Tuesday, Lee Gehrke described her as “kind, generous, non-judgemental, and endlessly forgiving” when it came to family, adding that she loved to entertain them. She made holidays “special,” he wrote, putting time and effort into decorations and preparing their favorite foods each year.
“She was deeply committed to her entire family, and especially to her four grandchildren,” he wrote.
The two have served as faculty dean for the past 12 years. Lee Gehrke wrote that she “tirelessly” worked to improve students’ lives, and that her “great intuition” for recognizing those struggling made her an enduring resource in students’ lives.
“She was above all a kind, thoughtful, and generous person,” he wrote. “She never retreated from a challenge and she often pushed herself out of her comfort zone.”
She easily mastered putting together house programming, thoughtfully listening to House members’ “concerns and interests,” he added. A passionate watercolorist, Deborah Gehrke often held paint nights for Quincy affiliates in the faculty dean’s residence. Last spring, she curated an exhibit in Quincy entitled “Small Watercolor Works.”
“Deb started sketching and painting as a child,” Lee Gehrke wrote. “Her artwork fell into ‘phases’...moving from oils to watercolors, often of landscapes, and more recently to mixed media and abstracts.”
She also had a strong “competitive spirit,” he added. During faculty dean open houses, she often wrote “Win Straus Cup” on every napkin before setting them out, referencing the annual interhouse intramural prize. Under the Gehrkes, Quincy House became Straus Cup champions for the first time ever in 2018.
Quincy House Resident Tutor Aaron I. Henricks ’16 said he also remembered Deborah Gehrke’s competitive side. Henricks, who lived in Quincy as an undergraduate, said that even though he did not live in Quincy in 2018, he knew the House’s intramural motto for that year was “do it for Deb.”
“She was a powerhouse,” he said. “That was legitimately a great incentive for everyone, because she's so loved by all the students.”
Henricks said he believes she played an integral role in forging strong relationships among Quincy residents.
“In the past few days since her passing, a lot of us — alumni and students and tutors — are struck by thinking about our time in Quincy and how many really close, lifelong relationships we formed there,” he said. “And I think that's in large part owed to Deb.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote about the College and Quincy’s “tremendous loss” due to Deborah Gehrke’s passing in an email to College affiliates Sunday. He added that the College will have a memorial gathering to celebrate her life in the spring semester.
“In the days ahead, I hope that we will do our best to live by Deb’s example, celebrating the gift of love and building communities of respect,” Khurana wrote. “By taking the time to get to know each other, and by taking care of those in need, we will honor Deb.”
Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, a faculty dean aide in Quincy, said he admired the way Deborah Gehrke fostered a house environment built upon encouragement and support.
“The Quincy community knew Deb as a coach, a cheerleader, an artist, a prankster, and a most imaginative creator of memories,” Biebelberg said. “She and Lee created a culture that made Quincy known as ‘The People’s House,’ where everyone is welcomed to the community and encouraged to be their best selves at Harvard.”
Matthew S. Miller ’21, a student in Quincy House, said he will fondly remember Deborah Gehrke as the “Fun Dean.”
“I will never forget how she came to our IM soccer games, cheering us on and bringing donuts for us after the game,” Miller said. “I still can’t believe how many events she planned for the Quincy students, from the ping pong tournament to the Lip Sync show to Field Day.”
Miller said her passion for embracing her role as faculty dean turned Quincy into a home for him.
“She made sure to look out for me and ask me how I was doing any time we crossed paths in the House,” Miller said. “From just one conversation, you could easily tell that Deb viewed being the faculty dean as her passion rather than as her job. The sense of loss I’m feeling right now is alleviated only in part by the privilege of having known her.”
In addition to her husband, Deborah Gehrke — who died of breast cancer on Dec. 25 — is survived by her two children and four grandchildren.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As members of Harvard’s graduate student union return to work after nearly a month on strike, labor experts say the union may have ended their record-setting demonstrations due to a variety of factors, including economic pressure and growing hopes of reaching a contract agreement.
Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers representatives announced in an email to union members Monday that strikers would return to work Jan. 1 without reaching a contract with the University.
Student workers began their strike on Dec. 3, the last day of the fall semester. Over the past several weeks, union workers have picketed in Harvard Yard and in the Longwood medical area, calling for the University to acquiesce to their demands in contract negotiations.
Mark G. Pearce — Executive Director of the Workers' Rights Institute at Georgetown University Law Center and a former Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that upholds U.S. labor law — said the strike may have ended due to financial considerations.
“Some strikes can last longer than others because there are strike funds available depending on the capabilities of the National Union,” Pearce said. “Other strikes fold because the economic pressure that ensues is too much for the strikers to withstand.”
William A. Herbert, Executive Director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions, a New York-based think tank, said he believed the agreement between the University and HGSU-UAW to enter federal mediation could be a reason the union decided to end the strike.
“A strike is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself,” Herbert said. “I suspect that the reason for ending the strike is that the ends of reaching most of what was being sought has been successful. And that now it's just trying to finish up and reach a final agreement.”
The union and the University agreed to engage federal mediators to facilitate collective bargaining between the University and the union beginning with their Jan. 7 negotiating session. In an email to members of HGSU-UAW, the union’s bargaining committee wrote that Harvard’s commitment to begin mediation served as a “new foundation to finish negotiations.”
Former NLRB Chairwoman and former Deputy Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Wilma B. Leibman said she believes it is a “very good sign” that the University and the union have agreed to federal mediation.
“The mediators certainly give it their all to try to help the parties reach an agreement, to try to find ways to deal with difficult issues that are really keeping them apart,” Leibman said. “It's entirely possible that the mediator got them to agree to stop the strike and give bargaining another chance.”
Pearce noted that federal mediation is often an effective way for both sides to reach an agreement.
“The mediator is always striving for a settlement, striving for the common ground in the negotiations, and sometimes a mediated process is the best way to get to that common ground,” Pearce said. “Oftentimes it's mediated negotiation that will bring to light that which would stimulate settlement.”
Experts also pointed to other challenges the union may face as potential factors in their decisionmaking, including a new rule proposed by the NLRB in late September that would reverse the decision that first granted graduate students the right to unionize.
Leibman said this proposed rule could affect bargaining between the University and HGSU-UAW.
“There's always the lingering question whether Harvard is going through this in good faith trying to reach an agreement, which I would hope, or whether they're trying to run out the clock until the NLRB does something, and then Harvard wouldn't be legally obliged to do something,” Leibman said.
Leibman added that the outcome of the negotiation sessions would rely on both parties’ willingness to negotiate.
“I would hope that both Harvard and the union really have a good faith effort to make collective bargaining work here… I’d like them to be able to show the Trump majority on the NLRB that collective bargaining can work,” she said.
Even if the NLRB’s proposed rule is implemented, Herbert said private sector institutions – including private universities like Harvard – have the option to “voluntary recognize” graduate student unions. In recent years, Brown University and Georgetown University both used the voluntary recognition process to facilitate collective bargaining with their graduate employees.
When the NLRB announced the new proposal, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain said Harvard was “reviewing the proposed rule” to establish how it may impact negotiations.
Even though the union ended its strike without reaching a contract, the strike set new records. HGSU-UAW went on strike for 29 days – from Dec. 3 to Dec. 31 – making it the longest strike in higher education since 2012, according to Herbert.
Regardless of the outcome, Pearce said HGSU-UAW’s strike showed the University the union’s solidarity and highlighted the University’s need for graduate student workers.
“The reason why there’s a right to strike is because it's designed to stimulate negotiations through economic pressure,” Pearce said. “If that is the result, then striking is worthwhile.”
Former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV said HGSU-UAW’s strike could have national implications for future actions by graduate workers.
“I think that it does demonstrate to both to Harvard itself and the country at large the seriousness and importance of these issues and the resolve of a union like this one to endure both hardship and delay in getting to its objective,” Gould said.

Bearing wind, rain, snow, and sleet on the picket line, striking members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers spent the month of December conducting the longest graduate student strike in recent history.
HGSU-UAW rang in the new year by returning to work Tuesday night, ending nearly a month of marching on Harvard’s campus, calling administrators, and arguing at the bargaining table. At points, hundreds of students and supporters joined the picket line.
Still, the union and University have yet to reach a contract. They remain at odds over the three provisions that prompted picketing: compensation, health care, and grievance procedures for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints.
The union first stepped toward the strike via an October authorization vote. The vote began Oct. 15, exactly one year after HGSU-UAW first met Harvard at the bargaining table. By Oct. 25, more than 90 percent of the union had voted in favor of the strike. Of the 2,682 members who cast ballots in the election, 90.4 percent voted in favor of withholding their labor, according to an email sent to HGSU-UAW members by the union’s bargaining committee.
Following the vote, HGSU-UAW announced that it would strike if negotiations were unable to reach a contract by the union’s deadline of Dec. 3.
As negotiations stalled, the union began picketing on Dec. 3, despite cold winds and snow. The demonstrators carried signs reading “UAW on Strike” and chanted “What do we want? Contract! When do we want it? Now!” Throughout the day, they transitioned between various marching routes in Harvard Yard with a strike headquarters located at the Phillips Brooks House.
The union also set up picket lines outside Harvard Yard. Student workers at the University's Longwood campus — home to the Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine — joined their Cambridge counterparts in strike activities, including hours of chanting, singing, marching, and daily rallies.
Picketers at Longwood chanted various science-themed slogans, shouting, “Put pipettes down! We need a contract now!” and “Hey, don’t make that buffer, while your fellow students suffer!”
The strike also had practical consequences for Harvard affiliates. Some classes collectively walked out of their lecture halls as part of a University-wide walk out held on the first day of the strike. Other courses cancelled review sessions and office hours and delayed grading course material and final exams.
Mail and package deliveries slowed as individual picketers attempted to block delivery entrances, asking drivers to withhold their deliveries. United Parcel Services stopped deliveries to Harvard in support of picketers, causing a delay in packages sent to the University’s Cambridge campus and several undergraduate Houses.
In addition to the mail deliveries, the graduate student union strike also disrupted BorrowDirect, a service that enables library borrowing across academic institutions in the United States. UPS delivers some of BorrowDirect’s mail.
Throughout the strike, several high-profile public figures participated alongside union members. United States Representatives Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Katherine Clark (D-Mass.); Massachusetts State Representative Marjorie C. Decker; then-Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern; Cambridge City Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui, Alanna M. Mallon, Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler; and Boston City Councilor Priscilla MacKenzie “Kenzie” Bok ’11 all picked up shifts on the picket line.
In addition, a number of Democratic presidential candidates took to Twitter to support the striking students. United States Senator and Harvard Law School professor emerita Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julían Castro, Mayor Pete P. M. Buttigieg ’04, and former Vice President Joe Biden all stood in solidarity with the union.
During the strike’s second week, academic departments across the University emailed graduate student teaching staff to ask whether they were participating in the strike, prompting outcry from some union members.
One memo — originally sent out to Government department affiliates by Chair Jeffry A. Frieden — was posted in part by union members on Twitter. Frieden informed graduate students that they are responsible for reporting whether they are working and that those who strike should not expect to be paid. He also reminded faculty that they are “management” and were still responsible for “instructional responsibilities.” In a separate email, the Government department asked graduate students teaching fellows whether or not they were striking.
In response, the HGSU-UAW organizing committee wrote letters to department chairs expressing concern about emails asking faculty members to report graduate students’ strike status. In a letter obtained by The Crimson, they stated that administrators may use such information to “dock students’ pay” and requested that chairs “proceed with more caution” when distributing work to department members.
More than a week after the strike began, the University and union had yet to announce plans to meet at the bargaining table again. They eventually scheduled a Dec. 18 bargaining session, marking the first meeting between the groups since just before the strike began.
The HGSU-UAW bargaining committee headed to the Dec. 18 session buoyed by cheers from rank-and-file members, but left disappointed. At the conclusion of that session, Harvard and the union reached tentative agreements on six contract provisions regarding discipline and discharge, strikes, grievance and arbitration, titles and classifications, an emergency grant, and housing. But none of the new agreements related to the issues at the heart of the strike.
The next day, though, the nature of negotiations changed. On the afternoon of Dec. 19, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced that the University would suggest engaging federal mediators in an attempt to reach a contract.
“Although these proposals reflect the University’s continued good-faith commitment to these negotiations – we have reached tentative agreements on 18 articles – movement has been minimal on remaining areas of substantial disagreement between the parties,” he wrote.
“Toward that goal, we believe that the parties would now be best served by utilizing the services of a mediator to help us resolve remaining issues,” Garber added.
Union organizers soon informed members in an email they had accepted Harvard’s proposal and scheduled a bargaining session for Jan. 7. They would later cite the change as a victory substantive enough to merit returning to work.
On Dec. 30, the HGSU-UAW bargaining committee emailed members announcing they planned to end the strike the next evening. Still without a contract agreement, they urged union members to continue expressing their displeasure to administrators until the clock struck midnight on New Year's Eve.
“In order to win a fair contract, we all will need to keep organizing together,” the group wrote. “And as we head into mediation, we look forward to continuing to fight for a more just and equitable university with all of you.”

Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern announced in a letter posted Thursday that he will not seek re-election as mayor, instead endorsing City Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui for mayor.
McGovern has served three terms as a councilor and four terms on the Cambridge School Committee. In a letter published in Cambridge Day, McGovern confirmed that he will continue to work as a councilor in his fourth term.
In an interview with The Crimson Thursday, McGovern cited tradition as his principal reason for not seeking reelection.
“It’s been almost 20 years that anyone has served as mayor two terms in a row,” McGovern said. “It’s sort of a practice.”
The former mayor said in the interview that Siddiqui — who is finishing her first term as a City Councilor — has done a “tremendous job” and would bring a unique perspective to important issues in Cambridge as mayor.
“We’re dealing with a lot of questions around race and racism,” he said. “I think having a woman of color who grew up in public housing, who knows this community inside and out, is going to bring a perspective to that conversation that is going to be really valuable.”
Siddiqui will begin her second term on the City Council next year. Prior to serving as a City Councilor, she graduated from Northwestern's Pritzker School of Law and worked as a legal aide. She has focused on issues of affordable housing, civic engagement, and support for small businesses throughout her career, according to her City Council website.
Siddiqui could not immediately be reached for comment.
In his interview with The Crimson, McGovern also described the issues he found most pressing during his term that will continue to require attention in the future, including affordable housing and climate change.
“We have affordable housing issues, we have homelessness issues, we have climate issues, we have far too many people in our community who aren’t accessing the prosperity that exists in our city,” he said. “I know that Councilor Siddiqui cares about those things as much as I do."
McGovern said he was proud of what he accomplished during his term, especially when it came to issues of “social and economic justice.”
“We brought free breakfast to every student in the Cambridge public schools,” McGovern said. “We opened the first warming center for the homeless.”
"It’s not just always the big stuff,” he added. “Whether it’s providing shelter or food or pathways to better jobs or helping people overcome substance use disorder — those are really tangible things that have made a difference in people’s lives, and I’m really, really proud of that.”
In his letter, McGovern also cited other accomplishments during his term, including expanding free lunch for public school students and launching the Immigration Legal Defense Fund.
In the final City Council meeting of 2019, Vice Mayor Jan Devereux praised McGovern’s accomplishments as mayor, saying that he “rose to this role with tremendous passion, enthusiasm, and gusto.”
The next mayor of Cambridge will be elected from the nine councilors next Monday during the City Council’s first meeting of the year. Days before the meeting, McGovern said that he remains committed to serving Cambridge.
“I’m passing the torch,” he said. “Being mayor was an absolute privilege and a dream come true for a kid who grew up here. Being on the council does not diminish my commitment to the social and economic justice issues that I’ve always fought for.”

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay will launch a review of the FAS tenure promotion process in response to a request by several faculty members, she wrote in a December email to those faculty.
The faculty members wrote to Gay Dec. 11 asking for a “comprehensive review of the tenure procedures in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,” which Gay agreed to Dec. 17, according to her email.
Gay wrote that she will define the review’s scope over the next few months and will convene a faculty advisory committee to assist with the effort during the 2020-2021 academic year. She added that she has asked Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser to plan the review.
The faculty members’ request for a review of the tenure process came shortly after the University denied tenure on Nov. 27 to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña, whose scholarship engages with race and ethnicity. By the time the faculty members sent their letter to Gay, hundreds of students and ethnic studies scholars within and outside Harvard had signed onto other letters condemning the University’s decision in the case.
Gay heads the Committee on Appointments and Promotions, which plays a major role in tenure decisions in FAS. She wrote in her letter that her experience at a “Demystifying CAP” workshop that she hosted for tenure-track faculty at the beginning of last semester convinced her to conduct a review.
“The session confirmed for me that there is much we might learn from a careful review of our practices and procedures, and that such a review is how we ensure that our approach to tenured appointments and promotions continues to serve our goal of building a strong faculty,” Gay wrote.
She added that the tenure-track system has improved since it was first formally adopted in 2005.
“It is meaningful that our promotion rates have risen significantly; that the FAS has achieved near-parity in its offers to ladder-faculty men and women; and that the FAS is stronger intellectually because of these developments,” Gay wrote. “Nonetheless, there is more we can do to make our system even better.”

Harvard's graduate student union strike has delayed the release of final grades in some fall semester courses, according to faculty.
Much of the responsibility for grading in courses at the College falls on graduate student teaching assistants, many of whom are members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. HGSU-UAW went on strike on the final day of classes, Dec. 3, over an impasse in contract negotiations with the University.
Striking HGSU-UAW members withheld their teaching responsibilities — including holding office hours, proctoring final exams, and grading assignments — during the strike. As a result, some professors modified the format of final exams or delayed grading them.
The strike, which later became the longest graduate student strike in recent history, concluded on Dec. 31 without a contract agreement.
Roughly 81 percent of grades for College courses were submitted to the Registrar’s Office as of Thursday morning, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane. Normally, 94 percent of grades would have been submitted by January 2.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences set a Dec. 27 deadline for professors to post grades online, though FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke wrote in an email to faculty on Dec. 4 that deadlines would not be enforced as normal due to the strike.
“We understand that there may be difficulty in meeting deadlines during the HGSU strike,” Burke wrote. “We are not going to send our usual set of deadline reminders as we do not wish to add to the stress of this period.”
Burke added that faculty should prioritize submitting the grades of “high priority students,” including students who plan to graduate early from the College in March and students with “unsatisfactory grades.”
Senior Preceptor Chase H. Harrison, who taught Government 1010: “Survey Research Methods” this past semester, said he followed the procedures Burke laid out in his email.
Harrison said that in his course — which 117 students took — approximately half of grades have been finalized. Two of the course’s four teaching assistants participated in the strike and did not grade the final papers. Harrison did not ask the non-striking teaching assistants to grade the extra sets of papers.
“I don't think that would be appropriate,” he said.
Philosophy professor David C. Lamberth wrote in an email that he did not replace the labor of striking student workers for his course General Education 1069: “Faith and Authenticity: Religion, Existentialism, and the Human Condition,” which he co-taught with Courtney B. Lamberth and Cornel R. West ’74.
“We were opposed to the idea of hiring replacement workers, and we ourselves did not want to replace the work of our Teaching Fellows,” Lamberth wrote.
Not all professors, however, opposed replacing the labor of their teaching assistants on strike. Former University President Lawrence H. Summers, who co-taught General Education 1120: “The Political Economy of Globalization,” wrote in an email that he paid his non-striking teaching fellows at overtime rates to help with grading.
“Finals needed to be graded,” Summers wrote in response to a question about the motivation behind his decision to hire additional labor. He declined to disclose the rate at which they were compensated.
Some professors indicated that they expect the teaching assistants in their courses who were on strike to fulfill their grading responsibilities now that the strike has concluded.
Harrison confirmed that the two teaching assistants in his course who participated in the union’s strike will grade final papers now that the strike has ended. He wrote in an email that he anticipates grading will be complete in roughly a week.
Germanic Languages and Literatures Professor Eric Rentschler, who teaches General Education 1043: “American Dreams Made in Hollywood,” wrote in an email to his students Wednesday that he intends to submit grades by Jan. 21.
“I have reached out to the course TFs and TA this morning in the hope that the people who know your work best will be the ones both to assess it and to submit a final grade reflective of all your endeavors in the course during the fall term,” Rentschler wrote.
Lamberth wrote that he was “operating with the expectation” that his teaching fellows would complete grading when the strike ended. He wrote to his teaching staff once the strike ended Wednesday and expects grading to be completed “relatively soon.”
Though the strike disrupted grading in his course, Lamberth wrote that the strike would “absolutely not” affect his views on hiring teaching fellows for future courses.
“The graduate students who serve as teaching fellows bring remarkable expertise and skills to our classrooms, and we very much value and appreciate everything they bring to our courses,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a brief hiatus, The Game will once again be played in the historic Harvard Stadium in 2020.
The Harvard football team has announced its schedule for the upcoming 2020 season, and along with it the location of the 137th playing of The Game. While last year’s contest was held at the Yale Bowl per tradition, Harvard’s hosting of the event in 2018 was located in Boston at the historic home of the Red Sox, Fenway Park. In 2020, however, The Game will return to a more familiar historic stadium.
The storied rivalry is the third-most played in Division I football, and the historic event broke tradition by playing at Fenway Park. The two academic powerhouses trade hosting the event each year, and Harvard’s turn in 2020 will once again be a true home game for the Crimson.
Harvard will also start its season at home, hosting Georgetown on September 19th to kick off the year. As in past seasons, the Crimson’s first Ivy League matchup will take place in its second week against Brown, this year on the road.
Harvard’s remaining road contests are against Cornell, Lafayette, Dartmouth, and Penn. The Crimson will host Holy Cross, Princeton, and Columbia in addition to its home games against Brown and Yale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One season ago, the Crimson’s Thanksgiving travels to California ended with an impressive win over Saint Mary’s, but left the team just 1-1 on the trip after a disappointing comeback effort fell four points short against the San Francisco Dons.
13 months later, Harvard men’s basketball (10-4, 0-0 Ivy) bookended a perfect 4-0 road trip with a nail-biting victory against those same Dons in the very same building, extending the team’s season-high win streak to five games. In doing so, the Crimson triumphed over a solid team that had already beaten Ivy League foes Princeton and Yale, just 24 hours after knocking off the California Golden Bears in Berkeley.
The game was a see-saw affair, with Harvard leading San Francisco (11-4, 0-0 WCC) for most of Sunday evening’s contest. After uncharacteristically struggling from beyond the arc all evening, the Dons leaned on a late spree of three-point shooting and a full-court press to even the contest. San Francisco even had a chance to win at the buzzer, but a Jordan Ratinho three-pointer flew off the rim, sending the game to overtime for an extra five minutes of play.
After 40 hard minutes the prior afternoon in a contest that the Crimson eventually held onto over Cal by a 71-63 scoreline, the overtime period could have spelled disaster for the visitors. But back-to-back baskets by senior guard Christian Juzang — including a dagger triple inside the last two minutes — helped seal a suspenseful and exhilarating 84-81 victory for Coach Amaker’s team.
“Honestly we just had to fight through fatigue, this was one of those games when everyone had to be ready,” admitted junior guard Rio Haskett about the toll of the Dons’ full-court press and comeback effort. “I think it was just mental toughness and staying connected, that was a big emphasis this week.”
Haskett played a crucial role in seeing out Sunday night’s victory, playing a season-high 28 minutes and scoring 11 points, including a crucial 3-of-4 from beyond the arc. Haskett’s three-point shooting has been a revelation for Harvard this season, as the Richmond, Va., native has found the basket on over 45 percent of his triples, after converting around 33 percent of them in both of his prior seasons.
“It’s mostly my team and Coach, just telling me to be shot ready,” said Haskett, quick to credit the others on the court for helping him find open looks. “I’ve been shooting well all season, so they just told me to step into it and shoot it with confidence.”
Coach Amaker and the Crimson will hope that beating San Francisco, widely considered to be a growing mid-major power in the West Coast Conference, will be a sign of good things to come as Ancient Eight play approaches. Perhaps more importantly, the victory over the Dons and the trip as a whole, including two victories over George Washington and Howard, demonstrated two of Amaker’s favorite themes: bench and balance, and the next-man-up mentality that the Crimson frequently look to emulate.
Just 20 minutes into the four-game road trip, guard Bryce Aiken exited Harvard’s first matchup against George Washington with what was later diagnosed as an injured foot. And while the team may have lost its top scorer, Amaker’s team was forced to look elsewhere for scoring. In doing so, the Crimson’s four-game road trip featured a different hero on a nightly basis, from senior Chris Lewis, to fellow classmate Christian Juzang, and other role players like Haskett.
In Aiken’s stead stepped Juzang, a fourth-year who is more than familiar with the role of starting point-guard, having previously replaced Harvard’s star guard for nearly a full season. Despite a stretch of play in November during which the Tarzana, Calif., native played fewer than 10 minutes in four consecutive games, Juzang’s play in his return to The Golden State was pivotal. The fourth-year scored 14 points against Cal and 17 against the Dons, drilling 5-of-9 threes in the two-game swing and playing at least 33 minutes in both victories, with no moment as large as his clutch overtime three-pointer against San Francisco.
“He has an unshakable confidence, and I love that about him,” said Coach Amaker of the senior, who has stepped into the starting role seamlessly. “He thrives on those moments where it’s a big play or a big shot, and he’s delivered for us… he’s been the guy who’s stepped in for us and provided that leadership and big play-making moments, so I’m very, very proud of him.”
Although Aiken’s timetable for his return is unknown, Juzang’s ability to capably helm Amaker’s offense in his fourth season is beyond a shadow of a doubt. After starting 21 games in his sophomore season, and 25 contests last year, the adjustment to playing off of the bench and staying prepared when his number is called is not one that has changed the senior’s attitude.
“Definitely not the easiest thing in the world, but that’s something I pride myself on,” said Juzang of his move to coming off the bench earlier in the season. “I’ve been here before, where nothing was guaranteed, and you know, fresh and ready when my number’s called and I’m glad I was able to show everybody.”
With Juzang manning the point, Harvard was able to knock off George Washington and Howard on back-to-back days, before flying to California and doing the same to Cal-Berkeley and USF. With the victories, the Crimson were able to extend its winning streak to five games, dating back to disappointing losses to Maryland and USC at the Orlando Invitational over Thanksgiving.
In fact, by knocking off Cal, Harvard secured a second victory against a Power Five school this season, after beating Texas A&M earlier in the season. The last time Coach Amaker’s team achieved the feat was during the 2013-2014 season, a campaign that saw the Crimson go 13-1 in Ivy play before knocking off Cincinnati in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament, before losing to blue bloods Michigan State. The victory also gave Harvard its first win over Pac-12 opposition since the 2012 season.
With one final non-conference game looming in the form of a visit from UC Irvine this Saturday, Harvard has a very real possibility of entering Ivy League play with a six-game winning streak intact.
And although the status of Aiken leaves some questions as Ancient Eight play approaches, Amaker’s rotation of Juzang, Justin Bassey, Lewis, Noah Kirkwood, and Robert Baker, complemented by Haskett, Danilo Djuricic, Mason Forbes, Chris Ledlum and others off of the bench, is gaining steam.
On any even given night, it can be a different hero for the Crimson. And by winning over solid teams, Harvard may be able to find the unique blend of confident starters and solid bench play, that will surely be required to knock off Yale, Penn, and the other Ivy League contenders in 2020. The side begins conference play against Dartmouth on January 18th.
Questions may still remain about this Crimson team, but after a 4-0 road-trip and a five game win streak, the red-eye flight back to the East Coast will surely have been a satisfying one for Amaker and Harvard men’s basketball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a dominant 5-0-0 start to the season, Harvard dropped its next four games. With only two games to go before winter break, however, the Crimson mustered a road sweep to push its record to 7-4-0 before the holidays. On New Year’s Eve, Harvard managed to continue its momentum from the first semester—and then some. Facing off against the No. 9/9 Boston College Eagles on the road, the Crimson scored early and often, stretching the margin to a 7-1 victory by the time the final buzzer had sounded. With the statement win in the books, Harvard will divert its attention back to ECAC play in a two-game home set against Union and Rensselaer (RPI).
HARVARD 7, BOSTON COLLEGE 1
The Crimson not only started the scoring early but even found the back of the net within the first 90 seconds of game time. After flipping a defensive zone faceoff into an offensive rush, first-year forward Shannon Hollands completed a breakout pass through the neutral zone to sophomore forward Anne Bloomer. Bloomer did the rest, skating the puck into the zone, dipping below the faceoff dot, and shoveling a backhand top-shelf over the arm of Eagles sophomore netminder Kelly Pickreign.
“She [Hollands] gave me a really nice pass,” Bloomer said. “I saw that there was an opening, tried to move my feet as fast as I could, and just put it on net. And it ended up going in.”
The Harvard offensive would not end in the first minutes, however, as the team managed to push its lead to 3-0 by the midway point of the first period, including a highlight-reel tic-tac-toe passing play on the third goal. On this scoring play, pushing towards the net, first-year forward Courtney Hyland curled back towards the blue line before dishing to junior forward Becca Gilmore. Gilmore moved the puck right away to co-captain and forward Kat Hughes, who received the feed and redirected it into the net in one continuous motion, capping off the 3-0 lead that would hold through the first intermission.
The Crimson would score another two unanswered until Boston College struck in the third to cut the lead to 5-1. Despite the Eagle response, the margin widened again for Harvard in the latter half of the final frame as sophomore forwards Dominique Petrie and Kristin Della Rovere both added their second tallies of the game to set the final score at 7-1.
The fast start, notable not only because of the strength of the opponent but also because of the length of the layoff leading into the game, played a crucial role in the Crimson victory. Harvard had not played since Dec. 7, and neither had Boston College. Rust may have played a role in the slow start for the Eagles, but the Crimson seemed to avoid the pitfall of the long break.
“Our whole team was prepared for that game,” Bloomer said. “We had been working really hard before, during, and after winter break. We had high energy the couple of days before… To strike early was huge in taking the momentum and setting the tone for the rest of the game.”
Despite Crimson’s lead in the scoreline, Boston College actually controlled the shots-on-goal battle in the game, 46-27. In fact, the Eagles led Harvard in shots in each of the three periods. Nonetheless, the Crimson still managed to earn solid possession (aided by a 39-28 faceoff win margin) and converted on the chances created. That said, keeping Boston College at one goal depended on much more than offensive efficiency, boiling down to a stout defensive and goaltending effort. Indeed, sophomore goalie Lindsay Reed posted a 0.978 save percentage on the day, giving the team some leeway to take chances on the offensive side of the ice.
“Our defensive play was great, and our goaltending was awesome,” Bloomer said. “Everything starts with defense. If you play solid defense, it makes it easier to get offensive momentum going. If you play well defensively, it gives a lot of confidence to the team and demoralizes the opponent...It’s always been a focus of our team to have a really strong [defensive] core, and things will feed and build off of that.”
THE WEEKEND AHEAD
Although Boston College struggled on Tuesday, the Eagles still do boast a strong record (11-7-2, 10-5-1 Hockey East). Harvard’s weekend opponents, however, have not fared as well. The Engineers of RPI are seeking their first win of the season, and the Dutchwomen of Union have a 2-4-1 record in the ECAC but have struggled to find the win column in non-conference play.
In last year’s matchups, the Crimson did perform well, going 4-0 in the two pairs of games against the two teams, managing to defeat Union by four-goal margins twice (4-0 and 5-1). RPI, however, fought hard to 2-0 and 2-1 losses to Harvard, revealing the parity between the two teams just a year ago. Obviously, a lot can change in a year, and the Crimson has had the privilege of returning the vast majority of its roster while many of its opponents have not. Even still, while Harvard and its weekend foes do have very different records, the familiarity of conference play still unites them, presenting a challenge for all involved.
“It’s really important to not take any of these league games for granted, especially with the strength and the overall level of the ECAC,” Bloomer said. “It’s one of the best leagues in the NCAA. Everyone is going to give you a battle every weekend. We have to come in prepared like we always do… Any team can win on any day. It’s important that we never underestimate any team.”
In fact, in the fall semester, Harvard almost saw firsthand how any team can win on any day. While the Engineers do sit in last place in the ECAC, the Brown Bears, a team the Crimson has played twice already this season, sits in second-to-last. Harvard did win both contests, thus preserving its 8-4-0, 7-0-0 ECAC record. In doing so, the Crimson earned a 4-1 victory in the first matchup with Brown, but even that game entered the third period 2-1 before Harvard pulled away to the 4-1 final. What’s more, in the second game, the Bears clawed back to force overtime before the Crimson escaped with a 3-2 triumph in the extra session.
Moreover, while the New Year’s Eve tilt with the Eagles did mark a success for the Crimson, the Harvard shots-on-goal deficit is a trend to watch. Going back to last season, the team has struggled at times to keep pace with its opponents scoring attempts. Earlier this year, when Harvard squared off against national powerhouses, No. 1/1 Wisconsin and No. 2/2 Minnesota, in the Country Classic outside of Nashville, Tenn., the Crimson managed to hang around until the third period of both games. Eventually, however, both the Badgers and Gophers mounted huge shots-on-goal advantages, 57-15 and 43-21 respectively, wearing down Harvard and allowing the nation’s top two teams to convert tight games into comfortable final margins (Wisconsin won 5-1, and Minnesota won 4-0). On the other hand, in the aforementioned 4-1 victory over Brown (not the overtime sequel), the Crimson pummeled the Bears in shots-on-goal, 59-14, guiding it to victory in a game that remained close otherwise.
Granted, the Crimson has proven it can achieve high offensive efficiency, averaging 3.58 goals/game on the season, and the defense and goaltending can certainly sustain shots deficits. And despite struggles in generating shots in some games, the team has averaged 30.2 shots/game for the season, so at other times, the team has gotten plenty of pucks to the net. Nonetheless, playing a simple offensive game that funnels chances to the goalmouth remains a focus and has been key to success when the team performs well.
“It’s important to come up hot right off the bat and to get the first couple of shots on net,” Bloomer said. “It helps when you just fire pucks on the goalie right away...not to overthink things but to play our game and play Harvard hockey.”
As mentioned, the Crimson offense has been approaching four goals/game for the 2019-20 campaign, a major improvement on the 2.31 goals/game average from last season. Outside of volume, however, Harvard has also shown balance in its offense. After all, on New Year’s Eve, 11 Harvard skaters appeared on the scoresheet, and three different players recorded multi-goal games (Hughes, Petrie, Della Rovere). On the season, the team has six players who already have double-digit point totals—through just 12 games. To continue winning ways into the weekend’s RPI and Union games, the Crimson will be looking to maintain a balanced attack.
“When we play our best, we get a ton of people, a ton of lines scoring,” Bloomer said. “We use our depth really well. We have a lot of talented players on our team—a lot of players that can play different roles...plenty of players who can score.”
Harvard will face Union first at 6:00 p.m. on Friday and then turn its attention to RPI at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. The Crimson will be looking to remain undefeated in conference play in the process.
