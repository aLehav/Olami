After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than two years of straight-to-streaming premieres, cinema shutdowns, and grave prognostication that the theatrical experience is dead, the May 21 premiere of Ruben Östund’s “Triangle of Sadness” jolted the 2022 Cannes Film Festival like a shot of adrenaline. From the early moments of the premiere-day press screening, the Debussy Theater echoed with riotous laughter and shocked murmurs; the enthralled audience reaction was the most engaged of any screening I personally attended, and it illustrates how the fresh hilarity, excellent performances, and vicious satire of “Triangle” hit home.
Where Östlund’s acclaimed previous films “Force Majeure” and “The Square” (a prior Palme D’or winner) present subtle, comedic commentaries on falsity, ego, and cowardice in elite circles, “Triangle of Sadness” throws subtlety overboard, embracing complete narrative absurdity while drawing cringe-inducing depth from its lead performers. But despite their stylistic differences, all of Östlund’s films share a central conceit: They draw sharp satisfaction from making rich people uncomfortable. In this film, Östlund ratchets their discomfort up to hallucinatory heights, weaving a mesmerizing and uproariously funny tale about the depravity of wealth, the exploitation of beauty, and the existential nightmare of cruise ships.
The film starts by following C-list male model Carl (Harris Dickinson) as he navigates a casting call, answers questions about the modeling world for a rude YouTuber, and gets relegated to a back row for his more successful girlfriend Yaya’s (Charlbi Dean) runway show. As Östlund introduces the couple, the thematic center of the film emerges. Yaya is perfectly content to conform to unequal power dynamics when it benefits her, whether she’s leveraging her beauty to make a living in the hierarchical modeling world or letting Carl buy things for her, but Carl feels uneasy about the financial expectations placed on him as a man. As he professes during an ingenious, thrillingly unhinged early argument over a restaurant check, Carl says he wants a truly equal partnership. At least, he wants that in the abstract — until the events of the film force him to choose between using his own beauty to get ahead (and surpass Yaya in status) or giving up his advantages to remain equal.
In the end — spoiler alert, although through Östlund’s lens this is more a fact of life than a plot specific — the allure of advantage is too high. As “Triangle of Sadness” progresses, the couple embarks on a luxurious cruise gifted to Yaya because of her internet following. Onboard, they’re greeted by an ensemble of oligarchs, socialites, and modern-day robber barons, who are as enjoyable company as one might expect. As the trip proceeds to go horribly wrong, Östlund puts Carl’s ideals to the test, weaving a darkly funny, biting portrait of hierarchy, privilege, and self-preservation.
Whether it’s rich people paying for the obedience of others, models vying to couple up with powerful people, or powerful people openly exploiting models, Östlund’s film illustrates the incompatibility of capitalism and social equality. In a world (or luxury ship, or island) where people must compete for resources, those on top — initially the awful billionaires, and then someone else after a series of dramatic mishaps — decide other peoples’ fates, and everyone inevitably uses their individual assets to vy for favor.
The film’s occasional moments of dramatic depth, mainly arising from its hilarious portrayal of Carl and Yaya’s hopelessly superficial relationship and their clash with cruise-worker-turned-leader Abigail (Dolly de Leon), deftly reinforce its political critique, showing how the demands and privileges of beauty follow them everywhere. A trio of grounded, earnest performances from Dickinson, Dean, and de Leon (who together are more poisonously discordant than their alliterative names suggest) center the film amidst the circus of hysterical characters and plot, preventing a farce. Thanks to their performances, the often heavy-handed satire avoids the smug obviousness of recent commentary comedies like “Don’t Look Up.” (“Triangle of Sadness” is also much, much funnier, so the comparison feels unfair.)
That’s not to say Östlund eschews low-hanging fruit altogether — in some moments, he tries to wring humor from juvenile gags that go on too long, mainly the seasickness crisis that seizes the cruise ship when the vengeful Marxist captain, Thomas Smith (Woody Harrelson), plans a feast during a storm. The cruise guests, of course, start throwing up everywhere, leading to what felt like a half hour (although it probably spanned fifteen long, repetitive minutes) of gross-out scenes that quickly get boring. Other jokes fall flat or feel tone-deaf, including the film’s depiction of a wheelchair-using guest (played by Iris Berben) whose immobility is mined for cheap laughs during the seasickness disaster and the guest’s later stay on an island.
Clocking in at nearly two and half hours, the film also feels longer than necessary. It’s comprised of three location-oriented sagas (in the London modeling world, on the cruise ship, and then on an isolated island) that are riotously entertaining but eventually circuitous. It’s hard to imagine what Östlund plans to add to the theatrical cut, which he has said will be longer, or whether audiences will want to sit through a three-hour film that makes its point in its first ninety minutes.
Overall, though, Östlund’s film soars far beyond these weaknesses, bitingly conveying the dual moral rot and real-world uselessness of the uber-rich and showing how billionaires live above the rules but have little to actually offer society. As some commentators have pointed out online, the film’s broad “power corrupts” argument may not be the most precise or revolutionary — but the film’s excoriation of the wealthy is undeniably important in a world where exploitative billionaires hold the world’s economies in a vice grip, deciding the fates of billions of people.
Beyond its portrayal of wealth, the film’s more specific critique of exploitative beauty culture feels unique for the contemporary cinematic landscape: The movie illustrates how Western society rewards, exploits or mistreats people according to their adherence to ridiculous beauty norms. Though the film is a political satire that may feel superficial when held up to the interpersonal dramas filling the festival lineup, its messages are no less important. Nowhere is its relevance more evident than the Festival de Cannes, a veritable who’s who of yacht-owning billionaires with a world-famous red carpet where celebrity appearances are telegraphed around the world to be dissected. It’s a great irony that this critique of capital took home the Palme d’Or, the top award at a festival known for its exorbitant displays of wealth, although perhaps it speaks to the disconnect between the film-focused jury and the broader culture around the festival.
Then again, as Östlund illustrates, the rich are full of contradictions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University holds the human remains of at least 19 individuals who were likely enslaved and almost 7,000 Native Americans — collections that represent “the University’s engagement and complicity” with slavery and colonialism, according to a draft University report obtained by The Crimson.
The unfinalized draft report, produced by a committee charged with studying how Harvard should treat human remains in its museum collections, calls on the University to return the remains of individuals who were likely enslaved to their descendants — one of 13 initial recommendations. It also urges the school to accelerate its return of Native American human remains, which has been required by federal law since 1990.
The draft report, obtained by The Crimson last month, was created by the University’s Steering Committee on Human Remains in Harvard Museum Collections, which was formed in January 2021. The draft, dated April 19, is unfinalized, meaning its language, findings, and recommendations may change as the steering committee finishes its process.
Still, the draft report offers insight into the work of a committee grappling with one of the most fraught ethical questions Harvard faces today.
“Our collection of these particular human remains is a striking representation of structural and institutional racism and its long half-life,” the draft report’s introduction reads.
In a statement Monday, the steering committee’s chair, professor Evelynn M. Hammonds, wrote that “it is deeply frustrating that the Harvard Crimson chose to release an initial and incomplete draft report of the Committee on Human Remains.”
“Releasing this draft is irresponsible reporting and robs the Committee of finalizing its report and associated actions, and puts in jeopardy the thoughtful engagement of the Harvard community in its release,” Hammonds wrote. “Further, it shares an outdated version with the Harvard community that does not reflect weeks of additional information and Committee work.”
The steering committee was created after a review of the Peabody Museum of Ethnology and Archaeology found the museum housed the human remains of at least 15 individuals of African descent who were likely alive when slavery was legal in the United States. University President Lawrence S. Bacow apologized “for Harvard’s role in collection practices that placed the academic enterprise above respect for the dead and human decency.”
Bacow charged the steering committee with comprehensively surveying all human remains in Harvard’s museum collections, developing a new school-wide policy on the stewardship of the remains, and creating processes to address memorials and possible returns.
The draft report listed 16 committee members, including faculty, administrators, and museum staff. The group includes several prominent scholars, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., Philip J. Deloria, and Randall L. Kennedy.
“The members of this Committee have been working tirelessly together to address a highly sensitive and important topic within the Harvard community,” Hammonds wrote. “The Committee has been working with the utmost respect for the subject matter and the individuals addressed, as noted in the leaked report.”
The committee focused primarily on the human remains of Native Americans and 19 individuals who may have been enslaved, held principally in the Peabody.
“They were obtained under the violent and inhumane regimes of slavery and colonialism; they represent the University’s engagement and complicity in these categorically immoral systems,” the draft report says. “Moreover, we know that skeletal remains were utilized to promote spurious and racist ideas of difference to confirm existing social hierarchies and structures.”
Harvard’s vast museum collections contain approximately 30 million items and specimens, including the remains of more than 22,000 individuals. The draft report recommends the University create a new Human Remains Returns Committee to determine how the school should treat the human remains of non-Native people and individuals who were not enslaved.
In addition to the 15 individuals who were likely enslaved within the United States identified in the Peabody’s initial review, the committee discovered four individuals from the Caribbean and Brazil — areas closely associated with the trans-Atlantic slave trade — who were also likely enslaved, bringing the total to 19.
“For too long, these remains have been separated from their individuality, their history, and their communities,” the draft report reads. “To restore those connections will require further provenance research and community consultation. In addition, research might include DNA or other analysis for the express purpose of identifying lineal descendants.”
The committee defined “descendants” broadly: The draft report says descendant communities should be consulted about return options when the University cannot locate lineal descendants.
“The best outcome of provenance research would be identification of lineal descendants but, if that is not possible, research should aim to ascertain descendant or affinity groups that have a direct social, emotional, family, or place-based connection to the individual, that is people who feel a direct responsibility or interest in the individual themselves,” the draft report reads.
Returns could mean the transfer of the remains to descendants, burial at an appropriate cemetery, repatriation of the remains to the individuals’ “home communities,” or continued care at Harvard upon request, the draft report says.
Since 1990, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has required institutions that receive federal funding to return Native American cultural items to their original owners’ descendants. The Peabody Museum has a committee that processes returns under NAGPRA, but the museum has yet to return the remains of nearly 7,000 Native Americans, per the draft report.
On the same day Bacow convened the steering committee, Peabody Director Jane Pickering — a member of the group — apologized “for the practices that led to the Peabody’s large collection of Native American human remains and funerary objects” — an apology she said was long overdue.
In addition to the return of human remains, the draft report calls on Harvard to create “a purpose-designed, on-campus space” where human remains can be respectfully viewed and studied and to develop courses that explore “problematic collections and how they reflect the University’s history.”
The draft report also says Harvard should review its practices for teaching and research involving human remains and work to memorialize the individuals whose remains have been kept in University museums.
“Treating the remains of all individuals as a single group for the purposes of memorialization is problematic and disrespectful,” it reads. “The University’s focus should be on restoring individuality as far as possible through provenance research to open the possibilities of engaging specific, appropriate communities to consider memorialization.”
In her statement Monday, Hammonds wrote that the committee intends to release its report publicly once it concludes its work.
“On behalf of the University, we apologize to those parties who will be negatively impacted by the draft’s premature release by the Harvard Crimson,” she wrote. “Once the Committee is ready to release our final report and recommendations, we look forward to the University sharing it publicly in a responsible and inclusive manner.”
