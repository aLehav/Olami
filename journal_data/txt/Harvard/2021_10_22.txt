After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To students, teachers, peers, and the Harvard community: This is my official farewell to the pre-medical track here at Harvard. I hope it finds you well.
While this isn’t just another story about the toxicity of pre-med culture, getting weeded out, or leaving my academic path for some earth-shattering love of another aspiration, it is a story of how white supremacy lives and breathes in each of our bodies, spreading between each of us — body to body — like contagion. It is a story of trying to mitigate chronic pain to create the possibility for genuine healing and recovery. A story of a great act of resistance: a Black woman choosing herself.
I took an inorganic chemistry exam the same day that a grand jury failed to charge two police officers with the murder of Breonna Taylor. That day, my body inhaled molecules of white supremacy as they seeped out of my computer from that proctored Zoom room. They entered my bloodstream and catalyzed a metabolism that would allow for the invasion of my body by a violently infectious life form. A chronic pain, caused by the perpetuation of lethally unjust practices and compounded by the silence and avoidance between myself and my educators when it comes to Black women’s lives, would make its way through and onto neighboring cells within my physical being. The presence of the germ of white supremacy would cause a steric hindrance within me, slowing down and even preventing the reactions of learning and healing that I desperately needed for myself and from others in that moment. The exam began, and I haven’t been able to show up mentally or emotionally in a science class since.
When white supremacy invades the bodies of those of us who dare to be Black, female, and breathing, it reproduces as a crippling affliction that accompanies us everywhere — physically, psychologically, and spiritually. The weeks I had spent preparing for that exam could never amount to the time and energy I have spent mourning Breonna Taylor. The time I would spend understanding electrons and balancing reactions would never amount to the years I have spent watching those whose skin was saturated with melanin like mine lose their lives. I held study sessions for myself alongside silent prayer recitations for the justice I knew would probably never come. And still, I showed up to my exam — in all my Black womanness — despite the heartache that would be ignored, unseen, and unacknowledged.
I could have asked to take that inorganic chemistry exam another day, but it would have required me to release my breath to plead for the need to catch it. I could have put my racial trauma on display to beg professors, teaching fellows, and preceptors to consider a Black woman’s funeral worthy of an excused absence, but I couldn’t bear the harrowing reality that I was mourning while white America was not. In the months to come, the symptoms of the infection of white supremacy — transmitted across bodies from professor to pupil, peer to peer, educators to learners — in the pre-med academic space sent me into a prolonged battle with recurring pain as I struggled with trying to fight, while also trying to survive.
I continued to show up as I did the day of that first exam because that is what good pre-med students do. What’s more is that it’s what Black women are supposed to do for everyone and everything, even at the cost of ourselves. So out of fear of what would happen if I didn’t persist — whose life I wouldn’t save, whom I would be doing a disservice — I kept choosing to put up with an affliction that didn’t serve me as fatigue and trauma reverberated within my body. Little did I realize that the most radical act of resistance would have been choosing my wellness and my health.
Thirteen months, two biology courses, one inorganic chemistry course, and half an organic chemistry course later, the germ of white supremacy still shows up in my body every time I enter the Science Center C lecture hall or its Zoom room equivalent. Written between my answers on every problem set and at the point of my pencil on every exam are the physical and psychological wounds marking my agonizing pain as it spreads through my body, agitating my brain and cramping the muscle that is my heart.
But no more. I have chosen a path to justice and healing that is rooted in self-love and preservation.
For Black women, self-care is an act of liberation. It disrupts systems of power — even at places like Harvard — that hold a stake in patriarchy and institutionalized racism. It is a way for us to free ourselves and dilute our pain from historical patterns of trauma caused by everyday violences. It is a crucial aspect of embracing and valuing our dignity and self-worth because trauma doesn’t have to be our destiny. We deserve to heal, to grow, to change. And sometimes it looks like distancing ourselves from potentially toxic, or infectious, scenarios or spaces to protect our energy and safeguard it for our own well-being.
And it’s as revolutionary as any path — career or otherwise — we could ever choose.

There is no greater financial mystery than Harvard’s endowment. However, conversations surrounding the endowments of elite institutions so far have been housed within the bounds of that institution — is it moral for a university to have that much money, what are they doing with that money? But this focus on the internal distorts the dialogue surrounding endowment, college rankings, and privilege, a much more complex conversation that involves deconstructing the supposed binary of the North having exceptional institutions of higher education and the South lacking them.
Harvard's endowment has increased from $41.9 billion to $53.2 billion in the span of a single year. Yale, MIT, Duke, and other wealthy universities announced similar to even greater returns on their own endowments. These values are so large that we grow desensitized to their financial scope; but, one look at the endowments of other universities, like historically Black colleges and universities (which are primarily concentrated in the South), brings to light the larger, cyclical theme of privilege and wealth disparities in higher education.
This concept of financial disparities in higher education between the North and South is beautifully explicated in the podcasts “Lord of the Rankings” and “Project Dillard” from Malcolm Gladwell’s Revisionist History.
A quick synopsis of these podcasts: Gladwell investigates the college ranking algorithm of U.S. News & World Report and finds that one of the biggest factors in determining a college or university’s position in the ranking is something called the “peer assessment” score. This score essentially has no academic grounds and is determined solely by the numerical ranking other university presidents, provosts, and heads of admissions at a comparative university give another university.
Gladwell finds that the vast majority of university leaders have no true knowledge of how to rank other universities, as they cannot adequately judge an institution they are not a part of. So, what many university leaders do is use their “gut feelings” to dictate the quality of another institution, done so on a simple one-to-five scale, with an option of “no response.”
Already, the way the largest determinant factor of the college ranking system is decided is questionable, but more questionable are the four variables that were found to predict 91.3 percent of the peer assessment score. These variables are: the size of an institution’s endowment, the percentage of students that are white, the percentage of students that receive Pell grants, and how much tuition costs.
The peer assessment score is a quantifiable value of reputation, and this score of reputation is a function of wealth. Endowment alone predicts roughly half of this peer assessment score, so for schools with big endowments, this is an ideal system. They are seen as even more reputable and prestigious with billions of dollars in private equity and hedge funds, which then turns into a consistently high peer assessment score and ranking in the U.S. News & World Report, but the immense wealth of these institutions cannot be divorced from the systematic financial disenfranchisement of HBCUs.
HBCUs are exceptional institutions of higher education that primarily serve a historically marginalized population in the United States; they have played and play a fundamental role in both our nation’s history and our future. In fact, while HBCUs make up only 3 percent of universities and colleges in the United States, they produce, according to UNCF, “almost 20 percent of all African American graduates and 25 percent of African American graduates in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.” They are renowned for their experiential and hands-on learning and how many judges, teachers, and doctors they have produced, all characteristics one would expect from a top-tier institution of higher education.
But, these universities and colleges are continuously excluded from the top spots of the college ranking system, largely because they fail to check the boxes and wealth and race that the U.S. News & World Report algorithm requires. For example, HBCUs do not have large endowments; in fact, in 2021, the cumulative HBCU endowment is $2 billion, a mere 4 percent of Harvard’s endowment alone. This negatively impacts how many students HBCUs are able to serve; the ability to provide financial support to students is largely determined by the size of an institution’s endowment, meaning that HBCUs, though their impact is unmatched, struggle to provide the same financial aid that institutions like Harvard and Williams are able to provide.
The entire college ranking system is a function of wealth that disenfranchises institutions that serve systematically marginalized communities (HBCUs) and elevates institutions (via the college rankings algorithm) that admit white, wealthy students.
The college ranking system upholds a system of wealth and white privilege, and it will take a recalibration of educational priorities to undo it. Rather than a peer assessment score that upholds the U.S. News & World Report rankings as a function of wealth, college rankings should begin to reflect the quality of education by deemphasizing variables like endowment, tuition, and other markers of affluence. Hyperfocusing on wealth as the determinate of the “best” institutions of higher education actively upholds a system that disenfranchises HBCUs and any institution that does not pander to the white and the wealthy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s strike season at Harvard. Last Wednesday, after six months of contentious negotiations, Harvard’s graduate student union announced its intention to engage in a three-day strike starting on Oct. 27 to eclipse freshman parents weekend.
The announcement comes as no surprise. The University seems unwilling to move towards a contract that would include graduate students’ fair requests — refusing to allow third-party arbitration for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, which Harvard’s internal processes have repeatedly mishandled, and offering nominal pay increases that fail to account for Cambridge’s rising cost of living. In September, faced with a seemingly insurmountable impasse, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers members voted overwhelmingly to authorize a potential strike; weeks later, amidst lackluster progress, that strike seems at our door.
We have repeatedly defended strikes as a worthwhile, powerful tool that can help level the socioeconomic playing field and secure more humane conditions. That attitude led us to support both the 2016 Harvard University Dining Services’ strike, which secured enduring health care benefits, and the 2019 graduate student strike. Our labor perspective this go around remains mostly unchanged: We are glad graduate students are once again fighting for well-deserved improvements in their work ecosystem. If no agreement is reached by next week (which, with no known federal mediation sessions left, looks inevitable) HGSU-UAW members can count on our support.
Yet our ideological and practical commitment to labor activism doesn’t mean we find the reality of experiencing a strike as undergraduate students ideal. After all, effective organizing is often disruptive — and union leadership has made clear that they intend to be “as disruptive as possible” this parent’s weekend. In an ideal world, the University would secure additional mediation dates and come back with a proposed contract that puts something meaty, like third-party discrimination and harassment mediation, on the table — all before a disruption to campus research and academics. But, despite the University’s preemptive bemoaning of the strike, we’re not holding our breath.
A strike will almost certainly take place next week — with consequences and real choices for all of us to contend with. Graduate students will be forced to choose whether to participate or not, a call that will affect the size, and hence impact, of the strike as much as it will impact their own relationship to superiors and students. Professors, many of whom are heavily reliant on graduate assistance, will be forced to conduct research without research assistants and to teach without teaching fellows. And our own peers, undergraduate students, will have to grapple with an impossible choice: skip class to support the union, as union leadership has asked us to do, or cross the picket line and attend it.
For a three-day window, our commitment to learning and our desire to support those who make that learning possible will prove incompatible.
This conflict stems from the idiosyncrasies of striking at an educational institution. Harvard is not an ordinary employer. A picketed store loses money because customers, seeing a strike, might choose to shop elsewhere. Withheld labor obviously hurts a business’s bottom line. But Harvard’s currency is the production and passing down of knowledge. The cost of a strike, then, must be to research and instruction.
Some students may choose to walk out of class during the strike to get out of an exam. Some might stay, fearing a recommendation letter they’re hoping to get out of a professor might suffer if not. And others will surely be on the picket line, chanting hand-in-hand with the union. We remain mindful of the complexities of each individual’s decision, understanding that those who do cross the picket line by attending this or that lecture might have more nuanced motives than a fervent anti-labor outlook.
The decisions posed by the strike put all of us in a delicate situation. Undergraduates stand to suffer from both underpaid, overworked instructors and from the absence of their teaching fellows and course assistants. Self-interest aside, we hope undergraduates are rooting for a surprise sidestep of a strike not just because they wish to evade disruption to their own academics, but because they’re invested in graduate student workers' fight for a better contract.
Next week won’t be ideal — it’s not meant to be. As the strike inches closer, we ask both graduate students and the institution that has forced their hand to remember the toll it will take on undergraduates, just like our peers should try to understand HGSU-UAW’s grievances as they wrestle with how to respond.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christopher C. Krebs, former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, spoke about the importance of securing democracy and the integrity of American elections at an Institute of Politics event Thursday.
The in-person event, entitled “Securing Democracy: Misinformation, Disinformation, and the Cyber-War for the 2022 Midterms,” explored the benefits and potential exploitations of technology in the American political system, as well as the role of government regulation. Joan Donovan, research director at the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, moderated the discussion with Krebs.
Krebs was fired by former U.S. president Donald Trump in November 2020, after his agency pushed back against Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud. The CISA originally intended to combat foreign interference, but shifted its focus to quelling misinformation campaigns within the U.S. after the president tried to sow distrust in the election's integrity.
As head of CISA, which is within the Department of Homeland Security, Krebs was the administration’s most senior cybersecurity expert.
Krebs, a founding partner at cybersecurity consultancy Krebs Stamos Group, argued during Thursday's event that the benefits of technology outweigh the downsides, even when considering misinformation.
Invoking the motto of her research lab, “everything open will be exploited,” Donovan asked Krebs how the digital election system should be secured.
In addition to ensuring that the country's elections are secure, Krebs said the nation's cybersecurity agency must also consider how people will exploit security concerns to further their political agenda.
“It wasn’t just about protecting the election systems,” Krebs said. “It was also realizing there would be people out there who would use the narrative that this is an attack to try to target fear.”
Krebs and Donovan also discussed whether technology should be considered "critical government infrastructure." The CISA identifies 16 critical infrastructure sectors — including the food and agriculture sector and the financial services sector — that are considered "so vital" to the U.S. that their impairment would severely endanger the nation's security and well-being, according to the agency's website.
Krebs said that the definition and role of critical infrastructure changes over time, but not everything may be as “critical” as it seems.
“We have to start thinking about those things as utilities, because we aggregate a risk that they present in a data center,” Krebs said regarding types of technology.
Asked how technology should be regulated, Krebs said he thinks government needs to collect more information before enacting policy.
“I don’t think we have enough information right now to make meaningful targeted policy,” Krebs said. “There should be caveats — there should be carve-outs — particularly talking about financials and advertisements.”
Donovan also highlighted political advertisements as an area for potential regulation.
“I think it would be a good bet to push for regulation that would at least regulate political ads in such ways for more transparency and how much was being spent,” Donovan said.
Krebs also spoke about his defense of the election system against Trump’s claims of voter fraud. He said his actions were “defending democracy.”
Krebs said that despite voter fraud concerns, the U.S. election system is secure.
“We’ve got a pretty resilient system: good indicators, good networks,” Krebs said.

After five months of negotiations, Harvard’s clerical and technical workers union, which represents more than 5,000 workers as the University’s largest union, reached a one-year tentative agreement with Harvard Wednesday.
The new tentative agreement includes percentage raises and increases to funding for member assistance programs, as well as an updated tax reimbursement program for tuition benefits, five extra retroactive Covid-19 paid sick days, a one-time bonus, and a new joint committee for diversity and inclusion. If the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers membership ratifies the agreement, the new contract will expire on Oct.1, 2022.
In a joint statement Thursday, Harvard and HUCTW highlighted the pay increases and program updates in the tentative agreement.
“We are pleased to announce that Harvard University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers (HUCTW) have reached agreement on a new one-year union contract,” the statement reads. “The Tentative Agreement provides for annual pay increases and bonuses, and includes updates on a number of policy issues of mutual interest to the Union and the University.”
The day before, in a separate email to membership, HUCTW’s negotiating team unanimously endorsed the tentative agreement.
The tentative agreement directly addresses concerns prioritized by HUCTW membership in a survey this summer: compensation, tuition assistance benefits, paid time off, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.
In the survey, approximately a fifth of respondents reported their personal income levels dropped during the pandemic, primarily from a loss in overtime. HUCTW members also reported losing 49 percent of their overtime pay, according to the survey.
The tentative agreement provides a 2.9 percent raise for members with one year of employment as of Oct. 1 and a prorated raise for members who have worked for less than a year. Members who have been employed for six months or more as of Oct. 1 will receive an additional lump sum bonus of $500.
HUCTW members also noted the tuition assistance program as an important issue in the survey. The program reduces the cost of taking courses at Harvard for employees, and 44 percent of respondents said it was an important motivator in their choice to work at Harvard.
Two years ago, to comply with IRS guidelines, Harvard began withholding tax on “non-job-related” courses that members took as part of the tuition assistance program, according to an email sent to HUCTW membership in July. Members, however, reported inconsistent standards for determining whether a course is “job-related,” the email stated.
The new tax assistance fund established in the tentative agreement will reimburse taxes for “non-job-related graduate courses,” according to the union’s Wednesday email. For consistency, Harvard will also provide the union and management with new guidelines about what qualifies under “job-related” classes.
The University will also raise funding for HUCTW and Harvard’s joint employee assistance programs, which cover areas such as child care, education, and transportation, to nearly $3 million, a 2.75 percent increase.
In the survey, 20 percent of respondents also reported having used more sick time to care for healthy dependents, mostly due to care or schooling closures related to Covid-19.
The agreement includes five retroactive Covid-19 sick days. Members can use these additional sick days to receive pay for Covid-related absences from April 2020 to the end of May 2021.
In terms of diversity and inclusion, 43 percent of survey respondents said they did not believe every staff member had an equal opportunity at success at the University. The tentative agreement includes two provisions on diversity and inclusion, establishing a new Harvard-HUCTW committee as well as updating contract language to be more equitable.
While HUCTW contracts are typically three years long, the tentative agreement is for one year. In an August interview, HUCTW president Carrie E. Barbash said a shorter contract would allow both parties to accommodate post-pandemic uncertainties.
“I think we’re both, right now, because of some of the uncertainty of return to total normality, still leaning towards a shorter contract,” she said.
In their announcement to members Wednesday, HUCTW leadership wrote the one-year duration is “the best strategic option.”
The tentative agreement now needs to be ratified by a majority of voters. In an emailed statement Wednesday, Barbash wrote the union’s elections committee will set a ratification vote date “as soon as possible,” likely in the coming weeks. The vote will be held online using a secure voting platform.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony S. Fauci discussed pandemic preparedness and racial health disparities in a virtual seminar on Thursday hosted by Harvard Medical School’s Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.
The webinar is part of Boston Medical Library’s annual lecture series named in memory of Joseph E. Garland, Class of 1915, who served as president of the Boston Medical Library and editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. The majority of the Boston Medical Library is housed in HMS’s Countway Library of Medicine, serving as a resource for medical schools across Boston.
In the webinar, Fauci reflected on lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic, highlighting the nation’s and the world’s strengths and failures in pandemic preparedness.
“I don’t think there’s much you can do about the emergence of an infection that jumps species and goes into the human environment, but you can prevent that outbreak from becoming a pandemic by early responsiveness,” he said.
“I think those are the things that we really have not done very well,” he added.
In sharp contrast to the shortcomings in local and domestic public health infrastructure, the U.S. demonstrated its prowess in science and research through the rapid development of a vaccine, according to Fauci.
“One of the big success stories of this outbreak has been our scientific preparedness, because the investment that has been made in the research that led to a vaccine in less than 11 months from identification of the sequence tells us that we were really on top of it when it came to scientific preparedness,” he said.
Fauci also said despite the World Health Organization’s missteps during the Covid-19 pandemic, he still believes in the need for an international health organization. He added that he believed the U.S.’s withdrawal from the WHO was a “real mistake.”
Regarding the national rate of vaccine hesitancy, Fauci noted his frustration at the “profound and intense divisiveness” he observed during the pandemic, saying political disputes have disrupted public health safety measures such as wearing masks and receiving vaccinations.
“When you have a public health crisis, there’s no doubt that the common enemy is the virus,” he said. “And yet, we, in this country, have been acting as if the enemy is each other.”
Despite the country’s lack of unity, Fauci said, there has been a commendable attempt at addressing racial health disparities, specifically in ensuring equitable recruitment of African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and other minority groups for vaccine clinical trials.
“In my mind, it sheds a very bright light on something we’ve known for a long period of time — that the social determinants of health put minorities at a disadvantage at virtually every type of disease,” he said.
Fauci said he believes the U.S. has a “moral obligation” to help developing countries that are suffering disproportionately from the virus.
“I think it’s an obligation of the developed world — including and particularly the United States, because we’re such a rich country — to do whatever we can to get doses of vaccine to the low and middle income countries,” he said.

Humanitarian and policy experts discussed how the Afghan refugee crisis and coronavirus pandemic precipitated forced migration to the Eastern Mediterranean region of Europe in a virtual panel hosted by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative Thursday.
Moderated by Harvard Humanitarian Initiative Director Irini Albanti, the panel featured Greek Minister of Migration and Asylum Notis Mitarachi, UN refugee agency representative in Greece Mireille Girard, and the Chief of Mission in Greece for the International Organization for Migration Gianluca Rocco.
The panel began with a discussion on the European Union's responsibility to Afghan refugees, many of whom fled to European nations following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and subsequent Taliban takeover in August.
Mitarachi said he believes the EU has a humanitarian responsiblity to help Afghan refugees.
“We need to have a more active stance with regard to migration. I do not think that Europe needs to become a closed Europe,” Mitarchi said. “On the contrary, we need more people in Europe. But we should get more people through legal pathways, and, in the cases of humanitarian crises like the one in Afghanistan, we should, again, allocate people throughout Europe in an organized way."
But Mitarchi also noted that there are limits to how many migrants Europe can accommodate.
“We cannot relocate 38 million people to Europe, obviously,” Mitarchi said. “We cannot take everyone out of Afghanistan and bring them into Europe.”
To help those who did not flee Afghanistan, Girard said, international agencies should address the lack of food and public services. She added that humanitarian actors are more present in Afghanistan post-withdrawal.
In addition to the Afghan refugee crisis, the coronavirus pandemic — “a crisis within a crisis,” Albanti said — has exacerbated forced migration challenges.
The coronavirus caused movements of people, Rocco said, who left their native countries to seek health care and treatment in areas with more robust health care systems. In such a way, Rocco noted, the coronavirus exposed the danger of vaccine hoarding.
“We cannot just take care of our countries and build walls and forget about those that on the other side,” Rocco said.
The dual crises have made some migrants’ trips more hazardous, the panelists noted.
“People are fleeing for their lives,” Girard said. “And they are taking increasingly dangerous routes.”
“When people have to save their lives, they take enormous risks for that,” she added.
Rocco said that the EU lacks coherent migration policies.
“We do not have a clear, transparent, and credible policy toward people to come to work or coming for different reasons into Europe,” Rocco said.
“This is creating a situation that goes to the detriment of the migrants themselves,” he added. “And on the other side, it doesn’t serve the states that are receiving or the European Union because we do need a labor force.”
Reflecting on the coronavirus and the broader plight of forced migrants, Girard summed up the state of forced migration in two words: “Exclusion kills."

Harvard Government professors and international journalists discussed the future of American foreign policy in the Middle East during an online event hosted by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs Thursday.
Moderated by Government professor Melani C. Cammett, the panel featured fellow Government professor Joshua D. Kertzer, Belfer Center Executive Director Natalie O. Colbert, CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward, the National Editor-in-Chief Mina Al-Oraibi, and Nabih Bulos, the Los Angeles Times' Middle East bureau chief.
The panelists spoke about the consequences of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East following the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and how China has undermined the U.S.'s long-time dominance in the region.
“The U.S. is no longer the only act in town,” Ward said. “People are looking around for other options, and other state actors who might be able to offer investment assistance.”
The panel also said the U.S. government's poorly misjudged the speed of the Taliban’s takeover.
“I was asked a day later on television, ‘Oh, they're saying now 30 days until Kabul falls,’” Ward said. “I said, ‘That's ludicrous, that's not possible.’ Three days later, Kabul fell.”
“I was also guilty of not understanding how quickly things were unraveling, but I don't have security clearance,” she added
Al-Oraibi said that the withdrawal of U.S. troops has further strained the nation's relationship with its closest military partners.
“Another trend that was accelerated by what we witnessed in Afghanistan was this idea that there was a distancing between America and its NATO allies,” Al-Oraibi said. “They were stunned by how the United States had gone about this and really hadn’t conferred with their allies who had fought side by side with them for two decades.”
The panelists also discussed climate change policy in the Middle East.
According to Colbert, the U.S. can play a leadership role in the Middle East by helping nations pursue reductions in emissions and investments in new energy economies.
“The leaders of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the [United Arab Emirates] were invited to President Biden's climate summit in April, and the UAE also hosted a climate dialogue in April, John Kerry attended,” she said.
“So you're seeing a lot of activity there that I do think suggests there's still a role for us to play on that topic as well, in the context of opportunities to stay engaged with the Middle East,” Colbert added.
In an interview after the event, Kertzer said the priorities of the U.S. public have largely shifted from the nation's foreign policy in the Middle East to issues at home.
“The United States spent trillions of dollars in Afghanistan and Iraq and it's unclear what they've got to show for it” Kertzer said. “In this sense, there is a less permissive political environment at home now than there would have been during the Clinton administration.”
“The domestic political calculus has also changed and this also affects what political leaders in Washington are going to be willing to spend political capital on,” he added.
Cammett, an academic, noted in a post-panel interview that she believes it is important to include journalists in discussions with academics.
“It is really good to be in dialogue with people that are witnessing the phenomena that we are writing about on the ground,” she said.
“I found that it was really valuable to see Professor Kertzer’s perspective on these questions about credibility and reputation and resolve and then have journalists on the ground tell us, ‘Well, here is what we see on these questions in the people we talk to,’” Cammett added.
Ward, the CNN correspondent, also said she believes it is essential to include journalists' perspectives in academic discussions.
“Often, what we want to believe is true about a certain place is not actually what things look like on the ground,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow joined Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and other officials to unveil four new all-electric shuttle buses at a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Science Center Plaza on Thursday morning.
The shuttles, which the University purchased in February to reduce its use of fossil fuels, will replace four bio-diesel buses that make up more than 30 percent of the bus fleet at Harvard.
The performance of the new shuttles — manufactured by Proterra, an electric vehicle technology company — will also inform future efforts to electrify transportation services across the University.
In an address at the ceremony, Bacow noted that Harvard has both “special burdens” and “special responsibilities” when it comes to its role in creating a sustainable future.
“​​We are excited by the opportunity that we have to make a difference here at Harvard, to see our campus as a living laboratory where we can both experiment and demonstrate best practices,” he said.
At the event, Siddiqui discussed climate change on both a global and local scale, including flood maps that predict large portions of Cambridge will be underwater in 2070.
“The news that the climate legislation coming out of Washington will not be nearly strong enough, it's easy to feel overwhelmed,” Siddiqui said. “It's a reminder that no one is going to solve this problem for us. Cambridge must lead.”
Harvard’s shuttle bus fleet has an annual ridership of about 600,000 across its campuses, per a press release from Harvard Campus Services. The eventual electrification of all its buses is expected to lead to annual reduction of more than 220,000 pounds of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.
In addition to lowering emissions, several speakers at the ceremony highlighted the impact of electrification on air quality and noise pollution.
“It's just better for everyone — less air pollution, less noise pollution — and believe me, in elected government, we get a lot of complaints around pollution,” Siddiqui said in an interview following the event. “I have so many complaints right now around noise pollution and specifically Harvard buses so this is great that Harvard is actively doing this.”
The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection helped fund the four electric shuttles with a $500,000 grant — part of a larger $7.5 million in funds to support nearly 100 similar projects across the Commonwealth, per a press release. A loan from the Harvard Green Revolving Fund also funded the electric charging infrastructure for the buses in Allston.
“The transportation sector accounts for 42 percent of the greenhouse gases that are emitted in Massachusetts,” Mass. DEP Deputy Commissioner Stephanie Cooper said in her speech. “This is a really important sector for all of us to do everything we can to reduce carbon pollution.”
Cooper noted that both Harvard and Massachusetts have a goal of carbon-neutrality by 2050. The University also has a goal of fossil-fuel neutrality by 2026.
These four electric shuttles won’t be the last for the University.
As a member of Recharge Massachusetts — an initiative that supports state organizations that use zero-emission vehicles for their operations — Harvard has pledged to implement a zero-emission vehicle action plan that includes replacing bio-diesel powered buses with 100 percent electric ones.
After the event, the sight of the buses parked on the Science Center Plaza piqued the curiosity of students who were travelling between classes.
“I was just out walking and I saw this and I think it's definitely overdue in terms of what Harvard should be doing,” Emmanuel C. Ngbemeneh ’22 said. “We share a lot about how we are producing more technologies and being more environmentally friendly, and I'm actually glad that we’re basically putting our money where our mouth is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the threat of a strike looming, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said Wednesday he remains hopeful Harvard can reach an agreement with its graduate student union to avoid a second walkout in two years.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers threatened to initiate a three-day strike on Oct. 27 if no agreement is reached with the University beforehand. Contract negotiations between Harvard and the union have stalled after seven months over issues including sexual harassment grievance policies and compensation.
Bacow said in an interview Wednesday that the University has collaborated with the graduate student union and plans to continue negotiating.
“We’ve made progress on many issues, and I certainly don’t think a strike is needed in order to come to agreement,” Bacow said. “It’s my hope and expectation that we will reach an agreement without a strike.”
Union leaders are less confident.
“We’re pretty far apart on some of the major issues that have been consistently negotiated out over at the bargaining table,” HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said in an interview Thursday.
Just one bargaining session remains before the Oct. 27 deadline, with another scheduled for that day.
“We’ll continue to negotiate in good faith as we have all along,” Bacow said. “And I believe that if both sides continue to negotiate in good faith, we’ll come to a contractual agreement. I think the University has, actually, a very good record of reaching agreements and labor contracts with all of its other unions.”
“I see no reason why we can’t reach one,” he added.
The deadlocked negotiations come less than two years after HGSU-UAW went on strike for 29 days in December 2019.
The University has long resisted the graduate student union’s calls to allow victims of sexual harassment the option of independent arbitration, arguing the move would violate federal Title IX regulations by providing inequitable processes for union and non-union students. Harvard has previously offered a plan that would allow student workers the ability to appeal cases not involving sexual harassment or gender-based claims to third-party arbitrators.
Mancilla said Thursday that the two sides remain “very far apart” on harassment procedures.
He also said the three-day strike, which would fall on the College’s freshman parents weekend, would result in “lots of disruption” if a deal is not reached.
“We, for all intensive purposes, are planning to be as public and as loud as possible during these days,” Mancilla said.
The University has been engaged in preparations for a possible strike since August.
Harvard is also in contract negotiations with two other unions — Service Employees International Union 32BJ and Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards Union.
On the eve of negotiations between Harvard and 32BJ, a group of custodians at the school rallied against their own union leadership, calling on the University to halt negotiations until intra-union conflicts are resolved.
Bacow said Wednesday that the dispute is “up to them to work out and resolve.”
“Sometimes the hardest negotiations that occur in labor negotiations occur on the same side of the bargaining table, not across the bargaining table,” Bacow said.
“We also have legal obligations in terms of whom we can bargain with, and that’s the legally elected representatives of the employees,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School assistant professor Renee N. Salas and lead author of the medical journal the Lancet's 2021 report on the world's progress in combating climate change presented its key findings at a Thursday event hosted by the American Public Health Association.
In addition to Salas, the virtual event featured Jeremy J. Hess, a senior author of the report and the director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington, and other experts in public health. The highly-anticipated report — known as the 2021 Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change Global Report — was released on Oct. 20.
The panelists worked through the contents of the report, which cautioned that climate change is having a severe and inequitable impact on human health around the world.
Per the medical journal, the report represents the findings of 38 academic institutions and UN agencies and assesses the world's progress toward achieving the Paris Agreement — the 2015 international treaty on climate change.
The 2021 report examines three types of natural disasters that result from climate change — extreme heat, droughts, and wildfires — and warns that the dire consequences of these threats are a “code red for a healthy future.”
The year 2020 was the second-hottest year on record since at least 1986, according to the report. Poor infrastructure and limited access to air conditioning have increased heat-related harms in certain regions across the country.
The panelists discussed the importance of short-term investments to increase access to technology that mitigates some of the risks of extreme heat, particularly among vulnerable populations.
Droughts have compounded heat-related illnesses, increased the risk of infectious diseases, reduced water quality, and worsened mental health, especially in rural areas, according to the Lancet report. The findings note that in 2019, nearly one-fifth of the planet's land surface was in extreme drought, undoing decades of progress toward decreasing food insecurity and water shortages.
Wildfires have also contributed to worsening air quality and other negative health effects that disportionately impact low-income communities and incarcerated persons in wildland firefighting programs, per the report. Smoke from wildfires can be 10 times more harmful than pollution from other sources, particularly because it can cause harm across larger swaths of the country.
As a result of the increasing frequency and impact of climate change-driven extreme heat, droughts, and wildfires, the policy brief component of the report recommended three focus areas for the U.S. government to take action.
Salas called on the government to rapidly increase public health funding, account for the “health-related costs of the burning of fossil fuels,” and cut greenhouse gas emissions, especially in areas stricken by air pollution.
Salas stressed the intersectionality of global health and climate change, and emphasized the importance of considering health impacts when making climate policy decisions.
“The take home message of this year’s brief is clear,” Salas said. “Climate change is first and foremost a health crisis unfolding right now in the United States. There is no safe temperature rise from a health standpoint, and every fraction of a degree matters for health and equity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What happens when an immovable object meets an unstoppable force? No. 16/RV Harvard (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) and No. 17/22 Princeton (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) will answer that question on Saturday at 1 p.m. when they face off at the Tigers’ home stadium in Princeton, N.J. The game, which serves as Princeton’s homecoming, may have massive implications on the ultimate Ivy League championship. Thus far this season, the Crimson and the Tigers have looked like arguably the two best teams in the Ancient Eight. Along with Dartmouth, Eastern Washington, North Dakota State, and Sam Houston, Harvard and Princeton are two of just six remaining undefeated teams in the Football Championship Series (FCS).
The Tigers represent the greatest challenge the Crimson has faced so far this year, and the two teams have notable statistical similarities. Both teams lean on their elite rush defenses. At the midway point of its season, Harvard’s defense has allowed an average of just 45.6 yards per game on the ground, which leads the Football Championship Series (FCS). However, Princeton is not far behind, ranking second with 54.4. Furthermore, both teams tie for second in the nation in sacks per game (4.0). With each school boasting a dominant front seven, the offensive lines will play a crucial role in determining which team will emerge victorious on Saturday.
This season, the Crimson offensive line has protected its quarterbacks effectively, yielding just six sacks in five games, tied for the 23rd stingiest rate in the country and pacing the Ivy League. Meanwhile, it has opened up enough holes for its talented trio of running backs to rack up 213.0 rushing yards per game, which ranks 15th in the FCS. In a 30-3 victory over Lafayette on Oct. 16, sophomore running back Aidan Borguet proved too elusive for the Leopards defense to track down, turning his 22 carries into 169 yards and finding the end zone twice. His performance was augmented by a solid showing from sophomore running back Sone Ntoh, who chipped in 51 yards and a score.
Harvard’s running game earned 229 yards against Lafayette despite missing its most valuable weapon, junior running back Aaron Shampklin. Shampklin, an all-Ivy League First Team selection in 2018, opened his 2021 campaign with 183 yards and two scores against Georgetown on Sept. 18 and has not looked back. This season, his 117.0 yards per game rank fourth in the country, and his 7.2 yards per carry rank fifth. He has also plunged into the end zone six times in four games, good enough for a share of 20th nationally. Head coach Tim Murphy held Shampklin out against the Leopards as an injury precaution.
If Shampklin can play against Princeton, he will face a Tigers defense that opened its season with two shutouts in a 32-0 win against Lehigh on Sept. 18 and a 63-0 trouncing of Stetson on Sept. 25. In those games, they yielded just one net rushing yard. Princeton is led by linebacker Jeremiah Tyler, who paced the team with 11 tackles in its most recent game, a 56-42 victory over Brown on Oct. 16. Tyler was one of two finalists for Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year in 2019 when he was unanimously selected to the All-Ivy League First Team. In addition to Tyler, defensive lineman Uche Ndukwe is enjoying a breakout season, ranking 14th in the FCS with 5.0 sacks. Defensive backs Ken Lim and Michael Ruttlen Jr. share the team lead with an interception apiece.
The Tigers enter the Harvard matchup with plenty of offensive momentum after torching the Brown defense to the tune of 650 yards and eight touchdowns. Running back Collin Eaddy contributed 130 yards on 15 carries and found the end zone four times. After notching three scores against Monmouth on Oct. 9, Eaddy enters the contest tied for fourth in the nation with ten rushing touchdowns this season. Princeton has ranked just 62nd in the FCS with 143.8 rushing yards per game, but it bettered that performance in its most recent game, rushing for 174 against the Bears.
“Yeah, for sure. We’re concerned about [Eaddy],” sophomore defensive lineman Nate Leskovec said. “We’re concerned about every player that we go against every week. We just have to make sure that we have a good, sound plan and attack their offense the right way, and I think we’ll be able to get that done.”
However, despite Eaddy’s brilliance, he might not have been the best player in the Tigers’ victory over Brown. Quarterback Cole Smith completed 25 of his 27 passes for 476 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions, including a 51-yard touchdown to wide receiver Dylan Classi. So far this season, Smith has thrown 10 touchdowns to just two interceptions, completing 69.7% of his passes and reaching the 400-yard plateau twice. His aerial efficiency could pose problems for the Crimson defense, which ranks just 65th in the country, allowing 222.8 passing yards per game. Smith has also turned his 42 carries into 62 rushing yards and two additional scores. Still, Leskovec was confident in defensive coordinator Scott Larkee’s game plan.
“Fortunately, we were able to play well against Lafayette, but Princeton’s a whole different type of opponent. We need to have a different plan to attack them,” Leskovec explained. “We’ve got a lot of good guys in our back end, and we’ve been fortunate to play with them. But it’s really just about getting pressure up front and making sure we’re getting to them with everything we can.”
Princeton’s offense boasts three talented wide receivers to complement Eaddy and Smith. Of Smith’s 1,514 passing yards this season, 1,271 have been earned by either Classi, Jacob Bermelin, or Andrei Iosivas. Each member of the trio gained at least 140 yards against the Bears, and Iosivas found the end zone twice, adding to his team-leading five touchdown catches. Bermelin, who leads the team with 528 receiving yards, was an All-Ivy League Second Team selection in 2019.
Although the Tigers present the most high-powered offense the Crimson has faced so far (455.2 total yards per game, ninth best in FCS), the Harvard squad is well-equipped with tools to defend Princeton. In addition to its stellar performance against the run, Harvard’s defense has also fared well against opposing quarterbacks, tying for 27th in the country with its seven interceptions. The impressive turnover haul has helped it rank third in total passing efficiency defense (97.75) despite its mid-pack ranking in passing yards allowed.
After intercepting two passes in the win over Lafayette, sophomore cornerback Alex Washington jumped into a share of the team lead with senior cornerback Khalid Thomas. Thomas is tied for tenth in FCS with 0.5 interceptions per game, and Washington is tied for 30th (0.4). Junior safety James Herring and senior linebacker Jordan Hill, the 147th captain of Harvard football, have each racked up 35 total tackles. Meanwhile, Leskovec leads the team in sacks, sharing 14th in the nation with 5.0. Junior defensive lineman Jacob Sykes has also contributed 4.5 (T-20th). The Crimson defensive line will look to attack a Princeton offensive line that has allowed 15 sacks already this season.
“[We have] really good coaching. We have twelve guys. ... We all do a really good job helping each other. It’s a really supportive system. I just do what I’m told from the coaches, and I get a lot of support from my teammates, and that’s a real blessing,” Leskovec said.
Offensive coordinator Mickey Fein’s unit will be led again by sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean, who threw for 147 yards against Lafayette. Dean’s best performance this season came in relief of senior quarterback Jake Smith in an Oct. 9 win over Cornell, when he completed 12 of his 21 passes for 204 yards and a touchdown, including a 75-yard strike to senior wide receiver BJ Watson. In addition to Watson, Dean’s top target is junior wide receiver Kym Wimberley, who leads the team with 198 yards and two touchdowns. Junior wide receiver Tyler Adams returned from an ACL injury in the Lafayette game to haul in his first two passes of the season and figures to factor in the Princeton game.
If Harvard wins on Saturday afternoon, its 6-0 record would mark its best season-opening stretch since 2015, when it won its first eight games of the season en route to its most recent Ivy League title. The Crimson has won each of its first six games five times this century, going on to win the Ancient Eight in four of those years (2001, 2004, 2014, and 2015). To match this feat and make significant progress towards its 18th conference championship, it will have to win in a stadium where it lost in 2019, against an opponent that has traditionally posed issues: the Tigers hold the overall lead in the series, 57-48-7.
The next two weeks will be crucial for Murphy’s chances of claiming his tenth Ivy League title. Regardless of the result against Princeton, Harvard will have to face RV/No. 25 Dartmouth, which will come to Harvard Stadium on Oct. 30. The Big Green is also 2-0 within the conference, and 5-0 overall, and will face Columbia this Saturday. Regardless of whether or not Dartmouth is able to defeat the Lions, the Oct. 30 matchup will have massive implications on the overall Ivy League championship. However, despite the gauntlet that the team faces, the Crimson is confident that it can step up in the face of the pressure and deliver two crucial victories.
“There’s definitely nerves for every game. The pressure to play the best you can and to not let your teammates down is something that all athletes deal with,” Leskovec admitted. “I think the thing that helps to mitigate the nerves is to really know your job and then know that if you do mess up, you have to get better on the next play, one, and two, that there are good players all over the field that can help you when you’re down.”
Saturday’s game will be streamed on ESPN+ and carried at Bloomberg WRCA (1330 AM/106.4 FM).
