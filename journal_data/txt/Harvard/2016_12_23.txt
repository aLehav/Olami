After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This is my story now,” declares the heiress Maud Lilly (Christina Bennett Lind) with a chilling note in her high, tremulous voice in the second act of the American Repertory Theater’s “Fingersmith.” Indeed, there is plenty of fourth-wall-breaking tug-of-war over who gets to be the main character of this Gothic Victorian thriller, the main contenders being Sue Trinder (Tracee Chimo), a tomboyish orphan nicknamed “Fingersmith” for her lockpicking and pickpocketing skills; Lilly, a delicate, sheltered young heiress whose work as a secretary for her eccentric uncle requires her to always wear gloves; and Mrs. Sucksby (Kristine Nielsen), a baby farmer who takes in unwanted babies from desperate women—for a price. Mrs. Sucksby and Richard “Gentleman” Rivers (Josiah Bania), a dashing con man, send Sue to work as a handmaiden for Maud to help scam her out of her inheritance. But unexpected passions, madness, and secrets come to light, complicating things a great deal.
Director Bill Rauch and the cast of “Fingersmith” serve up a captivating show, with a riveting, dexterously handled plot, thoughtful social commentary, and moments of emotional poignancy. This play is fully self-conscious, and the characters make occasional jabs at the Gothic genre’s sensationalism while in the heat of the moment. “I promised these folks a satisfying ending!” Sue cries in the middle of an intense scene, and she does not fail to deliver.
Based on the novel of the same name by Sarah Waters, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, Alexa Junge’s adaptation takes the audience on a whirlwind ride through an intricately laid plot that twists with every shift of the scene. And the scenes shift beautifully, accompanied by Andre Pluess’s sound design, featuring romantic and mysterious strains of English folk-inspired music. The compact set designed by Christopher Acebo can take the shape of a London slum, a mansion, an asylum, or a gallows with a few elegant lighting changes and rotations of the floor. Jen Schriever’s ingenious lighting design centers on a large sheet hanging at the center of the stage on which black-and-white film is projected when the plot thickens. The costumes, designed by Deborah Dryden, play an important role in the play’s plot, and range from practical brown frocks for the poor to sumptuous pastel gowns for the rich.
As a setting, Victorian England has a rich artistic history of works exploring women’s issues and the budding of feminist thought. “Fingersmith” duly defies “traditional portrayals of what was considered appropriately ‘feminine’ at the time,” as Junge writes in the program notes. Sue, Maud, and Mrs. Sucksby manipulate the enormous social constraints of being a woman in Victorian England, rich or poor, as they each try to secure money and freedom in their own way. They are each complex, with lovingly depicted internal lives, while “Gentleman” receives nothing near the intimate emotional portraiture that the women do. Although he initially seems to be the primary agent in the story, it is revealed in a later twist that he is only one of the pawns. The corset stands at the center of the play (and the promotional posters) as a familiar symbol of the beauty standards, restrictions, and sexualization of women in the era. It is featured in the intimate private chamber scenes when Sue undresses Maud. The removal of her painfully tight corset, her enormous taffeta gown, and finally her gloves which she must never, ever remove—all combine to depict the vast chasm between how the Victorian woman must present herself in public, and the complex, chaotic, sometimes violent inner life that may be lurking just beneath the surface.
What shines brightest in the show, though, is not so much the sweeping feminist symbolism, the lushly woven backdrop, or the gasp-inducing plot twists, but rather the quiet moments of heartbreaking realization that feature the stellar acting talents of Chimo and Lind. A single tone of a tuning fork rings through the theater at a particular moment when Sue and Maud each realize their mutual attraction, deliciously alone together in a private chamber. And when shocking revelations come to light the show takes a break from the raucous, whirling, nonstop action to peer gently and deeply into the two heroines’ hearts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 22, 2016 at 8:48 p.m. 
The National Labor Relations Board will hold hearings to determine the fate of Harvard’s student unionization effort after a vote count Thursday morning showed that the election—which currently indicates that more eligible students voted against forming a union than for it—remains too close to call.
According to NLRB deputy regional attorney Robert P. Redbord, 1,456 students voted “no” to forming a union, compared to 1,272 voting yes.
But Redbord said 314 ballots remain under challenge. Challenged ballots were set aside and not initially included in the count because of questions about the voters’ eligibility. Because these ballots could numerically swing the election, the final result could not be determined Thursday.
“The vote is so close that the number of challenges could determine the outcome of the election,” Redbord said.
Thousands of eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants voted in the historic Nov. 16 and 17 election—the first union election on a private university campus since the August NLRB decision recognized these students as workers under the law.
About  1,200 ballots were challenged during the election, delaying the vote count for several weeks. University officials and graduate student organizers have been sifting through those ballots one by one to determine eligibility, and had worked through about 900 thus far.
The NLRB will hold hearings to decide which challenged ballots should be counted, and in turn, whether eligible students at Harvard can form a union.
Per NLRB rules, the regional board’s hearing will begin in approximately 21 days.
In a post on the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers Facebook page, union organizers said they were disappointed with the the election’s inconclusive results.
“While this news is not what we were hoping for today, our work is not over,” the post reads, adding that organizers would persevere in their efforts to create a student union at Harvard despite the vote’s outcome.
But opponents of the unionization effort were heartened by Thursday’s vote count. Jae Hyeon Lee, a Ph.D. student who has been a vocal opponent of unionization and created the Facebook page “Against HGSU-UAW,” said he was surprised by the result.
“I was expecting the vote to go in favor of the union supporters,” Lee said. “It was a nice surprise to see that a majority of students voted against the union.”
Leading up to Thursday’s count, union organizers and Harvard officials had continuously disagreed about the eligibility of some student voters. In particular, the two parties argued about whether graduate students who are not currently teaching, but will teach in the future, could vote and about the eligibility of votes cast by students whose names on the ballots did not match their names on their IDs.
Redbord called the weeks-long delay before today’s count “quite unusual.” The NLRB has conducted larger elections, he said, but this delay was “a function of...the number of people that were challenged.”
Harvard was the first private university to hold a vote on student unionization since the NLRB’s decision, but the second to count ballots. Earlier this month, Columbia students decisively approved unionization by a vote of 1,602 to 623.
Harvard’s election had nearly double the number of challenged ballots as Columbia’s, and more students turned out to vote at Harvard. Including challenged ballots, 3,042 students voted in Harvard’s election, compared to 2,872 in Columbia’s.
After its election, Columbia filed objections to the vote, arguing that members of the union interfered with voters accessing polls, board agents conducted themselves improperly, and issues of voter eligibility as reasons to scrap the results and hold a new election.
In a statement, Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul Curran wrote that “this election underscores the importance of the University’s commitment to continuing to improve the experience of our students.”
If the hearings next month result in the formation of the union, an estimated 3,500 graduate and undergraduate students would be included in the bargaining unit—about 2,000 from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, 1,000 from other graduate schools, and 500 undergraduates.
