After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2015, at 11:57  a.m.
After occupying Massachusetts Hall overnight, 14 protesters demanding that Harvard divest its endowment from fossil fuels left the administrative building Friday morning at about 10 a.m.
Activist group Divest Harvard initiated its occupation of the building Thursday morning at about 10 a.m., when more than 30 of its members entered the building and trailed an administrator through a door that is typically locked. Protesters staged their sit-in in Mass. Hall’s first floor hallway, which contains the offices of University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Alan. M. Garber ’76, and other officials.
Faust, who has repeatedly argued that Harvard should not divest from fossil fuels, offered to meet with the protesters on Thursday, but on the condition that they exit Mass. Hall. The protesters rejected her offer.
In a statement Thursday, University spokesperson Jeff Neal called the protesters’ occupation “disrespectful and coercive interference.”
Still, Divest Harvard co-coordinator Talia K. Rothstein '17 said the group viewed the sit-in as a success even though they did not meet with Faust or convince her to divest Harvard’s $35.9 billion endowment.
“We saw incredible pressure pouring in on the administration; we brought the issue to the limelight again,” Rothstein said. “We’ve found that we really made our voices heard.”
Later in the day at 3 p.m., a group of Divest Harvard supporters rallied outside of Mass. Hall in support of Global Divestment Day, which activists planned to call for divestment from fossil fuels.
“We wanted to come together in an inspiring, uplifting mood,” Rothstein said after the rally.
The crowd sang African spiritual songs led by Rev. Fred Small, the senior minister at First Parish in Cambridge on Church Street, chanting, “Ain't gonna let Drew Faust turn me around.” Small said the parish, which divested its endowment from fossil fuels in 2013, is calling Harvard to do the same.
“My prayer is that [Faust] will come to understand the importance of divestment as a moral statement for a huge institution,” Smalls said. “Harvard could make a huge statement.”
Divest Harvard members also collected signatures for a week of civil disobedience they plan to stage in April, which will include prominent alumni and faculty, including author and activist Cornel R. West ’74, according to Rothstein. Rothstein said specific plans for the week are still in the works.
In a statement late Friday afternoon, Neal reiterated that “Harvard will continue to focus its efforts to combat climate change on the teaching, learning and research conducted by faculty and students who are committed to accelerating the transition to renewable sources of energy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 16, 2015, at 11:10 p.m. 
The College will house both the Administrative Board and a student-faculty Honor Council under a single office as administrators roll out the College’s first honor code next school year.
The Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, as it will be called, will replace the College’s Office of the Secretary of the Ad Board in July, according to an email sent to undergraduates Friday from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
Brett Flehinger, the Ad Board’s current interim secretary, and Lauren E. Brandt ’01, its interim associate secretary, will take on new leadership roles in the reorganized office, according to Khurana’s email. Flehinger will serve as Honor Council secretary while Brandt will become the Ad Board’s permanent secretary, and they will also hold the formal titles of associate dean of academic integrity and student conduct and assistant dean of academic integrity and student conduct, respectively.
In his email, Khurana wrote that the “new office will play a central role in driving our cultural commitment to integrity that forms the foundation of the new honor code,” a new policy that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved last year and that will overhaul the College’s approach to handling cheating cases next fall. The policy will remove most, if not all, cheating cases from the Ad Board’s jurisdiction with the creation of the new Honor Council, an adjudicatory body whose membership may include students, faculty, administrators, and teaching fellows.
Current Ad Board staff members Ann Weissman, Emily J. Miller, and Jane Collins will work in the reorganized office, according to Khurana’s email.
Although the College’s Academic Integrity Committee has played a leading role in crafting the honor code, committee member Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16 said the reorganization was largely the work of the Dean of the College’s Office.
Khurana, who chairs the Ad Board and was one of several people to draft the honor code, declined to comment on the new office Friday, deferring questions to Flehinger.
Jeffrey said housing the two judiciary bodies in one office will allow them to collaborate and exchange information.
“It'll be great that the two bodies are in the same office in the sense that a lot of what the Honor Council is doing is what the Ad Board has done for decades,” Jeffrey said. “The Honor Council will be able to benefit from all of the institutional knowledge that the Ad Board has.”
Brandt and Flehinger will speak about the development of the new office Wednesday at 4 p.m. in Leverett House’s Janulis Common Room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2015, at 12:20 p.m.
Some dining halls will stay open during spring break this year as part of a pilot program funded by the Dean of the College’s Office, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said Friday.
The program is modeled after the College’s limited meal plan over winter break, when certain Houses remain open for meals. The College will cover the costs of the expanded options by tightening the budget in other areas, including suspending per diems for athletes during spring break, according to Khurana and College Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba. In particular, Khurana credited Thimba with making the necessary budget modification plans.
The changes come after Undergraduate Council leaders lobbied for expanded spring break dining options. In spring 2013, the UC formally approved legislation requesting that the College provide such options to students during spring break and later met with Harvard University Dining Services to discuss the issue.
Khurana said his office will evaluate data from the pilot program when deciding whether to expand it.
On Friday, UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 praised the pilot program as an example of a student advocacy initiative’s success.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven sat in on The Crimson’s interview with Khurana and Thimba.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a tale of two halves for the Harvard men’s basketball team (16-5, 6-1 Ivy) Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. After jumping out to a 19-point lead, the hosts frittered away the advantage. After continuously cutting into the deficit, Columbia (11-10, 3-4) finally drew even on a Jeff Coby three with eight seconds to go.
Then it was Siyani Chambers’s time.
As the Lions bench erupted in cheers, the junior co-captain was already in motion. Gathering the ball, he flew down the court, shaking a defender with a crossover and canning a jumper with 2.9 seconds remaining to give the Crimson a two-point lead.
Timeout Columbia. Game in hand.
Although two late free throws from senior wing Wesley Saunders provided the final 72-68 margin, the shot by Chambers was—once again—the clincher. Afterwards, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker and senior forward Jonah Travis noted that at the end of the game, the team wants the ball in the hands of its floor general.
“He’s made plays like that all the time,” Saunders said. “That’s what he does. I trust him with the ball late in games sometimes more than myself.”
Friday was not the first time that the backcourt of Chambers and Saunders bailed out the Crimson. Chambers hit a buzzer-beater against Boston University his freshman year, following it up with several clutch shots down the stretch against New Mexico in the NCAA tournament. Saunders—who hit the clinching shot against UMass in November—had a layup to force overtime and avoid a loss last week against Brown.
The two were at their best Friday, combining for 34 points, nine assists, three steals, and just two turnovers. They made six of 10 threes, spacing the floor for co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and Travis (26 combined points) inside. With two starters—junior Agunwa Okolie and sophomore Zena Edosomwan—combining for just six points, the backcourt carried the offensive load all night.
“These are the two guys we want with the ball,” Travis said. “I don’t care if they are 0-for-20 for the entire game. We are getting them the ball when the clock runs down and [setting] them up for a great play. More often than not, they make the right plays, and we get the result we did tonight.”
The backcourt was the catalyst in the first half, as Harvard ran out to a 17-point halftime advantage. Flying around the floor, the Crimson had 48 points in 20 minutes after managing just 52 in the entire game in its last outing—a road victory over Yale. Saunders hit all three of his three-point attempts as Harvard rained down seven threes—equaling its total from last weekend’s pair of games in a single half.
The Lions bounced off the mat quickly in the second half, beginning the period on a 14-1 run reminiscent of the 26-2 streak Dartmouth used to take down the Crimson three weeks prior.
“We felt good about the first half,” Saunders said. “Second half, four minutes in, it just felt like we’d been here before. You could feel the energy swinging in their direction.”
But with the game in the balance, Harvard’s seniors stepped up. Saunders had assists on consecutive positions before picking the pocket of star Columbia guard Maodo Lo on the next. Travis had two free throws to push the lead back to eight, giving the Crimson ample breathing room.
The Lions kept coming behind the play of Lo. Playing an inverted offense, Columbia posted Chambers on each possession it could, using the larger Issac Cohen to run the offense from the paint. Clutch threes from the Lions (who shot 50 percent from deep on the game) kept any lead from ballooning, and after Harvard went on an 8-4 run to go up six with three minutes to go, Columbia locked down.
For the next 3:30, the Lions held the Crimson scoreless, routinely forcing Harvard into late shot clock heaves. After a Lo three-pointer cut the deficit to three with under a minute to go, Chambers almost missed the rim entirely on his next attempt.
However, the point guard would redeem himself a possession later. Finishing with 16 points, three assists, and no turnovers, the junior lived up to the moniker Amaker has always bestowed upon him—the team’s most important player.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the postponement of Monday’s Beanpot consolation game may have been a nuisance for fans of the No. 14/13 Harvard men’s ice hockey team, it was a blessing in disguise for the Crimson.
After playing over 200 minutes of hockey the previous week, Harvard (13-8-2, 9-6-2 ECAC) came out rested and energized in its first appearance of February at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The Crimson’s two first-period goals set the tone for the night, as Harvard never looked back en route to a 4-1 victory over Colgate (15-11-3, 7-7-3), snapping a four-game losing skid in the process.
While sophomore forward Sean Malone did not play in the teams’ first matchup back in January, he made sure his presence was felt on Friday night.
Junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo flicked a pass to the Buffalo Sabres prospect, and Malone took over from there. The second-year star sent a pass off the right boards for himself, collected it, and drove to the net before passing it over to classmate Luke Esposito, who finished with a backhand to give the Crimson a two-goal cushion.
“It’s the first time I’ve played with Esposito and Moy [on the second line],” Malone said. “We’re all three centers, [so] it’s an interesting mix. [But] I think we showed up tonight.”
The goal from Esposito came on his first shot in nearly a month after the sophomore sat out his last five games due to injury, including the team's commanding 6-1 victory over the Raiders on Jan. 24.
“We had a lot of chances to score some prettier goals,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We made some nice plays. Looing at the goals that we did score, we shot the puck and drove the net.”
Sophomore forward Tyler Moy added some insurance for the Crimson with one second remaining in the second period. Junior forward Jimmy Vesey held the puck just to the right of the crease before sending it over to a streaking Moy, who went to one knee and batted it home to put his side up three goals.
Colgate had a chance to strike early in the game when freshman Seb Lloyd was called for holding at the 2:53 mark in the first. But the Raiders surrendered three shots while generating only one of their own before Colgate defenseman Kevin Lough was called for holding with 39 seconds remaining on the advantage.
Instead, Malone opened the scoring. After his first shot missed left, the sophomore received a favorable bounce off the back boards and finished top shelf over the shoulder of Raider goaltender Zac Hamilton at the 8:38 mark in the first. Since returning to the ice on Feb. 3, Malone has scored or assisted on half of Harvard’s goals.
The Crimson had had trouble generating power plays during its four-game losing streak, averaging less than three attempts per game.  Nonetheless, Harvard forced three Colgate penalties in the first period alone and five overall, even though the team was unable to turn those chances into goals.
“I think we had to really penetrate the tougher areas of the ice around the net,” Donato sad. “We didn’t score on the power play tonight, but the third goal was essentially a power play goal.”
Sophomore forward Phil Zielonka added a goal midway through the third. The second-year player cut from right to left across the slot, getting Hamilton to move to his right before nipping twine over the first-year goalie’s left shoulder.
The Raiders had no problems generating man-advantage opportunities, either. But the Crimson penalty kill stopped four of the five chances that their special teams unit had. Colgate sophomore Tim Harrison was able to net a goal with 14 minutes left in the third, but it was too little, too late for the Raiders.
While Harvard was able to end a losing skid with the win, Colgate’s troubles continued. The Raiders have only won one of their past seven games, with that victory coming against ECAC cellar-dweller Princeton. After being ranked for all of 2015, Colgate fell out of the national U.S. College Hockey Online rankings for the first time this past week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For about two years now, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker has called point guard Siyani Chambers “the most important player” on the Crimson roster—with 2.9 seconds left in Friday night’s game, the junior co-captain earned that moniker.
Chambers had just missed the front end of a one-and-one and, on the previous Harvard possession, had taken an ill-fated, step-back three pointer that ricocheted off the backboard and into Columbia’s waiting hands. With the game clock ticking towards 10 seconds and the Lions down three, Columbia’s standout point guard Maodo Lo penetrated into the paint and kicked it out to forward Jeff Coby, who drilled the open trey, tying the game at 68.
Amaker didn’t call for a timeout, and Chambers brought the ball up the floor, just eight seconds remaining. The junior hesitated at the right wing before taking two hard dribbles inside the perimeter, sending Lo flying as he let the shot go. The ball splashed through the hoop as Chambers fell backwards, marking the final bucket of the best shooting night he’s seen since the season opener against MIT on Nov. 14.
With that hoop and Columbia’s (11-10, 3-4 Ivy) ensuing turnover, the Crimson (16-5, 6-1) clinched its fifth straight Ivy win, defeating the Lions, 72-68, Friday evening at Lavietes Pavilion.
“Luckily, we had some time on the clock, and we go over situations [like these] all the time in practice—we just try to get the ball out quick, get it up, and try to get a good look,” Chambers explained. “[L]uckily enough, I was able to get down to the wing and make a shot.”
For the game, Chambers shot 6-of-11 from the floor, knocking down three of the five treys he attempted. It was the first time since a January 2014 loss to the eventual-national champion Connecticut that the point guard made six field goals, while his 16 points tied his season high.
“He made a great decision [at the end],” Amaker said. “I thought it took a great amount of guts from his part after the way he missed the previous shot…. [W]e’re very proud of him—he did exactly what our philosophy [dictates] and how we want to play that type of situation.”
The contest was a matchup of two of the league’s premier floor generals, a head-to-head that saw Lo—Columbia’s leader in steals, who, at 6’3”, has also climbed to third on the team in blocks—guard Chambers for much of the game. Despite the defensive pressure, the latter didn’t commit a single turnover on the night—the first time he’s been spotless since that November game against MIT.
LIGHTS OUT
If Harvard’s offensive performance in the first half of its game against Yale last Saturday could be described as a drought, the opening 20 minutes against Columbia might be best called an onslaught.
After only scoring 16 points prior to intermission against the Bulldogs, the Crimson scored 18 in just over six minutes of play on Friday, soon tripling last Saturday’s first-half performance with 48 points by the end of the first period.
The 180-degree offensive turnaround could be attributed to the hot shooting of nearly every Harvard player that stepped onto the hardwood, as the team shot a cool 63.6 percent from deep in those opening minutes. Led by senior wing Wesley Saunders, who notched 16 points, three rebounds, and three assists on 5-of-8 shooting in the first half alone, the Crimson leaned on its perimeter play early and often.
After the Lions made the first hoop of the game, Harvard went on an 18-3 tear, holding the visiting squad to just one basket in five minutes, beginning at the 18:29 mark. The run was punctuated by consecutive threes from Chambers and Saunders, each one assisted by the other, before Saunders grabbed a Lion rebound and went coast-to-coast, skipping into the lane and drawing the foul to bring the score to 15-6. A second Chambers trey two possessions later capped off the spurt at 18-6, and the Crimson was able to coast for the rest of the half.
Accompanying the offensive performance was an active defensive effort for Harvard, which nabbed four steals before the break.
“I was really, really pleased and proud of our guys for being ready to go tonight,” Amaker explained. “You saw the energy and effort that they were playing with on the defensive end in the first 20 minutes and how that led to so much positive stuff offensively.”
When Columbia made a run of its own at the close of the contest—necessitating that Chambers right-wing jumper with just ticks remaining in the game—this early offensive cushion enabled the Lions’ storm to be weathered, with just a few anxious moments for the Crimson bench, and not the win, expended in the process.
LO-BALL
With Harvard’s best defender in Saunders on him for much of the game, Maodo Lo showed off everything in his repertoire in the hope of overturning the odds and earning his team the upset at Lavietes.
The junior had a game-high 22 points, pacing his squad in rebounds (six) and tying for a team high in dimes (four).
With the bigger Saunders in his face, Lo put up six points and two assists in the 5:52 before the first media timeout of the second period, slicing into the Crimson’s double-digit advantage as he alone doubled Harvard’s scoring output in that span.
And, with just 55 seconds remaining, it was Lo that knocked down a set-play three-pointer to bring his team within three—and, on Columbia’s next possession, it was Lo that dribbled baseline, finding Coby up top for the game-tying triple.
“He’s arguably as good as anybody in our conference,” Amaker said. “He has the total package as an offensive player, and is a very, very difficult kid to guard.”
“They cut right into it and made it a ballgame, and that’s to their credit,” Amaker added. “I just thought that as the game got tight…our guys [were] pretty tough…. We have confidence in them, and I think that’s as big as anything.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A late jumper by junior co-captain Siyani Chambers catapulted the Harvard men’s basketball team (16-5, 6-1 Ivy) to its fifth straight win Friday. The Crimson goes for its 20th win in its last 22 games at home Saturday against the Cornell Big Red. Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard looks to complete its first home sweep of the year.
Balance, Balance, Balance: Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s favorite phrase, his team’s “bench and balance,” came up big for the Crimson against Columbia. Senior Jonah Travis had 12 points off of the bench, playing most of the second half and hitting a dagger jumper late in the game. Amaker has moved to a seven-man rotation almost exclusively since the beginning of conference play, sticking nonconference rotation players like freshman Andre Chatfield and junior Evan Cummins on the bench for the entire 40 minutes, making Travis’ efforts even more important.
On the other side of the floor, Cornell is a top-heavy squad led by sophomore guard Robert Hatter and senior forward Shonn Miller. The Big Red had four players in double figures in an overtime victory Friday over Dartmouth and has been at its best this season when role players like Devin Cherry and Galal Cancer can step up. Cancer had 17 points in Cornell’s best win of the season, a 68-60 triumph last Saturday over Princeton; to beat Harvard, Cornell will need him and Cherry to stretch the Crimson defense out to the three-point line.
Captain Clutch: For the season, Chambers has struggled horribly, making just 34 percent of his shots and 33 percent of his threes. He is averaging the fewest points, assists, and rebounds of his career, with foul and turnover averages worse than last year. It mattered little Friday night. Chambers watched from the other side of the court as Columbia point guard Maodo Lo tore up teammates with a vicious series of crossover and in-and-out dribbles to the tune of 22 points over 39 minutes. It was Lo who found forward Jeff Coby for the game-tying three-pointer with eight seconds to go, but Chambers who had the last laugh—draining a jumper in his defender’s grill to seal the ballgame.
With the exception of Penn, each of Harvard’s last five Ivy League games has been decided by four points or less. If it comes down to that again Saturday, look for the point guard with nerves of steel to have the ball in his hands again.
Elimination Games: Columbia’s loss to the Crimson Friday night effectively eliminated the Lions from the conference title race at three games back with seven to go. Two teams face similar predicaments Saturday night. A Cornell loss would put both of the Gentleman’s C’s out of contention, while Princeton hosts Yale looking to keep its title hopes alive. If the Tigers cannot win at Jadwin, with trips to Payne Whitney and Lavietes on the horizon, they can kiss the crown goodbye. Ditto for Cornell, which has yet to host the Crimson or visit Jadwin and Payne Whitney.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a poor offensive performance in the first half, the Harvard men’s basketball team (17-5, 7-1 Ivy) won handily against Cornell (12-12, 4-4) thanks to a big run to open up the second half.
MAKING IT RAIN
After draining seven threes in the first half of Friday night’s win over Columbia, the Crimson went 0-for-8 from beyond the arc in the first half against Cornell. Senior Wesley Saunders was personally responsible for half of those misses, as he finished the first half without a single point.
In what would turn into a 31-minute drought dating back to last nights contest, Harvard simply couldn’t buy a basket from deep for the beginning of Saturday’s matchup.
“I think a lot of us took good shots,” sophomore guard Corbin Miller said. “I remember one in the corner that was wide open, it just didn’t go down.”
That was the storyline for Harvard in the open half; the Crimson’s offensive woes, especially from three, were not a product of poor possessions or stagnant players, but rather an inability to simply connect on shots.
Nonetheless, Harvard stayed the course. After missing his fifth three point attempt of the game to open the second half, Saunders promptly knocked down the Crimson’s first three of the game just two possessions later.
From there, it was as if the basket seemed to get wider and wider for the home team. In the second half, Harvard went 7-of-13 from three including two from both Miller and junior captain Siyani Chamber.
“Being here at home, our focus coming out was just to continue to play tough defense, attack on offense, and trust that shots were going to fall,” Miller said.
HOLDING DOWN THE FORT
While Harvard’s offense may have come alive in the second half, that was by no means the case on the defensive end. Instead, the Crimson’s stifling defense was omnipresent throughout the entire contest.
Harvard set the tone from the opening possession. After Cornell won the tip off, junior Agunwa Okolie raced back and sent a lay up from Cornell senior Galal Cancer flying into the stands.
“The key to this game for us was our defense,” Head Coach Tommy Amaker noted. “When you see the numbers and it kind of shows you that our defensive pressure and ability to get the ball off the backboard allows us to play up the floor.”
While Harvard’s offense struggled in the first half, its defense limited Cornell, a team that averages 32.5 points per a half, to only 24 points in the first half.
“We kept our defensive intensity up,” Amaker said. “I thought that was the key for us at the half.
In the second half, it was more of the same. A combination of solid interior play by Okolie, Saunders, sophomore Zena Edosomwan combined with a collective defensive rebounding effort forced Cornell to settle for low percentage shots. Saunders alone was responsible for 10 defensive rebounds, as he fell just short of his career high of 12.
DON'T BLINKAs the clocked expired in the first half, junior captain Siyani Chambers broke down his defender to hit the layup and send the Crimson into the locker room trailing 24-21.
Previously, Harvard’s offense had struggled. No fast break points, five turnovers, and 31 percent shooting from the floor character a forgetful first half for the Crimson on offense.
Nonetheless, things changed ever so quickly for the home team. Saunders opened up the second half with five straight points, hitting a tough bank shot from the left side and then draining a three on the next possession.
“I just wanted to come out and give the team an energy boost and lead the way,” Saunders said. “That was a good start and my teammates just found me, they had confidence in me to keep giving me the ball.”
In just 1:12, Cornell had lost its lead that it had worked the entire first half to build. But things would only get worse from there for the Big Red.
Over the next eight minutes, Harvard would go on a 24-2 run, extending the lead and making it a 45-26 game. In what seemed like the blink of an eye, the Crimson had taken what looked like a potential upset and turned it into a blowout.
During that run, Chamber’s ability to push the pace and find both Miller and Saunders in transition was crucial in breaking down the Cornell defense.

For Big Red associate head coach Ben Syer, it was a “resilient” effort. For Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, it was a “frustrating” affair.
In the end, Saturday evening’s tie at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center felt like another Ivy League rivalry game of years past. The odds and stakes may have been higher at the Yale Bowl in November 1968, but on Valentine’s Day 2015, the Cornell men’s ice hockey team beat the Crimson, 3-3.
Third-line sophomore Jeff Kubiak and fourth-line freshman Jared Fiegl scored their first goals of the season to erase two Harvard leads in the final frame of regulation. Led by a goal and two assists from junior left wing Jimmy Vesey, the Crimson first line scored three times, but No. 14/13 Harvard (13-8-3, 9-6-3 ECAC) left the ice unsatisfied with the draw.
“We’re disappointed and frustrated,” Donato said. “We should have protected [our leads].... We didn’t pick up sticks going back, and we need to find a way to get two points.”
Moments after Vesey scored his 19th goal of the season to give the Crimson a 3-2 lead with 5:02 left in regulation, the Big Red (10-11-4, 8-8-2) found an answer from an unlikely source. Fiegl put back a rebound in the slot from junior linemate Teemu Tiitinen to catch Harvard junior goaltender Steve Michalek (26 saves) out of position.
Both sides had opportunities to win in overtime, including a shot in the high slot by Crimson junior defenseman Desmond Bergin that had Cornell sophomore goaltender Mitch Gillam, who had 35 saves on the night, looking behind himself.
Overall, the win-tie weekend was a positive development for Donato’s team, which entered the weekend on a four-game losing streak. Yet Donato was disappointed with Saturday’s result, which came after a quiet night of officiating and 65 minutes that Harvard largely controlled.
“I think we carried the play for good stretches of the game,” Donato said. “I’m a little bit frustrated in the sense that it turned into a wrestling match more than a hockey game. To find [only] one penalty in the game would be shocking to me.”
To Donato’s surprise, the Crimson did not receive a power play the entire evening despite a physical, clutch-and-grab-style game. Simultaneous Harvard penalties cancelled out each of the Big Red’s two infractions.
“By putting your whistle away, you are impacting the game,” Donato said. “I think that unfortunately the refs just decided to let the game be played.”
The game's lone power play resulted in Cornell's first goal, a left-point strike from top senior center Cole Bardreau in the second period. Bardreau’s goal came with 23 seconds left in a major penalty to Vesey, who had received five minutes for boarding after a high hit on sophomore defenseman Holden Anderson.
With the Big Red up a goal, the hosts’ top line took over. Vesey connected with Kerfoot in the slot to tie the game at 8:17 in the period. Less than three minutes later, junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo stuffed the puck past Gillam’s right pad to take a 2-1 lead.
“Now that [Kerfoot] is back [on the first line], it’s just a matter of them getting their chemistry back, which I definitely think they are starting to get," said sophomore defenseman Victor Newell, who picked up secondary assists on each of Harvard's second period goals. "[That is] scary for a lot of teams.”
Kerfoot and junior forward Brian Hart missed opportunities to extend the Crimson’s advantage in the middle frame, but Harvard entered the intermission outshooting Cornell, 28-18.
In the third, Kubiak drew the game even at two, beating Michalek from the high slot off a behind-the-goal feed from freshman linemate Dwyer Tschantz. Vesey appeared to put the final punctuation on a back-and-forth third period before Fiegl punched in his first collegiate goal.
Cornell remains a game-and-a-half behind Harvard in an eight-team race for a top-four conference finish and first-round bye in the ECAC Tournament. With four games remaining in the conference regular season, Donato’s goal for the Crimson is the same that it was at the beginning of the season: steady improvement.
“The effort was there,” Donato said. “I think overall this weekend, we made a step forward and there were some positive things. But as we talked about earlier in the season, we have to continue to improve.”

With Valentine’s Day fast-approaching, there’s a buzz of students around campus trying to find a date. While Flyby’s already given you the how-to on picking your special someone (see: earning potential), here’s a list of places to consider to take your crush on campus once you fall in love. These are certain to create lasting memories.
The QuadIf you’re already in a long-distance relationship (it’s over a mile from the Quad to some River Houses), you know the struggle. But the Quad offers some great appeal for Valentine’s Day. Quad Grill’s mozzarella sticks just scream love. Plus, residents of the River hardly visit the Quad (still wondering where a few of my freshman year friends have been all year…) so it won’t even seem like you’re still on campus!
Lamont CaféSushi is a natural aphrodisiac, and Lamont Café sushi is most certainly natural. Too bad Widener doesn’t have sushi. The stacks are RIGHT THERE.
Your House LibraryProblem sets + readings + complete silence = perfection.
Fly-By (FYI: the quick lunch place, not us) and Queen’s Head PubWith your busy schedule, you only really have 15 minutes to devote to your date. And you both have to eat, right? Kill two birds with one stone.
AnnenbergBecause you actually don’t have a date and want to wallow in your sorrow with a huge bowl of Cracklin’ Oat Bran.

If you’ve been on Facebook at all in the past 24 hours (which, based on procrastination habits, you probably have), then you might have seen BuzzFeed’s latest listicle: “22 Things Only People Who Went to Harvard Will Understand.
Based on the Facebook comments, people were pretty confused about some of the article’s mix-ups. Was it really bad satire, or just a really bad article? Why are some of the things so oddly specific? When did the Dunster Inn get stained glass?
“[A]ll the names of the dorms and dining halls are wrong here, i’m just trying to troll some nerd into correcting me),” the author claimed on her Twitter (Notopoulos 2015).
(Yes, that’s an APA citation. Because I am a nerd.)
We at Flyby were so inspired, that in the spirit of BuzzFeed’s cutting edge journalism, we came up with this list of things that only writers for BuzzFeed would understand.
