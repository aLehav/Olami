After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a final stop before the first round of the Beanpot Monday, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team (12-4-2, 8-3-2 ECAC) will host defending NCAA champion Union (12-10-2, 4-7-1) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. With junior defenseman Patrick McNally out indefinitely, the Crimson will turn to other skaters to step up. The Dutchmen will look to build off an 8-3 win over rival Rensselaer last weekend in an inconsistent year.
ON RESERVE
Harvard currently has more questions than answers when it comes to the team’s lineup.
In addition to McNally, the Crimson entered Saturday’s game at Colgate with seven other players unable to play because of injury: sophomore forwards Alex Kerfoot, Sean Malone, and Luke Esposito; junior forward Colin Blackwell; sophomore defenseman Kevin Guiltinan; and senior forward Ryan McGregor.
There is a chance that Kerfoot will return tonight against Union, and Donato is hopeful that Malone will be back soon as well. Harvard has not played a single game this season with both star sophomore centers in the lineup at the same time.
Meanwhile, the Crimson’s backline will have to step up in the absence of McNally, who is second among NCAA Division I blue liners in points per game (1.07). Sophomore defenseman Victor Newell, who struggled with injuries earlier in the season, had three assists last weekend and could be an important part of the Harvard attack going forward.
CHAMPIONSHIP HANGOVER
After capturing its first national championship in 2014, Union has had a rocky start to the 2014-2015 season. The Dutchmen have struggled in conference contests and are currently 10th in the ECAC.
Coach Rick Bennett’s squad lost Frozen Four MVP Shayne Gostisbehere to the pros after the team’s 7-4 win over No. 1 seed Minnesota in Philadelphia last April, yet the Dutchmen still have a number of key players from their national championship run, including junior goaltender Colin Stevens and sophomore forwards Eli Lichtenwald and Eli Pontarelli.
As The Daily Gazette’s Ken Schott reports, however, Lichtenwald and Pontarelli are battling sophomore slumps.  Lichtenwald is averaging 0.33 points per game this year, down from 0.68 the year prior, while Pontarelli’s production has similarly fallen from 0.59 to 0.24 points per game.
LAST TIME OUT
On Nov. 8, an unranked Harvard team tied then-No. 8 Union, 2-2, in Schenectady, N.Y.
The Crimson raced out to a two-goal lead by 10:44 in the first period with strikes from junior forwards Jimmy Vesey and Brian Hart. But the hosts outshot Harvard in the final two frames of regulation and tied the game with an extra attacker at 19:14 in the third period with a goal from freshman forward Spencer Foo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a quarter century of being a house of horrors, Jadwin Gymnasium has become a home away from home for the Harvard men’s basketball team (12-5, 2-1 Ivy).
A year after snapping a 24-game losing streak in Princeton, the Crimson notched back-to-back wins in Jadwin for the first time since 1984-1985 with a 75-72 victory over the host Tigers (8-10, 1-1) on Friday night. Sophomore Corbin Miller set career highs with five threes and 19 points—17 in the first 20 minutes—to pace the Crimson in both categories.
“Playing here on the road in our conference is obviously challenging, and this has been a really tough place for us to play through the years, so I’m proud of our team,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “For our kids to bounce back here tonight on the road shows an incredible amount of toughness.”
After blowing a 14-point lead against Dartmouth in its Ivy League home opener, the Crimson trailed for less than a minute in Friday’s contest. Yet the game wasn’t a foregone conclusion by any means. Shaky free-throw shooting down the stretch—at one point, Harvard missed five of seven shots at the line—gave Princeton chance after chance to get back into the game.
When it was tight, however, senior wing Wesley Saunders bailed out Harvard once again. Despite missing four straight free throws, Saunders had two crucial steals down the stretch to snuff out Tiger rallies, and knocked down two final free throws to seal the game.
For the contest, Saunders stuffed the stat sheet with 14 points, eight assists, seven rebounds, and four steals despite foul trouble that disrupted his offensive rhythm. The senior had five assists in the first half, routinely beating an array of Princeton defenders into the lane and looking not for his own shot, but for teammates.
Fellow senior Jonah Travis was the recipient of numerous Saunders passes, at one point converting three-point plays on consecutive dishes from the wing.
“We are a whole different team when he is able to get in the middle and disrupt things, whether that is being able to knock down his layups or dish it out on the block when me or Steve or Zena or Evan are asking for it,” Travis said. “He just commands so much attention that a lot of us end up benefiting because of it.”
Travis and Miller came off the bench to combine for 33 points in 55 minutes—providing the spark that Harvard needed with Saunders and sophomore Zena Edosomwan (zero points, three fouls) unable to stay in the game. Shortening the bench, Amaker did not play reserve big men freshman Chris Egi or junior Evan Cummins at all; down the stretch, the Crimson often played a four-guard lineup with junior Agunwa Okolie at power forward and the 6’6” Travis as the nominal center on the floor.
“I become more of a guy that has to hold down the paint [in that lineup],” Travis said. “Steve is an excellent shot blocker and does very well helping on the weak side, so I have to take on that responsibility [when he’s not in the game] because [Okolie] is more on the ball.”
The story of the first half, however, was Corbin Miller. The sophomore hit all five of his triples by halftime, raining fire from every part of the three-point line. He beat Princeton defenders in multiple ways—spotting up, going off the dribble, and even fading away. With Laurent Rivard ’14—the most decorated three-point shooter in Harvard history—in the stands, Miller hit six of seven first-half shots to help the Crimson hold a 10-point lead at the half.
Princeton did not go away, however, running off six consecutive points to start the second period. Tiger coach Mitch Henderson, who afterwards admitted to being worried about defending Miller before the game, readjusted to contain the sophomore.
As students rained down taunts of “Klay”—a reference to the NBA sharpshooter who had 37 points in a quarter a week ago—Princeton held Miller without a second-half field goal.
On the other end, Stephen Cook poured in 11 of his game-high 21 to keep the Tigers in it all night. Cook added four assists, doing it both behind the arc (3-for-5 three-point shooting) and in the lane. At one point, he blocked Okolie at the rim before coming down for a three-point play on the other end to bring the building to its feet and cut the lead to 49-47.
As it did all night, Harvard flinched but didn’t back down. The Crimson scored five straight to push the lead to seven and led by at least four until an Amir Bell three-pointer with 0.4 seconds to go provided the final margin.
“Basketball is a game of runs,” Miller said. “We know teams are going to make their runs but it’s up to us to tighten up and maintain our lead down the stretch and combat the runs that other teams will make.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a first half that featured a bevy of jump shots from beyond the arc, it was the other kind of three-point play that made the difference down the stretch for the Harvard men’s basketball team en route to its 75-72 victory over Princeton on Friday evening at Jadwin Gymnasium.
While the Crimson (12-5, 2-1 Ivy) held a double-digit lead at intermission, a layup, a floater, and a baby jumper from the Tigers in the first 82 seconds of the second period quickly brought Princeton (8-10, 1-1) back into the game. As the clock ticked towards the 16-minute mark, the Tigers kept slicing into both the paint and Harvard’s advantage, coming within three, 43-40, with 16:38 to play.
But on the next possession, Harvard turned to the senior that coach Tommy Amaker often labels the team’s “spark plug”—Jonah Travis. Travis caught an entry pass from classmate Wesley Saunders on the right block, put his head down, drew contact, and flipped in the layup. And one.
Forty-five seconds later, the Crimson ran the same set: Saunders threaded a pass down to Travis, who was waiting on the right block this time. With the Tigers’ interior defense out of position, Travis made them pay once more, converting his second three-point play in as many possessions.
What was a three-point game was stretched back to seven, and—after another and-one courtesy of Saunders and another pair of layups from Travis—Harvard managed to hold off a series of Tiger comeback attempts, ultimately earning its second straight win at Jadwin.
TARGET PRACTICE
While the story of the second half might’ve been the Crimson’s post play, the storyline of the first period was undoubtedly what happened whenever sophomore guard Corbin Miller caught the ball on the perimeter.
Miller set a career high in three-pointers made—five—prior to the halftime buzzer, drilling as many treys in that period of time as Harvard did as a team in its outing against Dartmouth last weekend.
The sophomore effectively replicated his warm-up routine in those opening minutes, hitting a triple from each corner, each wing, and the top of the key.
“The shots felt really good,” Miller said. “I saw the first one go down, and the rest of them felt really good.”
In just the six minutes prior to intermission, Miller scored consecutive baskets on two different occasions, punishing the Tigers for their mid-game switch to a one-three-one zone defense.
At the 5:49 mark, Saunders dribbled down the baseline, finding the marksman for the three in the left corner. Forty-six seconds later, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers connected with Miller, this time in the right corner.
A step-back deep two and a straightaway three in the following minutes led Miller to tie his career high, 17 points, less than halfway into the game.
“[Miller] makes a big difference, no question about it,” Amaker said. “Corbin is a weapon…and you could see how streaky he can be and how confident he plays when he hits a few shots. He can shoot off the catch, he can shoot off the bounce. It’s a big difference for our team when he’s making shots.”
UTILITYMAN
Like it had all game—and like it has all season—the Crimson relied on reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Saunders when it counted most on Friday night.
A series of missed Harvard free throws and a timely Princeton triple had kept the home team in the game, and a costly Crimson turnover with just eight ticks remaining in the contest gave the Tigers the ball under their own basket, down just four points.
Princeton inbounded the rock to forward Steven Cook on the right wing. While play seemingly stood still as Cook held the ball in front of him, deciding on his next move, Saunders’s hands never stopped moving. The senior swiped the ball out of Cook’s grasp, ending Princeton’s possession and, effectively, the game.
The last-second defensive effort marked just one of Saunders’s three steals on the night to go along with his 14 points, seven rebounds, and game-high eight assists.
“Wesley does a lot for us,” Amaker said. “[I]t’s not so much the points he scores, it’s the points he’s responsible for. He’s responsible for a lot for our team, and I thought his playmaking ability throughout the game was key for us. There’s no question he made some dynamic plays, and Jonah, Corbin, and others were the beneficiaries of his decision-making and his playmaking skills.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard and Union men’s hockey teams squared off in early November, the 2,057 fans on hand at Messa Rink saw a battle between a team searching for its identity and a top-10 team learning to play without its top defenseman.
And when the two sides faced off for the second time Friday night, the plot line remained the same. Only this time, the roles of the teams had been reversed.
In the first meeting, the unranked Crimson earned a draw against the defending national champion and then-No. 8/8 Dutchmen, a team that had opened conference play with three straight losses in its first season since the departure of star defenseman and current Philadelphia Flyer Shayne Gostisbehere.
Two months later, with No. 4/4 Harvard facing a similar hole on the defensive end, unranked Union (13-10-2, 5-7-1 ECAC) scored early and often en route to a 5-4 victory over the Crimson (12-5-2, 8-4-2) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center Friday night.
“We just allowed them [to score] goals too easily,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They didn’t really have to have a lot of sustained pressure to get their goals. They got mindless turnovers by us, especially in that second period. Just not good enough…from top to bottom."
One day after learning that junior defenseman Patrick McNally would be out for at least the remainder of the regular season with a right leg injury, the Crimson had no answer for one of the most explosive top lines in all of college hockey.
Paced by two goals and two assists from the top goal scorer in the country, Daniel Ciampini, the Dutchmen’ first line was responsible for nine points on the night. Junior forward Matt Wilkins had a goal and two assists, and Saugus, Mass., native Mike Vecchione picked up two points as well.
Harvard’s first line also had a night to remember. Junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo and sophomore center Tyler Moy each had two points, and with a goal and two assists, junior forward Jimmy Vesey extended his point streak to match the number on his back, bringing it to 19 games.
Vesey found the back of the net just minutes after Wilkins gave Union a 3-2 lead. Criscuolo delivered a pass to his linemate alone at the blue line. One stride ahead of the nearest Dutchman, Vesey made his approach up the left side of the ice before moving to his backhand, and lifting one with ease over Union netminder Alex Sakellaropoulos.
“Whenever you can, get [number] 19 the puck,” co-captain Max Everson said. “It’s really incredible, super fun to watch, [and] it’s hard to put into words because [Vesey’s] absolutely lighting up everyone we play. He’s just got that knack for scoring goals.”
But in accordance with the trend of the night, the Dutchmen were quick to respond. Less than three minutes after Vesey’s equalizer, Ciampini proved he was not to be outdone, redirecting a shot from the blue line past Crimson goaltender Steve Michalek for his 22nd of the year.
Prior to the goal, no lead had lasted more than two and a half minutes. But the Dutchmen would maintain their latest one to the end, capping their victory with a goal from Vecchione. Chasing a bouncing puck down the right wing, the sophomore got behind the puck and ripped a slapshot into the top left corner of the net to seal the deal with 7:50 to go.
Harvard got one back with 51 seconds remaining courtesy of a one-timer from sophomore defenseman Victor Newell. But unlike Union, who came up with a last-minute equalizer in the teams’ first meeting, the Crimson could not push a fifth past the Dutchman in goal.
“[Union] played well,” Donato said. “They made plays and scored goals at key times, and our guys battled to the end, but I think it was not a very intelligent effort by us.”
The Dutchmen set the tone right out of the gate, as Ciampini poked a shot past Michalek just 21 seconds after the opening draw. But after a Vesey shot on the doorstep missed wide two minutes later, Criscuolo corralled the puck and jammed it home to level the score.
Harvard’s only lead of the game, the product of an early second period goal from rookie wing Jake Horton, lasted just 1:13, as Union went on to score four of the game’s next five goals.
In addition to McNally and junior defenseman Brayden Jaw, the Crimson again was without the services of sophomore forwards Alex Kerfoot, Sean Malone, and Luke Esposito, among others. Following the game, Donato said their status moving forward remains unclear.
“We’re missing some guys that we’d really like to have in the lineup, some big-time playmakers, but there’s no excuses going around,” Everson said. “There’s no one trying to deflect the blame of the loss. We just got to come out and play a better game for 60 minutes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the fourth time this year, the Harvard men’s basketball team (12-5, 2-1 Ivy) followed a loss with a win. Friday’s 75-72 triumph over Princeton may have been the Crimson’s biggest win since defeating UMass in November, and it left Harvard tied for second in the Ivy League heading into Saturday’s game against Penn (6-10 1-1). Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard goes to the Palestra. 
Guns Blazing
One of Friday’s most effective performances came from one of the Crimson’s most unlikely sources. Junior guard Agunwa Okolie put up a career-high eight shot attempts and a season-high 10 points. Okolie thrived as the four in ultra-small lineups, making harder cuts to the basket and finishing at the rim.
Other than getting denied by Stephen Cook at the rim on a dunk attempt (think Roy Hibbert’s 2012 rejection of Carmelo Anthony), Okolie looked as good as he had all season. The junior is not a floor spacer and does not have space to drive in two-big lineups, making him an awkward fit with Amaker’s preferred starting lineup. But the Ajax, Ontario native is a rangy defender who blanketed Princeton’s leading scorer, sophomore Spencer Weisz, into zero points Friday. He will be an X-factor for the Crimson moving forward if he can consistently produce on the offensive end.
Ivy Road Madness
Through 11 Ivy League contests, the road team is a sparkling 7-4. The two top teams in the conference, Harvard and Yale, have won all four of their contests away from home and eked out similarly close wins Friday on the road. After stretching its three-point halftime lead to nine early in the second period, Yale held its breath until the final buzzer of a 63-59 win over Columbia. The Bulldogs escaped by the skin of their teeth behind the sensational effort of junior Justin Sears, who had a season-high 28 points and a game-sealing block on Columbia guard Maodo Lo.
Harvard, which has won its last nine conference road matchups, will need to flash the ballhandling it did against Princeton (16 assists, 10 turnovers) and not the carelessness it had versus Dartmouth (24 assists, 35 turnovers over two games) in order to extend its streak and keep alive the oddest early season trend.
Allen’s Warm Seat
Despite a lackluster nonconference record, Penn could easily be looking at a 2-0 conference record if it had been able to hold on to a 15-point lead in its first game against Princeton. That loss led the Penn daily newspaper to place coach Jerome Allen on the hot seat. All Allen has done since is notch Penn’s first win over a Philly Big Five opponent (Saint Joseph’s) in 12 tries and take down Dartmouth, 58-51.
Although the school has a new athletic director, it is hasty to assume Allen is coaching for his job. Regardless, the school’s recent upswing has certainly generated enhanced optimism around a program unaccustomed to losing like it has recently.
