After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though it is based on a 2012 French film, Netflix’s “Love Wedding Repeat” feels familiar for other reasons. With its initial sweeping shots of Rome, it could easily be confused for “To Rome With Love,” while its series of intertwining storylines following guests at a wedding could make it “Four Weddings and A Funeral.” In his directorial debut, Dean Craig manages to create a mere facsimile of more successful rom-coms. Unfortunately, his end product simulates the most lackluster element’s of Woody Allen’s failed love letter to Rome, with none of Richard Curtis’s charm. Though Craig’s project boasts a perfectly capable cast and a gorgeous setting, these elements cannot save the film from major character development flaws and an endless, pedantic plot.
Jack’s (Sam Claflin) sister Hayley (Eleanor Tomlinson) is about to get married in Rome. For several years, he has been enamored with Hayley’s friend, Dina (Olivia Munn), but any chance at a happy relationship has been thwarted by pesky interruptions. Jack decides that this wedding is his opportunity to finally win her over, but his plans are disrupted by Hayley’s crazed, drugged-up ex-boyfriend Marc (Jack Farthing) who shows up to ruin the day. Tasked with slipping sleeping drops into Marc’s drink by his sister, Jack finds himself running around fixing the situation when another guest accidentally ingests the sleeping draught.
The film’s central plot device is a repetition of the day’s events à la “Groundhog Day.” A group of children end up mixing up the original seating arrangement and the film presents two potential sequences of the day based on these different arrangements. The first scenario represents a day where everything goes horribly “wrong” and the second half of the film focuses on a day where everything goes “right” for Jack.
To show that there are a number of possible versions of this day, the film shows short, fast-forwarded clips of events based on different, mixed up arrangements. The issue with this is that the film does not justify why it picks these two specific chains of events over any others. And given the number of mishaps that occur in both days, it is unclear why one is a more “successful” version than the other.
It might even be a cynical choice, contradictory in a film that pretends that love conquers all. Are we supposed to believe that Jack and Dina are really meant to be together if the only reason they end up together is place setting? This takes away any sweetness from their ultimate reunion.
But before we get to this predictable ending, we have to suffer through a series of tiresome antics as Jack attempts to both stop Marc from ruining the wedding and win over Dina. Besides Jack’s storyline, the film also focuses on the unstable relationship of Jack’s ex-girlfriend Amanda (Freida Pinto) and her insecure, jealous boyfriend Chaz (Allan Mustafa). They spend most of the film arguing about Jack and their own incompatibility.
The film turns to Sidney (Tim Key), an eccentric bore, and Bryan (Joel Fry), Hayley’s foolish male maid-of-honor, for comic relief, though neither stereotypical character delivers. This is largely because they are cut from the same cloth of one-dimensional idiot. They have no charisma and the tiresome jokes about them are recycled endlessly.
To make matters worse, the main characters are largely unlikeable. We know so little about Hayley and her motivations that it is difficult to become invested in her arc. For instance, her extreme stress over this wedding is never fully explored and neither is her clumsy reasoning to sleep with an ex-boyfriend. Because we've cultivated no sympathy for her, hiding such an act from her future husband feels nothing more than dishonest. What makes it all the more difficult to pity her is her proposed solution to deal with a problem she has created: Emotionally blackmailing her brother into roofying Marc is just morally wrong. In all, she’s a lazily written character and it is difficult to understand why she should be protected from the consequences she faces.
Dina might initially appear harmless, but that is exactly why she’s such a terrible, unbelievable character. If Jack is a sad rehash of Hugh Grant’s bumbling Charles in “Four Weddings,” then Dina is an exact replica of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie. However, Dina’s passivity is hard to buy in 2020. There are a number of occasions where she could have ended his misery and all of our own by confessing her feelings for him. Instead, she leaves all the emotional labor up to him. It’s all the more disappointing given how hard Craig tries to make her sound impressive (giving us details about her journalistic career), but then erases it all by pretending that she is not an autonomous human being capable of independent action. As much as Jack's endless Herculean efforts distract us, no amount of this can make us forget that female agency does, in fact, exist.
Overall, the film is a great disappointment. While it might have some faint glints of humor in the form of Aisling Bea as Rebecca, one of Hayley’s friends, these ephemeral moments get buried under terrible jokes about vomiting and genitalia. To say that the actors’ talents are vastly underused is a dramatic understatement: They are barely allowed to perform these poor excuses of characters. “Love Wedding Repeat” would need a complete rewrite and much sharper material to even remotely reach the level of the films it attempts to emulate.

Michelle Obama hardly needs a Netflix documentary to celebrate her legacy as the distinguished advocate and role model she became over the past 12 years. Nevertheless, “Becoming” accurately depicts Obama's inspiring influence, which has transformed countless lives throughout the United States and abroad. She has not only received international recognition as the right-hand woman to the first –– and, so far, only –– Black president of the United States, but has also made significant strides as a prominent leader herself.
“Becoming” depicts Obama's likeable personality and heartfelt passion for other people’s aspirations, showcasing her life through interviews and conversations with her family and members of the communities she occupies. The film walks the audience through Obama's childhood experiences growing up with a loving family on the South Side of Chicago, pursuing degrees from both Princeton and Harvard, and even the initial spark with her then-future husband, former president Barack Obama. Obama speaks freely throughout the film and constantly attributes her successes to her supporters and life experiences, as is evident in her motivational exchanges with other women, people of color, and individuals from all walks of life sprinkled throughout the documentary. She articulates the difficulties of becoming the target of criticism for many media platforms as the Obamas entered the White House, and highlights the stress of balancing her roles as both a mother and African American leader in “a time of firsts.”
“Becoming” interweaves the struggles of Obama's early life with her lifestyle today to reinforce its central message: that interconnected life experiences can shape our identities. While our experiences are crucial to defining who we are today, each person has a say in who they become. A person is not a static existence, but rather a dynamic and resilient force. Obama herself is a prime example of this. When asked how her life was “interrupted” by the inauguration of her husband, she asserts that while her husband's Presidency has created a new path for her, it only serves as a contributing factor in her identity, which is indisputably rooted in her past. She argues for the roles of both fortitude in the past and freedom in the present in shaping one's identity.
“Becoming” depicts Obama in an empathetic and amiable light. She is a source of encouragement to those who, like her, come from a disadvantaged background and aspire to greatness. Throughout the film, Obama constantly returns to the theme of finding strength in one's own identity, especially in the face of adversity. Her confidence in the youth of the nation and their futures is manifest as she hears their narratives and pushes them to challenge themselves — just as she has — even in times of doubt. Because of Obama's sincere resilience and continuous support as a mother, friend, and wife, “Becoming” draws viewers closer to her relatable story.
In the shadow of former president Barack Obama’s presidency, it is easy to undervalue Michelle Obama’s impact as someone who was “only the First Lady.” Fortunately, “Becoming” does not in any form take away from her rightly-earned ovation — it fully commits to telling her story from her perspective. It does her legacy justice, while instilling faith in a brighter future in the face of incessant issues with distant solutions. Obama's strong-willed persona inspires a more confident future –– one that will not be without trial but, as her story exemplifies, is possible nonetheless. Perhaps inspiration is the true message of Obama’s memoir: Her story is a potential one for all. Becoming and embracing herself is her legacy, and will continue to give others the courage to do the same.

In a time when everything has moved indoors and online, it’s easy to crave the comfort of our own personal temples, the physical spaces which hold a distinct and irreplaceable community. For many, these locales could be a certain restaurant, a bookstore, a park. For the devout audiophiles and music fanatics of New York City, that space was Other Music, an independent record store in Manhattan that prided itself on its unique collection of underground and experimental music. “It was the quintessential place in New York City for people that appreciated music,” JD Samson of rock band Le Tigre says in the newly released documentary, “Other Music.” “It was the kinda place where you could search out things you’d never heard of.”
The film, directed by Puloma Basu and Robert Hatch-Miller, follows the record store, its staff, its customers, and its two co-owners, Chris Vanderloo and Josh Madell, in the six weeks prior to its eventual closing on June 25, 2016, after 20 years as an NYC staple. Despite the timeline of its subject matter, however, the story in “Other Music” rings especially true during the coronavirus pandemic, when independent stores and venues are suffering and people are forced to turn to the virtual realities that made Other Music shut its doors in the first place. “The way things are, [the world’s] on another trajectory, and it doesn’t favor Other Music,” Chris's wife said Lydia says.
The documentary is a powerful eulogy to the record store, told through conversations with those closest to its magic: the staff members who were “experts in a way,” according to Brian Chase from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs; the musicians who felt a deep connection to the store, like Depeche Mode’s Martin Gore; and the customers who constantly flitted in and out of the store’s open doors, stopping to chat with and ask for guidance from the staff and each other. According to actor Jason Schwartzman, you could always walk into the store and find “someone listening to you, and seeing the type of people you listen to and telling you, ‘you’d like this.’”
Throughout the film, viewers learn that Other Music was a place for everyone who wished to expand their tastes, not just the stereotypical music fanatic. “It wasn’t just a record store, it was like a community center in a lot of ways,” says Duane Harriott, a former employee of the store. When closing, co-owner Chris Vanderloo’s wife says that Chris always thought of the customers first, worrying about what they would do without the store’s presence. Women, too, were present from the very beginning, something uncommon in the world of record stores. They were both customers and staff, but their presence was never questioned. “I just come sometimes to look at the wall of vinyl, and it just gives me such a warm feeling,” says Kandia Crazy Horse, a loyal customer of Other Music.
By speaking with the many artists who found their start at Other Music, Basu and Hatch-Miller also celebrate the ways in which the store gave back to musicians. With its free concerts featuring the likes of St. Vincent and Neutral Milk Hotel in their early days, and the store’s overall dedication to finding new music, Other Music brought countless artists into the underground scene. “When someone finds a record that speaks to them, it’s very emotional…. we were trying to connect great art with great fans," co-owner Josh Madell says. As an institution, they were paying attention where no one else was.
“A place like Other Music is only about the community and the people who shop there and the family…. it’s about being a part of something,” Madell says. Indeed, even in the week of it’s closing, the store was a hub of gathering and celebration. It was constantly full, with customers staying longer just to connect with the staff. The film is especially successful in showcasing these intimate relationships between the store and the people who made it what it was: shots linger on the conversations held amongst the store’s countless shelves, in scenes of people crying at the thought of a New York without Other Music to anchor it.
Outside its large windows, life goes on, oblivious to the era that was ending. “The world is changing quickly in so many ways, so much of it is in the digital world now,” an Other Music staff member says. “But the magic of human interaction… it can only be reached face to face.”
The music itself, however — the very essence of Other Music — wasn’t going anywhere. “We are swinging away from tangible places where we meet and have spaces together,” singer Regina Spektor says, lamenting the loss of Other Music. But, she adds hopefully, “maybe there’s a way for the streaming and the listening and the loving of music to swing back to where we can still have these temples.” Due to coronavirus, “Other Music” was forced to forgo its April 18 theatrical release — to coincide with Record Store Day — and was instead made to stream online (through April 30), representing another physical space lost. In this time of quarantine, however, we can only hope our temples will be back soon. "Other Music" is now available to stream on Amazon Prime and Kanopy.

The words “This movie should be played loud” blaze on the black screen at the beginning of Martin Scorsese’s mythic 1978 concert film, “The Last Waltz.” The Brattle Theatre screened the film, which it aptly dubs “one of the greatest concert films of all time” on April 23 as part of their “Music Matters” series to celebrate the release of “Other Music,” a documentary film about a famed New York City record store. Indeed, “The Last Waltz” is a film which begs for its audience’s full attention as it dives into one of the most significant performances of the 1970s: The Band’s final concert featuring various legends of the era, from Joni Mitchell to Muddy Waters.
The Band, a Canadian-American rock outfit known for backing legendary musicians like rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins and folk legend Bob Dylan, was one of the most influential bands of the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, but it eventually came time to say goodbye. “The Band has been together for 16 years, eight years on the road…. we gave the band’s final concert, we called it the last waltz,” said guitarist and vocalist Robbie Robertson in the film. With “The Last Waltz,” Scorsese immortalizes the famed rock group, focusing entirely on the concert that marked the end of their touring career: their 1976 performance in San Francisco’s Winterland Ballroom.
“The Last Waltz” is a concert film, but does not fall into the stereotypical tropes of the genre. Throughout the film, Scorsese expertly mingles artful close-ups of the dozens of musicians who graced the stage that night with wide shots of a set adorned with crystal chandeliers and towering curtains. Unlike most concert films, this stage was expertly crafted to look beautiful on screen. Scorsese also left the band's audience in the shadows, save for its thunderous applause. The effect brings movie watchers into the moment, maintaining a striking illusion of intimacy between the viewer and the band at one of the high points of their career. Scorsese tints the entire film with a warm and luxurious golden light, immersing viewers in the concert space as footage from the show merges with snippets of the group backstage. “We wanted it to be more than a concert, we wanted it to be a celebration,” Robertson said in one of the many backstage conversations.
The Band was exceptional in that every person in the group was a standout — a stellar musician in their own right. With each song, for example, the role of lead singer oscillated between Robertson, bassist Rick Danko, drummer Levon Helm, and keyboardist Richard Manuel, while the rest of the group joined in with The Band’s classic four-part harmonies. Each artist also had their own musical backgrounds, which made The Band a blend of genres from bluegrass to jazz. Their music was, in many ways, a melting pot of their various origins. Speaking of his own home in Arkansas, Helm draws a parallel to The Band’s own musical genesis: “Bluegrass and country music, if it comes down to that area and if it mixes there with the rhythm, and if it dances…. [that’s] rock n’ roll.” The Band, too, were nothing if not rock ‘n’ roll.
Backstage, The Band revealed their struggles with getting started as musicians with no money: Danko and Robertson spoke about having to steal food in their large overcoats when on tour. On stage, however, their successes since were undeniable. “I’d just like to say before I start that it’s one of the pleasures of my life to be on this stage with these people,” says folk-rocker Neil Young before joining The Band to play one of his own songs, “Helpless.” As Young starts to play his harmonica, The Band falls into perfect melody behind him, metamorphosing effortlessly from the rockabilly band that backed Ronnie Hawkins to seasoned folk musicians, their instruments blending like honey behind Young’s playing.
In moments like those, “The Last Waltz” is a celebration not just of The Band, but of the entire era of bell-bottoms, brown leather jackets and the folk revival. It’s a cultural zeitgeist whose importance cannot be overstated, as legends from all over the scene join forces for the one purpose of making music with other legends. The immeasurable talent featured in “The Last Waltz” — musicians like Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond and Van Morrison — is almost too much for the elegantly draped Winterland stage.
Still, the film has its controversies. Robertson, though not the official frontman of the band, seems to be the center of the film. He is featured most prominently in his conversations with Scorsese, and his metallic gold guitar is rarely missing from the shots. In his memoir, drummer Levon Helm criticized the film for Scrosese’s “long, loving close-ups [of Robertson’s] heavily made-up face [and] expensive haircut.” Helm himself, however, is the centerpiece of some of “The Last Waltz”’s most memorable moments. In the film, he leads vocals on what became the band’s definitive performance of their most well-known song, “The Weight” (where The Band was joined by The Staple Singers), in which Helm surrenders completely to the music. Scorsese includes close up shots of Helm singing with his eyes closed, his body turned completely towards the mic as his Southern drawl blends in the chorus’s powerful harmonies. All the while, he keeps drumming, never missing a beat.
In the final song of the concert, The Band’s own “I Shall Be Released,” all their guests join them on stage with Bob Dylan front and center. Here, the boundaries of genre are done away with altogether, as everyone from The Staples Singers to Ringo Starr join The Band for the last time. “Any day now, I shall be released,” they all sing in harmony at the song’s chorus. The whole time, they look towards their fellow musicians, creating a striking sense of community. By the end, everyone is smiling and waving to the now-visible audience. Here, in this one song, is everything that “The Last Waltz” hoped to be: beautiful, harmonious, and unforgettable. With that, Scorsese’s musical masterpiece dissolves into a wide shot of The Band playing the theme to “The Last Waltz” all alone, the camera slowly fading into the film’s credits and leaving behind a relic of a fading era.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In July, we said goodbye to one of the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, Rep. John Lewis. Among the many striking things about Lewis’ career is how early he started: He began his social justice work in his college years, inspired to take action after witnessing and experiencing the oppression his community faced. As a young man, he was a founder and chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, an original Freedom Rider, and an organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. While Lewis’ work and achievements were unique, his experiences represent one critical aspect of so many other historical and contemporary liberation and justice movements: Young people are the ones on the frontlines.
Today, like then, young people around the world are eager to be active agents for positive change.
As Harvard students, we’re no strangers to the power of youth-led movements. From the moment we step foot on campus, we are told it’s our responsibility to help others and are dazzled by hundreds of student organizations that seek to empower communities or shape a better world. I've been inspired by my peers who have marched in Black Lives Matter protests, organized for fossil fuel and prison divestment on our campus, and marched with dining workers when they sought fairer compensation.
From our university alone we have seen many influential leaders and changemakers, but Harvard does not shape the revolutionary. It serves as a platform for those with revolutionary ideas. Harvard students should advocate for similar empowerment for our peers who may not have the privilege of a Harvard platform.
One easy way we can empower our peers is by supporting a bill that has already been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives — the Youth, Peace, and Security Act of 2020. The YPS Act is a bipartisan bill intended to establish a U.S. policy to improve the inclusive and meaningful participation of youth in peace and security efforts. It aims to lower structural barriers, standardize data collection and disaggregation, and prioritize funding and technical assistance to youth-led peace work.
Empowering young people is critical for peace efforts globally. Youth play an integral part of not just building peace in their communities, but also maintaining it. Youth make up 1.8 billion people globally, and one in four of those young people live in conflict-affected countries, according to the U.N. For example, Somalia has a median age of 18.5 years with a population of 11.8 million people.
By shutting out young people from peacebuilding processes, half of the population is ignored. Excluding over half the population makes any peace process temporary at best. One study carried out by the United Nations found that young people “described their experiences of exclusion as a form of structural and psychological violence that is indivisible from their political, social, cultural and economic disempowerment.” Instead, including the population that will inherit power in peace and security conversations makes it more likely that sustainable and long-term peace will grow.
Youth are not naïve or too inexperienced. They are not a problem that needs solving. Young people are best informed in their respective countries’ situations and are eager to be positive agents for peace and security. In Somalia between 2011 and 2017, youth peacebuilding programs funded by USAID substantially reduced the willingness of survey participants to support or participate in political violence. In Burundi, solidarity events between youth and police officers helped defuse a violent dynamic, and 88 percent of police-reported collaboration that outlasted the official end of the program in 2017. These examples show that youth are the emerging leaders who will eventually be making decisions impacting their societies.
As young people at one of the world’s top universities, we know best the value of investing in youth for a better future. American students should encourage their members of Congress to support the YPS Act. This small step, whether it be an email or a phone call, can be a start to supporting youth like us, who dream to — and can — make an impact in this world. An investment in the youth of the world could prove to be an investment in the future Nelson Mandelas, Martin Luther Kings, Yasser Arafats, and John Lewises of our world.
Sahar M. Omer ’20, a former Crimson News editor, was a Government concentrator in Pforzheimer House. She is currently supporting peacebuilding policy work with Peace Direct.

Black and Latinx people imprisoned in Massachusetts receive significantly longer average sentences than white people charged with similar offenses, according to a Wednesday report published by the Criminal Justice Policy Program at Harvard Law School.
Using data from more than 500,000 cases, the report aims to explain racial disparity in the criminal justice system. Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph D. Gants ’76 requested the study after a 2014 analysis by the Massachusetts Sentencing Commission determined the state experiences higher racial and ethnic disparities in incarceration compared to national rates.
The report discovered people of color are vastly overrepresented in the state’s criminal caseload relative to their share of the state’s population. White people are also more likely to have their cases resolved through less severe outcomes such as pretrial probation.
“Although Black people make up only 6.5% of the state’s population, African Americans are the subjects of 17.1% of criminal court cases in Massachusetts,” the authors of the report wrote in a press release. “Similarly, Latinx people constitute only 8.7% of the Massachusetts population but 18.3% of the cases.”
The program’s research also reveals differences in sentence length among those who receive convictions. Compared to white people, Black people receive sentences an average of 168 days longer, and Latinx people receive sentences an average of 148 days longer. This trend holds true even after controlling for alternate factors, such as criminal history, court jurisdiction, and neighborhood characteristics.
“This indicates that much of the disparity in incarceration sentences results from racial differences in the length of incarceration sentences given rather than the overall rate at which defendants are convicted or incarcerated,” the report reads.
Black and Latinx people typically face more severe initial charges than their white counterparts for similar conduct which, according to the report, can increase the risk of longer sentences and result in harsher plea deals.
“Our analysis shows that one factor—racial and ethnic differences in the type and severity of initial charge—accounts for over 70 percent of the disparities in sentence length,” the report reads.
Felix Y. Owusu, a lead researcher for the project, also noted that mandatory and statutory minimum sentences contribute to the disparity because people of color are more likely to face charges carrying mandatory minimum sentences and are more likely to be subsequently incarcerated.
“Even if every single person within the court system — prosecutors, judges, etc — if all those people act in a completely unbiased fashion, you have laws where certain kinds of activities that we know are more likely to be charged to people of color are criminalized more heavily than activities that the white people are doing,” Owusu said.
The report found that Latinx defendants are twice as likely to face a mandatory minimum charge compared to white defendants. It also claims white defendants more often receive shorter sentences than the mandatory minimum.
“Further, existing mandatory minimums are rarely applied in cases involving charges commonly faced by white defendants, such [as] subsequent OUI offenses,” it reads.
There are also sentencing disparities among defendants within ethnic groups, according to previous studies referenced in the report. It cites research finding that Black defendants with darker skin and “African” features typically receive more severe punishments than those with lighter skin and “European” features.
“These disparities can also be seen within other races,” the report reads. “Indeed, within each race, ‘more stereotypical [B]lack features’ are a significant predictor of sentence length.”
The authors’ press release states they hope their work can help legislators address disparate impacts within Massachusetts’s criminal justice system.
“We are pleased to provide the most comprehensive accounting of racial disparities in the Massachusetts criminal system to date,” Brook Hopkins, executive director of the Criminal Justice Policy Program, said in the press release. “At this time of national reckoning about race, we hope this report will inspire Massachusetts to confront the racial disparities that permeate our criminal system.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Plaintiffs’ Law Association at Harvard Law School hosted a forum Wednesday discussing a class action lawsuit filed against Harvard in late June over partial reimbursement of tuition for the online spring semester.
Law School student Abraham Barkhordar filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on June 22, demanding the University proportionally refund tuition to all students for the online spring semester and for any future online academic terms. The suit argues the damages caused by a virtual semester exceed $5 million.
The lawsuit alleges the online semester’s lack of in-person access and collaborative learning environment did not meet the quality of education students when they agreed to pay for their education.
The forum, which was titled “Suing Harvard: A Look at Plaintiff’s Side Class Action Litigation,” featured Barkhordar and two lawyers from the firm representing him, Warren T. Burns and LeElle B. Slifer. William A. Greenlaw ’17, the co-founder and co-president of the Plaintiffs’ Law Association, moderated the forum.
Barkhordar said students missed “small interactions” — such as meeting a friend in a study room or interacting with Harvard professors — and the “wonderful in-person experience that generations of Harvard lawyers” have had when classes were moved online.
Slifer questioned Harvard’s decision not to use its endowment to level unforeseen financial challenges the University faces instead of maintaining its tuition price.
"They are sitting on a very sizable endowment,” she said. “That should be the thing that they use on a rainy day, and if a global pandemic isn't a rainy day to dip into and help out students, I'm not sure what is.”
Law School Dean of Administration Matt Gruber wrote in a June statement on the school’s website that the Law school’s “financial picture will only become more dire” in the next fiscal year. Tuition makes up 42 percent of the Law School’s revenue.
“We expect that projected tuition revenues will fall as a result, in part, of our decision to forgo the planned rate increase,” the statement reads. “This coming year will again produce other significant shortfalls in revenue, including, among other things, substantial reductions in the University’s payout on the endowment and in dormitory revenue, as public health concerns will require us to keep more than three-quarters of our rooms unoccupied.”
“We will offset some of these revenue shortfalls by continuing to reduce operating expenses and travel, and by taking other actions such as eliminating salary increases for faculty and exempt staff. Among major categories of spending, only financial aid and LIPP are expected to increase next year,” Gruber wrote in the statement.
At the event, Barkhordar called the decision to freeze tuition instead of increasing it by the annual designated percentage “garbage.”
“Other schools like Princeton are doing 10 percent off in addition to not raising tuition,” he said. “It’s the absolute bare minimum.”
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal and University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on pending litigation.
Though the event was hosted by the Plaintiffs’ Law Association and Barkhordar is the co-founder and co-president of the association, Greenlaw noted the speakers’ viewers are their own. He framed the event as a “robust discussion” about the experience of filing a class action lawsuit and for “what it’s like handling this litigation.”
Burns, who is one of Barkhordar’s attorneys, described class action lawsuits as rooted in pursuing goals broader than one individual.
“Fundamentally, it comes down to class representatives, plaintiffs, and attorneys who are willing to take the risk of trying to get something done for a broader group than just themselves,” Burns said. “I think it’s more than appropriate to congratulate, celebrate Abe a little bit today because he is someone who has stepped into that role.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair penned a stern email to students living in residence Wednesday after reports of large groups congregating — often maskless — along the Charles River in recent days.
“We have heard about gatherings with large groups of students along the river and in some cases in courtyards on campus,” she wrote. “In the event that you attend gatherings along the river or near campus, drink in public, refuse to wear a mask, or do not maintain social distancing, you are not caring for this community, nor are you abiding by the agreement to uphold local state and community guidance regarding COVID-19.”
Harvard asked undergraduates residing on campus — freshmen and a limited group of upperclassmen — to abide by a community compact that provides guidelines for living in residence. As of Sept. 9, the College permitted outdoor gatherings of ten or fewer participants but continues to bar indoor gatherings.
In her email, O’Dair wrote that while she believes students have adhered to the community compact policies, students on campus need to remain “vigilant.”
“We are fortunate that as of today the semester has been largely successful in terms of compliance with the Residential Community Compact,” she wrote. “While this is good news, I write today to urge us all to continue to be vigilant and gather in small groups and in safe ways consistent with public health guidelines.”
O’Dair also reminded students the compact has teeth. The Community Council — an assembly of select students, faculty, and residential staff — will review violations of Harvard’s social distancing rules on a weekly basis, doling out warnings to non-compliant students.
“When a violation of the Compact is identified, they are empowered to respond in a range of ways, from a warning up to removal from campus housing,” she wrote. “While they are willing to intervene as needed, please do everything you can to avoid putting them in the position of having to do so.”
Reports of gatherings at Harvard come as colleges across the country grapple with students who are eager to socialize. Northeastern University dismissed 11 freshmen last week from university housing after they violated social distancing measures. In late August, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill reported that nearly a third of campus COVID-19 tests returned positive results.
O’Dair ended her note with a call for continued deference to public health guidelines, writing that Harvard students living on campus “cannot let our guard down” and allow “superspreader” activity to occur.
“We know that small, physically distanced interactions reduce the likelihood of infection and super-spreading events and that large gatherings are unsafe,” she wrote. “While a single infected person might not get sick, each of us could spread the virus. We have a responsibility to each other and those we don’t know to do the right thing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During an unprecedented semester of virtual learning, Social Sciences professors teaching large lecture courses say they are working hard to keep their classes as engaging and interactive as possible.
Many professors — including those teaching hundreds of students in popular Economics, Psychology, and Government classes — have completely altered the structure of their traditional courses, opting to include special speaker series, virtual social opportunities, and increased group projects.
Some faculty stressed the difficulty of losing the face-to-face aspect of their large, in-person lectures.
“There's something very energizing and wonderful about having a class full of students and seeing your faces, hearing your voices, and losing all of that was really hard for us,” David I. Laibson ’88, who co-teaches Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” with Jason Furman ’92, said.
However, despite the limitations of the online lecture setting, faculty said they have implemented new mechanisms to keep their students engaged and connected with each other this fall. Laibson and Furman, for example, have made their course more collaborative through new weekly group problem sets.
“The continuous deployment of the group problem sets will hopefully help create social connectedness,” Laibson said.
Psychology Professor Daniel T. Gilbert, meanwhile, has completely altered the way in which he conducts his department’s foundational course, Psychology 1: “Introduction to Psychological Science.”
“The last thing I wanted to do was just a bad online version of the course that I give in a classroom,” Gilbert said. “One of the things that doesn’t transfer well from the brick-and-mortar classroom is lecturing.”
Instead, he said he now utilizes a flipped classroom style, relying largely on lecture recordings taken in the class’s usual Science Center setting last year.
“My first concern was just that the lectures are pre-recorded, not live, but I’ve gotten used to it,” Brittany Y. Sun ’23 said. “His lectures are always very fun.”
During scheduled class time every Tuesday, Gilbert brings in a guest speaker for what he calls “Chapter Zero” — a podcast-style class in which students read a few chapters of a popular book related to that week’s topic, and its author joins the class for a brief interview and Q&A session.
Julia L. Abbruzzese ’24, a student in Psych 1, said she finds the guest speakers’ contributions helpful in understanding class materials’ potential applications.
“All these different perspectives from the people he brings in actually add a really good addition to the foundation in the course,” Abbruzzese said.
Government preceptor David D. Kane, who teaches Government 50: “Data”, said while he strongly prefers teaching in person, he finds breakout rooms to be a good use of class time. Kane speaks a few minutes and then sends the students into breakout rooms to work on problems, while he and his teaching fellows circulate between groups.
He said he already taught his class in a similar, effectively flipped style before the pandemic struck, adding that he appreciates the ease with which he and the TFs can travel from breakout room to breakout room.
“Whenever class is in person, it’s essentially impossible for the teaching staff to move around the room and answer questions,” Kane said.
Additionally, some professors said they look to find ways to enhance the virtual experience outside of actual class time.
Furman and Laibson are hosting a weekly series called “Economics in Action,” which invites different Harvard Economics faculty to give 25-minute presentations followed by Q&A sessions. Upcoming guests include former Social Sciences Dean David M. Cutler ’87 and rising star economist Raj Chetty ’00.
Furman and Laibson will also host two small-group “teas” each week, where up to 12 students can sign up to discuss anything relevant to economics.
Ec 10 student Rachel B. Mehler ’24 said she was not very concerned about the impersonal aspect of a large online lecture course.
“There's a lower expectation of having any kind of relationship with the professors and the other people in the class, but I don't think that that has anything to do with corona,” Mehler said. “It would probably be like that anyway.”
Gilbert said one difference this year brings is that professors and students are equals when it comes to experience with online learning.
“I try to remind the students, we are all first-year students this year. It's all an experiment. And I'm a scientist, I can tell you most experiments don't work,” Gilbert said about the virtual semester. “But they usually provide something interesting.”
Correction: September 21, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that David D. Kane is a Government professor. In fact, he is a preceptor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A host of Harvard departments are offering courses this semester that aim to engage with the racial injustice in America after a summer of protests over anti-Black racism.
Professors from various departments — including History, English, Economics, Philosophy, Sociology, and African and African American Studies — are discussing topics like cultural appropriation, racial and economic inequality, social change, constitutional justice, and the relationship between Asian complicity and anti-Blackness, in their classes this semester.
For some faculty, present-day events strengthened pre-existing themes in their fall curriculum. Other professors have incorporated new readings, guest speakers, and discussions in response to the current racial climate.
The murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police earlier this year prompted a meeting within the Economics department about implementing discussions of race into current coursework. Economics Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron said he followed that discussion by surveying Economics faculty members last month for courses addressing race in the Fall.
“The hope is that students will have a deeper understanding of all the reasons why these phenomena occur,” Miron said. “And they’ll be equipped with tools to think about which policies are likely to be most effective in reducing racial inequality and racial injustices, because economics is trying to be careful in understanding what works and what doesn't.”
A number of fall courses approach discussions of race through a historical lens. During the first week of class for GENED 1002: “The Democracy Project,” a course taught by History professor Jill Lepore, students drew parallels between the 1960s Civil Rights Movement and today’s Black Lives Matter movement, according to Enrique R. Sanchez ’23, who is taking the class.
“I just really enjoy studying history, not just for the sake of learning what happened in the past, but for the sake of taking lessons from that and applying it to our society today and the problems that we face today,” Sanchez said.
Harvard College Fellow Seth A. Robertson said he hopes to bring a similarly critical view to his study on the history of ethics and philosophy. He said his course, PHIL 18: “Human Ethics: A Brief History,” seeks to combat the “old, ingrained narratives of prejudice that have just been built into the discipline.”
Other classes encourage students to look toward the future.
In AFRAMER 189Y: “Sources of Interracial Economic Inequality in the United States,”African and African American Studies lecturer Jacqueline O. Cooke-Rivers said she expects students will gain greater insight into the systemic sources of racial inequality and then consider how to address current issues in the black community such as residential inequality, inequal access to high quality education, and mass incarceration.
Associate Professor of African and African-American Studies and History of Art and Architecture Sarah E. Lewis ’01, who is teaching HAA274: “American Racial Ground” this semester, asks students to examine the relationship between visual art and the hyper-visuality of modern racial injustices.
In the course, Lewis contrasts “stand-your-ground” laws — which studies have shown disproportionately harm Black Americans — with the reclamation of “physical ground” through recently established landmarks like the National Memorial to Peace and Justice in 2018 and the creation of the Black Lives Matter Plaza last June.
Several faculty teaching race-related classes said they think such courses should always form a part of students’ education.
Visiting English lecturer Joan N. Kane said she believes Harvard must offer curricula that substantively engage with race.
“There's a feeling of missed opportunity when you don't have the chance to center issues of the Black and Brown and Indigenous experience,” Kane said. “I think that continuing to pretend as if these matters are resolved, or addressed in other ways, or don't exist can contribute to creating a really harmful and hostile environment for students.”
Abigail Mariam ’15, who is a teaching fellow for SOCIOL 1152: “Conflict, Healing, and Justice,” also said she thinks students benefit from discussing racism in the classroom.
“For people who have experienced racial injustice, seeing that experience of racial injustice brought to the fore in a classroom allows them to see that their experiences, their pain, their soul, their challenges, their joys, their resistance — all of that is important,” Mariam said. “I believe that in working in solidarity with one other, students will be able to find solutions and ways to collectively resist racial inequity.”

Now that classes all occur over Zoom, we no longer need those 15 minutes to walk to the location of our next class. What do you do with this seemingly great, yet awkward amount of time?
Grab a snack.
What better way to spend those 15 minutes between classes fixing up a snack for yourself? We’d be lying to ourselves if we said that we don’t get hungry during class. Snacking may also help make the lecture feel like it’s going faster, who knows? Either way, it certainly doesn’t hurt to use that time to make a quick trip to the fridge.
Actually go for a walk.
For when you’re feeling particularly nostalgic, re-enact the walking to your next class by actually going for a walk. Pack your school supplies, strap on your bag, and make a quick little loop around the neighborhood. Set up in a different room and there you have it. New location, new class.
Take a nap.
Feeling sleepy after two consecutive classes and have another afterwards? Recharge by taking a quick 15 minute power nap, or even just by laying down. A luxury that cannot be enjoyed if it weren’t for Zoom. Just be sure to set an alarm.
Get some exercise.
For those feeling particularly ambitious, get some exercise in between your classes. It’ll help you feel energized and awake. Even though there may be enough time to workout in those 15 minutes, we’re not quite sure if there is enough time to get a shower in. This means that you may have to sit through the next 75 minutes in your sweaty workout clothes.
Zoom through your readings
It’s okay if you forgot to do your readings, we did too. Use those 15 minutes to quickly skim through. While one may say it’s procrastination, it can actually be seen as time management.
Although we also miss using those 15 minutes to scurry by the tourists in the Yard to get to our next class, there is actually a lot that you can do in those 900 seconds. The possibilities are endless.
