After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his op-ed (August 4), Dr. Alex Ocampo shared personal experiences as a student in the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He described perceptions of systemic racism and the department being unresponsive to our students of color. We acknowledge that systemic racism and both implicit and explicit bias are issues that we must continue to struggle against. The gravity of these issues is why, as chair of the department, I must respond to his op-ed.
First, Dr. Ocampo commented on an email that I sent to our department regarding our ongoing efforts to tackle challenges regarding issues of racism, diversity, and inclusion. Our department has long recognized the importance of understanding and addressing the needs of faculty, staff, and students of color and other historically marginalized groups. For nearly thirty years, we have offered programs that demonstrate our commitment including programs directed at recruiting, retaining, and supporting students of color.
We also recognize the need for continual improvement and actively seek input from our departmental constituencies. In my two years as chair, this has included conversations with Dr. Ocampo, at his request, and other students, that have resulted in changes in our programs. The recent email that Dr. Ocampo mentions was not a newfound call to action. Rather, it was a reaffirmation of the department’s (and my own) commitment to our students, faculty, and staff of color, and an attempt to seize upon the momentum of the moment to foster even more open communication and further advance and improve our programs.
Second, Dr. Ocampo provided an example suggesting there is an active effort in our department to drop students of color from the program. While I cannot comment on the confidential reasons associated with any student’s departure, I can avow that we would never actively seek to remove students of color or hinder their success. No one would disagree with Dr. Ocampo that bringing students into the program only to cast them aside would be cruel; there is no moral, ethical, or practical justification to do so and would violate our department’s core principles. We stand committed to attracting and retaining outstanding students of all identities and backgrounds, and providing them with exceptional training so they can successfully move into leadership positions in the field.
Lastly, the op-ed offers examples of Ph.D. students of color who took longer than five years to complete the program. Our students’ needs and trajectories toward degree completion vary, as is natural and expected, making it vital that we work closely with and support everyone throughout their time in the program. Our unwavering and ongoing commitment to the academic welfare and success of our students would never allow us to systematically keep some students in the program longer than others.
While Dr. Ocampo’s perception of our department and its Ph.D. program may differ from mine, I appreciate the significance of his op-ed because it reconfirms the importance of what lies at the heart of my previously mentioned email — the need to communicate more effectively with each other and to better appreciate the challenges that each of us faces, including those unique to our students of color. As Dr. Ocampo’s letter suggests, a continued open dialogue can only improve our mutual understanding and provide valuable insights for how to better support our students of color. We will be convening constituent groups within the Biostatistics department to develop concrete action items related to these issues as we go forward this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics began accepting applications for its new Fall 2020 Stipend Program to fund undergraduates pursuing jobs in politics and public service this semester.
The new addition to the IOP’s programming is meant to offer students financial support for term-time experiences and “allow flexibility” during the COVID-19 pandemic, per the IOP’s website.
Students must be enrolled in Harvard College to be eligible from the program. They must also secure their own remote internships, although the IOP provided a list of resources to help with the search on their website.
The stipend program will provide $1250 for 100 hours of work during the fall semester, and it will “strongly consider” students’ level of financial need.
According to IOP President Amariah L. “Mari” Jones ’21, the “unprecedented nature of this pandemic” prompted student leaders at the IOP to institute the stipend program to “meet this moment in history.”
“Our new Fall 2020 Stipend Program was developed by a cohort of student leaders to help our classmates who are disproportionately feeling the burden of the pandemic by providing financial assistance for internships in public service during term-time,” Jones wrote in an emailed statement. “The IOP's mission is rooted in inspiring students to seek careers in politics and public service.”
Mark D. Gearan ’78, director of the IOP, wrote in a statement that the Institute is “proud of [its] longstanding support of students pursuing summer internship opportunities in politics and public service.”
After the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States in the spring, the IOP quickly transitioned its summer programs into remote formats, allowing more than 175 students to participate in virtual public service internships, according to Gearan.
Over the summer, undergraduates served as interns at national nonprofit organizations like the ACLU and Black Voters Matter, as well as in the offices of elected officials including Atlanta Mayor Keisha L. Bottoms and U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06. Two-thirds of these students indicated in an IOP survey that they plan to continue working with their host organization after the summer.
The Fall 2020 Stipend program will “allow Harvard College students to continue these efforts or take on new opportunities in the most pressing issues facing civil society — COVID-19 response, advocating for social and racial justice, and the 2020 election,” Gearan wrote.
The deadline to apply for the Fall 2020 Stipend Program is Sept. 1.
