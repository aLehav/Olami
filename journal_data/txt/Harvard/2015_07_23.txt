After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What makes a man “hot?” If we take a look at the list of the sexiest men alive—a list that includes actors Channing Tatum, Ryan Reynolds, and Chris Hemsworth—we notice that they all have a similar body type, with glistening washboard abs and rippling biceps.
However, the conventional standard of beauty for men has been turned upside-down with the introduction of the “dad bod.” A term popularized by Mackenzie Pearson in a widely-read Odyssey article published earlier this year, Pearson explains the dad bod as “a nice balance between a beer gut and working out.” Pearson lists several reasons why she (and all girls, apparently) is crazy about guys with a dad bod.
First, girls crave men with dad bods because fit men make them feel insecure about their own bodies, and “we are insecure enough as it is.” Second, girls want a boyfriend who is bigger so that in comparison they seem skinnier, because “we want to look skinny.” Third, guys with dad bods provide better cuddling, because they don’t feel like “a rock.” Fourth, guys with dad bods love eating, and they are “not scared of a cheat meal.” Fifth, a dad bod gives girls a preview of what the guy is going to look like 20 years down the road—relevant because “girls tend to picture their future together with their guys early on.”
When this article was first released, reception was initially overwhelmingly positive. Men and women alike championed the arrival of the dad bod as a celebration of body acceptance, an appreciation of “curvy men,” and an acknowledgement of the unrealistic social pressure facing men to be buff and trim.
But if we take a closer look at the reasons that women provide for wanting a man with a dad bod, it has much less to do with the man and much more to do with the woman herself. If you look at Pearson’s reasons in support of the dad bod, you may notice that most of these reasons have to do with how the girl feels about her own body.
Reason number one: fit boyfriends make girls feel bad for not being more fit themselves. Reason number four: heavier boyfriends love eating, so they don’t make the girls feel bad for having a “cheat meal” herself. And most disturbing of all, reason number two: the chubbier the boyfriend, “the smaller we feel and the better we look next to you in a picture.”
These three reasons are an indication that the dad bod craze isn’t about male body acceptance. As a matter of fact, it isn’t about the guys at all. It’s all about promoting and reinforcing the notion that there is only one appropriate body type for women: skinny.
Don’t believe me? Then tell me why guys with dad bods—the ones who moan about the unrealistic body expectations set by Channing Tatum and Zac Efron—encourage their girlfriends to eat salads or work out. Tell me why Leonardo diCaprio, poster boy of the dad bod movement, almost exclusively dates supermodels. Tell me why men now have even more of an excuse to neglect their physical appearance, and why women are using this as an excuse to further scrutinize their own physical appearance.
The dad bod movement has nothing to do with making men feel more comfortable in their bodies. Such a goal is irrelevant in a world where men have never been subjected to the same physical beauty standards as women, a world where men are judged on their merit rather than their appearance. No, the dad bod movement has everything to do with making women, as Pearson said herself, feel smaller and look better in pictures. It has everything to do with making women less comfortable in their bodies.
The dad bod, therefore, is not a celebration of male bodies. It is a shrinking of female bodies, literally and metaphorically.
While men are encouraged to fill up the space around them with their loud voices and spread legs and now, thanks to the dad bod, expanding waistlines, women are encouraged to make themselves smaller, speaking less frequently and more quietly, and always, always watching their weight.
The easiest way to see this double standard is by asking where the mom bod is. If young college-age guys are allowed to look like fathers who spend their weekends drinking beer and eating pizza, then are young college-age girls allowed to look like mothers who have birthed three children?
The answer is an obvious no. Stretch marks and jiggly arms are sources of shame, plus-sized women are called things like “tractor-sized” and a “female hippo,” and according to one advertisement, women don’t even belong at the beach if they don’t have a flat stomach and a thigh gap.
And what’s more, even mothers aren’t allowed to look like mothers. Women inevitably gain weight during pregnancy, and if they aren’t Victoria’s Secret models with the time and money to exercise for 6 hours every day, most women find it very difficult to lose this weight after giving birth. Yet mothers are expected to look flawless immediately after giving birth. Tabloids regularly criticize female celebrities for failing to “get their body back” after giving birth, and idolize the celebrities who do manage to successfully “bounce back” and look as slim as they did before pregnancy. In other words, even actual mothers don’t have an excuse to look like mothers.
And yet, men, who undergo absolutely no physiological changes upon becoming a father, are congratulated for having a “dad bod.”
So let’s stop pretending the dad bod is some revolutionary and progressive movement, because it’s not. As long as women continue to be feel like there is only one body type they can aspire to, and as long as women of all ages continue to be shamed for putting on weight, there can be no gender equality.
In order for there to be true body acceptance, we need to end the double standards. Personally, I see no reason why we can’t celebrate both mom bods and dad bods. After all, I’m sure reason number three (“better cuddling”) is appealing to everyone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
STAUNTON, Va.—My seven-year-old self would be so disappointed in me. It’s June in Virginia and I’m sitting by the pool at this Howard Johnson’s with a large chunk of my extended family. Somehow, I am not playing with my cousins in the pool, but instead engaging in meaningful adult conversation with my meaningful adult relatives. In my defense, my cousins—all much younger than I am—are playing a game that involves hitting each other repeatedly with wet towels. It looks painful. But the fact remains, I’m having grownup conversations and enjoying them and I would not rather be swimming. I don’t go in the pool once over the entire weekend. This is probably the first step in a slippery slope of adulthood that ends with me using the word “newfangled,” and not in an ironic way.
My various relatives are clumped around tables, deep in conversation, but every so often there’s an invisible adult signal and they turn around, move a little closer to someone, and join new clumps. I am not quite an adult—I can tell by how the conversation often focuses on me, the way adults talk to children: Am I liking college, am I really on the Quidditch team, do we have brooms, do they really fly, what is the point of Quidditch if the brooms don’t fly? But I’m interested in their lives as well—over the years when I wasn’t looking (maybe I was in the pool?), they turned into pretty cool people. I never wanted to grow up into one of them, but now it doesn’t seem so bad.
This is how adulthood sneaks up on you. It starts with a Christmas when you get a few useful presents and are incredibly excited about them (“YES! A cutting board and some command hooks. How did you know?”). And then a forgotten pool. Before you know it you’re regularly choosing comfortable shoes over cute ones, complaining about chronic health problems, and avoiding doing stuff instead of wanting to fill every day with new and exciting adventures. You learn that a lot of times even the doctor doesn’t know what’s wrong with you, and that your relevant grownups and authority figures are oftentimes making it up as they go along.
I know I’m one of the least qualified people to talk about adulthood. I have accepted none of the actual responsibilities that go along with it—I do get bank statements every month, but I use them unopened as bookmarks. I eat my ramen straight out of the package because I can’t be bothered to pour boiling water on top of it. But it’s kind of freeing to admit I don’t have my life together. I have the rest of my life to be on top of everything, although I think that’s a myth. And in the meantime, I can talk to my older, wiser relatives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s this sentimental idea of traveling during your youth, when you’re still young enough for the world to make a lasting impression on you. As a result, a sense of collective wanderlust often descends upon college students—as if, grasping the ephemerality of their formative years, they want to see as much of the world as possible before descending inevitably into hectic and responsibility-laden adulthoods.
I knew I wanted to study abroad the summer after my freshman year. Having had a taste of international travel during the summer of 2012, I couldn’t wait to branch out and broaden my horizons once again. So I went to all the summer study abroad fairs, picking up colorful brochures with supersaturated DSLR shots of Paris, Greece, Seoul, Berlin, London, Munich, Istanbul, et al, and flipping through them longingly as I tried to pinpoint the continent, country, or city that I wanted to explore.
The program that finally caught my eye was an eight-week long course held in Milan and Siena, Italy. It was everything I was looking for in a summer school program. In terms of size and selectivity, it was smaller than most, which guaranteed a more intimate social experience. The curriculum was interdisciplinary and humanities-based, weaving together aesthetics, innovation, and cultural economics. In addition, field trips to art museums, fashion studios, historical landmarks, and adjacent Italian cities were generously sprinkled into the syllabus, emphasizing the real world value of what we were studying.
Particularly important to this program was the duality of cities that participants would be able to experience. The first month would be spent in Milan, a vibrant global capital of business, fashion, and finance. The program would then move to the charming city of Siena, which was actually designated a UNESCO world heritage site for its beautiful medieval architecture. Of course, there was always the tantalizing option of traveling to nearby European countries on the weekends, when we were free to organize our own activities and itineraries. All in all, it was an opportunity that seemed too good to be true.
Upon my acceptance to the program, I was so excited for Italy that I began counting down the days until summer. Second semester flew by in a flurry of activity and summer came as beckoned, greeting me like an old friend. After packing up my belongings from freshman year (Stoughton South, it’s been real), I worked a part-time job in Cambridge, wrote for Crimson commencement, flew to China to visit family and friends, and arrived in Italy, finally, in the middle of June.
Before this trip, the word “Italy” alone would stir my imagination, bringing to my mind some romanticized caricature of rainbow buildings and gondola-filled canals. But Italy is infinitely more than the stereotypes perpetuated by postcards, movies, and Olive Gardens worldwide, and I’ve had the incredible pleasure and privilege of discovering the immense beauty of this country for myself.
Since coming here I’ve visited Milan, Camogli, Sirmione, Vicenza, Venice, Burano, Trento, Florence, and Siena. I’ve swum in shimmering aquamarine waters next to ancient ruins and I’ve stargazed at a celestial night sky in front of the Duomo; I’ve witnessed mind-bending installations of contemporary art at the Venice Biennale and I’ve admired priceless pieces of haute couture at the Emporio Armani Silos; I’ve ridden on a gondola lift up the Italian Alps and I’ve peered out at all of Siena from atop the Torre de Mangia; I’ve downed piping hot espressos with bitter-rich aftertastes and I’ve savored heavenly gelatos with the consistency of silken cream.
Everywhere I look, I see a country rich in culture, contradiction, and complexity, one whose flavors I’ve just begun to taste. Although I don’t know where my next Italian adventure will take me, I have no doubt that there will be plenty more to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Widener Library will extend its hours of operations come term time in response to requests to hold nighttime office hours for the popular undergraduate course Computer Science 50. 
Widener will stay open on weekdays until midnight, instead of the usual 10 p.m., next fall and spring. The change, according to Sarah E. Thomas, the vice president for the Harvard Library system, is a direct response to requests from David J. Malan ’99, a Computer Science professor of the practice who teaches “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
The flagship introductory course’s teaching staff holds regular nighttime office hours for its hundreds of students, and Widener will host the course in its Loker Reading Room until it closes on Mondays and Tuesdays this fall.
Thomas said Lamont Library, which is open 24 hours on weekdays, sees too much nighttime traffic from undergraduates to accommodate the many students who flock to CS50 office hours. With more than 700 undergraduates enrolled last fall, CS50 outpaced Economics 10 to become the College’s largest course.
Previously, CS50 held office hours in Annenberg, the freshman dining hall, and several House dining halls. This year, however, the course will host office hours in Annenberg and Widener only, according to Malan, who described the 100-year-old library as an ideal home for CS50’s nighttime study sessions.
“It's a beautiful space, it's well lit, and it's well equipped with plenty of seats and power outlets for students,” he wrote in an email.
While CS50 office hours will only occupy Widener a handful of days throughout the fall semester, the full library, including the stacks, will stay open for use until midnight on weekdays all next year, according to Thomas. She said Widener staff are planning for an anticipated increase in use of the library, while the Harvard Library—a recently centralized system—plans to hire more employees to accommodate the schedule change.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, meanwhile, is footing the bill to fund the extended hours, according to Thomas. When the Harvard Library requested the additional funding from FAS administrators, they specifically mentioned CS50, she said.
This is not the first time administrators seem to have made major accommodations for the course, which has become something of a cultural touchstone on campus with its hundreds of students, accompanying events, and social media presence.
Last fall, when the College’s Administrative Board tightened its regulations governing simultaneous enrollment in overlapping courses, it granted an exception for students taking CS50. The course also introduced a “regret clause” to its syllabus last fall, which permitted students who violate academic integrity regulations to report the transgression to course staff within 72 hours. They would then likely face just “local sanctions,” rather than go before the Ad Board, which generally handles course disciplinary cases.
The course will also expand to Yale this fall.
