After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On day three of the rowing competition on the course at Eton Dorney, two more Harvard rowers have advanced to the next stage. After a victory in the third heat of the men’s four, Henrik Rummel ’09 and Team USA have advanced to the semifinals. The American boat led the Netherlands from start to finish, narrowly crossing the line in first by just over a second.
In the first heat of the morning the Australian boat set an Olympic Best time of 5:47.06 over the 2,000 meter course. The men’s four is considered by many to be the most competitive race on the men’s side this Olympics.
In the men’s eight repechage, Malcolm Howard ’05 and defending Gold Medalist Canada placed second, coming in just behind Great Britain but still advancing to the A Final.
Howard will row in lane five in the final on Wednesday. Rummel will row in the semifinal on Thursday.
This afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Temi Fagbenle ’15 and Great Britain will take on Canada in a women’s basketball group B game.
The only Harvard athlete in competition tomorrow will be Will Newell ’11 of Team USA. Newell will be rowing in lane 1 of the A-semifinal.
