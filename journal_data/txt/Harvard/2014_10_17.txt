After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­There’s a promising show in the works for fans of humor. “Laughter on the 23rd Floor,” produced by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and The Office for the Arts, is a comedy about comedy. Directed by Boyd I.R. Hampton ’16, the play premieres Oct. 17 at the Loeb Experimental Theater.
“Laughter on the 23rd Floor” follows the writing staff of a comedy show in the 1950s at the height of McCarthyism. As the characters struggle to adjust to a changing audience, they also try to craft the funniest material possible for the show in order to impress the production’s star, Max Prince (Dylan J. Peterson ’17). Prince, a so-called “fallen giant” of comedy, worries that an increasingly Midwestern audience is driving down the quality of the show while also harboring fears of becoming a victim of McCarthyism.
“Laughter” is a comedy marked by more somber discussion. “The stakes are actually higher than a drama…when you’re dealing with something like political censorship,” Hampton says.  Making light of subtle ideas of censorship and xenophobia is no easy task, but Peterson thinks “Laughter” is well-suited for the challenge. “There’s something funny, in a sick sense, about the fall of someone,” Peterson says.
Despite the more serious themes in “Laughter,” the production’s comedy is of the lighter brand. “My primary focus is always to make the audience laugh,” Hampton says. The play’s actors are enthusiastic about the cast’s chemistry, maintaining that it is one of the show’s main strengths and the key reason for its comedic success. “The way our ensemble works together is really fantastic,” actor Thomas W. Peterson ’18 says .
And for anyone still deciding whether or not to attend the play, consider one what Hampton calls one of “Laughter”’s defining characteristics what Hampton calls one of “Laughter”’s: “Almost all of the characters end up bent over a table at some point, in one way or another.”

No one can play a grouch quite like Bill Murray, and he does so in “St. Vincent” with aplomb and skill. The grouch in question is Vincent McKenna, an aging veteran with scant funds and even scanter inhibitions. Within the first 15 minutes of the film, Vincent steals from an outdoor fruit stand, creatively insults a bank teller, has sex with a prostitute he’d previously impregnated, and gets extremely drunk; he then drives over his own fence and passes out on the floor of his squalid apartment. His hedonistic lifestyle changes, though, once he starts to babysit the son of his next-door neighbor, Maggie. Oliver, a precocious middle schooler, begins to teach Vincent about responsibility, and Vincent in turn teaches Oliver how to stand up for himself. The usual hijinks and life lessons ensue. It’s trite and predictable, but the actors manage to draw humor and pathos out of an uneven script.
The movie’s primary flaw is its reliance on cliché. Almost every classic movie trope shows up: there’s a hospital wheelchair race, a family dinner, a tearful standing ovation, a reunion with a beloved pet, an onstage hug, an “I love you, Mom,” and even a “sometimes in life…” There are, of course, the requisite montages set to upbeat pop music. The plot twists are equally formulaic. Obstacles arise and are resolved in an almost mechanical manner, even to the point that it might be possible to work out the entire plot from the trailer.
Granted, plenty of movies thrive on cliché; predictability can create a sense of familiarity and comfort as well as a large profit margin. What makes it so off-putting in “St. Vincent,” though, is its unwieldy combination with “edginess.” The screenplay ricochets from formulaic sentimentality to unsettling harshness, apparently unable to find a middle ground. In one particularly uncomfortable instance, a scene of Vincent and Oliver racing wheelchairs is closely followed by one of Vincent viciously branding Maggie a “deadbeat mom.” Director and writer Theodore Melfi likely intended for the two extremes to balance each other out, but instead they produce the impression that scenes from two different movies are being patched together. This weird duality causes problems towards the end of the movie, when two of the darker plot lines are pushed aside and left entirely unresolved for the sake of an uncompromisingly positive ending. Comedies are completely successful when they commit to being mainstream crowd-pleasers or sharp-edged black comedies; they rarely succeed when they try to be both at once.
The film also feigns greater depth and originality by involving a religious theme: Oliver’s teacher is a tolerant Catholic priest who accepts all faiths in his classroom. Likewise, Oliver petitions to make Vincent a saint, on the grounds that regular, flawed people can be just as holy as martyrs. Adapting Catholicism for the 21st century is a surprisingly ambitious aim for a comedy, but it might have been carried out well; what frustrates it, though, is the tonal inconsistency. The sappiness of the movie clashes with its philosophizing, taking away any persuasive momentum it might have gained.
The movie also toys with the idea of taking on the issue of veteran care, but it never fully commits. Towards the end, something is made of the fact that Vincent is a decorated war hero who has been allowed to slip out of society’s reach; again, though, the issue is never fully explored, and the heavy degree of silliness makes it hard to approach the film as something with a political argument to make.
All of these issues speak to the fact that the screenplay is Melfi’s first effort: it’s ambitious, but often lacking in finesse. Even so, the movie is entertaining because it’s legitimately funny. The humor never devolves into the slapstick or the scatological, and the jokes are consistently clever. Even when a line falls slightly flat, it’s rarely a matter of bad taste or stupidity. The actors make the most of the writing, often delivering the material to perfection.
In fact, the cast is the film’s greatest asset. Bill Murray utilizes his impressive comedic and acting capabilities, making Vincent a believable, sympathetic character while retaining a degree of roughness. Melissa McCarthy also does an excellent job as Maggie: though known for loud, physical comedy, she demonstrates an impressive level of subtlety here. Mostly working as the straight woman to Murray’s comic, she creates a multidimensional character with real vulnerability. When given a moment of comedy, though, she nails it with understated delivery and expert timing. Naomi Watts’s character never transcends caricature, though. As the cliche “hooker with a heart of gold,” her Daka does little more than hobble around on leopard-print stilettos, berating Vincent in a bad Russian accent. She feels superfluous in the movie, just another illustration of Vincent’s degenerate lifestyle. The plot line about her pregnancy is another demonstration of tonal unevenness—the grimmer elements of it are referenced occasionally but never completely embraced or addressed. Still, despite its flaws, “St. Vincent” is a fairly enjoyable experience, neither a must-see nor a total waste of time.

Too often, injustices garner short-term attention, only to fade from the news cycle days later. Against the odds, the protestors in Ferguson and St. Louis have reversed that trend. It is inspiring to see people from all over the country organize demonstrations this past weekend in Missouri.
The demonstrations are part of the continuing reaction to the murder of 18-year-old Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson on August 9, 2014. The movement has grown to encompass not just this specific tragedy, but also the ongoing tragedy of racial injustice in America.
It is heartening to see people join the protests in Missouri under a variety of banners. As these protestors remind us, workplace discrimination and harsh immigration laws are issues that disproportionately face people of color. Black people, specifically black men, are disproportionately punished by the American criminal justice system.
Unfortunately, these are longstanding problems. People’s attitudes often cannot be changed overnight—or even over the course of centuries. The fact that many Americans still inhabit racially bigoted mindsets was made painfully clear a few nights ago in St. Louis, when a predominantly white crowd taunted peaceful protestors with racist and classist language. As long as this behavior is tolerated, racism will remain a major, pernicious force in American public life.
Instances like these can be discouraging, because they remind us that race relations remain a site of deeply entrenched tensions in America. We are reminded that fixing race relations in not simply a matter of changing a few policies. Decades after the Civil War, decades after the Civil Rights Era, we still haven’t found a truly post-racial America.
That being said, it would be remiss to give up hope without demanding short-term changes, including from American police forces. Such changes will not solve the fundamental problems of racism in America—but they can make headway by reining in the most heinous examples of prejudice.
After the police force of Rialto, California required its officers to wear cameras while on patrol, the city saw a drop both in police brutality and civilian complaints. Other cities have started to follow suit, especially in light of the tragedy in Ferguson. Rolling out cameras for police forces nationally is well worth the cost of equipment if it means saving young men’s lives.
Other short-term solutions could include educating police forces about the injustices of racial profiling, and bringing an end to the bigoted practice. Recently, the ACLU has revealed the prevalence of racial profiling right here in Boston. Scraping away at these examples of institutionalized prejudice is a way we can make small—pitifully small—improvements in the lives of our fellow people.
We hope that peaceful protests continue, and that they push society toward reform. These demonstrations should serve as a reminder for us not to forget how far this country still has to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ‘78 rather surreptitiously signed a bill that nominally will cut down on welfare fraud. The practical consequences of this bill for Massachusetts’s lower-income families are severe. It will narrow the disability requirements for welfare recipients, and force women to work into their third trimester of pregnancy.
These new obstacles are only additions to an already harsh welfare program, which is funded by Temporary Aid for Needy Families, a federal block grant created in 1996. TANF is allocated to states, primarily for the purposes of funding welfare and was instituted by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. One of the components of TANF is a family cap, which financially penalizes families for having children while on TANF by refusing to provide for newer children when calculating benefits.
A common argument for family caps might go like this: non-welfare families do not get a pay raise when they have another child; hence, welfare families should not get an increase in their benefits. Sidestepping the fact that this analogy is not perfect—welfare is supposed to give people a boost out of poverty, thus by definition necessitating special steps for those receiving its benefits—argument against family caps isn’t completely accurate either.
In America, we give other social groups incentives for more children. Families not receiving Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children can be eligible for child-care vouchers.  In addition, TAFDC mothers are expected to work even into the third trimester of their pregnancy. Furthermore, welfare families face job-search requirements before they qualify for childcare and transportation subsidies.
In essence, family caps are a way of reducing reproduction based on class. It increases abortion rates for those affected, although rates of pre-coital methods of birth control remain unchanged. In addition, there are the racial consequences of family caps: the TANF reauthorization bill in 2001 noted that there was a positive correlation between a state’s African American population and its likelihood of adopt family caps.
Of course, discrimination against the poor is not a novel phenomenon. I urge you to read Justice Thurgood Marshall’s dissent in Dandridge v. Williams, a 1970 Supreme Court case regarding Maryland’s family cap under AFDC (the precursor to TANF). Justice Marshall enumerates the reasons he believes the family cap violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
Given elitist and often racial implications of the practice, continuing to impose family caps is an odd choice for a famously liberal state run by an African-American governor. If the Patrick administration is interested in cutting costs, this is not the way to do it.
There are thousands of personal reasons why someone might make the choice to have more children: people want a larger family to look after them in old age. They may have moral objections to contraception. They might believe it is their religious obligation to have more children.
Standardizing access to sex education seems a far better alternative to infringing on a woman’s personal reproductive choice. In Boston, groups such as Peer Health Exchange provide much-needed health education. One of my co-workers, who attended a public school served by PHE and later went on to teach in the program herself, said that PHE was the only comprehensive health education resource in high school. When she joined PHE in college, some of her fellow educators (predominantly upper-middle class white students) laughed at how “stupid” pregnant teens must be. What I think is “stupid” is the fact that one’s wealth determines one’s access to information about STIs and birth control.
What the proponents of a family cap have in common with those students is a patronizing ignorance about welfare families. Ignorance, because these critics lack the theory of mind to realize that some people can be raised without the same information they have access to. Fox News offers over-simplified advice to those apparently useless poor people: “Stay in school; get married before having children and stay married; work hard, save and invest.”
Racist terminology is fairly easy to catch. When it comes to class, euphemisms are rampant. Code words for the lower classes can include “uneducated” and “ignorant.” Critics of welfare families intentionally ignore the fact that wealth is linked to access to education, which in turn is linked to careers and income. Instead, they mischaracterize welfare recipients as lazy and wholly responsible for their fate.
The TAFDC family cap (as well as similar caps in other states) punishes lower-income women for exercising their reproductive freedom. Despite all the rhetoric surrounding rights to abortion and birth control, despite the anger the recent Hobby Lobby decision caused, despite the fact that we in Massachusetts consider ourselves to be liberal and progressive, we are standing by as our politicians try to prevent lower-income women from reproducing. This has to stop.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On October 7, the self-described “campus watchdog” Campus Reform posted a YouTube video in which they asked Harvard students which was the bigger threat to world peace: America or ISIS. All of the students responded saying that America was a bigger threat, providing a brief explanation of their reasoning. As has happened in the past, when Harvard students are asked questions that have “difficult answers,” people pay attention.
At first, the discussion was limited to YouTube comments that, in their usual flair, were on average politically charged, offensive, and unenlightening. But as the video spread over social media, more and more people started talking about it. One thing led to another, and Fox News picked up the video. That’s when things got interesting.
Before I go into Fox’s “analysis” of the video, I want to touch on the nature of the answers. Asking people a very difficult geopolitical question point blank and expecting them to represent their full views in a thoughtful yet concise manner is very difficult if not impossible. I think it is commendable that the students produced the answers that they did, providing a few seconds of nuance to back their claims even if they didn’t have all of the facts of the case available to them.
This, however, was irrelevant to Fox News. The first correspondent attempted to concede that there was some legitimacy to the points the students addressed, but then immediately disregarded the substance of their statements after mocking the word choice of some of the students in the video. Then, the panel proceeded to question the patriotism of Harvard’s student body, calling students “snot-nosed brats” who are “dangers to the gene pool.”
Perhaps this is just the kind of sensationalism that we now have to expect from the media, but even then one of the things John Rich said struck me. When he said that some Harvard students were willing to question America more because they didn’t have anyone in their family teach them about America, I felt challenged as a first-generation American. My grandfather did not teach me about the importance of reciting the Pledge of Allegiance every morning. Instead, I had the honor of learning that by attending Boys State, a program hosted by veterans from the Vietnam War for high school juniors. At the program, I learned that one of the blessings of living in this country is that we can hold our leaders accountable for the decisions they make.
Rich admits that America isn’t perfect. But how can you fix a problem without acknowledging it exists? By condemning these students for admitting that America can be dangerous, Fox is discouraging the kind of productive debate that allows for critical self-examination and improvement. At the very least, Fox continues to propel an America-centric way of considering the world (Who do other countries think is more dangerous?), which inherently limits any effort to achieve world peace. It is important to remember America’s positive contributions to history, yes, but disregarding the negative consequences of our actions will only ensure America repeats its mistakes.
ISIS is an immediate threat to the international community and we need to have a strong response to their aggressions. But America makes mistakes that we need to talk about, too, and though this question isn’t the best way to format the discussion, it’s a starting place. As a generation, we need to continue to question the decisions our leaders make in the context of a global community that is more connected than ever before. Most of all, we need to reject that our sentiments are a consequence of a sort of liberal indoctrination and instead take responsibility for what we believe, recognizing the social and cultural circumstances that help us form the opinions we do. The youth have a big part to play in this discussion as the inheritors of the world—why should we let ourselves be sidelined because people think we’re getting brainwashed?
ISIS is dangerous, but not considering America’s impact on the world is more dangerous. Taking an America-centric approach to global issues, though it seems better for us, will prove insufficient. As a part of this school and country, we must never stop striving to make the world a better place and that starts with holding a mirror up to ourselves and figuring out what’s wrong here. We all have a role to play, and saying anything otherwise would be simply outlandish.

This past month marked the 20th anniversary of the release of “The Shawshank Redemption.” If you’re anything like me, your first interaction with the film came through a web search of the “greatest movies ever.” This search leads to IMDB’s Top 250 list, a thoroughly unscientific run-through (even for something as subjective as film rankings). Sure enough, a small film from 1994 that almost failed to break even takes the top spot.
The film’s message of hope allows it to resonate so deeply, even today. You know a movie is universally beloved when people put it in their top five lists even if they’re afraid of sounding trite.
The film’s twist ending underscores this point. Even though Andy keeps his mission secret, the way that he conducts his life is jarring to those around him. It is a beautiful example of a life guided by a seemingly incomprehensible hope.
This hope is what makes him help a prison guard with his tax papers. This hope is what drives him to help a convicted murderer pass his G.E.D. And this hope is what causes him to challenge Red–a jaded convict–to look at his life in a completely different way, and say “I hope” at the very end of the film.
Hope takes many different forms. As a matter of fact, for those who are “religious,” hope springs directly from faith. Faith is a loaded term—but, as a general rule, we seem to be fine with letting people believe what they want to believe, as long as it makes them better persons and, perhaps most importantly, doesn’t interfere with how other people conduct their lives.
I wish that faith was simple. I wish that it was purely insular—something that you could keep to yourself and use as self-motivation when you’re going through a rough day. But real faith is something much more powerful than that.
I do not bemoan the decline of religious affiliation in the United States. My concern is that, with this loss of faith, we have come to misunderstand why faith exists in the first place.
To be fair, many harmful things have come as a result of “faith.” Real faith does not drive believers to suppress and condemn others. Real faith does not push forward a specific social agenda. The reason why “Christians” pass harsh anti-gay legislation around the world is not because of faith. It’s because they do not understand the love that makes their hope possible in the first place.
For many believers, the tendency is to view faith as a nothing more than a tradition, albeit a crucially important one. Unfortunately, this is the general culture among many of the people in some of the most repressive, intolerant parts of the country. This makes faith nothing more than a cultural phenomenon—and a reprehensible one at that.
On the other hand, the attitude among "the enlightened" is to dismiss faith as nothing more than a nice personal trinket that people carry around to convince themselves to be good. The focus is on the fact that, as Voltaire put it, “faith consists in believing when it is beyond the power of reason to believe.” In this narrative, faith is cast aside in the name of trying to find meaning and identity within ourselves.
As a Christian, I advocate for a society where people are loved regardless of who they are. But, because of that same faith, I do hope to challenge people to change their way of life. This doesn’t spring out of hate or misunderstanding. This comes from my own personal experience in having to daily cast aside who I believe myself to be. Faith tells me that, in the midst of a society obsessed with finding an “identity,” my identity is to be found in something greater.
And that’s often the biggest leap of faith—embracing that you’re not simply what you think you are. For me, it means that who I am is not an accumulation of the things I do or the things I like or the people with whom I spend my time. My identity rests in knowing that my hope is found in something beyond myself—specifically, how God views me through the redeeming work of Christ.
This is not a call for people to embrace my faith. As countless philosophers have pointed out, faith and hope don’t make sense to those who don’t have it. But what I do want people to understand is that, for those who have faith, the greatest demonstration of it is to lovingly encourage others to find hope in something beyond themselves.
That’s my hope, anyway.

Scientists and researchers at Harvard’s museums shared their knowledge of fossils, gems, and other geological artifacts with the public this week as a part of Earth Science Week, a nationwide effort to raise awareness about and spark interest in the earth sciences.
On Tuesday, visitors had the opportunity to explore the gem collection at the Harvard Museum of Natural History with Dr. Raquel Alonso Perez, the curator of Harvard’s Mineralogical and Geological Museum. The next day, which was National Fossil Day, a few paleontology graduate students and volunteers led hands-on activities for visitors, including elementary school students, and showcased bones, teeth, footprints, and other prehistoric fossils at the Natural History Museum.
Wendy Derjue-Holzer, the education director at the Museum of Natural History, emphasized the role of the week as a “bridge” between Harvard and the public.
“It’s really important these days, as a scientist, to be able to communicate why your research matters. Whether it’s just for getting the information out there, or, very honestly, [for] public funding. The public needs to understand and value why we should fund these sort of things,” she said.
In partnership with the National Park Service, the American Geological Institute has organized Earth Science Week every year since 1998, reaching an estimated more than 50 million people each year, according to the AGI’s website. This year’s theme is “Earth’s Connected Systems.”
Those involved with the week said they hope it will inspire an interest in the earth sciences beyond the usual oohing and aahing at gems.
“People should be aware of how we are using our planet and what our planet can offer us,” said Alonso Perez, who showed visitors the museum’s gem collection at Tuesday’s event.
The week will wrap up on Sunday with a family event at the Museum of Natural History focused on better understanding life on Earth and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
Mary Blue Magruder ’69, director of communications and marketing at the Museum of Natural History, said that Earth Science Week fulfills multiple goals.
“The objective of Earth Science Week is to engage students in discovering the earth sciences, to remind people earth science is all around us, to encourage earth stewardship through understanding, and to motivate geo-scientists to share their knowledge and enthusiasm about the earth,” she said.
She added that, given increased focus on environmental issues, scientific literacy is valuable for both those who do and do not study science.
“We need to have people understand these issues way better so that they can be [capable] citizens in a much smaller world,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quincy House dining hall staff member Ana Rodriguez was going about her normal routine before work last Friday morning when she decided to stop into Dollar Variety in nearby Everett, Mass. to buy lottery tickets.
Three $10 scratch tickets bore no results, but Rodriguez decided to test her luck once more, this time on a $20  purple “$10,000,000 Diamond Millionaire” scratch ticket, the second most expensive option in the Massachusetts lottery. She began to scratch.
“I saw ‘1 - 0 - M – I – L,’ and I had to make sure my eyes were working,” Rodriguez said on Thursday, reflecting on her unexpected winnings.
In total, the longtime Harvard staffer will take home $6.5 million, before taxes, in one lump sum.
Rodriguez, who is originally from El Salvador and worked as an assistant cook in Currier House for 28 years before transferring to Quincy last week, said the money comes as a great relief. Rodriguez estimated on Thursday that she had spent around $10,000 on lottery tickets in the last few years. At the same time, she said she has been struggling to pay off debts and deal with the aftermath of having her home foreclosed about five years ago.
In addition to paying off those debts, Rodriguez said she plans to use the money to support her nephews, nieces, and siblings. She will first take care of her finances and make investments before enjoying the remainder of her prize.
“My brother and I were going to get a house anyway,” Rodriguez said. “He works at a car dealership. I was going to get a Toyota Corolla.”
As news of her winnings spread, Rodriguez said she has received many congratulations from friends, family, and colleagues at Harvard, where she has recently transitioned into a dining hall checker position.
Quincy House’s general cook, Mostafa Oubtrou, expressed on Thursday warm wishes for Rodriguez, a friend he said he has known for 20 years. Oubtrou said he hopes Rodriguez will make donations to those in need and enjoy the money without spending it too quickly.
When Rodriguez called Bruce A. Reinholm, general manager of Quincy House dining hall, to tell him the news and request to take a personal day, Reinholm said he expressed excitement but also caution.
“Make sure you sign the back of the ticket, don’t tell anyone yet, and go straight to the store,” Reinholm recalled telling Rodriguez.
Rodriguez said she plans to continue working at Harvard.
“I’m hoping to work here two more years to get the benefits…. I’m here to keep my head level,” she added.
Rodriguez said she realizes that with this large sum of money comes great responsibility, and she said she intends to use her winnings for noble causes.
“Like most struggling people who win, I got lucky. Hopefully, I will use it for good,” Rodriguez said.

Opening its doors last month, the Harvard Innovation Launch Lab offers the space, resources, and support of the i-lab for the first time to Harvard alumni entrepreneurs in fields spanning consumer technology, health and science, and cultural and social entrepreneurship.
The last of the 15 entrepreneurial ventures chosen to occupy the space will move into the Launch Lab, a 3,000 square foot space located across the street from the Harvard Innovation Lab, by the end of the month.
According to i-lab Director Jodi Goldstein, the motivation for the Launch Lab came from the difficulties alumni teams face when they graduate, losing their eligibility for i-lab resources.
“Boston is very dense right now,” Goldstein said, adding that students moving out of the i-lab struggle to find space at affordable prices. She said that the Launch Lab allows “the i-lab [to] extend its reach after graduation.”
Alumni interest in the Launch Lab was quick and enthusiastic; this summer, it received 70 applications for 15 spots without marketing the opportunity. Applications continue to be accepted on a rolling basis.
Many teams granted space said that continued access to University resources and outreach capabilities played a key role in their decision to join the Launch Lab, as well as the inexpensive rent. The Launch Lab charges $200 per person per month, less than half the average competitor’s rate.
“Having Harvard as an active proponent, helping us, and talking to us, is something that is really important,” Rose Wang ’13 said. “At another workspace, we may just be another number.”
Wang co-founded Six Foods with two other College graduates to introduce insects as a healthy and sustainable ingredient in common American food products.
Ten of the 15 resident teams, including Six Foods, began at the i-lab while team members were still enrolled at Harvard. Seven teams happened to be co-founded by women, unintentionally bucking the long-established gender gap in start-ups.
While the proximity to the i-lab played an integral role in the Launch Lab’s location, Goldstein described the Launch Lab as part of the first wave of commercialization and innovation in Allston.
“The Allston side of things is no longer going to be the edge of campus,” she said. “In the next few years, there will really be a vibrancy to this area.”
Launch Lab teams had varying opinions on the Allston location.
Business School graduate Phillip M. Strazzulla noted that Allston feels “a little out of the way” from the current entrepreneurial centers in the Boston area. Within three to six months, his team, which created a collection of online courses called LifeGuides.me, will likely move to Kendall Square when the employment of marketing and development professionals increases the incentive to be in a technology hub.
Wang, for her part, acknowledged Allston’s distance but said that for Six Foods, a food venture that does not require as much on-site technical staff as a tech venture like LifeGuides, remaining connected did not require more initiative than the team already had.
“For us, it doesn’t take much to be a part of the Boston entrepreneurial community,” she said. “Being part of the Launch Lab should only add to our experience, allowing us to continue to utilize Harvard’s resources.”
Goldstein said that she would like the Launch Lab to eventually expand and envisions a space ten times the size of the current space. She said the i-lab is studying current teams to better understand how to operate an expanded space in the future.
“This is a startup itself,” she said. “We want to understand the customer experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 16, 2014, at 11:45 p.m.
Edi Rama, Prime Minister of Albania, drew attention to the need for modernization in the Balkan countries and addressed a recent Albania-Serbia soccer game incident at a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Thursday night.
Throughout his speech, Rama emphasized the importance of changing systems in improving people’s lives. Addressing the issue of corruption in Albania, Rama said that systems, not individuals, are responsible for intransparency in the government.
“It is in fact real that corruption had [held] back progress for many years…. People cannot corrupt a system that works. Systems that do not work corrupt people,” Rama said.
Rama said many people around the world know little about Albania. He hopes, however, that Albania will soon be recognized as a modern and vibrant nation.
“They say the U.S. is a place where dreams come true. Obviously it’s not the only one. I hope that among the other places where dreams come true, Albania is one of them,” Rama said.
Addressing a question from the audience about ethnic discrimination in the nation, Rama said that even though Albania is a diverse country, people live in harmony together. To illustrate his point, Rama mentioned that while he is Catholic, he has a Muslim wife and Orthodox Christian children.
“If there is a strong reason I would say loudly  ‘I am proud to be Albanian,’ it is that there is no type of discrimination in Albania towards anyone,” Rama said.
Rama also spoke about an incident that took place on Tuesday during a Serbia-Albania soccer match in Belgrade. The game was suspended after a drone with a modified Greater Albanian flag—created by Albanian nationalists—appeared at the stadium, causing a clash between the soccer players on the field. The flag display aggravated tension between the two soccer teams due to the respective countries’ disagreements over Kosovo, a region which some Albanian nationalists consider as part of “Greater Albania”.
Rama said it is up to the Balkan countries to move forward from this incident and demonstrate that they are ready to be “partners” with the European Union.
“Our problem is to make sure that this fantastic opportunity we have should not be missed, and that we can show the world, we can show Europe, that Balkans are able to move forward and Balkans do not deserve to be isolated as they were,” Rama said.
Audience members reacted positively to Rama’s address.
“I think he was very open and honest about everything,” said Gerta Dhamo, a program coordinator at the Kennedy School who is originally from Albania.
Rajko Radovanovic ’16, an international student from Serbia, said he was “very happy” after hearing Rama’s comments on the recent incident during the soccer game.
“He was able to rise above [the soccer game], and I was really happy with his attitude of not pointing fingers, because that’s what most politicians in the region have been doing,” he said.
Lorena Gjino, an Albanian-American living in Boston, agreed.
“Unlike previous Albanian leaders, Prime Minister Rama has the public’s best interest in mind. Albania has a lot of room for growth and development and Mr. Rama is leading the country towards reaching that goal,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust convened a panel of some of the art world's top critics and curators on Thursday afternoon to discuss the continued importance of art museums on university campuses in the 21st century.
The panel comes just about a month ahead of the scheduled reopening of the Harvard Art Museums after six years of renovation and redesign.
“Today we want to generate a conversation about what that [art museum] means for this University, this city, and the world,” Faust said during her introduction to the panel.
Director of the Harvard University Art Museums Thomas W. Lentz moderated the event. He began by asking panelists what they believe art museum means to a university.
Jennifer L. Roberts, a History of Art and Architecture professor, said that the status of art museums on university campuses as a “luxury” should be reevaluated.
“The term ‘luxury’ is a serious and dangerous one when applied to university art museums and museums in general,” she said. “It’s a public relation problem that university museums have to get over.”
Roberts said that while museums do contain many valuable objects, they should be seen as accessible to the public.
“Treasure is a term that [is] partially applicable to the objects in the museum. When we say treasure we often mean something exclusive, something secret,” she said.
The panelists also discussed the modern museum’s challenge to remain relevant in the digital age.
Director of the Museum of Modern Art Glenn D. Lowry said he believes allowing visitors to take photographs at museums would make art more accessible to the public.
“Use [photo-taking] as an opportunity for people to share not only with each other as they are in the museum, but with all their friends outside of the museum,” Lowry suggested.
Paul C. Ha, the director of the List Visual Arts Center at MIT, said that he was confident in the continued value of brick-and-mortar museums.
“Tech is a great tool for finding the content, but in the end, it is not the same,” he said. “I believe in the power of art.”
During the question and answer session, Lentz responded to a question about what Harvard’s reopened museums will offer by saying that the new museums are designed to be more accessible to students and community members.
“You can enter through one entrance and go out the other without actually entering the museum. The courtyard is going to be a new public gathering space,” he said. “We don’t want it to be a static treasure house.”
The panel attracted scholars as well as students who said they were drawn to event because of the expert panelists.
Samuel Adams, a Ph.D. candidate in Art History at the University of Southern California, called the panel was “a meeting of minds.”
“I am very impressed by the panel, and it is very exciting to hear that they are actually considering incorporating new technology into the museum,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Dining Services served a range of special dishes drawn form Harvard's backyard on Thursday evening during a special New England Harvest Festive Meal meant to raise awareness and appreciation for food and how it gets to dining hall plates.
“A lot of people see food today as a disconnected thing, just arriving on our plate,” said Margiana R. Petersen-Rockney, a Food Literacy Project coordinator. “But there’s the opportunity through efforts [such as the Harvest Meal] to have a deeper understanding of what it takes to distribute and process food.”
Thursday evening's meal brought together locally-grown foods in an effort to celebrate Harvard’s efforts at sustainability. Some of the menu items included Maine lobster bisque, tortellini with Massachusetts gleaned tomato marinara, and Massachusetts apples and apple cider.
“[The meal] brings together lots of the local foods that you’re used to seeing on a daily basis,” said Crista Martin, the director of strategic initiatives and communication for HUDS.
While the meal was prepared primarily with local foods in advanced celebration of National Food Day on Oct. 24, the hope is that the focus on sustainability will continue beyond Thursday’s meal.
Jasmine P. Opie ’16, co-chair of the Environmental Action Committee, said that she thinks the food served on a daily basis in dining halls could be improved with regard to locality and sustainability.
“That being said, I think the awareness [meals like this bring] is hugely valuable,” Opie said. “[Because] we’re at Harvard, our dining services get a lot of national attention, [so] the fact that our dining hall is putting an emphasis on sustainability has a lot of value.”
Despite visible signage promoting the meal, others worried that the values the meal was celebrating may have been lost to busy diners at first.
“A lot of people saw [the meal] was different, but they didn’t realize [what it was really about],” said Connor A. Horton ’18, a representative on the HUDS Student Advisory Committee. “I found myself explaining it to people.”
Horton noted that many people ultimately commented on the effort.
Though Opie said there is much to commend in HUDS' efforts, she added that there is also much to work toward and look forward to. She said implementing sustainable dining is more difficult at Harvard than many comparable institutions because each individual dining hall presents slightly different circumstances, thus fragmenting the push.
“This is where student groups like EAC come in,” she said. “We’re here to say great job, keep going, and actually change the way food is being produced.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Lafayette tailback Ross Scheuerman found the end zone three times to lead the Leopards to a 24-21 win over Georgetown, bringing his total to six touchdowns on the year. Against a Harvard defensive front seven that has dominated the line of scrimmage, Scheuerman will have a tougher day Saturday when the Leopards (3-3, 1-3 Patriot) face the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) at Harvard Stadium. The Crimson leads the Ancient Eight in run defense, allowing just 75.5 yards rushing per game.
In fact, even after an almost complete turnover of the secondary, Harvard also leads the league in pass defense, a testament to the strong leadership within the remaining veterans in the defense.
“All the linebackers have stepped up,” junior linebacker Eric Medes said. “We had six seniors in the secondary last year, and they’re all gone, so it’s good to have everyone step up, and the D-line’s doing a great job.”
The matchup with Lafayette will be Harvard’s final non-conference matchup, and more importantly, the final tuneup before the squad heads into the bulk of Ivy season. While the defense seems to have answered most of the questions raised at the beginning of the season, the injury-riddled offense appears to have more question marks heading into the fifth game of the year.
Senior quarterback and preseason starter Conner Hempel left the Crimson’s season opener against Holy Cross early in the first quarter due to a back injury. Though he returned later in the game, the signal-caller has yet to see playing time since the first week, and has just returned to practice this week.
Joining Hempel on the sidelines for most of the first few games was junior tailback Paul Stanton, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the preseason and has had limited touches since. Crimson coach Tim Murphy elected to use Stanton in the second half of last week’s matchup against Cornell only when the offense was struggling to score.
Murphy said in an interview Wednesday that while Hempel is day-to-day and questionable for Lafayette, Stanton should be ready to go.
“We feel really good about our backfield right now for the first time in a long time,” Murphy said. “Individually, kids have done a really good job, probably since the first week of preseason, of being healthy."
If Murphy chooses to rest Hempel another week—likely the case, as this Saturday’s game carries no weight in the Ivy League title race—junior quarterback Scott Hosch will take the reins for the fourth straight week.
Hosch has led the team to three consecutive wins, but his inexperience showed early on against the Big Red when he threw a pick on Harvard’s first offensive possession. The offense struggled with ball security early on, turning the ball over four times in the first half.
Buoyed by the return of Stanton, the Crimson put together an offensive surge in the second half, but a late turnover yielded a Cornell touchdown, preventing Harvard from notching its first shutout of the season.
“We don’t have many offensive goals besides ball security, and if you do that, everything else seems to take care of itself,” Murphy said. “We didn’t do that, and in a negative aspect, everything took care of itself, and that’s just the way it works.”
Unlike against Cornell, Harvard will have the added challenge this week of facing a school with athletic scholarships to offer. The Patriot League—which for most of its history adopted an Ivy-esque no athletic scholarship policy—began allowing its schools to offer merit-based athletic scholarships to football players in 2012, and Lafayette signed its first scholarship class that spring.
With two scholarship classes now under their belts, the Leopards may be playing with a higher talent level, but Murphy sees this as further motivation for his squad.
“We really feel like we’re a program in a league that can compete with FCS scholarship schools,” Murphy said. “Does it make it more challenging? Yes. It also makes it in some ways more appealing from our players’ standpoint, who feel that we’re up to that challenge.”

In advance of the dunk contest at Crimson Madness, men's basketball writer Jacob D. H. Feldman conducted a survey of each contestant about their dunking styles, inspirations, and more. 
Q: Which dunker have you modeled your game around?
Sophomore forward Zena Edosomwan: Shawn Kemp.
Senior wing Wesley Saunders: Dwyane Wade.
Senior forward Jonah Travis: None... Every dunker has modeled their game around mine.
Junior wing Agunwa Okolie: I have modeled my game after Paul George.
Freshman forward Chris Egi: Shawn Kemp. I try and emulate his flair and raw power.
Q: What relevant experience do you have that you feel will help you in the dunk contest?
Edosomwan: This is my fourth dunk contest so I feel comfortable in these events.
Saunders: My experience from last year's dunk contest and my innate ability to improvise.
Travis: I taught Blake Griffin and Vince Carter. They've done alright for themselves.
Okolie: Trying to defend my title from last year.

Q: Who will be your biggest competition on Friday?
Edosomwan: Everyone is my competition.
Saunders: Agunwa.
Travis: Nobody.
Okolie: Chris Egi.
Egi: Agunwa. He won the contest last year and I know he's got some good ideas.
Q: If you could dunk on one person, living or dead, who would it be and why?
Edosomwan: LeBron, because he's the most athletic guy in the league.
Saunders: Shawn Kemp, because he deserves payback for all the people he dunked on and embarassed afterwards.
Travis: Ryan Gosling for taking Eva Mendes from me. James Naismith, just to show him how far the game has come.
Okolie: I would dunk on Carmelo Anthony because it would be eventful to dunk on one of my favorite players.
Egi: Probably have to be President Obama.
Q: If your dunking style was an animal, which animal would it be, and why?
Edosomwan: It would be a Liger, a lion and a tiger.
Saunders: A gazelle, graceful and effortless.
Travis: Probably Beast Boy from Teen Titans. He was every animal.
Okolie: I would say my dunking style would be a cheetah because it's both quick and has finesse.
Egi: A kangaroo, because we both can jump and I've got a few tricks in my pouch.
Q: Why are you sure you will win Friday?
Edosomwan: I have some tricks up my sleeve that will hopefully work.
Saunders: It's gotta be the shoes.
Travis: See all of the above.
Okolie: My experience and confidence coming in
Egi: I've got some creative and fun ideas.

The weather these past few weeks has been as fickle as a freshman boy, but summer is fading fast. Before it’s too deep into the Massachusetts winter, it may be a good time to take advantage of this meteorological confusion and jump off the John W. Weeks Footbridge. If you’re not sure whether or not you’re ready, here are some some pro’s and con’s to inspire your thinking as you ponder this decision.
Pro: This jump could serve as a warm-up to get you ready to tackle the official Big Three. In fact, it’s quasi-required. Post-jump, you’ll be 25 percent closer to accomplishing the four essential pre-graduation tasks for every Harvard student.
Con: The Charles River is gross. Does anyone know what’s in that water? Submerging yourself is definitely nastier than licking the foot.
Pro: Nothing is as cool as the GoPro video of you jumping that you will inevitably post to every social media site.
Con: Actual physical danger. The bottom of the Charles is covered in glass and there are sharp rocks on the climb back out of the river. On the plus side, this problem can be solved with a good pair of water shoes.
Pro: Walking down to the river takes up a lot of time and is a great rationalization for why you aren’t studying for one of your many midterms.
Con: It might be illegal. But no one really knows for sure.

3) Spending the entire day in pajamas: feeling #blessed about putting in negative effort to try and look good because no one judges you for those weird pajama pants in the comfort of your own room.
4) Partying: also known as drinking to forget about how badly you might’ve done on last week’s midterm, and if you need drink inspirations.
