After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since Virgil decided he could best glorify his emperor with the characters and style of Homer, the spin-off has been a prominent literary form. Writers such as Jean Rhys (“Wide Sargasso Sea”) and Gregory Maguire (“Wicked”) have achieved success through exploring unaddressed aspects of classic works; the best of these have managed to illuminate these aspects of the story while strongly maintaining their connection to the source material. In more recent years, however, the line between the literary spin-off and a genre of somewhat less repute—fanfiction—has blurred to the point that it is not clear into what category some novels published today may fall.
To criticize “Longbourn” as falling on the fanfiction side of this boundary, however, would miss the point entirely. Author Jo Baker’s attempt to create a hybrid of “Downton Abbey” and “Pride and Prejudice” in which the Bennets’ servants take on the primary roles may actually be farther from fanfiction than “The Aeneid” in that it bears almost no resemblance to the source material. Throughout the novel, Baker struggles to remind her reader that her book is written in the context of Austen’s own novel: she herself did not invent the upstairs residents of Longbourn. She does so most prominently by commencing each chapter with a quote from “Pride and Prejudice,” a strategy that, given Austen’s predisposition toward sharp witticisms, could prove entertaining and useful. Baker, however, selects meaningless and strictly plot-related excerpts: one chapter even commences “Saturday…Sunday” as if the days of the week are somehow evocative of the original novel. Many of the quotes are comparably vague and could only be recognized by a fanatic—but such a reader would know Elizabeth and Darcy’s story so well that the quotes would not need to serve their orienting purpose.
Beyond this, the novel scarcely connects to its source material beyond its peripheral mention of the Bennet family and inclusion of the novel’s major plot points. Thematically and tonally, it is disorientingly different than Austen’s novel. Baker has, for example, made the jarring and unnecessary choice to utilize profanity in her adaptation. Her narrative voice is also completely antithetical to Austen’s: her characters’ thoughts are stated frankly and dramatically, as when Sarah, the novel’s protagonist, has something of an existential revelation and “knew now…why their continuance in this sequestered place was entirely worth the while.” One cannot help but draw contrasts with the more subtle emotions and revelations of “Pride and Prejudice” while reading. Such outright declarations feel painfully juvenile.
“Longbourn” succeeds when Baker hearkens back to Austen: Sarah nearly runs away with one of Mr. Bingley’s servants à la Lydia, and her ultimate love interest has a tense moment with Mr. Wickham like Mr. Darcy did. The themes and implications of Austen’s work do at times carry over well. These moments, however, are few; “Longbourn” seems mostly an unrelated documentation of a set of servants working in a 19th-century British home.
This could make a fine novel, were it well written and crafted. Unfortunately, “Longbourn” is neither a successful adaptation nor a successful novel in and of itself. Another one of Baker’s missteps is her decision to address the experiences of the other servants who work alongside Sarah by abruptly transitioning to their points of view, so suddenly that it is not always immediately clear any change has occurred. Occasionally, a paragraph or two will be devoted to the perspective of another servant, in the midst of a portion seemingly restricted to Sarah’s perspective. This is simply clumsy writing, and it is furthermore unnecessary: the novel would have felt far more contiguous and tight had Sarah been the sole third-person narrator. Other aspects of the novel are similarly addressed without finesse—for example, it is not clear that one of the characters is a child until halfway through the book.
These shortcomings all cloud what appears to be Baker’s primary goal in writing her novel: to bring attention to the unpleasantries masked by Austen’s narrowly focused works. When Sarah, for example, encounters Mr. Bingley’s mulatto footman, she wonders if he is “what they called a black man, then, even though he was brown? An African? But Africans were cross-hatched, inky, half-naked and in chains.” In these moments one is suddenly reminded of the historical context of “Pride and Prejudice,” especially the many groups of people completely ignored in Austen’s body of work. Baker thus does succeed in not only enriching her own novel, but her source material as well. Similarly, Baker contradicts the judgments of Elizabeth and Austen, as when Sarah thinks of Mr. Collins, “He was just a child himself…. And lonely. He was the kind of man who probably always would be.” Here, Baker wonders convincingly whether we are perhaps too hasty in abandoning ourselves to Austen’s assumptions, if the examination of her works requires a more neutral eye. She challenges one of the best novelists and succeeds: an accomplishment, despite the novel’s other shortcomings.
For a devoted Austen aficionado, then, “Longbourn” is perhaps worth reading—it is a task of only a few hours, if one can keep one’s bearings amid the constant changes of voice. But what “Longbourn” achieves could have been encapsulated much more neatly and effectively in a short work of criticism rather than a 330-page novel. Clearly, Jo Baker knows Austen and has thought about her works substantially and creatively. She has simply, through the majority of “Longbourn,” neglected to reflect that knowledge.

Remember mixtapes? Crimson Arts does. Welcome to our biweekly feature, where we create mixtapes for every emotion and every season—for breakups, breakdowns, and breakdancing. This week our mixtape is dedicated to pop-punk and teen angst. Listen along.
 
“Chicago Is So Two Years Ago,” Fall Out Boy 
Any discussion of pop punk or millennial emotion that doesn’t center on Fall Out Boy is 100% pointless. “Take This To Your Grave” remains the purest expression of pop punk available, before irony and showmanship began to outshine the earnest woes of restless young adults. Patrick Stump’s nostalgic crooning for Chicago on this track made me homesick before I had even left.
 
“You’re So Last Summer,” Taking Back Sunday 
Being a teen is about wholly investing oneself emotionally in ideas and people with little to no concern for rationality or prudence. No band better conveyed this reckless regard for melodrama than Taking Back Sunday, with lines like “The truth is you could slit my throat / And with my one last gasping breath / I’d apologize for bleeding on your shirt.”
 
“I’m Not Okay (I Promise),” My Chemical Romance 
Speaking of melodrama, My Chemical Romance took everyday angst and elevated it to a theatrical level. With every note of the screeching guitar solo and every chant of “I’m not okay,” Gerard Way reveals the depth of his conviction in that operatic disavowal of the idea that he was, in any way, okay. 
 
“Adam’s Song,” Blink-182 
From the grand pyrotechnics of My Chemical Romance, we come to the humble melodies of Blink-182. “Adam’s Song” is a sober look back upon the brighter days of 16 and the steps that lead up to a life defined by depression. While the subject matter is dark, Mark Hoppus tells such an alluring tale of youthful optimism that it is difficult not to hear a bit of hope in the song.
 
“Anaconda Sniper,” Title Fight
Title Fight, like the best pop punk bands, define themselves not by complex instrumentals or virtuosic vocals, but rather through their ability to distill the maelstrom of the teenaged psyche into three-minute bursts of energy. The biting power chords of “Anaconda Sniper” punctuate simple cries of ill temper that could be transcripts of conversations between any two high schoolers.
 
“You’re Not Salinger. Get Over It,” The Wonder Years 
The Wonder Years are a much smarter pop punk band than most might give them credit for. With their imaginative song structures and use of multiple vocal melodies, they use the familiar brush of suburban frustration to create tracks that are at once genuine and ingenious. When they rally for the climactic gang vocal at the end of the song, there is an undeniable crackle of energy as they shout, “Chin up, and we’ll drown a little slower.”
 
“Ocean Avenue,” Yellowcard 
I remember Yellowcard for two things: “Ocean Avenue” and convincing me that violins could be cool. The chugging, syncopated rhythm of the guitar and the charmingly nasal narrative paint a picture of a young love against the world that struck a chord in my predictably lovelorn teenage heart. It never got realer for my 15-year-old self than the lyric “We’re looking up at the same night sky / We keep pretending the sun will not rise.”
 
“Swing Swing,” All-American Rejects 
Everything important about this song is summed up in the line, “Do you know what it feels like, being alone?”
 
“Best of Me,” The Starting Line 
Pop punk bands are not very diverse in their tales of romance—they either believe unflinchingly in the promise of love, or they believe unflinchingly that they were the victim of a heartless transgression executed by some icy she-devil. “Best of Me” is a dazzling example of the former, championing the type of positivism that all but requires naiveté to thrive.
 
“Cute Without The “E” (Cut From The Team),” Taking Back Sunday 
Taking Back Sunday specialize in songs of unsympathetic portrayals of the perpetrators of heartbreak, heaping blame on others while heaping pity on themselves—and they did it better than anyone. As Adam Lazarra wails, “Why can’t I feel anything from anyone other than you?” John Nolan murmurs in the background, “I won’t ever ask if you don’t ever tell me, I know you well enough to know you never loved me,” creating a sonic experience that is irresistibly self-indulgent in its sadness.
 
“Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy,” Fall Out Boy 
I could write pages on what this song means to me. Its message is a simple, timeless plea to an unimpressed object of affection, “You need him, I could be him. I could be an accident, but I’m still trying, and that’s more than I can say for him.” The piercingly sincere lyrics coupled with Stump’s acrobatic vocals make for an anthem of unrequited teenage love. To this day, I’m still wondering where your boy is tonight.

What on earth do incarcerated women and Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” have in common? Absolutely nothing, you may think. I thought similarly until I saw an incredible all-female production last week of “Julius Caesar” at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York. Modern re-imaginings of Shakespeare are of course nothing new—and sometimes, they are painfully terrible. But this version of “Julius Caesar,” directed by Phyllida Lloyd of “Mamma Mia” and “The Iron Lady” fame, is entirely successful in its creativity and innovation. Lloyd sets the classic play of “Julius Caesar” in a prison, with all female felons playing the different characters. It may sound too far-fetched, but as one New York Times reviewer put it about the play’s London production with the same cast: “Who would have guessed that the London production currently boasting the greatest testosterone also happens not to have a single man in its cast?”
  The premise of the production is that female criminals in a high-security prison have decided to act out the play “Julius Caesar.” It’s never explicitly stated why they have chosen to do this but it is suggested that it is a form of liberation from the usual routine of life in incarceration. The production stays true entirely to the original Shakespearean script, with only o e or two interruptions in which prison inmates get out of hand and guards have to step in and restore order. Props are improvised prison materials, such as the Brutus and co.’s red kitchen gloves that emerge once they kill Caesar. At the end of the play, alarms go off to signal that the inmates are expected to return to their usual routines now that the fun is over. After two and half hours (no intermission) of pulsating intensity, each woman has to shed her Shakespearean character and return to her cell.
  There’s not a minute of Lloyd’s “Julius Caesar” that is not entirely believable. From the minute you step into the warehouse, you become part of the prison. Sullen guards usher audience members inside. Even the bathrooms live up to the atmosphere; signs in the stalls warn inmates to report sexual assault. By the time the play opens, you truly feel like you are inside the tightly controlled world of confinement. But it’s the acting of the prisoners/Romans that really makes an incarcerated “Julius Caesar” seem completely natural. Each actor, especially veteran Harriet Walter as Brutus and Jenny Jules as Cassius, offers a raw emotional energy that gives the famous words new life. It is a jarring punch to the nervous system to watch desperate women who have nothing but time on their hands play men with all the power in the world.
  “Julius Caesar” is a play that breathes violence and hate: Cassius’s “lean and hungry look,” the rousing speech of Antony after Julius Caesar’s death, the suicide of Brutus. Hate lurks behind every smile, and power, even if it seems stable, can topple over at any moment. When you describe “Julius Caesar” in these terms, you can see the strong parallels between the ancient world of Rome and the modern universe of the steel cell and the orange jumpsuit. Like Rome, prison is a place where power is constantly bubbling over, threatening to explode, and the constant quest to be “top dog” is also one of survival. In both worlds, backstabbing is not just an activity, it’s an art form (and I think it’s safe to argue that politicians and cliques of women are probably the best at it). The claustrophobic nature of ancient Roman politics is heightened even more in the tense, closed world of a female prison. As an audience member, I could almost taste the how static and closed the air was once the “guards” shut the gates and we were ushered inside.
But prison is not just frightening and dangerous, it’s also sad—and “Julius Caesar” is too. Amid the drama and the excitement, it’s easy to forget the tragedy of failed morality and confused loyalty. Friends become enemies and enemies become murderers. Appropriately, then, Lloyd’s “Julius Caesar” ends on a bitterly painful note. As the guards usher the inmates off after the play is over, the inmate who played Brutus stands off to the side, crying. The guards tell her to hurry up and as she brushes past them, the devastation on her face is palpable. From the fiercely strong Brutus, she transforms back into a woman whose daily life is one of humiliation and fear. She returns to a state in which glory is gone and passion is strangled.

It takes 30 minutes to get from the sleepy seaside town of Beverly into downtown Boston. It takes half of that time to get through “Sycamore,” the 2009 anthem of Beverly band Caspian, but the journey is essentially the same. The songs starts with an acoustic guitar line so sleepy, hesitant, and peaceful it’s difficult to imagine even leaving that sonic space. But the wheels start to turn, the riff picks up momentum, and soon a woozy bass and pulsating drum beat enter, as if to simulate the rumble of rubber wheels down the cement number 1 highway. Then the guitars turn electric, drum cymbals crash furiously, and the song is enveloped in a roar of frenzied, industrial metallic feedback. The city has arrived, with all of its hum and density.
 
Caspian have made this trip many times. They have made the specific trip from Beverly to the Boston area hundreds of times, shuttling back and forth from home to gigs at places like the Middle East and the Sinclair. But they’ve also completed the musical journey of “Sycamore” at concerts from Dublin to Austin to Paris. Despite local roots, Caspian is geographically transient, and their wordless, symphonic music has resonated emotionally around the globe.
 
I met Caspian at the Sinclair in Harvard Square, at the juncture between a mammoth 23-show European tour and a cross-country North American road trip. Understandably, they’re exhausted. “It’s not the lack of sleep, it’s the transience of it all,” guitarist Philip Jamieson explains to me. “Just floating from place to place and not being able to sit still, or even exist somewhere for more than 10 or 12 hours.”
 
The weariness is apparent in Jamieson’s voice when he addresses the crowd at the beginning of the show. “Hi Boston, it’s nice to be home for a little bit,” he murmurs. But just as they do on “Sycamore,” the band picks up speed and energy throughout the set, adding guitar with increased fervor.
 
The music they play is technically “post-rock,” a term created in the early 2000s for bands playing non-rock songs with rock instrumentation. Though Jamieson balks at the term—“it feels a little pretentious,” he says—they’ve clearly adopted a post-rock tradition made famous by Explosions in the Sky and Caspian’s heroes, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, that is heavily reliant on gigantic builds. Caspian liken their songs to symphonies: they present order or peace, then destroy it. Sometimes they piece harmony back together again; more often their songs end in a blaze of primal noise and energy.
 This entropic descent is most clearly exhibited by Jamieson, who shows no fatigue when he’s ripping through epics like 2012’s “Gone in Bloom and Bough.” He’s a very tall man who commands the stage by flailing his limbs in every direction; they just might be the “ The Four Trees” for which the band’s 2007 album is named. “I’m not super fun. I think everyone agrees,” he tells me morosely before the set. It’s true. But fun isn’t at all what Caspian is going for. They aim for immersion. “We’ll play in any four walls where you’re able to completely get enclosed in the sound,” Jamieson says.
 
The band has attempted to enclose audiences for 10 years in every corner of the globe, including in Guangzhou, China for the Qiangyuan Music Festival in 2010 and in Zottegem, Belgium for the Dunk!festival in 2011. In May, they played at the first Boston Calling music festival in City Hall Plaza, which “didn’t seem like really great idea at the outset...but was probably the best day of my life,” Jamieson confesses. Now, they’re on tour to promote their newest release, “Hymn for the Greatest Generation,” a grab-bag EP of new originals, a demo, and remixes.
 
The album title references Tom Brokaw’s label for the generation who fought World War II and gave birth to the baby boomers. Within the title track, there’s a heavy feeling of nostalgia and reverence for their grandparents’ generation. But at the same time, the band lists essential influences spanning every single generation since then, from Led Zeppelin to Rush to Prodigy to Godspeed, even to dubstep. “I think playing post-rock is a reaction of me getting into [EDM], that heavier electronic music sound,” drummer Joe Vickers says.
 
There are very little indicators in Caspian’s music as to where they are from or in what era they exist. But it’s this universality, and their integration of many references, that’s made them successful all over the world. If you close your eyes and put on “Hymn for the Greatest Generation,” you might hear the crash of the waves at the beaches of Normandy...then again, it might just be the engine roar of a car as it leaves Beverly, Massachusetts, on the way to another late-night gig.

After a semester of covering television news for Crimson Arts, I have learned that a job that requires watching television and doesn’t require leaving my room is probably not the best for my health and hygiene. I’m not sure if I would be happy being a traveling writer, but my face would probably be sun-kissed rather than aglow with a laptop screen tan. However, writing “You Are What You Watched” has taken me from Litchfield Penitentiary, the prison that holds “Orange is the New Black,” to McKinley High, the school where students burst into song in the name of “Glee,” and even 16th-century France, the site of Mary Queen of Scots’s scandalous teenage romps, at least as depicted by “Reign.” With my last column, I want to share some of the sights I have seen along the way that didn’t make it to the page before.
 
We are running out of history to adapt.
 
Though certain series such as “Mad Men” make the case for bringing the past back to life and onto our screens, newer series illustrate that some things are meant to be forgotten. The CW is currently developing a drama about ballet-dancing sisters in 1880s Paris, one of whom becomes the muse for painter Edgar Degas. The only demographic I can imagine this appealing to is art history majors who have lost their remotes. Though this is an artifact of fictional history, another series in the works centers around “Hourman,” a DC Comics hero created in 1940, whose superpower is the ability to see one hour into the future. The only thing Hourman can save me from is having to watch the series. I could ask him if it was worth it, he would say, “No, run for your life,” and I could watch something else.
 
Though I disagree with Barney Stinson’s saying that “new is always better,” old isn’t necessarily better either. Some things are meant to stay in the past. How networks obsessively recycle history illustrates not only a lack of creativity but a type of nihilistic nostalgia. It suggests that we are running out of stories to tell and have to look at the past for events of importance, resorting to looking between the lines of textbooks to find history that remains untouched. Though familiar stories may earn a viewer’s recognition, that doesn’t mean they will hold interest.
 
 The line between fiction and reality is blurred in television.
 
I’m not going to talk about reality television. What I mean by this blurred line is that by virtue of producing episodes over extended periods of time, television has a more personal relationship both with its audience and its creators. A movie is created in a one-time process, while television series can last for years, and their characters change over time with the audience. This effect is particularly clear in some recent events in television. After “Breaking Bad” ended, a funeral was staged and a fake tombstone erected for Walter White in Albuquerque. The tombstone was removed after family members of actual deceased in the cemetery complained that fans were crowding the cemetery and even stepping on graves. I wrote previously about how the death of Cory Monteith was incorporated into the series “Glee” and how his character’s death was shrouded in mystery in order to allow it to be applicable to Monteith’s own circumstances. The most innovative event, however, was how “The Simpsons” memorialized the death of an actress by letting her character, Edna Krabappel, retire from teaching at Springfield Elementary. Rather than dying or leaving the show without a trace, Ms. Krabappel will continue to exist in the Springfield fictional universe.
  
 
If our attention is currency, we must spend it wisely.
 
This column was about television shows that raised important questions. On my search for those treasures, I found trash that makes shows such as “Say Yes to the Dress” and “Gossip Girl” look like critical darlings. My favorites include: “King of Arms,” a reality series that follows the “raw and highly competitive world of American arm wrestling,” “Pomona Kings,” described as a “Romeo and Juliet drag-racing Drama,” and “Fat Girl Revenge,” a reality series that follows formerly fat women who take revenge on those who made them miserable when they were fat. For every critical darling, there are 10 shows that aim to please the lowest denominator, to copy what has already been done, and generate petty schadenfreude.
 
Networks produce television with an audience in mind, which means that all of this content was produced with beliefs about what viewers want. But that doesn’t mean that these beliefs are correct or should be rewarded with our attention. Fewer people each year pay for cable, myself included, but what we watch does influence which shows become advertiser favorites and make it beyond their premieres. The easiest way to support television that not only resembles art but also reflects us is to be selective with our time.

It’s already been called the “record of the Millenium”—by the artist herself. Without the clairvoyant abilities of a Tiresias or even a Nostradamus, one can’t vouch for that statement. But Lady Gaga’s “ARTPOP,” her third full-length album and follow-up to 2011’s global phenomenon “Born This Way,” still stands as a provocative statement on contemporary music, its social and commercial purposes, and the limits of electronic style.
Much like early comments on “ARTPOP,” most reviews of “Born This Way”—like those in Rolling Stone and The New Yorker—emphasized only its most obvious characteristics: its sonic bombast, its social and religious themes, its driving industrial dance beats that threatened to overwhelm the uninitiated. Critical outlook again and again mislabeled the effort as simply ‘dance music,’ thereby failing to understand “Born This Way,” and Lady Gaga’s oeuvre in its entirety up to that point, for what it really was: classic rock, in its many variations, embellished for mass consumption, painted over with a varnish of contemporary electronic style. “Born This Way” was a remarkable accomplishment for its astonishing variety, its vocal dynamism, its peaks and valleys, its ecstasy, its moodiness, its screams and its silences.
“ARTPOP” has already garnered similar critical assessments, but it is an altogether different animal. Since her debut “The Fame” and its later expansion “The Fame Monster,” Gaga has produced loosely related concept albums, each a coherent whole in its treatment of various musical and social themes. “The Fame Monster” was an extended rumination on seven fears that accompany pop stardom; “Born This Way” was like a single suite in 17 movements tied together by recurring church bells, Christian symbols, layers of harpsichord and organ, fashion references, lyrics in multiple languages real and invented, and an overarching arena rock aesthetic. “ARTPOP,” on the contrary, eschews this template. Its brilliance and its tragic flaw is its internal incoherence. “ARTPOP” is not a concept album, it is a collection of songs; some of them are good, many of them are great.
The record’s strongest moments are its catchiest. In each case, abrasive EDM breakdowns go hand-in-hand with soaring disco melodies. “Aura,” from the soundtrack to Robert Rodriguez’s “Machete Kills” (2013), features one of the best hooks on the record. “Venus” and “Sexxx Dreams” are as infectious as anything Gaga has released to date. “Swine” is a brilliant amalgam of dubstep and piano-based pop as beautiful as it is ruthless—Gaga’s shrieks, wails, and gurgled “oinks” accompany perhaps the most poignant and reflective song on “ARTPOP.” “Gypsy” would have fit comfortably on “Born This Way”—it is Springsteen-inspired arena rock to a T, with big choruses and bigger drums.
For those familiar with Gaga’s output, several tracks might uncannily bring to mind “The Fame” and “Born This Way.” The Wild West guitar intro of “Aura” recalls “Americano.” “Jewels n’ Drugs” featuring T.I., Too $hort, and Twista is Gaga’s first hip-hop track since “Paper Gangsta” featuring Flo Rida. The less catchy and more dance-heavy “G.U.Y.” sounds like an updated “Love Game.” The tongue-in-cheek opening lines to “Donatella” (“I’m rich, and I’m a little bit of a bitch”) have their antecedent in Gaga’s career debut single “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich.” Most significant of these career-reminiscent tracks on “ARTPOP” is “Dope,” which continues the singer’s blueprint of including one piano ballad on each record. “The Fame” included “Brown Eyes,” “The Fame Monster” had “Speechless,” and “Born This Way” featured “Yoü and I.” First performed at the iTunes Festival earlier this year as “I Wanna Be With You,” the song was completely rewritten as “Dope,” which Gaga debuted at the YouTube Music Awards in a performance directed by Spike Jonze. Gaga’s voice has never sounded better—the bluesy hoarseness of her upper range complemented by the rich darkness of her deeper alto notes. Slurred words over somber chords make “Dope” among Gaga’s most remarkable performances on record.
“ARTPOP” does have its moments of weakness. “Manicure,” along with several other tracks from the album, was first—and more successfully—performed at the 2013 iTunes Festival. After changing the song’s lyrics and reordering its sections, the recorded version of “Manicure” has been significantly weakened, its formerly propulsive drive now half-baked. “Donatella” and “Fashion!” are lively but hardly memorable. “Jewels n’ Drugs” has almost no melodic content to speak of, and it would be better served by three above-par emcees instead of the trio it has. “Mary Jane Holland,” a not-so-subtle reference to drug use, doesn’t meet the standard set by earlier songs on the record.
If “ARTPOP” lacks the overarching conceptual framework of Gaga’s previous efforts, it is yet more challenging.  While “ARTPOP” lacks the stylistic coherence and self-referential interconnectedness of “The Fame Monster” and “Born This Way,” the sonic experimentation and lyrical play—ranging freely from Gertrude Stein to kitsch, and happily so—makes it Gaga’s best and most earnest exploration of electronic dance music and its limits. It would be a mistake, once again, to label “ARTPOP” as simply ‘“dance music.” Put simply, few of these songs—with the exception of “Do What U Want” featuring R. Kelly and the instant gay club classic “Applause”—could be danced to. Gaga is particularly fond of dropping beats and basslines out of the mix as soon as she hits the chorus, as in “Sexxx Dreams” and “Aura”; the dubstep drum rolls of “Swine” are exaggerated, too long to function properly; the bridge of “Venus” is stark and subdued. Taking after one of her primary influences, J.S. Bach himself, Lady Gaga has produced a new aesthetic of stylized dance. “ARTPOP” showcases the formal elements of electronic music dance music not for their intended purposes, but rather for their own sake. There—art in pop.

"Neon Lights"
Demi Lovato, "Demi"
It’s back to living in the shadow of long time pal Selena Gomez for Demi Lovato. Her new single “Neon Lights” is nothing short of disappointing. Its lyrics sound as though they were written in an attention-starved middle school girl’s journal: “Be still my heart ’cause it’s freaking out, its freaking out, right now…. Baby when they look up at the sky / We’ll be shooting stars just passing by.” The theme is vacuous, to put it bluntly. The melody doesn’t help her case either. It follows the cookie-cutter pop song formula, with big drops and pulsating vocal crescendos, all while Demi insinuates that we may all be dead tomorrow, so we must all sleep with each other tonight. Do better, Demi.
"Royals"
Lorde, "Pure Heroine"
The New Zealand sensation Lorde has captivated millions across America with her new single “Royals.” The single has proven to be anything but just another fleeting  pop song. It has substantive lyrics, which comment on the images in hip-hop music and how the rap industry lifestyle is so far removed from her life back home: “But everybody’s like Cristal, Maybach, diamond on your timepiece…. We don’t care, we aren’t caught up in your love affair.” Lorde isn’t just interested in making catchy music—though the song has a buoyant synthesized bass line that would bring artists like M.I.A. and David Guetta to their knees—she’s interested in making music that speaks to real people’s lives.
"Banga! Banga!"
Austin Mahone, album not yet titled
Austin Mahone, who appears to be a cloned combination of Justin Bieber and Aaron Carter, recently released a new single called “Banga! Banga!” The artist is sure it will be a hit among his fans, who he refers to as his “Mahomies.” With lyrics like, “You’re a banga banga banga banga banga /  I wanna pledge a bet  / Before the night is over  / Girl, I’m gonna make it that” over an insistent, sugary synth line, the track has more than enough energy to pull people to the dancefloor. Mahone can sleep well knowing that he’s satisfactorily fulfilling his role as a teenage heartthrob.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Conspiracy” is a difficult film to watch, but this can be counted as a success for the film’s screenwriter, Loring Mandel. The film dramatizes the top-secret 1942 Wannsee Conference, where 15 Nazi officials developed the Final Solution, the Nazi plan to annihilate Europe’s Jewish population. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club will stage an adaptation of the film written by Mandel on the Loeb Mainstage opening on Friday and running through Nov. 23. The Crimson sat down with Mandel for an interview about the film and the stage adaptation.
The Harvard Crimson: “Conspiracy,” on its surface, seems like an unconventional idea for a film. There’s not much in the way of traditional “action” going on. How did the project come to be?
Loring Mandel: The original film idea came from Frank Pierson and Peter Zinner. Peter was a film editor—he edited one of “The Godfather” films. Peter was an Austrian escapee, and he knew the Wannsee story, and he told it to Pierson. They saw an old German film about it, and then they proposed it to HBO. HBO was interested; Frank had done very well for HBO with “Citizen Cohn.” Frank called me and asked me if I was interested, and he sent me material on the conference. He said that it was the first Holocaust thing that he had seen that didn’t move him to tears, but moved him to anger, and that was the reason that he thought that it should be done. And after I did the research on the material that he had sent me, I agreed, and that was in the fall of 1997.
THC: One of the most interesting things about the film is how you went about researching it. The film is largely based on a single document that survived from the conference, right?
LM: The document that survived was very highly redacted, by three different people: first by Eichmann, then by Müller, then by Heydrich himself. So all that it really contains is the cast of characters and the sequence of events, the agenda. But there’s other information—not much, but there are comments that Eichmann made when he was captured and more comments during his trial. That’s really the only hard material we have. So I spent a couple days in the archives of the Holocaust Museum finding out as much as I could about as many of the participants as I could locate in those files. I also looked at the transcripts of the Eichmann testimony. Then I did research at the Leo Baeck Institute in New York, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York, the museum in the building where the conference took place, and Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. When I had enough of a feel of the background of the participants, plus what I had gotten from the conference itself, I wrote the first draft, and that was finished in January of ’98. That was submitted to HBO, they said they wanted to proceed with it, and they hired a full-time researcher to provide supplementary material, and she was able to find out a great deal more of the background of the characters than I had been able to get. We ended up with tremendous amounts of research.
THC: One of the concerns with a film like this is that it is very easy to vilify every man at that conference in a way that is one-dimensional, but at the same time it’s not very interesting to watch a film with 15 one-dimensional villains. How were you able to shade-in the characters more fully, as people with distinct character traits and motivations? Where did the character traits come from if they were not written down in historical records?
LM: It’s possible to make certain assumptions from what you read of the background of characters…. In the last analysis, it all comes from how successful my roleplaying is, because that’s really what it is. I don’t go at it didactically. For me, the process is more like trying to become the character and then hearing what the character says and watching what the character does, and the writing is like stenography, making a record of what it is I hear and what it is I say. I can’t think of any other way to do it.
THC: Do you foresee any challenges in adapting this to the stage?
LM: The film is a one-eye process; it’s monocular. Stage is binocular, and it makes a real difference. In film, it’s easy to begin a scene in the middle of a sentence, because you can cut into it. You can’t do that on the stage because the character is there and talking before, unless you do it all with lights, and then it really isn’t an adaptation.
THC: How do you feel about “Conspiracy” being adapted by students here at Harvard?
I think it’s great. The only reason that I did a stage version of it is because I felt it was something that people should be made aware of—young people particularly. I thought it was something that schools could do, and churches and synagogues and so on. That’s why, because I never thought it was a big commercial property. So the fact that it’s been exposed here, I think that’s absolutely wonderful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past April, Daniel Pedro Mateo went missing from the small Guatemalan village of El Quetzal. His kidnappers demanded a ransom of 150,000 quetzals, about $19,000, from Mateo’s family. Nine days later, his mangled body was found near his home village of Santa Eulalia.
Mateo was an outspoken activist on behalf of his native Q’anjob’al people, a Maya group that lives in western Guatemala. In addition to campaigning against various acts of what activists termed environmental exploitation—such as a massive dam that would have displaced numerous Maya people from their homeland—Mateo’s activism also extended to preserving his native tongue. He was one of the founders of Snuq Jolom Konob, a bilingual radio station with broadcasts in both Spanish and Q’anjob’al—a subversive act in a country where indigenous languages are said to represent a threat to the hegemony of the hispanohablante.
For Annie Gagliardi, a postdoctoral fellow in Harvard’s Linguistics Department, Mateo’s death hit close to home. Much of her work focuses on languages of the Caucasus and Guatemala, and she had previously done research in Guatemala with Mateo's cousin, another linguistics postdoc at Harvard. Mateo was murdered a few weeks before Gagliardi was scheduled to return to Guatemala and meet him. “It’s a frightening pattern,” Gagliardi says. “Here are these languages you care about, these communities you care about, and the people fighting for them—they’re targets.”
For speakers of minority languages like Q’anjob’al, their language isn’t just a means of communication, but also a way to preserve their culture. For Gagliardi and other linguists at Harvard and beyond, these languages provide critical insight into the nature of language itself. Studying minority languages validates their existence, scholars say, and speaking them represents a defiant continuance of their speakers’ oral and written traditions and the unique worldview that these languages express.
POLITICAL SPEECH
Mateo’s story is just one of many in the region’s long string of violence toward cultural activists. While it is unknown why Mateo was murdered and what role his efforts to revitalize Q’anjob’al may have played, his story still speaks to the political potency minority languages can have. Speaking such languages is often an act of resistance in and of itself, and official efforts by governments and majority groups to discourage or prohibit their use is a testament to the role these languages play as strongholds against assimilation.
According to Erin D. Boon, a graduate student in the Celtic Languages and Literatures Department, Welsh is another language whose current precarious situation has much to do with politics. Welsh’s decline, Boon says had much to do with institutionalized efforts to shame its speakers. “Kids wore ‘Welsh nots’—if you were caught speaking Welsh, you had to wear this around your neck,” Boon says. The “nots,” wooden pendants often with the letters “WN” carved into them, were passed on when another student spoke Welsh; at the end of the day, the student wearing the “not” was beaten. Welsh posed a problem for proponents of Britain’s homogenization not just because they couldn’t understand the language—the simple act of speaking a non-majority language represented a rejection of English rule.
In the extreme, says Alexandre A. Tokovinine, languages have been removed from any literal meaning and repurposed to serve purely symbolic ends. Tokovinine, a lecturer in Harvard’s Anthropology Department who focuses on classic Mesoamerican languages and civilizations, teaches the undergraduate course “Anthropology 1170: Mesoamerican Writing Systems,” and he has also conducted research on the history of Mayan languages and their contemporary descendants. The ancient Mayan writing system, which comprises hundreds of hieroglyphs, has fallen out of practical use today largely due to displacement by Latin-based scripts at the hands of colonists. But classic Maya script has taken on new significance—present-day Maya cultural activists emblazon the hieroglyphs onto books and signs. These characters, Tokovinine says, serve not to convey any literal meaning but rather to symbolically subvert prevailing stereotypes of Maya people as dumb, cultureless savages. “They use [the hieroglyphs] as a symbol of this broad indigenous tradition that in many ways equals or eclipses Spanish medieval traditions,” Tokovinine says.
The political dimension of Maya script is nothing new. Five hundred years ago, according to Tokovinine, the Mayan hieroglyphic writing system posed a serious challenge to Spanish officials seeking to impose a colonial order. The script played a vital role in the rituals and transference of the Mayan religious tradition—so in 1562, Bishop Diego de Landa Calderón  burned over 40 Maya codices and spearheaded attempts to render the Mayan script using the Roman alphabet. “[The Spaniards] singled out writing as a tradition they had to eliminate because it was the main obstacle to converting natives to Christianity,” Tokovinine says. “It wasn’t enough to target the priesthood—they also had to target the books.”
WORD PROCESSING
To native speakers, minority languages represent a powerful tool of social protest. To linguists at Harvard, they represent an invaluable resource that can provide groundbreaking insight into how languages work. As professor of linguistics Maria Polinsky puts it, “Every language gives you something to test and to challenge your theory.”
Linguists’ approach is inductive rather than deductive—that is, they derive theories about what language is and how it works based on findings that are universally applicable. “[Linguists] have to whittle it down to what languages have in common to know what language is,” Boon says. If even a single language doesn’t fit with their theories, it’s a problem with the theory, not the language.
Research on minority languages benefits speakers as well as researchers. In addition to spending time in Guatemala, Gagliardi has conducted field research on Tsez, a language spoken by about 13,000 people in a conflict-torn area of the Caucasus Mountains. Though the communities in which Tsez is spoken are frequently remote and isolated mountain villages, Gagliardi has been met with warmth rather than suspicion. “It made [Tsez people] feel good that an American would go all the way there just to study their language,” she says.
Enthusiasm for Gagliardi’s research has meant a surplus of data from her experiments. “I’ve already learned about the language beforehand and designed an experiment—really, all I actually need from the participants is that they participate in my task and behave however they behave,” Gagliardi says. “But people, even adults, want to talk about their language, they want to talk to you about their sentences, and they get really interested in it—I think because you’re interested in it.”
This willingness to open up makes sense coming from communities whose language is constantly jeopardized by the encroachment of more widely spoken languages—in Tsez’s case, Russian and Avar. “By coming into these small communities and doing research on any aspect of that language, you’re essentially validating the importance of that language and giving speakers some external sign of approval,” Polinsky says. “And very often, they don’t get this validation from neighboring communities, especially in places like Guatemala and the Caucasus.”
Furthermore, minority status itself can have an influence on a language’s syntax and vocabulary, which is a point of interest for many linguists. “If you’re in a small community where everybody knows everybody, I don’t have to refer to things by name—I can refer to he, she, or it,” Polinsky says. “You find that sometimes simple things…are expressed very differently because of the tight-knit culture.”
Polinsky’s point is borne out by the experiences of Kenard G. Dillon ’17, who grew up on a Navajo reservation in Arizona. His grandfather was a World War II Navajo code talker, and though his parents do not know the language, he took it up during his primary education. He found that Navajo's geographic isolation meant that it lacked the vocabulary to describe the new ideas and technologies brought by globalization. “Because [Navajo] were all so confined to this one little corner of the southwest, we didn’t know what an ocean was, or what a whale was,” he says. Instead of wholesale borrowing of words from English to describe these new things, Navajo instead uses metaphors that reimagine everyday objects. “The word for octopus is ‘eight-arms,’ and a whale is just ‘big fish,’” Dillon says. “The word for metal is ‘besh,’ so technology is just ‘besh so-and-so’—phone is ‘metal that talks’ and a computer is ‘metal that thinks.’”
When a language dies, linguists say, it diminishes the potential for these kinds of insights, whether linguistic or cultural. “For a linguist, you lose a particular system that’s as complex as the next one,” Polinsky says. “And all that ambient culture that language creates will also get lost.”
TRANSMISSION FAILURE
Despite their precarious political position, many endangered languages are being preserved and even revived thanks to both their continual study by outside researchers and successful activism by native speakers.
Welsh is somewhat of a poster child for successful language revitalization. It’s currently spoken by about 20 percent of the population of Wales. While still a relatively small proportion, the modest growth experienced in the 21st century represents the halt of a long decline, with the percentage of Welsh speakers in Wales bottoming out in 1991 at 18.7 percent according to census data. The days of the Welsh not are over, and the Welsh language is a strong source of pride for its speakers.
But the survival of a language cannot be taken for granted—education and language transference must continue to occur if a language has any hope of survival. “One of the most effective ways of killing a language is to stop transmitting it to children,” Polinsky says.
This lack of transmission was an issue for Navajo—in the mid-1900s, students like Dillon's grandparents were discouraged from both speaking their native tongue in school and passing it on to their future children. “My grandparents on my mom’s side both went to boarding school,” Dillon says. “Boarding school meant to Americanize Native Americans—the way the language was approached was, ‘You need to speak English, and when you start families, you’re not going to teach your kids this language, because this language isn’t American.’”
However, the use of Navajo code-talkers in World War II—considered integral to the Allies’ success—renewed interest in teaching and speaking the language. Even so, Dillon’s mother, like many in her generation, does not speak any Navajo at all. It’s standard for students on the Navajo reservation to take classes in the language, but Dillon says its teaching is hampered by inconsistent curricula as well as what he describes as Arizona’s fiercely conservative political environment.
“The law says that we can’t instruct students in any language other than English,” Dillon says. “So to get past that, tribes have to classify their own languages as foreign languages so that they’re able to teach it legally.”
At the end of our interview, Dillon introduces himself to me once again, this time in Navajo. As he speaks, my Anglophone ears pick up the breathiness of French, the musicality of Mandarin, and the cadence of Arabic—but the content of what he says is uniquely Navajo.
“I said my name, and then I mentioned my clans—which really defines who you are,” Dillon says. “I mentioned my mom’s clan, my dad’s clan, my maternal grandfather’s clan, and my paternal grandfather’s clan.”
This is the standard Navajo introduction, according to Dillon, akin to the way you’d introduce yourself in English to an audience or a formal group. Dillon’s introduction illustrates the particular importance of family and history to the Navajo people. For Dillon and other speakers of minority languages, their native tongues are just as much a part of this history as the words they speak.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The opening scene of “Dallas Buyers Club” is maybe the film’s best: it finds cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) having sex with a woman in a stall at a rodeo, staring through the slats as a bull furiously bucks its helpless rider. As Woodroof climaxes, the bull hurls its rider to the ground, where he lies inert; post-coital, Woodroof looks a man defeated, not fulfilled. The wordless scene is complexly metaphorical, perfectly acted, and immersive.
 
It’s such scenes that throw into relief the disappointing aspects of “Buyers Club,” though. Director Jean-Marc Vallée shows himself capable of remarkable filmmaking, guided by subtle and striking writing from Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, so it’s frustrating when that inspired storytelling is occasionally replaced by bland exposition. “Dallas Buyers Club” is a wonderfully complete historical drama and a great film, but it struggles with some lazy stylistic choices and dull scenes.
 
The film presents a detailed look at Woodroof’s battle with HIV and AIDS, situating his true story deftly within gay culture and the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. Woodroof, a straight and homophobic Texas electrician, was diagnosed around 1986 and not approved for trials of a Big Pharma drug called AZT. He was inspired by similar organizations nationwide to form the Dallas Buyers Club, where AIDS sufferers could purchase illegally smuggled and non-FDA-approved natural remedies, resulting in a clash with the FDA. Borten and Wallack’s script—originally written by Borten in 1992 after an interview with a dying Woodroof and bounced around Hollywood for 20 years—balances an admirable breadth of documentary details, from the discrimination against Woodroof as a straight AIDS sufferer to his smuggling schemes, legal battle with the FDA, and research into AZT’s potentially harmful effects. 
 
But the film’s best story is Borten and Wallack’s own creation: a friendship between Woodroof and a transgender woman named Rayon (Jared Leto), which demonstrates Woodroof’s real-life transformation from homophobe to sympathetic advocate. The two develop a wonderfully multifaceted relationship. They’re savvy business partners who build a clientele and manage the Club’s booming finances; squabbling at the supermarket over whether to buy potato chips, they’re more like a married couple.
 
They become close friends whose humorous indications of mutual acceptance are one of the film’s delights—Rayon secretly adds a portrait of Marc Bolan to Ron’s masturbation fantasy wall, to the other’s eventual surprise, and Woodroof, noticing Rayon gazing enviously at a waitress’s breasts, jokes, “You’re starting to look normal.” This multidimensionality transcends typical unlikely-friendship narratives, and their bond is the film’s heart and spark.
 
McConaughey and Leto give impressive performances as the duo. McConaughey’s has peaks and valleys—he sticks to his laconic Texas drawl for many scenes, but he wows in desperate moments. When Woodroof hears his diagnosis, his expression dances almost imperceptibly between terrified and fiercely combative. McConaughey also masters the conflicting tones of Borten and Wallack’s best writing, like when he tells his doctor Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), “Screw the FDA; I’m gon’ be DOA” as his eyes brim with tears.
 
Leto, conversely, is blessed with a role that demands a complete transformation of speaking style and manner, and he vanishes into Rayon. The stars both underwent amazing body alterations, McConaughey gaunt and loping like Christian Bale in “The Fighter” and Leto—who is no stranger to body remodeling, having gained and lost 60 pounds to play John Lennon’s killer in “Chapter 27”—trimmer by another 30 and decked in gaudy mascara. His achievement is the emphases, pursed lips, and flicks of the wrist that create a seamless character.
 
Their dynamic is captivating, as are the sequences where Vallée and cinematographer Yves Bélanger realize Borten and Wallack’s clever visual storytelling. In one of the best of these, Woodruff prays fervently for God to “show me a fuckin’ sign” as red light flickers on his face from what seem to be church altar candles—until the camera retracts to reveal the neon glow reflected off the bar at a strip club. Ron downs his drink, his desperation and wild lifestyle perfectly captured.
 
The historical exposition is often tautly realistic—but the scenes where it lags are the film’s only real flaw. The problem is not that these scenes are plainly written and shot, for the film’s balance of realism and more stylized storytelling is well struck—the film remembers the historical veracity of its events by not overdoing its cinematic flourishes. The shortfall is that these scenes are sometimes repetitive and poorly motivated. The first act in particular stumbles through too many sequences of Woodroof fainting, snorting cocaine and drinking, and discussing the specifics of his disease with Dr. Saks.
 
These scenes are few and far between—they are minor setbacks in an admirably told underdog story. “Dallas Buyers Club” happens to be an underdog story in itself: Vallée had mostly worked outside the U.S., McConaughey signed on before becoming the rising dramatic powerhouse of “Killer Joe” and “Mud,” the chameleonic Leto’s last wide release was in 2005, and Borten became renowned for writing the longest-languishing script in Hollywood. In Woodroof’s case and the film’s, it’s thrilling to see such chances succeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the surface, it might seem that Harvard, with a $32.7 billion endowment, should never have to worry about financial constraints. However, the actual situation is more nuanced.  Significant fluctuations can occur in financial performance—including an $8 billion loss in 2009—that make the endowment more volatile and less freely dispensable than its listed amount might indicate. And as this year’s financial report showed, operating expenses are a sizeable $4.2 billion, with Harvard running a $34 million operating deficit and $5.7 billion in total debt. Harvard, like most other universities, is clearly still recovering from the recent financial crisis.
As such, Harvard may need to make more budget cuts in the future; the University has already been forced to make painful layoffs and enact less difficult but still tangible reductions such as ending hot breakfast in the Houses. But given the uncertainties of University finances, it is even more starkly clear that dependable federal funding of basic research—and the valuable contributions that come with it—is necessary and critically important.
After all, in a time of economic downturn, universities will find it much more difficult to provide sufficient money for research.  As such, academics must then rely more on the public sector to maintain a stable stream of funding.  Unfortunately, at the same time that higher education is struggling financially, the federal government has enacted a set of extensive budget cuts, known as the sequester, that took effect in March. This includes major cuts to federal funding of basic research that Harvard researchers depend upon heavily to finance their work.
Certainly, Harvard, as a leading academic institution, should prioritize protection of basic research. However, currently Harvard may not have the financial ability to sustain the same levels of funding as before or match the amount of former government grants. As such, researchers will be unable to fund as many projects and hire as much staff; in particular, young, promising academics are shut out. Consequently, without other external parties willing to provide money, basic research will suffer over time. As University President Drew G. Faust said, this is “a self-inflicted wound on [the U.S.’s] intellectual and human capital.”
This issue goes far beyond Harvard—in fact, Harvard is one of the most fortunate universities in this crunch since it has a large amount of resources and clout with which to support its research interests. Other institutions may not be so lucky. Without consistent and meaningful federal funding, American university research will be left in limbo, vulnerable to the instability of financial currents. But the future of U.S. academic research—the future of American intellectual contributions to the world—is too important to risk.

To: Confused Sophomore
From: Still Confused Junior
This Wednesday is the date for Harvard sophomores to declare their concentrations once and for all. Will it be computer science or classics? Slavic languages or economics? Or maybe one of five different options in biology? It’s time, my sophomore friends, to concentrate.
When I noticed that this milestone for the Class of 2016 was approaching, I couldn’t help but reflect on the meaning of this decision. At this time one year ago, I was walking out of yet another meeting with yet another concentration advisor—this was the 10th department I had checked out. And no, I still hadn’t the faintest idea what I was going to declare.
With great volatility, as the November deadline neared, I oscillated. One week I’d tell everyone I knew that I was going to be history of science. The next week I had to explain that when I’d said history of science, I’d actually meant sociology. I mean, neurobiology. Nope, social studies. Did I say that? You must have heard wrong. I’m going to be environmental science and public policy. The exclamation points in my mom’s texts dwindled—“COOL!!!!!!!!” became “cool!!!” which faded to “cool.” and then, “…are you serious?”
I could not concentrate.
In the end, I did choose. I thought about not choosing, but writing a fifty-dollar check to the Registrar’s Office sounded worse than declaring the wrong concentration. I wish I could say that after I chose, I realized that the decision was not so prodigious, my future was not being fated, and that I never thought about it again. That would be a lie, though. It turns out that changing concentrations is not so difficult, which sounds like a good thing, but if you’re like me, really it’s not. It means you can keep thinking about it. Meeting with concentration advisors. Oscillating.
In the months following my much discussed concentration decision and even today, every time that I feel myself becoming excited about a topic or class outside of my declared field of study, my stomach turns. “Focus,” I tell myself… “Concentrate!” I decide that the new passions I feel are insincere, or else I must have chosen wrong.
We are told though, that we cannot choose wrong. We can concentrate in anything and still do anything. In fact, we can’t possibly decide what to do with our lives, for we do not know what the world will be like in two weeks, let alone in 30 years. Some of the most desired jobs—such as working for titans like Facebook and Google—did not exist even a decade ago, which means our education is preparing us to do things we’ve never heard of. But still, ever-changing interests do not make an ever-changing world more navigable. It makes it confusing. Hard to concentrate.
I am literally the last person qualified to be giving advice on choosing a concentration. I have not finished oscillating. My mom’s responses to the texts that come every few months proclaiming the new concentration that I swear I’m going to switch to has evolved to a simple “?” or else she forgets to respond.
If I, a still confused junior, have any advice at all to offer to my sophomore peers, it is this: Embrace changing interests and new passions, but do not fear concentration. In making a choice this Wednesday, Harvard does not task you with consolidating your life’s passion and your entire essence into a department. No one makes you pledge to stop adventuring or experimenting, wandering or wondering. One of the greatest things about being here in college is that we have so many other outlets to explore and express our interests, be it through theater, music, activism, community service, athletics, research, travel, or just strange and interesting conversations with the people around us.
What I have learned from my multi-year struggle to decisively remain loyal to one field of study is that our concentrations need not capture every facet of our interests. If what you decide to submit to the Registrar on Wednesday reflects even one part of your interests, you’ve done right. But you cannot let that discourage you from finding and embracing other interests. You can still be an astronaut and a cowgirl and a mad scientist and the president. We shouldn’t fear concentration because we don’t have to concentrate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a special election on October 16, New Jersey residents chose Democrat Cory Booker to fill the seat of the late Senator Frank Lautenberg. This result was highly anticipated. What’s more interesting is that his opponent, former mayor of Bogota Steve Lonegan—a Tea Party Republican—won a full 44 percent of the vote. In a Democratic state frustrated by the recent government shutdown, Lonegan’s strong showing was surprising.
The endorsements Lonegan placed most prominently on his website included those of Sarah Palin, Rick Perry, and Rand Paul, all politicians who are much farther to the right than most politicians in New Jersey. The state has not elected a Republican senator since 1972 and has not had a majority vote for a Republican president since 1988. While recently re-elected Governor Chris Christie is a Republican, he is seen as far more moderate than any of the aforementioned figures.
Moreover, the vast majority of New Jersey residents disagree with Lonegan on important matters of policy. For instance, residents’ support for the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) is higher than the national average. Recently, New Jerseyans came out strongly in favor of the legalization of gay marriage in the state. Lonegan stood firmly against popular opinion on both of these issues: In his campaign, he said that he supports the full repeal of the ACA and believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman. These issues are critical and particularly relevant. Coupled with the recent fiasco in Congress, they should have spelled disaster for Lonegan’s campaign.
Why, then, did so many New Jersey voters support Lonegan?
Critics of the electoral system might argue that the population was uninformed, but this claim seems to be unfounded. First, senator-elect Cory Booker’s role as mayor of Newark meant that he was widely recognized and that his positions were relatively clear. Lonegan, too, was open and direct about his opinions.
Others might try to explain Lonegan’s success by saying that New Jersey is suddenly leaning toward the right. But New Jersey currently has almost 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, reflecting the leftward lean of the state population. Moreover, there is little love among the residents of the state for most Republicans, whom they blame for the recent government shutdown.
A few possible explanations remain. The first is that people were simply unhappy with Cory Booker and chose the alternative. While this is possible, voting for a candidate whose position is so much at odds with one’s own seems both risky and unlikely. Given that 44 percent of New Jersey residents do not belong to the Tea Party, Lonegan’s position must have been at odds with those of most voters.
As such, Lonegan’s impressive showing appears to be the result, quite simply, of a problem with getting out the vote. Cory Booker was the predicted favorite—so much so, perhaps, that many people did not bother to cast their ballots. Indeed, only around 24 percent of residents did vote. I know many Jersey residents who missed filing the necessary paperwork or made plans for that day, certain of a victory.
While Cory Booker did ultimately win, the smaller–than-expected victory margin should serve as a lesson: The predicted victor may not always easily succeed. Instead, it is critical, especially in smaller elections, for the candidates work to convince people to vote. If a sufficient number of citizens decide that the election’s result is a foregone conclusion, they just might find that they’re mistaken.
This free rider problem reared its head again in this week’s gubernatorial election. Luckily for Christie enthusiasts who took this gamble—most eligible voters did not actually vote—the incumbent and forecasted winner did triumph.
But exit surveys from Election Day reveal some interesting things about New Jersey state politics: While Christie won just over 60 percent of the vote, his victory did not translate into resounding support for the GOP or a personal presidential run in 2016. Indeed, 57 percent of those who voted had an unfavorable opinion of the GOP and viewed both the Democrats and President Obama in a positive light. Only 51 percent believed that Christie would make a good president; more said they’d vote for Hillary Clinton were she to run against Christie in 2016.
These numbers illustrate an additional lesson: There’s a distinction between statewide and national political ideology. The economy and taxes are the two most critical issues for Jersey residents when they’re concerned with their own backyards. But voting on a national level often prompts people to choose the candidates whose platforms they believe in on an ideological level. This is why Jersey has a Republican governor and Democratic senators.
If any New Jersey politician is to run for president—Christie in 2016 and Booker, perhaps, in the future—he or she will have to recognize this distinction. State “support”—sometimes, it seems, the result of the majority’s apathy—does not directly translate into national support. At the national level, candidates must be ideological leaders, and must espouse the broader beliefs that Jersey residents hold dear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My freshman year, I spent a couple of afternoons tabling at the Occupy Harvard tents, explaining some of our aims and qualms to passersby. Some students seemed vaguely interested, and others hurried past, seeming nervous about interacting with such a controversial group. But I was struck by the number of students who stopped by to tell us that we were impractical and irrational, fighting for something that would mess up the way the economic system was supposed to work. Who took time out of their day to fervently defend the status quo rather than consider the stories we had to share, or the relative smallness of the concessions for workers for which we were advocating. And for every student who told us of their opposition outright at those tables, I have encountered many, many more over the past couple of years who have expressed the same sort of disapproval of resistance on a more general scale.
This mindset, and this clash between activism and popular opinion, did not end with Occupy. Divest Harvard has been waging a powerful campaign to get Harvard to divest from fossil fuels, and though a significant majority of students voted in favor of divestment in a ballot referendum last year, The Crimson Staff lauded Drew Faust’s recent statement against divestment, as did an alarming number of my Facebook friends. The Crimson also published an editorial along similar lines about recent protests at Brown, suggesting that student activists who protested Ray Kelly were doing something reprehensible, and should have “engaged with him” rather than disrupting his talk.
I agree with The Crimson Staff that we, as students, should be listening to one another and fostering dialogue about contentious issues. But I do not agree with the way that The Crimson Staff seems to conceive of mutual listening. Mutual listening necessitates balanced scales: you cannot have a productive conversation if one voice holds an inordinate amount of power and social legitimacy over the other. Though the Staff seems to agree with this point, they misattribute the higher amount of power to the protestors. But as Neil Peterman and Sarah Benckart pointed out in their excellent letter to the editor, people in power are consistently given a platform for their points of view and are constantly listened to, while the people who they disempower are constantly deprived of a voice. Thus, in order to make up for this gulf between their power and the power of those who control them, the disempowered are generally forced to respond with more force than the situation seems to occasion to onlookers.
The influence of people in power is, by nature, invisible. We have so normalized the systems that accord these people power (capitalism, racism, militarism, imperialism) that we rarely can recognize the extremity, and the incredible violence, of their outcomes. But a protest is loud, and messy, and visible. It’s a spectacle, and through it we can see, hear, and otherwise physically experience power being exercised. And because the systems it fights against are—on the other hand—calm, polished, and regarded as rational and natural, it is hard to comprehend that they are actually the ones doing the silencing.
Our attachment to our existing social systems is a deep one. As exemplified by the American public’s fixation on whether Edward Snowden’s actions were legal (instead of whether they contributed to the greater good), often what seems to matter to us is not whether something is terrible or immoral, but whether it can be read as legal within the bounds of existing legislation. Beyond its use as a system of punishment for violations, we seem to have an attachment to the legal system as a fundamental legitimizer of our actions. And as seen in the popular reception of the Occupy movement, America is often uncomfortable with resistance to unfair laws.
This pattern extends into the way we interact with institutions in general. We do not stop to question the systems within which we function, and we learn to accept their rules, and the ways that they dole out power, as essential sources of legitimacy.
So what consequences does this have for change-making? We live in a world where idealism is routinely denigrated for being useless and unproductive. It does not produce practical or concrete results, etcetera. But it is the small, day-to-day concessions to “pragmatism” that gradually bring about our complicity with systems of violence, and routinely cause us to dismiss any possibility of change.
Radical actions of the sort that we saw in Occupy and at Brown, and radical, idealist aims of the sort that Divest Harvard is advancing, are not useless, or bad, or silencing. They challenge power at its roots, and thus force us to be uncomfortable, in a productive way, to realize that the things that we accept as fundamental to our everyday functioning might actually hinder progress toward concrete change. They are the rare events that, through resistance, manage to exist outside of the systems that restrain us, and thus serve as glimpses of a freer and more just world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After being roped off for over two years, the weathered statue Omphalos in the pedestrian peninsula by the Harvard Square T stop will be relocated to Rockport, Mass. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which owns the statue created by the late Harvard professor Dimitri Hadzi in the 1980s, had originally planned to tear it down due to structural damage and the high cost of repairs.
The MBTA will now give ownership of the statue to housing developer Michael J. Rauseo ’86, who will move it to Pigeon Cove, a public park about an hour away from Harvard. Rauseo said that he thought Rockport would be a fitting home for Omphalos because the statue is made of many kinds of granite, and the city was a former granite quarry.
Cynthia Hadzi, Dimitri’s widow, said that she was relieved that the statue will remain in Massachusetts and close to Harvard Square.
“To be honest, I couldn’t believe it to be real when this person called and said he wanted this statue as a landmark for the park,” she said.
According to Cynthia, the MBTA had given her a waiver that allowed her several weeks to try to raise $500,000 to repair the statue. She said that when Rauseo called her, the waiver was due to expire in about a week, after which the MBTA would have been able to tear down Omphalos.
Visual and Environmental Studies professor Alfred Guzzetti ’64 said that while he thought the ideal solution would have been to keep the statue in Harvard Square, he considered the transfer to be a “happy ending” for Omphalos.
Guzzetti, who worked with Dimitri while he was at Harvard, said that the name of the statue was specifically tied to its current location. Omphalos meant “navel of the world,” and, according to Guzzetti, Dimitri saw Harvard as the center of the world.
“It’s meant to be in Harvard Square because of its name,” Guzzetti said.
According to an article in the Boston Globe, other options for saving the Omphalos included moving it to Virginia.
Cynthia said that although she received support from Harvard students and alumni—some of whom had helped to build Omphalos in the 1980s—she was disappointed that the University did not step in to preserve the statue.
“Given it can’t stay where it is, I think this is a good solution,” Cynthia said, adding that she and her husband used to visit Rockport and knew the area well.
Hadzi said that she is happy that the statue will continue to remain accessible to the public.
“It’s said to be the only public structure in the park in Pigeon Cove,” she said. “It can stand there like a beacon.”

Fifty-seven million children around the world do not go to school, but youth advocacy can play an important role in reversing this trend, according to Chernor Bah, youth representative to the United Nations High Level Steering Committee.
Bah, who is also chair of the Youth Advocacy Group for the Global Education First Initiative, spoke to a small group of students Monday night in an event sponsored by the Leadership Institute at Harvard College. He emphasized that education is a “simple human right,” but lamented statistics such as the 96 percent of children with disabilities in Africa who do not receive an education.
“That’s a crisis,” Bah said. “It should call our attention.”
Bah said that youth have much potential to accomplish global change and lead movements for education. He expressed deep respect for Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani education activist whom Bah called an icon in the global education movement. Malala recently received the Harvard Humanitarian of the Year award.
“I think her story reminds us of what we are capable of doing,” he said, referencing Malala’s recovery and continued activism on behalf of universal education despite being targeted by the Taliban for her work
“When Malala was shot, it could have easily become a story about the Taliban and terrorism,” Bah said. Yet, her persistence ultimately created the “perfect opportunity not to make this about terrorism, but about what she really stood for--children’s education,” he said.
Bah suggested that online platforms could support the global education movement. As an example, he referenced the efforts made on social media to highlight Malala’s cause after she was shot by the Taliban, such as the promotion of her blog posts on education and the trending of her name on Twitter.
“Sometimes we think impressions online don’t matter, but they do. We try to organize people,” he said.
Born during civil war in Sierra Leone, Bah said he would not be where he is today if he had not received an education. “The way out of poverty, hopelessness, is education,” he said. “[Education] gives hope.”
He added that his life-long goal to “give young people a voice” emerged from the chaos of the war. “That’s defined my life,” he said. “It’s always about looking for an opportunity to bring people who will be affected into the policy process.”
Youth must spread awareness because governments often need to be pushed to prioritize education when its immediate economic impact is not clear, according to Bah.
“I thought it was really interesting, and it emphasized the pressure that we as students can impart on powerful countries to make the changes that we want to see happen,” said YingYing Shang ’17 of the talk.

Featuring renowned chef and molecular gastronomer Wylie Dufresne and culinary consultant Ted Russin, this week’s “Science and Cooking” lecture focused on the culinary benefits of the meat-binding enzyme known in the restaurant industry as ‘meat glue.’
Entitled "Catalytic Conversion: Enzymes in the Kitchen,” Monday’s lecture was the 10th in the series, which parallels Harvard’s popular General Education course, Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science.”
The event’s two guest lecturers discussed how they employ the chemistry underlying enzymes and amino acids in creating innovative food.
Keeping with the overall theme of the series, Dufresne and Russin’s lecture offered insight into how principles of chemistry, biology, and physics can illuminate the art of cuisine.
Dufresne, who heads the progressive restaurant wd~50 in New York City, emphasized the connection between science and the culinary arts, noting that in order to truly understand cooking, the culinary world must turn to science.
“We’re going to have to go outside of our discipline,” he said. “We’re going to have to leave the kitchen and talk to other people and get some of these answers.”
Russin and Dufresne specifically discussed the enzyme transglutaminase, the technical name for meat glue, and how it is used in such novel dishes from wd~50’s menu as casing-less sausage and shrimp spaghetti.
Dufresne said that meat glue has become integral to the menu and popularity of his restaurant. The molecular gastronomist noted that many of the popular dishes that have drawn attention to his restaurant are only made possible by the ability of the enzyme to seamlessly bind together the proteins found in meat.
Addressing the criticism that a focus on cooking’s scientific basis might detract from the soul and artistry of culinary creation, Dufresne said his methods only add to the spirit of cooking.
“It’s important to realize that we’ve only added to the depth and knowledge that the cook can have—because there can never really be a right or wrong way to cook anything,” he said. “There will, however, be a more- or less-informed way to cook something.”
Timothy R. Mooney, a Harvard Business School student, agreed with Dufresne’s framing.
“When I cook, I like to understand what exactly is happening and how it works,” Mooney said. “I think that by understanding the processes you are better able to innovate and improvise and come up with something that nobody has done before.”

As Cambridge awaits the final results of last week’s City Council election, multiple rounds of vote tabulation have steadily narrowed the margin between the nine leading candidates and the rest of the field. Yet, even before the vote count is announced on Friday, some candidates are already considering a recount.
Minka Y. vanBeuzekom is one of those candidates. The one-term councillor was ousted by a slim margin during the preliminary round of vote tabulation on Tuesday.
“If the result stays as close as it is now, I would be crazy not to [demand a recount],” vanBeuzekom said.
On Wednesday, the Cambridge Election Commission hand-counted the city’s “auxiliary votes”—ballots that had not been read by the Scantron machines that conduct the preliminary round of vote tabulation. As of the latest count, only six votes separate vanBeuzekom from Nadeem A. Mazen, who is poised to assume the last open seat on the Council as long as his tentative ninth place finish holds.
But before the candidates can seriously contemplate a recount, they must first wait for the final results to be announced on Friday.
“It’s not clear right now,” she said. “With the provisional, yes, I’m losing, but anything could happen.”
In addition to the remaining provisional ballots, vanBeuzekom said that there are 22 overseas ballots that have yet to be added to the final tally. With fewer than two dozen votes separating many of the contenders, the uncounted ballots could alter which nine councilors emerge victorious on Friday.
Although Mazen said vanBeuzekom might pick up a couple more number one votes, Mazen remained confident that he would clinch a spot on the Council after the final count is announced Friday.
“I’m the preliminary victor and unofficial victor,” Mazen said. “On Friday, I’ll be certified.”
According to Mazen, confusion over the complex voting procedures for the City of Cambridge may have left some voters filling out ballots incorrectly.
“I do believe that we lost votes from incorrectly filled out ballots,” Mazen said.
Cambridge operates on a proportional voting system in which voters can rank the candidates in order of preference. To get elected to the Cambridge City Council, a candidate needs to reach a set quota of votes at any point in the many rounds of ballot counting. When candidates reach the necessary quota, any excess votes in their stack are redistributed to whoever is ranked next on those ballots. If a candidate is the lowest vote-holder following a given round of counting, he or she is defeated and the ballots in his or her stack are redistributed to the candidate ranked next on those ballots. This process continues until nine councillors are elected.
Five candidates—Leland Cheung, David P. Maher, Dennis A. Benzan, Timothy Toomey, Jr., E. Denise Simmons—have already reached the prerequisite number of votes needed for an uncontested election.
Marc C. McGovern, Craig A. Kelley, Dennis J. Carlone, and Mazen round out the nine front-runners, but their spots are not guaranteed. Candidates Kelley, Carlone, Mazen, and vanBeuzekom still remain within 20 votes of each other.
Now all they can do is wait.
“It’s a nail-biter,” vanBeuzekom said.

The Japanese army killed around 10,000 Chinese civilians, Russians, and American prisoners of war while testing biological weaponry during World War II, but the U.S. government withheld knowledge of the fatal tests. Even though the episode has often been overshadowed, it played a significant role in America’s ethical history, according to professor David S. Jones ’97 at the Ethics of Human Experimentation, a discussion hosted by the Harvard Undergraduate Bioethics Society Monday night.
Jones,  the A. Bernard Ackerman Professor of the Culture of Medicine, began the discussion by asking about 20 attendees to list “notorious” examples of human experimentation in the 20th century. One student brought up the Milgram experiment, in which researchers studied subjects’ willingness to obey authority figures despite morally-suspect commands. Another noted the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which the U.S. government investigated syphilis by leading a subject group of African American men to falsely believe they were receiving free government treatment for the disease.
Few students were familiar with Japan’s fatal tests even though they caused far more casualties than the other studies mentioned.
Gus G. Ruchman ‘15, co-president of the Bioethics Society, speculated during the discussion that Americans did not focus on Japan’s experiments because they were sympathetic following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
“A number of the Japanese [war crimes] haven’t figured prominently into certain textbooks because there was such a politically charged idea surrounding the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,” Ruchman said.
According to Jones, however, the U.S. government actively suppressed publicity of Japan’s tests in order to benefit from the experimentation. By offering Japanese scientists bribes and amnesty from capital punishment for their war crimes, the U.S. convinced them to share their findings.
To illustrate that American decision makers dismissed the ethical ambiguity of their involvement, Jones quoted R. M. Cheseldine, a U.S. colonel during World War II. Cheseldine conceded at the time that American bribes might eventually reflect poorly on the government but argued that the potential knowledge was worth the “risk of subsequent embarrassment.”
Jones said that discussions like the one hosted by the Bioethics Society are important because conditions still exist--such as lingering racial inequalities, mechanisms of secrecy, and concerns for national security--under which the U.S. government might be willing to overlook human rights violations.
“We have learned exactly the situations under which transgressions take place and we allow those situations,” Jones said. “I think it’s very important to broaden the bioethical discussion to include people in historical fields,” he added later.

With a Columbia quarterback, wide receiver, and linebacker sitting at the postgame press conference following Harvard’s 34-0 trouncing of the Lions, a reporter asked about the elephant in the room.
“Is playing the game still fun for you guys anymore?"
After a long silence, quarterback Trevor McDonagh answered unconvincingly, “Yeah, it’s still fun.” But then he followed it with, “When you play the sport of football, you don’t have a choice.”
On Saturday, Columbia didn’t have a choice. Despite being the home team, the Lions football players were also on team buses to travel all the way across Manhattan to the Columbia Athletic Complex to face Harvard.
The question wasn’t who would win, but by how much. Last year, after Harvard put up 69 points against Columbia, setting the mark for the most points a Crimson team has scored against the Lions, Columbia coach Pete Mangurian claimed, “we won’t lose 69 to nothing next year.”
He did keep his promise—the Lions cut that margin in half this year, allowing only 34 points. In fact, this may have been a defensive win for Columbia, which had over the previous two weeks given up 53 and 56 points to Dartmouth and Yale, respectively.
But the relatively low score doesn’t tell the whole story. Even a devoted Harvard football fan might not recognize some of the names on the box score—running backs Bo Ellis and Tyler Caveness, wide receivers Scott Miller and John Van Allen, quarterback Tanner Wrisley.
Ellis shouldered the rushing game this week—the same freshman back who last week, in his first collegiate action, made the rookie mistake of not falling on top of a dropped sideways pass that led to seven Dartmouth points. This week, Murphy retired Paul Stanton after the starter carried the ball three times—one was a 54-yard scamper, one a touchdown run to put Harvard up 14-0 in the first quarter. The freshman came in and tallied 53 yards on 14 carries.
Caveness, a senior who last saw playing time in 2011 against Bucknell, came in for Casten in Harvard’s final drive and ran for his first collegiate touchdown in the waning moments of the game to push the Crimson’s lead out to 34.
Miller, likely the seventh receiver on a healthy Crimson team’s depth chart, expanded from his usual role of punt returner and became Harvard’s second leading receiver on the day with five catches for 56 yards.
Van Allen and Wrisley, who both made their collegiate debuts on Saturday, had limited action in the game—Van Allen caught just one pass during the Crimson’s last drive, while Wrisley was put into the game for just the final kneel down, but their brief presence in the game was telling. This contest wasn’t a football game worthy of Harvard’s A team, but rather was an opportunity for some players usually on the Crimson’s practice squad to get game-timef experience.
But Mangurian doesn’t have the same luxury as Harvard coach Tim Murphy of deciding when to put inexperienced players in.  The entire Lions starting corp is littered with inexperienced underclassmen, due to losing more experienced starters to injury or maybe and more probably, lack of interest in playing for a team that requires a 20-minute bus commute to practice.
Highly touted Stanford transfer quarterback Brett Nottingham went down with an injury in the first game of the season, so Mangurian went to freshman quarterback Kelly Hilinski, who joined four other rookies on the Columbia offense.
Midway through the first quarter, Mangurian pulled Hilinski in favor of sophomore McDonagh, but to no avail. McDonagh put together some drives for Columbia, even getting the Lions into Harvard’s red zone at the end of the first half.
On that drive, the first drive of the game that looked like it wouldn’t end in a punt, Columbia was forced to go for a 4th and 2 because of lack of confidence in a kicker who was 1-for-3 on the year with a long of 23 yards. McDonagh’s pass hit the ground, and it was Harvard ball again.
It isn’t hard to see why Columbia players might be disheartened at this point in the season. The Lions are now 0-8 (0-5 in Ivy play) and have lost its last three Ancient Eight games by a combined 131 points.
But perhaps there’s a reason for Columbia to rejoice. The last time that Columbia won a game was against Cornell last year. Next week, the Lions take on the Big Red again in a battle between the two winless teams of the league.
Maybe next Saturday, Columbia will put points on the scoreboard. And maybe, the Lions may even win a game. And maybe then, McDonagh and company will finally be able to have some fun on the field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After opening its season victorious under the bright lights of TD Garden, the Harvard men’s basketball team will return home to Lavietes Pavillion on Tuesday night.
Playing at Harvard for the first time since last spring, the Crimson (1-0) will look to build on Sunday night’s 82-72 win over Holy Cross in the Coaches vs. Cancer Tripleheader when it welcomes crosstown rival MIT (0-0) in its annual exhibition game.
The Engineers are a perennial threat in the division III NEWMAC conference. After making it to the final four in the 2012 NCAA Tournament, the Engineers fell early last season. MIT lost out on the conference title but made the tournament for its fifth consecutive year. A first round loss at the hands of Saint Mary’s College of Maryland cut the season short.
Though Harvard has won the last 10 matchups between the two teams, the Engineers played the Crimson too close for comfort last year. MIT opened the contest on a 10-0 run as Harvard’s defense faltered early in the game. Playing together for the first time, the Crimson struggled to contain guard Mitchell Kates ‘13—the team’s leading scorer—who outpaced either offense with 12 points in the first half and 20 on the night.
But as Harvard found its feet, talent overcame inexperience. A dunk by junior forward Jonah Travis started off his 14-point night, and he rode the momentum on the Crimson’s next possession to bring Harvard within four on a layup in the paint. With 10 minutes to play in the first half, junior wing Wesley Saunders connected on a fast break runner to tie it up at 12 and never looked back, opening up a 15 point lead by the final buzzer.
The Engineers have since graduated its 2012-13 stars—Kates and forward Will Tashman—and will rely on a young team with only two senior members. Of the top five scorers last season, only two will return. Sophomore guard Matt Redfield started all 26 games last season and racked up 10.3 points per game. The Engineers will also look to sophomore forward Justin Pedley, a sharpshooting perimeter threat who compiled a team-high 42 percent three-point mark and 8.2 points per game.
For Harvard, last year’s lack of experience has become an abundance. After taking a yearlong leave of absence last fall, seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry will play on their home court for the first time since 2012. In their debut on Sunday, Casey struggled with foul trouble early in the game and fouled out early in the second half with four points. Curry joined sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers in the backcourt and took the primary ball handling responsibility early in the game. He finished the night with three steals and 14 points.
“[Casey and Curry] have done an amazing job of fitting in, and that's so impressive out of two guys who have played a lot for this program and been a big part of its success,” said Crimson coach Tommy Amaker, following Sunday’s win. “Certainly coming back they have been very wise and mature to understand how to fit in and not think about taking over. That has endeared them to their teammates. Kyle got in foul trouble but you can see how Brandyn played, and I am confident in those two doing sensational things for us this season.”
In its season opener against the Crusaders, Harvard relied on a balanced offensive output to overcome an early deficit. Travis chipped in a career-high 20 points in his third career double-double. Five Crimson players scored in double digits, including Saunders—last year’s leading scorer with 16.2 points per game—who backed Travis with 18.
Chambers and Curry played together for the first time and both dished out six assists. After losing Curry last year, Chambers—then a freshman—rose to the occasion and was the driving force behind Harvard’s offense with a league leading 5.7 assists per game and 37.8 minutes per game. Now Chambers can afford to take a step back.
“[Curry and Chambers] really complement each other really well, and to have more ball handlers who can relieve pressure and make plays for everyone is a luxury,” Saunders said. “They are the driving force behind the team, the two-headed monster that makes us go, and we have to try and keep up with them.”
Though Harvard is the heavy favorite in Tuesday night’s matchup, all eyes will be on Cambridge as the Crimson looks to solidify its presence on the national stage early in the season. The Harvard has received votes in the AP Top 25 and the USA Today Coaches Poll but has yet to crack the standings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final game of the Harvard women’s field hockey team’s regular season play, sophomore Elizabeth Jacobson led the Crimson to its first victory against Columbia since 2007 with both of the team’s goals in the 2-1 win.
In the team’s 2012 finale against the Lions, Harvard ended its season with a 3-2 loss, in which Jacobson had an assist.
“[Last year] we were sad to lose in the last game of our season,” Jacobson said. “We thought we could have done a lot better. This year we definitely improved not just in the Columbia game but in the whole season,”
This year, after a first half goal by Lion Lauren Skudalski, the Crimson’s season again looked all but over. Columbia (6-11, 2-5 Ivy) was up 1-0 and had dominated play for the majority of the match. Harvard (8-9, 2-5) trailed in number of penalty corners 14-6 and shots 14-13.
“We were a little slow in the beginning, which seems to be a common theme of this year, but we picked it up in the second half.” Jacobson said. “We all wanted our seniors to end the season with a great game, so we played for them.”
Even with the slow start, the Crimson generated a few good scoring chances. As the game progressed, Jacobson capitalized on these opportunities.
“We did not finish on some good opportunities,” coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “Fortunately, our persistence paid off with a late goal while being a man down which took us into overtime.”
The sophomore received a well-placed pass from junior Catriona McDonald in the 64th minute of play. Jacobson found the back of the net using the familiar reverse chip shot that led the team to victory last weekend against Vermont.
“[Elizabeth] has a great reverse touch, which she demonstrated on the first goal,” van Herwaarden said. “She played a huge role for us in Sunday’s game.”
Jacobson’s late goal was the last of regulation time. The teams faced off in an overtime battle. Just two minutes into extra-time, Freshmen Marissa Belleza, faked a shot in a 3-on-1 advantage. Belleza made the easy pass to an open Jacobson., who deflected the ball home.
Jacobson’s two goals on the day tied her for second most of the season (six). She is tied with junior forward Noel Painter and trails only Belleza who tallied 12 total. Belleza and Jacobson are tied for assists on the season, passing for four each.
Jacobson, Belleza, and Painter have all been keys parts in a revamped Harvard attack. Last year, the Crimson finished the season with only 18 goals on the year and Painter, the leading scorer, had five goals on the season. Jacobson and Painter both increased their goal totals from last season, while the rookie Belleza paced the Crimson offense to a total of 37 goals on the year.
This successful season for Jacobson marks her first full collegiate season.
“Last season I had torn my hipflexer, so it was a rough year,” Jacobson said. “Coming back has been great. I think I have gained confidence, and the team is definitely more disciplined.”
Senior goalkeeper Jenn Hatfield was able to observe Jacobson’s transition from freshmen to sophomore year, and her role on the team for the 2013 season.
“[Eizabeth] has been great for us all year in the forward and midfield lines,” Hatfield said.“She’s a crucial part of our attack and all of the hard work she has put in during the summer and fall really showed [Sunday]…I couldn’t be prouder of her and the whole team.”
Her last score of the game marked Jacobson’s second overtime goal of the season. Her first came against Fairfield in the Crimson’s 4-3 win.
Thanks to Jacobson’s strong showing, Harvard finished off its season 8-9, its best record since 2011.
“Everyone has stepped up more this year,” Jacobson said. “We have realized that we have more potential, so we are pushing each other to play our best.”
The Crimson’s future looks bright, with strong players –Belleza, Jacobson, Painter, and Freshmen Sophie van Weede—returning to the field next year. Van Herwaarden was pleased with the team’s peRformance this year, but he still sees room for development in the upcoming season.
“I am very happy that the hard work that everyone has put in paid off with some wins this year,” van Herwaarden said. “We will continue to grow and work hard to have another improved season next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The men and women of the Harvard sailing felt the wind in their sails this weekend as they competed in four regattas, which ended up being some of their strongest performances all year. With the Atlantic Coast Tournament next weekend, the team has one more chance to show what they’ve got on the water.
HAP MORE TEAM RACE
Many boats sailed in the Coast Guard’s regatta this weekend as two conferences met for the only team-race regatta of the fall season.
12 teams met for 72 rotations of one-on-one match ups on both days. In each rotation, three boats from each team competed and the aggregate lower score won.
“We usually do fleet racing, where we switch out sailors frequently,” junior Brian Drumm said. “Under this different format, it requires a lot of thinking and a lot of teamwork.”
Accompanying Drumm down to Connecticut this weekend was his twin brother Michael, sophomores Jacob Bradt, Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky, and captain Isabel Ruane.
The Crimson finished Saturday on top with a 7-1 record and tied for first at the end of the second round. Harvard went home in second place with an 11-3 record and 78.6 percent winning percentage after losing the tiebreaker with Roger Williams University.
Brian DruMm touched upon the importance of teamwork.
“Usually what plagues a lot of teams is when one boat does poorly, and essentially loses the race for the team, it is very easy for the boat which makes the mistake to make the other boats very frustrated,” Drumm said. “That’s no good for the team dynamic and that would make it really hard for the team to move on and do well in the next race.”
Since teamwork is pivotal in this style of racing, one member of the Crimson had a solution.
“In order to limit the amount of tension we would have the people who were not racing, the people who were less frustrated by this event, discuss objectively on how the race went and how the team can improve,” Drumm said.
SECOND ESTER SISTER ANNUAL
Harvard came out in fifth place for this regatta held down in Newport, RI. Competing this weekend were 20 teams within the same conference.
In the A division, taking first with 55 points for Harvard was sophomore Marek Zaleski and freshman Emma Wheeler.
Zaleski mentioned that the coaches have been noticing a greater sense of anxiety from their sailors in the past few weeks, which limits the team from preforming at its greatest potential. The obvious example of this was the Crimson’s inability to qualify for the Atlantic Coast Championship last weekend.
“In practice, I’d say we’ve gotten better,” Zaleski said. “I think we have sort of calmed down as a team and we went back to the basics good starts, good handling, good decision making in the boat.”
Zaleski noted the starts on Saturday as the weak point for his team’s competition this weekend.
“Last week was very disappointing for us,” he added. “We had a sit-down with the whole team and our coaches and we talked about being more relaxed going forward.”
MIKE HORRN TROPHY
It was a rough showing for Harvard, the hosts for this in-conference FJ regatta, as it came in last place of six schools, and only managed to win one of its 15 match-ups.
MIT came out on top, finishing 13-2 with a 86.7 winning percentage.
The Crimson’s one victory came in the first round against Boston College, who placed fifth in the nation during preseason rankings. Harvard went 1-2-4 in the first round matchup with the Eagles.
HARVARD ICSA MEN’S SINGLEHANDED CHAMPIONSHIP
It was quite a weekend for freshman season standout Juan Perdomo  who took second place at the national championship for single-handed lasers.
The regatta began Friday down in Cranston, RI, and featured 18 sailors from 16 teams across the country. The title went to sophomore Greg Martinez of Georgetown, who finished 10 points lower than Perdomo.
“It was windier than I’m used to, but due to my experience and amount of competing I did this summer, I wasn’t very stressed about that,” Perdomo said.
The freshman took gold at the ISAF Youth World Championships this summer. His talents carried over into the season, as clearly shown by his performance throughout the weeks, including this past weekend. He credits most of his success to his coaches and teammates.
“I’m pretty satisfied with how I turned out for freshman year,” he said. “It definitely shows that there is work to be done but I know I can be better for next year and the years to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For almost eight minutes of the Harvard men’s basketball team’s first half, it seemed as if only one side of the scoreboard was working.
With 9:40 left in the period, Crimson sophomore forward Evan Cummins dished the ball to classmate Siyani Chambers at the top of the key. Chambers dribbled left off of a Cummins screen, and tossed the ball across the paint to a streaking Kyle Casey. The senior caught and dunked the ball in one motion, instigating a 20-0 Crimson run, and burying MIT along the way.
From that point on, it was all Harvard. A nine point lead stretched to 20 and, with 4:23 left in the second half, a Cummins lay-up extended the Harvard advantage to 44.
The end result was a 79-37 victory for the home team on Tuesday night at Lavietes Pavilion, the largest margin of victory for the Crimson since head coach Tommy Amaker took the helm in 2007.
Everyone who suited up for the Crimson saw time on the hard wood, with all but two players—juniors Charlie Anastasi and Alex Nesbitt—attempting at least two field goals. Classmate Wesley Saunders and freshman Zena Edosomwan led the way for the Crimson, tallying 14 and 13 points, respectively.
It was Edosomwan whose reverse lay-up with 12:31 remaining in the contest first pushed the game’s margin to 40. Typical to a night that saw the Engineers shoot 27.9 percent from the field, the play began with a defensive rebound.
Junior forward Jonah Travis fronted his man, Matt Redfield, leading the Engineer to force a shot deep in the paint. The shot went wide and Travis grabbed the rebound and passed the ball ahead to Nesbitt, who found Edosomwan posting up on the low block. The freshman caught the ball, turned, dribbled once, and laid the ball up from the other side of the basket, giving his team the 57-17 advantage.
From that point on, MIT never came within 36 points.
The first half saw four dunks and an additional lay-up ally-oop, with the most emphatic of them initiating the near-eight minutes that saw only the Harvard side of the scoreboard light up.
Two possessions after Casey’s alley-oop, Harvard ran down the clock, completing five passes before Cummins shoveled the ball to Chambers, who knocked down a jumper from the left elbow.
The basket gave the Crimson its first double-digit lead of the game and, and in nine out of 10 of the next possessions, Harvard managed to put the ball in the hoop, extending its advantage to 27 in that span of time.
Despite the offensive proficiency, Amaker attributed his squad’s success to its aggression on the other end of the floor.
“I thought our defense was outstanding in the first half,” Amaker said. “[We played] our D without fouling, [which]…allowed us to get loose balls and rebounds. [We then could use] our speed and athleticism and quickness to get up the floor. I thought we did a pretty decent job.”
It would take MIT until the 1:52 mark to put another notch on the scoreboard, turning the ball over nine times in the process. For the game, the Engineers totaled 29 turnovers, more than quadrupling the number of Harvard miscues.
“Coach was harping on us about playing our game and playing the way Harvard basketball plays,” Casey said. “I thought we clamped up defensively, got some stops, stretched the lead, and made the right plays at the right times. [I think we] came in ready to play and…just took care of business.”
The second half saw more of the same.
Edosomwan’s reverse lay-up was followed by yet another Travis defensive stop. Travis stripped the ball from Redfield, and, in a play strikingly similar to the one that immediately preceded it, shot an outlet pass to Nesbitt. Seconds later, Nesbitt found Travis streaking ahead, who slammed the ball home to make it 59-17.
“[Our bench] guys are great,” Saunders said. “They were ready to go out there and it showed… They came off the bench with a lot of energy, were excited, and did some great things for our team…It was a great way to start off the season.”
As 13 players took the floor for the home team, it is fitting that only bench players scored for Harvard in the last 15:10 of the game. Freshman Matt Fraschilla, in his first collegiate appearance, knocked down back-to-back treys while veteran Dee Giger added six points.
Tuesday’s contest marked the first time Casey played in Lavietes since returning to the squad this fall. Co-captain Brandyn Curry did not suit up for the game.
“It was good to be back,” Casey said. “I thought we took care of business well…. Coming back here, playing in Lavietes, in front of the home crowd…there’s a sense of pride. It was a great feeling to finally get back out here, play a game, win a game, and keep the season going.”

Sometimes it’s easy to feel good about having gotten into Harvard. And then you accidentally turn on the Scripps National Spelling Bee and watch a six-year-old spell a word you can’t even pronounce. The truth is, great though Harvard students may be, there are younger people out there who are already (gasp!) more successful than you are. While you might still have the chance to become the next Zuckerburg, you've sadly missed your slim window of opportunity to become a child prodigy or a pre-teen superstar (unless you already are and that's why you go here, in which case you can stop reading). As you mourn your lost child-star potential, check out our list of people who are both younger and more successful than you are.
Lorde
She’s never seen a diamond in the flesh… but she has seen her first single, "Royals," hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100… and stay there for six weeks, beating out 41-year-old Eminem (take a moment to process how long ago 1999 was) and, somehow, even One Direction. Lorde just turned 17 last Thursday, making her at least a full year younger than the average Harvard freshman.
Gabby Douglas
While we are all unbelievably honored to be attending one of the most squirrel-obsessed colleges in the country, 17 year-old Gabby Douglas has been honored with the nickname “Flying Squirrel”—and two Olympic gold medals.
 
Jaden and Willow Smith
Jaden Smith, 15, has starred in movies like "The Karate Kid" and "The Pursuit of Happyness," released a mixed-tape, started a clothing brand, and even rapped with none other than Justin Bieber. His little sister, Willow, is no slacker, either. At just 13 years old, Willow has acted in several movies, including "I Am Legend," and whipped her hair all the way to number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.
 
Jordan Romero 
Let’s be honest. After climbing five full floors to your dorm room, you sometimes take a little breather before digging out your key. While the struggle of living on the top floor of a dormitory is incredibly real, don’t complain about it to Jordan Romero: four years ago, Jordan topped Mount Everest at the ripe age of 13.
 
Abigail Breslin
When you were 10, you were probably watching "Rugrats," drinking Nesquik, and playing Bop It. Abigail Breslin, on the other hand, was busy being nominated for an Academy Award for her role in "Little Miss Sunshine." Now 17, Abigail has made the transition from child star to near-adult actress (she can currently be seen in "Ender's Game" and "August: Osage County") sans any Britney-style breakdowns.
 
Jack Andraka
Grand prize-winner of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, 16-year-old Jack invented a quick and inexpensive test to detect pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancers. All of this without having ever stepped into LPSA—or onto a college campus.

As much as we love that Conan C. O’Brien '85 was once one of us Harvard students, we can’t help but lament his participation in the the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
And apparently, neither can he. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the comedian recently participated in a panel discussion at the University of Southern California where he commented on why he didn’t tend to hire fellow Lampooners to join him in late night TV. However, no love was lost, as Conan proclaimed, “I wasn’t mad at them, I just wanted the show to have a different sensibility.”
Could it be that the Lampoon is not all it’s cracked up to be? Gasp! We would never have guessed. 
But don’t you worry, many giddy Lampooners found good ole’ desk jobs at the right-hand of David Letterman despite the fact that, as O’Brien’s fellow panelist and Lampoon alum Lawrence O’Donnell ’76 noted, being from the Lampoon was seen at the time as “a strike against you.”
O’Brien also took this opportunity to joke about the rough life of a white male Harvard grad. "Yes, people should stop discriminating against us white people from Harvard," he apparently said. "Enough! Give a white male from Harvard a freakin' chance is what we're here to say!”
Interestingly, panelist Gregory M. Daniels ‘85 credited his classmate Conan with encouraging him not to take “crap jobs” at the beginning of his career.
 Funny, then, how both deigned to work for the Lampoon once upon a time.
