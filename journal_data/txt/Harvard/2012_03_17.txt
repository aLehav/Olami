After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a string of underwhelming seasons, the  Harvard men’s hockey team righted the ship in 2011-12 and stood poised  to claim two of the ECAC’s most prized awards.
Junior  defenseman Danny Biega was one of two finalists for ECAC Hockey Player  of the Year after tallying 34 points in 32 contests, which put him  second in the nation among defenseman with 1.06 points a game.
Behind  the bench, Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 turned a squad some pegged to  finish last in the 12-team ECAC into a title contender and became a  finalist for the Tim Taylor Award, which honors the league’s top coach,  in the process.
But at Thursday  night’s ECAC awards banquet, neither Biega nor his coach came away with  their prestigious accolade. Colgate’s Austin Smith bested the Crimson  blueliner while first-year Union coach Rick Bennett topped Donato.
To some, Bennett’s victory did not come as a surprise.
“[Union  is] good, they have talent, but when you look at the systems, the  attention to detail…that’s all coaching,” Colgate coach Don Vaughan said  in a Monday teleconference, three days before the awards announcements.  “This team has bought into what Rick has been doing, and in my opinion,  [he] is the frontrunner for the Tim Taylor Award.”
Though  the Crimson fell short in two of the league’s biggest honors, Harvard  still took home some hardware from the banquet.  Senior forward Killorn  and Biega earned ECAC All-League First Team nods—the first time Harvard  has had two players on that list since the 2002-03 campaign—and Biega  was named the conference’s “Best Defensive Defenseman.”
Rounding  out the accolades, rookie defenseman Patrick McNally was named to both  the All-ECAC Third Team, and, along with freshman goaltender Steve  Michalek, the all-conference all-rookie team.
The  last time the Crimson boasted two representatives on the all-rookie  team was the 1997-98 season. At that point, Michalek was four years old.  And Donato was still in the prime of his NHL career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team continued its recent tear, and the team’s resurgence could not have come at a better time.
Facing Cornell in a one-game playoff in the ECAC semifinals, the Crimson dominated both offensively and defensively en route to an easy 6-1 win over the Big Red Friday night at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, N.J.
The victory marked the first time all season that the Crimson won three games in a row. The squad looked to make it four Saturday in the finals against No. 6 Union, which advanced earlier in the night with a 6-2 win over Colgate, but it ultimately fell, 3-1.
The third time proved to be the charm for the Crimson, as No. 19 Harvard (13-9-11, 8-5-9 ECAC) defeated No. 13 Cornell (17-8-9, 12-4-6) after losing and tying its Ivy League rival in their previous two matchups.
“I thought we came out and played really well [Friday night] in pretty much all facets of the game,” sophomore defenseman Dan Ford said. “Obviously, scoring six goals is great, and I thought we did a good job defensively, limiting their chances and blocking shots.”
The Crimson scored six straight goals on Friday, two in each period, to build on its eight-goal outburst against Yale in the quarterfinals last Sunday. Sophomore goalie Raphael Girard led Harvard defensively and tallied 18 saves while losing a shutout with only 1:04 remaining in the game.
Forwards senior Alex Killorn and junior Marshall Everson netted two goals apiece while freshman forward Colin Blackwell recorded four assists in the Harvard victory.
The Crimson took control early and never looked back on Friday night.
Having skated down the length of the ice after a defensive zone win by captain defenseman Ryan Grimshaw and senior forward Eric Kroshus, freshman defenseman Patrick McNally began the offensive surge for Harvard with his score just under five minutes into the contest.
Killorn scored soon thereafter at 7:11 with a high shot from the point, assisted by Blackwell and junior defenseman Danny Biega. The senior forward continued his strong play during the winning streak, in which he has four goals and nine points.
“Killorn has been like this for the last three games now where he has just really taken over and has dominated the play,” Ford said. “It was no different [Friday night with his] scoring of some big goals.”
In the second, senior forward Colin Moore gathered a bouncing puck off a rebound from junior forward David Valek and fired it over the left shoulder of Big Red goalie Andy Iles and into the net for his first goal of the season.
Capping off the scoring in the second, Everson finished a series of passes from Blackwell and McNally on the power play with an easy one-timer put in near the right post.
The Crimson complemented its offense with stifling defense, allowing four shots during the period after allowing five in the first. Throughout the game, the Harvard defense was able to block 24 of 53 shot attempts and broke up any momentum Cornell was trying to build.
“Everyone across the board was blocking shots,” Valek said. “It was unbelievable [and] a great team effort, and Raphael Girard made all the saves he had to that got past to him.”
Killorn, having broken free in the neutral zone after a turnover, scored another in the third, beating Iles stick side after a double fake. Everson scored the Crimson’s sixth of the night after tapping in a Blackwell pass from the right side of the net.
Cornell’s Joel Lowry broke up the shutout for Girard with a backhand shot with just over a minute left to play.
The Crimson outshot the Big Red, 30-19, and Harvard’s nation-leading power play was successful on one of five attempts. Cornell was zero for two on the man advantage.
Harvard last won the ECAC championship in 2006, and the Crimson’s run in 2012 has played out much like it did then.
Both squads had a first-round bye and lost in the opening game of the quarterfinals. Both teams then followed a close win in the second game with eight goals in a victorious third game followed by six scores in a semis win.
Back in the finals for the first time since 2008 with its seventh straight ECAC semis win, Harvard looked to finish its strong run against Union. Coming in, Harvard was 0-1-1 against the top-seeded Dutchmen and last faced them in January at Fenway Park, where the Crimson fell, 2-0. Saturday, the Crimson’s playoff run came to an end after Union rallied late for a 3-1 win.
“[After beating Cornell], there was a great feeling in the locker room.... But we came to Atlantic City with a goal to win two games,” Ford said. “[But] quickly the focus was turned to the game against Union in the championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second straight game, the New York Knicks earned a victory, handily defeating the Indiana Pacers, 115-100, on Friday night at Madison Square Garden. But for the second straight game, Jeremy Lin ’10 wasn’t the one spearheading his team’s success.
Lin, statistically speaking, was strictly mediocre. He shot 42.8 percent from the field and totaled 13 points on three-for-seven shooting. The Harvard alum grabbed five boards as well as five assists and turned the ball over three times—a limited number compared to that of some of his recent games.
With the recent resignation of Mike D’Antoni and the readjustment to new interim coach Mike Woodson, some big questions surrounded Knicks basketball. How would Lin fit into the new system? How long until Baron Davis takes over the starting point guard position?
Prior to the game, Woodson spoke to this issue.
“Jeremy’s a big part of what we do,” Woodson said. “He’s our starting point guard. He and I are on the same page.”
Due to an unfortunate second-quarter hamstring injury to Davis, that dilemma, for now, is simplified. Davis did not return to the game, and there is no timetable for when he could suit up again for the team.
For Lin, these next few weeks are all about regaining the mentality that the team had during its February transformation.
“You can’t really describe how much fun we were having during the seven-game win streak,” Lin told reporters after the game. “And that’s what we’re building toward right now. I think we get a couple more and it’s going to be even more fun. We’re just building as a team, we’re improving and I think we’re developing our chemistry right now.”
The Knicks’ main contributor in the game was Tyson Chandler. The center shot 8 for 11 and pulled down seven rebounds and four blocks. Both Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire did not shoot well, finishing with combined 7 for 21 from the field. Interestingly, during the pre-game announcements, the Madison Square Garden crowd jeered and booed Anthony—a treatment only games ago reserved for D’Antoni.
Though it seems that Linsanity belongs to the days of the past, it looks like the Knicks, with two consecutive wins, may be starting to get back on track. And, after the week that this ball club has had, it will take those W’s—whether they are worthy of the word play that February brought about or not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After practicing in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., for a week, the Harvard women’s golf team got back in the swing of things in a match against Nova Southeastern on Thursday. Playing the 6130-yard, par-72 PGA National course in North Palm Beach, the Crimson beat the Sharks by 11 strokes, 311-322.
Though ranked lower than Nova Southeastern and unable to take advantage of continuous outdoor practices during the winter months, the Crimson squad all posted sub-80 scores, with freshman Tiffany Lim leading the way with a 75.  Sophomore Bonnie Hu, also a Crimson business editor, followed with a 78, and freshman Brenna Nelsen, senior Jane Lee, and Cho all shot 79.
“The match that we play over spring break is always a little tough,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It’s competition after only a couple days outdoors. I expect to see good scores hole-by-hole and strange scores hole-by-hole. It was windy [on Thursday], and Nova is ranked in the top 80. To play pretty well, come away with a victory, and to see mostly good scores is quite encouraging.”
Though Harvard won as a team, Sharks freshmen Liliana Cammisa had the best round of the day, shooting a 74. Junior Abbey Gittings shot a 79, while senior Claudia Wolf and freshman Daniela Ortiz posted scores of 81 and 88, respectively.
The weather proved to be a factor for both teams, as the players struggled against the wind and thunderstorms forced an hour break in the contest. After playing in an indoor facility for so long, the Crimson had to battle the unfamiliar.
“The weather made the course pretty tough to play. [The break] threw off the normal rhythm of the 18-hole round, but all of us handled it pretty well,” captain Christine Cho said. “The best thing that we did was stay consistent with our games. They weren’t as sharp as we wanted them to be, but we all hung on there and grinded it out. We managed the course really well.”
“The best part of the team’s play was staying organized with all their pieces and managing things correctly,” Rhoads added. “It was raining [Thursday], and they were playing an unfamiliar course. They stayed organized and didn’t panic and worked on their individual pieces.”
In order to prepare for the first match of the spring season, the squad practiced indoors all winter, but this past week marked the first time that the Harvard team had the opportunity to return to the elements.
“We try to follow a basic script and practice a lot the first two days. They all know from the indoor work what their packages are, what they need to work on,” Rhoads said. “The ball play gives you enough information to work on the micro-corrections. The first couple days are trying to implement the micro-corrections. They try to put all those skills together.”
“They’ve been at in Saturday to Wednesday,” Rhoads continued. “For the most part, I’m pleased.”
Despite the victory, the team acknowledges that there is plenty of room for improvement.
“All of us are still rusty considering the long break that we’ve had,” Cho said “A lot of us could definitely go lower. We need to continue getting warmed up and getting our games back in order.”
But so far, early in the spring season, Rhoads is pleased with the squad’s progress.
“Most of what we need to work on is tiny corrections that should be fixed with time,” Rhoads said. “We are a little ahead of where we normally are in the year. We just need to stay hungry going into the rest of the season.”
Harvard will suit up next at the Rebel Intercollegiate at Ole Miss Golf Club on April 7-8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a little more than five minutes left in the game and a lead of four points, it looked as if Harvard women’s basketball would pull out its second WNIT upset in as many games. But in the final 4:48, Temple outscored the Crimson, 12-5, and ultimately took the game, 64-59, Saturday night at McGonigle Hall in Philadelphia, Pa.
Adhering to a season-long pattern, Harvard (18-12, 10-4 Ivy) was faced with an early deficit from which it had to battle back. This problem had plagued the team throughout Ivy play and resulted in a good number of the team’s in-conference losses, notably to both Brown and Yale.
Despite the loss, the team considered the game to be a great effort against such a strong, highly touted opponent.
“I’m very, very proud of them,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I wish they could have been rewarded with a win. I thought we were mismatched height- and speed-wise but I thought we outplayed them. I just couldn’t be prouder of everyone. That kind of effort should have been rewarded with a win.”
For the game, the Crimson was out-rebounded, 45-33. Junior Victoria Lippert felt that her team’s defeat could be attributed to the amount of Owls’ 19-10 edge in offensive rebounds.
“I think towards the end they got a couple too many second chances,” Lippert said. “[Owls forward Brittany Lewis] got a few too many offensive rebounds, too many put-backs. We just weren’t able to get over the hump.”
The initial comeback for the Crimson came directly after its biggest deficit of the game. With 7:06 remaining in the first period, the Owls (23-9, 13-1 Atlantic 10) stretched their lead to a game-high 11—but shortly before halftime the advantage was cut down to five.
The instigator of this run? None other than co-captain Brogan Berry, who led her team with 21 points, shooting three of five from beyond the arc and 7 of 14 overall. Berry checked back into the game at the 5:15 mark and quickly scored a basket, hit a free throw, and notched a steal to get her team back into the game.
But Temple did not back down and ended the half on a run of its own, ultimately taking the lead back up to 10 and setting the half time score at 39-29.
A 7-0 Harvard run at the start of the second half cut the deficit to three—the closest the game had been since a Berry basket with 12:56 left in the first period.
After the teams traded shots from the charity stripe for the next few minutes, junior Emma Golen hit a shot from deep to give Harvard its first lead of the game, 49-48. And, thanks to three jumpers from Golen, Berry, and sophomore Milly Mullins, the lead soon expanded to four, 56-52.
“We were excited,” Lippert said regarding her team’s mentality during its late-game run. “I think all of us were on the same page knowing that we were still in the game even with a little bit of a deficit. We knew that when you get down a little bit, it’s all about getting defensive stops. I think from top to bottom, everyone was really into the game.”
But thanks to six free throws and three layups from the Owls in the final minutes of the half, the Crimson found itself on the wrong side of the scoreboard when the game went final.
For Harvard, at the night’s end, the attention returned to the seniors, Berry and co-captain Lindsay Louie, who had just witnessed their last collegiate game.
Berry, thanks to Saturday night’s performance, finished her career with the second most assists all-time for the Crimson and fourth most in the history of the Ivy League with 525. Additionally, her 1,458 points are good for sixth best in the Harvard record books and 26th in the league.
Delaney-Smith spoke to Berry’s accomplishments as well as what the two of them will leave behind.
“I’m thrilled for [Berry],” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s been so valuable to this program for four years. Louie, as well, was invaluable off the court. It was a great way for them to go out. They did all they could and left everything on the court. There is such a proud legacy for both.”
Lippert agreed with her coach, emphasizing what the seniors have meant to the team on and off the court.
“They are really phenomenal leaders and captains,” Lippert said. “There may have been a few tears [on Saturday] just because we love them so much, and we’ll definitely miss them being a part of the team.”
Ultimately, though, it came back to Saturday’s game.
“We closed the gap,” Lippert said. “It definitely is sad we weren’t able to finish with the win, but there was a great energy and feel to the game the entire way. I couldn’t be more in love with the team. It was a really good game to finish on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With spring break winding down, senior Meghan Leddy and freshman Courtney Otto spent their final days away from classes in Auburn, Ala., for the NCAA Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships from Thursday through Saturday.
In the end, neither of the two swimmers posted strong enough times in the opening session to make it back for the finals in the afternoon sessions.
“I thought both Meghan and Courtney represented Harvard very well,” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said.  “This is a very competitive meet, and you really have to get out there in the morning swim to be able to make it back for the finals at night.”
Morawski said the atmosphere of the meet was different from what the swimmers are used to.
“This is [Leddy and Otto’s] first time coming to NCAAs, and there’s a lot of emotion involved,” Morawski said.  “We won the Ivy league championships.  To come back from that, where you’re surrounded by the team and everything is team first, and then to come out here with just two swimmers, it’s a very different environment.”
Otto first stepped up on the block on Thursday to swim the 500-yard freestyle and finished in 4:51.65, earning her 54th at the meet.
“It was nice to focus on one event [each day],” Otto said. “But it was also a little nerve-wracking, knowing I only had one chance per day.”
During the Friday session, Leddy finished the 100 backstroke with a time of 55.72. Her time was just .56 seconds off of her personal best—also the school record—placing her at 59th overall.
“It was a little bit of a different meet, a different ball game,” Leddy said. “I think we both had strong swims, not our best times.”
Otto also competed on Friday and clocked in at 4:14.58 in the 400 IM, good for 30th.
“I was pretty happy overall,” Otto said.  “I didn’t go the times I had wanted to go, but having experience, especially freshman year, is really crucial to going forward.”
Both women competed again on Saturday, Leddy in the 200 backstroke and Otto in the 200 fly. Leddy finished her final race of her Crimson career in 1:58.48, taking 42nd place. Otto ended up 24th in her last event with a time of 1:57.47, .62 seconds away from qualifying for the finals.
Though neither swimmer made it to the afternoon, Morawski was pleased that the women qualifed for the championships in the first place.
“It is so special to be invited to the NCAA,” Morawski said.  “There are only 30 people in the country per event to be invited.  And when you have 350 Division I schools and a lot of them with scholarships, to be in the top 30 in the country is something.”

If you're on campus and tired of eating cereal for dinner (or worse, setting fire to your hall kitchen attempting to cook pasta), tonight you can satisfy your taste buds with the exotic cuisines of Pakistan, India, and the Middle East at Safar: A Journey of Taste, a banquet organized by Harvard students to support the millions of Pakistanis who are still suffering in the wake of the 2010-2011 floods that destroyed much of the country's arable land.
"What we want people to understand about this cause is that unlike a lot of other causes that have immediate relief efforts, ours is a long term sustained effort to show our support to a country that hasn’t received a lot of attention from donors and aid agencies," said Nur N. Ibrahim, one of the banquet organizers, who is also a Crimson photographer.
Ibrahim explained that donations from the banquet will go towards one cause in particular: rebuilding schools.   The suggested donation is $10 and 100 percent of the money raised will go to The Citizens Foundation to support the rebuilding of a school in Sonmiani, a village located in one of the poorest provinces of Pakistan. "
We want the children to have a place to go and Pakistan is one of the worst countries in term of literacy, so this is an opportunity to build better schools as well," Ibrahim said.
The banquet will take place tonight from 7 to 9 p.m. in the Winthrop JCR and will feature cuisine from restaurants in the Cambridge and Boston area including Cafe Sushi, Sabra Grill, Tamarind Bay, Fordee's, and the Falafel Corner, just to name a few.   To learn more about the event, visit the Facebook page. Attend Safar and take a journey to support a great cause while, of couse, getting your fix of good food.
