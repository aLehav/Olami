After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What does it mean for science to be an integral part of a liberal-arts education? How does understanding science productively complement the ability to read Shakespeare closely or to dissect a painter’s artistic intent? Part of the answer rests on the intellectual value of tackling a wide range of problems, hence gaining broad facility with ideas drawn from many fields. Problems are infamously disrespectful of boundaries, and thus solutions often demand openness to the approaches and lessons learned from seemingly disparate fields. To focus one’s intellectual passion is clearly worthwhile, but to do so with blinders on is to risk a narrowness of perspective that becomes limiting later on. It is this appreciation of breadth and the intellectual flexibility that comes with it that first attracted me to a liberal-arts education—first as a student and then as a faculty member. Today, the teaching of science in a liberal-arts setting is a continued source of excitement and inspiration.
It is the teaching of science to a freshman audience that is particularly fulfilling and at the same time challenging—partly because my colleagues and I don’t subscribe to the long-standing notion that one should teach one kind of science to future science concentrators and another to future non-science concentrators. In the freshman year we believe that all students should have access to a meaningful introduction to science—one that prepares future science concentrators to take further coursework, but also one that gives future non-science concentrators a solid ground to understand a wide range of issues related to the sciences. In other words, future poets, artists, lawyers, and politicians deserve a genuine introduction to science the same way that future scientists deserve genuine engagement with Heidegger. Science therefore thrives in a liberal-arts context, and all of the other fields are enriched by its presence.
Let’s consider an example drawn from the realm of public health. Science may explore the molecular details of how a virus like HIV spreads, uncover how HIV causes disease, and even design drugs that inhibit its replication. However, it is through the social sciences that we discover how human behavior and cultural norms help shape the HIV epidemic, and it is the arts and humanities that produce some of the most vivid reflections of the personal and societal toll of AIDS for future generations to consider. Coming to terms with and embracing this multiplicity of perspectives provides us with a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the HIV epidemic as a scientific problem, a societal challenge, and a profound human tragedy. The liberal arts give us the means to wrap our arms and minds around such complex challenges, strengthening our intellectual prowess while stoking a collective hope that we will find solutions.
Although interdisciplinary thinking can drive productive and broad discourse between, say, the sciences and the humanities, what of the insights gained at the interface of different fields within the domain of the natural sciences? The mining of such productive friction is a hallmark of science today. Cell biologists collaborate with engineers to understand how physical forces shape developing tissues. Chemists collaborate with biologists to unlock the remarkable chemistry used by microbes to degrade environmental toxins. And computer scientists collaborate with structural biologists to harness the properties of biological macromolecules to re-imagine the computer chip. So why is it that the experience of interdisciplinarity is far too often delayed until the late stages of an undergraduate career? The traditional wisdom at colleges across the country is that understanding the productive interface between scientific disciplines first requires full tool boxes from each of the fields, tool boxes that are packed during the freshman and sophomore years. Then, if you make it to the upper level science courses, light dawns, and you are ushered into 21st century science, complete with its porous boundaries between fields. Unfortunately, however, far too many students never make it to the dawn.
Introducing undergraduates to an interdisciplinary perspective on science is often positioned as antagonistic to delving deeply into the concepts and methods of individual fields, which perhaps explains why the latter so often precedes the former in traditional curricula. This antagonism is a fallacy, and  is one that threatens to narrow the pipeline of students engaged in science as we delay their exposure to the way so many scientists operate today. In 2004, colleagues from all the life-science departments got together to address this and other challenges related to the teaching of science at Harvard. The outcome of our deliberations was an interdisciplinary freshman foundation of life-sciences courses that now serves a cluster of nine concentrations, counts toward general education requirements and enrolls almost 40 percent of the freshman class. Since the interdisciplinary courses were launched in 2005, the number of life sciences concentrators has also increased by more than 30 percent.
Interdisciplinarity does not replace deep and detailed engagement with individual fields; rather, it provides freshmen with an engaging context that motivates the in-depth pursuit of a particular science. Thus, not only does science belong as an integral part of a liberal-arts curriculum, but the fundamental principles of the liberal-arts approach are fully convergent with the interdisciplinary teaching of science. It is time we stopped viewing science as simply one of several specialized plug-ins that go into a liberal-arts curriculum and focused instead on the benefits of integrative thinking both within the natural sciences and between the other fields represented at Harvard. It is time we liberated science within the liberal arts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a recent sunny April afternoon, I was standing by the rhinos outside the Biological Laboratories meeting with visiting prefrosh and answering their questions about research opportunities for undergraduates at Harvard.  “How easy is it for undergraduates, especially freshmen, to get involved in research in the life sciences at Harvard?” one of them asked.  What they really wanted to know was, “If I am interested in doing research in the life sciences, tell me why I should come to Harvard.”
The prefrosh are not alone in their interest in research. In a survey conducted among students concentrating in the sciences at Harvard in 2008-09 by the Student Advisory Board for Science, 80 percent of the respondents said they believe that research is an important part of their science education.  But what are the real benefits of an undergraduate research experience? Why should advisors encourage students to get involved in research? And if we agree that it is important, how can Harvard stay competitive with its peer institutions in providing undergraduates in the sciences with research opportunities?
Arthur Ellis, writing in the Chronicle of Higher Education, suggests that the undergraduate research experience is beneficial in several ways, and he makes a strong case for undergraduate research as an integral part of a college education in general. He believes that undergraduate research is valuable, among other reasons, because it is a method to train creative thinkers regardless of their final career choice: “The scholarship at the core of academic research lays the foundation for innovation: Well-designed research projects intrinsically encourage risk taking as they explore the unknown. Research promotes critical and creative thinking, the habits of mind that nurture innovation; creates a sense of intellectual excitement and adventure; and provides the satisfaction of real accomplishment.”
More specifically in the sciences, exposure to hands-on work in the laboratory or field teaches analytical-thinking skills. Participating in basic research also helps students learn how to frame appropriate questions, design experiments, and evaluate new data. A senior thesis may provide a capstone experience for an undergraduate. Further, laboratory work may inform career decisions and paths by helping students decide between graduate school and/or medical school, or whether to seek a career in industry or health sciences.
Clearly if Harvard wants to continue attracting the best science students, it must promote a climate in which undergraduate research is the norm and not the exception.
In the past few years, Harvard has demonstrated a strong commitment to undergraduate research by increasing support for students who want to work in the lab or the field. Improved efforts in science advising have helped smooth the way for students seeking research experience. There is increasing fellowship support available to students doing summer research projects both here and abroad. For example, four years ago, Harvard established The Program for Research in Science and Engineering, a residential program open to all Harvard undergraduates conducting summer research in the natural sciences. The PRISE Fellows now have the opportunity not only to engage in research full time but also to participate in a vibrant undergraduate community. This summer, about 120 PRISE Fellows will be working with Harvard faculty at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Medical School, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and other Harvard-affiliated institutions. There is good reason for focusing on summer research. Term-time research, while valuable, does not replace the intensive experience of working on a project full time for more than two months during the summer. Students typically spend six to 12 hours per week working in the lab during the term, perhaps less if the lab is located off-campus. During the summer, however, students can work on their research project full time. This focused experience allows them to become immersed in the research culture at Harvard and more fully integrated into their research group. Taking part in regular group meetings or simply engaging in informal conversations with experienced researchers often leads to new ideas and insights in the practice of science. Moreover, having the uninterrupted time to conduct significant experiments and to collect, analyze, and discuss data is more likely to yield meaningful results. These results may eventually lead to a thesis or even a paper for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
Many students come to Harvard excited by the opportunity to participate in the extraordinary research environment here. Our goal should be to foster that enthusiasm and curiosity, and the best way to meet this goal is to ensure that inquiry-based research is a fundamental component of the College’s educational mission. Indeed, as one of the foremost research institutions in the world, Harvard must meet the challenge of ensuring that all undergraduates at Harvard, and especially those in the sciences, have the opportunity to engage in research as part of their education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Something interesting is happening in Arizona. Two bills are on the table, one targeting illegal immigrants and one targeting ethnic-studies classes in local schools. Somehow, as I follow the controversy surrounding these two pieces of legislation, I’m reminded of another time when I watched a curious thing taking place in the state of Arizona. It was the early 1990s, I was in ninth grade in Cleveland, Ohio, and the issue was the observance of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.
Arizona had previously observed the national Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday but had rescinded the holiday in 1986 under Governor Evan Mecham. Then-Governor J. Fife Symington III ’68, when he came into office in 1991, refused to bring the holiday back to the state despite passionate appeals from a small, but determined, group of activists within the state. Initially, Senator John S. McCain supported and defended Symington in his refusal, but as the political winds changed due to boycotts and public outcry so did McCain, especially once it became clear that Arizona stood to lose millions of dollars on the issue.
You see, Arizona was in line to host a very lucrative little football game called the Super Bowl. The National Football League got involved and told Arizona to honor the holiday, threatening that “if anything was done to dishonor the memory of Dr. King,” the committee would vote to rescind the awarding of the Super Bowl to the state of Arizona. Even McCain’s midstream flip-a-roo was not enough; Arizona voters struck down the holiday, and the NFL ultimately changed the site of the 1993 Super Bowl from Tempe, Ariz. to Pasadena, Calif.
Among other reasons for the change, the NFL cited the fact that the majority of NFL players were African-American, and it would therefore be bad business for the organization if it were to insult its employees. In the end, according to some estimates, the loss of the Super Bowl and the ensuing boycotts associated with Arizona’s stance cost the state approximately $350 million in revenue and gave it two large self-inflicted black eyes in the process.
Arizona has stepped back into the proverbial ethnic boxing ring again with Senate Bill 1070, which was signed by current Governor Jan K. Brewer, and House Bill 2281, which was pushed mainly by Superintendent of Public Instruction Thomas C. Horne ’67 (Horne is also running for the position of state attorney general). SB 1070 requires that “for any lawful conduct made by a law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or subdivision of this state, where reasonable suspicion exists that this person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person.” And HB 2281 “prohibits a school district or charter school from including courses or classes that either promote the overthrow of the U.S. government or promote resentment toward a race or class of people” or “are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group” or that “advocate ethnic solidarity.”
If nothing changes before July 29, when these laws go into effect, these two public officials have all but guaranteed another self-inflicted knockout punch for Arizona’s tourism economy and probable political exile once the political winds shift away from them. The Major League Baseball Players Association released a statement through its Executive Director Michael Weiner in response to the immigration bill, stating, “The Major League Baseball Players Association opposes this law as written. We hope that the law is repealed or modified promptly. If the current law goes into effect, the MLBPA will consider additional steps necessary to protect the rights and interests of our members.”
That approximately 25 percent of the players in Major League Baseball and more than 48 percent of the players in the Minor league/Cactus league are of Latino descent should not be lost on the MLB and its commissioner, Allan H. Selig. The MLB has the opportunity right now to take a firm stance like the NFL did in the ’90s and move its product away from a state that could possibly detain and/or lock up a fourth of their employees based simply on how they look. San Diego Padres star Adrian Gonzalez has already come out stating that he will refuse to play in the All-Star game this year, which is scheduled to take place in Phoenix, if SB 1070 goes into effect, and it is very likely that many other players will follow.
Observing as a ninth grader what the NFL did 20 years ago left me with the impression that Arizona was not a very hospitable place for African-Americans. Today the target of Arizona’s animus has changed. Immigrants and ethnic-studies programs are now in the spotlight, and I wonder, what are ninth graders in Arizona and around the country thinking today when they look at the goings on in that state? It is almost incomprehensible that in America today the state of Arizona would ban children in high school from taking classes that allow them to learn about the history of specific people groups. What’s next on the banning list? Well, it could conceivably be anything that ruffles Mr. Horne’s feathers. The governor has also recently released a statement that she will not tolerate “racial profiling” in her state, which appears to be in direct contradiction to the law she just signed. Perhaps the governor and superintendent don’t quite realize just how much damage their actions will cause; if these two pieces of legislation become a reality, they will have truly razed Arizona.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week a sophomore asked me to sum up my Harvard experience. It was during my last dinner in Annenberg, and seeing so many freshmen in one place made me nostalgic. I wanted to answer her as truthfully as possible. I answered, “I wish I had either studied harder or had more fun.” I didn’t study nearly as much as I should have and I didn’t have nearly as much fun as I should have been having, based on the amount of studying that was not getting done. But more importantly, I wish I had more time. I wish I had the time to do it all over again—and do it better.
I wish I had made more friends. I wish I had kept up with my old friends. Seeing people that I haven’t seen since freshman year during senior week just highlights all of the fun we could have had in the past three years. Now we probably will never see each other again, at least this skinny and with this much hair.
I wish I had gone out of my comfort zone and tried new things. New subjects, new classes, new sports. Did you know that there is a club for clowns? A club for surfers? In Boston?  Freshman year saw me throwing myself into school activities, afraid that I wouldn’t make any friends if I didn’t, since I didn’t go to parties. But I went for the things I did in high school: the radio station, journalism, even Ultimate Frisbee (although in high school, it was a more informal extracurricular pursuit). After simultaneously joining the intramural and the women’s club Ultimate teams, I tore my ACL before classes even started while playing intramural Ultimate Frisbee. I later found out I was playing for the wrong entryway. This ruined my freshman year. I retreated inward because I was either constantly on crutches, in a brace, or spaced out on Vicodin.
I wish I had gotten into IM crew earlier. It turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my Harvard career, and I waited until the spring of my senior year to even try it. Yes, I was terrible and the Dunster boat ran into us; Dan Boyne was snarky and I, subbing as stroke seat, almost fell out of the boat. Playing a sport, being part of a team again after four sedentary years, was amazing. I met some awesome Adams residents and I wish I had met them earlier. I should have met them earlier, because we were all socially seniors.
I wish I had studied harder. I wish I had realized that yeah, even though I want to write for Rolling Stone now, perhaps in four years time I may change my mind. I may want to go to graduate school instead. After being a slacker overachiever in high school, I simply became a slacker. I figured I didn’t need good grades, because I was already at Harvard. I spent most of my freshman fall semester doing what my parents hadn’t let me do in high school, the really “important” things. My parents made me go to bed at 9 p.m. everyday, so I stayed up until 4 a.m., doing absolutely nothing. I hadn’t been allowed to watch television, so I spent lunches, dinners, evenings, and weekends in my room watching “Sex and the City,” “Gilmore Girls,” and “The Office”—basically any and all TV shows on DVD my roommates had. I eschewed Annenberg for lunches of ramen and beef jerky in front of the TV. It was glorious at the time, but looking back, I missed out on a lot: face to face interaction with Domna, befriending the rest of 2010, getting decent nutrition—all wasted opportunities.
I wish I had not procrastinated. I tried giving it up for Lent, but I kept putting it off. Even this parting shot is being dashed between senior week events. If I had started that one paper a little earlier, went to that one class more than half the time, taken that one course pass-fail…then I’d be in a better place. Perhaps now I would have a job and a place to live after graduation. But I don’t want to live anywhere but here. I want to stay at Harvard forever.
Now that I’m done with Harvard, I wish I weren’t looking back on my four years with regret, wishing I had spent my time differently. I’ve loved nearly every second of my time here. I can’t imagine going anywhere else. But there’s just so much more left to do and it’s sad to think that I’ve missed out. Things will never be the same. We will never be this young again. We will never have our closest friends living just down the hall. We will never be able to excuse our mistakes because “we’re just college students.”
Harvard has been a wonderful experience and I would need years and years to fully appreciate all of it, to explore all the College has to offer. And though my parents will kill me for saying this, I wish I weren’t graduating.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, news broke that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would become the first university to contribute intellectual property to the GlaxoSmithKline patent pool for “neglected tropical diseases,” diseases that predominantly or exclusively affect people in developing countries. The MIT announcement is part of a growing movement among universities to focus on gaps in a drug-development system that too often neglects the needs of patients in the developing world.
By placing its patents in the GlaxoSmithKline pool, MIT agrees to allow other researchers to use its intellectual property to help fight neglected tropical diseases. But use is limited: According to GlaxoSmithKline, the intellectual property must relate directly to NTDs, and products that are developed from the pool will “go solely to the least developed countries.” This small group of 50 least developed countries will exclude low- and middle-income nations like India, China, and Brazil, where a majority of the world’s poor live and most of the developing world’s affordable generic medicines are produced.
While patent pooling may be a step toward opening up access to knowledge for researchers who wish to help people in developing countries, students at MIT have asked, “Is MIT doing enough?” Neglected tropical diseases are not the only diseases that kill people in developing countries: Heart disease, HIV/AIDS, and stroke are among the leading causes of death among people in poor countries. These diseases are not “neglected,” because they affect the rich and poor alike, and new technologies are being developed to treat them. Yet it is the poor who disproportionately die from these diseases, due in part to lack of access to appropriate care.
Universities like MIT are starting to acknowledge that patenting can serve as a double-edged sword. It can be used to develop university technology into useful products by attracting investors, but it can also interfere with access to knowledge by blocking researchers and patients from accessing vital ideas created at universities. What can academic institutions do to ensure that all important treatments coming from our labs—not just NTD treatments—reach people in developing countries?
Last November, a group of universities, which included Harvard, Yale, and Boston University, came together to support a joint statement announcing a broad-based commitment to “promote availability of health technologies in developing countries for essential medical care.” One of the key points of this document stated that university intellectual property should not serve as a barrier to global access: Drugs created in academic labs should not be priced out of reach for poor people in poor countries. The joint statement has now gained the support of the National Institute of Health, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Boston-area Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s Hospitals.
MIT was invited to sign on to the statement but declined to do so, leading students to question whether the institution has lived up to its mission to “bring [its] knowledge to bear on the world’s greatest challenges.” In this context, MIT’s patent-pooling announcement appears to be an unsuccessful attempt to catch up with Harvard and other Boston-area academic-research centers in the race to deliver essential medicines to patients in developing countries.
Since signing the statement, Harvard University has begun employing creative licensing strategies to ensure that its patents will not be asserted in ways that harm patients in the developing world. Even better, Harvard’s strategy is broad-based. The office of technology development is working to apply global-access strategies to all medical technologies emerging from our labs—not just neglected tropical diseases. It is also developing ways to provide access in lower-middle-income countries like India, where the majority of the population still cannot afford expensive medical treatments. While much work remains to be done, Harvard has begun to show itself as a leader among peer institutions in implementing its commitments to global access.
The patent pool announced by international aid group Unitaid last December serves as another broad-based initiative to help the poor in developing countries. Whereas the patent pool run by GlaxoSmithKline focuses on research, not manufacturing, and limits its reach to the 50 least developed countries, the Unitaid Patent Pool will allow generic drugs to be made and sold across the developing world. The Unitaid pool focuses on HIV/AIDS therapies, many of which have originated at academic research centers. Placing patents in the Unitaid Patent Pool would be the next best move for universities wishing to support global health.
MIT’s announcement is an important step in acknowledging that creative strategies must be used to stop university patents from serving as a barrier to further innovation and access to essential medicines. Yet contributing patents to the GlaxoSmithKline patent pool is the least a university can do. Let us hope that MIT, along with other universities who have yet to join in a more broad-based commitment to global access, will soon get the message that they can do much more.

Born on Dec. 17, 1917 in a small factory town in upper New York, Frederick R. Witherby '40 is probably the oldest Harvard alum coming to this year's reunions.
While at the College, Witherby majored in History and Literature (oh yes it was still referred to it as "major" back then), and was involved with many student organizations such as the Hasty Pudding, tennis team, and football team.
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Witherby took a four-year break from Harvard Law School and became one of the many young Americans who served in World War II.
As a naval officer, Witherby first served on an aircraft carrier in the Atlantic. He was then stationed in Kunming, China with the 14th Army Air Force in Photo Intelligence under the famous General Claire Lee Chenault.
After WWII, Witherby finished his studies at the Law School and became a lawyer with the Raytheon Company. He later became the chief counsel for New England Life Insurance Company, from which he retired at the age of 65.
However, reflecting on his life on the eve of his 70th reunion, Witherby said that the single professional achievement he is most proud of is his service in a variety of charity organizations such as the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
Witherby now lives in Westwood, Mass. with his Radcliffe-educated wife, with whom he has raised two Harvard-graduated lawyers.

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: June 15, 2010
An earlier version of the May 26 FlyBy post "(Maybe) The Oldest Alum On Campus" incorrectly said that Frederick R. Witherby '40 became the chief counsel for New York Life Insurance Company. The correct name is New England Life Insurance Company.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have a grave matter to discuss and I implore you, dear reader, to feel sympathy for my cause. Please, give me a chance to speak up and be heard regarding the abundance of problems that surround us.
These problems are of a very distinct nature. Those of us who will be graduating tomorrow have become all too familiar with them. When I mention what is wrong, I’m talking about that feeling you get when you find out English is not your Teaching Fellow’s first language. It’s that forlorn look on your face when you burst onto Mass Ave. just in time to see the 1636er speeding off toward the Quad. Maybe it’s the time spent waiting insufferably for the ninety-year-old exam proctor to read instructions telling you to remain “incommunicado” in the event of a fire—or waiting for your TF to do the same, now that there is no room in the budget for the elderly. It could be seeing your linkmate’s eyes go wide and head roll back when the swiper in your House’s dining hall enforces interhouse restrictions.
Or perhaps it’s the travesty of finding yourself housed in a walk-through suite during your very own senior year. Or the chorus of complaints about the truly criminal quality of care available at University Health Services. It’s having to take the long way after finding the gate locked at 8 p.m. It’s the shellshock of finding out that your House formal will not, in fact, have an open bar. It’s having to take a school bus to get there, like a common schoolchild.
Many will argue that it’s the bombardment of injustices we face when we cross the threshold into the servery. It’s finding out that the menu lied to us. It’s having carbohydrates and nothing else shoved down our throats at brain break. It’s the squash. Ultimately, whether it’s having hot breakfast torn from our fingers or the near-mutiny resulting from the removal of Korean barbeque, Harvard University Dining Services perhaps is the most heinous agent of them all.
One of the gravest offenses is, naturally, our simply horrendous and mismanaged social programming. It is someone’s responsibility to provide us with enjoyable means of socialization, and that person has failed. It’s the collective apathy we feel when the date of the Yardfest artist announcement approaches, as we prepare for the inevitable disappointment once more. It’s having your inalienable human right to receive party grants violated.
We must endure such injustices on the regular. Always struggling, we sigh, we roll our eyes in disgust, and we speak aloud to any who will listen about the real mistreatments that seem like a barrage of death sentences.
I’m talking, of course, about first-world problems.
Harvard students of every make and model must live lives filled with these egregious interruptions and hindrances. We are saddled with a burden that most in our world will never be forced to face.
And it’s for this reason precisely that we should cherish all the first-world problems in our lives.
First-world problems, though I’ve done my best to mock them, are not solely valuable as a means of lampooning Harvard students. First-world problems, though we can joke about them, serve as a reminder of our station in life.
In these moments we can reflect upon the mind-blowing nature of how uniquely lucky we are to find ourselves with the opportunity to have spent four years at Harvard College. It speaks volumes about the inherent goodness in a place that inspires us to spend more time playing the GirlTalk blame game than actually studying. When we’re always getting worked up over the small stuff, it seems to be a good indication that the heart and soul of the University is solid.
Of course it’s cliché to lecture Ivy Leaguers on the over-privileged nature of their comfortable lives. But I’m not really trying to do that. We all really do face first-world problems every day. It doesn’t make us bad people to be annoyed by trivialities of life. We’re only human. But if we can use these little anecdotes as red flags to remind ourselves of the goodness we enjoy and have enjoyed for four long years, they lose their triviality and become meaningful.
It’s our job to actually take the extra second to go beyond the immediate outrage or cynicism and recognize that, honestly, whatever is causing your struggles is likely trivial. First-world problems are laughable; as such, they should make you laugh, recognize the absurdity of the situation, and move on with being happy. Because here, we have no reason not to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before I wrote the second draft of this parting shot, my best friend and I sat down on our common-room floor and had another one of our by-now ritual conversations. It didn’t involve anthropologists. Instead, we talked about the realizations we had come to at Harvard—mostly, that we had grown up and grown to appreciate people and ideas more. That we had changed much since freshman year and that we are, thanks to this place, ready to move on from Harvard but not from the people we talked with here.
Although I grew to love many things at Harvard over the years, I loved most the conversations I had with my friends, classmates, housemates, tutors, teaching fellows, and professors. Every conversation I had helped me think—about mothers in China and daughters in Russia, about the bonds between people and between molecules. I thought about new ideas and old ideas in new ways. Maybe the value of having conversations is obvious even to freshmen, but it can’t be fully appreciated until the end of senior year, when one has grown as much as one can in this place. Only then can one recognize how conversations turn Harvard into a home that helps carry us to our future homes, physical and metaphorical.
That realization became clear to me in the conversation I had before writing this piece. My friend told me how not so long ago in China, a bride about to get married would get carried on a sedan from her house to the house of her in-laws. The people paid to hold the bride ensured that her feet would not touch the ground, lest her soul wander between her former house and the house she hadn’t yet reached and never find a home.
In going through Harvard, we students were carried, like the bride, through the classrooms to the diploma-awarding ceremony and to our new homes. The metaphorical bride-bearers are the physical people with whom we’ve talked, who have made us develop our ideas by explaining them, and made us challenge our beliefs by reconsidering them. They are the students who made me think about the strategy of writing daily or the assumptions behind political science.
Such conversations have allowed some of us to touch ground on the doorsteps of a professional school or a consulting firm—our new homes—but not all of us can see the door of our home-to-be. We, the latter group of people, have to keep our feet pointed upward like those of the bride, safe from the dark earth below and from the rose-colored clouds above—from being weighed down by negativity or propelled toward illusory hopes.
When my feet neither hit the ground nor dangle in the air, but point upward, I have time to reflect on my journey. I cannot navel gaze—because that would hurt my head—nor can I be oblivious to the dangers along the road, but I can recognize the voices of the people who are carrying me. Like the chatter between bride-bearers that enabled the bride to appreciate them for carrying meat—so that the tigers would not devour her—the conversations I’ve had enable me to appreciate the people who shared their knowledge with me so that my ideas would not falter. In other words, I could not argue about social networks if I hadn’t discussed “Bowling Alone” with my classmates.
Like the bride-bearers, the people who spoke with me at Harvard led me to multiple new people and ideas, even though it was not their official job to do so. If I had only had one deep conversation on any given topic, it would not have introduced me to enough ideas to help me develop my arguments. I acknowledge that.
Each person I met also allowed me to build the trust I needed to be carried along to a safe harbor. Each conversation with one professor gave me the courage and trust to speak with another professor. No Harvard experience is complete without such connections.
For some students, leaving Harvard—sometimes with a check in hand—will be like getting a divorce settlement, but I will always carry this place with me, even if I don’t think of it consciously. Like the bride being carried among the fields, I don’t know what the world outside of my old home will look like. I don’t know what it’s like to pay the rent or cook several meals a day, but I trust that the hands that have held me up will help me get to the new place I hope I’ll grow to love, because the people who supported me or pushed my ideas forward are the ones who have enabled me to move on from Harvard.
In a Chinese restaurant in Cambridge, I sat with my friend and laughed as I finally used chopsticks to transfer dumplings onto my plate. She taught me that, too. I hope to take that metaphorical dumpling away with me on my journey to my new home, its warm contents accumulating in my stomach like the satisfaction of knowing that these people and this place will not let me fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The first thing I received from Harvard following my decision to attend was a number. After the cookies and glossy brochures of the collegiate wooing process, the transition to being just an undifferentiated entry in the university’s master database seemed rather abrupt.
The whole time I’ve been at Harvard, I’ve never heard anyone else recall this experience, much less associate with it any sort of unease or irony. Many will note, however, that the stereotypical Harvard experience rests in coping with the transition from being incredibly special in high school to being indistinct among so many special others in college.
The way I see it, many of us spend our college experience trying to get back to where we started: to being distinct and proud—a name, not just a number. The quest often involves building up résumés that demonstrate not just that an individual belongs, but that he stands above his surroundings even here.
The desired effect is called status, and it’s an unusual social necessity in that its distribution really is a zero-sum game, at least when everybody’s keeping score by the same rules.
The game’s essential elements, though, leave its rulebook remarkably open to variation when played in different settings.
Studying abroad in Delhi for the fall semester of my junior year, I got to see from an outsider’s point of view the status-seeking competition of a top university. My host institution, St. Stephen’s College of Delhi University, is known as one of India’s most rigorous and prestigious non-technical schools. Seats not reserved for lower castes or other minorities often go to representatives of the North Indian urban elite who master the competitive entrance examination process.
The particular rules of the game as played in such a venue yielded countless surprises: Students found out who had gotten management-consulting interviews, for instance, on a sheet posted on the college’s cluttered daily announcement board rather than via e-mail. Exam scores, too, were publicly available to all. The conventional path for graduates seemed to tilt toward applying to all available master’s programs and selecting one’s best acceptance—hopefully abroad—rather than doing the same with finance or consulting jobs as might be more typical here.
Entering such a setting as an outside observer provides a new perspective on the apparent ridiculousness of some status-determining customs in a closed system. Exam questions at St. Stephen’s, for instance, came from a short list approved 20 years ago by the central University of Delhi administration: Students pre-prepared long strands of factual regurgitation by photocopying and memorizing past students’ answers. But even more than a custom’s ridiculousness, the outside perspective allows one to synthesize the way in which an insider glimpses such ridiculousness and yet works within the rules nonetheless. Most of us know we are at Harvard in part because of high scores on a test—the SAT—that can so obviously be “gamed” that it has renounced a previous claim to measure “aptitude” and claims only to measure the “achievement” of taking a test well.
The upshot, however, is that the fundamental status contest is the same in each place, and the game’s conventions are arbitrary. The options at Harvard for charting a future path, choosing a field of study, or even balancing extra-curricular activities with unstructured time present themselves within certain constraints—rules of the game—that would not always make sense to those viewing from an outside frame of reference. Take, for instance, the incredulity outside the “Harvard bubble” at attempts to explain that going into finance is viewed here as a form of keeping one’s options open and a non-ideological choice.
It’s only in going abroad that I learned to view the customs of the game as it is played here as diverging interpretations of the same social impulse seen at Stephen’s. Subtracted from their grounding assumptions, I can admit that the constraints I take as fixed and the choices I make within them—in seeking to establish myself as an individual and distinct person—would often look just as arbitrary as do those of distant others.
Many Harvard students speak of going abroad as an item they wish they’d gotten to on their list of things to do in college. The percentage who actually spend a full term abroad, though, barely pushes double digits. It may often have left me feeling like nothing beyond a more invasive tourist, but studying elsewhere taught me to take that tourist’s eye to my own surroundings in a way that no stack of books on deconstructing social norms can compel.
It reminded me that college is not all about asking how to play the game, but about questioning why we play it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is easy to feel unaccomplished here. There’s always someone more accomplished at Harvard—someone with better LSAT scores, someone with a higher thesis grade, someone with a better reference to Kant in Justice section. But, more importantly, it can be difficult to figure out just what accomplishment really is. We knew we’d achieved something when we got in here. Today, as we leave, it’s a little more difficult to know what it is we’re supposed to be doing.
For past generations coming of age, the large questions and challenges were more obvious. For our grandparents’ generation, World War II provided an existential struggle to which each man and woman could find a way to contribute. In the post-War era, the tendency to break down the world into simple dichotomies—free vs. communist, high-brow vs. low-brow—made defining one’s path easy. For our parents’ generation, the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement similarly served to divide and define—you were for Civil Rights and against the war, or you weren’t, but either way you knew where you stood. The clothes they wore, the drugs they used or refused, the colors of their friends’ faces, and the music they listened to all gave our parents’ lives definition. You were either hip or you weren’t.
Today, we have few of these obvious signposts to guide us. What we are supposed to do is not obvious, and often is not even remotely apparent.
But there is something unique and exciting about the time in which we’ve grown up. The ’90s were the single greatest era of peace, stability, and prosperity in American history. We had no major struggles, no rivals, no crises, no questions. Sure, our Tamagachis died on us, our Pogs collections failed to impress on the playground, and our responsibly homemade lunches never did quite compare to the cool kids with the Dunkaroos and Lunchables. But the decade presented no problems that seemed unsolvable. Then came the aughts, in which the stability, safety, and simplicity of the ’90s was flipped on its head. The facades of our failed institutions were torn down, revealing one sham after another—the dotcom crash, the housing crisis, Enron, Katrina.
This combination of decades has left us disillusioned and scared. We’ve been shown that safety and stability are fleeting—a reasonable reaction to the time that has shaped us. And given this attitude, it seems natural that we should flock to institutions of stability. Career tracks like banking, medicine, consulting, or even Teach for America, which offer clear hierarchies, defined processes for application and advancement, and steady pay, appeal to our generation to a degree never before seen.
There’s nothing wrong with our best and brightest minds applying themselves to the complex problems of finance and business, to life-saving tasks of medicine, or to the lives-changing job of teaching. But there are fewer of these jobs available today. Many of us who once would have gone into these areas are now faced with the uncomfortable reality of graduating into a recession. The sources of comfort, stability, and safety that so many of us have sought out have become more inaccessible.
But this apparent lack of opportunity is, in fact, an opportunity in itself. For those of us lucky enough not to see a certain tomorrow, we face an incredible opportunity: For the first time in our lives, the future is not laid out for us in applications and course catalogues.
As Harvard students, we are in a unique position—we cannot really fail. Of course, we will all fail at some point; we’ll fail to win a girl’s love, to earn a promotion, to gain access to the right law school, just as we failed to maintain membership in all 25 of our extracurricular activities from the freshman activities fair, or as we failed by getting that B-minus once.  But these are not real failures. These are hiccups. We’ve been blessed with enough talent and luck to gain the advantage of a Harvard degree, which, going forward, will allow us to try, fail, and get back up. Of course, we can fail at any one endeavor. But we’ll always be able to get back up. This is the great blessing of a Harvard education.
This is also the great American blessing. The United States has always been a country that welcomes in and rewards those who try, who venture down untraveled paths, who wander, who fail. That our generation today doesn’t seem to have a well-defined purpose means that we have the opportunity and the responsibility to seek out new questions and challenges. Our generation will find greatness not because of people performing well in the jobs that already exist but because of people exploring new paths that have never been tried before. Our dual blessings—to be in America at this moment and to be Harvard graduates at this moment—give us the chance to embrace this instability.
What I ask is that we keep our eyes open. As a generation we don’t have a good sense of where we’re going or what we are supposed to be doing. That’s all right, for now. But the way forward will not always be obvious, certainly not as obvious as it was when we opened acceptance letters four years ago or when we were offered a job four months ago. Our successes have conditioned us to not seek out opportunities. And this has left us afraid to seek out our purposes, as individuals and as a generation. But there’s no grading rubric for life, no automatic B-plus for just showing up.
Naming generations is a tricky project. Jack Kerouac was successful in naming his Beat Generation, but few others have been able to give their own generation a lasting moniker. The Baby Boomers—our parents—were given their name before they had done much more than arrive. The Greatest Generation—our grandparents—only got that label decades after they had earned it. Some have tried to call our generation a “Lost Generation,” echoing Gertrude Stein, who coined the term in reference to the original Lost Generation of the 1920s.
A fear of becoming a “Lost Generation” may not be unreasonable.  But we are not lost, not exactly. We simply don’t know where we’re going yet. And that’s just fine. We’d do well to remember that not all those who wander are lost.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If someone told me during my cadet years at West Point that I would fall in love with Harvard and have warm friendship and regard for its current students, it would have been amazing data to process. For one thing, it would have meant that I would make it through Vietnam, a pretty good—and certainly not guaranteed—outcome.
In retrospect, however, it is not surprising that the chapters of my life when I was a soldier and when I attended Harvard Business School are connected. Harvard, after all, has always played an instrumental role in protecting this nation.
Soldiers have historically been considered to be highly valued students for the University’s investment. President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 personally saw to it that the name of an applicant from the war zone got “sent to the right quarters,” so that Bruns Grayson ’74 became the only Rhodes Scholar who served in Vietnam before college.
When I had the signal opportunity to chair construction of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C.,  Harvard graduates ensured that amidst the huge ten-year controversy its construction continued without fail. Each Harvard alumnus who participated gave hundreds of hours of devotion and time. The Atlantic Monthly Editor James M. Fallows ’70, a former President of The Harvard Crimson, in two hours wrote and placed an op-ed in the Washington Post to blow the whistle on an egregious move by opponents of the design. People with connections to Harvard were numerous among those who made the wall possible.
Harvard’s professors also contribute to our armed forces in a decisive way. In defense lanes, I found myself working with Professor Matthew S. Meselson; it is little known that his work led directly to the still-standing U.S. policy to forego all use of biological weapons. He still works devotedly as teacher, scientist, and friend to public servants. Samuel R. Williamson parsed foreign policy and the causes of war for us rookies in the Pentagon. He still does.
Though historically rooted, the ties between Harvard and our nation’s armed forces have been called into question lately, given the University’s 42 years of insistence that the Reserve Officer Training Corps cannot have a place on campus.  I believe that Crimson editorial writer Brian J. Buldoc ’10’s opinion piece supporting lifting the ban spots the main obstacle: among faculty members, antipathy for the military is concomitant to the ban. In talks with Harvard students and graduates in last winter, I found that the majority favor lifting the ban on ROTC; they, and I, feel that the ban makes a negative statement about those in the military now, stigmatizing young officers for the sake of trying to combat the stigma that faces gay military personnel.
I find that among gay military personnel there is little or no desire to injure fellow military. The view is that the case is for Congress to decide and is not the fault of young people who are either currently in the military or are committed to join after college. When Harvard refuses to allow ROTC on campus, it sends the message that service to one’s country is not a priority. At its core, Harvard’s ban “blames the warrior” for a policy issue. That is the same mistake the ban originally made in 1968, when ROTC was removed from campus as the result of protests against the war in Vietnam. Among those of us in the military on campus then, there was a sting of personal rejection that  is still felt by ROTC candidates now.
But our country has moved beyond “blaming the soldier” for issues of policy. Our country needs the best that Harvard has to offer in a new century of grave threats. Our country needs the Harvard of Elliot L. Richardson ’41, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., class of 1861, and Robert Gould Shaw.
Commencement and the coming weeks are a fitting time to join with President Obama, to speak and act to end the ban on ROTC, and to affirm the message to all students and to our country that Harvard will always stand with our military in serving the nation.

When Scott Brown was elected to the Senate in January, President Obama noted, “Here’s my assessment of not just the vote in Massachusetts, but the mood around the country: The same thing that swept Scott Brown into office swept me into office.” The public is unhappy with the status quo and is looking to new people and new modes of political organization that can embody and effect democratic change. Clearly the traditional models—oriented around the state or the market—have been incomplete. Participatory democracy offers us a solution that goes beyond the traditional dichotomy.
Through much of the 20th century, individuals and groups that were committed to social justice tended to orient their campaigns around the issue of economic redistribution. There was a strong sense that poverty and extreme inequality were detrimental to citizens’ participation in social life. In terms of this dimension of social development, theorists and policy-makers over the last generation have debated the role of state versus market-oriented development.
One of the arguments used by the advocates of market deregulation has been that the level of economic output has to increase in order to have enough goods to re-distribute. This line of reasoning continues with the assertion that since state intervention was presumed to distort market activity, there was a need to substantially reduce regulation in all sectors. It goes without saying that the limitations of this argument have come to the foreground in the context of the recent financial crisis.
In contrast to both the state administrators supported by traditional Keynesians and the entrepreneurs favored by economic libertarians, contemporary innovators of redistribution emphasize the role of the public as a third actor in shaping economic life. One example that they often point to is the participatory budgetary process of the city of Porto Alegre in Brazil. The process, which was first implemented in 1989, encouraged all citizens to take part in constructing the city’s budget. Over the past two decades, thousands of citizens have participated annually in formulating the municipality’s economic priorities.
The city has utilized the participatory budget process since 1989, and there have been clearly progressive social effects: The number of schools has quadrupled since 1986; Porto Alegre’s health and education budget increased from 13 percent in 1985 to almost 40 percent in 1996; sewer and water connections in the city of Porto Alegre went up from 75 percent of total households in 1988 to 98 percent in 1997. The number of participants in the budget process grew from less than 1,000 per year in 1990 to more than 16000 in 1998 and is presently around 40000.
Additionally, the influential Brazilian business journal “Exame” has regularly nominated Porto Alegre as the Brazilian city with the best quality of life based on the following indicators: “literacy, enrollment in elementary and secondary education, quality of higher and postgraduate education, per capita consumption, employment, child mortality, life expectancy, number of hospital beds, housing, sewage, airports, highways, crime rate, restaurants, and climate.” The success of this innovative budget process has made Porto Alegre a model for an alternative form of economic distribution.
The proposal for a participatory budget process destabilizes the standard conception of the political debate: Conservatives who advocate for more market versus progressives who advocate for more state. The participatory budget process implicitly suggests that both the market and the state have to be supervised by the broader public. Simply having the market discipline the state or the state regulate the market does not solve the more profound need for the public to have the capacity to shape social decisions without those choices distorted by the excesses of economic shortsightedness or bureaucratic centralization. Participatory budgeting offers us a solution that goes beyond the traditional dichotomy.
This novel methodology is also innovative at a personal level: Participatory democracy in Porto Alegre is “expressive” in the sense that it gives each individual the opportunity to collectively articulate his or her own original contribution to society. Rather than imagine democracy simply as a rationalized process, the citizens of the city perceive democracy to be a form of self-fulfillment: The public is given the opportunity to express its ingenuity, experience, and knowledge by tackling the most important questions that society faces. The implicit philosophy is that through the process of public deliberation each individual embodies his or her desire to be an agent, not a spectator in social life; participation in political life expresses the innate desire in every individual to play a role in shaping their society. This new generation of Harvard graduates has the opportunity to expand our democratic imagination by learning from the achievements of Porto Alegre and finding new ways of directly engaging the public in political and economic life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last June, shortly after the French Communist Deputy André Gérin launched the idea for a parliamentary commission on the burka, a Parisian journalism student went in search of the controversial article of clothing. The quest ended in failure: From the cosmopolitan neighborhood of Barbès to that of Belleville, shopkeepers repeatedly insisted that, while they sold plenty of headscarves and the occasional niqab, no clients had ever sought to purchase a burka.
As the journalist learned, this term, which has for the past decade symbolized women’s oppression by intolerant Islam, is a misnomer for the “integral veils” that are now being legally targeted in France, not to mention Belgium and Italy as well. Although pointed to by politicians as a dangerous new social problem, the practice is extremely rare. Even those who speak in favor of banning what the proposed law calls “public facial dissimulation” admit that the phenomenon is extremely marginal. Initial government intelligence reports named 367 documented cases. And, according to the Ministry of the Interior, no more than 2,000 women in France wear an “integral veil.” But for Gérin and others, these numbers are just the “tip of the iceberg.”
Ever since the parliamentary commission issued its report in January 2010, however, one is hard-pressed to open a French newspaper without seeing a totally veiled visage. Socially marginal as it may be, the integral veil has come to occupy considerable public and political space. What “iceberg” has all this public and political attention revealed?
For advocates of the ban, women who wear integral veils are simultaneously victims and perpetrators. They represent a surreptitious (if at the same time excessively visible) threat, namely the insidious spread of radical, Salafist Islam—and hence a religious and implicitly political menace. The proposed ban targets the practice as fundamentally at odds with French republican principles: both secularism and a (historically recent) commitment to gender equality. The new law thus seems, at first glance, to be a logical— and legal—extension of the commitments outlined in a 2004 law on “laïcité” that outlawed all “ostensible” religious symbols from public schools. In other words, six years ago it was the headscarf, now it is the burka. Then it was public schools, now it is public space.
In fact, this new legislative proposal represents a significant departure from the previous law and a disturbing radicalization of French political tactics. The responses of jurists to the government’s proposed legislation make it very clear: The “burka ban” does not uphold the principles of French republican law—it overtly violates them.
Framed as a matter of church/state separation, or “laïcité,” the 2004 law’s sphere of application was heavily circumscribed: It was limited to public schools and it applied to subjects (presumptively victimized young girls) who were legally minor. While the subject of significant debate, both at the time and since, the 2004 law was nonetheless upheld as conforming to the principles of the French Constitution and to the European Convention on Human Rights, in part because it was framed in universal terms. The same cannot be said for the proposed law on the integral veil. The Conseil d’Etat, which provides legal guidance to the executive and serves as France’s highest administrative court, has twice raised serious doubts about the constitutionality of this new law. After all, the women who wear “integral veils” are, by the Ministry of the Interior’s own admission, consenting adults who do so of their own volition. “Laïcité” is not applicable either, because the law targets a legally nebulous conception of public space, rather than specific state institutions. The Council of Europe’s Commissioner of Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, has likewise condemned the proposed law, stating: “The interdiction of the burka or the niqab would not liberate oppressed women, but could, on the contrary, exacerbate their exclusion in European societies.” The French League of Human Rights, while critical of the practice of “veiling,” is also opposed to the passage of the law.
Government officials have overtly flouted these (non-binding) legal opinions, and they have set out to remedy what they view as a lacuna in existing French republican law. There is here a notable paradox: These politicians want to breach existing statutes (on the preservation of “human dignity,” “gender equality,” and even of public order) so as to better uphold them. In doing so, they hope to demonstrate the extent (and integrity) of their “republican” commitments by specifically targeting a very small group of devout women. But this law, far from being universalist, has a particularized and particularizing intent. In the name of gender equality, it wants to save these women—from themselves.
According to Prime Minister François C. A. Fillon, however, “One must assume the juridical risks of one’s convictions.” President Nicolas P.S. Sarkozy thus clarified the “republican” principles that are supposed to undergird this law before the Council of Ministers on May 19: “We are an old nation, which is assembled around a certain idea of the dignity of the person, and in particular, the woman’s dignity, around a certain idea of living together. The integral veil that totally hides the face represents an attack on those values, which are so fundamental, so essential to the republican contract.” Sarkozy’s statement clearly invokes the language of human and, especially, women’s rights. But it is very difficult to discern exactly whose—and especially which women’s—“dignity” this law actually preserves.
In sum, the political instrumentalization of the “integral veil” indeed reveals the growth of a disturbing public presence: a strident French nationalism which upholds woman’s bodily dignity as a core value and ideal, but only at the expense of actual women’s volition, agency, and legal rights. That is the real iceberg that looms beneath this law.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the days when the work upon my back has weighed like the world upon Atlas, the façade of Widener Library, looming closer with each step, has often seemed to be opening its palatial, ravenous jaws to swallow me whole for untold hours. Other days, particularly in winter when the icy wind rips through Tercentenary Theater and Widener’s windows exude a warm, promising glow, walking into the library is like entering a warm embrace. Whether monstrous or motherly, it is this fickle-tempered friend that has nonetheless been a constant presence in my four years at Harvard.
As with entering any foreign landscape, in those early freshman days I did not feel so comfortable in the impressive marble halls of the cornerstone of the Harvard library system. Reading the sign next to the entrance to Loker Reading Room that sternly stated “Readers only,” I thought I could neither use my computer nor text from my phone. It was easy, then, to understand those who claimed that Widener was too intimidating, or too imposing, to work in. My first time in the stacks, for instance, in a sleep-deprived stupor after a particularly late night, I wandered through the miles of bookshelves for half an hour trying to find my way out, a panic rising within me as images of my body rotting away somewhere deep flashed through my mind.
But despite the terror inspired in that moment and the initial intimidation of “reading” in Loker, I continued to be lured back by such a majestic setting to complete such a commonplace task as studying. In all the hours I have since spent in that library, I have found that Widener demands of its visitors the patience to get to know it, so that its seemingly impersonal character might become hospitable and welcoming.
Widener’s depths contain untold pleasures of both the intellectual and physical variety. The collective shuffling of papers in Loker assumes a calming, background hum, and the chairs in the third floor poetry reading room are perfectly designed for napping. It is easy to find and hold in your hands books that are over a hundred years old. For me, discovering a first edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “This Side of Paradise,” one of my all time favorites, in the stacks level 2E was a moment of sublime excitement. And whenever I walk through the stacks and pick up the well-worn books or sit in the reading rooms and work, I cannot help but think of the brilliant minds and powerful people who have walked by those shelves, sat in those chairs, and held in their hands those books before.
During the course of the past year, Widener also came to be the temple of my thesis. The ritual of writing always began with a visit to the replica of Harry Elkins’s home reading room between the first and second floors. As I would cross the threshold of the marble antechamber, I breathed deeply that distinct change in smell, the sweetness evocative of aged pages, and felt the cooler, quieter atmosphere envelope me. In that life’s heart of the library, there the Gutenberg would light up before me, there Harry’s portrait hung above the fireplace, there his books remained lovingly preserved, there stood the vase of fresh flowers continually renewed.
Over entire days spent in Widener in the pursuit of my solitary thesis study, I watched the ebb and flow of people around me, the belly of the beast swelling to capacity in the early afternoon hours, dwindling around dinnertime at six, and emptying by closing at ten. Over the course of weeks, I came to know my fellow Widener devotees by their study habits, their preferred seats, and sometimes by their propensity toward flatulence. And if I found myself in Loker alone at the end of the night, as happened on a few occasions, I took advantage of the chance to fulfill the tempting desire to run, skip, dance through that great long aisle of tables that had always seemed to scream to me for play.
Now that my thesis is done, and I have completed all of my academic requirements for graduation, it feels weird to return to those white marble halls. What purpose do I have there now? It feels like being there will never be the same, and that I have lost something once of importance.
I wonder if, with time, I will forget—my preferred seat in the library, where my favorite section of books is, how it feels to be a student studying through the bitter cold reading period, or working hour upon hour on my senior thesis between runs to J.P. Licks for a free sample of ice cream and a large Earl Grey tea. Already the ghosts of faded experience fill Widener’s halls and surroundings, swirled about in my memory with a thousand other impressions.
I fear that perhaps, as more ghosts crowd in, the definition of my experience of Herr Widener will dissolve. But then maybe I catch a whiff of a smell that calls back those aged books in the stacks, and I remember the touch of their pages and the rustle of papers in Loker and the echo that my boots made walking over the uncarpeted marble floors, and it all feels much closer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
These days, everyone is saying it—Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn say it, The Nike Foundation’s “Girl Effect” campaign says it, Goldman Sachs’ “10,000 Women” initiative says it: Educational initiatives for girls in the third world are the key to a successful international development strategy. As Harvard University President Emeritus Lawrence H. Summers observed years ago in a speech to a Development Economics Seminar at the World Bank, “When one takes into account all its benefits, educating girls yields a higher rate of return than any other investment available in the developing world.” A 2010 World Bank “News and Broadcast” article in honor of International Women’s Day corroborates Summers’ declaration, noting that a “one-year increase in the schooling of all adult females in a country is associated with an increase in GDP per capita of around $700.” Today, 18 years after Summers’ speech, the question is no longer whether girls’ education in the developing world is an economically valuable cause, but rather how to best affect change within this sector.
In the past year, celebrities like Oprah G. Winfrey and Madonna have come under fire for the elaborate girls’ secondary schools they have built in South Africa and Malawi respectively; grassroots activists assert that, in building such western-style schools, both women fall short of maximizing their potential for change. Unsurprisingly, celebrities and corporations capable of undertaking large-scale projects such as these “leadership academies” turn up their noses at the more localized efforts of these same grass-roots critics. Such antagonism is at once unnecessary and counter-productive. Each type of school affects a very different, though equally necessary, kind of change.
Schools like Oprah’s Leadership Academy of South Africa operate on a top-down theory of change. They equip their graduates to act on the national and even international stage by guaranteeing tertiary education. In short, they prepare their students to be extraordinary. Oprah communicates such a mission to every viewer of her website before they can even click on the “mission” tab. The following series of questions greets every viewer of the school’s website: “How many Rosa Parks or Marie Curies have we lost to poverty? How many Maya Angelous or Sandra Day O’Connors never had a chance to learn? How many Toni Morrisons or Mother Theresas lost hope because of abuse or neglect?” Such overtures underscore the school’s mission to serve as a training ground for national and global female leaders.
Schools built by small, grass-roots NGOs operate on the inverse theory of change, striving to revolutionize the local status quo rather than affect national or global change. Usually rural instead of urban and almost always consistent with government standards, schools built by organizations like Achieve-in-Africa, BuildAfrica, Ripple Africa, and Schools-for-Africa are intensely local, both in terms of curriculum and culture. Such schools do not guarantee a college education; they simply equip girls to maximize their impact in their hometowns by holding jobs outside the home and ensuring the education of the next generation of girls. In doing so, these schools afford women new economic value in their local communities and animate a bottom-up theory of change.
Ultimately, thinking of girls’ education as the most effective investment option in the developing world helps justify the need for both types of change using basic economic theory. Just as any good stockbroker takes care to diversify each of her portfolios, American philanthropists as a group are wise to pursue both the “Leadership Academy” and the “Local Village School” models. Within this philanthropic portfolio, the leadership academy functions as a venture investment—expensive, risky, but with the potential to pay unprecedented dividends. Such potential is attached to a small number of graduates and hinges on the expectation that each graduate will affect real change in her native country. On the other hand, the smaller, more localized school is akin to a safe stock: By partnering with local people and government, these schools guarantee that their graduates will be accepted into, and strengthen, the local economic community over their lifetimes. Although the individual-based “return” on this type of investment may be small, it is constant and easily replicable.
As counterintuitive as it may seem, these two methods of educating girls in the developing world are complementary rather than contrary. Both the risky and the safe, the top-down and the bottom-up, the leadership academy and the village school are necessary to affect meaningful change in the developing world, be it economic or otherwise.

Defending his nomination of former Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, President Obama has studiously avoided the “e-word” that got him into so much trouble in the past: empathy. As a candidate, and then again when he nominated Sonia M. Sotomayor, Obama listed empathy among the most important virtues a justice could possess. His opponents insisted that the term could only be code for an “activist” judge, which in turn is code for a left-wing judge. But to understand Obama’s insistence on empathy, we need to consider the classic statement on the subject by an 18th-century author who is usually understood to stand on the right of the political spectrum: Adam Smith.
In October 2008, then-Senator Obama surprised many when he included two works by Adam Smith on a list of the books that most deeply influenced him. The question of whether “The Wealth of Nations” has been an inspiration for Obama’s response to our current economic troubles will have to be saved for another occasion. Smith’s other book, “The Theory of Moral Sentiments,” has had a more obvious effect on the president’s worldview.
Smith is an important source for Obama’s conviction that just and impartial judgment must be grounded in a sense of empathy for our fellow human beings. Although the president’s critics have insisted that justice must be blind and that empathy can only bias judicial opinions, Smith knew that justice would be an impossible ideal were human beings unable to share each other’s thoughts and feelings.
The word “empathy” was coined in the 20th century to describe our ability to feel our way into another’s point of view.  Smith called this ability “sympathy.” He saw every instance of sympathy as involving an implicit form of moral judgment. When empathetically engaging with the situation of others, we are led to imagine how we ourselves would react in their situation and don’t sympathize with reactions that are inappropriate. This is why sympathy can serve as the basis for our sense of right and wrong, what Smith called our “moral sentiments.”
Sentiments of justice involve what Smith called “divided sympathy,” in which multiple individuals with conflicting interests are the objects of our empathy. When two or more parties are in conflict, we must empathetically evaluate each of them. Only after having done so can we determine to what extent each has behaved properly toward the other. And only after that can we determine the principles of justice governing the case at hand.
Consider the famous scene in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” in which the slave trader Mr. Haley hunts down the heroine Eliza to regain the property that she stole from him. Although readers might conceivably sympathize with Haley as a victim of theft, we in fact only feel sympathy for Eliza. After all, the property she stole is her own five-year-old son. It is Haley, not Eliza, who is being unjust.
Smith goes on to argue that rules of justice can be generalized from our individual moral sentiments. We conclude that slavery is unjust from the fact that we sympathize not only with the fictional Eliza but with all those who really suffered under slavery. Our society can then be called just to the extent that the law reflects these general rules. When it fails to do so, the law needs to be changed. Smith was an outspoken opponent of slavery when legal systems around the globe still permitted it.
Admittedly, the role of judges is not to change the law but to interpret it. Yet every judicial opinion, if it is to be impartial, must empathetically consider the position of both sides of the case. Far from a source of bias, broad sympathies are the best protection against it. Without our ability to see the world from the perspectives of countless others and share their feelings when appropriate, impartial judgment would be impossible.
At Harvard, students and faculty alike pride themselves on their intelligence. But sheer intellect alone is never sufficient for sound moral, political, or legal judgment. We also need to cultivate a wide-ranging imagination, emotional sensitivity, and all the other empathetic capacities of the human heart and mind. There is much debate as to whether these non-rational abilities can be taught in the classroom. What clearly can be taught, however, is the tremendous importance of empathy in human life—a fact recognized by 18th-century philosophers and 21st-century neuroscientists alike.
For the past three years, I have been proud to teach both of Adam Smith’s great books to a selection of Harvard’s brightest students in Social Studies 10. Each year, I wondered who among them might end up on the Supreme Court, or even in the presidency. My hope is that, when they attain positions of power, they remember what Smith had to teach them, not only about economics, but also about empathy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m no Adam B. Wheeler. I’ve never written a book, I don’t have a 4.00, and I didn’t win a Hoopes prize junior year. I’ve never been invited to lecture on anything, anywhere, nor can I speak five languages. In fact, my grade point average is far from stellar, I can’t name an academic prize I was even considered for, and other than a few French phrases I pull out mostly for comedic value, I stick to my native tongue. Like I said, I’m no Wheeler. To be fair, though, neither is he.
Still, I think I can understand why Wheeler did it, why he fabricated an academic history worthy of a university president. Even though his resume has significantly more padding than most, one can imagine that there are a few resumes floating out there among the Harvard senior class that do look quite similar to Wheeler’s work of art. As we have been told ad nauseum, the students here at Harvard are incredible and have the credentials to prove it—prizes, published works, and scholarships out the wazoo. But I am not one of those students, and neither was Wheeler. And with Commencement upon me, I am starting to wonder if I should have tried harder to be one—applied myself more in the classroom, stayed in Lamont longer, and maybe even given up Tequila Tuesdays.
Looking over old syllabi, I find readings I wish I had done, classes I wish I had gone to, professors I wish I had gotten to know. A part of me thinks, “Well, if these things really were important to me, I would have done them! Priorities are revealed in actions.” But I would be hard pressed to argue that watching the same episode of Family Guy three times was more important or a better use of my time than going to a molecular and cellular biology lecture. The next time around, be it in graduate school or the workplace, I will make more of a conscious effort to choose hard work over Hulu.
As almost-graduates, we have been told to ignore our regrets. What’s done is done! You made it through! That’s an accomplishment in itself! That’s true, and graduating from Harvard in one piece is an important achievement. But the regrets that we have now, on the eve of our entrance into the real world, should not be completely cast aside. They give us insight into ourselves—what we value and why—and can prove instructive in the years ahead.
Yet, even though regret does have its purpose, it is important not to dwell on it. Spending too much time thinking of the could-haves, would-haves, should-haves can cloud the real progress one has made. Overall, I, along with the vast majority of my classmates, am proud of the time I have spent here, enamored with the friends I have made, and warmed by the memories of Harvard I will always carry. But I don’t feel guilty for harboring a few regrets, because there is a lot to learn from them. And I think Adam Wheeler, though he is probably facing a whole different set of regrets right now, would agree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In case of a fire alarm take only your exam copy and exam booklets. Proceed to the closest exit and assemble at [designated meeting location]. Stay together but do not discuss the exam. Keep your exam booklets closed.”
By the time you graduate from Harvard, you have heard these words at least a dozen times. As the litany of rules are read—from bathroom breaks to going “incommunicado” to University Health Services—we never pay attention.
In the minutes preceding my last exam at Harvard though, I began to imagine...
The fire alarm goes off in the Science Center, and one-by-one, the 250 people in my class have their attentions pulled away from the behavior of eukaryotic cells. The head TF gets on the microphone, “Everyone keep your exams with you and head to your nearest exit.” And still, everyone remains calm as they slowly head up the aisles—a few people are still working.
When the first group reaches the doors, they open them to find the Science Center literally ablaze (something involving the Indian food at the Greenhouse Café). As rafters fall from the ceiling, and freshman start taking cellphone pictures of a melting MacBook, I try to make my way out of the building, pausing occasionally to try and help a fellow classmate. The whole time I’m thinking—“If only I didn’t have this goddamn exam booklet in my hand.” I look around me to see others waving their burning tests like Fourth of July sparklers and struggling to save themselves with only one free hand. Somehow, we all make it out alive, and Gawker has a field day with it. Under media scrutiny, Harvard finally has no excuse but to build a real student union atop the ashes of the Science Center.
I snap out of my daydream 30 minutes into my final, but keep thinking...
In many ways, this pseudo-amputee circus has come to be a symbol for everything I see as awful (and admirable) about Harvard. No matter what time of day or setting, Harvard encourages a culture where its students must have the proverbial exam booklet in their hands at all times. It starts with issues like the emphasis of grade point average and the disincentive for academic risk taking, and it ends with a handicapped, competitive groping toward the models of Success and Glory.
To begin with, Harvard has been overall unsuccessful in its attempts to provide a liberal-arts education. The burden of unexciting, core survey courses combined with fairly strict and rigorous concentration requirements provide for very little room to truly experiment. On top of this, the cutthroat environment around letter grades and GPA, which is perhaps unwittingly fostered by departments, the administration, and the Office of Career Services, ensures that even if we do test uncharted waters, we won’t really have the courage to do anything with it. Our hands are full—or at least one is.
Just literally, if you’re missing a hand, it makes a lot of things difficult, especially building something from scratch. Without that extra hand, Harvard students fumble their own imaginations. As a result, creativity exists at Harvard but only in trace amounts. With that exam booklet always in hand, most people only have time to create a persona rather than their masterpieces. We get walking, talking works-of-art rather than artists. We all have things to say, but even the best fall victim to the environment and the little Type-A sixth grader huddled inside their souls. For this, I’ll blame Harvard:
When I’ve gone to OCS to talk about jobs in arts/entertainment/media, the response I usually get is like when I was nine and told my parents I wanted to play in the NBA with Michael Jordan—“Oh, I’m sure you could, sweetheart.” Yes, Harvard has Visual and Environmental Studies, creative theses, literature magazines, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, but this comes nowhere close to meeting demand on campus, especially compared to resources for non-humanities and finance. Harvard has implicitly stifled creativity while not fostering it in those who are willing to take the risk.
Perhaps the worst part of our handicapped environment is how little Harvard focuses on undergraduate extracurricular life—and how that translates into the way we treat each other. The lack of student free-space (coupled with the constant bad weather), the bad dining hall food, the lack of university-planned events, the lack of unique house identity, and aggressive dorm and drinking rules have placed the responsibility of Harvard’s social life in the hands of student-run extracurricular organizations and clubs. The result of all this is a derisive and dividing Culture of Exclusion through which students seclude themselves in autonomous micro-nations who are all at-odds with each other.
Harvard, loosen up, so that your students can do the same. Get rid of GPA incentives, the Core or Gen Ed, and make it easier for students to use their imaginations for things besides financial models. Make your students a real home-away-from-home where they have plenty of space to relax, and they don’t have to beg members of the Delphic for a beer. Let them leave the exam room without those meaningless pieces of paper when it’s all burning down. Because when we finally face the flames, whether that means incredible, unseen opportunity or unfortunate, life-questioning failure or just a lonely, great idea, we’re going to need both of our hands to make it through to the other side.

Mr. Increase Mather, class of 1656 and Harvard’s best president, once wrote, “A child carries a bundle up and down with him wherever he goes, and this bundle in his heart. But a bundle of what? Truly, a bundle of folly.” These words have described every Harvard class since they were written in 1695, but you guys—the class of 2010—have brought it to a new level. In short, you are the source of Harvard’s and world’s problems.
Over these Commencement days no doubt professors, family, and friends, all weak of heart, will congratulate you on a job well done. Not I. Just look at the job you have done at Harvard. You gobbled up $11 billion in stocks and hot breakfast. You lost us party grants. You did who-knows-what to the Wetu.
Harvard had dreams before you came. It dreamt of colonizing Allston with merciless engineering concentrators. It dreamt of building a science center out of stem cells. If you had not shown up, Harvard could have been a colder version of Stanford by now. But you did, Fortuna got angry, and now our red-spiced chicken is a little less spiced.
And that was just the Roman deities warming up. They continued to arrest Skip Gates, Ponzi-scheme America, and cancel Arrested Development. Not to mention childhood obesity. All because you seniors refuse to engage in human sacrifice. Are there any limits to the pain you have caused? Yes—I am not saying you are the ones responsible for making health care a pain in the butt to pass this year. Yale is responsible for that. But I am saying one of you must be a first-class sexual pervert because Providence has truly smitten us.
You seniors did not even start out as a good bunch. Within the first two years your fascination with premarital sex, underage drinking, and transferring from the Quad was unsafe. But then you magnified your perversions with Facebook stalking, checking the weather of places you have no business going to, and then more Facebook stalking. (Oddly enough, never Myspace stalking. Why?) Worst of all, some of you have started blogs, an action on par with public masturbation.
I admit that we held some high expectations for you seniors going in. You were supposed to resist traditional consulting to go into non-profit consulting. You were supposed to wrest the seat of power from old white men and give it to young white men. I was also expecting more of you to get fluent in Spanish. I guess I shouldn’t be mad, just disappointed.
There are two important pieces of advice that the Undergraduate Council and I would like to give you. The first is to view failure as an opportunity for learning. If you could learn even the tiniest bit from your colossal failures then the Valium black market in University Hall could be cut in half. Those guys really do try, but they are only human.
The second is to be popular. The Undergraduate Council has always been the most popular student group on campus. Ad-Board reform, the month of January off, 24-hour Lamont, chocolate milk in the dining halls, the 2 a.m. party deadline, $450,000 in student-group funding, the Standing Committee on Ethnic Studies, and organizing a big tailgate. These are all popular things that have made us popular. As a result our members have no problem getting accepted into our nation’s finest graduate programs and fellowships, and, more importantly, we tend to live longer.
So please take my advice, thank your family for giving you life’s greatest gift (which is either a Harvard education or unconditional love—your choice), and get out of here. Good riddance.

Harvard’s Chinese Language Program—built into one of the nation’s most preeminent by departing director Shengli Feng—will begin a search for a new director after receiving a rare authorization from the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Feng, a Chinese professor, announced this spring that he will leave Harvard at the end of this academic year for a tenure-track position at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Administrators in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilization had expressed concerns that in the current financial landscape, which led to a salary freeze and significantly reduced hiring last spring, FAS would not be able to replace the departing professor.
But East Asian Languages and Civilization Department Chair Wilt Idema said that the department ultimately did receive authorization to conduct a search.
The authorization for EALC—the department’s third in the past year—is one of only 41 faculty searches across FAS that was authorized this past semester, according to FAS Spokesperson Jeff Neal.
While FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said that the size of the Faculty will grow slightly in the coming year—a marked slow-down after a decade that saw the Faculty expand by nearly 20 percent—he acknowledged that he does not expect new faculty searches to keep pace with departures, leading to a halt in expansion.
But Diana Sorensen, the FAS divisional dean for the arts and humanities, wrote in an e-mailed statement that finding Feng’s replacement was among the division’s priorities.
Once authorized, searches can last over a year as the department identifies a candidate and receives approval for the person from administrators throughout a chain of command, ending with the president of the University.
In the meantime, Idema said, Senior Preceptor in Chinese Emily Hui-Yen Huang will oversee the program.
At the time of Feng’s departure, Idema said that filling Feng’s position is “extremely important” for the health of Harvard’s Chinese language offerings.
“[Feng’s] leaving is a great loss for Harvard,” said Yu Feng, Shengli Feng’s former college roommate and a former Chinese language preceptor at Harvard who now heads Brandeis’ Chinese language program. “This is really sad to say, but that’s true. You won’t find anyone who can really replace him.”
At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Feng said he plans to devote more energy to his scholarship than he currently can in the managerial post of director. Feng has also said that he will be better compensated in his new post than he has been at Harvard.

Harvard Hillel Executive Director Bernard Steinberg was recently honored with the Covenant Award—a prize celebrating Jewish educators who have impacted Jewish life by taking an innovative approach to education.
Sponsored by The Covenant Foundation—which aims to “recogniz[e] the diversity of strengths within the field of Jewish education in North America,” according to the organization’s website—the award is given to three people each year.
“My understanding of this award is embedded in the word ‘covenant.’ A covenant is a Jewish idea from the Bible, and its meaning has to do with the value of interdependence, the centrality of relationships, and commitment to purpose. So to me, my work at Harvard is all about those values and ideas, first and foremost with students,” Steinberg said.
Steinberg’s students praised his excellent work as both a teacher and a mentor.
“I know very few people who have worked so tirelessly, generously, and passionately to create excellence in the Jewish community, primarily through Jewish young people,” said Charles W. Herman, a former Graduate School of Education student who studied under Steinberg at the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies in Israel and has known Steinberg for 34 years.
In addition to working with students at Hillel, Steinberg also co-teaches the course “Moral Leadership: Self, Other, and Action” at the Harvard Kennedy School and serves on the faculty of the Wexner Heritage Foundation.
“He’s an educator, but he’s also a mentor, and he’s a mentor that speaks to the entire person,” said Chana M. Solomon-Schwartz ’06, who interacted with Steinberg during her time as president of Hillel.
“The things I’ve learned from him are as relevant in my Jewish life as they are in my professional life, how I approach my studies, and how I live my life overall,” she added.
Kennedy School Lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’67, one of Steinberg’s colleagues, echoed Solomon-Schwartz’s sentiments, noting that “it is this deep humanity, caring, and wisdom that informs all Bernie does. He thus illuminates not only with his inspiration, not only with his ideas, but, most of all, with his deeds. Is this not what excellence in Jewish education is all about?”

Alumni from the Classes of 1945, 1950, and 1960 have convened on campus to reminisce and reunite.
These graduates, celebrating their 65th, 60th, and 50th reunions, respectively, have been treated to lectures, meals, and entertainment since the celebrations began on Monday.
W. Richard Haddad ’60 said that he is enjoying seminars on topics such as health care policy and staying fit while aging.
“Harvard is the gold standard when it comes to reunions,” he said.
Stanley L. Gordon ’60 said that he was impressed by Monday night’s Classmates Cabaret, at which members of his class performed pieces ranging from bluegrass banjo to Germanic opera.
“I’m very impressed with the accomplishments [of my classmates],” Gordon said, pointing out graduates who have made “really major contributions” in fields ranging from science to politics.
“It’s just nice to refresh and recollect and sense how time passes,” Haddad said. “Reunions are bittersweet.”
“What is surprising is to see all your classmates,” Donald T. Wesling ’60 said. “They were unlined, gorgeous, lithe 18-year-olds. They’re recognizably the same people, but they have changed in their appearances so much.”
Gordon said that in some cases he has not recognized his erstwhile acquaintances. At lunch, he sat next to a man who lived two rooms away from him in Matthews Hall during their freshman year, but neither remembered the other.
“If they don’t have their name tag on, you could be walking by one of your best friends on the street and not recognize him,” he said. “There’s a certain sadness and poignancy to it.”
Others said that they have spent time “memorializing our departed friends,” according to Eric K. Petschek ’45.
Several alumni discussed the changes that have occurred at Harvard over the past half-century or more. Most notably, Harvard and Radcliffe have merged; Gordon said he was struck by this change when he heard University President Drew G. Faust state in a speech to alumni on Monday that some Harvard classes are now more than half female.
Gordon also noted that more Harvard students nowadays hail from public high schools, adding that there seems to be “more stress on athletics” today.
Haddad mentioned the changes to Harvard Square. “I’m sorry to see more chains,” he said. “It seems to have lost some of the character that I remember.”
“When they came in 1940, there were waiters and crystal in the dining halls,” Betty Petschek said about her husband’s class. “That changed when World War II started.”
Petschek—who served in the Navy and returned to finish his degree, like many of his classmates—said that the experience of World War II left a profound impact on his class.
“I think the whole class is very unified. They all had World War II experience,” Betty Petschek said.
The 25th, 35th, and 70th reunions begin today, and alumni celebrating their 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th reunions will join the revelry tomorrow.

Recently, the Harvard Kennedy School administration became increasingly concerned regarding the amount of study space available to its students.
In hopes of opening up more room for students, the Kennedy School has moved its administrative offices to 124 Mount Auburn Street and undergone a reorganization of its library.
In the early fall of 2009, the Kennedy School Student Government—taking into consideration feedback from HKS students—helped design a fast-tracked renovation project for the HKS Library, which was set to be completed in Jan. 2010. The organization’s goal was to alter library space to provide easier access to critical content.
In addition to increasing outlets and providing newer copiers, HKS turned about 40 percent of its library stack space into individual and group study space, according to Melodie L. Jackson, associate dean for communications and public affairs for HKS.
Because the HKS Library primarily houses more recently-published books—Widener and other Harvard libraries tend toward historic collections—HKS was able to create study space by weeding out books and journals. All books that were removed are no longer current and already available through other Harvard libraries, and all journals removed are available online or in stable repositories, according to Heather McMullen, director of library and knowledge services at HKS.
“We were very careful to retain older classic works, faculty publications, and any materials unique to Harvard,” McMullen wrote in an e-mail.
According to McMullen, the majority of the books weeded out were then donated to Better World Books, a for-profit organization that collects books and sells them online to raise money for literacy initiatives.
Any books that Better World Books did not accept were donated to Got Books, which donates and sells books overseas and to educators through its affiliates to prevent books from turning into waste.
The HKS Library also donated print journals to the East Coast Exchange program, which allows libraries to fill gaps in their journal collections.
The new furniture, which will provide a net gain of 36 seats, is expected to arrive next week, according to McMullen.
“We’re continuing to seek more opportunities to provide students with space,” Jackson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gu-Yeon Wei, an electrical engineering professor who focuses on designing efficient electronic circuits, has been granted tenure in the School of Engineering and Applied Science.
Colleagues and students said they were delighted to hear that Wei, who has worked at Harvard since 2002, had been named a Gordon McKay professor of electrical engineering.
“I’m thrilled we’re getting to keep him,” said Computer Science Professor Michael D. Mitzenmacher. “He is going to be a true asset to SEAS in terms of his work, in terms of his personality, and in terms of the energy and excitement he will be bringing to Harvard.”
Mitzenmacher highlighted Wei’s collaborative spirit as one of the ways he would contribute to SEAS in the future.
In particular, he noted that Wei’s extensive research with Computer Science Professor David Brooks had helped to “put Harvard on the map” in the field of hardware and circuit design.
Associate Professor of Computer Science Matt Welsh also said he was excited about Wei’s appointment, in part due to Wei’s ability to draw connections among professors in different subjects.
“He typifies what we like to talk about here in SEAS as the very multidisciplinary type of researcher,” Welsh said. “With the small number of faculty [in the electrical engineering                   department], bridges.”
Welsh said that Wei had been instrumental in planning and securing funding for the “Robobee” project, a research endeavor involving 11 professors from fields as disparate as computer science and organismic and evolutionary biology. The project, which will be supported by a $10 million grant from the National Science Foundation, aims to create a cooperative colony of miniature flying robots that resemble bees.
A number of current and former students also said that they were excited to hear about Wei’s appointment.
Svilen N. Kanev ’12, who has taken two classes with Professor Wei, said he found Wei to be an enthusiastic instructor as well as a helpful mentor.
“He really loves explaining concepts, and obviously does it well,” Kanev said.
Kanev added that Wei has become an unofficial advisor for him. He said that in this capacity, Wei does not cultivate the “classical advisor-advisee relationship,” but rather tends to form closer, friendlier bonds with students.
Benjamin Lee, who received a Ph.D. in computer science from Harvard in 2008, also said that Wei had served as an unofficial advisor for him during his time at Harvard.
He said that Wei had maintained an “open-door policy” with regard to discussing Lee’s research, and he had helped Lee secure a postdoctoral position at Stanford.
“I think he certainly has a vested interesting in seeing his students succeed academically and in their careers,” Lee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Fly Club will likely continue to lease the property at 45 Dunster St. to the Bee Club, bringing an end to nearly a month of uncertainty regarding the future of the building.
The Fly recently sent a letter of intent to the Bee proposing a long-term lease that will last for “more than a couple of decades,” according to John L. Powers ’70, president of the Fly Club’s graduate board.
The two clubs are still negotiating the specifics of the lease, conversations which Powers said may last through the week. But he added that the fundamental aspects of the transaction are “a done deal.”
Over the last month, the Fly entertained offers to sell the space to the Bee, the Chabad House at Harvard, and the Hasty Pudding Club, and hired Boston real estate management firm Colliers Meredith & Grew to help consider the bids. But in the end, the Fly decided to lease the building in order to retain ownership of the property and maintain an amicable relationship with what Powers called their “sister club.”
Despite the significant size of the offers—including a $6 million bid from Chabad—the Fly was hesitant to relinquish its ownership of the property because of the scarcity of Harvard Square real estate and the sense that the real estate market is not at its peak, Powers said.
The Fly Club board was also influenced by the club’s long-standing relationship with the Bee.
“There was also an interest on the part of the Fly of thinking about the larger Harvard community and the stakeholders, and what would be the best in the context of these clubs,” said graduate board member Charles D. Atkinson III ’58.
Powers, who is also a former Crimson sports editor, characterized the lease as one that is mutually beneficial for both clubs.
“We realized we could get what we needed without having to sell, and the Bee could get what it needed with a long-term lease,” he said.
The Fly Club began considering offers to sell the building after the Bee served a notice of termination on their lease to the Fly, effective June 1.
The building at 45 Dunster St.—assessed at $2.7 million by the City of Cambridge—also houses J.Press, the historic upscale men’s clothing boutique.
The Fly took ownership of the building in 1996 after it merged with the now-defunct D.U. Club.
Bee Club President Mariana B. Zobel De Ayala ’11 declined to comment for this article.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s ice skating rink—feverishly hailed as a symbol of former Law School Dean Elena Kagan’s crusade to improving student life—fell victim last year to budget cuts.
Martha L. Minow became dean of the Law School on July 1, 2009, at a time when the institution—rocked by financial uncertainty—was left with an unfinished multi-million dollar construction project at the Northwest Corner and a shaken faculty concerned for the school’s future.
Professors worried that the Law School would be further destabilized by a major transition in the dean’s office.
A year later, faculty and alumni collectively heave a sigh of relief, as the Law School seems to have landed safely on two feet—on better ground, perhaps—with Minow’s steady hand guiding the school forward, even without an ice rink.
“I think it’s been a great year,” Law School professor John C. Coates says. “It’s a tough time for any dean to start given the financial situation.”
Minow’s tenure thus far has been marked by an unusual focus and personal involvement in the academic life of the school, since deans often set aside their own research once they take on administrative responsibilities.
Minow’s ascension represents the installation of a quintessential academic as dean, as reflected in her first year’s priorities: reforming the curriculum, encouraging collaboration between Law School professors and with the University, all while continuing her own teaching and legal research on the side.
Under Minow, offers have been extended to five potential lateral hires, budgets have shrunk only modestly, and the ideological rifts dividing the faculty in past years have not resurfaced.
In filling Kagan’s shoes, Minow has emerged as a well-regarded leader who will build on her predecessor’s reforms while advancing an agenda focused on academic programming and collaboration.
“There was a lot of anxiety about [Kagan’s] departure,” Law School professor John C. P. Goldberg says. “People worried that maybe Dean Kagan was the glue that held the place together.”
NO ROOKIE MISTAKES
Drawing upon her experience as a long-time Law School insider and a member of Kagan’s “kitchen cabinet,” Minow has proven her ability to navigate the egos and politics of the school during what has been a seamless transition, says Law School professor Howell E. Jackson, who served as interim dean.
“She won’t make the rookie mistakes.” Law School professor Robert C. Bordone says.
Before Minow became dean, several faculty members had expressed concerns that she would be too conciliatory, citing her reputation for affability.
But those fears—which her advocates said at the time were unfounded—have not played out, even in the face of difficult choices forced upon her by budget constraints.
Described as “tough-minded,” Minow has proved in the past year—and in her 30 years on the Law School faculty—her willingness her to “fight for things that she thinks are important,” Law School professor John F. Manning ’82 says.
One of only a handful of female professor when she joined the Law School faculty in 1981, Minow has since pushed through various changes—she spearheaded the overhaul of a century-old curriculum at the Law School under Kagan—and established herself as a thoughtful listener as well as an effective doer.
“You don’t come here in the early 80s as a diminutive young woman and succeed the way she succeeded without being pretty tough,” Jackson says. “You can say she’s conciliatory, or you can say she’s from Chicago and she knows how to get things done.”
STAYING IN TOUCH
Minow’s academic bent has been reflected in her vision for the school’s future, as she hopes to shape the curriculum by drawing from multiple disciplines and linking them more closely to the practice of law.
“She is very strongly committed to the idea that the school should be very in touch with the world of practice,” Coates says.
While the Law School has traditionally served as a pipeline for students to prestigious corporate positions, the recent financial crisis resulted in a steep decline in job offers and provided an impetus to rethink the role of the profession.
Echoing a broader trend in the University, Minow’s own resume follows an interdisciplinary approach that is gaining increasing currency in the academic world.
She received a masters degree at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where she continues to lecture, and has taught classes at Harvard College.
As dean, Minow has prioritized the integration of the Law School with other parts of the University by facilitating cross-school teaching and exploring future avenues for collaboration with Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School.
The recent appointment of Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Annette Gordon-Reed to a joint position at the Law School, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is emblematic of Minow’s efforts to build intellectual bridges.
“My sense is that Martha would be really supportive of ways to get faculty here collaborating with other schools,” Bordone says.
MINOW AS SCHOLAR
Despite Minow’s administrative agenda, she has managed to uphold her commitment to teaching and intellectual pursuits.
“It seems one of her goals is to be dean without giving up being an academic,” Manning says. “She thinks of teaching and writing as part of her job.”
Keeping a foot in the classroom allows her to maintain a feel for the school’s pulse.
Though most deans teach occasionally, Minow managed to teach a yearlong course and a class during the winter term—as well as lectured at various universities and completed a book on Brown v. Board of Education to be published this summer—an academic load that Jackson says is unusually heavy.
“It’s a signal to the faculty that that’s what she thinks is important,” Jackson says.
Minow says that the highlight of her week is office hours with her students.
“I love the life I’ve been able to have as a scholar and a teacher here and I want to continue to do that and figuring out how to do that next year is a priority for me,” she says.
