After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today’s pop industry is obsessed with two contrasting storylines—a star’s emergence from obscurity and a celebrity’s sudden crash and fall from fame. Lana Del Rey’s debut album, “Born to Die,” arrives at a time when she is at the crossroad between these narratives. Her instantaneous popularity, which she achieved from viral hits like “Video Games,” has already been compromised by shoddy live performances and critical backlash over her authenticity. The shakiness of her current musical status mirrors the nature of her new album. While early singles released on the web seemed to promise a world of retrograde beauty and femininity, her ensuing album is a hodgepodge of hits and misses. Del Rey might as well have named her album after her own fate, for the LP marks the death of a career born just yesterday.
At times, “Born to Die” acts as a tribute to the sentimentality and glamour of Old Hollywood. Singles such as  “Blue Jeans” and “Video Games” feature Del Rey’s low and silky croon as she references the paradigmatic heartthrob James Dean and remembers, “Singing in the old bars / Swinging with the old stars.” Adopting a vulnerable sound that manifests itself in lingered notes and seductive sighs, Del Rey manages to use otherwise trite lyrics such as “I will love you till the end of time / I would wait a million years” to enhance her nostalgia for classic romance.
Del Rey’s old-fashioned sound continues to be effective in ballads such as “Carmen” and “Born to Die.” In both songs, the singer adheres to the idea that less is more, successfully employing a low vocal range that occasionally melts into a few staccato or falsetto end notes, offering just enough structural variation and melodic surprise to create a memorable impression.
Nevertheless, the laid-back smoothness that Del Rey establishes is punctured by failed attempts at more upbeat, pop-oriented songs. In “National Anthem,” Del Rey’s awkward attempts at cutesy rap ironically realize her lyrics: “He says to ‘be cool,’ but I don’t know how yet.” Furthermore, the artist’s voice falters in “Dark Paradise,” with poor phrasing and nasal upward inflections that betray her lack of vocal experience. The whiny and prepubescent tone that is evident in these tracks overshadows any subtlety in the other tracks on “Born to Die.”
To make things even more perplexing, Del Rey’s success at channeling the bygone era of American culture is ruined by crass tracks whose lyrics flaunt a modern shallowness. On “Diet Mountain Dew” the singer abandons her sultry mood for sped up beats that are paired with Ke$ha-like lyrics about getting “low, down, and dirty.” On “Lolita,” she spells out “D-A-R-K” in the fashion of artists like Fergie and Gwen Stefani, but she also confusingly attempts to allude to literary figures like Vladimir Nabokov’s protagonist and Shakespeare’s Romeo.
“Off to the Races” is the worst of these anachronistic pairings, as its lyrics form a scattered assortment of over-the-top, clichéd lines and tasteless subject matters. The Nabokovian declaration “Light of my life / Fire of my loins” is consequently turned into meaningless buffoonery when followed by such unsavory lyrics as, “Gimme them gold coins / And I’m off to the races / Up Bacardi chases/ Chasing me all over town / Cause he knows I’m wasted.”
With the album’s tracks oscillating between moods and eras, one cannot help but wonder whether Del Rey has a clear sense of her artistic identity. Her haphazard transitions from classic to contemporary, classy to crass, and sensitive to tough show that she lacks the musical maturity necessary for crafting a cohesive album. Furthermore, the back-and-forth swings become repetitive in themselves as the music relies on the same dichotomous ideas while failing to develop more sophisticated narratives or memorable riffs.
Altogether, Del Rey’s vocal misgivings and attempted trashiness destroy her potential to be invigorating to pop music. With no one artistic vision supporting the album, the singer’s voice sounds disconnected from her own music, leaving the listener emotionally detached. For all the hype surrounding Del Rey, it wouldn’t be surprising if she leaves the popular music scene as quickly as she entered it.

Although Ingrid Michaelson’s latest album “Human Again” has many break-up songs, it is not a break-up album. It’s more like a break-down-and-get-back-up album. While Michaelson  skyrocketed to fame riding mostly on whimsical romantic ballads like “The Way I Am”, “You and I,” and “Can’t Help Falling In Love,” “Human Again” introduces Michaelson’s more serious and musically mature side. In fifteen tracks, “Human Again” weaves together a fluid and engaging meditation on lost love, resilience, and inner strength. Michaelson is back, this album says—and she’s tougher than expected.
Through her witty wordplay and catchy melodies, Michaelson carved a place for her work in the already established singer-songwriter folk-pop musical niche alongside artists like Laura Marling, Imogen Heap, and Inara George. After making her debut in 2007 with the album “Girls and Boys,” she gained recognition when several of her songs were featured on popular television shows such as “Grey’s Anatomy” and “One Tree Hill.” “Human Again” is produced by David Kahne, who has formerly worked with artists Regina Spektor and Paul McCartney— artists who, like Michaelson, are known for their distinctive songwriting.
Michaelson’s fifth studio album reflects her growth as a musician but does not stray too far from her musical roots. While “Keep Warm” and “Always You” most closely resemble her famous romantic songs, there’s a newfound sense of gravity in her craft; her voice roams the spectrum from faint and withering to insistent and resonant. Often arranged before a backdrop of soaring strings, Michaelson’s vocal wanderings channel the sound of an older jazz era. There is also more instrumental complexity in this album, especially in the songs “Do It Now,” and “Palm of Your Hand.” Compared to the coffee-shop sensibility of Michaelson’s earlier releases, “Human Again” is a much grander affair.
“Human Again” cycles between two emotional chords. At times, it is upbeat and defiant, with a foot-tapping snappiness produced by the interplay of snare drum, bouncing guitar strumming, and buoyant piano. At other points, Michaelson’s singing takes on a darker, more mournful cast, channeling the raw emotions of heartbreak.  Occasionally the album veers into whispery inertia, but rather than detracting from the whole, such slower tracks like “Always You” function as intimate confessions that leave room for the listener’s thoughts to wander. This is contemplative music, fit for long drives, rainy days, and the small hours of the morning.
That being said, Michaelson has not lost her trademark pep in these records. Though she may reach for more serious notes, she refuses to sound defeated. In “This is War” she insists, “I won’t surrender, I will fight better / You lock me out and knock me down / But I will find my way around.” While Michaelson does make use of cliché, making  references to the rain, the stars, and love that “fills up the room,” she puts her own lyrical spin on these trite images. “We’re all the same under a different name / We’re all blood, we’re all blood, blood brothers,” she proclaims in the track “Blood Brothers,” a hint at the universality of human emotions. The song “Do It Now”—a low-key rallying cry for those who are discouraged and down on their luck—tells listeners, “Don’t waste a minute on the darkness and the pity sitting in your mind.”
“Fire,” one of the high points of the album, is an ideal treadmill track due to its urgent beat and creative use of repetition. In this song, Michaelson shows a high level of control over her vocals, hitting notes all throughout her vocal range as she switches from soft to insistent. “Ghost” is another track destined for the radio; though it does not stray from  the conventions of a modern pop song, it incorporates Michaelson’s unique lyrical flair.
Some may claim that “Human Again” is predictable in its lyrical content and song structure.  While it does not revolutionize the genre, the album plays to Michaelson’s strengths and showcases a sophisticated, richer sound. Although she primarily works with two contrasting moods on this album, she conveys both of them poignantly.

“Racks on racks on racks / Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs,” Jay-Z and Kanye West boast halfway through their elaborate collaborative album, “Watch the Throne.” Although seemingly trivial, these few throwaway syllables capture in a nutshell the opulence of the music of 2011. Whether it was Lady Gaga’s exhaustingly huge, chrome-plated “Born This Way,” or Zola Jesus’s climactic duet that opened up M83’s double album, music in 2011 compared with music in preceding years was bigger, more ambitious, and yes, louder. Albums were generally more sophisticated, better produced, longer, and in the case of Jay-Z’s and West’s, downright expensive-sounding. This maximalist trend produced mixed results: while many of the year’s greatest albums were demanding conceptual works, such as Gang Gang Dance’s “Eye Contact” and Destroyer’s “Kaputt,” other ambitious albums fell under the weight of their own magnitude.
Much of the year’s big sound came not from typically epic legends but from young artists who had been previously known for sparseness. The hipster parvenus of 2009—Girls, Real Estate, Neon Indian, and Washed Out, among others—have shed away the indolence and lo-fidelity gauze of their original chillwave associations, opting for polished and meticulous sophomore LPs. Bon Iver, who charmed blogs and hipster crowds in 2010 with a guitar and a cabin, now makes his rounds on national television with a nine-piece band. The San Francisco-based Girls evolved from its shoddily produced debut to create the operatic “Father, Son, Holy Ghost.” And while the first album of New Jersey-based Real Estate sounded like a compilation of instrumental demos, its 2011 album “Days” was a full fledged compendium of pulsing ’90’s college-radio rock. Altogether, the indie scene transformed from personal projects recorded in garages to full bands playing carefully arranged music.
However, these transformations once again proved that bigger is not always better. While “Father, Son, Holy Ghost” proved to be a step forward for Girls, it was sometimes overwhelmed by bombastic minor-pentatonic guitar solos, Pink Floyd-esque gospel choirs, and organ swells. Despite great advancements in recording quality and musical structure, “Father, Son, Holy Ghost” lacks the spontaneity and scrappiness that made its predecessor so dynamic. Lady Gaga, too, lost some of her singular inventiveness on “Born This Way:” its maxed-out, headache-inducing production surely threatened the sanity of listeners after one too many plays. Interestingly enough, one of the more memorable albums of the year was released by the newcomer Yuck, who stayed away from overproduction in its ferociously romantic debut. We can only hope that Yuck doesn’t follow current musical trends and trade in originality for density in subsequent projects.
Perhaps it is very telling that two of 2011’s standout albums, “Bon Iver,” and “James Blake,” were characterized by restraint. Although these albums were very ambitious, sonically and personally—as “James Blake” saw the transformation of James Blake from a dubstep producer into a dubstep singer-songwriter, if such a thing exists—they rely on tremendous use of negative space. In Blake’s “The Wilhelm Scream,” for example, icy keys and drum hits float through a sonic vacuum.
Blake and Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon are more concerned with wielding evocative sets of textures than creating a multitude of quality songs. “Bon Iver,” for all its orchestral scope, somehow has even fewer identifiable hooks than the artist’s stripped-down debut, and “James Blake” relies heavily on covers. Yet it is these artists’ negotiations between styles that has made their albums so evocative. Both Blake and Vernon employ formidable contrasts: the music is at once restrained and powerfully soulful; the singers overtly masculine while also pensive and poetic.
Bon Iver and James Blake’s albums are tempered rather than overcompensating. They point to a developing indie taste of discernment that is more fascinated by voice and performance rather than songcraft and lyrical content. Although many artists overextended themselves in attempted extravagance, 2011 showed the power of sonic experimentation and extensive studio production. All that’s left is to get on Spotify and spread the word.

Leonard Cohen has spent years patenting his unique sound: raspy, powerful baritone over spare acoustic guitar. However, Cohen’s secret in plain sight is that he’s never actually made a truly minimalist album. From the extensive instrumentation on 1967’s “Songs of Leonard Cohen” to the synthesizers and drum machines on 1988’s “I’m Your Man,” Cohen has made a career out of artfully avoiding his supposed trademark. His newest record, “Old Ideas,” follows this trend. The album, an impressive collection of delicate songs featuring biting, self-deprecating lyrics, is one of his finest releases and a deserving addition to his canon.
There are hints of minimalism here—“Crazy to Love You” really is nothing but Cohen and his acoustic guitar—but much more of the album is characterized by decidedly lush arrangements. These arrangements perfectly frame Cohen’s unabashed pop songs—the closing track, “Different Sides,” is remarkably catchy, and its gentle bounce would be entirely lost had it been arranged more sparsely. Like most of the other songs on the record, it makes fine use of electric piano and female backing vocals. During the chorus, these vocalists even pick up the lead melody. It’s possible that this was done purely out of necessity—Cohen’s vocal range certainly seems to have diminished—but these smooth vocals contrast nicely with his rough-edged voice, giving “Different Sides” a distinctive, almost threatening edge. Likewise, the electric piano makes the song more sprightly and accessible. Other tracks use these tricks even more heavily; on “Come Healing,” the female vocals that nearly upstage Cohen contribute to the song’s unique delectability.
Of course, these seductive pop backgrounds become more than simply pleasurable when they play out against Cohen’s resigned and sometimes bitter lyrics. “Old Ideas,” with its appealing blend of pop and depression, conjures up none other than the famed ’70s group Steely Dan, which played jazzy rock songs that viciously attacked the band’s audience of aging baby boomers and ex-hippies. There are clear differences between this album and the work of Steely Dan—that group rarely turned its anger and cynicism in on itself and incorporated more jazz influences in its work—but the connection between the two is important. Like Steely Dan’s best records, “Old Ideas” thrives on the tension between music and lyrics that don’t quite mesh together. “Going Home,” a compelling deconstruction of Cohen’s status as an artist, gains a certain dramatic power from the way his self-mocking lyrics are backed by the laid-back yet stately arrangement.
Part of the reason this mixture works so well is because Cohen remains a terrific lyricist. “Going Home” is powerful because of how thoroughly it subverts his image not only as a rock icon but also as a poet. When Cohen refers to himself as a “lazy bastard in a suit” and reminds himself that “he doesn’t have a burden,” there’s a sense of self-examination so strong and focused that other introspective rock songs pale in comparison. Incidentally, the lyrics to this track were deemed so uncommonly poignant that they were published as poetry in The New Yorker.
Of course, Cohen’s poems have always become more compelling when he transforms them into intricate songs. His finest tracks, from “So Long, Marianne” to “Hallelujah,” may have fantastic lyrics, but they’re also fully fleshed-out songs and not simply backing tracks for spoken poetry. This pattern holds true for “Going Home,” along with every other track on “Old Ideas.” With its accessible yet powerful sound, the album stands as a fabulous collection of pop songs with more than a hint of darkness.  It is also a potent reminder that Cohen, who has been in the music business for 45 years now, remains one of the few artists who releases works of a high caliber not just consistently, but nearly always.

Sex addict Brandon Sullivan is compelled to fornicate, but he can derive no pleasure or satisfaction from it. This state of suspended animation, where the rest of life is only a lull between orgasms, is the subject of director Steve McQueen’s new film, “Shame,” starring Michael Fassbender as Brandon, a New Yorker unable to control his constant lust for la petite mort. In a typical day, Brandon masturbates first in the shower and then on the toilet at work, has sex with a stranger under a bridge, peruses his copious digital porn collection, watches a girl strip via webcam, drops by a gay bar for a quick blow-job, and finishes by hiring two prostitutes for an impromptu orgy in an anonymous apartment.
The sex in this film is neither titillating nor erotic. McQueen films it all at a dispassionate distance, the camera shots displaying a glacial, almost runic, calm as Brandon transverses the city. Particularly impressive is a single smooth tracking shot of a jogging Fassbender, surrounded by the evidence of teeming population, yet indelibly alone.
Sexual passion is reduced to its most basic physical function—as bodies thrash and seminal fluid flies, intercourse ceases to be enjoyable and becomes an ordeal. When Brandon does try to engineer a relationship that involves emotional intimacy with a co-worker named Marianne (Nicole Behari), he is unable to perform in bed. Sex without feeling is his only release.
The catalyst that might shake Brandon out of this relentless purgatory is the arrival of his sister. Played by Carey Mulligan, Sissy is a frantic, needy wreck who flings herself at the nearest man, who just happens to be Brandon’s odious boss, Dave (James Badge Dale). An involvement beyond the mere familial is hinted at in Brandon and Sissy’s relationship—he walks in on her naked in the shower and she walks in on him masturbating in the bathroom, both without comment, but these encounters never crystallize incestuously. Instead, the latter part of the film veers into mildly disappointing melodrama.
The lack of satisfying denouement exposes the central question hanging over the film—why is Brandon this way? Fassbender gives an absolutely five-star performance, making his recent snub for this film in the Best Actor category by the Academy both cowardly and ludicrous. However, Brandon’s character, which could have been developed by his relationship with Sissy, remains crucially unexplained save her tantalizing suggestion to him, “We’re not bad people; we just come from a bad place.”
What we are left with is a veritable montage of misery, emotionally engaging only insofar as we can believe that Brandon’s constant sexual exploits are actually killing him inside. Fassbender conveys this remarkably well, dutifully pumping away, his face contorted in a rictus grimace of self-loathing and disgust. Beyond this brief moment though, Brandon remains a mystery.
As a portrait of sex addiction, and of a certain kind of modern metrosexual isolation, “Shame” makes a compelling, if grim, viewing experience.  As a portrait of a complete human being however, it leaves much to be desired. McQueen’s detached approach reduces an emotional journey to the simple movement of bodies in space. Perhaps this is the point: only when the sex on screen is stripped of all extraneous baggage can an audience assume a view of it analogous to Brandon’s. However, this Spartan quality ultimately means that the only feeling left when the credits roll isn’t shame at all, but disgust.

For young adults, watching the 1991 version of “Beauty and the Beast” is a highly personal experience, one that alternately elicits nostalgia and increases the anxiety of those who are Disney purists. It is imperative, if only for the sanity of those who grew up glued to the television as Belle tenderly cleaned the Beast’s wound, or as Mrs. Potts nudged Chip into the cupboard, for the movie makers at Walt Disney Pictures to preserve the character and composition of the original  “Beauty and the Beast.” Through stereoscopic imaging, the producers manage to preserve the delightful quality of the original 2D film while also enhancing the viewing experience of the new 3D rendition.
The process of converting 2D to 3D stereoscope is not very simple, as it turns out. The characters in the original version were quite flat, and that was part of their charm. Thus, the process chosen to convert charming 2D images into equally charming 3D images had to be stereoscopy. Stereoscopy is a technique of 3D imaging that combines two layered images to provide a sense of depth for the audience. So, rather than having a 3D experience of objects flying out into the audience so that the movie-goers stretch out arms to catch whatever has been virtually hurled at them, stereoscopic 3D movies have a pop-up book appearance. Instead of leaning back in movie seats to avoid splashes of virtual water or bouncing balls, the audience sits on the edge of their seats, wanting to be drawn into the storybook world.
In the prologue of the movie, when an unknown narrator explains the nature of the spell cast on the Beast’s castle, the camera scans through a series of stained glass window displays. The enhancement here is subtle, but one can see that the black lines that outline each figure are slightly imposed upon the swirling colored glass. This rendering gives the realistic appearance of sun shining through actual windows. Then, as a cast of three dozen 3D townspeople sings Belle along the “provincial” streets, it becomes difficult to follow all of the movement taking place. In a single shot of 10 or so characters, there could be as many as 20 layers, with the bread basket, tips of shoes, and cobbled streets each at a different level of depth. It’s a lot for the human brain to process, and for the first few minutes of the movie the experience is slightly nauseating.
However, as the movie progresses, it is possible to forget how many drawings must have been made, how many combinations of perspective were used, and how long this whole conversion must have taken (five years). Instead, the film exudes sheer enjoyment. The characters are the same, the songs are identical though the sound quality has been enhanced, and Belle still has abnormally large eyes and lips, and thin, flesh-colored fingernails. Perhaps the more maudlin parts of the film are revealed upon second viewing—for instance the number of times Belle is literally or metaphorically locked up by a man, or how often she flops onto beds, floors, shoulders, and snow to sob hysterically, or how many weather conditions “Beauty and the Beast” encompasses. For example, it is easy to notice that it is autumn during the frightening forest journey of Belle’s father, that it snows at the castle, that they dance in the famous waltzing-in-the-gold-ballroom scene to the quiet chirping of spring crickets, and that the final fight scene is fought in a summer thunderstorm. But all these more mature observations might be expected—the original audience of “Beauty and the Beast” is older now, more cynical, and more likely to look critically at Disney.
However, it was a comforting experience to return to a fondly remembered favorite. The 3D imagery was tasteful, and the Beast disappointed no one when he finally transformed into all of his long-haired, hunk-of-a-human glory.

The Marriage of Figaro
February 3-4, 8:30p.m., February 9-11, 8:30 p.m.,
Dunster Dining Hall
Directed by Stewart N. Kramer '12
Music Directed by Matthew A. Aucoin '12
Produced by Ashley N. Kaupert '12, Daniel V. Clark '12, and Civry P. Melvin '14
Questions of sexual fidelity, trust, and desire claim the stage in Mozart’s opera “The Marriage of Figaro.” Written in 1786, this groundbreaking opera combines a revolutionary satire of government and aristocracy with some of classical opera’s most romantic musical moments. “Mozart chose to focus on the romantic dynamics of the piece itself,” says Stewart N. Kramer ’12, director of Dunster House Opera’s upcoming production. Mozart’s collaboration with Lorenzo Da Ponte, who wrote the Italian libretto, “is about men and women; it’s about relationships rather than about politics,” Kramer said.
In the opera, the imminent marriage of a butler, Figaro, and a maid, Susanna, in the home of their master, a count with a penchant for lusting after women who are not the countess, spurs an onslaught of misinterpretations, schemes, and designs for revenge. Kramer and music director Matthew A. Aucoin ‘12 deal with this tangle of relationships in much the same way that most directors have since 1786, but with one outstanding exception: they translated the opera themselves.
Many translations of “The Marriage of Figaro” are so obtuse that “it stops you from enjoying the comedy and it stops you from taking the serious moments seriously,” says Kramer. For this reason, he and Aucoin decided to translate on their own. According to the Dunster House Opera Society, they are the first students at Harvard to stage an opera featuring their own translation of the libretto. Their aim is to make this piece as straightforward as possible for modern listeners while staying faithful to the original text. In other words, this translation follows the rhythm and rhyme scheme of the original Italian. This accuracy is not just an aesthetic choice, but it is also important for musical reasons as well. “Mozart had a lot of fun placing certain emphases on moments where the text rhymes, so I figured, even if it drives me crazy, I want to preserve every single rhyme in this piece,” Aucoin, who is fluent in Italian, says.
This fidelity to the text means that the production preserves aspects of the opera that most directors usually cut out, such as characters’ asides to the audience. “A lot of English translators seem to think, “We’re not going to get it exact, so we might as well do whatever the hell we want,” said Aucoin. “I think that’s B.S.. I think you can come pretty close.”

The old-school adventure of Tintin evokes the kind of nostalgia one has for “The Hardy Boys” series. Sure, both are both cheesy and offer predictable endings, but an innocent sense of adventure keeps both series alive.
With one look at the list of well-known directors, producers, and writers on board with “The Adventures of Tintin”—including Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright—the last thing someone would expect to come from this collaboration would be the slightly disappointing “Tintin.” Admittedly, if any group of filmmakers could successfully adapt a dated cartoon about a teenage sleuth and his dog into a relevant and engaging film, it would most certainly have been this one. While “Tintin” did not disappoint as an approachable family film, this team of talent could have explored more exciting avenues than just remaking a classic comic.
The eponymous comic on which “Tintin” is based tells the story of young Belgian reporter Tintin, who battles with caricature portrayals of evil such as an artifact-smuggling ring in the Amazon and a revenge-seeking descendent of a slain pirate. The series—written by Georges Remi in the 1940s and 50s—portrays Tintin as a sort of superhero journalist who always prevails in the face of villainy.
The comic “Tintin” is clearly a product of the Cold War era. It is good guys versus bad guys, with a new mystery around every corner. It’s high adventure, and even higher stakes; it’s the same old story we’ve heard again and again in literature and film.
Similar stories such as “Nancy Drew” and “The Boxcar Children” have constructed a genre of stories centered around young teen sleuths. However, there is probably a good reason these franchises have not produced well-made film adaptations: they are dated beyond belief. When Tintin yells, “Great snakes!” at the discovery of a clue or when he escapes from the “Sultan’s palace,” the material shows its age as a relic of the ’40s and ’50s.  When compared to the modernity of the film’s photorealistic animation values in such illustrations as hair and skin textures to the vivid rendering of the ocean, there is a disconnect that undermines the naïve, simple honesty of the original series.  Thus, it is hard to experience the earnest, cartoon quality of the original comics when the directors are determined to make “Tintin” as visually realistic as possible.
“Tintin” could have evolved from merely an expensive kids’ film into a dynamic adventure movie in the style of “Indiana Jones” if the directors and writers had committed to developing the characters’ personalities. Instead, they spend time on characters that are two-dimensional despite their 3D rendering. Two prime examples are Thomson and Thompson, two bumbling detectives whose purpose is only to provide the film with questionably necessary slapstick comedy.
Ultimately, “Tintin” remains faithful to the comics in message, and that devotion is what can sell the movie to its nostalgic fans. It retains a comforting, innocent sense of adventure that is hard to find in a year of movies with convoluted motives and gritty realism. This naïveté is one of the movie’s strongest points, but also one of its faults. It does not stray far from the old story structure viewers have seen again and again, and the movie predictably telegraphs the ending almost from the second or third scene. However, enjoying the comic “Tintin” is an exercise in suspension of disbelief, and that is much harder when one is presented with such an uncannily life-like rendering of the essentially cartoonish quality of its characters.

“What differentiates you from the other choreographers?”
“I’m better.”
The crowd erupts with laughter as Jorma Elo, resident choreographer of the Boston Ballet, smiles during a preview and disscussion at the Harvard Dance Center. Much like its choreographer’s personality, “Sharp Side of the Dark,” a piece within “Play With Fire”, retains an innocent quality and humor in its dance movements and nuances. The ballet was the beginning of three excerpts that were highlighted Friday night as a preview for “Play With Fire”, the Boston Ballet’s newest program, at the Harvard Dance Center. The three-piece set served as a testament to the progression of modern dance and the Boston Ballet’s commitment to expanding its horizons. It was followed by a panel discussion featuring Elo as well as company dancers Rachel Cossar and Sabi Varga and artistic director Mikko Nissinen, who served as the moderator for the night.
Last Friday, Elo taught a public ballet master class at Harvard that coincided with Boston Ballet’s long-standing idea of spreading the love of dance and the growth of ballet. After starting with warm-ups, the dancers proceeded with phrases of choreography that lasted for about thirty seconds and were repeated after corrections from Elo. Whitney R. S. Fitts ’12, who took the class, says Elo’s “really strong attention to detail changed the quality of dancing.”
This attention to minutiae was made apparent in “Sharp Side of the Dark,” originally performed in 2002, through the isolation of movement and unusual placements of the hands. “[The hand movements] come naturally to me,” says Elo during the discussion. “That’s the way I react to music.” Starting with silence, the ballet progresses to the soft singing of the dancers and finally continues to the sudden introduction of an orchestral movement by Bach. This transition and unique usage of silence and music underlines the dancers’ purposeful actions and the night’s emphasis on modern movement.
Following Elo’s work was an excerpt from “Rooster”, which was set to music by the Rolling Stones and choreographed by Christopher Bruce. The piece provided an insight into the tenuous relationship between using popular music and artistic integrity by featuring music from a band that wanted to remain original in the face of commerical interests. The program ended with “Bella Figura” by Jiri Kylian, who Nissinen called  “possibly the foremost contemporary choreographer.”
A bold and forward-thinking style of dance defines Boston Ballet’s mantra. Never performed in the United States until now, “Bella Figura” wasn’t the first Kylian work performed by the company. “Black and White,” a five-work set only otherwise presented at the Nederlands Dans Theater preceeded “Bella Figura” as the first to be performed stateside. According to Nissinen,  “Black and White” opened to great successes, leading the way for “Bella Figura”.
Without the aid of rehearsal clothes  and the glare of lights and stage equipment, the performance had a pesonal feeling. Speaking to the emotional impact of the dances, Hazel A. Lever ’13, former director and current producer of the Harvard Ballet Company, says “It was interesting to see how touching the dance was without the costumes and the elaborate effects that they have in the theater.”
The discussion was unstructured, allowing insight into the speakers’ artistic views and personalities. Ranging from ballet in communist Hungary to Elo’s preparation for choreographing the dancers, the discussion subjects were varied and telling to the depth behind ballet.
“I… want the company to reflect the makeup of the people in Boston” says Nissinen. “I’m not looking for cookie-cutter [dancers].” As evidenced by the dancers, who were of 10 different nationalities, and the choice of music and repertoire, Boston Ballet’s development of an artistically progressive identity is apparent. With a glimmer of pride, Nissinen firmly asserts that the Boston Ballet is definitely a “ballet company of the future.”

John B. Austin ’56, creator of the church opera “Heloise and Abelard,” was an English concentrator and resident of Eliot House during his time at Harvard. Though he did not study in the Harvard Department of Music, he composed for performances in Paine Hall and sang for the Chorus Pro Musica in Boston under the tutelage of his mentor and fellow composer, Roy Harris. Opera News, a publication of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, deemed his one-act opera “Orpheus” (1966) the first rock-and-roll opera ever. His music has been performed widely in Chicago and elsewhere, including the Tanglewood, Aspen, and Door County festivals.
The Harvard Crimson: How difficult is it to transpose a story into a musical score?John B. Austin: To answer your question, having a good libretto—like having any good text—is essential because [my wife Christine Froula’s] libretto just shaped every scene into almost a musical form; it was wonderful to work with. I changed a few things, but not all that much. The other thing about writing an opera, from my point of view, is you just keep putting one foot forward—it’s a lot of music and you just have to persevere and keep “office hours,” as Stravinsky said.
THC: How do you begin the process? What’s the first step you take in composing?JBA: I’ve told people sometimes three notes—the way three notes come together—can get me started. There is a certain mystery to it, but once you start, that’s when you keep office hours. You get up every day and you struggle with it. As it progresses, of course, things begin to talk back to you. I mean there are lots of things that went on in later scenes that sort of resonate in other music and—a novelist would tell you the same thing—it begins to develop itself in a way.
THC: So was music always a passion?JBA: Yes. When I was nine…I had alternate daydreams. In one of them I was a fighter pilot. I had no concept of what that meant, but I knew what the airplanes looked like, and I had models, so I would be the hero of the skies. [In] the other one, I was a concert pianist and in my daydreams—I can remember vividly the picture aspect of it—I would walk onstage and I would play a recital. The only thing is, I didn’t know any music, and so the music I obviously generated [by myself]—and I was hooked from then on. I’ve done a lot of different things in my life, but music [has] always been central.
THC: Once you saw this image of yourself as a concert pianist, did you pick up the piano?JBA: Yeah, I started late because [World War II] intervened and we left our hometown and my father was in the army. I started piano lessons really late, unfortunately, because I think I would have played better if I had started earlier. But I’ve done a lot of singing in different choruses.
THC: Who were your mentors?JBA: I started [with opera] when I got out of school [and] had an introduction to Roy Harris. He was almost an exact contemporary of [composer]Aaron Copland’s and at a time was equally famous. And he came to my hometown, Pittsburgh, to teach at what was then the Pittsburgh College for Women and I was at boarding school. So I went to audition with Roy and he gave me some sort of sound test—saw whether I had a musical ear or not—and took me on. So I studied with him on vacations and every other summer during my college years—the intervening summers I had to work. But one of the things he insisted on was that I not study at the Harvard music department because he was very anti-academic in some ways. I think it was probably a big mistake, and in other ways it’s like anything else where you get to a certain point…you’re made up of all [these] collections of bits and pieces of things. His way of teaching was very disciplined in its way; it just wasn’t the same way as, you know, academia. I should have studied with Walter Piston here. [He] and Harris knew each other, they were the same generation…but, in any case, I didn’t avail myself of that opportunity.
THC: Tell me about your time at Harvard.JBA: Here [at Harvard], I was very active. I had my first orchestra piece played here with the Bach Society Orchestra. [The director] asked me one day if I wanted to write a piece for them. It was my first commission. It had no money, but it was definitely a commission to write for the Bach Society Orchestra and it was great!

On the one-year anniversary of the Tahrir Square protests, where Egyptain citizens successfully overturned the militant political reigme in power, Boston’s School of the Museum of Fine Arts has put on “Histories of Now,” a fascinating exhibit about Egypt’s social and political past, present, and future. The show features seven works by Mohamed Abla, Hala Elkoussy, Shady El Noshokaty, Sabah Naim, Motaz Nasr, and Ahmed Basiony, six contemporary Egyptian artists who present their unique visions through a series of video installations. Though the videos cover a wide range of materials, each touches on the importance of preserving the past during a rapidly evolving present.
The installations are organized in two large rooms, and each room highlights distinct aspects of Egypt’s cultural landscape. They also jointly provide a candid portrayal of the everyday lives, concerns, and dreams of the artists and their subjects. The visual recordings are projected onto walls or played on television screens, creating a captivating spatial dynamic that reflects the diversity of the subject matter associated with each video. The audio attached to some of the recordings also creates an ethereal atmosphere, which, paired with the dark walls, easily draws the viewer into the glow of the each video.
For example, Noshokaty’s “Stammer—A Lecture in Theory” is a two-part installation that features elements from a classroom. It features a video of a man drawing furiously projected onto a blackboard and a video of a classroom full of chanting Egyptian students projected onto the wall behind it. The juxtaposition of these images represents the conflict between memorization and free thought in Egyptian society. The loud chanting resounds throughout the space, and the repetition of the phrase is strangely haunting.
The mesmerizing vibe of Noshokaty’s video is complimented by one of Nasr’s works in the adjacent room. The video, entitled “Merge and Emerge,” is a three-screen installation that takes up an entire wall of the room. In the video, three Sufis wearing bright, monochromatic robes practice whirling—the traditional meditative dance associated with Sufi Islam. As the dancers “merge and emerge” between the screens, the bird’s-eye view of the camera creates hypnotic shapes and shadows. The soothing and somewhat mysterious mood of Noshokaty’s video stands in stark contrast to the tones of some of the other videos.
The often abrupt change in tone between the seven videos is a thoughtful reminder of the scope of cultural assets and issues that Egypt holds. Works like Elkoussy’s “First Story—Mount of Forgetfulness” pairs religious and historical mythology with snapshots of modern Egyptians, while Abla’s “Out of the Water” presents the past through the lens of a documentary film about the physical preservation of Qorsaya Island.
Naim’s “People of the City” presents a story of life in contemporary Egypt through the fleeting impressions of people on the subways and streets of Cairo. “People of the City” faces Nasr’s video of the whirling Sufis, emphasizing Egypt’s historical and cultural richness as well as the major differences between this artist’s two works. One video features an intriacte tribal dance juxaposed with a deptiction of urban Egyptian citizens travelling on a subway. The deliberate disharmony in the overall design of the exhibition reflects the cultural energy that is present in a city as large as Cairo.
The mix of subjects, themes, and presentations also works to create a powerful effect, especially in light of the recent political upheaval in Egypt. Basiony’s “30 Days of Running in the Place” and Nasr’s “The Echo” both deal with civil revolution, and while watching the videos it is possible to place them in context of the country’s recent cultural shift, though the revolution is not explicitly the focus of either video. The former pieces together footage from the Tahrir Square protests with shots of the artist running in place, while the latter takes a video of revolution speech from a film from the 1960s and places it next to a video of a woman in the modern day performing the same speech. These artistic commentaries on historical conflict work with the rest of the exhibition to highlight the current cultural climate of Cairo and Egypt as viewed by their citizens.
The exhibition is altogether powerful in its subtlety. The variety of questions and topics that the pieces of art portray are made even more dramatic due to the use of the video and sound mediums. With “Histories of Now: Six Artists from Cairo”, the curators have succeeded in providing the audience with a glimpse of Cairo and Egypt through the eyes of its own people, creating a truthful and compelling exhibition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Rwanda, 1994, and Jean Patrick—a scientist and Olympic track hopeful—finds himself torn between abandoning his Tutsi identity and risking violence or even death.
In “Running the Rift,” author Naomi Benaron chronicles Jean Patrick’s upbringing and path to college, and through his voice,  narrates a personal tale of the atrocities committed in the Rwandan genocide by both sides of the Hutu-Tutsi ethnic rift. Benaron expertly entwines the physical pain of running, the emotional pain of loss, and the somber ache of recovery, in an admirable first novel exploring the travails and resilience of refugees worldwide.
Jean Patrick is Tutsi, an ethnicity Belgian imperialists treated preferentially on account of their supposed higher foreheads, taller statures, and greater wealth. Along with the rest of the country, Jean Patrick has witnessed years of ethnic conflict following the Belgians’ departure. Even personal relationships are not safe from the tensions; Jean Patrick’s brother joins a coalition of Tutsi rebels, while Jean Patrick falls in love with a Hutu girl, thereby endangering both of their lives as well as her family.  He must obtain a fake Hutu identification card in order to travel safely and leave school grounds to run, leading him to question the morality of abandoning his family’s ethnic heritage.
Themes of identity, anger, and forgiveness coalesce seamlessly in Benaron’s novel. Her background as an author of short fiction is apparent in the structure of “Running the Rift,” as the novel is composed of many short scenes, each rich with imagery, that help to connect the numerous themes. Some scenes are two lines, while others last a chapter; this literary convention allows Benaron to play with time, stretching the painful moments longer or abbreviating scenes that Jean Patrick would have wanted to block out of his memory—like when Hutu fighters drag a family of Tutsi from hiding and beat them to death while Jean Patrick hides “close enough to reach out and touch them.” Truncated in both length and description, Jean Patrick’s experience stands out as much for its violence as for his desire to forget these horrors. Benaron also lengthens time when Jean Patrick remembers certain haunting events, dwelling on particularly painful moments such as his return to his childhood home, where he unearths human bones from destroyed huts.
Jean Patrick’s track races, an integral element in the narrative, exhibit convincing dramatic depth, in part because of Benaron’s personal experience as an Ironman triathlete. She describes the peculiar feeling of pushing oneself to the fullest and also realizing the physical limitations of the human body, “as if there were two of him, the runner of his spirit, who could fly, and the runner of his body, who teetered on the edge of surrender.” This contrast—of almost escaping and of knowing the fragility of a human life—is a theme that recurs throughout the novel. Just when Jean Patrick seems on the brink of happiness or of outrunning his competitors, the civil war returns and ethnic conflict brings violence to his friends and family, irrevocably changing the world around him.
Nearly two decades have passed since the Rwandan genocide, and countless books, both fiction and nonfiction, have been written about the conflict, allowing the world time to reflect on actions taken by both factions. Benaron tries to bring closure to her characters, yet coming to terms with the murder of his countrymen will clearly haunt Jean Patrick for the rest of his life, as it likely haunts many of those who have survived the genocide.
Benaron visited Rwanda for the first time in 2002. There, she met Mathilde Mukantabana and Alexandre Kimenyi, two Rwandans who shared their stories and helped to shape many of Jean Patrick’s struggles. Despite Benaron’s limited exposure to Rwanda during the time of the genocide, Jean Patrick’s story contains a great deal of truth alongside invention: many of his experiences are drawn from Benaron’s talks with Rwandan refugees. Benaron dedicated her novel to her two vital contacts and “all the survivors...who lent me their voices.” The sheer number of voices in “Running the Rift” lends substance and authenticity to this powerful novel, artfully encompassing conflict, danger, and identity.

Often the most relatable characters are also the most ordinary ones, and as such we can all relate to Wanda Mae Pretty. Her seemingly banal exterior belies an inner imaginitive life, in which the real and the unreal coexist, and her struggle with these opposites drives the plot of David Valdes Greenwood’s new play, “Wandaleria,” directed by Brett Marks and showing at the Boston Playwrights’ Theatre from Jan. 26 to Feb. 11. Although “Wandaleria” isn’t quite as novel as one might hope, this is overcome by fantastic performances by the cast.
One of the overarching tropes of “Wandaleria” is the monotony of suburbia and its residents. The three central characters represent a suburban family: Wanda (Kate deLima) is overwhelmingly ordinary—she is a middle-aged, overweight, and lazy woman—but to us, she is a reflection of ourselves. As her character develops, it becomes clear that her idiosyncratic habits and fears are typical of people everywhere. Within the first few scenes of the play, we see that many of Wanda’s characteristics—her obsession with dreams, her inability to act on them, her distaste for her true self—are more universal than suburban.
Wanda’s roommate Betsy (Shelley Brown) serves as a mother figure to both Wanda and Wanda’s niece Ivy (Caitlyn Conley).
When Rocky (Peter Brown), an inmate who is Wanda’s longtime pen pal, shows up on their doorstep one snowy night, Betsy is livid with anger, and this disagreement serves as the primary conflict of the play.
Ivy also plays her role as a surrogate sister to Wanda in this makeshift family—she remains supportive of Wanda even though the two couldn’t be any more different.
All three members of the fictitious family are fundamentally dissatisfied with life, but for their own reasons: Betsy silently copes with a loss of a loved one, Wanda’s fantasies become an almost agoraphobic tendency that she uses to escape from realities of everyday life that she is unable to face, and Ivy struggles with a premature marriage and repressed memories. All three women ultimately want excitement from life but are trapped in a small, unnamed town, in which even the road they live on has a generically bland name: Hazelnut Street. At one rousing point in the play, the three characters reveal their innermost secrets to the audience simultaneously and make a collective commentary on suburbia, culminating in Ivy’s distressed question, “How do you know when your life is enough?” followed by a bitterly expectant silence.
Although trite, the play’s theme of suburban dissatisfaction is brought to life by both the actors and the writing. One of the most unusual aspects of the performance is the interaction between reality—what is really happening—and fantasy—what is occurring in Wanda’s imagination. Because these scenes are all acted out on the same set, the play requires immediate clarity of the distinction between these scenes as well as a sense of continuity among them. On the small but cozy set at Boston Playwrights’ Theatre, the cast effectively handles this balance, allowing the message and themes of the play to come clearly to the audience. A particularly telling example of such an exchange occurs when Wanda shows Ivy the blouse she has bought; at first, Ivy’s reaction is overwhelmingly positive, but then the lighting changes and the characters resume their original positions as we realize that the previous exchange had been a figment of Wanda’s hopeful imagination.
The performance is impressive in that the fantasies are portrayed in the same scene as the realities. By doing this, Marks creates a juxtaposition between the two scenarios that is both effective and immediate. Several times throughout the work, Wanda’s world freezes as the audience focuses on Rocky. This element of “Wandaleria” could easily have made the play hard to follow, but the transitions between scenes are quick and fluid, and the sound and lighting is well thought out and coordinated with the action on stage; clearly, no detail was overlooked in the staging of this performance.
Certainly, the theme of mundane suburbia and the resulting dissatisfaction with life is not a new one, and admittedly, the constant emphasis on the drudgery of suburban life at times makes seeing “Wandaleria” feel like listening to an Arcade Fire album, but the play redeems itself by bringing innovative playwriting and effective acting to its audience. Although the show is flawed, you will surely be charmed by the lovable characters that bring “Wandaleria” to life.

“So you don’t know what it’s like to lose your faith,” the protagonist of “American Dervish” begins to his girlfriend, narrating the story of his childhood transformation. “It’s freeing. So freeing. It’s the most freeing thing that’s ever happened to me.” In “American Dervish,” Ayad Akhtar’s capable, imaginative prose brings to life the story of Hayat Shah, a young Pakistani-American boy growing up in the suburbs of Milwaukee. His spiritual crisis forms the crux of this coming-of-age tale.
Raised in a troubled home by a militantly atheist father and a quietly spiritual mother, Hayat’s upbringing is largely devoid of religion until Mina, his mother’s best friend, moves in with the family. With her young son in tow, she arrives in America hoping to escape an abusive relationship. Her beauty and piety captivate Hayat from the moment he sees her, and under her tutelage, Hayat explores Islam for the first time in his life. With the emotional health of his family continually on the brink of disaster, however, Hayat descends further into an extreme, all-consuming passion to memorize and take to heart every teaching of the Quran. Consumed with jealously for Mina’s new boyfriend, distraught over his father’s growing alcoholism, and unable to deal with his mother’s fragile emotions, Hayat obsessively pours himself into his studies with a fervor that quickly takes over his life.
Writing from the point of view of a child is always difficult, and portraying the story of one progressively more infused with religious zeal is undoubtedly challenging. Akhtar’s attention to the smallest details in Hayat’s world grounds the story in realism, even as the characters grow increasingly fanatical and broken. His descriptions of near-divine moments, like dreaming about Muhammad, fill the pages of “American Dervish” with spiritual experiences rarely seen in modern fiction. “Even my bones seemed to be breathing,” Hayat recalls about the day he discovered his faith. “My body felt whole, one, unified, filled with air, expanding with light.”
While these intensely provocative and realistic descriptions enliven the book beyond a typical story of adolescent angst, Akhtar’s characters lack the same depth. No one in Hayat’s life seems to grow or change—not his angry father, his shrewish and passive mother, not self-destructive Mina. And while Hayat’s struggle with his own faith is well chronicled, his actual emotions—typically the more believable aspect of an 11-year-old’s maturation—often remain veiled behind an increasingly all-consuming religious mindset. This may have been an authorial decision made in order to highlight how deeply entrenched Hayat’s new moralistic views are, yet with other similarly underdeveloped characters, it becomes a weakness in Akhtar’s writing.
Where the novel fails with character development, however, it triumphs in religious exploration. Though at first glance Hayat’s fanaticism and exposure to Islamic fundamentalism reads as a one-sided condemnation of extremist Muslim faith, Akhtar artfully and intelligently juxtaposes other radical views with Hayat’s experience. Through this multi-dimensional picture, he explores the devastating consequences of holding any one tenet too dear. Hayat’s scientist father, for example, is as ardently atheist as his son is religious. Raised in an abusive household, Hayat’s father has eschewed religion to the point of openly mocking all believers and, eventually, he forbids his son from studying the Quran. Though the novel includes several disturbing anti-Semitic interactions, Akhtar also writes an equally frightening scene where Hayat’s father rips his son’s Quran to shreds and burns it in their backyard. “He growled as he tossed the cover down and set about ripping the pages free,” Hayat remembers. “He had a wild look in his eye as he stepped madly on the pieces of our holy book.” Hayat’s father, Akhtar shows, is just as violently and unhealthily entrenched in his views as those he decries.
Ultimately, the novel’s triumph comes not from its oft-overblown plot, but from its deep attention to, and preoccupation with, the power of religion. Originally taking up the study of the Quran to better understand the world around him, Hayat’s eventual quest to save both his soul and those of his parents is deeply and disturbingly portrayed. “Life was like watching a show you loved. You didn’t want it to end. But it would end, sooner or later; that’s just the way it was,” Hayat muses. “The sooner you started getting yourself ready for what was coming after, the better.” This definitive take on mortality and the afterlife—especially coming from the mind of such a young narrator—is disquieting and often overwhelming. As the novel opens with an adult Hayat preparing to explain the loss of his faith, the entire story seems a prelude to the final point revealing how someone who believed so intensely in his religion could so wholly abandon it.  It is this question that drives forward the meandering action of “American Dervish,” and what emerges is an honest, heartrending piece of literature.

When stereotyping the French novel, one conjures up images of darkly lit Parisian cafés and picturesque cul-de-sacs, charging chevaliers of old epics and anguished lovers à la Flaubert. This is not so for Frédéric Mars. “I switch genres,” says the French author, who dabbles in thrillers, romantic comedies, and even fantasy. “I have to renew myself and my writing.” With this commitment to the protean in mind, he has an embarked on his newest endeavor: a suspenseful novel, evocative of Dennis Lehane’s “Shutter Island,” that splits its time between Harvard, downtown Boston, and Devens, a medical prison an hour west of Boston. In order to gain a better understanding of the upcoming book’s setting, Mars visited Harvard and met with The Crimson as part of a two-way interview, revealing important aspects of his work and learning about Harvard life in the process.
Mars has been writing for more than half his life: he worked as a journalist for 11 years before switching, 10 years ago, to popular fiction. Although Mars says much of contemporary French literature is focused on attaining literary awards like the prestigious Prix Goncourt, Mars claims that in the past 10 to 15 years “popular genres of literature or ‘polars’ in French [have become] more respected by the critics.” He has published more than 40 works, including six novels. These range from “Le Sang du Christ” (“The Blood of Christ”), a tale of intrigue set in the Jerusalem of Jesus of Nazareth, to “L’amour Est une Femme” (“Love Is a Woman”), an amnesiac love story. Mars’ most recent novel, “Nonstop,” takes on a global terrorist threat that emerges in the wake of September 11’s eleventh anniversary. “Nonstop” was released in November, but Mars is back at work on a new novel.
For his next project, Mars chose Harvard as “the center of [his] literary universe.” His novel follows an undergraduate as he becomes embroiled in a series of murders that take place on Harvard’s campus and in the Greater Boston area. Mars’ protagonist is a bit of a loner—he is of lesser means than his classmates and has lost both his parents—but he soon sees his name in lights, or rather printed on the front of a new bestseller. This may sound too good to be true, and it is, for the book in the story is no mere novel but a handbook for serial killers. When a number of murders are carried out according to the handbook’s specifications, the young protagonist is naturally seen as a primary suspect.
It might be hard to imagine a series of murders happening in vibrant Harvard Square or the heavily patrolled Yard, but luckily for Mars’ plot—if not for his fictional victims—he has tied up that loose end with a geographical adjustment. The protagonist of the new novel resides in the Quad, a place where Mars suggests “it is easier to see bad things happening.” It becomes even more true when you consider that, despite its nearly 1,000 residents, these three Houses possess the eerie quietness of an abandoned city. In addition to the Quad’s almost haunting aura, Mars had socioeconomic motives at heart for, at least in his perception, “the Quad is set apart from the more aristocratic Yard and River Houses; it is the suburbs of Harvard. My character is also an outcast.” Though residents may disagree with this characterization, the Quad’s location does lend itself well to the premise of Mars’ novel.
Because Mars believes that it is important to fill your writing with “details you grab from your everyday life,” it was imperative for him to see Harvard, especially his character’s home. After all, experiencing the locales in his novels firsthand has suited him well while in the midst of writing previous novels; he spent time in New York for “Nonstop” and Jerusalem for “Le Sang du Christ.”  As we walked around the Quad, Mars took note not only of large-scale details like architecture, but also of seemingly inconsequential ones like the lettering above a doorway or the size of a Cabot common room. “You discover little things that are useful from photos,” says Mars, dutifully using a camera to record whatever struck his eye. Indeed, it’s the small details that make a novel, however outlandish its plot, most convincing.
When asked what audience he was trying to reach with his account of murder and intrigue at Harvard, Mars succinctly replied, “The first reader you want to reach and move is yourself.” Write a book that you yourself would want to read, he explained. Don’t try to appease the critics or reach the top of the best-seller list. “It is more important for a writer to feel strongly about his subject, so that he wakes up everyday wanting to create something astounding,” says Mars. Thesis writers, take note.

Some people say that musical talent is a God-given gift. But it’s more likely that gypsy violinist Roby Lakatos  sold his soul to the devil.
Great musicians, by the sheer force of their talent, have the opportunity to break out of the niche imposed on them by the music industry and wow audiences that fail to notice their less extraordinary peers. Whereas most artists can only reach the small group of fans interested in their particular sub-genre, a virtuoso can grab listeners of all types with a single note from his or her violin.
Lakatos, a world-renowned violinist sometimes called “The Devil’s Fiddler,”  brought his ensemble to Sanders Theatre  on Friday night as part of the Celebrity Series of Boston. The six men in the group played a medley of songs, all of which had a distinct folk-music flair. The works performed ranged from tango to jazz, and the group played two pieces that were arranged by Lakatos himself.
Lakatos’ ensemble combined grace and rhythmic style that was energized and fast-paced but did not spin out of control. The interplay between the performers created some beautifully complex harmonies, especially between the violins—played by László Bóni and Lakatos—and a traditional eastern European hammer dulcimer called the cimbalom played by Jenö István Lisztes. The entire group worked together to support the leading instrument, usually Lakatos and his violin. They often performed with a gleeful energy that highlighted the dynamism of the music they were playing. Though Lakatos’ bow began to fray as he played, he kept up his feverish pace and simply pulled off the broken strands of horse hair when he wasn’t playing.
Lakatos was the central figure of the show, and Lisztes led the ensemble in a few arrangements, amony them “Le Vol du Bourdon,” or “The Flight of the Bumblebee,” a piece notorious for the technical skill required to play it. He tackled the song with the poise and grace of a true master, sometimes moving so fast that the small hammers he used to sound the strings of his instrument blurred.
Even given the talent of his ensemble, Lakatos’ violin stole the show. He was perfectly in sync with his backing musicians and would adapt his style to every subtle change in tempo or feel. Sometimes his playing was forceful and strong, at other times it was more focused and nuanced. There were moments when Lakatos’ playing would fade into the harmonies of the ensemble entirely, creating one unified but complex sonic texture.
The pace and tempo were never static for too long, and the ensemble managed to balance both improvisation and classical structure. Lakatos exuded control over his music but never gave up the agility of his violin.
The whole group created a flow of tension and energy that would alternate between melodramatic and gleeful. When the tempo would dip, the violins would take control, guiding the music and lending a melancholy air to the song. Then the pace would quicken and the performers noticably become more intense. The music would change as they moved together to tackle the new tempo set by their leader. Lakatos paced and dipped across the stage, stomping to emphasize the beat and urging the audience to clap when the energy was high.
While at times Lakatos would overshadow the rest of his colleagues, the ensemble’s consistently exellent playing was impressive in its own right. Every player had energy and emotion and gave the show a playful dynamic between classical form and folk creativity that is rarely seen on stage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week before filmmaker Thorsten Trimpop traveled to Japan to shoot a documentary on last year’s earthquake, he was giving careful consideration to footage Oliver Luo ’13 had shot of his feet as he walked from the quad to the Carpenter Center. Luo’s 18-minute journey passed over a variety of different terrains. “To have this quality of different grounds you’re walking on, to go from this brick ground to something else...it’s really interesting,” Trimpop said of the video.
Trimpop’s film course was one of the six different January Arts Intensives offered at Harvard’s Arts @ 29 Garden center during Wintersession. Luo, like other students in the intensive, had shot his footage on a cell phone rather than with a traditional camera. “The basic idea was to use something we always have in our pockets, but now we are using it to make art. That’s a goal,” Trimpop said.
Like the five other intensives, which covered theater, performance art, music, creative writing, and online media, Trimpop’s film intensive focused on a central theme chosen for this year’s programs—the way digital media have affected artistic expression.
“We heard that there was a sort of interest in a way to learn a little bit more about the way technology is affecting the arts and changing the way we make art,” said Bess Paupeck, the program manager for Arts @ 29 Garden. “We’re trying to answer that call with this group of intensives that touch on the way technology is coming into play in a variety of settings within the arts.” In these intensives, students’ work suggested that the digital age’s most significant impact on the arts was allowing the creator to access and manipulate a wide range of source material.
This was clearest during the final presentations on Jan. 20, when students from the six different intensives displayed their work. “We are all speaking the language of remix,” instructor Sarah E. Hankins said during these presentations. “Remix” was an appropriate description for an event that included theater students writing monologues inspired by characters in YouTube videos, beginning DJs mashing up everything from dubstep to Swahili pop music, and participants in the performance art intensive staging works based on poetry.
Hankins is no stranger to mixing herself—she meshes roles as a Harvard graduate student in ethnomusicology, a professional club DJ known as DJ Super Squirrel, and instructor for the music intensive, which taught students the fundamentals of DJ mixing. Like the other fields covered by the intensives, DJ mixing has been thoroughly affected by the digital age. Though Hankins did teach her students how to use  turntables— “It’s very important to learn these if you want to DJ,” she said—she uses the program Ableton Live in her work and praises its power in remixing and synthesizing disparate sources. “If you were a turntable DJ in 1985, you had two turntables and two hands. If you have Ableton Live, it’s sort of like you have infinite hands,” Hankins said.
Yet remixing—or, more generally, creatively interpreting preexisting material—isn’t the only way artists can gain from having access to broad digital resources. Scott Zigler, the director of the A.R.T. Institute for Advanced Theater Training and the instructor of the theater intensive, explained to students like Selina Y. Wang ’15 how digital media can be valuable for actors seeking reference material. “Right now he’s putting on a play about crystal meth users, and now you can just go on YouTube and see how people act on crystal meth,” Wang said. “He’s mixing method acting with technology,” added Lelaina E. Vogel ’15, another theater intensive student.
As students explored different ways to use these resources, their activity invigorated the space at Arts @ 29 Garden. It is a peculiar building; its linoleum tiles suggest a high school, while the stark concrete ceilings and glass walls evoke a downtown gallery. That strange combination, fitting for the theme of the intensives, was one of many present during the session; at any given moment, a visiting observer might hear students remixing a song by rapper Killah Priest while others tried to find the perfect spot for a performance art piece and still others listened to a recording of poet Amiri Baraka reading his elegy for John Coltrane. Due to the glass walls of the classrooms, it was easy for a visitor to look in on these moments of creative expression.
“It kind of reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Rear Window.’ You’re getting little glimpses into people’s lives,” said online media intensive instructor Joseph L. Bergen when he showed his students “Out My Window,” an interactive documentary produced by the National Film Board of Canada. The work compiles videos, photos, and voice-overs detailing the lives of people who live in high-rises around the globe; Bergen showed it, with numerous other online documentaries, to get his students to think about techniques used online to create a sense of identity.
Bergen’s comparison to “Rear Window” is apt; there is a voyeuristic appeal to these intimate snapshots of private life.  But as a student said of “One Millionth Tower,” another National Film Board of Canada production about high-rises, these works also convey the vibrancy of a place. Like Neil Simon’s “California Suite” or Georges Perec’s “Life: A User’s Manual,” these are works that derive their power from the collective weight of overlapping stories and insights.
As Killah Priest boomed next door to Bergen’s lecture, it seemed entirely possible that the comfortably noisy environment of Arts @ 29 Garden during the intensives might have served as sufficient source material for a similar work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s no coincidence that the Harvard Art Museums are located steps away from the Carpenter Center, which houses undergraduate studio art classes. Solid brick walls separate works that have been deemed worthy of exhibition from those which have not—or, at least, not yet. The work of students at the Carpenter Center is years of practice and thought away from being considered alongside the works of a museum, assuming the students have the potential to be great artists in the first place. How can students become capable of producing artwork at such a high level? Can an unskilled beginner, after taking the right mix of classes, start in one building and end up showing work in its more prestigious neighbor? Many students stake their education on the assumption that creativity can be taught, but the potential of arts education to form talented artists remains open for debate.
NOVICES AND NATURALS
Arts instructors disagree as to whether talent or training contributes more to one’s creative success. According to Zachary C. Sifuentes ’99, a visiting lecturer on Visual & Environmental Studies and expository writing preceptor, artistic ability can be fostered in the classroom. “I’ve learned the past few years that Harvard students don’t really need to be taught. They need to be given the opportunity to learn something new, something complicated, something fascinating,” he wrote in an email.
Sifuentes leads a freshman seminar, “Pressing the Page: Making Art with Letters, Paper & Ink,” this term on the letterpress and typographical art. “Students can absolutely learn to make art, and I think this is especially true of students who don’t think of themselves as artists…. It’s showing students what’s possible and giving them the opportunity to test out those possibilities. And when they do, they do incredible work,” he wrote.
Sifuentes’ opinions on the potential of arts education are distinctly optimistic: given encouragement and guidance, students and their artistic output will flourish. Not all instructors share this view. Visiting Professor of English Henri Cole, who teaches a poetry workshop, draws a line between talent and accomplishment. “I don’t think you can teach talent. I think you can nurture and guide and coax it….The goal isn’t necessarily making a fantastic poem.”
If you cannot teach talent, then what can be taught? Technical artistic skills can be improved by adequate training. But given the explosion in non-traditional art forms over the last half-century, there remains the question of whether manual skills like sighting angles, mixing paint, and stretching canvas are relevant in today’s art world.  VES concentrator, Clarissa M. Hart ’14 believes these skills still have a place. “The thing about classical training is that to really be a good artist you have to get experience in as many fields as possible, so if people cut out classical training…then I think they’re missing out on a new perspective,” says Hart.
“There’s no need to re-invent the wheel if someone has already figured an easy method,” says Robert D. Dolori ’15, a guitarist who composes music. “I think if you teach yourself an instrument or an art or a skill, you’re really going to see that differently than someone who has taken more classes and is classically trained, which could be an advantage…but, at the same time [you] might miss out on more traditional techniques that might have improved [your] art.”
Another downside to the do-it-yourself approach is a lack of guidance.  Hal Glicksman,  former associate director of the Center for the Educational Applications of Brain Hemisphere Research at California State University, Long Beach, would agree: “I believe that [creativity] can be taught in the classroom…creative assignments—go out and find 50 different red things and see how they relate and put them together in a design—the crazy things that you throw out in design classes really do work,” he said.
Assignments require students to constantly create; the practice in itself contributes to their development. “In a sense my goal is to push people to make as much work as they can,” says Matthew Saunders, a visiting lecturer on VES.
What happens to the work of those artists who try to break into the art world without classical training? A lucky up-and-comer might find success in the Chicago-based exhibition space Intuit, the only non profit organization in the U.S. that is dedicated solely to presenting self-taught and outsider art. Cleo Wilson, executive director of the museum, said that it continues to be difficult for untrained artists to compete in the art world. “Galleries, that is commercial galleries, have their own niches. They don’t show outsider art. There are [only] a few outsider artists that have been accepted by museums into the mainstream.” Artists who do not go through formal training produce noticeably different end products from those who do, which may account for the disparity in success. “They use non-traditional materials, there’s a different passion, and they’re not looking to academia or the traditional world for what their art should look like, so it’s not reflective of [artists like] Michelangelo.” Despite the flourishing of non-conventional art forms, the route to success in the artistic community is less laissez-faire than one might expect. A lack of artistic education does not necessarily undermine potential, but according to Wilson,  it makes eminence significantly harder to attain.
 ARTISTES VERSUS ELEPHANTS
After shopping Saunder’s “Postcards from Volcanoes” painting class, I take a moment to unwind in the silence of the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. The first floor features a collection of well-known abstract and modern art; there’s a 1950 splattered canvas by Jackson Pollock hanging near a familiar 1922 geometric painting by Piet Mondrian. The skeptical response to such works, from those suspicious of or uninitiated into Modernist painting, is a surefire whine: “I could have made that!” Science, however, says otherwise.
A 2011 study co-led by Boston College’s Professor of Psychology Ellen Winner and PhD candidate Angelina Hawley-Dolan, investigated whether people could distinguish between abstract paintings created by professional artists with formal training and those created by children, monkeys, chimps, and elephants. The study found that people favored the professional works, even when they were falsely labeled as amateur pieces. “People untrained in visual art see more than they realize when looking at abstract expressionist paintings,” said Winner in the study’s conclusion. “People may say that a child could have made a work by a recognized abstract expressionist, but when forced to choose between a work by a child and one by a master such as Rothko, they are drawn to the Rothko…. People see the mind behind the art.”
The study argues that a qualitative difference exists between the work of formally taught artists and animal amateurs, even in the less restrictive medium of abstract art. If classical training makes a substantial difference even to the unexperienced eye, then the impact of arts education is significant.  Yet Winner has her doubts about the potential of education to create artists.“I think that training cannot make someone picked at random into a prodigy or a great creator,” Winner wrote in an email.  Winner is a former member of Project Zero, an educational research group at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). Project Zero’s mission is to understand and enhance learning, thinking, and creativity in the arts as well as the humanities and sciences. In her 2008 paper “Toward Broadening the Definition of Giftedness,” Winner concluded, “Environmental stimulation, personality, and temperament variables can promote or strangle giftedness but cannot created giftedness out of normality.”  If genius artists are that way as a function of their genes and environments, then the implications are dire for aspiring artists lacking raw talent.
 DRIVE AND CRAFT
Other researchers have approached the question of whether art can be taught from a scientific perspective; Glicksman is more optimistic than Winner. “Talent is strange because there [are] definitely people who are smarter than other people and more talented…but everybody can learn a high degree of skill,” says  Glicksman.
At the Center for Educational Applications of Brain Hemisphere Research, Glicksman was involved in continuing the work of Dr. Betty Edwards, an art professor whose 1979 book “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain” changed the standards of visual art instruction. The book, grounded in brain hemisphere research, emphasized focusing on the relationships between different components of an image rather than trying to draw what the artist thought something should look like.
“All these people who say ‘I can’t draw’ because they don’t have some innate ability really can learn to draw with complete realism and skill, up to a certain level,” Glicksman says. He distinguishes between the ability to paint or draw realistically and the ability to be creative; drawing is a learnable technique, a tool that can get you closer to artistic accomplishment.  However, a piece of visual art needs innate intent and vision to be successful.
Glicksman’s discrimination between the ability to become technically proficient and create visionary new work is a subtle but significant distinction.  Perhaps the disparity lies in the individual’s intrinsic motivation and inspiration.  “It’s good to have training, but first you have to have determination. You have to have something to say,” says Memory P. Risinger, who teaches the Freshman Fiction Writing Workshop. According to Risinger, successful writers are those who keep writing because of an internal desire to create, not because they are compelled by external rewards. If it is true that intrinsic desire must precede training, then the question of teaching art becomes more complicated; the most effective teaching techniques may fall flat if a student does not feel internally motivated to make art.
 CYBORG COMPOSERS
Perhaps the best way to determine whether art is teachable is to delineate creativity into divisible components and try teaching it to a machine. Harvard professor Krzysztof Gajos defines creativity in the same formulaic fashion he might create an algorithm. “Creativity is novelty plus quality plus surprise,” he says.   Another researcher attempted to teach creativity to a machine and succeeded, but not without creating controversy.
University of Santa Cruz researcher David Cope created a computer program in the 1990s called Experiments in Musical Intelligence, nicknamed Emmy. Emmy’s more efficacious successor, Emily Howell, is a daughter program that successfully composes original, modern music. Emily Howell produced full musical scores modeled off the work of classical composers and eventually published an album. The end products were so convincingly made that music scholars were unable to tell they were artificially generated, raising questions about the importance of human creativity.
Nevertheless, Emily Howell still needed a human to sort through the computer-produced sequences. According to Gajos, a creative work has two distinguishing characteristics. First, it combines things that we have never seen before. Second, it breaks an implicit constraint. Salted caramel, Gajos gives as an example, was a creative dessert invention because it broke the implicit boundary between sweets and savory flavorings. “It takes enormous insight to figure out what these implicit constraints are,” says Gajos. It is a formidable challenge for a machine.
I listened to the computer-generated album “Emily Howell: From Darkness, Light” and though the chords formally sounded fine, the music struck me as strangely hollow and lacking singularity. People find themselves drawn to certain art works not simply because they are beautiful, but because they communicate something about the human mind on the production side; this emotional understanding cannot be taught to a machine.
 SKILL SPILLS OVER
Although opinions differ on the degree to which artistic ability can be taught, most agree that the rewards of art instruction extend beyond the final product. The educated can become more intellectually courageous, more critically aware, more confident.
Sheema Golbaba ’14, a documentary filmmaker, knows firsthand that VES classes can have significant spillover effects. Golbaba’s VES professor transformed her initial idea for her final project, but the interaction changed more than what she turned in that semester. “Learning to be a little more open-minded [in my VES class] and to think about things in [different ways] helped me a lot, not only in my development as a person…but also [in] my other classes….I said, ‘I need to do something I’m a little uncomfortable with.’ And I don’t think I would have done that had I not been challenged previously.”
Firsthand accounts like Golbaba’s of students learning broadly applicable lessons through the study of art abound, but scientific research lags behind on substantiating these claims with evidence. In 2006, Winner and other researchers at the School of Education combed through ten studies dating back to 1950 on the effects of arts education in primary and secondary schools. In the majority of cases, there was no relationship between arts instruction and a boost in students’ academic accomplishments, but Winner and her fellow researchers did identify several other “studio habits of mind” that correlate with art instruction: persistence and engagement, express abstract concepts, creative risk-taking, observation, reflection, and knowledge of the art world.
Shari Tishman, director of Project Zero at the School of Education, says the question we really should be asking is not whether we can teach art but what the goals of this instruction are. “Developing technical expertise is only one of many [goals]…. Other goals might include teaching students how to think creatively, how to observe closely, how to pose interesting problems, how to look beyond the obvious, how to engage in productive critique, and how to look for balance and rightness of fit.  If these sorts of things are goals, it doesn’t make sense to design [a] curriculum or evaluations that focus predominantly on the somewhat esoteric goal of high-level technical expertise.” To Tishman, if expertise is not the goal of art instruction, then the answer to the question of whether art can be taught is changed dramatically, and perhaps the methodology of art education should change as well.
It’s a valid point, especially in a community that expects a high level of success in every endeavor. Not all works that start at the Carpenter Center will end up on display in one of the  galleries next door, but what students learn in the process of creation, from prose to painting, is inherently valuable. “The function of a writing class is similar to the function of reading. It helps young people to become themselves,” says Cole. “That’s the goal of the university at large....The end result is sometimes terrific poems and sometimes it is less terrific poems, but that is less important than becoming yourself.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the center of the Kirkland House Junior Common Room sits renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76. He seems modest, almost inconspicuous, as if he is not the night’s primary focus. The lights dim. From the font of the room comes a subdued hum of the strummed mandolin, a gentle thumping on the Indian tabla drums, and the unmistakable tones of two violins and a clarinet. The tuning stops, and a flurry of notes erupts from the mandolin, joined quickly by the clarinet’s tumultuous bars. Back and forth, the two instruments dominate the first part of the melodic folk piece, the foreground to the rhythmic plucking of the violin and the forceful shaking of the tambourine. This piece, David Bruce’s “Cut the Rug,” was one of four compositions featured in the Silk Road Ensemble’s Learning from Performers presentation on Jan. 23.
Created and directed by Ma, the Ensemble embodies the cultural exchange of the historic trade route for which it is named. Its musicians hail from more than 20 countries, a combination that allows them to bring together the traditional sounds of a variety of cultures. “People encounter and live in a world in which many kinds of music exist simultaneously in the same place,” said music professor Anne C. Shreffler. “The Silk Road Ensemble is a personification of this vision of a multi-musical, multilingual world.” After a week-long collaborative effort between the Ensemble and four composers, the performance musically expressed this cross-cultural vision by revealing the works-in-progress of Bruce, Vijay Iyer, Glenn Kotche, and Kojiro Umezaki.
All of the composers had the same set of instruments and musicians at their disposal, yet no two pieces seemed to draw from the same influences. Instead, the four works comprised a musical odyssey. Bruce’s four-part “Cut the Rug” in itself was an expedition through joy and sorrow. “There’s a kind of journey throughout the piece,” Bruce said. “You can kind of think of it as three dances and a funeral.” Jaunty, swift notes from the clarinet and mandolin combined with the sporadic but rhythmic percussion to create the lighter aspect of the folk piece. As the excited trill of the clarinet was replaced by the melancholic melody of the bagpipe-like Spanish gaita, the piece entered its sepulchral march, only to be reawakened by an energized, up-tempo rhythm created by the lighter sounds of the clarinet and string instruments. “The last movement is sort of defiant of death,” said Bruce.
Iyer’s piece, entitled “Playlist for an Extreme Occasion,” is similarly composed of several tonally distinct segments, such that it feels indeed like a playlist of musical sketches. The rolling cadence of the tabla trembling under the jarring chords from the gaita and cello gave some sections the impression of ordered chaos; the more subdued segments were marked by either the Chinese sheng mouth organ’s airy notes or the soft playing of the piano. This dynamic exploration of sound was not entirely Iyer’s creation. “There are moments of improvisation in the piece where I hand it over to different musicians in the ensemble as if to say, ‘Well, enough about me; what do you think of me?’” Iyer said.  As a sort of extension of the collaborative process, the spontaneous contributions of the Ensemble complemented Iyer’s vision of an extreme piece.
Kotche, who is also the drummer for the rock band Wilco, was unable to be present at the performance, but the Ensemble managed his difficult piece masterfully. The composer used the birthdays of his family members to choose the time signatures for “Mille Etoiles,” and unusual signatures such as 21/8 and 23/8 proved challenging for the Ensemble during rehearsals. “This piece is about a sense of trust,” bassist Jeffrey Beecher said. “It was a little bit vulnerable for all of us to play in [21/8], but I think we were all excited.” From the xylophone’s spirited introduction to the piece’s climactic end, “Mille Etoiles” explored the capabilities of the percussion section, alternating between moments of explosive chaos and tight focus.
Umezaki’s “Side In Side Out” drew rich influence from the composer’s Japanese heritage. Kabuki theatre, epic story telling, regional customs—each aspect was explored through the airy sounds of the shakuhachi flute, which Umezaki himself played. Quick, rhythmic melodies tapered off into slow, somber scores, then resurged with a vengeance during the piece’s ending crescendo, a resounding finish to a dynamic cultural story.
The musicians themselves seemed to feel every minute of the pieces, as they swayed with the softer lulls and jerked with the tumultuous rhythms. Responding in kind, the audience passed tranquil moments with eyes closed and subtle smiles. That relationship established between listener and performer seemed a fitting reflection of the Ensemble’s spirit of connection.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At one minute after midnight on the morning of Thursday, Jan. 19, Avery Leonard ’14 and Eric R. Brewster ’14 started off a friendly phone chat like so many other casual conversations: They talked about the weather. Any semblance of conversational normalcy ended there. Over the course of their discussion, the pair was taunted, caressed, insulted, harassed, massaged, pelted with towels, drawn on and even flashed, sometimes by complete strangers. By the time they finally hung up the phone, over 46 hours later, a world record had potentially been broken in a project that hoped to challenge traditional practices of performance and social norms of conversation. With this performance art piece, entitled “(for the purpose of catching ourselves in the act of being the most),” the Harvard Generalist made its debut.
The group’s founding members first began meeting in the basement of Holworthy more than a year ago. Leonard and Brewster were among a group of then-freshmen that gathered to discuss issues ranging from art to their expectations for college to observations of social intolerance. “It was this collaborative environment where we brought all these people from different academic and extracurricular arenas and collected them together into this sort of brain trust,” Generalist member Tyler M. Richard ’14 says.
The members became close friends, and their conversations delved for hours into the abstract and hypothetical. “It’s the kind of thing a certain kind of person becomes addicted to,” Leonard says.
Hailing from a variety of artistic and academic backgrounds, the future members of the Generalist all shared the desire to turn their artistically experimental discussions into something they could share with the world. “Our group always rallied around having wild, fun, absurd artistic ambitions,” Ginny C. Fahs ’14 says. They decided in the fall of 2011 to realize these ambitions with the Generalist—so named, Mariel N. Pettee ’14 explains, to signify the diversity of artistic capabilities represented by the group’s members. In keeping with their collaborative ethic, the Generalist functions as a collective, making decisions and authoring their projects all together with no strict power hierarchy.
The members also felt Harvard had an artistic niche that needed to be filled. “Looking around the extracurricular community at Harvard, there are a ton of arts organizations, there are a ton of writing organizations, there are literary or performance organizations, but we noticed there was one gaping hole, which I guess you could call social installation art,” Brewster says.
The Generalist’s work is meant to play with the traditional division between performer and audience. “As audience members, there are so many times when we want to clap or express some sort of outward expression of how we’re feeling or how it’s affecting us, but typically we’re expected to mostly remain silent,” says Pettee, who directed the debut performance.
Rather than demanding passive observation, installations of this sort are designed so audience members can play an active role and express themselves, thereby also making art more accessible. “That’s a tone we hope to strike, that we can be playing with this community and inspiring a conversation rather than having art be this distanced thing that people feel like they can’t talk to or about because they feel like they don’t have the capacity to understand it,” Fahs says.
But Generalist members also hope their pieces lead participants to reexamine social conventions and common interactions, like  phone calls. “For two days continuously, people are coming in, they’re interacting with each other, and they’re having conversations, and they’re experimenting with new social norms because the context in which they’re having these interactions is so strange,” Leonard says of the debut piece.
In that vein, the group plans to create installations that replicate everyday social situations but push the audience to understand them in new ways.  “At Harvard, everyone has their own opinions, their own lives, their own 6,000 activities, and all we really strive to do is make people think,” Brewster says.
Richard relates their first performance to idea of the “gesamtkunstwerk,” or total work of art. “It embodies the ethos of the [Generalist],” he says.
The performance was playful and interactive while defying standard performance practices and making a subtle statement about contemporary culture’s exploitative emphasis on competition. “I think it was a really good first project for us just because it’s such a ridiculous, over-the-top, ambitious feat that it’ll really get our name out there,” Pettee says. “If we have more of a presence on campus, people might realize that art is such a universal thing—it really makes us human in a lot of ways.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mr. President, congratulations on being elected. I’ll take you up to the Oval Office in a moment. Just leave your coat here. Religious? Well and good, sir. Just remember not to take any of that religion stuff in with you, either. Why don’t you tuck it all behind this, and I’ll have it primed for pick-up in four years when you get out. Feeling sufficiently secularized? Perfect. Now let’s go craft some public policy.
In our secular age, many would like for these words to adorn the White House welcome mat. Religion is fine, the prevailing secular wisdom dictates, but keep it out of the public sphere. Don’t let it influence stem cell policy or gay marriage laws. Or take the word from the Declaration in Defense of Science and Secularism, a document the Center for Inquiry released a few years ago which indicts political leaders for allowing religion “to shape public policy,” and calls for legislation “based on secular principles, not religious doctrine.” The document has since accumulated an all-star roster of signers—including our own Steven A. Pinker.
After eight years of a Bible-thumping president whose hobby appeared to be waging crusades (his word, not mine) in non-Christian countries, this phobia of religion-fueled politics seems, well, justified. But it isn’t. Rather, it is grounded in a theory of government—liberalism—that is profoundly unfair to believers. Let’s see why.
By liberalism, I don’t mean that set of beliefs that is “politically left” or held by democrats. I mean the enlightenment era doctrine that holds that the purpose of government is not to force on its citizenry a conception of “the good,” but rather to allow its citizens to pursue individually what they each take to be good. (As President, you may be Christian, but let your citizens worship whom they may.) Liberalism is motivated by the idea that government must somehow produce order from a mishmash of wrangling individuals. Since faith is the queen bee of conversation-stoppers, we can move forward only if, as the declaration of secularism says, “we are willing to put personal religious beliefs aside when we craft public policy."
The liberal government functions not by promoting any particular conception of what is valuable, but by ensuring the right of the citizen to pursue whatever she takes to be valuable. Liberal government itself stays neutral with respect to matters concerning value. So eager secularists might appeal to liberalism in the following way: Public policy should always be grounded in non-religious principles for otherwise government would be imposing onto the public a particular and idiosyncratic vision of what counts as a life worth living.
Although this liberal tradition is appealing, there are good reasons to reject it. It demands that government stay neutral between competing conceptions of what is valuable only by smuggling into public discourse its own values through the back door. Liberal governments can justify their refusal to “legislate morality” only by appealing to their own ideals—autonomy, freedom of expression, hands-off-ishness. The public sphere is necessarily value-laden and, like a revolving door, one can keep some out only by keeping others in.
What is more, the liberal and secular values of autonomy and freedom are not necessarily the values prized by the most religious. The argument for liberal government gets no purchase on certain believers; it begs the question against them. Various religious traditions emphasize not being master of thyself but subservience to something larger, not unadulterated freedom but rather freedom mitigated by the dictates of a benevolent Creator.
The crux of liberalism is that it demands, in the words of one writer, “that we recognize rights for what (we believe) is wrong.” This demand, far from being just another view liberal government can merely accommodate, must be a principle that liberal government imposes onto its citizenry. And a government that requires its public sphere to be “purified” of religion can impose this value only by unfairly burdening the religious. For liberalism demands that believers enter public dialogue stripped-down—or as Stephen Carter of Yale writes, “only after leaving behind that part of themselves that they may consider the most vital.” Non-believers, on the other hand, are not forced to check their principles at the door.
Some secularists contend that even if banishing religion from the public sphere is unfair to believers, we must still do so because it is pragmatic. (If Congress spent its time arguing over scripture, how could it ever get to that debt ceiling?) Yet this reply fails. To “privatize” religion in the name of pragmatism is itself to import normative assumptions about which kinds of public conversations are worth having, about whether government should sacrifice fairness for practicality, and these are assumptions that many believers are likely to reject. Once again, the argument begs the question against the devout.
Granted, those who wish to bar religion from policy-making have justified fears of religious intolerance infecting the public square. But this may be a case where extremes meet. As the effort to privatize religion shows, the intolerance emanates from both sides.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Cheryl Sandberg has said that one of the biggest obstacles to women achieving success and respect is a lack of confidence and bravery to voice their ideas. Specifically, she suggests, “We need to teach women to raise their hands more.”  With all due respect to Ms. Sandberg, a hesitancy to speak up is not necessarily the main reason women have trouble becoming successful. It can be, but at least in the academic setting of Harvard the problem is not that women are afraid to speak up and are too shy to raise their hands. We do raise our hands. The problem is that once female students are called on, we often fail to articulate our ideas and arguments as confidently as male students do.
This is a very broad statement and deserves explanation. From personal experience it seems to me that in the academic setting of Harvard, female students and male students raise their hands with about the same frequency. Both contribute, in section and in lecture, at roughly equal rates. I also cannot discern any difference in quality between the ideas and comments of male and female students.
The big difference lies in how those ideas are expressed. Generally when male students express an idea, they express it loudly and in a confident tone. Even if the subject is not something they are particularly familiar with, they address the issue confrontationally. Female students, on the other hand, tend to speak up in a very different, and often less effective, way. They often laugh in a self-deprecating manner after their comment and if they are not sure about what they are saying, female students will usually tell the class: “I’m not sure about this, but…” or “This may sound stupid, but…” One could say that honesty about what one knows is a commendable trait, but in the classroom, it detracts from what the student is saying. An intelligent remark will now have a stamp of “inadequacy” placed upon it that taints the argument.
Perhaps the worst habit is the apology. In my experience, it is common to hear girls reply to a classmate’s comment in the following way: “I have to say that I disagree with that–sorry!–and think this.” Yet it is extremely rare to hear an apology for a disagreement ever come from a male student. Again, this apologetic style detracts from the weight of the speaker’s words. Even though the reason for the disagreement is usually valid and intelligent, it is impossible to take it seriously when the speaker has apologized for it as if it were something to be ashamed of.
What is the source of this female timidity? Why is it so prevalent? One very persuasive theory is that girls are constantly afraid of coming on “too strong” or “too intense” in the classroom for fear it may damage their popularity or make them seem unlikeable. An EdChange study on Gender Bias in Education asserts that girls from a very young age are socialized to view assertiveness as an essentially masculine quality. The study argues that, “Assertive behavior from girls is often seen as disruptive and may be viewed more negatively by adults.”
Another study shows that as they enter adolescence, the pressure to be “feminine” greatly affects how girls speak and state their opinions. They feel the pressure to be “proper, pleasing, quiet, and nice,” and are afraid of coming off as disruptive or “too loud.” From experience in the classroom at Harvard, it seems that this fear and these pressures often comes into play in girls’ behavior, either by not talking in class or, more commonly, by talking in class but doing so apologetically and bashfully. Women at Harvard are proud of their intellect and opinion and possibly would deny that they are thinking of other people’s judgments when they speak up. Their behavior, then, is perhaps subconscious and exists as a result of habits established long ago.
Of course, this tendency to self-deprecate does not exist in all female students, just as assertiveness is not a quality associated with all male students. There are students of both genders that completely defy this trend and characterization. But it seems to be much more likely for women to detract from the importance of their statements and to diminish their own arguments. We, as fellow students and peers, need to correct this. If we as women notice that we keep watering down our points, we should actively try to stop it. And if we notice a friend doing it, we should point it out so that they can improve as well. It may be an awkward conversation but it will be an important and useful one.
An ability to express a conviction is surely crucial. At a university filled with dynamic, intelligent, ambitious women, it is frustrating that there is such pervasive self-deprecation and humility. We, as female students, should be just as confident and outspoken in our ideas in the classroom as men are. There is no need to apologize for an opinion, however controversial it may be. Let’s keep raising our hands, and when we’re called on, let’s raise the bar in our confidence to express ourselves.

In 1958, Stephen Kuffler was invited to come from Johns Hopkins Medical School to Harvard Medical School to become a full professor in the Department of Pharmacology. He brought with him four post-doctoral fellows: Torsten Wiesel, Ed Furshpan, David Potter, and myself. Along with Ed Kravitz, we formed the nucleus that led to the founding of the Department of Neurobiology five years later.
When we arrived, Harvard Medical  School was directed by one dean—George Parker Berry. He was assisted by a genius, Henry Meadow, who joined HMS in 1950 as executive secretary to the Committee on Research and Development. The two of them ran the whole school. Berry was grouchy and firm-handed and what he said was law.
In subsequent years, Berry was succeeded by four deans at the Medical School: Robert H. Ebert, Daniel C. Tosteson, Joseph B. Martin, and our present dean, Jeffrey S. Flier. With each successive dean, the dean's office increased in size, with the addition of associate deans and assistant deans. A graph showing “Number of Deans” as the ordinate and “Year” as abscissa would tell the story at a glance.
The list of HMS deans of various categories today runs one and a quarter pages long. Academic deans, nine in all, include an executive dean for research, a dean for faculty affairs, a dean for medical education, one for graduate education, one for clinical and translational research, one for students, one for diversity and community partnership, and one for academic and clinical affairs. Administrative deans are also nine in number (five are associate deans). Finally comes the Council of Academic Deans, of whom there are four. You can find the list on the Internet, under Harvard  Medical School under “Deans” on the Harvard Medical School Website.
But if you think that is a mouthful, you should see the list of FAS administrators. My printout runs to over 16 pages. I haven't counted up the various kinds of FAS deans, but the list dwarfs that of the Medical  School.
At a reception prior to a meeting of the Cambridge Scientific Club some weeks ago, I got talking with Henry Rosovsky, who was Dean of FAS from 1973-84. I asked him how many deans of various kinds there were when he held the office. He held up an index finger, "one,” and he pointed to himself, "me."
There are certainly many reasons besides top-heavy administration for the skyrocketing costs of a college education. Harvard has grown to be much larger and more complicated in the last half-century, and its administration has obviously done the same. But I would suggest that the administration’s growth has outrun that of the University.
In his State of the Union address, President Obama decried the ever-rising cost of attending college. Only yesterday, the Crimson opined on the increasing expensiveness of a college education. The next time that Harvard undergraduates and medical students ask themselves why their fees are so high, they could estimate the annual salaries and expenses of the various deans, their secretaries, and assistants—and do some arithmetic.
David H. Hubel is the John Franklin Enders Professor of Neurobiology, Emeritus, at Harvard Medical School. He was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Torsten Wiesel for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual cortex. He has taught the Freshman seminar, which he is offering this spring, “The Neurophysiology of Visual Perception” for ten years running.

Harvard has long faced criticism, including from this newspaper, over its lack of social space. Without locations on campus that facilitate interaction between diverse sectors of the Harvard community, many undergraduates have been driven off campus to institutions—final clubs for example—that are far from ideal for social interaction. Meanwhile, during this economic downturn, organizations throughout the world, be they governments, businesses, or universities, have been forced to adopt austerity measures that limit spending and emphasize fiscal restraint. Harvard students themselves have fallen victim to this curtailment, as evidenced by the absence of hot breakfasts in the twelve upperclass Houses. This time, however, Harvard College’s administration deserves commendation for taking steps in establishing and supporting potential solutions to its social space woes in spite of an uncertain fiscal climate. The latest indication that the school is committed to change is its recent decision to fund Cabot Café, the student-operated coffeehouse that has become a popular destination in the Quad.
The College and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences granted the café $70,000 that will be used to add power outlets, improve lighting and kitchen equipment, and adorn the walls with student artwork. Jesse J. Kaplan ’13, the founder and general manager of Cabot Café, claims 50 to 100 students frequented the coffeehouse each night during its inaugural semester, a number that is sure to rise as the word about the establishment spreads. The café has already garnered popularity on campus and will likely continue to do so after current renovations improve the already attractive atmosphere. Undergrads who live in the Quad badly need more space to relax in a non-residential setting that is nonetheless close to their homes. We are excited about the future of the venue, which has become a popular place for friends and classmates to convene on campus.
The support of Cabot Café, a student creation, is the latest in a concerted effort on Harvard’s part to enhance student life. Another undertaking of note is the establishment of the ice rink outside the Science Center, the latest in a series of efforts from the Common Spaces program. While some of the actions of the program have been lackluster, “Harvard Skate” is an innovative way to provide students the opportunity to interact with one another in an unconventional setting. The rink operates with free admissions, the only fee being a five-dollar skate rental for those who do not possess their own pair. This high level of affordability is an impressive demonstration of Harvard’s desire to respond to criticisms about the availability of such recreational spaces with a fun and affordable option. Hopefully, the administration will continue to recognize the benefits of endeavors like the recent opening of Cabot Café and the ice rink, and will strive to take further necessary steps to make this school a more open and enjoyable place.

I am a Muslim, but when I travel to the “Muslim world,” I certainly do not feel like one. I wish to neither disrespect the culture nor my sense of self, so I would never dress like a typical tourist in denim shorts, but at the same time wearing a headscarf has never felt right for me. I wear traditional attire for individual prayer, but my faith has always left me comfortable to leave it at that. In various parts of the Arab world, however, uncovered hair is equated with promiscuity.  Such dress is responded to with catcalls, suggestive glares, and not-so-subtle propositions. If I cover my hair, I feel as though I am submitting to the notion that a woman’s presence should be muted, or that she does not deserve the respect of her fellow human beings. Yet if I do not cover my hair, I feel an even greater disconnect from the very Muslim identity that I came to the region to reclaim. The Muslim world’s use of physical appearance as an indicator of valid religious faith undermines the more essential elements of Islam. The culturally enforced mistreatment of nontraditional women makes me ashamed that this region has come to represent my religion.
Two years ago I traveled to Morocco with a small group of American high school students to study Arabic and culture. I felt an advantage immediately once I arrived. I knew the prayers (although my Shi’a prayers differed slightly with Morocco’s Sunni tradition), and I was familiar with the appropriate house and religious etiquette. My assumed homecoming was quickly shattered, however, when my host sister informed me that many Moroccans would not believe her when she said I was a Muslim. Why not, I asked her, confused. She ventured that perhaps it was because I am from America. When I pointed out that no one seemed to question the validity of a fellow Muslim woman in the group, she replied, of course: she wears a hijab. A Moroccan teacher begged that same hijab-wearing student to go to the mosque with her, but when the student declined and suggested that I might accompany her the teacher dropped the subject all together. On a cab ride home from school one evening, I made the mistake of speaking English to the cab driver, who asked where I was from. I explained briefly that I was American and explained my Muslim background. This man, with the rosary hanging from his mirror and scripture lining his dashboard, proceeded to ask if I would be willing to meet him at a hotel later and offered a free cab ride in exchange for a kiss. I declined, respectfully, and ran from the cab.
To be fair, these instances could have been a result of the misrepresentation of American women—Sex and the City 2 was playing in Moroccan cinemas at the time—but his actions were still unacceptable, especially for a man of professed piety.  If traditional Muslim garb betrays modesty, why is it that any women who does not dress in the culturally prescribed manner becomes immediately susceptible to objectification by the same men insisting upon Islamic dress? Are women supposed to guide the moral behavior of men?
The Gulf Region of Kuwait, which I visited last month, mandates Sharia law as well, but differs from Morocco in that there is little tourism. The country embodies American consumerism and material wealth, and has an underclass of poor immigrants. Kuwaiti citizens are visually distinguisheable from Bangladeshi and Philippine immigrants by their burkas and keffiyahs (traditional Arab headdress for men). In one instance, I watched as a Kuwaiti family enjoyed authentic American cuisine at Applebee’s while their maid, an immigrant from the Philippines, sat in a corner and watched. At this moment, I finally understood the problem with a people so focused on their collective religious appearance. Although Islamic law emphasizes feeding the hungry and treating all as equals, such practices do not receive as much adherence in the Middle East as dressing in the culturally designated way. It is a lot harder to mandate compassion and generosity than it is to require the superficial trappings of religion, because the latter is visible to the naked eye. When you try to turn what should be a personal relationship into collective action, you eliminate the understanding and choice that make faith valuable. When a woman decides to wear a headscarf, it should be because she wishes to act morally and appear modest, not because it is a cultural norm or law.
Religion is by nature open to interpretation and therefore cannot be standardized. There are more than 70 sects of Islam, and religious conflict between them during the past few centuries only highlights the fact that Islam cannot be understood in one way alone.  By merging religious scripture with the law, nations like Kuwait are trying to enforce upon their citizens something that ought to be enriched by personal choice. As a result, the essential characteristics of Islam are lost, as is the hope that it will be sympathetically understood across the globe.

After launching an exploratory website on Monday, Harvard Law School alumnus Joseph P. Kennedy III is one step closer to declaring his candidacy for the Massachusetts District Four Congressional Seat, according to Kennedy aides and local politicos.
Over the past month, Kennedy has moved towards officially declaring his candidacy for the seat, currently held by retiring Congressman Barney Frank ’61-’62. Kennedy announced on Jan. 5 that he planned to form an exploratory committee. Then on Jan. 20 Kennedy stepped down from his post at the Middlesex County prosecutor’s office.
“I’d be very surprised if he doesn’t announce in the month,” former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara said.
The website provides news updates on Kennedy and allows supporters to donate to the potential candidate.
“Joe is thinking about running now precisely because [of] the difficult times we are in and the broken state of our politics in Washington,” Kennedy’s spokesman, Kyle Sullivan, wrote in an email Monday. “There are critical issues facing the 4th district right now, and Joe believes that we need to do more to create new jobs, provide better educational opportunities, and restore common sense and fairness in Congress.”
Last week, Boston City Councillor Michael P. Ross disbanded his own exploratory committee, leaving Kennedy the clear Democratic frontrunner according to DiCara.
On the Republican side, Harvard Kennedy School alumnus Sean Bielat has emerged as the Republican frontrunner, DiCara said. Bielat, a former Marine, lost to Frank by a narrow margin when he ran for the seat two years ago.
Kennedy is the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the son of former Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy’s candidacy would mark the first time  a member of the Massachusetts political family has run for office since the death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 in 2009.
The 31-year-old Kennedy graduated from Stanford and Harvard Law School, where he worked extensively in the legal aid office.
He then spent two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic and has since worked as a lawyer for Middlesex County and the Cape and Island District Attorney’s office.

Hoping to connect with Cambridge’s many college students, the Cambridge Police Department officially launched their new smartphone application, My Police Department, or MyPD.
“The college students are the big smartphone users,” said CPD Director of Communications and Media Relations Daniel M. Riviello. “We want to evolve in the way that communication evolves.”
MyPD, available free of charge on all iPhones and Androids, allows locals to report information about crimes related to drugs, bullying, graffiti, and traffic issues. Residents can also submit a picture or GPS coordinates along with their tip.
In addition to reporting tips, residents can ask for directions, provide feedback, and look at profiles of their neighborhood sergeants.
Riviello said that since MyPD’s soft launch earlier this month, the CPD has seen an uptick in tips reported.
“We’ve received a lot of tips,” said Riviello, who credits this influx to the new application’s user friendly design.
“People don’t pick up and call about mundane things,” he said.
The CPD hopes the app will foster “accessibility and communication” between the department and the public, according to a press release.
“Residents and businesses can now access important information and communicate with Cambridge Police from the palm of their hand as we continue to share more information and increase interaction between the community and the police,” Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas said in the statement.
The app, designed by Peabody Police Department Detective Peter Olson, comes at little cost to the CPD.
“We pay less than $1,000 a year to be a part of this service,” said Riviello, adding that it would take $20-30,000 for the CPD to create its own program.
Riviello said that while the CPD hopes that the application will be used throughout Cambridge, the Police Department is most concerned with users’ experience.
“If the app brings the people value, and it brings us value, then it is worth it,” Riviello said.

Old dining hall standbys like pizza and macaroni and cheese have some new companions this season, ranging from Southern grits and collard greens to Thai curry to Korean bibimbap.
Harvard University Dining Services unveiled its new winter menu items starting last week in all 13 undergraduate dining halls.
The new menu includes more seafood and vegetarian entrees, new bean and grain salads, the beef consommé and Welsh rarebit served at the 375th anniversary celebration dinner in October, and frozen yogurt options which will give HUDS’ chilled desserts “a flavor profile more like Berryline,” according to an email from Crista Martin, the director for marketing and communications for HUDS.
Martin wrote that HUDS drew on data from the student survey that it conducted in December to choose the new menu items.
Special daily options also change seasonally. This winter, HUDS plans to offer a make-your-own Peking chicken and tofu bar on Monday evenings, a fruit bar on Tuesdays, and the popular Korean beef barbecue served last year every Wednesday.
“We’re also continuing our efforts to make the deli bar healthier by roasting some of our own meats,” Martin wrote.
“I think this semester’s menu so far has been more appetizing than last semester’s,” Andrew D. Talbot ’15 said.
Elaine Cheng ’15 noticed increased diversity in the new dishes.
“The students have come from a wide background, and I think it’s kind and nice that they’re trying to cater to us,” Cheng said.
Parker B. Davis ’15 said after a week of eating the new foods that the dining halls are “really stepping it up this semester.”
But some were more skeptical of HUDS’ effort to vary its selection.
“I rarely eat at Annenberg because the food is neither very tasty nor healthy,” Justin S. Katiraei ’15 said. “The new food items may be a welcome change, but only time will tell.”
The new foods will stay on the menu until spring break, when they will be replaced with new spring menu items.

Although world peace may be a utopian ideal, those living in fear of World War III have reason to exhale, psychology professor Steven A. Pinker and American University professor Joshua S. Goldstein asserted Monday night at a Harvard Kennedy School forum.
Speaking to a packed audience, Goldstein and Pinker explained the central arguments of their recently released books on dramatic declines in violence in the modern world. The forum, moderated by former Dean of the Kennedy School Joseph S. Nye Jr., pitted Goldstein and Pinker against Monica D. Toft and Stephen M. Walt, professors at the Kennedy School.
“I don’t see the endpoint here being world peace, harmony and understanding, or the Age of Aquarius. I see war becoming rare, small, and socially frowned on. I think we could have half as many wars as we had last decade in the coming decade, and half that again in the next,” said Goldstein, echoing the thesis of his book “Winning the War on War.”
Goldstein and Pinker based their arguments for the decreasing prevalence of armed interstate conflict largely on data collected over the past 60 years since the end of World War II. They cited the United Nations and humanitarianism as significant causes of this trend.
Goldstein in particular called for increased UN funding, stating that “the United Nations has accomplished a huge amount, always with too little money....The average American family pays about $700 a year to support the army compared to just $2 for the UN.”
A major theme in the forum was the role that cross-cultural interaction plays in increasing empathy. “Once you have the ground rules for diplomacy in place, people start to realize the stupidity of violence,” said Pinker. “The development of a stronger international community...has discouraged the notion that the unilateral pacifist is a sitting duck.”
Toft and Walt raised a number of concerns about the theories presented in both books and questioned the central contention that today’s world is significantly less prone to violence. Walt described a phenomenon he termed the “democratization of violence,” by which smaller groups of people can do more harm than ever before in history.
“9/11 was caused by 19 people on a budget of about $500,000,” said Walt, adding that Goldstein’s and Pinker’s books were “not a very reassuring recipe for complacency.”
Goldstein defended his work by stressing the dangers of excess optimism and stated that, despite the relative peace of the past 60 years, a new catastrophic war is still a possibility. Both Goldstein and Pinker emphasized the positive long-term trends presented in their books and acknowledged the dangers that persist.
“We’re not contrarians—we’re scientists,” said Goldstein. “We’ve taken all this evidence and discovered that the world is not going to hell in a hand basket, but it’s hard to convince people of that when you can turn on the news and see violence.”

Students flocked to economics-related courses this spring, with Economics 10 defending the title it held in the fall as the largest course of the semester and spring’s Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics” coming in second place.
Economics 10, the historically popular course headed by N. Gregory Mankiw, began its second semester with 638 undergraduates, slightly more than a 50-person decrease from last spring. As usual, the second semester of the yearlong course saw a moderate decrease from its fall enrollment of 719 undergraduates.
Statistics 104 saw a marked increase in students since last spring. With 554 undergraduates currently enrolled, the class boasts more than 200 more students than it did last year.
Computer Science 51, the sequel course to the popular introductory class Computer Science 50, also displayed a substantial increase, from 164 undergraduates last spring to 217 this semester.
Some professors of these popular offerings credited the practicality of their subject matter with attracting students.
“I am delighted that Ec 10 is the largest course once again,” Mankiw wrote in an email. “Understanding the basics of how an economy functions is a key element of good citizenship, and it is good to see so many students appreciating that fact.”
John G. Morrisett, who teaches Computer Science 51, said that “the vast majority” of his students—who number about a third of the enrollees in the fall prerequisite Computer Science 50—had no intention of concentrating in computer science before taking the first course in the sequence. After a semester, though, Morrisett said they came to see value in furthering their studies in the field.
“Many students seem to see a concentration, or at least a minor, in computer science as a good idea,” Morrisett wrote in an email. “These days, students recognize that it’s important to have some computational thinking in their intellectual bag of tools, regardless of what they hope to do later in life.”
The most dramatic increase of the semester was seen in Science of the Physical Universe 30: “Life as a Planetary Phenomenon.” Enrollment shot up 285 percent, from 92 undergraduates last spring to 354.
According to Dimitar D. Sasselov, who teaches the course, it was mistakenly listed as unavailable in the online course catalogue last spring, which dissuaded students from shopping it. Though Sasselov said he anticipated an increase once his class had a proper listing, this year’s high exceeded his expectations.
Many professors said the student rankings in the online Q guide swayed shoppers’ choices this year.
Population ethics professor Daniel Wikler guessed that the Q guide ratings for his class Ethical Reasoning 24: “Bioethics” were a major factor behind the course’s drop from 127 undergraduates to 18. The overall Q guide score for Ethical Reasoning 24 is 2.88 out of 5.

Though the Cambridge City Council was once again unable to select a new mayor—an issue which has remained unresolved since Jan. 2—the Council moved to aid a local dance center soon to be displaced.
At the meeting’s opening, Councillor Leland Cheung, a Harvard Kennedy School student, called for the Council to vote for the next mayor. But members decided to wait for the tardy councillor, Timothy J. Toomey Jr.
In the first round, votes split as they had in the past two meetings, with Cheung and Councillor Marjorie C. Decker each receiving three votes.
Cheung maintained three votes through the next two rounds of voting. But Decker lost a vote in the process, ending the night with only two votes. Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, who received no votes at the beginning of the meeting, gained two votes by the end of the process.
Councillors must earn at least five out of nine votes to be elected mayor.
After the unsuccessful voting, councillors turned to the forced relocation of a non-profit dance school.
Councillors heard the impassioned testimony of Deborah Mason, who runs the Deborah Mason School of Dance.
“I have never asked for anything from this city,” said Mason, trying to hold back tears. “But I am now. These kids deserve a home. Something better than what we’re in now.”
The school—which also functions as a community center—is located in a dilapidated building in North Cambridge. Mason’s building and the buildings around it are slated to be torn down to make way for a condominium complex, Mason said. Mason appealed to the Council, hoping that the city might help her find a permanent location for the studio.
Dozens of concerned students, teachers, and parents came to the Council meeting to express their support for Mason’s dance school.
One student, a young boy, was too short to reach the microphone.  A red-headed teenager picked him up for his testimony and held him there, grimacing playfully, until he finished.
“At DMSD, we are a family,” middle schooler Julia R. Bluestein-Goldfinger said. “Even though the building is literally crumbling, we’re still there. And even though we slip on the rain that’s dripping through the ceiling, we’re still there.”
This is not the first time Mason’s school has been displaced—Cottage Park Ave. is the school’s fifth location.  “I’ve had to move because landlords want more rent, or other people buy the buildings and don’t think a dance studio belongs there,” said Mason, a lifelong Cambridge resident who founded the studio in 1975.
“It’s not like years ago, when local people owned the buildings and would help local people,” she added. “It’s now developers who are buying up the property and renting it for high costs that people like me can’t afford.”
Councillors resolved to forward Mason’s petition to the city manager, who will help put the studio in touch with property owners.
“You do have a lot of support here,” Decker assured Mason and her supporters. “You are going to be on the radar.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his first visit to Harvard since the University’s official recognition of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps in March, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus spoke about the Navy’s commitment to alternative energy at Harvard Business School on Monday evening.
At the event sponsored by the Harvard Business School Association of Boston, Mabus presented plans to decrease the Navy’s dependence on foreign oil, which he said has made its operations susceptible to fluctuations in global prices.
“When you run a military organization...you look for vulnerabilities,” Mabus said. “Our energy dependence jump[s] out as one of the biggest vulnerabilities we have today.”
Mabus, who has held office since 2009, has pledged for 50 percent of all Department of Navy energy to come from alternative sources by 2020. President Barack Obama praised these efforts in last Tuesday’s State of the Union address.
In particular, Mabus focused on the transition to biofuels in Navy and Marine Corps vessels and aircraft. When an audience member questioned the increase in operation costs that would result from using green energy, Mabus said that the price of biofuels has already dropped dramatically in recent years.
Beyond the environmental implications, Mabus said that Naval commitment to U.S.-grown biofuels could help spur American competitiveness in the burgeoning industry. He cited the Navy’s purchase of U.S. steel in the early 1900s as a crucial step towards creating a robust steel industry. The Navy can have a similar effect on green energy by increasing demand, he said.
Mabus also commented on the significance of Harvard’s decision to bring back Naval ROTC. The military withdrew from campus in 1969 amidst student and faculty protests against the Vietnam War. In the last few years, the University maintained chilly relations with the military, calling “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” a violation of its non-discrimination policy. In December 2010, Congress repealed DADT, which banned gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military.
Mabus praised the agreement he signed last March with University President Drew G. Faust that renewed the Navy’s relationship with Harvard.
“It’s very appropriate that Naval ROTC is back at Harvard,” Mabus said. “It’s an oversight that I’m glad has been corrected.”
Mabus also highlighted Harvard’s leadership on the issue, mentioning similar steps to bring back ROTC at Yale and Columbia in the days after his meeting with Faust.
At the beginning of the event, Mabus recognized audience member Admiral Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., a retired U.S. Navy aviator and Medal of Honor recipient for his service during the Korean War.
“I thought it was a great presentation,” Hudner said. “Even for a sophisticated group like this, it was very edifying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in front of a sold out Bright Hockey Center crowd and a far larger national television audience Friday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team needed somebody to finally step up.
Facing Ivy rival Yale, the team was badly in need of a win, having not gotten one since Dec. 10.
So it turned to its best scorer and assistant captain.
And Alex Killorn rose to the challenge.
The senior scored his second goal of the night with 1:19 left in the game, giving the Crimson a dramatic 4-3 victory.
“All year, we’ve been trying to put a full game together, and [Friday night] it seemed like everything just came together,” Killorn said. “That last goal at the end was exciting [after] being in so many close games throughout the year, so we were pretty happy with that.”
The following evening, in front of another sellout home crowd, Killorn did it again.
This time, the forward scored a bit earlier—with eight minutes remaining in the final period—but the goal nonetheless proved to be a game-winner in Harvard’s 3-1 victory.
“We said we had to find a way to win that type of game,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Fortunately we had some guys step up and make some big plays.”
The two late tiebreaking goals were especially important for a Harvard team that had gone to overtime in eight of its previous 11 contests and had already set a program record with eight draws on the year.
“You know what’s on the line when it’s a tie game,” Killorn said. “And I think you dial in a little bit more, knowing that if you score the next goal, especially with the time remaining, it could be a game-winner.”
That was just what Killorn did this weekend when his flair for the dramatic helped a resurgent Crimson squad reach fourth place in the ECAC standings, a position within striking distance of the teams directly above it.
And the senior’s tallies were not just timely; they were also impressive.
In his game-winner against Yale—just three minutes after the Bulldogs had tied the game themselves—Killorn took a long cross-ice pass from junior forward Marshall Everson and got loose on a breakaway. His first shot was blocked by Yale goalie Jeff Malcolm, but Killorn followed through with his backhand and put back his own rebound in traffic, finishing with an ebullient fist pump before he was mobbed by his teammates.
“Earlier in the period, I had like the exact same play, a two-on-one,” Killorn said. “I ended up shooting it high, and I didn’t want to do that again.... There was a lot going on. I got the shot off and it just ended up going through his legs.”
“[It was a] big goal,” Donato added. “We needed to find a way to put us over the top in a game.”
The score came a period after Killorn tied the game at 2-2. Fifty-five seconds into the second, the forward took a pass from junior defenseman Danny Biega, flew up the left side of the rink from the blue line, skated around the net, and beat Malcolm inside the right post for a forehanded wraparound score.
One day later, Killorn was back at it against the Bears.
In four-on-four play, the senior moved into the slot and fired the puck off the left post past Brown goaltender Mike Clemente to put the Crimson up, 2-1, 12:18 into the final period.
“I was trailing [senior forward Eric] Kroshus,” Killorn said. “He dropped it back to me, I kind of did a fake shot, went around the D, and luckily I took a shot and it hit the post and went in.”
The three goals on the weekend gave Killorn a team-high 14 on the season, tied for third best in the ECAC. The Tampa Bay Lightning draftee also leads the squad with 26 points—fourth in the conference—and is second with 12 assists.
“Alex has been a good player for us for the past three years, but this year he’s turned it up to a whole new level,” senior forward Daniel Moriarty said. “He’s one of the best players in the league, if not in the country.... We hope he’s going to continue to score down the stretch for us.”
For his part, Killorn is just planning on doing whatever he can to help the team maintain its newfound winning touch.
“It’s frustrating to be in so many tight games,” Killorn said. “But we also look at it optimistically, in the sense that a lot of those ties have been on the road. [Now] we’ve got a stretch at home where I feel like we could turn some of those ties into wins.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the eve of its semifinal matchup against Boston University in the 34th annual women’s Beanpot, the No. 8 Harvard women’s hockey team (14-6-1, 11-4-1 ECAC) had one thing on its mind: a chance at retribution.
“It’s all about pride,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey said. “We lost last year in the [Beanpot] finals, and my freshman year we won. We want to get the taste of the Beanpot back again. We have a unique opportunity to play in such a special little tournament.”
The tournament—which pits the Crimson, BU, Northeastern, and Boston College against each other in a two-round battle for Boston-area dominance—kicks off Tuesday night at the Terriers’ Walter Brown Arena.
The Huskies and the Eagles are up first, while the Crimson and BU (14-12-1, 9-7 Hockey East) close out the doubleheader in Boston.
“As a team, we know that we have a really good shot at winning the Beanpot,” sophomore forward Kalley Armstrong continued. “We all know we can, it’s just about us accepting that and just going out and getting it.”
Harvard started off last year’s Beanpot in dramatic fashion, earning a shootout victory over Northeastern in double overtime.
But the Crimson had a bit of a letdown in the finals, dropping its contest against the Eagles, 3-1.
Boston College asserted itself as the top Boston-area school on both the men’s and women’s side last year, taking home both Beanpot titles on consecutive nights.
Although the memory of last year’s loss in the finals is still fresh, Harvard’s current focus is on its first-round matchup on Tuesday night.
“We’re playing to get to next Tuesday,” Armstrong said. “We’re just thinking about winning [this Tuesday night] first, and then we’ll take the next Tuesday as it comes.”
To get an opportunity to play for its 14th Beanpot title in school history, Harvard will have to go through a strong Terrier squad that has bounced in and out of the national rankings this season.
“We’re up against a tough opponent,” Dempsey said. “There were a lot of strong points we can take away from this weekend. But we need to tighten up and strengthen everything because BU will definitely capitalize on our mistakes.”
The Terriers are currently on a three-game winning streak and have been ranked as high as No. 2/3 in national polls.
“BU is a really good team,” captain Alisa Baumgartner said. “They dropped out of the [national] polls two weeks ago, which is kind of shocking because they’re a really good team. That’s something that we can’t overlook going into this game. They have a lot of really skilled players, and I think it will be a really good game.”
But despite the magnitude of the matchup, Harvard has no plans to drastically adjust its style of play against BU.
“We’ve talked all season about not worrying what the other team is doing,” Baumgartner said. “BU is a great team, but…we need to execute the things we know how to do and beat them with our game plan instead of trying to tailor it to what they’ve prepared for us.”
The Crimson enters Tuesday night’s game on the tail of an impressive weekend of ECAC play.
Harvard outscored its opponents, 15-0, in its last three games, claiming shutout victories over ECAC foes Colgate, Brown, and Yale.
“[The wins this weekend] give us momentum and confidence,” Dempsey said. “We’re excited and feel pretty confident going into Tuesday.”
And the possibility of garnering Boston-area bragging rights isn’t the only reason the Crimson places a lot of importance on this particular set of games.
“Every game is taken just as intensely, but the Beanpot is pretty special for us because it’s the four Boston schools,” junior forward Kaitlin Spurling said. “We’re super excited for that and taking it day by day. We want to put ourselves in the best position possible so that we can make the [ECAC] tournament at the end of the season.”
ECAC playoffs kick off in a few weeks, and Harvard—currently ranked second in the conference—looks to contend for the title.
“I like the Beanpot because it’s a couple weeks before our playoffs,” Baumgartner said. “These are the games you want to play in because it gets that energy and anticipation up. You know that if you don’t win the game, you’re going home. It’s perfect timing for the Beanpot because it really forces you to dig deep and say that we need to win this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago this week, junior Laura Gemmell was on top of the collegiate squash world.
Gemmell was Harvard’s undefeated No. 1 player and a reigning individual national champion who had just led her team to a national title. She was in the middle of another undefeated season as a sophomore, fighting for another pair of trophies. With 21 national championships to her name in her native Canada, Gemmell was the Harvard women’s squash version of Dwayne Wade. Enter LeBron.
This year Harvard has a new No. 1: Amanda Sobhy, 2010 Junior World Champion.  The only American to ever win the title at the junior worlds, the freshman currently sits at No. 24 in the Women’s International Squash Player’s Association rankings, the governing body of professional women’s squash.
Sunday, Sobhy upset the World’s No. 6 women’s squash player, Australian Rachael Grinham, at the Cleveland Classic. Monday she did one better, topping World No. 2 Jenny Duncalf after Duncalf retired due to injury. The college freshman, who was playing as an amateur to ensure college eligibility, was up 2-1 at the time of Duncalf’s retirement, according to sources close to Sobhy.
Together, Sobhy and Gemmell form arguably the most powerful 1-2 punch in the history of college squash.
“Amanda unquestionably is the best No. 1 [in collegiate women’s squash history],” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “I suppose if you take the fact that [Gemmel] went two years unbeaten, that’s got to be the best 1-2 punch. I’ll go out there and say it.”
And the results so far this season are indicative of that kind of supremacy. In her three collegiate matches, Sobhy has taken on the No. 3, No. 4, and No. 12 players from last year. So far, Harvard’s freshman sensation hasn’t dropped a game. What’s more, no one has scored more than seven points against her in any game, leading to a 99-28 combined score.
Sobhy has leveled the best players the competition has had to offer, but Gemmell expected this kind of dominance when Sobhy committed to the Crimson last spring.
“Everyone was really excited to have someone of her caliber playing for our team and in college squash in general,” Gemmell said. “She’s definitely the best college squash player of all time.”
Because of her participation in professional tournaments, Sobhy was required by the Ivy League to sit out for the first 30 percent of Harvard’s matches. Sobhy concedes that the college game, while competitive, operates at a lower level than some of her previous competitions.
“I’m used to extremely tough matches with players at the pro level who do that for a living,” said the Sea Cliff, N.Y. native. “[On the professional circuit], I’m playing against women ten years older than me or twice my age…. It’s nice to be in college squash where the people are my own age and the level is not as intense.”
And while Sobhy continues her perfect season, Gemmell has also dismantled the competition.
Playing at the No. 2 position, Gemmell has gone a perfect 3-0, dropping only one game to Penn’s All-American, Rachel Goh. And after Sobhy’s eligibility concerns and early season illness, Gemmell is excited to take the court with the freshman.
“I was really excited to play with her,” the Eliot House resident said. “To be able to compete with her and train with her now all the time [is great.]”
But Sobhy has a modified training regimen. Before coming to Harvard, the program agreed to let Sobhy train with the men’s team as much as she wanted to help keep her challenged.
Way sees the mixed training as a necessity for any top player’s development.
“Laura played with the men a lot last year,” Way said. “But [Sobhy], at that level, has to spend even more time with the men.  She does at least three sessions out of five with the men, sometimes four. And sometimes she does a double [session].”
But for Sobhy, someone who has competed as an individual for most of her life, the team aspect of collegiate squash is one of its main appeals.
“It’s really great having a team,” Sobhy said. “We all push each other.  Whenever we are down we have the team to pick each other up, and we’re always there to help each other if we have problems.  It’s nice to have a big support group; it’s like a big family.”
The rest of the team also seems supportive of Sobhy’s training routine, as Gemmell believes anything that helps her teammate helps the team as a whole.
“Women’s squash is very different than men’s squash. I get much more out of playing the top women’s player than when I used to train with some of the guys in my previous years,” Gemmell said. “The pace she hits the ball at, and the way she moves around the court, it’s at such a high level. I feel like I improve so much playing with her.”
Gemmell, despite her strong performances in the No. 2 spot, has found this season to be quite unlike her previous ones.
“My sophomore year was basically a repeat of my freshman year because you play the same girls at the No. 1 spot each time,” Gemmell said. “Obviously, I would love to play the No. 1 girls, but I still have super competitive matches.”
With Sobhy and Gemmell, the Crimson look poised to continue their undefeated season and make a run at returning to the summit of women’s collegiate squash.
“I think the team feels really confident,” Gemmell said. “The end of January and beginning of February is the heart of our season, and we have been training all fall for it, so people are really excited and confident.  If you look at our whole line-up, we are just stacked.”

Shit Girls Say: the YouTube video that launched a thousand YouTube videos. Then followed Shit Black Girls Say, Shit Girls Say to Gay Guys, Shit Hipsters Say, and various others. Well get ready…another spin-off dedicated to over-used phrases is in the works: "Shit Harvard Students Say."
A "Shit Harvard Students Say" tumblr was launched today, featuring only-at-Harvard phrases like "He's hot but lives in the Quad. So not worth it" and "I took CS50."
In the meantime, two freshmen are currently producing videos on the same theme.
"I saw the original video and the subsequent spin offs. Being a pompous Harvard student, I thought I should make one about Harvard students," Aaron H. Aceves '15 said. He has already filmed, and is currently editing footage.
Meanwhile, C.C. Gong '15, a Crimson photo editor, is compiling inspiration for a script via a public Google Doc that she hopes will supply most of the substance of her own video. "I wanted a lot of Harvard kids to be involved and contribute," Gong said. She is eager to have as many students appear in the video as possible and says filming will begin within the week.
Looks like Harvard students have a lot of shit to say.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: January 31, 2012.
An earlier version of the Jan. 31 post "Shit Harvard Students Say" misidentified C.C. Gong '15 as a Crimson news editor. In fact, she is a Crimson photo editor.

"Starting a discussion about love and sex at Harvard can be like doing a female condom demonstration—a little awkward, hard to insert, sometimes squeaky, but ultimately rewarding," said Samantha A. Meier '12 during a meeting to discuss the first ever Sex Week at Harvard, which will take place from March 25 to 31.
While Harvard hosts an annual Female Orgasm Seminar, it has never had a sex week, which is popular at colleges like Yale, Brown, and Northwestern. Meier and Abby P. Sun '13 saw a need to fill this hole, and thus founded Sexual Health Education & Advocacy throughout Harvard College (SHEATH).
Over the course of the week, there will be speakers, activities, prizes, and free food. "We are really conscious of the fact there are a lot of different perspectives on campus. We want to make sure that our programming reflects the diversity of students," Sun said.
Some of the panels include Dirty Talk, The Stigma of Anal Sex, and Asexuality. "We are pretty excited about everything, and we hope that this will be a really great beginning to a long line of educational events," Sun said.
Mark your calendars.

Carrie J. Tian '15, Harvard's very own, competed in Jeopardy!'s College Championship on Jan. 5. The annual tournament will air its first episode Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on CBS.
Tian, a freshman from South Carolina and a Crimson Magazine writer, is the first contestant to represent Harvard at this tournament since 2009. Her journey to the show began last March when she took a 50-item online test along with 12,000 other Jeopardy!-hopefuls. Of these students, only 300 were called back for a "screen test."
Tian never thought she would make it. "They had 12,000 applicants and could only pick 15 kids, so the odds weren't very good," Tian said.
But months later, Tian received a call from an unknown number.
"I don't get calls from Culver City, California," she said. "Next thing I know, a lady was asking me whether I had any relatives at Sony or if I had ever committed a felony."
It was only after the contest coordinator from Jeopardy! said, "Congratulations and we'll see you at your college tournament!" that Tian realized she had been chosen.
At 17 years old, Tian was the youngest contestant in the tournament this year. Some of her competitors included students from Columbia University, Duke University, and Indiana University.
"We were all wearing our hoodies and everyone was sizing each other up," she said.
Tian, who refers to show host Alex Trebek simply as "Alex," said that she "freaked out" whenever she caught a glimpse of white hair around the studio. Minutes before the show, she finally spotted Trebek and waved to him. To her delight, he waved back.
"Walking onto the set of Jeopardy! was like walking through Harvard for the first time," Tian said. "You've seen it so many times in pictures and in videos, but those don't do it justice."
Although Tian is not allowed to reveal anything that occurred during the filming of the show, she said that it felt good to show the world that Harvard students know their stuff. The episode featuring her intellectual battle with two other contestants will be viewed by nine to ten million people.
Tian gave no hints as to how far she got in the tournament. In the promo advertisement of the show, however, she is shown saying the words "100,000 dollars!"—the grand prize for winning the tournament.
When asked if this was a clue, Tian smiled but gave nothing away.
"Watch the show to find out," she said.
