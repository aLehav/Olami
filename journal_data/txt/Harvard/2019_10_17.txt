After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lips tremble, voices quake, and tears escape. Shaking hands clasp rosaries and children clutch toys. Everything is precious, yet it could all be gone in a moment, and millions of adults and children alike live with that uncertainty every day.
The Netflix documentary series “Living Undocumented” profiles the lives of eight families living in the United States without citizenship. Some live entirely under ICE’s radar, in constant fear that a routine police stop will lead to their discovery and cause their carefully constructed world to crumble. Others are forced to endure regular check-ins, terrified each time they enter an ICE facility that they may never leave. Some of those profiled entered the United States illegally, while others came on a valid visa but never left. Although their stories vary widely, all seek a better life for themselves and their families within this nation’s borders.
Luis Diaz-Inestroza came to America from Honduras in 2012. His pregnant partner Kenia Bautista-Mayorga is about to be deported and Luis is bringing her three-year-old son, Noah, to the detention center, where he will be sent back to Honduras with his mother. Luis puts himself at risk simply by delivering Noah, but a careful plan is arranged. Their lawyer, the indomitable Andrea Martinez, and another attorney will drive Luis and Noah to an established meeting point in the parking lot where another van will deliver Kenia, allowing them a final embrace. By the time the sickening realization sets in that Kenia will not be allowed to leave the building, a gruff agent has grabbed Luis and dragged him and the sleepy toddler inside. As the lawyers attempt to follow, one is shoved to the ground, fracturing a foot and bloodying a knee. The viewer is left to wonder, as Martinez herself does, if that is how they treat attorneys with an audience of protestors and a horde of video cameras, “imagine how ICE is treating immigrants behind closed doors when nobody is watching.”
Ron’s story is markedly different. His last name is not used as he is not in ICE’s system, and he desperately needs to keep it that way. He came to America 17 years ago with his wife and infant daughter, Bar. They fled Israel when their home became a war zone. Unable to return, Ron describes watching his father’s funeral on a DVD sent to him by a cousin. Bar, now 17, relies on her DACA status to survive. She is grateful to be here and yet her voice breaks as she explains, “This is my life. And I always have to do everything scared.” Ron is America’s dream immigrant. Despite his undocumented status, he is the co-owner of a business that makes $2 million a year and dutifully pays his taxes. Rather than “stealing jobs,” Ron has created them for dozens of people in his community.
Not all those profiled in “Living Undocumented” can be easily painted as “model citizens.” Vinny fled Laos in the 1980’s and was given permanent resident status, something most immigrants today can only dream of. But Vinny lost his permanent residency due to time spent in prison for dealing methamphetamine. While Vinny found religion, rehabilitated himself, and is now married with a young daughter, his story is difficult to watch after some of the others. While his story is deeply inspiring, it is hard to argue for a second chance when many never receive a first: an insoluble dilemma.
All of the families featured together create a remarkably nuanced, comprehensive presentation of who undocumented immigrants or, as many on the far-right refer to them, “illegal aliens,” truly are. Cinematically, by switching between each family, seeing fragments of each story at a time, viewers get some semblance of how much of the immigration process is a waiting game and how these stories intersect. One is able to compare the different families and the struggles each faces. New families appear and old ones slowly aren’t followed anymore, as conclusive answers and neat endings are often impossible when discussing immigration. Safety for some, like Vinny, simply means getting through another check point, buying just another year. They have to be satisfied with these brief increments because permanency is not an option, a difficult and unstable way to live.
Throughout “Living Undocumented,” heroes emerge. Thousands of immigration attorneys dedicate endless time and energy to wage against what is often a frustrating, futile, and painful battle. They must often put themselves at great personal risk in order to fight passionately for their clients, motivated only by the desire to help people who desperately need it. In a way, the filmmakers, production team, and others involved in creating this docuseries are doing a similar job. They are taking people who have been silenced by an oppressive, bureaucratic system and handing them a megaphone. The documentary format is well-used, with legal experts and lawyers appearing only to describe changes in immigration policy between presidential administrations and other complex details. For the most part, the families tell their own stories. The audience is able to form a personal connection with those on screen.
Interestingly, the production and the team behind this series has been talked about more widely than for typical shows. This is because the show’s Executive Producer is actress and singer, Selena Gomez. While this may have concerned some, given Gomez’s history producing “13 Reasons Why,” a series frequently criticized for its questionable portrayal of mental health issues and suicide, Gomez is taking a risk herself in championing this cause. She wrote in Time Magazine, “As a Mexican-American woman, I feel a responsibility to use my platform to be a voice for people who are too afraid to speak,” and a recently uploaded YouTube video shows the star in a sort of round table discussion with three children whose stories are included in the series: Bar, Camilo, and Pablo. She concludes the video with the message, “Immigration is a complex issue, and while I don’t have answers on how to fix it, it needs to be talked about. Bar, Camilo and Pablo were brought to the United States when they were children. They grew up here, built their lives here, and they know no other home than this country. No one should be subjected to the condition that their families have had to endure.”
It is commendable that she is lending her considerable platform — she currently has just shy of 160 million Instagram followers, for example — to illuminate such a crucial issue. Furthermore, it is unspeakably brave of the families to allow their names and faces to be broadcast globally to Netflix’s millions of subscribers. They have taken an unfathomable risk to tell their stories, and with that, the stories of so many others who must remain in the shadows.
U.S. immigration policy has been incessantly debated on television, online, in offices and around dinner tables across the country. This subject is incredibly divisive and the debates often become heated. However, during these arguments, immigration reform is often discussed in the abstract, relying on general statistics, vague facts, and hypothetical examples of sympathetic stories and dangerous repercussions alike. What makes “Living Undocumented” uniquely compelling is that it is fundamentally human. And it is this humanity that makes it so gut-wrenching: Luis’s courageous decision to brave an ICE facility to say goodbye to Kenia; Bar working harder than any young person should have to yet living in constant fear. Their stories of strength and triumph should be celebrated. They embody passion and determination and grit. And you know what? They are American.

Even for an event as hotly anticipated as the Immediate Gratification Players’s (IGP) Player of the Year event, starring Rachel Bloom, the SOCH penthouse is a pretty bleak environment to host a comedy event. Thankfully, not even dire, conference-style seating, and smatterings of rain could ruin a good show. The energy of IGP Players, a willing audience, and Rachel Bloom’s down-to-earth banter made the night buoyant and playful, just as improv should be.
Bloom, famous for her hit rom-com musical TV show “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” is perhaps less known for her work in improvisational comedy, despite having worked with the famous Upright Citizens Brigade Improv Theatre while at NYU. The show, then, was a rare opportunity to experience Bloom’s award-winning comedic imagination in an intimate, free-flowing setting. Whilst solo bits from Bloom — largely focussed around self-deprecating insights into Bloom’s life — did not disappoint, she seemed to truly come into her own during skits with the IGP players. A particular highlight was watching the easy repartee between Bloom and Elise B. Chenevey ’22, where, in a feminist theory class led by Bloom, Chenevey played the role of an irreverently Gen-Z student who, in lieu of a paper, had submitted a 120,000 word Aladdin fan-fiction, starring herself as Jasmine.
It is in moments like these that IGP really showed their comedy chops, even when sharing the stage with a celebrated artist such a Bloom. Indeed one of the greatest strengths of the show was that it felt in no way like a comedy masterclass — Bloom had an easy rapport with the Players, at some points even leading the entire group in a raucous Jewish tap dance session, but also stepping back to allow the players to take the limelight.
Some of the biggest laughs of the night came from the Players — Elliot J. Schiff ’21 demonstrated an effective command of comedic timing, including a clever bit as “Cool God,” who unexpectedly responds to the prayer of a fervent believer (Frank L. Garland ’20) with “this has never happened before!” Meanwhile, Chenevey and Hope S. Green ’20 expertly and wittily navigated the uncanny world of dating and beauty pageants for a woman with two mouths, in an unexpected tale of plastic surgery gone seriously wrong.
IGP’s strongest material were in skits like these which parodied contemporary life — while there was an ecstatic joy to surrealist escapes into a world where the genie from Aladdin “goes by ‘Gene’ now” and dragons were taking over Albuquerque, the hardest-hitting moments in the show came in the form of delirious one-liners, a format that current IGP Czar Frank Garland (“The Closer,” if you will) certainly has a knack for, repeatedly ending skits on a high.
By nature improv is, of course, a precarious art, and at times in search for structural cohesion, certain themes were perhaps overwrought — repeated references to “Chicago: The Musical,” for example, began to lose their impact in the last couple repetitions, and, while a skit where Chenevey gave birth to an entire live improv troupe was fascinating to see executed, it lacked a certain nuance which could have elevated it past novelty.
That said, while there were moments of nuance, ingenuity, and perhaps even poignancy in the show, these factors weren’t the driving force behind the exuberant madness which was the IGP Player of the Year Show. A combination of the seemingly limitless energy and charisma of the Players, a good-humoured Bloom, and an undeniably sporting audience meant that the show was a silly and joyous celebration of simply a group of funny people, letting their imaginations run riot, and not taking anything too seriously. Or in other words, on a rainy October evening, it was exactly what was needed.

This weekend, Latinx artists kicked off Yo Soy LOLA’s 2019 LOLA Week with an intimate, multidimensional performance, “Las Que Señan,” at a sold-out American Repertory Theater in Cambridge.
Yo Soy LOLA (Latinas Orgullosas de Las Artes), a project of the Social Good Fund, seeks to embolden current Latinx artists to pursue an education in the arts. Every year, the team uses the gala and other events to raise money for three $3,000 scholarships awarded to young Latinx artists in the Boston area.
This Friday alone, “Las Que Señan” raised $3,300 in donations towards the 2019 goal. That was particularly exciting as this is just the start of LOLA week. Fundraising will continue throughout the remaining two events — in addition to an earlier spoken word evening entitled “Untamed Tongues” this past Sunday; “Rising,” a panel discussion Wednesday, Oct. 16 at 4 p.m. at Lesley University; and “DURA,” a visual and performing arts gallery Saturday, Oct. 19 at 6 p.m. at The Arlington Street Church. While LOLA’s mission is focused on the Latinx community, Ana Masacote, a member of the leadership committee since its inception, spoke on Lola’s mission.
“Lola shares really important messages to the community. And not just to the Latinx community, because LOLA belongs to everybody,” Masacote said. This sentiment manifested itself in this weekend’s gala. The show consisted of two acts: The first was an all female one act play about an immigrant family moving to the United States, and the second was a compilation of spoken word, instrumental, flamenco, and drag performances. No one artist was confined by the stage; instead, the performance flowed into and around the crowd giving an inviting, interactive experience.
“Act one is about the Afro-Latinx family just living their dreams trying to figure it out,” Tatiana Gil, the playwright, said. Gil has been a part of the LOLA movement since its inception, first as a committee member, theatrical consultant, and playwright, but now solely as a playwright. Her first one act play was a response look at the Orlando massacre. This year, the committee gave Gil a prompt to go with the overall theme of Resilience throughout LOLA week.
“The prompt was about the masks that we wear. And so what I pulled out of that was assimilation.” Gil said. “I think I was given a prompt about how do we navigate the world as Latinx folks as Latinx identifying folks, and what’s the shit we have to move through in order to achieve our dreams?’ And I extrapolated that, I made it about dreams.”
Walter Kikuchi, who works for the partner abuse survivor non-profit La Red, appreciated Gil’s work. “I thought really brilliant. Extremely moving,” he said. “It was amazing to see an immigrant story as well as the children of immigrants and the way that they promote change in their communities.”
But the show didn’t stop there. After a dance-break intermission with the full cast of the first act, a powerful exhibition of five other artists closed out the night. Phree, a spoken word artist featured multiple times in the second act, Lauded LOLA for putting on the show.
“The movement is very powerful in being able to give platforms to Latinx bodies — and Latinx bodies to be inclusive to all bodies, and not just gender conforming identities,” Phree said. With poetry about generational trauma, identity, and resiliency within that, they resonated well with other members of the cast and audience. “It truly is a family here; the family is beautiful,” they said.
Committee members Carla M. Sanchez and Amanda Bravo, who were instrumental in founding Yo Soy LOLA, gave praise for the gala and progression of Yo Soy LOLA’s mission.
“It has grown from in every aspect: in the amount of scholarships we raise, in the amount of people we have involved in the production, in the amount of events we have...This year we were able to pay people on a stipend base because of our grant from the ‘Boston Foundation’ grant,” Bravo said.
Sanchez was also excited about the growth of LOLA over its three years, particularly in its fulfillment of uplifting Latina artists.
“I also see our team and the people who are performing at our events get a platform elsewhere. We are seeing people get booked for more shows. We are seeing people actually start getting jobs in the industry instead of having that 9 to 5 somewhere that they don’t want to.”
Gil had even broader ambitions, saying she envisioned Yo Soy LOLA to expand cross-country and affect the lives of Latinxs throughout the United States.
Following the show, DJ La Nena invited everyone to be a part of the family via a dance party with the audience, cast, and committee members. Victoria B. Cejas, who drove over an hour to see the show, expressed her expectations for the show.
“Joy. And a celebration. And comfort, right? Because I listen to the salsa and I feel like I’m home,” she said.
CORRECTION: Jan. 30, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that a play covered a Puerto Rican family's immigration to the United States. In fact, Puerto Rico is part of the United States.

Most people can relate to the idea of escape: whether from a physical environment, into a world of artistic expression, or even to a place of comfort among friends and family. It made a relatable theme, then, for Harvard College’s oldest dance organization, The Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company (HRMDC), who presented their fall show titled “an escape” on October 11 and 12, 2019. Much like the title suggests, the show is a conglomeration of dance pieces meant to convey several different perspectives on the idea of “an escape.” Separated into two acts, the show pushed the boundaries of modern dance through intense expression of emotion and presented HRMDC’s fascinating interpretations of “escape” in a raw and organic fashion.
The evidently deliberate selection of music for the routines corroborated their meanings and enhanced the performances. This notion particularly held true for routines like “Summertime Magic,” an illustration of escaping into arguably the best aspects of summertime: warmth, friendship, and relaxation, choreographed by Cassandra Kane ’21. Accordingly, the routine featured songs like “Escape (The Piña Colada Song)” by Ruper Holmes, an appropriate reference given the theme of the show and also a nostalgia-inducing classic. Of course, they could not have omitted the routine’s namesake “Summertime Magic” by Childish Gambino, inspiring funky and fluid movements with a modern hiphop-feel from dancers Rhea M. Bennett ’20, Jess L. Eng ’21, an active Crimson Arts editor, Mma G. Ikwut-Ukwa ’20, Camryn D. Jones ’22, Lydia Pan ’21, Noah B. Ramos ’21, and David Zhu ’21. The routine also features “Chachacá” by Joseán Log, bringing a bit of Latin flavor into the dance as the third cultural interpretation of “an escape” into “Summertime Magic.”
Sam F. Dvorak ’23, also known as Sam Sam the Magic Man, launched Act Two with an engaging magic trick — a simple yet efficacious sleight of hand — providing a lighthearted segue into the routine “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t” choreographed by Margaret T. Canady ‘20 and Jess L. Eng ‘21. A clear reference to the movie “Now You See Me” released in 2013, the routine initially featured dancers dressed in secret agent jackets and on a mission — this portion of the routine was set to the song “Mission: Impossible Theme” by Michael Giacchino — but then transitioned into witty and humor-filled choreography, as the dancers performed classic magic tricks such as pulling a seemingly endless length of rainbow streamers from their mouths. The fusion of performative magic and dance was a delightful “escape” from some of the more intense and focused routines.
Unorthodox pieces like “press start” and “Bandstand” were a testament to HRMDC’s dedication to supporting innovative student choreography and performance. The show’s program asserted that “press start ensues the simultaneity of a roaming player and someone seated pushing buttons.” Without the program, this description might not have been immediately obvious, but perhaps the subtlety was the point.
“Press start” was a physical manifestation of ordered chaos. The choreography was predominantly made up of workout movements that relied on “resistance” to suggest an imperceptible viscous substance through which the dancers were moving. The dancers’ seemingly spontaneous movements appeared erratic at first glance, but their systematic nature became apparent at a macro-level of observation, a phenomenon that characterizes some of the best varieties of modern dance.
Another standout piece was “Bandstand,” which referenced American Bandstand Dance Contests of the 20th century. A black and white taping of one of the television airings of that competition began the routine. After that introduction, the choreography was set to “Bo Gosse” by Disiz La Peste, who is a French rapper, and included a solo by Owen Torrey ‘21. Owen’s solo intriguingly incorporated a microphone attached to a long cord as his only prop, and the piece diverged into robotic, yet organic maneuvers by the dancers. A highly artistic use of lights and shadows with flashlights effectively accentuated and obscured the dancers at various moments in the piece. “Bandstand” was truly a highlight of the show, displaying Torrey’s innovative choreography.
Though individual pieces varied greatly in style and tone, suggesting a seeming lack of continuity, the common thread of “an escape” still tied them all together. All in all, The Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company skillfully combined passion with “escape” symbolism via novel choreography that was both thought-provoking and inspiring.

An ensemble. That was my first thought as the Red Brigade, a procession of perfectly poised bodies cloaked in a red so vibrant it was almost entrancing, passed me by at Extinction Rebellion’s Flood the Seaport protest on September 27. It was an ensemble not only because of the striking unity of the group’s movement but because of the drama its synchronization produced. Its members’ white-painted faces looked twisted in agony as several of those in front raised their hands to the sky, as if to demand from the universe an answer for humanity’s destruction of the planet and so much of the precious life it supports. Through the spectacle of its fashion and coordinated collective movement, the Red Brigade uses bodies to sound the alarm about the climate crisis.
In many ways, the Red Brigade defies description. One article published about Flood the Seaport describes the group as an “international theatrical movement that attempts to draw attention to the climate crisis.” While this description captures what the Red Brigade is at its most basic level, its practices are far more nuanced. The surprising universality behinds its radical use of bodies as an expressive medium also compels public consciousness. Rather than warmly invite people into the climate movement, the Red Brigade forces them to confront the reality of the climate emergency with a challenge to use their own bodies in this artistic resistance.
From Boston to London, the Red Brigade has a uniform presence wherever it appears, manifesting in its distinct fashion. Their costumes — an artform in and of themselves — resemble an almost nightmarish combination of “The Handmaid’s Tale” characters and mimes. The striking contrast between their vibrant red apparel — bright red robes, long red gloves, headdresses pinned with red roses, and even red lipstick to complement — against the harrowing white of their face paint almost feels like a visual assault. As the group chooses red to symbolize the “common blood” of humans with non-human species, this assault seems to make visible the otherwise quiet violence of the dramatic loss of our non-human compatriots amidst the background of the sixth mass extinction.
Working in parallel with these eye-catching costumes, the Red Brigade is extremely deliberate in its movement. The nature of its procession alone requires significant coordination. Like a kind of modern dance, members craft tableaux that create a sense of harmony and collective stake, and which at once contradict and complement the otherwise discordant and disruptive nature of their appearance. Their unity reflects their vision for society’s relationship with the earth, making them appear as one body, rather than as individuals. This appearance of collective identity not only speaks to the principle of collective action in combating climate change, but also fosters a more imminent feeling of occupation in the spaces through which the Red Brigade passes. Such occupation invokes a sense of reclamation of the built environment, namely the city streets and tourist destinations, where their demonstrations convey the pervasiveness of ecological grief in daily life. To this end, the group also specifically aims to transform historic and conventionally tourist-centric spaces, including landmarks and monuments, into places of performance.
It is paradoxical, considering how much it disrupts business as usual, that the Red Brigade proceeds and performs in complete silence. The group’s lack of conventional communication reinforces its appearance as a cohesive and self-contained unit. In a way, this silence is all the more communicative. It reflects the pervasive threat of the climate emergency — when our words are insufficient to capture all that is on the line, it seems that our bodies must do the talking.
Also integral to the Red Brigades’s mission and impact is its accessibility. Following instructional videos online, anyone can become a Red Brigade member. It is a decentralized and community-organized project. This openness speaks to the universality of the body itself as an artform, and people’s complete authority over their bodies makes them a unique tool for expression and protest. How people choose to use them automatically makes a statement. It shows what people are willing to risk — that they are ready to put themselves metaphorically and physically, on the line. There is also a sense of simplicity in this action, a suggestion that individuals together are crucial to achieving a more just and sustainable society.
From its ornate red headdresses to its synchronized procession, the performative protest of the Red Brigade is redefining the notion of artistic resistance in the face of the climate emergency. The group channels ecological grief into a radical and transformative kind of public communication that is inspiring followers around the globe. Nothing about the Red Brigade or its message is usual; but then again, neither is anything about the crisis it hopes to combat.
— Contributing writer Ilana Cohen’s '22 column, “Expressions of the Climate Emergency” is a nonfiction column that discusses artistic response and resistance to the climate crisis.

What is economics? To experts like Harvard Economics professor Raj Chetty ’00, economics is a science: Economists form hypotheses, gather data to test those hypotheses, and draw conclusions. If economics is a science, though, why do economists disagree? According to Chetty, disagreement in the field can be traced to methodological shortcomings. The lack of lab-like settings to run randomized controlled trials forces economists to resort to quasi-experimental methods and econometric wizardry. Though this imperfect form of experimentation causes disagreement, as the field progresses, methodologies will improve and data will become more readily available. Given time, Chetty argues, the field of economics will be as scientific as medicine.
This conception of economics is steadily gaining momentum at Harvard. Chetty teaches a course titled “Economics 50: Using Big Data to solve Economic and Social Problems,” which prides itself on introducing Harvard undergraduates to the world of economic research. For example, with the help of Harvard Economics professor Nathaniel Hendren and University of California, Berkeley Economics professors Emmanuel Saez and Patrick Kline, Chetty analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data to illustrate the causal effect of neighborhoods on upward mobility. Their policy recommendations include making investments in low-opportunity areas and helping families move to other locations. With the proper econometric training, students will be able to replicate their findings and perhaps craft policy proposals on their own.
While advances in data analysis have given researchers, students, and policymakers great insight into the surrounding world, Chetty and other econometric magicians are trying to turn economics into something it cannot and should not be. The direct step from statistical research to policy making dangerously masks the normative realities of crafting legislation.
The methodology of medicine is roughly as follows: Utilizing randomized control trials, researchers find treatments to cure the ailments of a population. Chetty likens the economist to a type of doctor. The ailments are of a different nature (unemployment, poverty, inequality, etc.), and so are the treatments (taxes, regulation, the lack thereof, etc.), but according to him, the paradigm is fundamentally the same.
Economics and medicine, however, are very different. One defining characteristic of policy making is its medium: the state. Passing legislation necessitates reflection on normative positions regarding the function of government. Some examples of such considerations include: What is the proper role of government? What defines a government that acts justly? Should morality be the impetus for policy creation? Who should the government prioritize if a policy has winners and losers?
Take the debate surrounding unemployment insurance. A simple policy question would be: Should the government grant a 10-week extension in unemployment benefits to those out of work?
According to Chetty, consensus has been reached:“[S]tudies have uniformly found that a 10-week extension in unemployment benefits raises the average amount of time people spend out of work by at most one week. This simple, unassailable finding implies that policy makers can extend unemployment benefits to provide assistance to those out of work without substantially increasing unemployment rates.”
The certainty is extraordinary. Let us assume, as he does, that this finding is incontrovertible (which is a generous assumption, given that there is at least one study concluding otherwise). Does it immediately follow that 10-week extension policies are desirable, given such remarkable evidence? No, it does not, and for good reason.
This policy, like all government policy, has winners and losers. The winners seem obvious — those who receive the unemployment extension. The losers are less obvious, but it would be a mistake to assume they don’t exist. One potential ramification of the policy is an increase in government spending and subsequent increase in the national debt, which could lead to disastrous long-term consequences for the entire population. Policymakers need to ask themselves if the debt accumulation is worth it or not. The question, like all of welfare economics is centered on interpersonal utility comparison: To what extent should we sacrifice overall welfare in the future for the welfare of the disadvantaged today? Another area of concern is justice. Is it just to redistribute money from those who have jobs to those who do not? Again, this question gets at interpersonal utility comparison, as well as a whole host of other normative judgements.
Positive certainties do not lead to policy certainties. As elementary as normative economics seem, economists today tend to shy away from such philosophical discussions. Moral claims and debates about justice are often vague and subjective, and “big data” offers little help. The experts of the field, however, should not so readily abandon normative considerations, at least if they wish to continue making direct or indirect policy recommendations. On the contrary, policymakers need to be honest about which value sets they take on and why they choose to take them. This isn’t to say econometrics should be abandoned. Positive and normative deliberation working in tandem is essential to good economics. Incorporating both into policy discussions will lead not only to better policies, but also to a more genuine public discourse.

When we think of activism, writing — perhaps a blog post or a tweet — is not the first thing that comes to mind. Activism seems to invoke something more bodily: picketing, marching, signs thrust in the air for hours, yelling into a bullhorn until your voice is hoarse, your point hopefully communicated. A collection of words strung together on a page doesn’t carry quite the same tune as a protest chant.
Yet there is something to be said about the momentum of the written word. It can be a powerful thing in the activist’s toolbox for promoting a limitless set of causes, even if the tools of writing itself are quite different from what one might expect to see at a rally: a couple of keystrokes, backspacing, or a play with a punctuation mark or two. But not always appreciated is the ability to have a universal audience at one’s fingertips, to have the ability to share one’s voice precisely and thoughtfully, or advocate for a particular reform. This is powerful.
Writing, in its many forms — journalism, novels, reports, reviews, social media blurbs — is necessarily contingent on this strong belief in change. And activism, a series of demonstrations of one’s desire for social reform, reflects this change. The act of writing, as author Margaret Atwood put it, imagines a future reader, thus imagining a future — one that could be influenced by said writing. And as author Nadine Gordimer put it, writing is “one’s unique contribution to social change.” As a vessel for communicating one’s idea, it’s difficult to imagine a form of writing that doesn’t have roots in change.
That isn’t to say all forms of writing are equal. It’s impossible to draw a strict comparison between the groundbreaking and immensely impactful works of writers like Toni Morrison or Joan Didion to yesterday’s Medium post, or the latest on Harvard Confessions. There are different spheres of writing that have different ends in themselves, and not all of them are intended to effect change. But what all writing does share is a transfer of knowledge at its core, regardless of audience or intent — laying ideas and words alongside each other, flat on a page or screen. The stories we tell, fictitious or true, can help us understand the ideas of others, and influence social behavior.
The implications of thinking about writing in this way are enormous. Yes, writing can delight, it can instruct, it can entertain, it can reveal — and often do all of those at the same time. But it can also call to action.
Writing diverges from protest in an important way; while it can be a call to action, it can only go so far. Simply writing about prison divestment, for example, will not immediately change the state of incarcerated people currently suffering in an egregious prison system. Neither will writing about racism, sexism, bigotry, or any of society’s sins suddenly promise a wave of change, cresting and crashing into a movement. Other forms of activism — policy making, demonstrating, sit-ins, strikes — are absolutely critical for reaching an ultimate goal of reform in their respective domains.
But just as important as considering different forms of activism, or what to write about, is who to write for. Writing does not always form the same immediate sensory jolt that viewing a protest or a demonstration can create. But what writing lacks in this sense of immediacy, it makes up for in the universality of its audience. Undoubtedly, there’s an element of passion in both that captures its beholders; yet writing extends beyond a mere passerby. Words have the ability to transcend environmental or situational restraints and grab hold of a reader’s intention, implore them to stay a while, and consider the thoughts held between their letters. In this, writing’s ability to inspire other actors holds the potential for other forms of activism to follow in its footsteps.
Not all writing is activism, just as not all activism is writing. But we do ourselves a disservice if we don’t consider the implications of the written word to effect just as much change — if not more — as a more sudden, physical activist movement. Ideas of change are powerful. And the words and the stories we use to tell these ideas have the potential to spark great movements.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The advent of the digital age has transformed our relationships with our common spaces, and the way those common spaces are constructed. One of the spaces most ubiquitous in the life of a college student — the campus library — is hardly immune from this trend. But the merits of updating libraries for the 21st century are questionable, and many consider such adjustments unnecessary, citing survey data that indicates students simply want a place to work quietly, access books, and print assignments.
The future of Harvard libraries must strike a balance between preserving its historic character and functions and the modernization that has been the hallmark of recent years. In 2017, Cabot Library was renovated with a more modern design and amenities. Just last fall the Smith Campus Center opened, offering plenty of new study spaces in a radically different style from the traditional library setting. And the University is showing no sign of slowing down — Houghton Library is currently undergoing renovations intended to increase accessibility.
We appreciate the Harvard Library system, and the many functions it serves at the University and in the wider academic world, first and foremost providing access to centuries of accumulated knowledge. That said, we understand that libraries may feel the need to implement technological updates in order to appeal to students. While doing so is an important part of ensuring libraries stay relevant, we hope the Harvard Library stays true to its original character.
To be certain, we believe providing free technological resources and makerspaces to students, as well as designing libraries for collaborative use, can be incredibly enriching to the Harvard experience. However, students should still learn how to search the archives and navigate Harvard libraries’ resources for research purposes. While some courses and concentrations already teach this skill, we believe that all students should have this knowledge. The Harvard Library ought to consider teaching students to use it more effectively, in part by extensively partnering with certain classes, beyond the basic lesson in using HOLLIS that College students receive as they complete their expository writing requirement. The Harvard Library is something we should all feel like we have ownership of, as a system and collection of documents that reflects the world around us.
Students may not be entirely aware of the role they can play in pursuit of that goal. Ensuring that Harvard Library’s extensive archives are as inclusive and representative as possible of diverse sources of knowledge and history is the work of the collective student body. Students can call for the library to add to its collection or expand its offerings and yield results, and the library system ought to encourage students to take such an active role. We appreciate the availability of librarians in this and all processes, and we hope that students take more advantage of their presence and willingness to engage.
The world is changing, and the way we access media and information continues to evolve. Harvard Library has certainly changed in some regards to accommodate this evolution, but it has not yet and never should abdicate its goal of providing the University and the world as a whole with the knowledge we need to understand our past and move towards a better future.

Big Bird bounds across the stage in Sanders Theatre.
“I’m here to meet my new friend, Larry Ba-ca-caw!” he wheezes. At 8 foot 2 inches and 300 pounds of yellow fluff, Big Bird towers over University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who stands at the podium in a pinstriped suit. The two go back-and-forth on whether Bacow is, in fact, a bird. Later in the show, Elmo bemoans how difficult it was to apply to Harvard, and Grover describes a day in his life as a tenured physics professor.
The audience, ranging from local Cambridge residents to Harvard professors, laughs, albeit tepidly. It is not often, after all, that the Muppets perform for a room full of adults.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of Sesame Street. In between performances from the show’s beloved cast, Harvard affiliates recount what are, to many, little-known stories about the longstanding ties between Harvard and Sesame Street.
Sesame Street emerged in the 1960s as a response to the nationwide discussion about educational disparities. The Coleman Report, published in 1966, determined that the most important factors in a child’s academic success was their family background and diversity in the classroom, rather than the quality of their school. Around the same time, pediatrician Julius B. Richmond proved that poverty hinders the cognitive development of young children; lower-income students learned fewer words than their counterparts and struggled to understand abstract concepts later on.
Sesame Street sought to level the playing field by repeatedly exposing children to new words and concepts through catchy songs. For creators Joan G. Cooney and Lloyd N. Morrisett, television was the ideal medium to do this. If done well, the show could reach millions of families.
The two turned to Harvard to pursue their goal.
Then-Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences McGeorge Bundy, and Graduate School of Education lecturer Harold Howe, provided the initial funding for the show. Sesame Street’s founders also sought out human capital at the University, tapping researchers to develop the show’s curriculum and alumni to compose the accompanying songs.
Chief amongst Harvard’s contributors was professor Gerald S. Lesser, who served as chair of the show’s advisory board, Sesame Workshop, for 30 years. He shaped the pedagogy of the show, translating insights from academic research to Sesame Street’s programming.
During the celebration in Sanders, HGSE Dean Bridget Terry Long spoke about how “innovative and radically transformative” Sesame Street was.
HGSE professor emerita Courtney B. Cazden, who served as a consultant on children’s language development, remembers being thrilled to be included in the conversation about creating a T.V. show, a rarity for academics. “I as a researcher got the chance to talk to television producers who otherwise, I dare say, would never speak with me,” she says.
Lesser’s model worked. Within ten years, the show had become a household staple: nine million American kids were watching it every day.
Cooney and Morrisett realized that the show could teach kids much more than just their ABCs and 123s; it could teach them to be kind and accepting of others. Harvard Medical School psychiatry professor Chester M. Pierce ’48 had long advocated for the representation of people of color and other minorities within the media, which Sesame Street quickly adopted as a core element of the show.
According to Judith S. Palfrey, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School who served as a medical consultant for the show, this push for inclusion was tied to the show’s emphasis on the social and emotional skills kids needed to succeed.
Jeffery D. Dunn ’77, president of Sesame Workshop, says that at its core, Sesame Street hopes to address the “dearth of content on important but difficult subjects for kids and families of this age group,” to “become the Google for these matters,” covering topics like pregnancy, disability, and death.
As the show at Sanders ends, Dunn is joined by his fellow speakers and the Muppets on stage, who urge the audience to sing along to Sesame Street classic, “Sing a Song.” Elmo coaxes the audience: “Don’t worry if you sound bad!”

A tall man wrapped in a long skunk-fur-print cape and sporting a top hat decked with glowing lights greets me at Bow Market in Somerville. The circular horn beside him features boldly painted text reading “This sousaphone kills fascists.” Over the din of the crowd, I overhear someone call the coming night “the wokest fun there is.”
Inside Bow Market, a local marketplace-turned-backstage-area, musicians tune their instruments in a cacophony of brass. Groups cluster themselves by costume, adorned in everything from Victorian steampunk to mushroom hats to Super Mario Bros. outfits. Every instrument is as decked out as its player, whether with revolutionary slogans or Christmas lights tangled around the brass.
Out of the sonic chaos, melodies emerge. Soon, there’s a band lined up, ready for the crowd.
The street bands gathered in this rainy, Somerville square have come from around the country — and world — for the Honk! Festival, a three-day event held each Indigenous Peoples’ Day weekend for activist street bands to parade, party, and play in support of their respective, broadly leftist causes.
​​​​​​
In addition to the all-band revue that takes place at Bow Market on Friday, the festival consists of several marches that culminate two days later in the Honk! Parade, traveling from from Davis Square to Harvard Square for the kick-off of Cambridge’s Oktoberfest.
For now, though, situated between a microbrewery and a kale smoothie cafe, Honk! is just getting started.
As bystanders wrap up their evening shopping, the sudden reverberations of a jazzy reimagining of Darth Vader’s Imperial March followed by Brazilian protest chants halts them in their tracks. Onlookers soon abound.
Those who stay get to experience everything from a “Where’s Waldo”-themed act to a performance from a band formed in memory of Emperor Norton, an early inhabitant of San Francisco who, in 1859, declared himself “Emperor of the United States” and went on to print his own currency.
The members of this latter band, “Emperor Norton’s Stationary Marching Band,” are exceptionally proud of their namesake, whom their page on the Honk! website claims “is not dead; he is waiting to be awakened in each of us” as he is “a manifestation of the absurd and unusual forces of the universe.”
On the bus to the festival, I get to experience a taste of the “absurd and unusual” — sitting next to me happens to be one of the top mentors in the School of Honk!, a person replete with stories and wisdom about the festival and its origins.
I learn from this man, who goes only by his first name, Carlos, that the festival itself began when the Second Line Social Aid and Pleasure Society, a street band from Somerville, realized in the early 2000s that it was not the only street band making social and political statements with its performances.
Since 2006, Second Line has been gathering with like-minded street bands from around the country and bringing brass-toned calls for justice to the Greater Boston-area.
​​​​​​
The event, now officially hosted by the School of Honk — a music program for street performers — also taps into the tradition of European and South America musical activism.
This year, in addition to the Brazilian feminist musical collective, “Fanfarra Feminina Sagrada Profana” (the Sacred Unholy Female Fanfare), the Honk! lineup includes “Environmental Encroachment, Chicago;” ‘The Young Fellaz’ from New Orleans; and the “Bolschewistische Kurkapelle Schwarz–Rot” (the Bolshevik Holiday Orchestra Black–Red, according to their website), whose members regale us with the classic protest songs they played under East German rule.
I ask Carlos what keeps drawing him back to Honk!; he responds in parable. Quoting Gaddar, the Indian poet and activist, Carlos tells me a story: Gaddar was once asked, “What do we need to change?” The answer: “Everything.” In response, he was asked, “Where do you start?” The reply: “Anywhere.”
“I just happen to be playing music,” Carlos says. “So this is where I enact my change. In this corner, this is what we do to push history.”
As the night pushes onwards and the umpteenth band edges toward the crowd, the dancing takes on a frenzied pitch. Its formation dissolves as its members mingle with the crowd, and the distinction between performer and onlooker blurs. A trombone player just behind my ear startles me senseless, his horn emitting a piercing, joyous note. In the midst of chants against oppression, raised fists in the crowd start to sway to the beat.
As the rhythm picks up through the night, the staccato refrain of “Hey, hey, hey, hey,” rarely heard outside of college mosh pits, emerges out of the crowd. This time, however, it comes from the voices of seven-year-olds to 70-year-olds, and it entirely lacks the usual manic rush to the center that inevitably ends with an elbow to the ribs.
The dancing is just as convulsive, but punctuated with warnings against the iceberg’s melting, immigration raids, and authoritarian futures. Soon, a man locks arms with me, and we start clumsily dancing in circles together. Some tremendous catharsis is at hand; dystopian loomings turn bacchanal as a man in a pink bunny suit saunters across the stage, hammering out beats.

William G. Kaelin Jr., a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a researcher at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, is one of three winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work in determining how cells sense and adapt to the presence of oxygen. This discovery is expected to have implications for the treatment of diseases like cancer and anemia. Fifteen Minutes sat down with Kaelin to discuss the philosophy behind his research, the welcomeness of unexpected experimental results, and whether or not he normally wears button downs at 5 a.m.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Fifteen Minutes: Your research is considered a breakthrough in basic science research. As a cancer researcher, how do you reconcile the ‘big picture’ work of your lab with a more focused view of fundamental biological processes?
William Kaelin: I see things as a continuum starting with fundamental mechanistic work, and if you're lucky, along the way you hopefully create opportunities to actually do things with that knowledge. In our case, my work started with a hereditary cancer syndrome, where we were looking at individuals who had a high risk of developing a number of different tumors, including kidney cancers, because they had inherited a defective version of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. We thought this was an opportunity to learn about oxygen sensing, which would be important in a variety of diseases, both cancerous and non-cancerous. We thought we would learn something about the control of angiogenesis [development of new blood vessels], which we knew from the work of Judah Folkman and many others, might create an opportunity to blunt tumor growth by blocking their ability to induce new blood vessels. And then finally, we thought the VHL gene would be sort of a Rosetta Stone for understanding what makes a kidney cancer a kidney cancer, since the activity of the gene is predisposed to kidney cancer.
So I think it's more of a continuum, but I think the truism here is you can't start out simply to say, “I want to do something applied,” and have a chance of doing something really transformative unless you roll up your sleeves and first understand the system you're working on a bit better.
FM: How has your personal philosophy influenced your research philosophy?
WK: When I was completing my clinical training, I did so with the anticipation that I was going to wind up being a clinical doctor. I thought it would be intellectually stimulating and that there would be lots of clinical puzzles to solve to help patients. But as I went on with my training and did my fellowship in clinical oncology at Dana Farber, it became very clear to me that our understanding of most cancers I was seeing was wholly inadequate. I was watching patients suffer because of our collective ignorance about the real molecular basis of the tumors they had. That motivated me tremendously to try, in any way I could, to help us generate that kind of missing knowledge. But I also think having been a physician really grounded me, because you're reminded that there are patients counting on us to do better and to generate new knowledge. It's not about how many papers you published, or what societies you got elected to, or what prizes you won. It's about publishing things that are true and can help your other colleagues then move forward.
FM: A lot of people assume that to be a successful scientist and researcher, you have to keep a lot of your discoveries closely guarded. But there seems to be a sense of a ‘people-first’ strategy that permeates your own career. How do you think this has affected your research and your career?
WK: First of all, I want to debunk a couple commonly held myths, and one is that scientists don't like to share, and they don't like to work with one another. Especially today, where so many experiments have gotten so complex, you usually can't survive without collaborating with other scientists. And while there is an issue of people keeping their findings secret, there’s also a tremendous pressure on people to go public with their findings. There’s an assumption that someone else out there is competing with you, and that if you’re going to be successful, you have to get it in the public domain. I would say there is pressure to publish too early, and that’s a shame because it takes more time to do the work carefully and methodically. I think it’s a balancing act. You certainly don’t want people holding data back that could help many other people, but at the same time, if you rush and you’re too premature, things can start to get a little sloppy and you start to disseminate some things that actually aren't true.
FM: What keeps you going when your expectations for your research don’t align with the outcome?
WK: I actually welcome unexpected results, because if every result you get is expected, then you’re probably not doing science; you’re doing engineering or something rather pedestrian. A good scientist should always be on the lookout for unexpected results, and should welcome them, because a lot of important discoveries actually start with unexpected results. In fact, I’ve heard more than one Nobel Prize winner say that some results might have led to a Nobel Prize but ended up in a trash bin because scientists couldn’t quite get a handle on their results. So they assume they’ve done something wrong when in fact, if they’d thought about it a little more deeply and were more receptive to other explanations, they would have seen that they were really onto something.
FM: As you’ve gone through your career, how has your view on the state of research and academia changed over time? 
WK: The kind of experiments I admire, and the scientists I admire, do experiments that are a bit off the beaten path. That's our aspiration –– to do experiments that are pretty and witty. I do think sometimes, the technology is so powerful and attractive that people gravitate in the direction of technology, whereas I tend to start off with, “What's the biological question we're trying to address?” And then I'll figure out what technology I need, versus some people who start with the technology and then try to figure out what questions they can answer.
FM: Our last question is about all the news articles we've seen of you. In each of them, you're on the phone and wearing a button down. We were wondering: were those photos staged, or did you happen to be wearing a button down at five in the morning?
WK: Well, I got my phone call at twenty ‘til five, so that gave me time to shower, shave, and get dressed. And then the phone started ringing right after the press conference, which was like 5:45 a.m., and by 6 a.m. I had photographers buzzing at my doorbell.

The Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard was founded because of the Cold War.
In 1953, the Committee on International and Regional Studies sent a proposal to Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 calling for the establishment of the Center on the basis of Harvard’s “international commitment to counter the Soviet threat in the Middle East, the fundamental importance of Middle Eastern oil to our economy, and the continuing crisis in the region.”
The Cold War was, overall, a boon to American higher education. Universities across the country were expanding — not in the name of scholarly research, but in the name of national security. And they did so on the government’s dime: In 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act, which provided federal funding to educational programs that sought to benefit national security and U.S. economic interests. Harvard’s CMES was one of the first centers to receive funding under Title VI of this act.
***
In March of this year, Palestinian rapper Tamer Nafar performed “Mama, I Fell in Love with a Jew” at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a song about a Palestinian man falling in love with an Israeli woman. Nafar — whose music focuses on human rights in the Middle East — had been invited by the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies to participate in a conference about the conflict over Gaza. An edited clip showing about thirty seconds of Nafar’s evening-long performance began circulating on the Internet.
The clip is incriminating. “I need your help. I can’t be anti-Semitic alone, try it with me together,” Nafar says to the audience before singing “Mama, I Fell in Love with a Jew,” which he describes as his “anti-Semitic song.” The clip, shot and edited by conservative filmmaker and Fox News correspondent Ami Horowitz, then shows the audience standing and cheering. The Duke-UNC Consortium later clarified that the standing and cheering shown in the clip was from a different part of the concert.
Nevertheless, the clip found itself in the hands of North Carolina State Representative George E.B. Holding, who brought it to Betsy DeVos’s attention in an April letter. Holding urged the Department of Education to investigate the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies. Specifically, Holding wanted to know if the conference had received funds from Title VI of the National Defense Education Act.
***
Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies stopped receiving funding from Title VI several years ago, according to Lauren Montague, executive director of Harvard’s CMES. The Center receives enough money from its endowment and private sources, so Title VI funds had been merely supplementary, anyway. The Duke-UNC Consortium, however, does receive Title VI funding from the Department of Education. The Duke-UNC Consortium declined to comment on this story.
In August, following its investigation, the United States Department of Education sent a letter to Duke and UNC ordering them to restructure their Middle East Studies program if they wanted their Title VI funding to be renewed. The letter was sent about a month before the Department of Education was set to vote on which universities would receive Title VI funds for the 2019-2020 academic year.
In the letter, the Department of Education wrote that too few courses offered by Duke-UNC focused on “the historic discrimination faced by, and current circumstances of, religious minorities in the Middle East, including Christians, Jews, Baha’is, Yazidis, Kurds, Druze and others.” The letter also stated that not enough classes offered by the consortium “support[ed] the development of foreign language and international expertise for the benefit of U.S. national security and economic stability.” This is, according to the letter, “unlawful.” The Duke-UNC consortium failed to distinguish activities “lawfully funded under Title VI” — that is, the programming that would fall under the national security and economic interest criteria outlined in 1958 — from those which don’t qualify.
***
According to the Department of Education’sletter to Duke and UNC, the consortium’s former projects such as a conference on “Love and Desire in Modern Iran” or a book entitled "Mihri Hatun: Performance, Gender-Bending and Subversion in the Early Modern Ottoman Intellectual History," written by a member of Duke’s faculty, are among the programming that “have little or no relevance to Title VI.”
“Although Iranian art and film may be subjects of deep intellectual interest and may provide insight regarding aspects of the people and culture of the Middle East, the sheer volume of such offerings highlights a fundamental misalignment between your choices and Title VI's mandates,” Assistant Secretary for Post-Secondary Education Robert L. King wrote in the letter.
Jesse C. Howell, academic programs manager for the CMES at Harvard, says he doesn’t see why “a more nuanced understanding of a place like Iran, including its queer cinematic tradition, is somehow inherently separated from this core mission of supporting U.S. security interests in the Middle East.”
Understanding more than a region’s economic and military resources is important for making effective U.S. foreign policy, according to Howell. “You can’t separate the political from the cultural, if you want to have a lasting impact,” he says.
The federal government hasn’t always dictated Title VI funding with such surgical precision.
Since Title VI was created, “the model has been interpreted in a pretty flexible and loose way,” says Harvard Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92. It has been up to individual universities to determine what programming does or does not promote national security and economic interests under Title VI. “The norm has not been for that to be questioned by the federal government,” says Feldman.
Feldman describes this abrupt move away from the traditionally loose interpretation of Title VI as “striking.”
***
It’s striking, but not surprising. The letter reflects the current leadership of the U.S. Department of Education. Kenneth L. Marcus, the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the DoED, has been accused by critics of using his position, which is designed to enforce the civil rights protections of marginalized groups, to advocate a pro-Israel standpoint.
Before working in the DoED, Marcus founded the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, which lobbied the Education Department and Congress to reform Middle East studies programs that, according to the center, possessed anti-Israel bias. Last September, in his position as head of civil rights at the DoED, Marcus reopened a seven-year-old case brought by a Zionist group, the Zionist Organization of America, against Rutgers University. Marcus argued that this case was within the purview of his position because, according to him, Rutgers had discriminated against and provided a hostile environment for Jewish students. As President Trump has tightened his alliance with Israel, Marcus’ actions parallel the administration's political leanings.
The letter sent to Duke and UNC is in line with these efforts, and others, that Marcus has made in the past year to delegitimize and defund Middle East studies programs that he argues are biased against Israel.
Feldman says that attempts by the federal government to demand a certain viewpoint from universities compromise academic freedom. “If the government wants to train people in a particular set of skills, it's not in theory absurd that the government would want to check up and make sure people are actually being trained in those set of skills,” said Feldman. But, under the First Amendment, government funding must be “viewpoint neutral.” This means that “[t]he government can't use its funding in a conditional way to promote a particular viewpoint that the government likes or disfavor a particular viewpoint that it doesn’t like,” he said.
***
After many organizations decried the First Amendment violations in the letter, last month, the Department of Education voted to renew funding for the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies for the 2019-2020 academic year. Still, members of Harvard’s CMES are worried the letter will affect its own Middle East Studies programming under the Trump administration.
“My fear is self-censorship. Not overt censorship, but the fact that people may not feel comfortable bringing forward ideas, because they're afraid of hypermedia attention that can be misconstrued if you're not an expert in these programs,” says Lauren Montague, executive director of Harvard’s CMES. “Middle Eastern Studies is such a keen area of expertise that is needed, that this kind of a volley attacking the very limited funding for these kinds of programs that the government supports,” says Montague.
“It's chilling. The thought that someone would come in and hyper-analyze all of your choices, I think could potentially incapacitate you from your programming,” Montague says. She adds that she feels lucky that Harvard’s CMES is not reliant on Title VI funding and does not have to fear this level of scrutiny.
Still, Feldman says that the letter could nevertheless have consequences for the work of Harvard’s CMES, Title VI funding or no Title VI funding. The research and writing done in universities doesn’t happen in isolation. Instead, it’s “part of a broader ecosystem,” he says.
“It sets the tone for the question of academic freedom across the entire academic community. Even if we're not affected in an immediate way, we're affected in a direct way through the question of: What's the environment for research? What's the environment for academic freedom?”

Swarms of chocoholic pilgrims wander in search of edible alms. The New England Chocolate Festival’s Chocolate Pavilion has officially overtaken the Cyclorama at Boston Center for the Arts, a mammoth, hexadecagon-shaped building.
At the entrance, two women sit at a table with a handwritten sign for the “BOSTON Chocolate Club meet up.” Everyone is here: Cacao producers, chocolate makers, chocolatiers, chocolate sellers, chocolate consumers, the world’s wannabe Willy Wonkas, and even Harvard faculty members.
Carla D. Martin ’03 is a lecturer on African and African American Studies at Harvard and the executive director of the Fine Cacao and Chocolate Institute, which organized the festival. At Harvard, she teaches a course called “Chocolate, Culture, and the Politics of Food,” which will be offered in the spring semester. Martin introduces me to many of the festival’s vendors and explains the nuances of chocolate production.
“Hershey’s, Mars, Nestle —” her voice fades into silence after naming these large companies. What Martin calls “mass-manufactured commercial chocolate” overshadows the importance of how chocolate is produced, she claims, because commercial companies emphasize consistency and quantity — not quality. “If you pick up a Hershey’s Kiss in Nebraska,” she explains, “and three years later pick one up in Massachusetts, the idea is that you know exactly what to expect.”
Yet, chocolate comes from a crop — cacao — and like any crop, the source determines the harvest. Every region, farm, and pod will produce something distinct. A friendly educational section of the festival explains the complexities of chocolate production, nitty-gritty details that are not found on most candy labels.
First, the cacao pods: hefty, bright red and yellow oval fruits, with ridges running all around. Cut one of the pods open and discover white, gooey pulp around soft, squishy beans. The pulp can be processed into cacao juice, a sickly sweet superfood advertised to be high in potassium and magnesium. Roast the beans, and they harden and brown, with crunchy, bitter cacao nibs inside. Separate the cocoa butter from the solids, add sugar and milk to taste, and you’ll have delectable chocolate.
One ingredient, though, is a source of controversy and spite among chocolate devotees: emulsifier lecithin granules. Widely used in commercial chocolate, lecithin granules make chocolate smoother, but suppress the natural flavor of the bean. Many craft chocolate-makers have shunned lecithin for the sake of authenticity and minimalism.
According to Martin, the contemporary chocolate connoisseur is motivated by flavor, narrative, and authenticity.
Flavor has captured most attendees' attention, it seems, due to the overabundance of free samples. Every inch of wallspace hosts a booth, each serving multiple samples that draw crowds of hungry patrons.
Folks chatter about “the fermentary process” and how “as an American, it horrifies me!” Makers and chocolatiers do their best to seem unique. “Our white chocolate is made with grass fed cows,” one maker tells me, “and you can really taste the grassy notes.”
There are some oddities. Bee pollen chocolate sounds mildly disgusting, tastes shockingly normal, and has an unclear reason for existence. Beer-infused chocolate initially tastes normal but makes your mouth feel like you’ve swigged a Guinness about 30 seconds after swallowing.
Two central displays, Dominican cacao and Quebecois chocolatiers, stressed narratives about their chocolate. One Dominican farm, Zorzal Cacao, highlighted its role as a 1,019-acre bird sanctuary. Quebec is still developing its artisanal chocolate scene, and corporate chocolate is as popular in Montreal as in Montana. The Quebecois chocolatiers, donning ascot caps, spoke in thick accents about their mission to liberate their people from mediocre sweets through their burgeoning bean-to-bar scene centered at the sleek shop État de choc on Saint Laurent Boulevard.
In the back of the festival stand many tall, wooden batons carved with jagged creases and abstract designs. These are molinillos, an ancient Aztec device used to whisk hot chocolate. There is a range of molinillo merchandise, including pens that are also fully functional mini-molinillos.
For two men present, molinillos are a passion. Juan Alonso Rodriguez, who works atop a platform with a range of woodcarving tools, is a fourth-generation artisan molinillo-maker. Alonso Rodriguez has traveled all over Mexico to demonstrate his mastery of the craft, but this is his first trip abroad. It takes him 30 minutes to carve a single molinillo; he has already made several today.
Molinillos “are an extraordinary device for producing… foamy, foamy chocolate,” explains Enrique Galindo, who researches molinillos at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Researching molinillos involves hydrodynamics, one-thousand-frame-per-second cameras, and plastic particles.

In February 1692, the tale of two young girls experiencing unexplained fits spiraled into rumors of witchcraft in Salem, Mass. The hysteria consumed the small town, resulting in a series of prosecutions and executions that would cement Salem’s infamous legacy for centuries.
Some 200 men, women, and children faced accusations of witchcraft, and a special court convened in Salem to hear their cases. Over the course of a little more than a year, 20 executions took place at the order of the nine judges sitting on the court.
Though Salem is 20 miles north of Cambridge, the trials did not occur without the influence of Harvard’s then-president Increase Mather, class of 1656.
Mather — the namesake of one of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate Houses — has recently come under scrutiny as residents of Mather House interrogated his legacy in a 2016 archival project. The Puritan minister owned a slave on campus in addition to playing a role in the Salem witch trials.
Though he held one of the most powerful positions in the colony at the time, Mather was not the sole Harvard man implicated in the witchcraft calamity. Included in this infamous cast were Nathaniel Saltonstall, class of 1659; Samuel Sewall, class of 1671 and a member of the Board of Overseers; and University treasurer John Richards, who all served as justices on the special witchcraft court.
Finally, presiding over this court was William Stoughton, class of 1650, a key Harvard donor and namesake of Stoughton Hall. Self-appointed advisor to this court was Cotton Mather, class of 1678.
Cotton Mather, a Puritan minister and prolific author, began his scholarship on witchcraft years before the trials commenced. He suggested that the devil had a presence in the colony in his 1689 book “Memorable Providences, Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions,” which recounts strange happenings within a Boston family whose housekeeper was eventually hanged for witchcraft.
In a 1994 interview, Folklore and Mythology chair Stephen A. Mitchell said Cotton Mather was “personally responsible” for the hanging of the alleged witch. Cotton Mather’s book has been cited by scholars as a major influence on the trials in Salem, and no wonder: “Memorable Providences” calls for the “Detection” and “Destruction” of those who allegedly practiced witchcraft.
Despite his incendiary rhetoric, Cotton Mather did caution the judges on the special witchcraft court against convicting a defendant solely on the basis of spectral evidence — evidence based on dreams and visions.
On June 15, 1692, soon after the court began hearing trials, Mather authored a report co-signed by several other ministers — including his father — that urged for “exquisite caution” in the proceedings. The report, however, did not go so far as to condemn the trials; indeed, it called for the “speedy and vigorous prosecution” of the witches.
In October 1692, Increase Mather published his own work titled “Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits,” which cautioned against the use of spectral evidence. He delivered the paper as a formal address to his fellow ministers, received their endorsement, and passed the work off to the governor for consideration.
“It is better that ten suspected witches should escape than that one innocent Person should be Condemned,” Mather wrote.
By the time this was published, however, the 20 executions had already taken place.
Increase Mather’s lateness to speak on the trials was not calculated, but rather the accidental byproduct of larger political schemes. Mather had been abroad in England for the entire spring, engaged in negotiations with the Crown over the colony’s recently revoked charter.
Alyssa G. A. Conary, co-founder of the Salem Historical Society, says the Mathers are frequently mistaken as the central figures in the administration of the trials.
“I think that there's sort of this popular idea of New England being a theocracy, of the Mathers dragging people off to jail,” Conary says. “They had no legal power, really. They're commenting on it, and they're giving the judges advice.”
“The Mathers are usually cast as arch villains in the story,” she adds. “But I think people think that they're more extraordinary than they actually were.”
Conary says the major “overlooked” players in the trials were judges such as Richards, Sewall, and Stoughton.
Chief amongst these “overlooked” judges was Willian Stoughton.
Increase Mather recommended that Stoughton, a friend of Cotton’s, assume the role of lieutenant governor in the colony in 1692. Stoughton’s newfound prominence in that role landed him a seat as the chief justice of the special witchcraft court that same year.
“I think Stoughton was out for blood,” Conary says.
He was a zealous — perhaps overzealous — justice; once, he commanded the jury to redeliberate after they found a 70-year-old woman not guilty. They reversed their verdict, and she was hanged.
Then-Massachusetts Governor William Phips disbanded the courts in October 1692, but Stoughton continued his crusade: He signed eight death warrants, even after the court had been dismissed. Phips halted the executions in 1693.
“When they shut down the court in 1693, he’s furious; he storms out of the room,” Conary says. “For me, personally, I really see him as one of the arch villains.”
Years after the trials, former University President Josiah Quincy, class of 1790, who resided in Stoughton Hall during his time at the College, penned a book detailing Harvard’s history. In it, he condemned the conduct of his former dorm’s namesake.
“If it were possible, it would be grateful to throw the mantle of oblivion over the part acted by Stoughton in that tragedy. But the stern law of history does not permit,” Quincy wrote.
As the chief justice, Stoughton never apologized for his role in the trials. But Sewall, a presiding judge, did issue a public apology in January 1697, which was read aloud at an event in Boston to memorialize those executed as a result of the trials.
“Samuel Sewall desires to take the Blame and shame of it, asking pardon of men,” the apology read. None of the other eight justices apologized — though Saltonstall resigned from the court, after becoming “dissatisfied” with the proceedings, according to a letter by Thomas Brattle, class of 1676, in which he condemned the witchcraft court’s haphazard methodology.
Despite Stoughton’s harsh comportement both during and after the trials, he became a key benefactor to Harvard. In 1698, he donated a thousand pounds for the construction of a new residence hall in his name. It was completed the following year.
The original Stoughton Hall — “an unsubstantial piece of masonry,” according to records — was razed in 1780 and replaced by a more stable successor of the same name. The original structure still stands in the background of Stoughton’s portrait, which hangs now in the faculty room of University Hall.
But despite “his noble donation to Harvard College,” Quincy wrote, “there is no class of public men, towards whom history should be more inexorably severe than to those, who, through fear, passion, or policy, lend themselves to popular excitements.”

When the clock strikes nine on Friday night, the next hour moves forward on its own accord.
Laptop closes, makeup bag opens; contents removed and applied systematically. First is always the eyeliner — that one’s tricky, for the wings to be sharp enough and long enough and even enough. Next comes eyeshadow, a glittery blend carefully perfected from three semesters of trial and error. Mascara, blush, highlighter, lip gloss. The mirror congratulates me on my handiwork. Dewier, brighter, and more vibrant; the canvas is complete.
I stopped having to think about it months ago. I know the drill.
Sometimes, I pretend I’m in one of those getting-ready-montage movie scenes, like the songs from Spotify’s latest pop playlist are actually my life’s perfectly-synced backup track. This would be the part when the girl dramatically parts her closet’s curtains and takes stock of her options — hands on her hips, contemplative.
The friends who raid my wardrobe say I have more tiny shirts than anyone. Admittedly, there are a lot — more variations of crop top that you can imagine, unified by the shared traits of being both tight and low-cut. My friends and I have all discussed our individual boob situations; I’ve finally figured out how to manipulate my smaller-than-average ones into their optimal positions so that they’re pushed-up, never flattened. I rotate through several possibilities before deciding. Maybe tonight, a microscopic stretchy grey thing will both strategically cover and reveal my body.
I return to the mirror, again, which tells me that the grey thing is doing exactly what it should. A moment of self-admiration; a quick adjustment of an eyelash, a change of earrings. Satisfied, I shut off the music, grab my jacket, and hurry off to wherever my friends are dancing.

High school policy debate is a weird mix of hyper-conservatism and hyper-liberalism. You start out applauding U.S. hegemony, progress to calling for the end of civil society, then go back again. Sophomore year of debate tends to be when most people experiment with radicality — this was the year that introduced me to gender studies.
Prior to the year, I had practiced the kind of straight-up feminism that had nothing to do with academia, that could simply articulate itself in ‘equality’ and ‘rights.’ Now, I pored over various strains of queer theory, feminist theory, and their intersections with other facets of identity. I wanted to know how to incorporate the ivory tower into everyday life.
That spring, I was preparing for a debate tournament when I stumbled upon an online interview with Judith Butler on the construction of gender. One quote particularly struck me: “Performativity… is not freedom, but a question of how to work the trap that one is inevitably in.”
***
It’s midnight, and we’ve finally reached our destination. Run through the rain, waited in line, got our names checked off, filed into a dark, pulsating room. The strobe lights flash red and blue and green, mingling and blurring like the mass of bodies beneath them.
Inside the mass, we dance. We dance with each other, against each other — a big group of girls amidst other big groups of girls, a boy or two hanging on the edges of each. These are the boys who got us into the party, powerful even if outnumbered. Or because they’re outnumbered.
We dance and sweat and look like we’re having fun, and we are, for the most part. Except when there’s a lull in the music, or when our friend has left to get another drink, and we survey the room, carefully. Scrutinizing the crowd to see whether we are being scrutinized. Trying to catch an eye, willing its owner toward us.
If we fail, we silently reassess our handiwork. We thought we knew how good it was — we were so proud of it before, as we floated through our autonomous routines. But perhaps it was never just ourselves that we wanted to impress.
***
I first went to a seven-week summer debate camp after sophomore year. Around the same time that I discovered Butler, debate helped me discover what I wanted in a community and those who comprised it.
The activity was, and still is, suffocatingly male-dominated; yet, in the muggy heat of Ann Arbor, Mich, I found myself surrounded by the kind of female friends I rarely encountered at my own high school. Our conversations seamlessly oscillated between international relations and debate boys; postmodernism and how ‘far’ we went with our latest hookup. We speed-argued about education policy for hours before drinking Four Lokos in the bathroom stall and raiding Urban Outfitters for crop tops.
My new friends and I carved out a space for ourselves and expanded it — in the stratified social scene of summer debate camp, through the oppressive tension of tournaments. They taught me that being smart and nerdy weren’t mutually exclusive with being hot and sexual and desired. We could deliberate over outfits and makeup each morning, purposely parade to debate lab in our tiniest shirts before handily beating the boys during practice debates.
Having fallen into Butler’s “inevitable trap,” we actively molded ourselves to fit its shape; performed our femininity in exactly the way that it’s supposed to be, sexualized and objectified our own bodies. But at least, in some ways, we took control of our participation, redefined the terms of it.
We never managed to extricate ourselves from the trap — I don’t think we even tried. Subversion, maybe, if not destruction.
***
I stumble back into my room at 2 a.m. Plop down at my desk and look in the mirror, except it doesn’t quite congratulate me this time — smudged eyeliner, lips back to pale pink, sweaty hair sticking to my forehead. It’s the price to pay for a fun Friday night, though, and I’m used to it. This ephemeral masterpiece that I create each week, both motivated and ruined by hours of scrutinized movements and too-close quarters.
Most nights, this is when I reach for a makeup wipe and erase it all, turn the canvas back to its natural state. Maybe tonight, I grab my phone instead. I take a picture, angling my face just right, so the light of my desk lamp obscures the smudging. I add a caption, send it over Snapchat, throw the phone on my bed, immediately retrieve it. Open the app again, involuntarily refreshing. Waiting for a response.
I stay up too late, waiting, and don’t remember falling asleep. When I wake up the next morning, there’s mascara on my pillowcase.

Leslie S. Jamison '04 is an essayist and novelist who directs the nonfiction writing concentration at Columbia University School of the Arts. Jamison visited Harvard on Oct. 1 while on tour for her newest essay collection, “Make It Scream, Make It Burn. ” In between introducing her baby daughter to her undergraduate house (Pforzheimer) and discussing her essay collection with English Professor James Wood before a crowd in Fong Auditorium, Jamison spoke with FM in the Barker Center courtyard. 
​​​​​​
FM: What is it like to revisit Harvard now, when you've revisited it so many times in your writing?
LSJ: Coming here, it was like that thrilling and terrifying threshold moment of self-making, and I think there was a kind of deferral, of never quite feeling at home in my world when I was a child or a teenager, and thinking, maybe when I'm embarking on life on my own then this project of inhabiting myself will happen. Then inevitably, when you finally hit the horizon that you've been aching toward, there's this terror. Because here you are, and what will happen now? I think that's part of why I felt such a sense of being lost when I was first here, and that really keen sense of needing to prove myself and feeling constantly like I was falling short — which I think Harvard as a place can certainly produce in people — but it was almost this feeling that I'd carried around with me all my life, that Harvard then managed to put an official language or structure around. In order to exist, you need to prove you're good enough to exist.
I really struggled with that. It's less that I feel like I found myself here, and more that I feel I found relationships and community, which is maybe a way of saying that that is where my sense of self ultimately resides. And maybe that's part of why I keep coming back to it, is trying to make sense of what parts of myself were forged here, and how and why, and what part other people played, and what part drinking played, and what role art played, because all of those felt like they were part of that conversation.
FM: Or, "You've described yourself as a person who once wanted to take up as little space as possible. Do you still feel like that person? When did you start thinking of yourself as a writer and stop thinking of yourself as... a girl?"
LSJ: Well, I was recently having dinner with some friends and we were talking about conversational tics, because I had an ex who wrote a memoir and he called me out for always saying, "I will say," at the beginning of everything.
FM: Aaaaaahhh!
LSJ: It was funny, because he's right! But he read it as if I was declaring that I had something important to say by saying, "I will say." And I realized that I say it all the time almost as a confession of partiality, like, I can't really issue the full or comprehensive take on this thing, but I will say, X. Then I also became, in a paralyzing flood, aware of all my other tics, including the fact that I often say, "It's really interesting that," and then say the thing. Which is really embarrassing because it's as if I'm advertising things I say before I say them, but I really think it comes from insecurity. From some part of me that's still 10 and still feels like I have to raise my hand at the dinner table and say — listen, listen, listen, everybody, I do have something to say. All that to say, it's really interesting that I think I do still often feel afraid of being excessive, of taking up too much space, or wanting too much, or wanting another person too much, or wanting things I can't have; all those various forms of too muchness, which feel like they are continuous with the 17-year-old self who was literally afraid of taking up too much space.
So even though I am drawn to conversion narratives where we transform, and are no longer ourselves — that's a very American story; I think a lot of us are drawn to versions of that story — I do also think we're more like, I don't know, trees, or Russian dolls. I mean, I do totally believe in transformation, I believe in everything Lana Del Ray sings in her album, but we’re also always holding the old selves inside, too. Even though I do feel quite different from that 18-year-old version of self, I still feel that the things that she was afraid of, I'm still afraid of, but sometimes those fears just go by different names. The things she longed for are still the things I long for. And maybe that's the axis upon which I feel most connected to her, still, is the axis of longing, because I feel like a lot of those motivating desires are still the same.
FM: Which are what?
LSJ: Like longing to be loved, basically. And a lot of things are subcategories of that great longing. Wanting to be good enough, and — I don't know if the desire to make great art is wholly about wanting to be loved, but I think it shares something, in the sense of wanting to be heard.

“NO BOYS...THE GIRLS RUN IT,” declared a graffiti message streaked across the outer walls of 888 Memorial Drive.
It was March 6, 1971 — two days before International Women’s Day — and the halls of 888 Memorial Drive were brimming with the fervour of students and working-class women from Radcliffe College and the greater Boston area. Today, the building is just another unassuming brutalist structure sitting comfortably on the banks of the Charles River, but in 1971, Cambridge women occupied the space to fight for a community women’s center.
Harvard had owned the 888 Memorial Drive building, formerly the Hingham Knitting Factory, since 1929 and was at the time repurposing it as a home for its Graduate School of Design. To the protestors, however, the building stood as a symbol of Harvard's failure to listen to both its own community’s demands for a women’s center and the surrounding neighboring Riverside community’s need for affordable public housing.
Bread and Roses, a women’s resistance organization responsible for the takeover, strategically chose this underutilized Harvard building located in Riverside for their ten-day protest, scheduled from March 6 to March 16.
The protest began with a march through Boston and ended in Cambridge on the banks of the Charles. Judith E. Smith ’70, electrified by the march, recalls how the marchers called out in solidarity to the women of the Boston Playboy Club and the Charles Street Jail — both of which are now luxury hotels. When the protest reached Cambridge, its organizers announced their intended takeover of the Design School building.
Over the course of the next ten days, they faced admonishment and increasing hostility from Harvard, the media, and the city of Cambridge. Amy C. Brodkey ’71, a Radcliffe student who took part in the building’s occupation, still remembers the fears and pressures that the occupants of 888 faced.
In response to the protest, Harvard turned off the power and the heat in the building, and called the police to the site.
"Walking into the building was frightening,” Brodkey says. She was one of only a handful of Radcliffe students occupying the building; the other protestors included Bread and Roses members, working-class women concerned about the lack of public housing in Cambridge, wives of Harvard professors, and other university students. They would wear scarves around their faces as they went in and out of the building to go to work and school, hiding their identities from the surrounding police officers.
The women sought to show solidarity with the anti-Vietnam protestors, who two years prior had staged a similar operation in their 1969 takeover of University Hall. “Like the Southeast Asian people, and like the people of Cambridge who have already begun to make their demands known, we, as part of the growing community of women have found it necessary to fight for what we need,” a pamphlet from the protest declares. “We are determined to keep our women’s center open.”
The occupation of 888 came at a pivotal moment during the broader women's liberation movement, when women across the world were banding together to make themselves heard. Those at Radcliffe saw the community created at 888 as one that provided an outlet for the opinions they couldn’t express in classes.
Smith notes that “the curriculum at the time did not feature the voices and concerns of women.” Spaces like the occupied building gave freedom to these voices, providing an attentive audience and open arms.
Libby C. Bouvier, who become the resident manager of the new Cambridge Women’s Center the following year, says that although this takeover was painted in broad, degrading terms by the local papers, it was, in fact, a multifaceted and surprisingly successful 10-day occupation.
Ultimately, Harvard called in the state police and filed a court case against the women, forcing them to finally vacate 888 Memorial Drive. However, Susan Story Lyman ’49, a member of the Radcliffe Board of Trustees, donated $5,000 (roughly $30,000 today) to the organizers of the protest, who then built the Cambridge Women’s Center at 46 Pleasant Street, only 10 minutes away from the site of the occupation.
Eventually, 888 Memorial Drive became graduate student housing. Despite this transition though, the building’s history — and the story of the protest it witnessed — remains a testament to the longstanding presence of the women’s liberation movement at Harvard.

You’d be forgiven for thinking you have walked into a Halloween store instead of a ballroom dance competition. There are at least three inflatable dinosaur costumes, two Pikachus, multiple penguins, hippies carrying succulents, and a dizzying amount of sequins — and that’s only what’s visible after a first scan of the fourth-floor gym at the Mac.
After a long day of dancing, we’ve reached the final event: the storied Rookie-Vet dance, where newcomers pair off with experienced dancers to depict whimsical stories with creative choreography and extravagant costumes.
This is the Harvard Beginners Ballroom Dance, one of two major annual competitions hosted by the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team. This is the 21st iteration of the event, drawing participants from Harvard and several nearby colleges, including MIT, Boston University, and Northeastern. As its name suggests, the competition is structured to be friendly to beginner dancers, making it an event that both fosters inclusion for rookies and provides an entertaining opportunity for spectators.
“If you’ve never competed or been to a ballroom competition, you might find it odd,” says Alida B. Monaco ’21, president of the HBDT. “It’s like a nuclear bomb of glitter, music, dance, and sweat.”
It takes only a few minutes to confirm that Monaco’s summary of the event is accurate. In a moment, the dance floor is filled with couples twirling like off-kilter spinning tops, their long, vibrant skirts flouncing up to reveal suede-capped heels in the Viennese waltz. Minutes later, new couples take the floor, decked out in fringe and sparkle, their dresses short and skin-tight. They roll their hips, march purposefully yet delicately, and occasionally thrust a hand into the air, dancing the salsa.
These are just two of the nineteen dances performed over the course of the day. The dancers compete in four categories: Rhythm, Latin, Smooth, and Standard. Each dance has its own distinctive rhythmic pattern, its own prescribed step sequence, and its own particular artistic nuance.
That means that this year’s fifty-four ballroom team rookies have a lot to learn. While a few of this year’s beginners have previous dance experience, none have yet competed in the ballroom style.
According to one of the competition chairs, Veronika Y. Melnik ’21, introducing the rookies to ballroom is a gradual and occasionally difficult process. “First, we teach the differences between the dances: what is smooth versus what is standard. Then, we create a distinction in the techniques between each style.”
The support that the ballroom veterans provide the rookies doesn’t stop at coaching: At the competition, too, the atmosphere is incredibly encouraging. Older dancers from all teams form a ring around the dance floor, brandishing posters, shouting cheers, and offering high-fives.
Monaco summed up the emotion that follows seeing the rookies dance for the first time. “As a team member, you’re like, ‘Oh my God, my babies, they're dancing!’ And [the rookies] are kind of like, ‘are we really doing this right now?’ And then they see that it's really fun.”
Later in the day is the Open Showcase, where more experienced dancers demonstrate each of the 19 dances. It’s a marked contrast to the newcomer events; the couples look like they’re straight out of “Dancing with the Stars” as they quick-step effortlessly around the floor, all smiles. The rookies look on, wide-eyed.
Maranda Ngue ’22, a first time dancer, has been pleasantly surprised to find that the camaraderie on the floor is just a slice of the ballroom experience as a whole. “It’s so welcoming. I’m absolutely going to continue,” she says.
At the Rookie-Vet Dance, the class of newcomers is drawn into the ranks of older generations. The veterans lead their rookie partners onto the dance floor and perform one of four dances, using costumes and choreography to tell a story. The plots range from Ash chasing Pikachu across the dance floor to a kind friend supporting an inebriated party-goer — complete with a Red Solo cup in hand.
Telling stories is perhaps something that dancers can do best. As Melnick says, “Dance is a sort of universal language. It’s a bond that brings people together.”

When Deesha A. Dyer — then-Social Secretary for the Obama administration — was hosting singer Aretha Franklin for a 2015 performance at the White House, she was given an unexpected request.
Franklin, feeling cold, insisted that Dyer light a fire in the White House for her. “And I was like, we can’t, you know, burn down the house,” Dyer says. Instead, Dyer turned up all the heaters until the house became uncomfortably hot, noticeable even to the audience members present.
“But then,” Dyer laughs, “when [Franklin] gets on stage, she tells the audience, ‘Whew, it's hot in here!’ And we're like, are you kidding me?”
Dyer, who served as Social Secretary from 2015-2017, has no shortage of stories from her time working in the Obama administration. She was in charge of hosting all the social events at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, ranging from formal state dinners to tea with the First Lady. “Man, it was crazy,” she remembers, a hint of nostalgia in her voice.
Now, Dyer is a Fall 2019 Resident Fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics.
Growing up, Dyer had no idea that she would become a key figure in a presidential administration. She was born in Philadelphia, Penn. and was not from a college-educated family, nor one particularly politically involved. Dyer attended a boarding school for low-income families, and then the University of Cincinnati, where she dropped out before completing her freshman year. College was “just not for [her],” she decided, and she left to pursue odd jobs instead.
At 29, Dyer returned to her studies, this time at the Community College of Philadelphia. In 2007, her first year at college, Barack Obama was beginning to make waves in the Democratic primary. Dyer had never been deeply interested in electoral politics, but Obama’s campaign struck a chord with her passion for activism.
“Barack Obama… introduced me to politics in the sense that I felt like I was a part of politics,'' she says. When he was elected, Dyer felt like the electoral and activist sides of politics seemed to overlap for the first time — so she decided to get more involved in Washington, D.C.
Dyer decided that she wanted to work in Obama’s White House, and applied to be an intern in the Office of Scheduling and Advance in 2009. To her surprise, they picked her.
Dyer says that to succeed in Obama’s White House, interns needed not extensive experience within the gates of power, but instead “a quest to learn… passion for the country… passion for democracy, community service, the passion really for the people.”
“And that's what I had.”
The following year, in 2010, she was hired full-time at the White House. Dyer served the President and First Lady in the Office of Scheduling and Advance until, in 2015, she was selected to be the White House Social Secretary.
As Social Secretary, Dyer was in charge of the White House Social Office, coordinating all the events, and choosing whom to invite. With this power, Dyer worked to expand the representation of marginalized communities in a space typically closed off to them.
“I made sure that I tried to be a bridge as much as I could in those communities,'' she explains. “I made sure that if somebody wanted to come for a tour, somebody wanted to sing at the White House, or somebody wanted to ask a question, they wanted a birthday greeting… that I do whatever possible to make that happen.”
“I didn't want them to feel like the government and the White House were so far away,” she adds.
Dyer says she tried to stay authentic to herself throughout her time at the White House. “When I felt like I wasn't being accountable to [my community], I had to check myself.” At the end of her tenure, she says she “felt like I represented the best of my ability to have lasting change.”
After what she calls the “dismal” 2016 election, she recalls the Obamas reminding their staff that the progress they made was not for nothing.
But despite the close of her tenure at the White House, she knew that it was just the beginning of her career.
She decided to focus on her nonprofit beGirl.world, founded in 2014, which seeks to empower high school girls in Philadelphia through globally focused education and travel. When traveling with the President, Dyer explains, “I wouldn't see any black people in the U.S. embassies — like, ‘kind of awkward, there’s a lot of us back home.’”
Dyer realized that many people may not go on to become foreign diplomats because they lacked “a global perspective of what they can do,” a mindset she resolved to change starting with high school girls.
The excitement and pride is palpable in Dyer’s voice as she talks about how the young women in her program have become more globally aware, with many later studying abroad in college. These students, as well as the students Dyer has met at Harvard, make her more optimistic about the future.
“What gives me hope is that young people are redefining and challenging and succeeding,” she says. “Breaking down walls and then putting them back together.”

Ed A. Macomber strides down the hospital-white halls of Harvard’s Center for Nanoscale Systems, his heavy black work boots barely making a sound. Behind a glass panel to his left, scientists in full-body white suits toil on enormous machines.“I wouldn’t want to have a job where I’d have to sit at a desk all day,” says Macomber, bending slightly at the waist as he stares directly into a glass panel. The system recognizes his iris, and the door to the laboratory unlocks. “It’s just too boring to me.”
Stepping inside the changing room, Macomber pulls a mask over his silver goatee and climbs into a jumpsuit. Macomber specializes in creating very thin films of material, only a handful of atoms thick, used in everything from circuit boards to solar cells. His elaborate costume is not designed to protect people from the experiments, he explains, but to protect the experiments from people. Specks of dust are so large that they can destroy the complex materials that scientists work hard to create. The lab is called a clean room because it is designed to remove as many particles from the air as possible.
Dressed completely in white except for the yellow safety glasses, Macomber walks over to his row of machines. He is the technician in charge of the physical vapor deposition equipment in the clean room, which is used to make the films. PVD machines are so powerful that they can evaporate metal. Scientists deposit this evaporated material on an object of their choice — like dew gathering on leaves in the early morning — creating a substance with new properties, like increased strength or conductivity. Macomber holds up a piece of smoky gray glass, discarded by someone who used his machine, and the light streams through. The titanium film is so thin it’s transparent, like a pair of sunglasses, but the metal keeps the glass safe from wear and scratches.
Macomber has always loved complicated machines. His dad was a mechanic, and Macomber grew up fiddling with engines in the garage. After high school, he bounced between odd jobs and did a combination of technical drawing and mechanical work. Eventually, in his thirties, he enrolled part time at Bristol Community College. One of his professors encouraged him to apply for the National Science Foundation’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, which places students in labs across the country. Macomber wasn’t so sure. “I think she had to remind me at least half a dozen times to [apply],” he says. “In my mind, they want somebody young that has their life ahead of them.”
But Macomber’s unusual skills with all kinds of machines impressed the Harvard disease biophysics group, which jumped at the chance to hire him. “You never know what's gonna happen in this damn life sometimes,” he says with a laugh.
Macomber impressed his labmates, who encouraged him to stay at Harvard and keep up his growing interest in nanotechnology — the disease biophysics group uses tools like PVD to make new medical equipment. For Macomber, the transition was natural. All machines need parts, even fancy ones, and repairing a vacuum pump isn’t all that different from tinkering with cars. Macomber still exercises his skill in fiddling with engines: He has four motorcycles at home, which he keeps running on his own and rides to work almost every day. Always curious, he attended night school for 10 years while working full time at Harvard, eventually earning a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Northeastern.
Macomber’s expertise has helped thousands of scientists over the years — about 500 people at a time are registered on his machines. But of all the projects he has worked on, he is particularly proud of helping a team of scientists pioneer a new way of repairing hearts.
Some people are born with potentially life-threatening holes on the inside wall of their heart. Scientists wanted to repair these holes with less invasive methods than open heart surgery, so a team designed a patch that could be attached to the heart with special glue activated by ultraviolet light. But they needed a way to shine light on the patch so the glue could work. The scientists had an unusual solution: If they could inflate a tiny, shiny balloon, they could reflect light inside the heart and direct it toward the patch. All they needed was someone to layer a tiny bit of metal inside a balloon — just enough to make it reflective, but not so much that it would prevent it from inflating. But balloons are bendy, and PVD normally works with solid, flat objects like glass or silicon. Macomber was able to push the limits of his machines, and he covered the balloons in a very thin layer of aluminum — just what the scientists needed. Their method is posed to radically improve heart treatment.
As Macomber gets ready to leave the clean room, he presses a series of buttons on one of the machines. The front of the machine slowly folds down. In the center, like an old CD rotary, a spinning pallet of six different metals emerges, each ready to be eviscerated by a beam of electrons. Macomber refills the machine with chunks of gold, platinum, and chromium, explaining in detail how each would be useful for scientists and engineers. “I love my job,” Macomber says with a smile. “There’s always something new to learn about.”

Since April, when Pete Buttigieg ‘04 announced he was running for the Democratic Party nomination, I’ve gone out of my way to dislike him. This summer, I would wake up in the morning, make myself a cup of coffee, and read the 750-word cultural commentary about Buttigieg that appeared almost daily on the New Yorker’s website. I read these articles in the same way my mom watches “Real Housewives:” because I loved to hate it.
Most of the articles I read about Buttigieg expressed a giddy, almost crazed adoration for his intellectual past — he speaks Norwegian, loves “Ulysses,” and was a Rhodes Scholar, they like to report. During his time at Oxford, I learned, he never cooked dinner with the other Rhodies but instead did the clean-up afterward — a not-so-subtle allegory for what Buttigieg would do in office after Trump and, perhaps, a commentary on the domestic superpowers of gay men.
A boy I made out with at a party last year told me he was working for Buttigeg’s campaign after graduation. Back at school, I went snooping around The Crimson’s website for articles about Buttigieg, trying to discern what people on campus think about the alum (while keeping a safe six degrees of separation this time). But the only recently published article I could find explained blandly that 14.8 percent of the class of 2019 plans on voting for the man. Nothing much interested me until I discovered something far, far better than articles about Pete Buttgieg: articles by Pete Buttigieg.
During his senior year, Peter P.M. Buttigieg had a column in the very pages of this newspaper. It was entitled “Liberal Art” and ran on alternate Monday’s. The column goes like this: Baby Buttigieg picks some high-brow piece of culture (Yeats, “Henry IV,” a 20th-century Lebanese poet named Khalil Gibran), and relates it to what’s going on in Washington, D.C. He likens “Henry IV” to George W. Bush, with the whole “‘following in his father’s footsteps into positions of power”’ thing. He claims Yeats’s lamentation that “the best lack all convictions, while the worst are full of passionate conviction” maps onto early 2000 partisan warfare. Life imitates art, yadda, yadda, yadda.
Even when Buttigieg picks a non-explicitly political topic, he still finds a way to bring it back to Washington. One of his articles, entitled “Prudes and Puritans,” is about Janet Jackson’s nip slip at the 2004 Super Bowl. Justin Timberlake’s intentions when he grabbed Jackson’s shirt shouldn’t be our focus, he argues. Instead, Bush’s political intentions should. He calls Eminem “an index of our time” and argues that the “rise of angry white rap” is due to, you guessed it, the Bush administration.
At this point, talking about Buttigieg has become my go-to party trick. People love hearing what I, a white gay man at Harvard, think about the white gay Harvard graduate running for office. Corona in hand, I’ve sat on sweaty couches and close read his campaign posters: the millennial yellow background; the chaste navy sweatshirt over the starched button-up; how the poster is emblazoned with not his last name but his first, a reminder that he is coming to us from the potholes and school committee meetings of local government.I’ve rolled my eyes and said, “his queerness is just not my queerness,” referring to the I’m-just-the-same-as-all-of-you ethos that makes him so palatable. Nothing gives me pleasure like disliking Buttigieg.
I expected to reap a similar pleasure from reading Buttigieg’s column — containing as it did information about him when he was my age, at the same school, working for the same paper, concentrating in the same department (History and Literature). But mostly, when I read his column, I was bored. Unlike many articles in The Crimson, it’s hard to make fun of Buttigieg’s. His prose is sophisticated but straightforward, his tone level-headed, likable. And his takes are, well, not that hot: Republicans bad, Democrats good.
In June of 2016, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote an op-ed entitled “The First Gay President?” He writes that “If you went into some laboratory to concoct a perfect Democratic candidate, you’d be hard pressed to improve on Pete Buttigieg.” He then goes onto prove his point: Buttigieg has degrees from Harvard and Oxford, he served in the Navy Reserve, he runs half-marathons and gives TED talks, he worked at McKinsey, he speaks “passable Arabic,” and he won his mayoral campaign with 80 percent of the vote.
But this generated-in-a-laboratory quality that makes Buttigieg so impressive to Bruni is what makes his column such a boring read. Everything in Buttigieg’s articles seems like a collage of stuff he cut and glued together from class and CNN. I want something less innocuous than that. I want to root for the kind of person whose prose is occasionally sloppy, whose opinions aren’t just rigid but also rigorous and sometimes even risky, the type of person who doesn’t need to fall back on Yeats to understand the present day, or who fails to read “Ulysses” because they were doing something other than what was assigned for tomorrow’s class.

In 2008, the Lowell Bells that had sounded across campus since 1930 were swapped out for a nearly identical pair. The exchange was a monumental undertaking, yet few at Harvard noticed it, and even fewer knew the truth behind the swap’s impetus and funding.
The original bells, which came from the Danilov Monastery in Moscow, held deep cultural significance in Russia –– deep enough that an organization founded by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg was willing to pay $10 million to get them back.
Evander L. Price, a resident tutor and the Housing Committee adviser for Lowell House, notes that Vekselberg is one of the primary oligarchs designated as a potential concern in the ‘Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,’” the 2017 law that imposed sanctions on Russian entities and individuals amidst Russia’s continued involvement in wars in Ukraine and Syria and alleged involvement in the 2016 U.S. elections.
To Price, this is an important part of the story because “the bells are a symbol of the relationship between Russia and America broadly, and Lowell House and the Danilov Monastery.’”
“[Vekselberg] was well known for being a patron of old Russian art,” says Gavin B. Moulton ’20, president of the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers. “He had bought all these expensive Faberge eggs that were key artifacts of the Russian Imperial Era.”
The Danilov Monastery bells that arrived at Harvard in 1930 were decorated with religious iconography and traditional Slavic text. However, after the Bolshevik Revolution, most of the remaining bells in Russia were melted down, as the iconography and text that decorated their surfaces was banned by the new Communist government. The bells sitting atop Lowell were some of the few surviving examples of traditional Eastern Orthodox bells.
Not that returning the bells would be any easy feat: together, the bells weigh more than 25 tons, and, according to Price, getting them out of the Lowell Belltower required a partial deconstruction of the tower itself.
“[Vekselberg] had a vested interest in repatriating Russian works of art that were totally considered lost in the previous era,” Moulton says. “He was willing to step up to the plate and pay for it all.”
Harvard accepted the offer, and the exchange started to come to fruition in 2003, when a delegation from Russia arrived at Harvard “preaching a new understanding of the bells,” says Isabelle K. M. DeSisto ’20, vice president of the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers. “That they weren’t just musical instruments, but more than that.”
The restoration of the original bells to Danilov did not entail the removal of bells from Lowell forever. Rather, it was simply an exchange. As the original bells went back home to Russia, a new set of identical bells were cast in Voronezh, fully adorned with the same imagery and Old Church Slavonic present on the originals. The new bells were tuned in a Western fashion, allowing them to play harmonic melodies with different notes instead of layered chimes.
Now, there exist two sets of Danilov bells: the original, “Eastern-tuned” set in Russia, and the recast “Western” set here at Harvard. The Harvard bells have their own Facebook and Google+ pages, and they retain their presence in Lowell community lore.
“We go over the history [of the bells] often at Lowell orientation events,” Price says. “The bell ringers are all well-versed in this history. I suppose other houses probably don't know as much about them — but I'd challenge you to find me a more idiosyncratic example of Harvard history.”
The bells in Russia continue to hang at the Danilov Monastery to this day, but Harvard has made its mark; on the original set remain the engraved and graffitied names of visitors past, an etched record of the bells’ 78 years spent atop a college dorm. In a sense, this segment of the bells’ history live on, even with their return to Russia. The Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers even makes summer trips to the Danilov Monastery via an exchange program, in which Harvard students have the opportunity to play the bells that used to be just a brief walk away.
“The history of the bells is far from over,” Price says. “And it is a history that is only going to get weirder. But no matter what happens, Lowell will be bellin' on Sundays.”
Correction: Nov. 21, 2019
A previous version of this article misspelled the name of the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers.
Correction: Nov. 21, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Viktor Vekselberg paid $10 million to get the original bells back. In fact, an organization he founded paid the $10 million.

On rare occasions, a flash of the forceful energy that animated Arthur M. Sackler would break through the modesty of his carefully cultivated public facade.
One such instance was the dedication ceremony for the Harvard museum that he had helped fund.
“A new millennium begins in but a decade and a half,” he declared to a crowded Sanders Theatre on Oct. 18, 1985. “After billions of years and myriads of species, a newcomer, homo sapiens, in just twoscore years, has traversed a range of global watersheds, completely reversing realities that ruled throughout the existence of our earth.”
“For the first time in four billion years wherin all species were at the mercy of the environment, that environment is now at the mercy of one species,” he continued. (He would repeat the refrain of “For the first time in four billion years” seven more times in his speech.) Standing alone at his podium, Sackler went on to assert with sweeping grandeur that scientific progress had solidified mankind’s supremacy over nature and “thwarted the inevitability of death from heart, kidney, or liver failure;” that technology had dispelled “fertility cults;” unseated religious zealotry; and advanced to the point at which it could guarantee the basic needs of all humankind in perpetuity. A new age had dawned for Arthur Sackler, and with it, limitless possibility.
If his unshaken faith in scientific progress felt misplaced at the inauguration of an art museum, none in attendance recorded their bewilderment.
Sackler, who had never attended Harvard, was relatively unknown to most at the University until the 1980s. With the exception of major donations like his gift to the Harvard Art Museums, he typically maintained a quiet public presence. While recognized among circles of art collectors, he avoided museum boards and art functions and typically declined interviews.
When the Arthur M. Sackler Museum opened its doors in October 1985, a special supplemental issue of The Crimson declared the occasion “The Miracle on Quincy Street.” The Fine Arts Department had for years been cash-strapped and space-poor, forced to convert supply closets and exhibition galleries into offices for its new faculty members. With the opening of the Sackler Museum, the department gained office spaces, classrooms, and galleries for its expansive collection of Asian and Islamic art, which had long languished in storerooms and basements.
But in the years leading up to its opening, the Sackler Museum was criticized for fundraising targets deemed too ambitious in the age of stagflation and passionately opposed by Cambridge residents. At one point, the entire project was cancelled by Harvard President Derek C. Bok. Deeming it a miracle when the museum’s doors opened in 1985 was hardly hyperbole.
Few could have anticipated, however, that the museum would again become embroiled in controversy three decades later, this time for an entirely different reason: The Sackler family’s connection with Purdue Pharma, the pharmaceutical company best known for producing OxyContin, a time-release painkiller widely implicated for its role in the opioid epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 47,600 people in the United States died of opioid overdoses in 2017, or on average 130 each day. Activists and academics alike have pointed to Purdue Pharma’s aggressive marketing strategies — which downplayed the addictive potential of OxyContin — as one of the epidemic’s principle drivers.
The Sacklers had for decades funded art museums, medical schools, and a myriad of other charitable endeavors. But as the opioid epidemic received more and more attention, protesters across the United States and around the world called for the Sackler name to be stripped from many of the gilded institutions it adorns — from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, to the Smithsonian in Washington, to the Louvre in Paris.
Before long, the swell reached Quincy Street. Over the past two years, demonstrators have staged several protests outside of the museum calling for the University to remove the Sackler name and refuse future donations from the family. While spearheaded by Team Sharing, a support and activism group for individuals who have lost loved ones to the opioid epidemic, the protests have attracted a diverse array of supporters, including such political figures as Somerville Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Arthur Sackler’s defenders, however, have attempted to distance him from his younger brothers Mortimer and Raymond, who co-owned Purdue Pharma. In an op-ed in The Washington Post, Jillian Sackler, Arthur’s third wife, pushed back against the activists, highlighting that her husband had died nearly a decade before OxyContin came to market. After referencing “legal and contractual considerations,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow echoed similar rhetoric in defending his rejection of the protestors’ demands.
Activists fired back nonetheless, arguing that the aggressive marketing that led to the widespread distribution of OxyContin traces its roots to strategies pioneered by Arthur Sackler.
Sackler thus remains a difficult figure to pin down. His museum dedication speech highlights a contrast between the low-profile public persona he maintained while alive and the zealous energy that undergirded it — and his philanthropic and professional lives were divided in much the same way. Though the museum he funded on Quincy Street, the “miracle” that affirmed Harvard’s commitment to fine arts education, was erected to honor Arthur Sackler’s patronage of the arts during his lifetime, it has become to many a symbol of the forceful pharmaceutical advertising now implicated in thousands of overdose deaths.
When Seymour Slive was appointed as acting director of the Harvard Art Museums in 1974, he hardly expected his tenure to last.
Slive, then 56, was a fine arts professor and expert on Dutch paintings. He had had no formal experience managing a museum with a collection as large as Harvard’s, and in assuming the position, he was met with a steep learning curve. “The problems that face us are enormous: a critical shortage of space, desperately overworked and underpaid staff, continuing risks to the collection from crime and urban pollution,” he wrote in the 1974-1975 “Report of the President of Harvard College and Reports of the Departments,” a document written annually to the board of overseers. “All of these are compounded by a dearth of funds of grave proportions,” he continued.
Slive soon grew into his position: The next year, he announced a $15.5 million capital campaign that aimed to address the problems he had diagnosed.
His goals blossomed further when the University closed the Allston Burr lecture hall, made irrelevant by the construction of the new Science Center. Perhaps, Slive proposed, the structure could become a new space for the art museums.
Two years later, the director first reported the curiosity of a significant benefactor. “As this report is written, I am pleased to be able to say that a major donor has indicated an interest in underwriting a substantial portion of the costs of the new structure,” he recorded in the report for the 1977-78 academic year. Though he would remain anonymous for several years, that donor was Arthur Sackler.
​​​​​​
In January 1979, Slive secured a $10.7 million donation from his new benefactor, the largest gift the art museums had ever received.
Sackler’s money granted him influence over Slive’s vision. “Not long after the drive began, its thrust was radically changed by the appearance on the scene of a new friend of the Fogg,” Slive wrote in a resignation letter to his colleagues in 1981. “He chooses to remain anonymous, and we of course respect his wish. I trust, however, that one day our friend, whose vision is much larger and [more] daring than ours, will allow his name to be made known.”
Sackler, Slive’s “new friend,” encouraged the director to expand his project’s scope. “He suggested: think big. Why renovate Allston Burr?” Slive recollected in his letter. “It does not begin to meet the Fogg’s needs,” he continued. “If it is razed instead of renovated and if its adjacent frame house is razed, a new, threefold larger museum can be built on this site.”
Slive destroyed all of his private correspondence with Arthur Sackler, but the two men left behind a jointly constructed legacy: the third of Harvard’s art museums, home to the University’s collection of works from Asia, the Middle East, and India.
The museum’s focus was of particular relevance to its benefactor. Sackler was an avid collector of Asian art, and he funded the construction of the Arthur M. Sackler Museum for Asian Art at the Smithsonian, even donating 1,000 works from his private collection.
As waves of ethnic studies activism swept across the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, the construction of the Sackler Museum allowed the University to exhume much of its collection of non-western art from basements and storerooms — just as it received more attention from academics. In one sign of the times, Priscilla S. Hunt, an attendee of the Sackler Museum dedication ceremony, annotated the commemorative booklet she received at the event, crossing out every instance of the word “oriental” and writing in “Asian!” along the margins as if to chide Seymour Slive, who had authored much of the pamphlet, for his outdated terminology.
In that way, the Sackler Museum helped realize the University’s goals for arts education. “There’s a huge amount of ways that [Asian, Islamic, and Indian art] contributes to the teaching at Harvard,” says Amy Brauer, current curator of the collection for the Division of Asian and Mediterranean Art — the collections the Sackler Museum was built to exhibit. “We feel like we have a responsibility to present as much of a representation of global art as we can,” she continued. “It presents an incomplete picture to the public to not present those cultures — especially when you’re purporting to present world culture.”
But when asked if she had any personal qualms with Sackler’s connections to the opioid epidemic, Brauer deferred comment to the Harvard Art Museum’s public relations team.
“Dr. Arthur M. Sackler generously donated funds in 1982 that contributed to the construction of the original building that housed the Arthur M. Sackler Museum,” clarified Daron J. Manoogian, director of communications for the museums, in an emailed statement. “Dr. Sackler died in 1987, before OxyContin was developed and marketed. Given these circumstances and legal and contractual considerations, Harvard does not have plans to remove Dr. Sackler’s name from the museum.”
Even if he had held misgivings about Arthur Sackler, Seymour Slive was in no position to voice them: The museums he directed survived off of the good will of wealthy benefactors, and without donations from figures like Sackler, the museum network could never realize its teaching mission.
Not long before his death in 1987, Sackler attempted to adopt his adult assistant Miguel A. Benavides. “You don’t have to answer now, but I would like that and it would be good for you too,” Benavides recalled him saying. “In this way, your children will also carry the Sackler name.”
Though he considered Sackler “a mentor and a father figure,” Benavides politely declined the offer to formalize their relationship. “He was sad, but understood I was proud of my father’s name,” he remembered in a 2012 book detailing his former employers art collection. “Yet I am equally proud of my connection to Dr. Sackler and his work.”
Benavides could not be reached for comment on whether his opinions on Sackler have changed in recent years.
Sackler, who had assumed that his family name would have benefited Benavides, likely never anticipated that it would become synonymous with Purdue Pharma.
​​​​​​
That connection, legitimate or not, only developed after his death. The program for the Sackler’s memorial service held in Memorial Church contained only one reference to the pharmaceutical company: A performance by a chamber orchestra from Stamford, Conn., where Purdue Pharma is headquartered.
Jillian Sackler, Arthur’s widow, argued in a previous comment to The Crimson that her husband had “nothing to do with” the opioid crisis.
"It is a gross injustice to connect Arthur to the opioid crisis some 30 years after his death when he had nothing to do with it,” she wrote. “It denies the many important contributions he made working to improve world health and to build cultural bridges between peoples.”
But activists and medical professionals alike have challenged her claim.
In the 1950s, the chemical producer Pfizer contracted the William Douglas McAdams Company, an advertising agency where Arthur Sackler had worked throughout medical school and later purchased, to market Terramycin, its new antibiotic. Under Sackler’s leadership, the company pioneered a series of strategies then unprecedented in the drug market — branding with flashy graphics, free samples, attractive advertisements in medical journals — that, as argued by Doctors Scott H. Podolsky, David Herzberg, and Jeremy A. Greene in the New England Journal of Medicine, created the playbook that his brothers would adapt to great success in the marketing of OxyContin.
The aggressive language of one of the William Douglas McAdams Company’s internal documents — entitled “Easy Prey for Terramycin” — seems to suggest that the prey in question are the doctors prescribing the drug, not the bacteria the drug is designed to combat. And the company was successful: Over the decade that Sackler’s advertising agency worked with Pfizer, the rate at which doctors prescribed antibiotics like Terramycin nearly quintupled.
“No single individual did more to shape the character of medical advertising than the multi-talented Dr. Arthur Sackler,” declared the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame in 1998. “His seminal contribution was bringing the full power of advertising and promotion to pharmaceutical marketing.” Sackler was posthumously inducted two years after OxyContin was first released.
Janet Wooten, a spokesperson for Jillian Sackler, rebukes the claim that the advertising tactics Mortimer and Raymond Sackler used to market OxyContin can be traced to their elder brother Arthur. “Arthur M. Sackler pioneered the first direct-to-physician newsletter, The Medical Tribune, in 1962, at a time when doctors sought news on the many drugs rapidly coming onto the market,” she wrote in an emailed statement. “To say that this form of marketing to doctors spearheaded the opioid crisis is analogous to claiming the mimeograph machine spawned email spam,” she continued. “Arthur did not contribute to the development of opioids; neither he nor his heirs profited from opioids, and none of his philanthropy was derived from opioids.”
Sackler funded the construction of his museum on Harvard’s campus long before OxyContin was developed. But when Mortimer and Raymond debuted the painkiller seven years after his death, it was in part by using many of their brother’s advertising tactics that they were able to market it to such success. In the years following the release of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma funded more than 20,000 pain-related educational programs and donated extensively to the American Pain Society, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the Joint Commission, and even pain patient groups. As a result, each group advocated for more aggressive treatment of pain, typically through the use of opioid pain relievers like OxyContin.
In previous comment to The Crimson, Robert Josephson, Purdue Pharma’s chief director of communications, never explicitly contested his company’s culpability in the opioid epidemic, writing instead that he shared “concern about the prescription and illicit opioid crisis,” was “committed to being part of the solution,” and felt that “more needed to be done.” Facing more than 2,600 federal and state lawsuits, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sept. 15.
As Purdue Pharma’s legacy solidifies, Arthur Sackler’s remains hotly contested.
Though he never lived to see the “new millennium” he so enthusiastically anticipated in 1985, Sackler’s museum survives, currently housing the Department of History of Art and Architecture. From its location on Quincy Street, the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, the “miracle” that affirmed Harvard’s commitment to arts education, has witnessed the fallout of its patron’s dualism, of the contrast between the quiet philanthropist remembered by his widow and the aggressive pharmaceutical advertiser challenged by activists. While battles rage, questions of the museum’s future and its benefactor’s past linger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economic historian Joel Mokyr argued that the expertise of British craftsmen fueled that country’s rise to dominance during the Industrial Revolution in a lecture sponsored by the Economics Department Wednesday.
Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University, attributed Britain’s sudden economic growth to its superior “artisanal elite” — a group of engineers and mechanics whose technical skills gave Britain a competitive advantage over the rest of Europe.
“Britain taught Europe, and Europe taught the world, how the miracles of technological progress, free enterprise, and efficient management can break the shackles of poverty and want,” he said.
Mokyr’s talk — called “The Holy Land of Industrialism: Rethinking the Industrial Revolution” — challenged widely accepted views about the time period. Many historians attribute British dominance in the Industrial Revolution to the country’s scientists, who they argue looked for labor-saving, coal-burning technologies.
Mokyr, by contrast, argued that the driving force behind British growth was the workers who implemented those innovations. He contended that British artisans outstripped their peers on the continent because of the British apprenticeship system. Whereas European craftsmen handed down “codified knowledge” mostly from instructional manuals, the British system passed on “tacit knowledge” from observation, imitation, and in-person teaching.
Mokyr argued that even European contemporaries echoed this idea. He cited as an example British engineer John Farey, who, according to Mokyr, argued that the British did not produce better inventions than other countries but had more effective ways of implementing existing technology.
He said that British advantage launched the nation toward economic fertility because, in addition to the ideas of inventors, countries needed the “mechanical expertise” of “tweakers and implementers” to put new technology into practice.
Audience members said they appreciated Mokyr’s new take on the material.
Mike Andrews, Mokyr’s former graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, said he found Mokyr’s talk engaging.
“Anytime you hear Joel talk, there’s just an avalanche of anecdotes that is just fascinating to hear,” he said.
For David Autor, an economics professor at MIT, the highlight of the talk was Mokyr’s willingness to challenge accepted arguments about the Industrial Revolution.
“Like many things in this area, we can’t really have certainty about them,” he said. “We can’t go back and do a randomized trial to evaluate them. So it’s always a matter of weighing hypotheses and contributing a hypothesis that is fresh and has new implications.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council voted to approve tweaks to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences course schedule — which underwent an overhaul last year — at its biweekly meeting Wednesday, according to council member Kirsten A. Weld.
The changes come as FAS concludes its one-year review of the new schedule, which debuted last fall. FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke presented the proposed changes — which Weld called “little, teeny-weeny, basically textual edits” — to the Council, FAS’s highest governing body.
“These were really very minor amendments that did not change the thrust of any of the already existing policies governing the new schedule,” Weld said.
The Faculty voted to amend its schedule in April 2017 in preparation for the opening of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s new Allston campus. The schedule went into effect for the first time in August 2018.
Under the strictly regimented system, FAS standardized class start and end times; extended the standard course time from 60 to 75 minutes; and eliminated “Harvard Time,” a scheduling quirk that allowed students to arrive seven minutes late to every class.
Though the Allston campus is not slated to open until Fall 2020, the schedule changes were adopted earlier to allow for a two-year trial run of the system. The new schedule staggers the two campuses’ standard class times to provide enough time to travel across the Charles River between Cambridge and Allston. For example, while the Cambridge-based class GENED1034: “Texts in Translation” runs from 3 to 4:15 p.m., the Allston-based GENED1058: “Tech Ethics: AI, Biotech, and the Future of Human Nature” is scheduled from 3:45 to 5 p.m. The similar classes adhere to the standard begin-time of their respective location.
Some students criticized the new schedule shortly after it was implemented because of its incompatibility with lunch hours. The full Faculty voted to adjust the system in December 2018 to ensure students had more time to eat lunch.
Weld said that rather than making new, substantive changes to how the schedule operates, Tuesday’s proposal merely updated existing legislation to reflect changes that came about during the rollout of the schedule, when administrators were “working out a couple of bugs.”
“Until something goes live, you can't actually anticipate all of the potential issues that could come up,” she said.
The Council’s vote is purely advisory, and Wednesday’s proposed changes will not take effect unless they are voted on by the full Faculty later this semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bank of England Governor Mark J. Carney '88 discussed the different ways in which international cooperation can solve global issues at an IOP talk Wednesday evening.
Carney is currently traveling around North America for high-level official meetings with the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund. He will vacate his position at the Bank of England in January 2020, according to Carney.
As part of the annual Albert H. Gordon Lecture series — which focuses on international finance — the event addressed multilateral responses to potential international crises like climate change and financial recessions.
Reflecting on his experiences with global economics, Carney spoke in his lecture about the importance of multilateralism — which Carney used to mean international cooperation — as an “outcomes-based” tool that “tackles specific problems.”
“It has flexible geometry, so it’s different stakeholders for different problems, and it is inclusive,” Carney said.
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers — who was Carney’s economics professor when Carney was an undergraduate at Harvard — moderated the event.
Throughout the talk, Carney said he is optimistic about the future of international cooperation, but also acknowledged that current multilateral reforms need to be improved.
“I’m trying to be glass half-full about multilateralism,” Carney said. “But it’s not the comprehensive multilateralism that reigned up until the great financial crisis.”
Connor P. Chung ’23, who attended the talk, asked Carney about his stance on the controversy surrounding Harvard’s investments in the fossil fuel industry.
In response, Carney said that though divestment is certainly an option, he also believes there are other ways to create positive changes toward a more sustainable future.
“It can be better for the system to put capital into an energy company that is going from oil, coal-heavy, and moving towards a more renewable mix that they wouldn’t otherwise do if they didn’t get the capital and the value,” Carney said.
Marcy M. Murninghan, a strategy adviser for a maritime advising firm based in Boston and a self-proclaimed fan of Carney, said she enjoyed the talk, describing it as “a great overview of the emergence of a multilateral architecture.”
“I came to this because I’m a longtime fan of Mark Carney, and I know what he’s been trying to do for a very long time,” she said.
Though Murninghan said she agrees with many of Carney’s approaches to solving pressing issues around the world, she also emphasized more work needs to be done.
“Multilateralism is great, but it’s like landing in Normandy, I mean it’s just the first of what really are a whole bunch of things that need to happen,” Murninghan said. “So in the context of what he had to say, I thought it was great, but I think it was incomplete.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following Harvard Management Company’s announcement that it returned 6.5 percent on its investments for fiscal year 2019, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he continues to support HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar and the University’s five-year plan to restructure its endowment management.
Narvekar announced a five-year plan to improve the University’s declining endowment returns in January 2017 after he was hired to manage the $40 billion fund. Specifically, Narvekar said he wanted to shift HMC’s strategy to have a more “generalist” approach and require all members of the University’s investment arm to bear responsibility for Harvard’s entire portfolio.
Bacow said he is “confident” in Narvekar’s five-year plan and that the endowment cannot be judged by one year of a low rate of return.
“I think we're on target for where we're going to be, but we'll see,” Bacow said. “Ask me two to three years from now."
The 6.5 percent return is the lowest return rate in two years, as 2017 saw an 8.1 percent return and 2018 yielded a 10.1 percent return.
Harvard has lagged behind other Ivy League institutions in recent years and fell this past fiscal year behind both Brown and Dartmouth — who posted 12.4 percent and 7.5 percent returns, respectively — but posted a higher return than the five other Ivy League universities.
Bacow said the University needs to be patient with Narvekar’s plan and said there are “technical reasons” why changes shouldn’t be made too quickly.
“There are commitments that were made forward, which can't be rolled back, and it takes a while to not only exit from certain investments, but also to move resources into another area,” Bacow said. “You don't want to try and time the market.”
Bacow also said the University is still waiting to hear back from United States Treasury Department with final rules for filing a new excise tax on its investment returns. The tax — passed by Congress in December 2017 — will levy an excise tax on universities with at least 500 tuition-paying students and total assets of at least $500,000 per student.
“We've weighed in and expressed a point of view on their proposed regulations,” Bacow said. “But until we have the final regulations, it's hard to say precisely how it will affect different parts of the University and in different ways.”
Harvard jointly submitted a formal opposition to the tax with more than 30 other colleges and universities to the Treasury Department more than two weeks ago.
“We remain opposed to this damaging and unprecedented tax that will not only reduce resources available to colleges and universities to promote excellence in teaching and to sustain innovative research, but also to increase access for low and moderate-income families through financial aid,” the letter read.
Harvard has the largest endowment of its kind in the world, valued at $40.9 billion. The fund supports many of the University’s operating costs. Roughly one-third of Harvard’s operating budget comes from the endowment each year.
In recent years, the University’s endowment has come under increased scrutiny as student activists have targeted investments like those tied to the fossil fuel industry, private prison companies, and Puerto Rican debt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign released a report Wednesday that estimated the University has at least $3 million invested in companies tied to the prison industry and urged administrators to divest all their endowment holdings from prison-related companies.
In their report, the campaign — launched in 2017 to call for the dismantling of the United States prison system — also called on the University to disclose to Harvard affiliates all endowment holdings in companies connected to the prison industry.
“We have more questions than answers about the 96% of the endowment invested in private holdings; these asset classes are relatively unregulated (compared to public assets) and frustratingly obscure,” the report reads.
HPDC listed certain companies they claim Harvard has invested in that could presumably impact incarcerated individuals. The list includes private prison operators, like CoreCivic and Geo Group, and other businesses that in some way service prisons, including Amazon, Bank of America, and Honeywell International Inc.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that University President Lawrence S. Bacow has met with Harvard affiliates advocating for prison divestment and looks forward to meeting with them again in the future.
“President Bacow has met with advocates for prison divestment. He has also invited them to meet with members of the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and looks forward to further discussion,” Newton wrote.
HPDC is scheduled to meet with Bacow and the Corporation’s Committee on Shareholder Responsibility on Oct. 28, according to HPDC member Paul T. Clarke. The CCSR helps to determine the University’s stance on matters related to social responsibility in its investment decisions.
Clarke said group members pushed to ensure that the meeting with high-level leaders allowed for enough of their members and administrators to attend.
He also noted the group will bring the details of their report to the meeting with Bacow and other members of the Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — to inform the conversation.
“Honestly, we're going into this meeting as optimistic as we've ever been as a campaign,” Clarke said. “We have an expectation that they will actually start to begin the process of divestment.”
The report outlines its own plan for the University to divest from prison-related companies, writing that the University would first approach its fund managers in the Harvard Management Company and instruct them to locate “problematic” investments guided by a list provided by HPDC. Managers would then report to Harvard what those investments are, and then begin the process of divestment, reporting on their progress annually.
“We show how Harvard can and must be the first university to divest fully from the prison-industrial complex,” the report reads.
The report does not provide much guidance for how to disentangle from mutual funds where they cannot dictate screening companies for ties to the prison industry, writing that the University should “make and report on best efforts to find alternative funds/vehicles.” They also propose Harvard should work with similar institutions who want to divest from companies tied to the prison industry.
“Harvard can help convene a market for new pooled products that screen out companies profiting from the prison industrial complex,” the report reads. “This would be a gradual process, but considering Harvard’s position, it would not take very long to embark on the first steps.”
The group also wrote that they want Harvard to reinvest in companies, organizations, or initiatives in Cambridge and Boston that are “directly impacted by the prison-industrial complex.”
“We demand that Harvard disclose and divest, but we also demand that it reinvest in the communities that have borne the burden and violence of incarceration, enslavement, policing and control since the founding of this school in 1636,” the report reads.
Clarke said at least a dozen people contributed an “incredible amount of time and labor” to writing and editing the report starting this past summer.
“We’ve done what Harvard should have done for itself a really long time ago, to really take an accounting of what these investments are,” Clarke said. “It's unfortunate that there isn't a sense of responsibility within the administration to kind of do this work thoroughly.”
“It kind of falls on students to do that, to keep them accountable,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 70 members of the Harvard Band walked out of a banquet celebrating the group’s centennial Saturday after an alumnus joked about the group’s decision to implement a sexual harassment policy.
At the banquet, former band member Richard “Rich” D. Horn ’72 began his speech with a joke about the group’s decision to implement the policy, which undergraduates distributed to alumni ahead of the reunion. As Horn continued to speak, roughly 75 attendees left the room, according to an emailed statement by the band’s senior staff. Many of those who walked out did not return for the remainder of the event.
Horn wrote in an email that he regrets that others interpreted his remarks as a criticism of the policy, which provides band members with a formal disclosure system to report incidences of sexual misconduct, according to a copy of the policy obtained by The Crimson.
“I sympathize with the frustration of decades of Band women in dealing with sexism both in the Band and elsewhere. I strongly support the Band's sexual harassment policy and did not mean to imply otherwise,” he wrote. “I deeply regret any implication to the contrary. This is an issue on which emotions understandably and rightly run high, and I ought to have known better. Hopefully, I will do better in any future occasion.”
A separate speaker had also joked about the sexual harassment policy before Horn, according to the band’s staff. That speaker later apologized for his remarks, the band wrote in its statement.
After some attendees left the room, Harvard Band Foundation president Camaron “Cammie” S. O’Connor Wynn ’94 made an impromptu speech apologizing for the disruption, according to the band. O’Connor Wynn wrote in an email that band leadership, including both undergraduates and alumni, sought to address concerns about Horn’s comments both during and after the banquet.
“Attempts at humor by two brief (not primary) alumni speakers at our 100th reunion banquet touched on the Band’s sexual misconduct policy as a policy — in the sense of the necessity of censoring one’s own speech to fit with the new policy,” O’Connor Wynn wrote.
The Band’s senior staff wrote in an emailed statement that the sexual harassment policy previously caused controversy in the band’s alumni Facebook group when some alumni questioned the need for such a policy. The staff wrote that some alumni had written in the chat that the policy was “in contrast to the spirit of the band that they had known in their time.”
Band manager Lucaian Al-Tariq ’20 sent the emailed statement to The Crimson. Drill master Reese Garcia ’21, student conductor Marcos B. Cecchini ’21, drum major and Crimson multimedia editor Mariah E. D. Dimalaluan ’20, social chair Selket R. Jewett ’21, reunion manager Jessica D. Bishai ’20, and assistant reunion manager Jessica A. Boutchie ’21 also signed the statement.
“[M]uch has changed even within the past decade,” they wrote. “The jokes that were made may express discomfort in confronting this change; older alumni may have been surprised to see just how much the structure and nature of the Band have changed over time.”
“Both their discomfort and the reactions of the undergrads exemplify how deeply all generations of bandies care for this organization, despite its changes,” they added.
The banquet was part of the band’s three-day celebration commemorating its hundredth anniversary. Several hundred alumni gathered on campus for the weekend’s events which, in addition to the banquet, included a performance during Saturday’s football game against Cornell.
Both O’Connor Wynn and the band senior staff wrote that, other than the walkout, the weekend was a positive experience for both alumni and undergraduates. Following the incident, many alumni have affirmed their support for the sexual harassment policy, according to O’Connor Wynn.
“Out of this tension has arisen a desire for more unity and assistance and a willingness to reexamine how the alumni Band should react as traditions change. We have confidence in the strength of our Band family bonds and look forward to continuing to learn and grow together,” she wrote.

We’re in the middle of #spookyseason, and whether you love it or hate it, you have to admit the phrase captures the fall vibes pretty well, for more reasons than just Halloween. Just to spice things up a little, here’s a bunch of things definitely scarier and spookier than Halloween itself.
Midterm Season
Papers and projects and exams, oh my! Enough said.
Not Knowing How to Dress for the Weather
It’s cold in the morning and warm in the afternoon and also seems to rain randomly in the middle? We need help.
Cuffing Season
The most terrifying for the commitment-phobes inside us all. The only boo we want this season is the one on the Halloween decorations.
Concentration Declaration
For all the sophomores — and some very confused juniors — picking your concentration is a frightening step. Even more scary: realizing how many concentration requirements you still have left.
Recruitment Season
Applications, interviews, and some inevitable rejection letters are continuing to roll in this spooky season. With many Harvard students completely unprepared to handle failure, it’s scarier than the typical ghost story.
No End in Sight
The crushing realization that Thanksgiving Break is still over a month away is hitting us. With the long weekend — that was sadly not long enough — behind us, we’re really going to have to hold out to keep up hope.
If you thought spooky season wasn’t scary before, these nightmares before Christmas should be more than enough to keep you up at night.
