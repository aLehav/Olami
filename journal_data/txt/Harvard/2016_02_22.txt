After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like much of Beyoncé’s work, her new song “Formation” straddles the line between social commentary and music. What has been called her ode to blackness is an empowering anthem for a group that has historically been denied the opportunity to tell its story. The song uses evocatively black imagery to bring to the forefront Beyoncé's nuanced position at the nexus of black culture and white mainstream celebrity.
In the music video, Beyoncé is first shown sitting on a floating police car: the embodied form of tensions between police and the black community. And yet, within a few seconds, she is singing about a Givenchy dress. It is this cultural division, not only between affluence and poverty, but also between black and white, that Beyoncé must navigate in order to remain relevant. It is often this very division that has plagued Beyoncé’s image: Not black enough and she risks being seen as a sellout; too black and she risks losing her mainstream appeal.
In “Formation,” Beyoncé skillfully addresses this division—and even scorns its existence. When she sings “Y’all haters corny with that Illuminati mess,” she is expressing her ability to be simultaneously connected to her Southern roots while enjoying her ultra-celebrity status. Indeed, she proudly calls herself a “bama,” reclaiming the now-outdated racial slur which was once used to describe rural blacks. Beyonce also celebrates other aspects of blackness that are often seen as shameful, from afros to “Jackson five nostrils.” Compared to other songs that fetishize black physiques, Beyonce calls upon the cultural heritage that is encapsulated within the black body, giving it new meaning in pop culture.
In this video, the camera is not so much a controlling presence as it is a witness to the undeniable celebration of black culture. Beyonce stages black emancipation not for the white gaze, but in spite of it, a principle she took to new heights during her Superbowl performance. However, one of the reasons “Formation” is a phenomenon is because it capitalizes on Beyonce’s mainstream appeal. She has overcome the vetting process of white America; now she subverts the system with this undeniable proclamation of blackness.
And yet, how political can she truly be? Does she truly understand the struggle inherent in being poor and black? How much can she advocate for the marginalized from her position of privilege? This question of artistic sincerity is unanswerable, and could likely be endlessly debated. What is more important is that the audience listen carefully and respond actively to Beyoncé’s rallying call, afros and black berets included.
In listening to a song that is so inherently political, we as the audience have become complicit in its message. Beyonce is challenging us to give space for black artists to express their own experiences, on their own terms. In this case, the image of the black boy dancing in front of a line of police officers is one of artistic defiance. Absent the space for self-expression, he has carved out a niche for his own voice, an action that is perhaps the most political of all.

In the Chance the Rapper-induced delay of Kanye West’s release of “The Life of Pablo,” his long-teased seventh album, the media focus turned from the album’s bizarre yet utterly Kanye fashion show premiere to his explicit dissing of Taylor Swift. West does not leave any room for interpretation: Toward the beginning of “Famous,” a track that brilliantly features Rihanna’s considerable vocal talents, he raps, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why, I made that bitch famous.” Were “The Life of Pablo” underwhelming, a standard popular rap album, continued focus on this controversial lyric would be entirely justified. Yes, it is undoubtedly sexist; yes, Kanye should be called out for his poor politics; yes, Taylor Swift has risen to the status of a queen of pop based on her own ability and not on the 2009 Grammy controversy. In the face of the prodigious artistry West and his collaborators display on “The Life of Pablo,” however, these concerns become inconsequential. No one less skilled than West could be simultaneously so consummate a megalomaniac and so revered an artist. “The Life of Pablo,” despite its somewhat plagued release, only further establishes West’s resistance to criticism. “Pablo” is a gift, and one shouldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth.
Perhaps it is so difficult to point fingers at West because of the uncanny way in which he pairs the worst moments on “Pablo” with some of the best. West has, for example, crafted an entirely new version of “Facts,” a track that was both musically and lyrically underwhelming when it first came out this past New Year’s Eve. The new version is still somewhat diminished by its entirely vapid lyrics, but the newly included bold beat and almost dissonant synth instrumentation make for a generally good track. “Famous,” which features the offending Taylor Swift lyric, is similar; even taking the misogynistic rhymes into account, it remains one of the album’s highlights. Rihanna’s inclusion on the track is particularly noteworthy: She twice sings snippets from Nina Simone’s “Do What You Gotta Do” with aching emotion and precision. West then wisely ends the track with a snippet of Simone’s own rendition—though this moment is not nearly as powerful as his sampling of Simone on 2013’s “Blood on the Leaves,” it does intriguingly emphasize the verse’s emotional import by spotlighting its interpretation by two very different vocalists. The track also includes a third female vocalist: Sister Nancy, whose “Bam Bam” constitutes almost the entire bridge. On paper, this seems a bizarre choice—the dancehall track that includes few words beyond “bam” does not gel a priori with Rihanna’s hook or West’s rap verses. Yet with a simple beat West knits the components together to create a cohesive track.
This juxtaposition of diverse elements characterizes the album as a whole. Where “Yeezus” was tight, “The Life of Pablo” is fast and loose—it could hardly avoid being so, as its 58 minutes contain 18 tracks, many of which were added at the last minute. That the album still functions as a coherent piece of art is its greatest accomplishment. West referred to an immature version of “Pablo” as “a gospel album with a whole lot of cursing” in an interview with Rolling Stone: While the description is not wrong, per se, it is an inadequate encapsulation of what is ultimately an autobiographical work. “The Life of Pablo” is only “The Life of Pablo” insofar as “Pablo” is West himself. Gospel features prominently and brilliantly on the album simply because West’s Christianity is a core aspect of his life. It is hardly accidental that “Ultralight Beam,” the track that makes the best use of the gospel chorus on the album, begins with, “I’m tryna keep my faith.” And while the track prominently features brilliant contributions from Kelly Price and Chance the Rapper, these inclusions hardly push West into the background: In reference to 2011’s “Otis,” Chance cleverly raps, “I met Kanye West, I’m never going to fail.” Later in the album, in a rare moment of vulnerability, West somehow makes his spectacle of a relationship moving and intimate on “FML,” which here stands for not only “Fuck My Life” but “For My Lady.” In one of the album’s better rap verses, West references his use of antidepressants and describes the highlights and lowlights of his relationship in between hooks movingly performed by The Weeknd. The next track, “Real Friends,” only augments this vulnerability: West’s voice seems to crack as he raps about a cousin who stole his laptop and demanded ransom.
Of course, “Pablo” could not truly encapsulate who West is without featuring his sense of humor, too often neglected in the face of his parodic megalomania. West entertainingly and cleverly instantiates this parody in the middle of the album with “I Love Kanye,” an unadorned rap from the perspective of a fan that ends with “I love you like Kanye loves Kanye.” In the context of the several single-worthy tracks on “Pablo”—among them “30 Hours” and “No More Parties in LA,” as well as “Famous” and “Ultralight Beam”—“I Love Kanye” feels like little more than an entertaining blip. But it is the capacity to create these blips that make West tolerable as a person and hence admirable as an artist. Like West himself, “The Life of Pablo” is a smorgasbord of discrete elements that, incomprehensibly, integrate to make something worthy of praise.

“Wander from the cynical/ Take a look at views atypical”—a couplet from “Hocus Pocus,” the second track on Animal Collective’s new album, is perhaps the best distillation of the AnCo philosophy. Amidst the careerism and millennial anxieties of the 21st century, the band has defined itself by carving out an ever-evolving sonic terrain that foregoes the traditional pop structure for forward-thinking, loose experimentalism. Given this history, the creation story behind “Painting With” seems uncharacteristic of the group. Why pay tribute to the tight structure of the ’70s punk band the Ramones’ eponymous debut? Why record the album in the same studio where Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” and The Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” were made? What is with the baby pool, lit candles, and projected dinosaurs that form the backdrop of the production room? Are Animal Collective committing indie music’s cardinal sin of going pop, or did they lose their mind on another one of those psychedelic camping trips?
The answer is akin to the album: They walk the narrow line between accessibility and madness. Though AnCo has abandoned the melancholia of their poorly dubbed dad rock masterwork “Merriweather Post Pavilion” and the sprawling song structures of “Sung Tongs,” they are far from producing anything that sounds remotely like mainstream pop music. While the songs tend to follow a traditional verse/chorus/verse structure, they contain, among other things, a bizarre news clip about highways being clear of dinosaurs, fuzzy electronica, jazzy bits of piano and saxophone, robotic vocals, and even a tongue-in-cheek sample from “The Golden Girls.” As layered and experimental as the album is, it moves at such a swift pace and has such gorgeous melodies that the chaos of it all does not overwhelm the listener. One is almost compelled to nod along to, the springy, unifying lead single “FloriDada,” which lead vocalist Dave “Avey Tare” Portner described in an interview with Pitchfork as a reaction to “the negativity and separatist attitude” that pervade America today.
Other standout tracks include the snappy, jazz-inspired “Lying in the Grass,” a song in which form reflects lyrical content. It is a song about lifting the veil to find hidden nasty truths, and its somber message is coated in euphoric, warm harmonies until it fades to the dissonance of a dying machine. The song “On Delay,”—the title of which seems to be a contradictory pun on the Spanish term “andalé,” hurry up—brings to mind the glimmering synths of The Postal Service’s song “Such Great Heights” and builds into one of AnCo’s most stunning vocal arrangements since “Merriweather Post Pavilion.” “Golden Gal” features yet another dazzling vocal performance by Portner, serving both as an attempt to empathize with an objectified woman and as an expression of Portner’s deep-rooted admiration for her strength. The only lackluster track on the LP is “The Burglars,” which begins as a promising meditation on a childhood fear, yet drowns underneath the song’s overworked production.
But as delightful as the songs on “Painting With” are, they cohere mostly because of their energetic pace and repetitive structures. Thematically, the album is a hodgepodge of ideas, which is perhaps to be expected for AnCo, as their widely praised “Sung Tongs” is reminiscent of the kind of sparse music one would expect bearded twentysomethings to produce while passing around an acoustic guitar, a drum, and a water pipe. Yet “Painting With” as a whole fails to reach the same heights. “Sung Tongs” gave the listener ample time to soak in its transporting acoustic soundscapes; “Painting With” breezes through its beautiful, disjointed harmonies. The experience is certainly enjoyable, but it lacks the powerful thematic resonance of an album like “Merriweather Post Pavilion” or its inspiration, “Pet Sounds.”
The net effect of the album is one of mixed feelings—moments of it are very strong, but on the whole it feels more like an appetizer than a full course meal. Nonetheless, that appetizer is something to marvel over. Enjoy “Painting With” in the bite-sized parts it serves, and the experience will not fail to delight.

The Boston Philharmonic performed Schumann’s “Manfred Overture,” Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto, and Elgar’s Symphony No. 1—a symphony seldom included on orchestral programs outside Britain—for a full Sanders Theatre on Thursday night. Conducted by Benjamin Zander and featuring violinist Jennifer Frautschi, the orchestra offered its audience a mix of well-loved and lesser-known selections from the classical repertoire.
Before each piece Zander offered his own interpretation of the music, illustrated by measures played by the orchestra. “It’s like when you go to an art museum and you can get a recorded guide—someone talking in your ear and telling you about the paintings,” he said of the combination of lecture and performance. Before the Elgar, for instance, he urged the audience to listen closely for subtle patterns and repetitions. “Wait for the moment when the theme returns, hidden on the back-desk violins,” he said. In the short talks, he offered his own conception of each piece’s narrative but urged listeners to be attentive to the ways in which their own bodies and emotions responded to the sound.
Zander described Schumann’s “Manfred Overture,” which premiered in 1852, as a perfect representative of the Romantic movement in music.  “We are thrown into a world of urgency, despair, tension, and passion,” he said. He drew the audience’s attention to the bodies of the musicians, to the agitation with which Schumann’s composition asks them to move. “[Schumann] created a world of extreme darkness,” Zander said. “The music seems to writhe with sorrow.” From the violence of the opening three chords to the melancholy wandering of the strings in the middle section, from the bewildered sadness of the winds to the ominous thrilling of the double basses, the orchestra gave voice to the piece’s turmoil.
With its instantly recognizable opening notes on the solo violin—evocative of both pure grief and absolute tenderness—Mendelssohn’s 1844 concerto remains one of the most widely performed of the classical repertoire. Soloist Jennifer Frautschi ’95, a graduate of both Harvard and the New England Conservatory, received a standing ovation for her rendition of the work. As she bowed to the audience, two hairs scraped off by her vigorous playing hung from the end of her bow, just visible in the air illuminated by the stage lights.
In contrast to the enduring popularity of Mendelssohn’s work, Elgar’s Symphony No. 1, though acclaimed at its premiere in England in 1908, has received only seven performances in Boston since its debut in the city in 1909. “In building this program I started from the Elgar,” Zander said. “It’s a beautiful piece, a powerful piece. It’s asking the big questions: ‘Why are we here? Where are we going?’ There’s a sense of profound struggle, and in the end Elgar gives us triumph and hope, but it’s a success that’s achieved against tremendous odds.”
Zander said that for him, the heart of the symphony is its third movement, the adagio, in which an idyllic, lilting tune emerges on the first violin and seems to lull the other instruments to sleep. “I don’t want to say anything about it. I want to let it speak for itself, let it reach into your soul,” he said before the performance.
Zander explained that he chose the other two pieces for the way in which they framed the Elgar. “Schumann...was Elgar’s favorite composer, the composer he felt closest to. So that made sense,” he said. “The Mendelssohn is the bait to get people in the door. Everyone loves that piece—and of course they do. It’s a beautiful work, a perfect work.”
He added that he sees the three composers as both musically and biographically connected. “Schumann is really looking forward, Mendelssohn is looking backward, and Elgar is looking both backward and forward. Schumann is the leader of the new Romantic movement, and then Mendelssohn is drawing on Bach, on his predecessors,” he said. “Elgar is drawing on that Romantic tradition, but he’s also very modern. And like so many Romantics, he was an outsider. As a Catholic in the England of that time was never completely ‘one of the boys’. He was even left out of an anthology of important English composers published during his lifetime.”
The Boston Philharmonic will perform the program again on Sunday, Feb. 21, in Sanders Theatre.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As if classes weren’t frightening enough, these Harvard classrooms add to the overwhelming fear that any timid freshman might experience on the first day of college. The anxiety brought on by creeping deadlines and growing piles of psets seems to be amplified once you step into any of the following rooms.
Barker Center 114: Kresge Foundation Room
The Kresge Foundation Room has many great qualities. Blue velvet chairs welcome newcomers as they take seats at a long, oval, wooden table. A grandfather clock ticks quietly in the corner. Large windows bring in much-needed sunlight.
But the one thing that jumps out at people as they walk into the room is the massive stone-gray fireplace that looks like it could set all of Barker Center on fire if it wanted to. Remember that Halloween movie “Monster House” from when you were a kid? The one where a spooky house comes to life and eats children? That’s where this fireplace belongs. It looms over even the tallest kid in section, juts out from the wall, and looks suspiciously like a giant mouth.
Sanders Theatre
Familiar to CS50 students, Sanders Theatre can seat up to 1,000 people and is a member of the League of Historic American Theatres. If that title isn’t intimidating enough, check out the white stone statues on the sides of the stage. The figures of John Otis and Josiah Quincy, sculpted by Thomas Crawford and William Wetmore Storey, respectively, give students stern looks as if they know about the unfinished psets stuffed in their backpacks. “Have you finished the reading?” Quincy might ask as he stares down anyone foolish enough to sit in the front. “Doubt it,” Otis’s folded arms seem to say.
The solution? Sit in the back. Or don’t go to class at all. The lectures are all online anyway, right?
Science Center: Halls A through D
The Science Center halls are an aesthetic nightmare. While Barker 114 might bring back horrible childhood memories, the Science Center halls will make you recall those elementary school finger-painting days, when random colors were splashed onto a canvas and then hung on the fridge as “art.” Why are the seats and walls green and blue? Are they meant to represent the Earth? Growth and tranquility? Or are they just ugly?

We played Kill, Screw, or Marry to study for APUSH, and I decided that Emilio Aguinaldo was the prettiest man on the pages of Brinkley’s thirteenth edition, while someone else said Alexander Hamilton hands down, and another person said Toussaint L’Ouverture no question. We put them against each other. Feeling especially liberal, we decided Hamilton had too much glory to live, L’Ouverture actually got things done, and we were giving an Asian man some sort of chance to get with a girl, which was pretty good, given he was the only Asian man in Brinkley’s thirteenth edition that wasn’t Mao Zedong or a railroad worker. We shook on it and kept going. At that point, invisibility was slightly annoying but not vital, and even if I felt happy seeing an old Asian face on the pages of a history textbook, I didn’t think too much about the fact there weren’t more. Being invisible wasn’t from the kind of racism that killed. It was better than getting Rodney King’d in the head by the police.
But once I asked a yellow-American friend if she’d march in a Black Lives Matter protest, and she hesitated before saying no, she wouldn’t. I got mad and waxed colored solidarity like no one’s business because she let me. I told her we weren’t just talking about stupid representations in media or taking too many AP classes, we were talking about lives, blood on the street, and a system built to hurt or criminalize, which was the system of white supremacy, which was the same system that made sure Jet Li never kissed Juliet, our SAT scores were mad high, and that we were still asking if we were Asian or if we were American. She said it was cute I carried around a Helen Zia book and could spit Tumblr back to her, but I didn’t get it, none of the un-cute, scary stuff. Because even if my parents were yellow, immigrants even, they didn’t look at the Red Apple Boycott in Brooklyn with Robert Carson saying “in the future there’ll be funerals not boycotts” and become completely afraid, like her parents did. They didn’t own beauty shops and restaurants. They didn’t know how to use guns, because I never had to see someone break into my parent’s store and hold a gun up to my father’s head. Or to learn, after a decade, that no one would trust them if they had protested, at least not with their accents, at least not with their children looking effortlessly, happily successful. But she did.
I know there is no way for yellow people in the black-and-white United States to claim a real, dangerous, deadly kind of oppression without sounding overdramatic and historically insensitive, and maybe that is fair. But even if Asian Americans were not enslaved or lynched by the Ku Klux Klan or systematically killed by police officers, they were still afraid. People still died in scary disproportion with someone pointing to the color of their skin. Isn’t that substantive? Isn’t that life or death?
To see yellow in America is to re-understand racial realities not through the simple oppressed-oppressor lens but through something more multi-faceted. Because someone can be both oppressed and an oppressor. And just because you feel the same hopelessness and immobility as others, you may not have an easy time empathizing with them. Because as a minority, doing your own thing, running your own store, working hard, and playing by the rules might never be enough. Like photography, adding color to the picture makes things complicated. But it also makes a picture more real, flesh-like, close enough to touch.
But I also think that being undefined in a binary doesn’t have to be that dramatic. It isn’t always life or death. Sometimes it’s just about feeling good, this gut reaction to knowing, really knowing, with everything you are or thought you could be, that you are actually living.
I guess at one point I was frustrated that no one else got it. That not only was it unpleasant, but it was boring, to talk about Chinese food like it was a metaphor for existence, to somehow incorporate Hubei and oxtail soup whenever writing about “my race,” to talk speeches about Japanese internment camps when I was not emotionally mature enough, to get all symbolic with a dragon named Pete, to get angry at the word chink. Which was why, I reasoned in tenth grade, all of the characters I wrote were unapologetically and stupidly white. Somewhere along the line, I, along with the rest of yellow America it seemed, had convinced myself that yellow characters were incapable of experiences that didn’t conclude in the predictable “I’m not Asian, I’m not American, I’m neither,” or even more infuriatingly, “I’m both!!!” It was like we were incapable of anything other than undefinition and insecurity. It was like we hated being marginalized, but once we had the ability to talk for ourselves, we didn’t know how not to be marginalized. It was the difference, as Toni Morrison has pointed out multiple times, between getting freed and being free. I was frustrated, so I tried my hand at one, a Chinese-American girl named Lucy, and I couldn’t believe how boring she was too.
When it’s not deadly, it’s boring to be undefined. Because blurring lines may only be interesting if the lines are there to begin with. If you don’t know who you are, you can’t act, and there’s no consistency in your actions to make them mean something. Truthfully, most people I know live like stars. They feel themselves in a way that humbles. They have worlds in their heads. But sometimes if you point a gun to a throat, only a sliver will come out. Sometimes the box of language is too small to express what you think. And if you have a pretty formula laid in front of you, it’s hard to kill the box and remember the yellow sun.
I am searching for words, the perfect ones that kick me in the stomach. I’ll roll a couple pretty ones, mine and not mine. Bare feet kissing the ground. Hardwood floor like skin. When you fall in love with a city it is forever and it is like forever. You can be nothing and still breathing. You can be a not-breathing something. And the kind you need a context for, like the last line of Pulp Fiction. Or last March when I thought I finished writing my best story ever and told my sister that life is meaningless unless you have the language for it. I keep trying to think of the perfect words to describe my yellowness but I can’t. Nothing kicks me more than life. Life is a cop-out metaphor, but at one point, I’ll have to admit defeat. I guess it’s natural. I guess I haven’t known life or yellow, yellow or life, any other way. But here it goes. My life is yellow, yellow as the sun, and I can’t tell you how good it feels resting in my skin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, one of Harvard Law School’s major corporate sponsors found itself embroiled in controversy when Milbank, a New York-based corporate law firm, asked that the $200,000 it gives annually for student activities at Harvard Law School be reallocated to other areas. The request came after Justice for Palestine, a student group, used funds contributed by the firm to sponsor an event titled, “The Palestine Exception to Free Speech: A Movement Under Attack.” The event’s organizers put Milbank’s name on their promotional materials, a stipulation of the funding. After receiving complaints from pro-Israel watchdog organization NGO Monitor, however, Milbank first disassociated itself from the event and ultimately decided to discontinue its funding for all student events at the Law School.
This unfortunate incident shines a spotlight on Harvard’s institutional reliance on large donations from corporations and wealthy individuals. Undoubtedly, private money has been and remains essential to Harvard’s success. But every institution of higher education—including Harvard—should be careful about accepting funds with strings attached.
The Milbank case exemplifies the disruption that can result when corporate contributors become dissatisfied. In 2012, the law firm pledged to give Harvard Law School $200,000 per year over five years. Under the terms of the donation, the Dean of Students would allocate the funds to student groups, provided that the groups’ event materials recognize Milbank’s contribution.
Since Milbank pulled its funding, the Law School’s Dean of Students’ office has stepped in to plug the gap—but some student groups are still concerned that they may receive reduced funding. At least one student law practice group not eligible for the newly created Dean of Students fund might not receive any money at all.
Despite these as yet unresolved issues, the Law School deserves credit for its handling of the fallout from the Milbank controversy. Dean Minow’s response—to move around school funds so that donor preferences would not have the effect of stifling student speech—was timely and admirable, and should serve as a model for administrators facing similar situations in the future.
As it moves beyond the Milbank episode, however, we hope that Harvard makes clear to prospective donors that a gift cannot have the effect of undercutting student expression or pushing a political agenda. We understand that Harvard solicits contributions from outside sources out of a sense of duty to its students, and that these sources can help support key aspects of student life. But first and foremost, Harvard has a responsibility to foster an environment of free inquiry and free expression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We fear what they can do to us, yet we cannot forget to fear what we can do to them. This statement isn’t about migrants or competing countries, but about something far more mundane: mosquitoes, the transmitters of the Zika virus and many other diseases.
The recent outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas, coming on the heels of the Ebola crisis, has once more generated fears of pandemic. Symptoms include fever and headaches, but the real scare-factor relates to a possible link between the virus and spiking numbers of infant microcephaly cases, a situation where the brain and head fail to develop normally. This potential threat to the next generation sparks an almost primal fear.
Consequently, the threat has people scrambling for solutions from all avenues, from prevention tactics to vaccine creation. However, as the disease is spread through mosquitoes, specifically Aedes mosquitoes, a simple question emerges, as posed rhetorically by a BBC article: “Would it just be simpler to make an entire species of disease-carrying mosquito extinct?” Indeed, the eradication of certain types of mosquito appears to be a clear-cut solution to the problem of both the Zika virus and the multitude of other diseases spread by mosquitoes. No more would we irritably swat at a mosquito that has just bitten us on a hot summer day, wishing, if only momentarily, that those pesky mosquitoes didn’t exist anymore.
Nor is the possibility of mosquito-cide impossible or even implausible. In one approach, scientists have managed to genetically modify male mosquitoes to become sterile, leading to massive reductions of over ninety percent in mosquito test populations. Combined with other traditional anti-mosquito procedures, it’s reasonable to assume that complete eradication, or at least significant culling, is possible.
Of course, exterminating an entire species raises complicated questions, from environmental consequences to moral implications. What would fill, or not fill, the mosquitoes’ niche in the ecosystem? What harms would come back to us? Some weigh different costs and benefits. Others might fall back on morality.
Either way, we must keep in mind where and how we stand in the world. With thoughts on mosquito eradication ranging from cost-benefit analysis of human suffering and mosquito biodiversity to our offhand musings upon the seemingly endless annoyance caused by these insects, it is sobering to realize the power we wield. We have the ability to end entire species, whether that might come about through serious contemplation or momentary whims of aggravation. In our quest to better understand and thus adapt to the world, we’ve acquired the capability to make the world adapt to us.
And we should be scared, or at least mindful, of those capabilities. In the moment, this consideration has been brought on by the litany of diseases, especially infant microcephaly, that have created misery for so many people. It’s easy to frame the choice within cost-benefit analysis or as an episode in the bigger framework of medicine and humanity’s pursuit of health. But where and when does the rejection of inconvenience end? Of course, the virus is hardly only an inconvenience to afflicted mothers and children, but the point still stands. Much of progress is precisely about rejecting things that hinder or displease us, whether we point to the invention of hunting tools millennia ago or the air conditioner’s arrival in the past century. As we become ever more capable, should we continue to reject everything that inconveniences us in the name of progress? How small can the problem become; what if microcephaly was simply a cold instead?
In the end, it’s a slippery slope and a treacherous precipice. Inconveniences will continue to come; we will never find everything to our liking. Shall we continue to press forward against our inconveniences, as our forebears did through the challenges of forming the first societies, as imperial rulers pushed through the resistance of colonial peoples, and as we today push through the obstacles of nature? We must reconcile the power that we wield with the aims we seek in our attempts to master, and harmonize with, the world. Today, we discuss mosquitoes,  but as we continue to move forward, these discussions could easily become about the environment and the world itself or even one another. We must strive not to reject the world so that it rejects us in turn.
We must act to help those affected by the Zika virus, perhaps through aid and vaccine assistance. We have to determine where we draw the line in either shaping or accepting the world. We cannot forget, whether in our idle grousing about a bug bite, a conference room, or a top-end laboratory, what we can do and what that entails. It’s mosquitoes today; what will it be tomorrow?

The idea of traveling to a random European country and surviving by trading Red Bulls for favors might seem “crazy” to some. For Masahiro L. Kusunoki ’17 and his friends Yuta Shinohara and Yamato Aoki, crazy's just fine.
Kusunoki and his team hope to be among the 165 teams selected to travel around Europe to participate in the 2016 “Red Bull Can You Make It” Challenge. Challengers get dropped off at a random location—with no supplies other than 24 cans of Red Bull to use as currency—and must travel to another European location within seven days.
If a team encounters trouble, Red Bull sends out an emergency team to rescue them. “[We're] not thinking too much about that,” says Kusunoki. “We can make it. That’s our motto.” 
To compete in the challenge, aspiring teams must post a video online and garner support. The video that Aoki, Kusonoki, and Shinohara made is, as of Monday night, the most popular video in Japan, with almost 3,350 votes. Among their supporters are famous writers, athletes, and politicians, according to Kusunoki.
The video opens with the introduction of the team members—Kusunoki, “Magician,” Shinohara, “Earth Boy,” and Aoki, “The Samurai.”
Kusunoki and his teammates first heard about the program in December while he was in Japan, and decided to film on short notice. They recruited a friend with experience as a videographer and finished in three hours. 
If chosen, the team will miss a week of school in mid-April. But Kusunoki is not concerned. “I love Harvard, but there is a world outside of Harvard that you sometimes don’t appreciate enough,”  he says. “It would be nice to take some time off and do something that I would never be able to do otherwise.”
Still,  the group hasn't made it to Europe just yet. Aoki's still recovering from an injury, and may not finish his rehabilitation by spring. The team decided to continue with the application anyway because, at the very least, it would give Aoki something to look forward to.
“If we can’t do the actual competition, we might as well still do the qualifying round.”
Kusunoki and his team remain hopeful that they will pass the qualifying round and travel to Europe come April.
“We can make it,” Kusunoki nods. “We can make it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the water crisis in Flint, Mich. continues to garner national attention, a panel of scientists and policymakers at a Harvard School of Public Health forum stressed that the prevalence of toxins remains a nation-wide problem that should be regulated.
Friday's event, “Chemical Exposures and the Brain: The Flint Water Crisis and More,” is part of the School’s webcast series on controversial health issues in America.
The forum focused on the ongoing emergency in Flint as a starting point to discuss issues with toxins nationwide. The city’s water supplies exposed thousands of children to harmful lead levels which were at times 10 times higher than the maximum allowed concentration by federal regulations.
Tufts University Medical School Professor Jeffrey Griffiths criticized the Michigan government’s failure to maintain safe water supplies.
“This is just negligence at an astounding degree because we knew for decades… that we had a real problem with lead,” he said.
Griffiths also noted the detrimental effects of lead on fetal development, including decreasing I.Q. and increasing incidences of A.D.H.D.
School of Public Health professor Philippe Grandjean said that lead is the “tip of the iceberg,” also using data to show that hundreds of compounds used in daily life can be neurotoxic in humans.
“Any parents or grandparent would agree with me that those 214 compounds have no place in a baby’s circulation or a baby’s brain,” he said.
Because of the widespread usage of these damaging chemicals, panelists called for increased government regulation of neurotoxins.
Marc Weisskopf, an associate professor at the School of Public Health, urged for the implementation of greater safety tests.
“We need to set up, at a much larger policy level, that chemicals need to pass some bar of safety before they’re allowed out there,” he said in an interview.
To that end, Kimberly Gray, a program director in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said the Institute intends to continue research into potentially harmful chemicals. In addition, it plans to collaborate more closely with federal agencies to enact improved public health policies.
Carmen Messerlian, a research fellow at the School of Public Health, said she felt inspired to take a more proactive approach to her research.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost 100 graduate and undergraduate Harvard students participated in the inaugural Kennedy Senate Simulation, a simulation of U.S. Senate activities hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School and the Institute of Politics in Boston Friday.
The Kennedy School students who organized the event began planning for it last September when they noticed HKS had no simulation programs or competitions comparable to those offered at Harvard Law School, according to Michael Thng, one of the event organizers.
During the simulation, which was held at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute—a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public about the Senate and civic engagement—participants considered two pieces of proposed legislation while acting as U.S. senators.
Participants held committee hearings and party caucuses, where they discussed and amended actual bills that were introduced to the Senate in 2015: the Defend America Act and the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.
The day culminated in a much-awaited Senate Floor debate in the Institute’s to-scale representation of the U.S. Senate Chambers. There, the amended bills were put up for separate votes, with only the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 mustering the 51 votes necessary to become law.
Professor Steve J. Jarding, who currently teaches courses in media training and campaign management at the Kennedy School, used his closing remarks to emphasize the importance of learning to compromise as a politician, challenging participants to work together.
Echoing Jarding’s sentiment, many “Republican Senators” said they were proud of the day’s overall bipartisan effort and both sides congratulated each other on enacting at least one of the two bills, despite some disappointment over their failure to pass both.
“It’s very enlightening,” said Arohi Sharma, a Kennedy School graduate student who played the Majority Leader from Kentucky, Republican Mitch McConnell. “It shows the level of compromise needed to pass legislation and the kind of leadership that politicians must embrace to propel change.”
Theodora M. Skeadas ’12, playing the Minority Whip Democrat Dick Durbin, agreed, but also noted that the display of bipartisanship did not necessarily reflect today's reality.
“People voted across the aisle, but the Senators they were representing normally wouldn’t,” Skeadas said. “The good communication between parties occurred because most of us are friends and are mostly one-sided politically.”
Even so, the simulation proved to be educational, participants said. Jarding encouraged the students to view the simulation as preparation for their future potential roles in politics and public policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the recent trend of a growing Greek presence on campus, 280 women signed up for sorority recruitment this year, matching the record large cohort last spring that sought entrance to one of Harvard’s four sorority chapters.
Of those who rushed, 193 received bids, up from 150 bids just two years ago. The number also represents a significant increase from the 150 women that constituted the average rush class size before 2011.
The Cambridge Panhellenic Council,  which consists of representatives from all four of Harvard’s sororities—Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma,organizes recruitment.
“From an organizational perspective, we coordinate the booking of hotels, all the logistical aspects of getting invitations to the potential new members,” Stephanie Ferrarie ’18, Vice President of Recruitment of the Cambridge Panhellenic Council, said. “Particularly for us it’s a lot of organizing and communicating with potential new members.”

Greek life has become increasingly popular on campus in recent years. Unrecognized social clubs like fraternities and sororities, as well as off-campus single-gender final clubs, have experienced intensifying administrative scrutiny over the past year, as Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana pushes for many groups to go co-ed.
Although some new recruits had not considered joining a sorority before arriving at Harvard, participants said they were drawn to alternative ways of meeting new people.
“I actually never thought I would rush in the first place. If I went to college at any other school, I probably wouldn’t have,” Sarah Horne ’19, a new member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, said. “But I felt like I needed another community to surround me at Harvard, like I needed another home base.”
The rush consists of three main rounds—a preliminary round in which all potential new members visit the four sororities and meet with chapter members, a second round in which potential new members rank their preferences and are invited back to up to three sororities, and a third "preference round."
“Basically the whole thing is a mutual selection process,” Horne said. “It’s kind of the way they do Med school, so the higher you put something down, the more they want you.”
At the end of the preference round, potential new members sign the membership recruitment acceptance binding agreement for the chapters to which the commit to accepting a bid from. On bid day, the potential new members receive their invitations to join their new chapters.
Allison Yan ’19, a new member of Delta Gamma, said she enjoyed her rush experience.
“It was really fun. I think I talked to so many girls that I never would have spoken to otherwise, and I would go home with a smile literally sewed onto my face because I’ve been smiling and laughing for so long,” Yan said.
While most women who went through recruitment said they enjoyed the process and appreciated the opportunity to meet new people, the long hours added to the stress of the week.
“Personally, I liked meeting a lot of people, but there were definitely times that I wished I was able to do my homework instead of talking to everyone, just because it takes so many hours,” Leah D. Stewart ’19, a new member of Kappa Alpha Theta, said.
“They basically expect you to prioritize rush over everything else,” Yan said. “They strongly warned against having a conflict… so you can have the highest chance of getting a bid. So that part was a little bit stressful for me, just knowing that I have to go to rush, like I have no time to study.”
Nevertheless, Yan said she thought the benefits of Greek life outweighed the intensity of rush.
“I think the comfort of having a group of friends that you can turn to, and be able to have a social group rather than making friends through p-setting or office hours was a huge appeal,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate student union organizers from Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and the University of Connecticut discussed similarities in unionization efforts across public and private campuses in an event last week at Harvard Law School.
A common theme connecting the speeches was the amount of effort that goes into organizing, namely union card campaigns; members of a group of Harvard graduate students pushing for unionization have continued their push for student signatures.
The speakers from Columbia, Yale, and UConn said they had garnered support for their campaigns from the majority of their graduate student populations.
With regard to organizing at universities with very distinct graduate schools, Ashraf Ahmed, a graduate student at Columbia and a leader of its unionization movement, drew a parallel between Harvard and Columbia.
“Columbia is a highly balkanized place. There are two major campuses, and there are difficulties organizing with places that are miles apart,” Ahmed said.
Aaron T. Bekemeyer, a graduate student involved in the Harvard unionization effort, said Harvard organizers have “walked all over the University,” from the Center for Astrophysics to the Longwood medical campus, in order to drum up support for the movement.
“Part of this was just about creating and strengthening a community that was often difficult to find because people felt like they were isolated by their department or by their program,” Bekemeyer said.
Charles Decker, an organizer for Yale’s graduate student unionization movement, said graduate students there embarked on a photo campaign in the fall of 2014 to prove to administrators that they are committed to the cause.
“Signing a statement saying that ‘yes I want a union’ is a powerful statement. Taking your photo and becoming a public member of this union drive I think is a more powerful statement,” Decker said.
At the event, Law professor Karl E. Klare of Northeastern University provided a legal background, referencing the upcoming decision by the National Labor Relations Board on whether or not graduate students are employees.The event was organized by the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.
“People who are excluded from the definition of employee give every employer in the United States an incentive to escape social responsibility, escape the law, escape union obligations,” Klare said.
While all speakers said they were confident that the NLRB will decide that graduate students are workers, Bekemeyer said the mentality of the unionization effort does not rely on the decision.
“We didn’t need the law to tell us that we’re workers,” Bekemeyer said. “We knew that and have known that in spite of the law.”
Ahmed said that teaching fellows are chief examples of workers. As an undergraduate at Harvard, Ahmed said TFs and teaching assistants were a major part of his College academic life, and their work often extended beyond section.
“If there was a problem set that I was having difficulty with, or if there were particular readings that I was actually interested in and wanted to talk about further, it was my TAs that I turned to,” Ashraf said. “I remember almost every TA I’ve ever had.”
Looking ahead, Bekemeyer said that efforts to organize will continue because an NLRB decision in favor of the HGSU-UAW—the organization is affiliated with the United Auto Workers Unionwould not automatically result in a union.
“It doesn’t happen on its own. While the law both enables and constrains us in certain ways, it’s up to us to act,” Bekemeyer said.
He added that as the youngest unionization campaign on the panel, the HGSU-UAW will continue to look to its peer institutions for guidance.
“In a lot of ways we have looked to the work of those who’ve come before us and are still fighting,” Bekemeyer said. “We’ve been inspired by those grad workers and we’ve learned a lot from what they’ve done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of undergraduates called on Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to increase the accessibility of top administrators and diversify campus artwork at a town hall concluding last week’s Cultural Rhythms festival.
Students and top College administrators, including Khurana, director of the the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations S. Allen Counter, and Assistant Dean of Student Life for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn de la Peña debated current initiatives to increase diversity on campus—a topic that has dominated recent campus dialogue.
Khurana fielded questions from many attendees who called on administrators to hold more frequent office hours or forums similar to Sunday’s town hall. The town hall came about three months after Harvard published a report on diversity that recommended bolstering training among student groups, improve departmental offerings, and promote diversity among the College’s disciplinary bodies. 
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16 said that University President Drew G. Faust should host more office hours. Last semester, Faust held two one-hour sessions, and has two office hours planned this semester.
Suslovic emphasized her desire to bring private conversations—such as those in dining halls—into open and larger venues that could lead to more tangible change. By hosting additional office hours, Suslovic said, administrators can make students’ demands “consistent and continued and public.”
Khurana emphasized that one of his goals as dean is to reduce the “vertical distance” between administrators and students in order to “effect deep meaningful change.”
“I think one of the things we have here is that information doesn't flow as fast as we would like,” Khurana said.
Students at the town hall also called for more visible representation of diversity in campus artwork. At a town hall in December, several students advocated for more diversity in the decor lining Harvard’s walls. The College’s diversity report suggested placing more artwork and portraits to better reflect the diversity of the faculty and students.
Undergraduate Council representative William A. Greenlaw ’17 asked Khurana about progress to the suggested portrait initiative. According to Counter, portraits of several prominent faculty of color have already been added to at least three of the Houses.
Some students criticized what they described as a lack of institutional support for Muslim students, especially in the thick of the 2016 presidential elections.
Anwar Omeish ’19 said many Muslim students on campus felt particularly vulnerable to threats centered around their religion and ethnicity. Khurana described hearing her experience as “anguishing.”
“Hate has no place on our campus,” Khurana said. “I can only imagine how painful it is.”
Students and administrators also discussed the release of a rebranded UC grant that seeks to fund student social activities.
According to UC President Shaiba Rather ’17, the grant is aimed at funding “dynamic” social events that fall outside of regular and budgeted programming, such as last semester's’ Blank Party, a party hosted by women’s advocacy organizations.
Students said they were also concerned about the absence of a multicultural center on Harvard's campus. In response, Khurana said there is a lack of space in Harvard Square and near the Yard for such a center.
“Depending on when you arrived on campus as a student group or organization, some spaces were already occupied,” Khurana said. “We’re trying to make reservations much easier in places like the [Student Organization Center at Hilles], refresh common spaces,... and also make it easier for people to access and make reservations and remove financial barriers.”
The town hall was the first in a series hosted by the Dean’s Office and the Harvard Foundation.

The Undergraduate Council began accepting applications for funding under its new “Grant for an Open Harvard College” on Monday, according to UC President Shaiba Rather ’17.
The grant, which is a reformed version of the Bridging and Belonging Fund created under former UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, was established by Rather and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 earlier this month as an extension of their campaign platform to “Open Harvard.”
The new grant, funded jointly by the UC and the Office of Student Life, allocates $30,000 to students and student groups for initiatives that meet one of the four “compelling interests” that the UC voted on last week: mental health, sexual assault and harassment, race relations, and social spaces.
“Anyone on this campus can apply,” Rather said during the UC’s general meeting Sunday. “We obviously favor collaborative efforts, but whether that’s a blocking group in Mather or a collaboration between HASA and SAA, we’re really looking for innovative initiatives,” referring to the Harvard African Students Association and the Harvard South Asian Association, respectively.

Undergraduates will be able to apply for funding under the grant through the UC website, according to Rather.
“We’re planning on door dropping the entire school with flyers,” Student Relations Committee chair Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 said, describing the committee’s efforts to publicize the new grant.
In its previous form, the Bridging and Belonging Grant was “completely underutilized,” Banks said last week.
“It’s really important that everyone knows about it,” Rather said. “We really want this to be effective.”
While deliberating over this week’s Finance Committee grant pack, multiple representatives raised concerns over the proposed allocation of $877 to TEDxHarvardCollege, a student-run speaker event. Several representatives generally questioned the UC’s policy on funding ticketed events.
Under the Finance Committee’s current policy, ticketed events that receive UC funding must provide “a minimum of 10 tickets to be distributed by lottery for free to the student body.”
In fall 2014, TEDxHarvardCollege requested $3,000 from the UC’s Finance Committee and did not receive any funding.
“I remember speaking out against funding TEDx last semester,” UC representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, said. Levine identified the cost of attending the event as a contributing factor in his decision.
Ultimately, the Council voted against funding TEDxHarvardCollege this week—an atypical move from a body that typically approves grant packs without amendment—with the possibility of re-visiting the funding at a later date.
The Council funded about $7,000 to other student organizations this week, an increase from the past two weeks.
At the meeting, Freshman Class Committee chair Eduardo A. Gonzales ’18 also announced the planned installation of new laundry machines in Matthews Hall in Harvard Yard.
“Something that administrators told us wasn’t feasible has been accomplished by our amazing freshmen,” Gonzalez said. “The Matthews freshman dorm will have laundry machines installed this coming summer. Now, residents of Matthews won’t have to walk across the yard to wash their stuff.”

More than 350 college students, administrators, and alumni from across the country gathered this weekend on Harvard’s campus to celebrate their identities as first-generation college students, representing the culmination of many years of first-generation advocacy at Harvard and other colleges.
The conference, hosted by a group called 1vyG that spans eight college campuses, comes after last year’s first-generation conference held at Brown University.
“Last year the conference gained so much momentum at Brown, receiving national publicity in the New York Times and the Globe, and we were really excited about it,” said Ted White ’17, an organizer of the event. “We wanted to get a shot at not only replicating that at Harvard’s campus, but also symbolize a lot of the work we’ve done here.”

Ana Barros ’16, another event organizer and a leader in the Harvard College First Generation Student Union, said the conference was intended to bring first-generation students together to foster a stronger sense of connection among that group.
“The goal of this conference is one to unify our community,” said Barros. “There’s a need for us to all come together and be surrounded by each other; any community needs that, and especially ours because the first-gen experience is so often an isolating experience.”
The conference included more than a dozen revered academics in areas relating to first-generation experiences, as well as addresses by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. President of the University Drew G. Faust gave a video address to students present.
“Demand integration, not just diversity,” said Stanford professor Prudence L. Carter during an address at the conference. “Inclusion is organizational, not just demographic, change."
Despite addresses given by top administrators, Barros and White emphasized students led the conference.
“For us, it’s been a culmination of the work we’ve been doing for three years, laying the foundations for the first-gen community here at Harvard and spearheading institutional reform here,” said Barros.
Barros and White said they attribute many of the recent institutional changes, such as the creation of the Harvard First Generation Program within the Admissions and Financial Aid Office, to student activism in recent years.
“When I came to Harvard, nobody talked about being a first-gen,” said Barros. “It’s been very hard, and to see this finally coming to fruition is very exciting for us.”
Organizers said they hoped to de-stigmatize conversation about first-generation students, Barros and White said.
“To see all of these people going through the same thing, if anything just that this conference exists, shows that there’s more to that part of my identity that I associate with that I can act on and not be ashamed of,” said Jorge Penado, a student at the University of Pennsylvania who attended the event.

The 31st annual Cultural Rhythms Festival brought students and faculty together in Sanders Theater to watch student groups take to the stage and to celebrate the accomplishments of 2016 Artist of the Year, actress Lucy Liu.
Organized by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and its team of student interns, Saturday’s show featured 12 performance groups.
This was the first year in which Cultural Rhythms programming expanded beyond the show and in which the Undergraduate Council sponsored the traditional food festival following Saturday’s showcase. This year’s event also featured a dialogue series, which included discussions on free speech, performance and identity, and faculty diversity.
Joanne E. Crandall ’17, an attendee of the Cultural Rhythms show, applauded the expanded programming.
“One thing I’m really excited about is how it was integrated into the whole week,” she said.
The additional events come after recent student race-related discussions and activism on campus. The week culminated in a  town hall forum with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to discuss diversity on campus.
Interns and co-directors of Cultural Rhythms Avni Nahar ’17 and Jonathan A. Sands ’17 opened Saturday’s showcase and emphasized the role of the show in promoting cultural diversity on campus and bringing attention to student cultural groups.

“Cultural Rhythms was originally created to give cultural performance groups the ability to perform here on Sander’s stage, Harvard’s largest stage,” Sands said.
The co-directors’ introduction of actress, artist, and activist Liu as the 2016 Artist of the Year was met with loud support from the audience. Liu presided over the performances and interviewed members of each group following their acts.
Foundation director S. Allen Counter, alongside Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, presented Liu with the Artist of the Year award, praising her contributions to film while recognizing her artistic and humanitarian work. Since 2004, Liu has worked as an ambassador for UNICEF and has focused on bringing attention to child-trafficking in countries across the world.
In her acceptance speech, Liu talked about the responsibility of minority groups to embrace and celebrate their cultural heritage.
“It’s our jobs to present who we are and what we believe in,” she said.
The student performances spanned both geography and genre, including acts by the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, Expressions Dance Company, Harvard Taekwondo, and the Asian American Dance Troupe. Among the groups was Omo Naija, a Nigerian dance group founded this year by freshmen.
In addition to those who gathered at the show to support their friends and family, many Harvard administrators, including Khurana and Dean of Freshman and interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman '67, attended.
“It’s one of my favorite events of the year. I’m particularly impressed with the Class of 2019’s dance,” Dingman said during the show’s intermission, referencing Omo Naija.
Attendees of the event praised the diversity and energy of the performances. “ I’ve been here all four years. It’s a great set of performances and show of cultural diversity,” Aaron M. Mukerjee ’16 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Law School activists continue their occupation of the Caspersen Student Center lounge—along with students from other schools—administrators have publicized a series of efforts to address problems of diversity and inclusion on campus.
Activists have been occupying what they call “Belinda Hall,” in honor of a former slave of the Royall family, since last Monday in an effort to create a space they feel has been denied to minority students there. This weekend, after meeting a group of activists from Reclaim Harvard Law at a public service conference at Yale, 10 Yale Law School and five Occidental College students joined their counterparts’ occupation to support and discuss activism across campuses.
Third-year Law student and Reclaim Harvard Law member Bianca S. Tylek said the group hopes to expand its reach to other students within and beyond the Law School. Students from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard Medical School, and Brandeis University joined the occupation last week, which entails a series of programs during each day and students sleeping in the hall at night.
“It was great to share some experiences,” Yale law student Adan Martinez said. “There are ways that Harvard is organizing that are inspiring to us. That’s not necessarily about the mechanics of occupation; it’s more about the mechanics of learning from each other, and pushing each other, and engaging in a conversation together about what this is all about and where it’s going.”
Martinez and Katherine E. Demby, who co-chair Yale Law School’s Alliance for Diversity, drew parallels between Reclaim Harvard Law’s efforts and their own activism at Yale last spring, when they helped lead a movement to increase student and faculty diversity at the school.
While student groups at Yale and Harvard presented similar demands, their reaction to administrators’ response at their respective schools is markedly different. Martinez and Demby said they were pleased and grateful at the level of attention Yale administrators accorded students’ concerns, but Harvard activists remain dissatisfied.
Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow responded to student demands last fall by pledging to hire more diverse faculty and creating a committee to reconsider the school’s controversial seal, which features the shield of the slave-owning Royall family.
In a letter to Law School alumni on Feb. 12, Minow announced a series of initiatives the school is undertaking to further address problems of diversity and inclusion at the school. These efforts, which Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells reiterated in a Feb. 17 email to Law School affiliates, include hiring a Director for Community Engagement and Equity, releasing a campus-wide climate survey, improving sexual assault prevention training, launching a mentoring program, and strengthening diversity training at first year orientation programs.
“These ideas have now moved beyond discussion toward concrete plans. They represent the beginning of the work that we must do together,” Sells wrote in the email.
Activists, however, said these actions are not sufficient; in a statement posted on Reclaim Harvard Law’s website Saturday, they wrote that the group’s calls were “met with administrative intransigence.”
Rena T. Karefa-Johnson, a third-year law student and member of Reclaim Harvard Law, said that she thinks recent initiatives outlined by Minow and Sells fail to address the activists’ particular demands.
“I’m excited that this is something that people are thinking about,” Karefa-Johnson said. “[But] I don’t think those specific initiatives are responsive to what this movement is about.”
Sells said that she stands by her work to address problems of diversity and inclusion at the school, emphasizing that change takes time.
“I am disappointed that the students think we aren’t working on these things, because we are,” she said in an interview. “I understand that they have their own vision and plan, but I’m just trying to work with what I think works best for all of us, and not expecting things to happen all at once.”
Sells sat in on several discussions at the occupation—which she said was “really a teach-in”—last week, but Tylek said activists have not engaged in substantive talks with administrators recently, noting they are collaborating as a group before “re-approach[ing] administrators.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alexandra Abrahams ’17 does not fit the profile of a stereotypical Computer Science concentrator. A transfer student from Oxford University who had previously studied politics and economics, her academic career took a turn after she came to Harvard and enrolled in CS50, the College’s popular introductory computer science course.
While the fact that Abrahams transferred from Oxford and previously considered studying the social sciences may seem unusual, her gender also breaks the typical mold of a Computer Science student. Male students outnumber female students in CS50 by a roughly 2:1 ratio, and Abrahams said she could “count on one hand” the number of times female students asked a question in lecture. 
In the midst of Harvard’s significant financial investments in engineering and applied sciences, the University faces a stark gender inequality across SEAS, mirrored in its Computer Science Department. There are 87 female Computer Science concentrators at Harvard compared to 262 male concentrators, according to Paul Karoff, a spokesperson for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Still, Harvard has begun to focus on bridging the gender gap and encouraging more women like Abrahams to join a field rapidly increasing in popularity.
“The problems of women and tech [begin] long before women enter college,” Abrahams said. “I think Harvard is doing a great job.”
Although Abrahams said she found CS50 was dominated by male voices in the classroom, she thought the class material was engaging and said external social support structures gave her a crucial sense of community. While female Computer Science concentrators are significantly outnumbered by their male counterparts, both at Harvard and nationally, a committee at SEAS was recently appointed to investigate and increase diversity within Computer Science.
Outside the classroom, organizations like Women in Computer Science and recruiters at major tech companies have also made conscious efforts to hire more women and decrease the gender imbalance within their own workplaces.
The department still faces a stark gender imbalance, but the number of women Computer Science concentrators is gradually increasing. At SEAS’s inception as a formal school in 2007, women constituted little more than 18 percent of the department. Today, that number is roughly a quarter.
“I would love to see our numbers be 50-50,” Computer Science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83 said.
LAUNCH CODE
Often, students say they consider the typical computer science undergraduate as a male. Many female concentrators said that perception made them hesitant to take computer science classes, or even consider the concentration.
Ann Hwang ’18, a computer science concentrator, said she felt she knew less about the subject than her male peers at Harvard despite taking two years of computer science in high school.
“The guys around me seemed to know more about CS than I did,” Hwang said. “For me as a girl, no one had ever talked to me about CS going in. I already felt behind.”
More broadly, students said there exists a popular perception that careers in computer science are for introverts who spend more time coding in basements than socializing.
Michelle Danoff ’17, co-president of Women in Computer Science, said such a perception can discourage women from entering the field, because they are less likely to envision computer science as a part of their future.
“Breaking the stereotype and getting people to reconceptualize is a huge challenge,” Danoff said.
Administrators said they are aware of the cultural norms that can intimidate female students or make them cautious about entering the field, and are taking steps to actively address them before students even enter Harvard Yard.
The Computer Science Department works with the undergraduate Harvard Computer Society and Women in Computer Science to contact admitted freshmen who indicate an interest in studying computer science during their time at Harvard.
“We make sure that everybody gets contacted,”  said Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, who is currently the director of undergraduate studies in Computer Science. “The women will get two calls, and the men get one.”
The department also recognizes the role of CS50 in encouraging females to consider the concentration, since that class often offers students their first exposure to the subject.
Lewis said CS50 is “shaped by [course head] David Malan’s consciousness by making sure that it is open to women as an academic pursuit and as a career option.”
While there is limited women-specific outreach for CS50, the course’s broader aim to lower the barrier of entry to computer science has encouraged more students to give the field a try.
Initiatives like the introduction of the “satisfactory/unsatisfactory” grading option for CS50, and the unusual allowance to count CS50 if taken without a letter grade for concentration credit, “provid[e] a way into the field with a low-risk first course,” Lewis added.
According to David J. Malan ’99, CS50’s instructor—who surveys his classes for demographic information—the number of women in CS50 has risen from 31 percent to 38 percent since last fall, reflecting efforts to promote gender equality.
LONG TERM PROGRAMMING
Getting more women through the door of the Computer Science department, and into an introductory course, is just the first step in administrative and student efforts to increase the number of women who leave Harvard with a degree in the field.
Undergraduates often cited female mentorship as a key contributing factor to sticking with the concentration past the introductory level. In a department whose faculty is also male-dominated—a significant majority are men, according to the SEAS website—administrators and professors seek to provide more opportunities for female mentorship at present while narrowing the Computer Science faculty gender gap in the long term.
Although the number of women faculty remains low, professors said they are working to increase the pool of potential faculty candidates by hiring more female teaching fellows.
Lewis said the Computer Science Department has been “very conscious in developing the pool of faculty candidates to look for strong women candidates.” In his class, CS 20: “Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science,” four out of seven TFs are women, he said.
Professors without the power to directly hire faculty are individually encouraging  female students in the classroom. Seltzer, who also serves as a faculty mentor to Women in Computer Science, said she forms gender-balanced teams in class so that women do not feel outnumbered.
“I think carefully when I form groups,” Seltzer said. “I’d rather have one male group and other groups with a 50-50 split, rather than have groups with only one female in it.”
Seltzer said she also incorporates a blind grading system and picks gender-neutral names when she writes problem sets to challenge implicit biases against women.
There is also institutional support for achieving gender balance among students in the department. Two months ago, the department established the Diversity in Computer Science Committee—chaired by professor of the practice James H. Waldo—with the goal of increasing the number of female students entering the department and then retaining them through graduation.
“The good news is that we’re really serious about this, and we really want to make some changes,” Waldo said. “The goal is to make women concentrating in CS feel more at home than they currently do.”
Outside the classroom, social support structures—primarily Women in Computer Science—are instrumental in making sure female concentrators do not feel alone or unsupported. 
Hana Kim ’16, co-president of the group, said having a community is crucial to building camaraderie through shared challenges.
“With CS, there are so many moments where you’re really struggling and hit the wall,” Kim said. “Unless you have people you are comfortable in sharing those experiences with, it can make you feel alone and that you’re not cut out for the concentration.”
Abrahams added that being involved in the women computer science student group on campus helped her feel more included and less of an outsider.
“I know that if I wasn’t involved in [Women Engineers Code] or the WiCS advocacy council, that I would come to the conclusion that there weren’t many women in tech here,” she said.
WELCOME TO SILICON VALLEY
Despite barriers that exist for women considering Computer Science, there is an upside for concentrators when they begin their job search—companies often seek women who study the subject.
“[CS concentrators] are very very highly sought after, particularly women,” SEAS director of experiential and career development Keith R. Karasek said. “I field inquiries from companies who want to deal with students, they want particularly to get connected with WiCS… they really are swarming.”
According to Microsoft recruiter Rebecca Tucker, companies look to Harvard to “recruit for diversity” and often partner with student organizations to reach their members, starting as early as freshmen year.
“We do tech talks where we bring in female alums to tell their story, where a decade ago they were the only female in their class,” Tucker said. “Every tech company would love more female grads and more diverse grads.”
Tucker said gender diversity in the workplace is integral in the tech industry in order to build better products that sell to a broader market, and because “it’s just the right thing to do.”
While gender equality in companies has been the subject of scrutiny for the finance industry, over the years, the conversation has increasingly focused on computer science, according to Office of Career Services Director Robin Mount.
As Harvard seeks to increase the number of female students pursuing careers in computer science, the outside world often looks at how the University tackles the problem as it increasingly embraces technology and engineering.
“Harvard is a thought leader in the research it can do, and the changes it can make sets the standard for the industry.” Alaina Percival, CEO of Women Who Code, said. “It has both the ability and the need to be better about gender diversity in computer science.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday’s season-opening showdown in men’s lacrosse between No. 17/18 Harvard and No. RV/20 Villanova provided both teams with the chance to prove their spots in the rankings and secure a statement nonconference win. The two squads knew what was at stake and played accordingly, but as time winded down in regulation, nothing could separate them, and the match headed to sudden-death overtime, tied 12-12.
After dominating at the faceoff X throughout regulation, the Wildcats once again won possession when their sophomore faceoff specialist Luke Palmadesso picked up his 11th ground ball of the day. Villanova looked poised to score the game-winning goal, as it held not only possession of the ball but also the momentum.
Moments earlier, the Wildcats had reeled off three goals in 20 seconds to erase a 12-9 deficit with a little more than four minutes remaining. With Crimson sophomore goalie Robert Shaw making the first start of his collegiate career, Villanova was piling on the pressure and had Shaw and his defensemen on their heels.
Just as it had all game, Harvard’s defense bent but did not break. It forced a quick turnover in overtime, handing the ball back to the offense. Wildcats junior goalie Dan Willis prolonged the game with two saves, but Crimson sophomore attackman Morgan Cheek finally broke through with the tiebreaking score, his third of the game. Using his strength to turn the corner and gain a strong position just to the left of the goal, he fired a powerful shot past Willis and into the net.
The brilliant solo effort earned the win for Harvard (1-0) in a game that featured four lead changes and could have gone either way. Villanova (0-1), meanwhile, left Jordan Field still seeking its first win of the season.
The loss certainly came as a letdown for the Wildcats, who held a 6-2 lead at one point in the second quarter and had multiple chances to jump ahead at the end of the game. Each time, however, the Crimson made the necessary adjustments on defense to keep Villanova at bay.
“Initially defensively, we didn’t come out as aggressive as we hoped,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We were a step too slow in our help defense and allowed them to get too comfortable moving the ball. The biggest adjustment we made was [starting to] go at them and being more aggressive.”
With the added defensive pressure, the Crimson held the Wildcats to just two goals between the 13:23 mark of the second quarter and the start of the fourth quarter. In the process, the 6-2 deficit turned into an 8-8 tie.
“We’ve emphasized all week that we need to focus on ourselves and not worry about what the other team’s doing,” sophomore attackman Joe Lang said. “We trusted our ability to stop them, and we knew we’d get our shots.”
Lang scored one of his three goals during the furious comeback, but the sophomore made his biggest contributions in the fourth quarter when the game was tied, 9-9. Within one minute, he fired two long distance shots into the net, both from almost the exact same spot.
“We got a few mismatches and decided to space out the field to make it harder for them to play help defense,” Lang said. “And when it worked once, we went back to it again.”
Senior midfielder Ian Ardrey, Harvard’s second leading scorer in 2015, added a goal of his own after Lang’s two to push the lead to 12-9. With just five minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Crimson looked to be on its way to victory.
The team’s failure to control the faceoff X finally came back to bite it, however, as Villanova won four straight faceoffs that led to three quick goals. The Wildcats then had a chance to win the game in the final minute but were finally stopped by the Harvard defense.
“It all came down to composure in the end,” Wojcik said. “We have guys back there with a lot of experience who have been in those situations before, and that helped us hold down the tie in both regulation and overtime, until we could get the game-winner.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Nordic and Alpine Ski team took home its fifth consecutive top-10 finish this weekend, finishing 10th out of the 16 teams competing in the annual Williams Carnival. The team posted strong individual performances throughout the weekend, with junior Rachel Hampton bringing home top-20 finishes in the 5K and 10K races and seniors Annie Harvieux and Hanna Barnes both earning career-best finishes.
The Nordic team took to the slopes Friday and Saturday in Lake Placid, N.Y. In the women’s 10K, finishing less than 15 seconds after Hampton, Harvieux posted her top finish of the season at 24th. Barnes was hot on her heels in 30th, and freshman Hannah Hardenbergh, freshman Nina Armstrong, and sophomore Charlotte Cole followed in 42nd, 46th, and 52nd respectively.
In the men’s 10K, junior Devlin Shea and sophomore Connor Green led the way in 39th and 40th, respectively, followed by Liam Mulshine in 44th.
Hampton finished the 5K in  46:32 to take 15th, followed by Barnes with a career-best 24th and Harvieux in 27th. Their efforts put Harvard in 8th place of the 13 teams.
On the men’s side, Shea again led the pack for the Crimson, this time finishing in 37th. Junior Ian Meyer and Green rounded out the men’s team in 43rd and 44th, respectively.
“This was a really unusual weekend for us,” co-captain Soren Anderson said. “We typically don’t race 5K’s and because they are such a small part of our schedule we don’t really train to race them…. Overall I think we did well given our limited preparation.”
In addition to racing a shorter distance than usual, the Nordic team faced a rain scare and unusually warm temperatures.
“We were worried that it was going to rain,” Anderson said. “It held off for the most part and luckily we were able to find the right wax for the conditions which is…. difficult considering what we were dealing with.”
On the Alpine side, sophomore Kelly Steeves led the team with top-30 finishes in both the Slalom and Giant Slalom races. Steeves was the only Harvard scorer in the Giant Slalom, finishing 25th, and she clocked in at 27th in the Slalom race, followed by junior Kaitlyn Gibson at 47th.
Alice Merryweather, the sister of men’s co-captain Simon, also raced in the Williams Carnival, finishing with a time of 1:34.94 in Friday's Giant Slalom, which would have been good for fourth in the collegiate results.
The younger Merryweather deferred her acceptance from Harvard and is currently skiing on the United States Ski Team. She was recently named to the 2016 FIS Alpine Junior Worlds Team and will be competing for the United States in the Junior World Ski Championships from February 24th – March 5th at Rosa Khutor in Sochi, Russia.
“I think Simon had a really great time racing with [Alice] again,” Steeves said. “We are very excited for when she comes to join us.”
Due to the unusually warm weather and changing temperatures, the location and timing of the team’s next race is unclear. If there is sufficient snow, the EISA Championships will take place next weekend.
“It doesn’t really look like anywhere that we might race has snow as of now…. But we’ll probably find someplace,” Anderson said.
With only two more races lined up for the season, the team is looking forward to keeping up its momentum and finishing on a strong note.
“I think especially the seniors are really ready to ski hard and go fast,” Steeves said. “We are really going to try to put it all on the line and prove to everyone what we can do.”

The Harvard men’s volleyball team swept George Mason 3-0, 3-1, in a tight two-game series this weekend. Executing with the match was on the line, the Crimson (6-5, 3-1 EIVA) fought the Patriots (5-8, 1-2) for every set and came out victorious over the two-day stretch in Fairfax, Va.
HARVARD 3, GEORGE MASON 1
On Saturday, facing the Patriots for the second time in as many days, Harvard (6-5, 3-1 EIVA) came out strong, racing to a 2-0 game lead. The dominant opening seemed to leave little doubt as to what would happen next--an equally dominant third-set, a match victory, and a smooth ride back to Cambridge.
Instead, the Crimson lost momentum in the third set, allowing George Mason to force a fourth. Jack Wilson recorded seven kills, Radoslav Popov recorded four, and the Patriots led from beginning to end, winning by a 10-point margin.
“We came out very flat in the third set,” Harvard captain Branden Clemens said. “The 10-minute break between the second and third set can sometimes be tough because it takes the rhythm out of the game.”
But the momentum eventually swung back to the Crimson. Trailing 20-19 at the end of a fourth set that had 12 tied scores, Harvard proceeded to go on a four-point run. Two kills by sophomore middle blocker Riley Moore sealed the deal as the Crimson claimed the match with a 25-23 set win.
The game-winning frame was made possible largely due to an early two-set lead. Clinging to just a one-point advantage in the first, the Crimson created separation, closing with a 5-1 run to win, 25-18.
Stretching its lead in the second set and out-hitting George Mason, 34.8 percent to 0, Harvard handled the Patriots more readily in a 25-15 victory. Setter Marko Kostich earned an assist on the final point. The sophomore ended the game with 33 assists to go along with 10 digs, turning in his second career double-double.
“Overall we played a great match, but in the third set on Saturday, we came out slow after the break,” Gretsch said. “We need to keep our focus and continue to play hard for every set, even if we were winning the ones before easily.”
HARVARD 3, GEORGE MASON 0
It was a wild one on Friday night--as wild as a three-game sweep could be.
Despite a total of 26 tied scores in the first two sets alone, the Crimson won clutch points down the stretch to defeat its conference foe, 3-0.
The high mark was a tense second set that went to 38-38 before the Crimson tallied consecutive points to take a 2-0 overall lead. Harvard had lost seven potential game points before that point but erased those memories thanks to kills by sophomores Kostich and outside hitter Brad Gretsch.
In the first set, again earning the points when they mattered the most, the Crimson rallied to overcome a 24-22 deficit and steal the frame. An ace by Gretsch and a kill by junior outside hitter Casey White capped the set, and the final point was the first time that Harvard had led all night.
"As a team we were serving well, which made it much easier for us to play defense around our block and put pressure on their pin hitters,” Gretsch said. “Individually and as a team, we were passing very well...which opened up our offense and gave our setter four options.”
However, even the third set was defined by tense back-and-forth play until a block by Kostich and Moore left Harvard with a slight 21-19 lead. After an ace by Gretsch and an attack error by the Patriots added to the margin, White finalized the victory with a kill, ending the set at 25-22.
On the night, Gretsch tallied his first career double-double with 12 kills and 10 digs and was supported by freshman middle blocker Trevor Dow, who ended with a career-best hitting percentage of 83 percent..
“We have been a very energetic and loud team that comes out willing to fight every game,” Clemens said. “What was really good about this weekend’s games was the fact that we were able to use that energy but then in tight situations stay calm and collected.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a bit under four minutes left on the clock, a long three from Cornell guard Megan LeDuc hushed the crowd at Lavietes Pavilion. An eight-point lead held by the Harvard women’s basketball team just four minutes earlier had dwindled down to one, 58-57.
But despite the late surge from the Big Red on Saturday, the Crimson responded with a three of its own, courtesy of co-captain Kit Metoyer. After a layup from Cornell cut Harvard’s lead to two, senior Shilpa Tummala responded much like she usually does—with a deep three—this one off a pass from freshman Sydney Skinnner.
From there, the majority of both teams’ points would come at the line. After cutting the lead to three off a pair of free throws, the Big Red (13-11, 5-5 Ivy) could not pull any closer despite pulling down three offensive rebounds on the ensuing possession. The Crimson (12-11, 7-3) would go on to make four of six at the line to lock up a 68-63 win.
“I know in the end it was a little tough because we missed a few rebounds, which definitely would’ve helped us out, but even with that adversity we still pushed through and were consistent,” co-captain AnnMarie Healy said.
The win extended Harvard’s win streak against Cornell to 17, but perhaps even more impressive is the fact that it kept the Big Red winless in Cambridge—the Crimson is a perfect 34-0 against Cornell at home since they first played in 1975.
Despite the historic implications of the matchup, Harvard’s latest win came by way of no easy affair. After outlasting the Big Red in overtime only three weeks ago, the Crimson’s win on Saturday came at an equally close margin.
Throughout the first quarter, neither team could seem to get their shots to fall. Five Cornell turnovers and poor shooting on behalf of Harvard brought the quarter to an end with the Big Red up, 13-12.
“I thought we were pretty sporadic,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I thought offensively we weren’t executing our system well at all. We were going one-on-one or taking threes. I don’t think we were very patient, I don’t think we executed well, and I don’t think we rebounded well.”
Despite the slow start, the two sides were neck and neck for much of the rest of the game. After a 9-2 run put Cornell up by six late in the second quarter, the Crimson responded with a three from Skinner. A long three from Metoyer a few minutes later tied the game at the half, 32-32.
Coming off a win against Columbia that saw the Harvard outrebound the Lions and force 23 turnovers in a 30-point victory, the Crimson’s defense struggled to shut down Cornell inside, specifically when it came to junior forward Nia Marshall. She finished with 16 points, nine rebounds, and two steals.
“Nia is one of the best players in the league, statistically and otherwise,” Delaney-Smith said. “We knew coming in that we had to work on her. If you isolate Nia on the perimeter or even on the block, she really has an ability to score. [We] needed help off of other people.”
In a game that featured 14 lead changes, Harvard’s seniors led the way per usual. The senior trio of Healy, Tummala, and Metoyer combined for 43 points and 15 rebounds.
“Shilpa is a go-to [scorer], so is Kit, so is AnnMarie,” Delaney-Smith said. “The three of them, to their credit, want the ball and want to score.”
Late in the game, the Big Red continued to outrebound the Crimson, but the visitors could not capitalize on offense. In the second half, Cornell shot 33 percent from the field. While the Crimson only shot 35 percent over the same frame, Harvard stayed ahead with shots from beyond the arc and good defense.
“We took some chances.” Delaney-Smith said. “We threw some zone at them at the end, we took some risks, just to break the rhythm up, and it worked.”
It was the late defensive effort from the Crimson that ultimately held off the Big Red. Despite giving up offensive rebounds on late possessions, Harvard managed to keep Cornell off the scoreboard late.
“I think something we’re really focusing on, especially in these last games is consistency,” Healy said. “I’m really proud of the team and how there were no big runs or letdowns by ourselves. I’m really excited that we were able to play good, hard defense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team scored three goals in the first three minutes Saturday against Hofstra, and before the Pride could even manage an offensive possession, it was already staring at a 3-0 deficit.
In a preview of how the rest of the game would play out, sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn netted two solo goals and junior attacker Marisa Romeo added one of her own in a successful return from injury.
The two combined would go on to outscore Hofstra by themselves, pacing the Crimson to a comprehensive 16-8 victory. Glynn finished the day with six goals, a career high, while Romeo had four.
With the win, Harvard (1-0, 0-0 Ivy) wins its season opener for the second year in a row. The team has not strung together consecutive such wins since 2007-2010, when it won its opener in four straight years. At that time, current coach Lisa Miller was only just getting started at the helm of the program.
The Pride (0-2, 0-0 CAA), meanwhile, was handed another defeat after losing away at New Hampshire last weekend. The team’s fans at James M. Shuart Stadium could not inspire Hofstra to victory in its home opener against the Crimson.
Just as in its first game, the Pride fell in a quick hole at the beginning. The closest it drew to Harvard was when it cut the deficit to 4-2 on a free position shot at the 7:41 mark of the first half. Crimson junior attacker Maeve McMahon hit back with a goal two minutes later, however, and Hofstra was never within less than three goals again.
“We won most of the draw controls at the beginning of the game, and that helped us a lot,” said senior midfielder and Harvard co-captain Audrey Todd. “Then, on offense, we focused on looking for really good opportunities and setting the pace of the game ourselves.”
The Crimson dictated the pace for the first ten minutes of the game, holding possession and racing out to an 8-3 lead. The Pride responded by pulling junior goalie Alexis Greene, who had up until that point made only one save, and replaced her with freshman netminder Maddie Fields.
Hofstra put together a 3-1 run following the switch in goal, closing the margin to 9-6, but Harvard senior goalie Kelly Weis buckled down to make several great saves and hold the Pride scoreless for the final 14:57 of the half.
“We got beat a couple of times where we probably shouldn’t have,” Weis said. “But then, our defense clamped down; we took more of their attackers one-on-one and were able to stop them that way.”
The Crimson’s experienced back line of juniors Marina Burke and Emma Ford, and senior Tory Waldstein, were integral to the strong defensive stretch that made sure their team went into halftime with a comfortable 11-6 lead. All three players have two or more years of starting experience, creating mismatches against Hofstra’s two freshmen starting attackers.
The second half played out at a considerably slower pace, with only seven goals compared to the first half’s seventeen.
Fields made several strong saves to keep the Pride in the game at the beginning of the second half, but four straight goals by Harvard spanning the middle 10 minutes of the half put the score at an insurmountable 15-7.
Several of these goals were the result of better team play, as the Crimson assisted on three of their five final tallies after assisting on only one of the first 11.
“We have a pretty dynamic attacking unit, and everyone is confident with the ball,” Todd said. “We always look to pass, but they were sending some early slides at the start of the game and we found more opportunities one-on-one.”
During this time, Weis added to her save total. She finished with a total of 10 for the afternoon. Glynn also tacked on two more goals and an assist, bringing her to a total of seven points on the day.
“[Glynn] played a great game but it was also the entire team that made the win happen,“ Weis said. “It’s definitely good to get that first win out of the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a long weekend for the Harvard women’s tennis team, who matched up against Boston University, Marist, and Maryland on Friday and Saturday. After narrowly beating out BU, 4-3, the Crimson recorded convincing wins against Maryland and Marist, 6-1 and 4-0, respectively. Harvard improved to 5-4 on the year after the three-game sweep.
HARVARD 4, MARIST 0
After last week’s tight 4-3 loss to Portland, the Crimson was looking for a response, and the results over the weekend have begun to indicate improvement.
Harvard capped its weekend against Marist (2-4), who entered the contest on a three-game losing streak, continuing a theme with Crimson opponents throughout the weekend.
But all that meant for Harvard was that the teams it played had little to lose.
“The teams we played all came out with no pressure, and it's hard to play teams like that, so it was a good weekend for us,” junior June Lee said.
To round off the successful weekend, the Crimson came out strong in doubles, and went into singles with a 1-0 lead on behalf of Lee and freshman Isabel Jaspers’s clinching doubles win.
Three singles wins later, the match would end, leaving three games unfinished with the score 4-0. Sophomore Nikki Kallenberg, senior Amy He, and junior Danielle Mirda recorded the individual victories.
HARVARD 6, MARYLAND 1
Much like Marist, Maryland (1-4) did not come into the match in the best of form. The team dropped its last two contests, 6-1 and 4-2, against LSU and Tulane, respectively. And after Saturday’s noon matchup in the Murr Center, Maryland’s winless streak would continue.
The Terps got off to a good start, gaining the lead after securing two out of three wins in doubles play. But that would be the only point Maryland could amass, as Harvard proceeded to sweep singles.
Though the scoreline of 6-1 suggests a walk-over, the Crimson competitors were pushed to three sets in four out of the six individual matches.
In registering the win, the Crimson also logged one first.
“It was the first time we lost the doubles point and won, and it was the first time we won every singles match,” Lee said.
HARVARD 4, BU 3
The BU squad (3-3) was already on a two-game losing streak following losses to Ivy Leaguers Yale and Dartmouth when the team arrived to the Murr Center on Friday afternoon. While its last loss at Dartmouth was a 7-0 drubbing, the match against Harvard proved to be a much more even contest.
The Crimson started strong, clinching the all important doubles point. The duos of freshman Erica Oosterhout and Lee and Kallenberg and Jasper would win 6-3 and 6-4, respectively. The pair of sophomore Annika Ringblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong pair would not finish its match because Harvard had already won the point.
Despite going down 1-0, the Terriers came back firing, as its one, two, and three seeds all beat their Harvard counterparts.
BU’s Johanna Hyoty impressed with her win over Lee on court one. After trading the first two sets, Hyoty managed to outlast Lee and record the win, 10-8, in the final set.
But as part of the Crimson squad faltered, seeds four through six were ready to shoulder the responsibility.
On court five, Xiong topped Remi Ramos with a confident 6-1, 6-0 display. Amy He had a similarly simple match, beating BU’s Barbara Rodriguez 6-2 before she retired.
It came down to Oosterhout to force through a Crimson win, and she did just that with a 6-0, 2-6, 6-2 performance to lift her squad.
“The fact that our four, five and six players got the win for us against BU just shows that our team has a lot of depth, and anyone in our lineup could be getting us the win on any day,” Lee said.
The key behind Harvard’s weekend success? In the context of the three-match weekend, it seems self-evident.
“I would say our biggest strength is we all have the ability and fitness to compete in every match and every point,” Ringblom said.
The Crimson now has a streak of its own—three consecutive wins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year ago, Harvard Women’s Swimming and Diving conceded the Ivy League title to Princeton—after holding onto the lead for the first two days of competition. This weekend, the Crimson (5-2, 5-2 Ivy) returned to take back its victory with 1500.5 points, smashing plenty of records in the process.
However, it was not the score that motivated the squad.
“We treated every session like it was a blank slate, and took advantage of each session to prove how hard we have worked throughout the season,” freshman Meagan Popp said.
Dramatic performances came in the pool and on the boards alike. Harvard divers dominated, doing their fair share of work towards the Ivy League title.
Freshman Mikaela Thompson broke the meet record in the one-meter, her score of 314.20 trumping the seven-year-old record of 312.05, and coming out over 20 points ahead of the silver medal winner.
Thompson was trailed by Crimson sophomores Alisha Mah, and Jing Leung, and freshman Katie Russ in third, fourth, and fifth respectively.
“I tried to leave nothing on the boards, and go for it, with the goal of placing as high as possible to score points for the team,” Thompson said. “I took it dive by dive, and focused on what I had to do to perform each dive well.”
Thompson also had an action-packed three-meter competition. Four dives into prelims, the freshman found herself in 23rd place. Her next dive earned her a spot in the finals, where she finished seventh.
In addition, every single Crimson competitor made it to the finals of the event, where they took up six of the top-eight spots, making Ancient Eight history. Sophomore Hannah Allchurch took first with 334.95, while Leung took bronze with 315.70.
The swimmers also saw a fair share of glory, with victories and records across a variety of events. Popp topped the podium multiple times, notably in the 200 IM, where her time of 1:57.94 took first, and broke a school record in the process.
However, Popp was not content with just one record-breaking finish. Her time of 101.65 in the 100 breast garnered a silver medal and another place in Harvard’s record books. The freshman also took part in the 800 free relay, taking second place and demolishing yet another school record.
In addition, Popp returned to Cambridge boasting a tie for gold in the 200 breaststroke, second place finish on the 400 medley relay team, and a third in the 200 medley relay, placing top-three in every race she entered.
“I was just feeding off the energy of my team,” Popp said. “Seeing them cheer and dance for me before my races made me smile and gave me confidence that my entire team had my back.”
But it was not just the rookies making waves in Princeton’s DeNunzio Pool. Fellow relay record-breaker and senior Danielle Lee had her fair share of success, taking first in the 100 back for the third consecutive year with a time of 53.13.
The veteran again took to the podium in the 200 back, her time of 1:55.71 good for second, after tying Princeton’s Lindsay Temple in the prelims.
“A big part of what enabled us to be successful this season was leadership,” Thompson said. “Our captains not only lead by example, but also motivated us and helped to push us as individual athletes and as a team.” Another set of standout performances came from freshman Sonia Wang.
The California native took gold in the 400 IM, setting the second-best mark in program history with a time of 4:11.42. And, as the only Crimson swimmer in the final of the 200 butterfly, Wang again topped the podium, touching the wall in 1:57.02.
But despite the slew of records shattered and qualifications met, this meet really came down to the joy of the sport for the Crimson.
“By this point in the season it is time to show off the result of all of the hard work that we have been putting into the pool,” Thompson said. “To race for the sake of racing, and dive for the sake of diving.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last regular season weekend of the 2015-2016 school year, the Harvard women’s hockey team embarked on a trip to New York with hopes of solidifying a spot among the top ECAC teams in playoff contention. Yet after two 3-2 decisions, one that favored the Crimson and one that did not, the team will head on the road to Colgate next weekend as the visiting team in ECAC playoffs.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 2 (OT)
The capstone game of the regular season came in the form of a disappointing decision in Ithaca. Harvard (16-10-3, 12-7-3 ECAC) entered the face off as the favorite, ranked among the top five in the conference while Cornell (13-12-4, 9-9-4) held down the eighth spot. After playing just over 60 minutes of hockey, the tables had turned on the Crimson, leaving the team with a loss.
“We went into the weekend wanting to come out with two wins,” freshman defender Kate Hallett said. “That being said, we went out there are we really did play to the best of our abilities. We really worked hard... sometimes that’s hockey and you don’t come out with the win.”
It took some time for Harvard’s offense to get off the ground and convert drives on the ice. The Big Red took an early lead in the first 10 minutes of play with a power play goal at the 8:36 mark of the first period.
Cornell had the man-advantage after sophomore forward Karly Heffernan was sent to the penalty box for tripping, giving Cornell senior forward Taylor Woods the opportunity to sneak the puck past goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer.
Despite having seven fewer shots on goal than the Crimson, the Big Red was able to capitalize on defensive mistakes made by Harvard’s offense.
Down 2-0 entering the second period, junior forward Sydney Daniels awoke Harvard’s offense with her 17th and 18th goals of the season, pushing the game into a tie at the end of regulation.
Cornell responded almost immediately into the overtime period, scoring a goal within the first minute of play and sealing the Crimson’s fate for its playoff run.
“[The goal] was heartbreaking,” Ziadie said. “They came back really quickly and scored and the momentum totally shifted from all the positivity that we had built up in the second period and the losing in that moment was really really hard for us.”
HARVARD 3, NO. 10/10 COLGATE 2
Both teams came into Friday evening’s match up fighting for fourth place in the ECAC standings, with the Crimson two points behind the Raiders. Colgate (20-7-7, 12-5-5) also entered ranked at No.10/10 in the nation, giving Harvard its first victory against a ranked opponent in the month of February.
The Crimson was able to jump out of the gate early against the Raiders, finding the back of its opponent’s net twice in the opening 20 minutes of play.
“It’s really important [to be aggressive early in the game],” Ziadie said. “Against Colgate we came out flying in the first period and that’s something we didn’t necessarily do against Cornell…. For that whole 60 minutes we were all over them and that made a huge difference.”
Senior forward Miye D’Oench got the scoring going for Harvard with her 14th goal of the season, getting help from Heffernan and senior co-captain Michelle Picard. Daniels netted a power play goal at the end of the first to give the Crimson a two goal advantage.
The Big Red came rolling back in the second period, scoring two goals to tie the game at two. Sophomore forward Annika Zalewski had both of the Raider goals, beating Maschmeyer twice.
The winning goal came from the stick of freshman Grace Zarzecki, who has made a reputation for herself this early in her career. Currently, she is the team’s third most productive scorer, with nine goals on the season.
“It’s huge to have contributions from all years because it shows the depth of the team,” Hallett said. “It shows that at the end of the day we are all one team. At this point in the year we freshmen have gotten used to it... We know what’s expected of us.”

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
First of all: are you following the Ivy League campus story? That’s probably the best place to get news about what is happening in and around the elite schools of the North East, but if you haven’t been keeping up, Flyby is here to fill you in.
Harvard may have had Lucy Liu and Conan O’Brien visit, but Penn had Caitlyn Jenner. Reactions to the event were mixed, with the Daily Pennsylvanian reporting that front-row audience members left early, and that many students were “disappointed” and found Jenner “self-absorbed.” Surprising! Who would have expected that from a reality TV star?
Demonstrations continue at Yale. Most recently, Fossil Free Yale (FFY) gathered outside the president’s office to protest the Yale Corporation. The demonstrating students voiced concerns about the secretive nature of the University’s official governing board, setting up four faceless mannequins to symbolize the Corporation, as well as the university’s divestment policy.
At Duke, which granted is not in the Ivy League, but is often grouped in along with us, a Delta Sigma Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma mixer “Kappa Kops” caused controversy on campus, and motivated a “teach-in on prison abolition and the ways in which mass incarceration is tied up in systems of power evident in greek life.” Protesters called for the abolishment of both the American prison system and Greek life. One individual even held a sign reading “Rush KKKG.” There’s definitely a lesson to be learned here regarding putting a little thought into your choice of theme for that next mixer.
Brown students should take note, as it appears that sorority girls have infiltrated the campus. We’re a little confused by this, as we thought Brown only had two types of students -- hipsters and hippies.

If you are anything like us at Flyby, you've probably procrastinated on planning your Spring Break until now. But don’t worry, dear reader, we've got you covered. Here are some cool last minute spring break options for you and your lazy and/or disorganized friends.
Exotic but affordableWhere: Reykjavik, IcelandYou’re probably thinking: Why would I want to go to a place called Iceland, which seems like Boston’s evil twin? Boston gets enough snow already. But fear not, fellow Harvardians. Dubbed the nightlife capital of the North, Reykjavik is the new hot place. Known for its breathtaking national parks, Iceland offers volcano and glacier hikes, whitewater rafting and crystal blue lagoons full of naturally warm ocean water. You read that correctly. There are hot springs. And at night, you can go out to the many bars and clubs sprawling throughout the capital. (The drinking age is 20, by the way, for you thirsty sophomores out there.) An added bonus is that with only three more weeks until spring break, the round trip flights cost around $400 for a 5-hour flight each way. So go! Find those tickets on Student Universe before the prices soar.
OutdoorsyWhere: Red River Gorge, KentuckyWhen: 3/12-3/20Who: Harvard Mountaineering ClubCost: $150 + gearFor all you outdoorsy people that love getting down and dirty with Mother Nature, this is the trip for you. The Harvard Mountaineering Club offers a climbing trip every year and this year they are headed to the Red River Gorge in Kentucky. The trip begins with a 14-hour road trip where you get all cozy and comfy (maybe a little too comfy) with your fellow climbers. Once you arrive at the nature reserve, you spend a week camping and climbing cliffs. They take a mix of experienced and inexperienced climbers and rent out gear, so no need to fret if you’re a novice and don’t even know what a carabiner is.
VolunteeringWhere: MississippiWho: PBHAIf you are looking for a really fruitful yet alternative experience, the PBHA alternative spring break trips might be right for you. Every year the organization plans service trips to cities across the US. Fortunately for you procrastinators out there, the Mississippi trip, focusing on Civil Rights, is still taking applications. Apply now before the spots fill up!
StaycationWhere: Good ole BostonIf all the midterms got you down and you just want to Netflix and chill (literally) in the comfort of your dorm room, treat yourself to a staycation. Once you’ve finished binge watching the entirety of Scandal, muster up the courage to venture out into the icy depths of Boston (although no one really knows what’s up with the weather, it could be sunny, who knows) and become a tourist in your own city! It shouldn’t be too hard as we can model ourselves after the myriad tourists we bump into everyday on the way to class. Explore Quincy Market and Boston Common, watch all the box office hits you haven’t seen since the semester started, finally go to the MFA, and maybe gorge yourself with some quality pasta at the North End. Relish your free time in Boston and Cambridge before all those psets and papers start again.
No matter who you are, or what you like to do in your (nonexistent) free time, there are still plenty of viable Spring Break options. Someday you’ll have to learn that waiting until the last minute for everything isn’t sustainable, but today is not that day!
