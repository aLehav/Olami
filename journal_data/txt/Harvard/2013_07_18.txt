After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ZANZIBAR, Tanzania—Dusty red was the blur of a young girl’s headscarf as she darted through the bumpy streets of the inner island, her stick-thin legs flying under a faded orange skirt, her silhouette a sunset complementing the Zanzibari winter air.
Blue was the water rising from depths unknown; we snorkeled through sapphire waves and white crests, and later I heaved my guts over the side of the boat, rocking so violently across waters whose calm colors belied their high-tide ferocity.
Eye-burning magenta was the fresh lobster, spiced and crisped in Stone Town’s night market, illuminated by shockingly yellow kerosene lanterns and roaring grills. Crumbling off-white fortresses newly converted to sleek restaurants and harem-pant vendors ringed the square under the full harvest moon.
Green was everywhere, from the newly burst leaves I fed a weathered old tortoise to the palm trees planted along a beach so white it could blind. My upper back turned pink and tight as I bent over the clearest waters I’d ever seen to collect small pink-and-purple shells at low tide. When I returned 30 minutes later from the artificially chlorinated pool, the water had swept across the vast plain, covering the shell beds as though they’d never been there. “Where do shells come from?” my friend asked, and I said I thought they’d all been animals’ homes before. If everyone collected as many shells as I did, how many would be left?
I knew the sun would burn red and orange across the water that night, but we had to leave the beach 15 minutes before sunset and never saw it. I projected past images onto the horizon, changing my memory so by the time I left I was half-sure I’d seen the sun sink in bloody colors.
I wore all black when I went out dancing because it was all I had that was clean, and little grains of sand stuck to the fabric like the stars I knew the clouds obscured. I tried to wash them off when I swam in the ocean, but then my clothes wouldn’t dry for days and my backpack kept the smell of the sea long after I emptied it.
The plane’s thick windows deadened the colors, muted the indigo depths and foaming waves, changed my perspective so the towering palm trees were the same size as the girl who ran down the street, whose feet fell silently by the side of the road, who never turned to look around but flew like a bird who knew its home and cared not for the strangers who gawked at the colors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MT. KILIMANJARO, Tanzania—I woke in the middle of the first night gasping for breath. There was not enough oxygen in the frigid mountain air. I forced deep, steadying breaths down my throat, sure that I would wake the whole campsite. But the world slept on in the otherwise unaccustomed quiet. Neither crickets nor traffic made their home at 10,000 feet.
The next night the wind rushed fierce and unyielding across our exposed plateau. Dust blew into my nostrils, bored into my fingerprints, settled anywhere it could find purchase. Our dirty clothing hung like prayer scarves from the tent, black shorts here, white shirt there, a disarray of socks on every surface. I gazed in awe at the stars for all of five seconds before the wind drove me back inside, into the burrow of my sleeping bag where I drew two hoods around my head and let the claustrophobic security of a little nylon shell lull me to sleep.
By the third day we were high above the clouds. They stretched to the end of the earth, blocking the entire mountain from view below. The ocean of white swelled and crested in its own patterns, no less elegant for its torpidity. I half expected it to muffle sound and alter vision, but my eyes and ears perceived the world the same as ever.
Heave a breath, cough it out. One foot up, two eyes down. I coached myself up the summit two nights later, my boots sliding over the gravel and every inch of me begging for respite. A glint in the east turned out not to be the long-awaited sun but just lights from town. It was going to be a long hike.
The night passed like a dream, each minute as long as an hour but the whole ordeal compressed in my mind to a fraction of its eight-hour duration. I stood gasping at the summit with a stupid grin plastered on my face, my camera an extension of my arm as I snapped away at the monolithic glaciers and jagged craters now visible under the striking morning sun. My lungs wheezed and sputtered and berated me for making them climb above 19,000 feet with full-blown bronchitis. It was worth it.
We descended the same gravelly dunes we’d scrambled up so recently. The clouds rolled back in after a clear night; we slid down the mountain hour by hour, plunging back toward the rippling white ocean below us. It was a different world up here, harsher and quieter, isolated and exhilarating. Disorientated and deoxygenated, I imagined us swimming fathoms deep in a sky-blue ocean as ships passed above us, unaware.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Is it censorship to vow not to shelve a magazine bearing a cover photo that has ignited controversy in a community still raw from a terrorist attack? Businesses in Harvard Square grappled with that question this week as they decided whether to stock Rolling Stone Magazine’s upcoming issue, which depicts on its cover Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the man charged in the Boston Marathon bombings.
Critics, including Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, have argued that the cover photo glamorizes Tsarnaev as a celebrity. The full-page image, a soft-focused photograph of Tsarnaev that he posted online, teases a long article inside the magazine detailing what sources described as Tsarnaev’s evolution from “a charming kid with a bright future” into a “monster.”
With its cover attracting national attention, the magazine has stood by its editorial decision, saying in an editors’ note that the story “falls within the traditions of journalism.” But a number of businesses have said they will not sell the issue in their stores.
Within Harvard Square and the surrounding area, CVS, Tedeschi Food Shops, and Out of Town News will not shelve the magazine. The Coop, however, will stock the magazine as usual, and the Harvard Library will provide access to the controversial issue both online via database subscriptions and on the shelf in some libraries, Kira Poplowski, the library’s director of communications, wrote in an email.
Businesses that decided not to shelve the issue cited concern that the cover photo could offend patrons and others in the community.
“As a company with deep roots in New England and a strong presence in Boston, we believe this is the right decision out of respect for the victims of the attack and their loved ones,” Michael J. DeAngelis, CVS’ public relations director, wrote in an email. 
Out of Town News, a newsstand near the Harvard Square T-stop, decided Wednesday not to carry the issue in part because it had offended people and attracted notoriety in the news media, according to manager Raj Patel. He said that although some customers have asked about the issue, they have wanted to see the cover because of the controversy but not actually buy it.
But for the Coop, a longstanding policy against censorship trumped concerns about the cover image.
“We think Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is a despicable human being and we do not agree with Rolling Stone Magazine’s decision to feature his picture on their front cover,” Coop general manager Allan E. Powell wrote in an email. “However, the Coop operates in an academic community where it is expected that there will be free expression on any topic, issue or point of view.” 
Powell said that he and Coop President Jerry P. Murphy ’73 met Thursday to discuss how to proceed after receiving two emails from customers, including one Coop member, asking the company not to shelve the next issue of the magazine. They made their final decision, he wrote, in an effort to avoid “bad precedent.”
Tsarnaev, who attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and formerly worked as a lifeguard at a Harvard pool, pleaded not guilty in federal court last week to 30 counts stemming from the April 15 bombings and their aftermath. Among other charges, he is accused of killing four people and using weapons of mass destruction. He could face the death penalty if convicted.

As Cambridge weathers another heat wave, the question on everyone's minds is this: where in Harvard Square can I find cool, delicious relief? Look no further than the Square's increasingly crowded frozen yogurt landscape. Over the next few days, members of The Crimson's summer staff will make a case for the best froyo in the Square. First up: Pinkberry. 
It's been two weeks since the Fourth of July. The grills have cooled, the pitchers have been emptied, and the Pops' last note has long since died away.
But our freedom is still very much alive. And it spans far longer than a single day, even one brimming with such revelry and merriment. I'm here to remind us of that freedom, and of a liberty that all Americans should be proud to pursue:
I'm here to talk to you about Pinkberry.
Let’s first dissect the name: Pink-berry. The colors of this great nation are red, white, and blue—it is no coincidence, I assure you, that red and white combine to give pink, and that blue is the name of a prominent berry. Moreover, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations tells us that the U.S. has far surpassed all other listed nations in blueberry, strawberry, and cranberry production in recent years, and we're consistently in the world's top four producers of raspberries. Pinkberry shouts American dominance to the world with every bite.
Its name, however, is only the start. You're here to hear how it tastes, after all. In short, Pinkberry tastes like freedom, too. While Yogurtland froyo often melts before it even hits your cup, Pinkberry’s consistency stands resolute in the face of fork or spoon. And while judging from its frozen yogurt offerings CVS might as well stand for Concrete Vulgar Solids, Pinkberry never fails to melt in the mouth. Moreover, although J.P. Licks and Lizzy's make froyo in addition to ice cream, their negligible fresh fruit toppings (J.P. Licks uses frozen fruit and Lizzy's only serves fresh strawberries) can rightly be deemed traitorous. Pinkberry, in contrast, provides the perfect blend of choice and practicality, with a wide variety of combinations to satisfy even the most crotchety consumer—but not wide enough, as with Yogurtland, to overwhelm. Spanning the perfect balance of taste, texture, and elegance, Pinkberry takes its place with America on the global (froyo) stage.
The real argument here, however—the reason you’re currently clinging to your seats—is the age-old battle between Berryline and Pinkberry. And, like the Revolutionary War, it has an obvious conclusion. Berryline is the Britain of yogurts: though attempting to be quaint and wholesome, it merits our pity rather than our affection. Berryline’s tasteless décor falls flat in the face of Pinkberry’s colorful modernism. And Berryline’s tasteless toppings don't fare much better, as Pinkberry continues to innovate and surprise each day (try its pomegranate juice and popping boba together for a real treat!). The deciding victory, though, lies in the easy method with which Pinkberry allows its customers to get more Pinkberry: a plastic rewards card that can also be loaded on a mobile app. My sincerest apologies to those who have lost their stone-age paper stamp cards from Berryline.
My country, 'tis of thee. Sweet land of Pinkberry. Of thee, I sing.
