After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the next few years, up to 57,000 inmates may walk free from California’s prisons. On Monday, a panel of federal judges ordered the state to reduce its incarcerated population by up to 40 percent within a two- to three-year period in order to relieve severe overcrowding. The court  stated that overcrowding was the primary reason for what it called “unconstitutional conditions” in California’s prisons—conditions that judges said were so poor that prisoners regularly commit suicide or die from lack of adequate health care. 
This drastic nature of Monday’s ruling underlines the serious practical problems within not only California prisons, but also within our current prison system as a whole. Prisons at around 200 percent capacity—with thousands bunked in hallways and gyms for lack of housing space—cannot possibly provide an acceptable level of medical or mental health care to inmates. In addition to prompting action to reduce overcrowding, we hope that the court order will also be viewed as a call for a more thoughtful, long-term evaluation of our theory of punishment. Strategies such as outsourcing prisoners to other states or privatizing prisons do little to solve the deeper issues that cause overcrowding in the first place—we need a critical examination of the ways in which we deal with those who have broken the law. 
While rising crime rates contribute to a continually growing prison population, the current capacity issue is also a product of problems in our legal system and our conception of punishment. The legal system is designed to penalize those who commit crimes and to decrease the likelihood of persons committing subsequent crimes—for many offenses, the focus should not be on punishment, but on rehabilitation and preventive measures. 
Reforming sentencing policies could go a long way in taking the pressure off crowded prisons. Instead of heading to prison, more inmates could be sent to rehabilitation facilities that would help them prepare to reenter society once their sentences are up, going a long way toward reducing high recidivism rates. It is worthwhile to also consider decriminalizing or at least reducing sentences for many minor crimes, especially nonviolent offenses. Decreasing the number of crimes that apply under three-strike policies—a prominent feature of the California judicial system—could reduce the number of second- and third- strike offenders serving long sentences for petty crimes or technical infractions.
Regardless of what course of action the state of California undertakes, it should do so promptly. California state officials, including the governor, have indicated that they will appeal the mandate, possibly to the Supreme Court, seemingly in contradiction to Governor Schwarzenegger’s 2006 declaration of a state of emergency because of risks found to be associated with severe overcrowding in state prisons. Overburdened prison facilities essentially hand inmates harsher sentences than they deserve, decreasing their likelihood of real rehabilitation and increasing the possibility that these men and women will continue to cycle through the system. While the state may have reason to object to the court order’s imposition of a numerical mandate on prison population reductions, it should take this as an opportunity to make a comprehensive qualitative assessment of the situation in order to make constructive changes.
The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, although it is only the third most populous country—one out of every 100 American adults is currently behind bars. We must continue to scrutinize our judicial and penal system to determine whether justice is being administered fairly and reasonably—making an effort to ensure that punishment fits the crime—and correct any inequalities that cause some groups to be punished disproportionately over others. A modern, civilized nation cannot simply lock people away and forget about them. Good government must concern itself with the welfare of all elements of society, even those that have erred against it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday afternoon in Quincy House, a large audience of Harvard students and faculty was spellbound by a five-foot-tall, 79-year-old mother of 11 children. Dolores Huerta, president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation and co-founder of the United Farm Workers of America—although delicate in appearance—exudes the calm passion and power that distinguishes leaders of her incredible historical stature. The daughter of a waitress and a coal miner, Señora Huerta’s lifelong fight for social justice is, as David G. Hernandez ’09 puts it, a “testament to the power each one of us possesses to make a positive difference.” Her acceptance of the Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian of the Year Award, given by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, is a fitting celebration of increased opportunity for Chicanos, Latinos, women, and workers. It also commends the struggle for equal rights and a better life for all, the struggle for the American dream.
The Humanitarian of the Year Award is presented by the students and faculty of the Harvard Foundation to individuals who have exceptionally contributed to the humanitarian cause and whose works exemplify the mission of the foundation. No one fits that description better than Dolores Huerta. Like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mahatma Gandhi, Dolores Huerta and César Chávez mobilized a massive nonviolent movement that empowered impoverished, abused, and disenfranchised people to fight against injustice. 
Huerta was instrumental in organizing the migrant farm workers of California’s fields and co-founded the UFW in 1962. Later that year she pushed for legislation repealing the inhumane Bracero Program, which legally exploited the labor of Mexican nationals. In 1965, she directed the UFW’s national grape boycott, which communicated the worker’s suffering to the consumers in order to end subhuman wages, worker abuses, poor living conditions, and the use of toxic pesticides, among other atrocities. Her efforts culminated in a three-year collective bargaining between the UFW and the entire California grape industry in 1970, a monumental and unprecedented triumph.
Since then, Huerta has not ceased to selflessly serve the disadvantaged of America and the wider world. As she spoke at the podium on Monday, clad in purple, a customary symbol of the grape boycott, one could not help but admire her rare yet perfect combination of joyful charisma, fearlessness, and selflessness. She has been arrested 22 times for participating in non-violent civil disobedience strikes, but she still wears a smile that shines with hope, promise, and opportunity.     

Opportunity is exactly what she has given to both migrant and nonmigrant Latinos in the United States. The families and communities of many Latinos at Harvard have been directly affected by the work of Dolores Huerta. At Harvard, we call it a Latino community. At home we may call it something different, but no matter what it is called Dolores Huerta has always represented a community of hardworking people. In her ongoing fight to improve living conditions and treatment for laborers, Huerta represents the family who spent days in the fields under the scorching sun with no place to use the restroom or drink clean water.  She represents the mother who labored tirelessly to send her children to school and the child who saw the pain and suffering of the family. She represents the generations who fought hard so that one day their children and children’s children could be in a better position to help the world in their own right.

Her contribution to equal opportunity for women and Latinas in particular deserves special recognition. Huerta enacted social change at a time when female labor leaders were not treated with equality or even respect. Her work with the UFW and more recently as a board member of the Feminist Majority Foundation has empowered women of color across the country. She has improved the lives of thousands of women who may never have the chance to meet her—as many Harvard Latinas did on Monday—but who owe her an insurmountable debt, a debt that should be paid by a continued commitment to social justice and human rights. 

In her speech on Monday, Huerta echoed the importance of continuing “La Causa”: our work is not yet done. Workers are still being mistreated and underpaid, and the voices of minorities and women are still being marginalized. Fittingly, she ended her speech with two rallying cries for solidarity. The first was a Zulu cry, “Wozani!” (“People together!”), often used in the struggle to end apartheid in South Africa. The second was the traditional UFW chant: “¡Sí Se Puede!” This cry was eventually translated into “Yes, We Can!”, the slogan of President Obama’s 2008 campaign. 
There is, indeed, much work left to be done. Thankfully, we all have a model, a lucerito to follow, in the celebrated person of Dolores Huerta.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty years from now, when I think about Harvard on Election Night 2008, what I’ll remember is a hundreds-strong crowd of students shouting and dancing, turning to and embracing their friends in one massive, mutual celebration. The festivities, of course, were partisan, but I also like to think that the scene, and the election in general, represented a potential that is nonpartisan—an investment in and excitement about government that I personally had never experienced before and had rarely witnessed among my peers. 

As the Obama administration turns to the difficult tasks of governance and students turn their minds to daily, more immediate concerns, it is our responsibility to make sure that this initial enthusiasm doesn’t dissipate without leaving behind a lasting monument. The creation of a U.S. Public Service Academy can be our generation’s contribution, an institution that embodies our “call to service.” 

The USPSA is a civilian counterpart to our military academies. But, instead of military officers, the academy will admit America’s best and brightest students and eventually produce an entire generation of effective and efficient leaders in local, state, and national government. Via a competitive admissions process akin to the military academies—where admissions rates can be lower than Harvard’s—students would earn a four-year scholarship to study liberal arts as well as a specific public service field. At its full capacity, the academy would serve approximately 5000 students a year; upon graduation, these students will fulfill a five-year service requirement in areas of critical need: teaching in a rural school in Mississippi, for instance, or working for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

Simultaneously, our generation has shown interest in public service: A 2008 poll by Social Sphere Strategies shows that young people aged 18 to 29 supported the creation of the U.S. Public Service Academy by a margin of more than seven to one.  Yet study after study has demonstrated that students are being priced out of public service by expensive undergraduate and graduate educations or turned off by the declining prestige of working in government. A study by the Financial Times, for example, found that even at programs like Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, where service-oriented careers are emphasized, the percentage of graduates who enter public service following graduation has dropped by half in just one generation.  In Harvard’s Class of 2008, OCS’s senior survey results indicate that just two percent of seniors are employed in government at graduation.  

Of course, students need not serve directly in government to be conscientious citizens. There are many venues by which students have already embraced and are enthusiastically answering the call to service: Interest in nonprofit careers and programs such as Teach for America has steadily increased at Harvard in past years. But all conscientious citizens, regardless of their personal and career choices, must also recognize that recruiting motivated and talented public servants is critical to the efficiency and effectiveness of our government. 
And that is part of the beauty of a national public service academy: Students who do not apply or attend will still understand the significance inherent in its establishment. By creating an American institution devoted entirely to public service, the government sends the message that public service is important to the country and is a worthy investment. By supporting the creation of the academy, students demonstrate their belief in better government.   

Scholarship programs or financial aid incentives that encourage public service, while important, fail to send as clear and salient a message: that public service is a priority not only for the select few who are interested in or even aware of these programs, but also for every American citizen.  
The national public service academy was first championed by George Washington. Retired from his own stint of government service, and living out his days at Mt. Vernon, he still regaled visitors with a plan for a national college that would train America’s future government leaders. The idea was recorded in his will but never came to fruition. Now is the time to fulfill Washington’s original call to service.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forget this summer—I’m hung up on my plans for next January. Nearly two years after Harvard’s administration approved calendar reform for the 2009-2010 academic year, students remain in the dark about the mysterious “J-term.” The creation of a J-term itself should be commended; many promising break options lie outside Cambridge, allowing students to work or travel over the four-week period. But, as the university puts its finishing touches on the schedule, it must remember to furnish offerings for the rest of us as well—those who lack the resources or the desire to set up shop elsewhere. 

The best bet is January classes, though these offerings should not bear any resemblance to what’s currently in the course catalog. The shorter January should offer lessons in the general life skills that we bookworms have so often missed—a wood-shop class, for instance—or academic takes on our hobbies and amusements, like deciphering the true meaning of rap lyrics. But the most effective way for the College to remove all semblance of a Harvard J-term to actual school (and therefore drudgery) is to ask its students to serve as teachers.
Have a famous campus sex blogger lead a course on sex, dating, and what men or women want. Get one of our football players to pontificate for three weeks about the rules and strategies of the gridiron. The novelty would entice prospective teachers and curious extracurricular learners alike—not to mention set Harvard University apart in yet another way.

A student-run class wouldn’t automatically be inferior. As self-congratulating as it may seem, this is, after all, Harvard—many of our kids have already distinguished themselves in some field or skill set, often to the point of international recognition. On campus, too, presidents and editors-in-chief of student groups do not face legitimacy problems. They acquire their expertise with only a few years’ experience, yet they are often highly successful and respected.
With approval of student-taught classes firmly in their hands, administrators can veto any prospective educator who does not meet the same standard. Students interested in teaching their own seminars would apply to the administration in advance, with syllabi and lesson plans at the ready. They would have to answer tough questions about what qualifies them to teach the course, and they would have to interview to prove their mettle as a teacher. Finally, the course would automatically be graded pass/fail, keeping students’ GPAs out of the hands of their peers.

And to skeptical students—these courses would bear more resemblance to your favorite extracurricular than to your Lit and Arts A Core. The quirky subject matter would bring students of similar interests together and create some fast friendships. The (lack of) age difference would erase much of the resentful divide between teacher and student, leading to discussion seminars that are truly group-driven, not individual-driven, as too many fall and spring sections are. Finally, students would be no less likely to write a final paper for a peer than for a professor. We do far more work for our pet student groups out of choice—often with nothing in return but personal satisfaction.

Here’s an argument for University Hall: Far from relinquishing pedagogical control, this idea would add a new dimension to a Harvard education. We all know our students are smart, but it’s less automatic that they know how to effectively pass on their smarts to others. With a real need for talented teachers out there in the real world, this idea will expose at least a few soon-to-be grads to real-life experience in a noble profession.
There is a reason that students often seem more invested and interested in their extracurriculars than in their academics. This (admittedly revolutionary) idea is one way for Harvard to harness that for its own J-term innovation. The kids in those admissions videos are right: Despite having some pretty high-quality classroom instruction, we do learn the most from our fellow students.

If you’ve ever wondered whether that guy in the Delphic could give you anything other than an STD, think again: he could be the golden ticket to your next “A.” According to the description of a new course, Sociology 43: “Social Interaction,” students will learn about the “sociology of everyday life,” and turn in a journal containing observations about their social lives for a grade. The course is taught by Timothy Nelson, a lecturer in the sociology department, whose course Web site boasts that “the University’s resident halls, classrooms, finals [sic] clubs, and the cities of Cambridge and Boston will serve as our laboratory.” Though final clubs and their supposed elitist nature are often controversial, Nelson said he does not believe they are problematic in an academic setting. He said that many students wrote about final clubs in their journal entries for Sociology 155: “Class and Culture,” a course he taught in the fall. “Some people in [final clubs] wrote that the major benefit was networking for internships or jobs after school. Most wanted to disavow the fact that they were exclusive,” Nelson said. Students in the course don’t seem to dwell on the inclusion of final clubs. “I think that the listing of final clubs was just trying to utilize the spaces within the Harvard community,” said Ryan W. Taney ’09, who is currently enrolled in the class. “I’m sure he was giving us the opportunity to use that as a sociological setting.” Students hoping to read the classic anti-club manifesto “Privileged: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class” and hate on the Harvard establishment, should wait to take Nelson’s “Class and Culture” course next fall. But for anyone who’s ever wished they could do homework while partying at the Fly, Harvard has finally invented the perfect class.

On Monday, January 19, 2009, in the quiet car of an Amtrak train from Penn Station to Union Station, I claimed a seat beside three women traveling together. They offered me homemade cake and a stick of gum while they chatted and sipped mini-bottles of white wine from the café car.Through the train’s windows, we watched the American cityscapes and countrysides fly by. I knew I had to go. Especially when I found out that I would finish finals the Saturday before he was to be sworn in. But despite my long-standing resolution to be there in person to hear this extraordinary orator, the new leader of our country, I failed to make any set travel arrangements—and it was just days before the inauguration would take place. I figured that between bus, train, and plane, I would be able to find some way of getting to the nation’s capital. But on Sunday, a huge snow storm hit my hometown of New York, blanketing the city in a layer of white.Luckily, when I checked, they had added some last minute trains between New York and Washington. And with all that snow, I figured the train would be the safest bet. I’d arrive by Monday evening.  When I stepped off of my train, Union Station was swarming with people, completely transformed from the last and only time I had ever been in Washington, D.C., four years ago. It was 9:40 PM, and the place was a hub of activity: women in floor-length coats, college-age kids milling around, and swarms of police guarding gates.  I had made it. I had packed up my room at Harvard two days before, spent less than 24 hours at home, and now had made my dream of being in Washington D.C. to see this inauguration come true.

Before Facebook, there was TheSpark; and before Mark Zuckerberg, there was a posse of Harvard Grads carving out a crimson corner on the Web. Sam A. Yagan ’99 and the other founders of SparkNotes have struck gold again with OkCupid.com, an online dating site for the younger set. FM sat down with the seasoned Web savant just in time for Valentine’s Day.

1. 
Fifteen Minutes (FM): You were an applied math concentrator here at Harvard—did you envision yourself going into the Internet world while studying here?  
Sam Yagan: I started my first company while I was a senior on campus. When I started at Harvard I definitely did ultimately envision myself being an Internet entrepreneur, I just didn’t realize to what extent.

2.
FM: You’re also the founder of SparkNotes, for which we all thank you very much. How did you come up with that idea?
SY: A couple of my classmates and I had been toying with Internet ideas, and we decided we wanted to do something more substantial. So we thought ‘what’s popular with students?’ and basically everyone used CliffsNotes. But they had some real flaws. We realized we’re at Harvard with all these awesome English majors—for example, the person who wrote the SparkNotes on Moby Dick wrote a summa thesis on Moby Dick, so it’s definitely one of the best study guides on Moby Dick on the planet. According to the Wall Street Journal, we had more Harvard grads working for us in ’99 than any other company in the world.
3.
FM: How did you transition from SparkNotes into the world of online dating sites?
SY: After we sold SparkNotes to Barnes and Noble, we were like, well, the model of taking a product that exists that people pay for, and making it free and making it better, is a real powerful combo. So we thought ‘What other verticals can we enter with that model?’ The only three things people were paying for online were porno, gambling, and dating. We canceled out the first two—I am married after all—but we thought that dating would be a great venue for excitement, and we could definitely come up with a better Web site than Match.com. We made it really fun, and free.
4. 
FM:You paid Harvard undergrads to write SparkNotes at first. How much did you pay them? Do you still use Harvard undergrads?
SY: While I was working there it was $300-$500 per SparkNote. It depended—Ulysses was probably a little more. After we sold to B&N it went up a little. I believe they don’t really do a lot of new Spark Notes, and I don’t think they still use undergrads, sorry.
5. FM:  How was your love life while attending Harvard?SY: We were all math majors, and all super analytical. We definitely weren’t dating experts. We just observed what it was in life that drew people together and made them click, and our approach of observing how people date in the world allowed us to transfer those observations into an online Web site. How they decide whom they like, where they go on dates—we try to transfer this online. 6.FM: Do you feel like the Harvard dating scene helped or hindered you for the real world?SY: Our approach is much more about modeling the real world on the Web rather than using the dating expertise we learned, but I wouldn’t say it was the awesome Harvard dating scene that influenced us to start up the Web site.7.FM: Specifically, did you create OkCupid to find some romance for yourself?SY: We were all married, but our employees definitely use it a lot. “I work for OkCupid” is definitely a great pickup line, and apparently the chicks love it.   8.FM: How can you afford to do a free dating site? And why not charge monthly fees like all the others do?SY: We have 15 employees, while Match.com, etc. have about 300. Although we have a fraction of their workers we have an equally good Web site.9.FM: A lot of the Web site seems to have pink and purple lettering. Is this to lure more females into the dating realm?SY: Any dating site, just like a nightclub or bar, you always want to attract the women, because wherever the women are, men will surely follow. Indeed, we have a higher portion of women on our Web site than others: we’re 1:1 while most are 2:1 male to female.10.FM: Who is the average OkCupid.com user? Male/female? Age?SY: If you’re under 30, you probably don’t pay for any sites, from dating to music. In your 40’s or 50’s, you go to what you see advertised. So most of our users are under 30, a little more Web savvy than most, equal male to female, and on the whole a little geekier than your sort of mass-market Web site. You have to think a little, answer questions, etc.   11. FM: Have you attended any weddings of successful OkCupid users? SY:We get invitations all the time, we even get users who ask us to pay for their weddings, which is a little surprising. But no, I have not personally gone to any weddings.12.FM: How successful is your Web site in relation to other Web sites?SY: The fact that we’ve gotten to be almost as big as Match.com, who spend $100 million a year on advertising and we spend $0, to me, shows we’re pretty successful. FM: Any new ventures in the future?SY: We’re committed to becoming the biggest dating Web site on the web. Overthrowing Match.com is our job.13.FM: What advice would you give to Harvard students looking for love on the Web?SY: Use the Web just like you use the Web for everything else in your life, thus use it as part of your overall strategy. Don’t only use the Web to find people, and don’t never use it. Meet some people who aren’t in the Harvard community, and it’s a great opportunity to meet people on other campuses, etc. But you should also be going to parties and meeting people the good old-fashioned way, staying inside on a Friday web-surfing isn’t the best recommendation.14. FM:What are your thoughts on the current hookup culture among college campuses? Does it help or hinder your business?SY: It makes online dating more useful because you can look for any type of relationship you want, from a hookup to marriage. So its easier than figuring out what the other person wants down the line—in this format, you know up front. 15. FM:  I read that Boston is the biggest city that uses the Web site, per capita. Why do you think Bostonians are turning to the web for love? No skills on the streets?SY: Not at all—I think it’s because Bostonions tend to be pretty Web savvy. They’re young, single, and technologically savvy. Imagine San Antonio, not a super young or wired population, where you wouldn’t have a huge Internet culture. It also helps that it’s so cold, because you can be like “it’s a little cold, why don’t we stay in and find love online?”

Against all odds, my friends and I somehow managed to land tickets to Barack Obama’s inauguration.  But while our silver-section admission granted us a closer view than millions of Obama fans teeming on the National Mall, we were still in the most plebeian of ticketed areas.  If we wanted the best possible spot, we were going to have to battle with 140,000 other early risers.  And unbeknownst to us, we were also going to have to tolerate appalling police incompetence.And so late at night on January 19, I put on three pairs of pants, grabbed our precious, fancy-looking tickets and some American flags, and we hit the road.  When multiple detours finally brought us to our section’s entrance at 3:30 a.m., we found a very civil, self-policed line of 60 or so friendly people bundled in coats and sleeping bags.By 4:30 a.m; the situation had devolved into mayhem.  A few impromptu community organizers and I attempted to maintain our nice single-file line, but the surprisingly rude police officers refused to help.  Thousands of people arrived from public transportation and crowded into a mass of hopeful yet frustrated pilgrims, interspersed with officers yelling conflicting information about which section of the crowd would be admitted first.After lurching forward in the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd, my friends and I took turns resting by sitting down on the permafrost in a bizarre forest of legs as the sky began to lighten.  After a one second frisking, Transportation Security Administration officials eventually let us through.  I could easily have carried a weapon onto the Mall.Luckily, we managed to snag the best front -row spots in our section. Things were looking up as the sun rose on the first day of Obama’s presidency.  The poorly-controlled crowd, however, had something else in mind. There were no longer any police officers in sight, and eventually the brewing mob mentality was set off by a few selfish fence-jumpers.  Our entire section flooded forward over a flimsy three-foot plastic barrier and into a handicapped section, blocking the views of disabled people and ruining our hard earned vantage point.  By the time our new president appeared in the distance, we were freezing and exhausted.  After the spell of his booming inaugural address was broken, we passed miles of street vendors selling Barack Obama Hot Sauce between the Mall and our hotel room, where we eventually collapsed, sleeping through the parade on TV.The historical value of hearing Obama’s inaugural address in person can never be taken away from me. The experience was epic, emotional, and quintessentially American.  But I learned something else that Tuesday–about why the market needs to be regulated and why you need barriers at a Girl Talk concert.  People may be honorable individually or in small groups, but without stern and threatening enforcement, you just can’t trust a mob.  By failing to present more than a sparse, disorganized police force, the committee planning this inauguration put far too much faith in the goodwill of this crowd.

9:15 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., On the National Mall, near the Washington Monument.I didn’t really have to piss, I just went with Nick because I thought it would be a good idea to get it out of the way before the crowds really hit, before it would be impossible to get there. And I didn’t want him to go alone. At 10:00, it wasn’t that crowded on the hill in front of the Washington Monument—we had enough space to sit down—but all the same, there were a lot of people and not much to distinguish one crowd of bundled-up onlookers from another. So I left our comfortable plot and headed toward the portables. We ended up five feet from the portables, but there was no way we were getting to them. Elevated flower beds, chain-rope fences denoting what-were-usually-walkways, and the placement of the facilites in question, had transformed the field into a corral. People were crammed against the sides of the bathrooms, some scrambling to escape the crush by climbing on top (to greater or lesser success), but most were pushing back against the incoming waves of would-be-pee-ers and the had-been-shoved.We were packed so tightly, caught between the pressure of the cripple falling back into us and of the chain behind us, that I couldn’t raise my hand to wipe my nose. People were angry. They pushed at us. “What are you doing blocking me hun?” “We were here first!” “You’re going to have to move.” We apologized, said we were trapped, bowed our heads.Not five minutes after we got ensnared in the portable toilets pen, did we hear a woman’s voice pierce the general hubbub of the crowd, screaming, “Makay! Makay! Has anyone seen my baby? Answer your mama, Makay!” Next to me, pushing through the crowd, a red-lipsticked brown face emerged, streaming with tears, eyes panicked, sound coming from her in short gasps, “Makay! Makay! Makay! Where are you? Your mama’s calling!” She pushed on in front of us to shouts of  “Make way! Make way! She’s looking for her kid!” Nick and I looked at one another and agreed that, despite the meaningful occasion, this was no place for children.

When I committed to staying up all night, to getting to the Mall earlier than anyone else, I didn’t know it would be below ten degrees in Washington D.C. Yet the most jarring experience of the morning was not the cold, nor the fact that I wasn’t alone waiting at 4:30 a.m.. It was the sea of humanity surrounding me. Every race, color, creed, and age had come to lend support.My friends and I ran to the Mall, arms outstretched, breathing it all in, while singing whatever we wanted—“My Country ’Tis of Thee,” “America, the Beautiful,” and “America, F*** Yeah.” A group of older black women offered us hot chocolate because they liked that we were singing. To our right, a middle-aged couple from Seattle sat smiling. It was their first time in Washington, first time in a crowd this large, they said. I was with my girlfriend, whom I met almost a year ago in Cairo. I held her close as he spoke of the Muslim world:“To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society’s ills on the West—know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.”We cheered with the crowd. I kissed her cheek. “This is the price and promise of citizenship.”A young black man was in front of me with his friends. At the end of the speech, we hug. I don’t even know him, and never will speak with him again. We just say, “Obama, man, Obama.”From the Mall, the sea of humanity dispersed, returning to our jobs, our schools, our lives.

My roommate, Mariah, and I were late—we were running down G Street [in Northwest D.C.] to meet my  parents, who had been waiting to drive us to my dad’s office on Capitol Hill.
Initially, my four roommates and I were slated to spend the night there, wake up at a leisurely hour, and then stroll to the National Mall four blocks away in time for Barack Obama’s inauguration at noon. Of course, this plan grossly underestimated the impact of 1.8 million people on the Mall. Instead, our “stroll” became a two-hour trek, over the freeway, past the Purple Tunnel of Doom, climbing barriers, and getting crushed in the masses. But we had our moments: every now and then, someone would stand on a wall and yell “Give me an ‘O’” and the crowd would respond with a rousing “Ooooooooooo.” Or a nice elderly woman would move aside to give me a better view of the Jumbotron. Or the fat guy squishing me against a hot dog stand would turn around and compliment me on my four Obama buttons. I couldn’t imagine a nicer mob.
It was a trip of glimpses. We climbed on each others’ toes to glimpse Beyoncé through binoculars at the Lincoln Memorial We Are One concert. We glimpsed Obama’s official portrait in the packed lobby of the National Portrait Gallery. We glimpsed Bush’s helicopter fly over the crowd as he departed from the District. We glimpsed the greatest political leaders in America over the tops of people’s hats on a screen at the Mall. But the most exciting glimpse of all happened the night before the inauguration, when Mariah and I ran down G Street. 
We were held up by police at a corner, and while we bounced on our toes impatiently, a motorcade turned past us. Inside a black Escalade sat the new first family. They waved. We waved. And as the car drove onwards, bound for the Miley Cyrus concert, everyone on the corner hugged each other in shock, laughing and crying and screaming, “I can’t believe it!” 
Some people criticize Obama for being a celebrity politician, but nothing has excited me this much since I was 11 years old and the Spice Girls came to town. And I have to say, that gives me hope.

On a November night in 1964—just as the sun was rising outside Leverett’s McKinlock Hall—the fire alarm blared, and William P. Docken ’67 went to check on his roommate, Gregory B. Craig ’67. Surprisingly, Craig was still lying in the bottom bunk. 
“Greg has the alarm clock in his hand, banging the shit out of it trying to make it stop,” says Docken, “This is the guy who President Obama’s gonna wake up in the middle of  the night when he’s in the middle of a crisis.”
Though he may have appeared to be lethargic and confused in this particular episode, Craig, the current White House Counsel to President Barack H. Obama, was characterized by his energy and cordiality on Harvard’s campus. Appointed to Obama’s staff in November 2008, Craig has long been a political force, something that began to take shape in his undergraduate years. Through artistic and political endeavors, Craig demonstrated a sociability that he would carry with him to his office in the West Wing.
HAVING A (TENOR) VOICE ON CAMPUS
Upon arriving at Harvard fresh from Phillips Exeter Academy, Craig became a popular figure around campus, acquiring friends and acquaintances easily with his genuine, upbeat demeanor. “[The room] phone was constantly ringing, and we only had one phone line in the room. We were all waiting for calls from our girlfriends, but 90 percent of the time, the phone line was for Greg,” recalls Richard E. Hammond `67, one of Craig’s Leverett roommates.
Craig carried his energy wherever he went, taking his vocal talent to the stage as a member of the Krokodiloes, Harvard’s oldest all-male acappella group. “I remember when he tried out at the time, he had this most angelic face, and we all just loved his voice,” says Kenneth M. Kastleman ’66, who sang with Craig. “He was certainly the most handsome of us. Apologies to the rest of the Kroks of that era.”
Despite the fact that Harvard was still a stringently academic, all-male institution, the Krokodiloes allowed Craig to squeeze in some fun. “We sang at as many women’s colleges as possible,” says Kastleman. “It was always the case that a large coterie of girls would crowd around Craig after a performance. To his credit, he was always incredibly gentlemanly, and had no intention of taking advantage of those situations.”
His popularity not only achieved applause at Krok performances from his many admirers—it also connected him to faculty and fellow students.
INSPIRED INTELLECTUALISM
Craig devoted his energy to issues beyond hitting the high notes. “He was also a very serious person,” says Hammond. “In those days, he was further ahead than a lot of us were in looking seriously at the political, international, economic, and human rights issues that confronted America.” 
Driven by this intellectualism, Craig developed good relations with the Harvard faculty, holding forums and meeting with them personally. “He had a very active faculty engagement, with Barney Frank, and Henry Kissinger, and Harold Burbank,” says Hammond. “Most of the undergrads were quite shy about putting their intellect at risk in conversation with faculty, but Greg simply went out and engaged them.”
Craig proved to be a stellar student, displaying the conscientiousness and academic dedication that has characterized his professional career as a lawyer and politician. A history concentrator who graduated Phi Beta Kappa, Craig learned quickly how to separate work from fun and received the Lionel De Jersey Fellowship to study at Cambridge University. 
“[He was] very focused. Very focused,” says Docken. “Somehow he had a key to some room in Leverett House in the towers—I’m not sure how he got it—but if he had a paper or something due, he’d be down in that room, hacking away at the typewriter.” 
It was in that secret room that Craig composed his senior thesis on writer Upton Sinclair’s campaign to use the California Democratic Party for implementing socialist reforms during the Great Depression. “It is certainly an illustrious choice of a thesis for someone who ended up doing what he does now,” says Docken.
Indeed, Craig’s combination of amiability and intellectual perspective culminated his senior year, with his election as Chairman of the Harvard Undergraduate Council. As Chairman, Craig demonstrated his leadership and communicative ability on both on a campus-wide and national levels. Craig loosened a strict campus with parietal extensions and oversaw the creation of an informal freshman advising system. “He used his leadership of the UC to create a forum, not just addressing student government issues, but also sponsoring things like American policy in Vietnam,” says Hammond. “He used that forum and leadership post to bring speakers to Harvard and that led to policy discussions and debates for the student body.”
Craig levied his student leadership to address the nation’s salient issue of the time: the Vietnam War. Along with prominent anti-war politician Allard K. Lowenstein, Craig helped organize a letter to President Lyndon B. Johnson from student leaders representing over 100 U.S. colleges that protested the war in Vietnam. They questioned the purpose, tactics, and media coverage of the war, along with the draft. The letter stirred up national attention after it appeared on the front-page of The New York Times in December of 1966.
According to Docken, the qualities that makes Craig a prominent representative of the Democratic left in Washington politics emerged during these accomplishments in his junior and senior years at Harvard.
SINGING A NEW TUNE
No longer in the Harvard spotlight, the nation will now likely see the renowned tenacity from Craig as he helps guide the Obama administration. Although Craig’s days of hammering away at typewriters in Leverett Towers are far behind him, old classmates say they recognize the same energetic, good-humored, and ingenuous Craig on television as White House Counsel that they knew in college.
“He possessed that intellectual spirit, even as a young guy, to identify a public value, and go to work in it. He figured out how to give it bearing, and push it ahead,” says Hammond. “And I think that’s been a hallmark of his career, where he’s practiced that in a variety of forms, whether in courtrooms, in international forums, in Congress, or on the floor of the Senate.”

In the trivia game known as “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,” the object is to start with a random actor, link to one of that actor’s co-stars, and then—in only five more steps—get to the ubiquitous actor Kevin Bacon. In 2007, two Vanderbilt professors set out to find Bacon’s legal scholar analogue: someone famous who collaborates often in a variety of genres and who gives no sign of slowing down anytime soon. The man they selected is today’s most frequently cited legal scholar in America, the author of over 500 works including more than 15 books, a constitutional law expert whose interests range from how public policy can improve one’s life to how the online coalescence of like-minded groups can stifle dialogue and undermine democracy. He is Cass R. Sunstein ’75, President Barack H. Obama’s nominee for the head of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, informally known as the regulatory czar. Under the new administration, Sunstein will have the task of supervising regulations from health care to the environment. From the moment that Sunstein entered the Middlesex School, a preparatory school in Concord, Mass., in eighth grade, he seemed destined to excel in all aspects of student life. By his senior year, he was co-editor of the student newspaper, The Anvil, editor-in-chief of the yearbook, and a national-caliber squash player, having learned to play while at the school.Middlesex classmate Robert E. Harvey recalls that Sunstein “was working so much that he wasn’t hanging out with an awful lot of people all the time.” Sunstein’s closest friend at Middlesex, Craig B. McArdle ’75, recalls the day before their graduation, when he asked Sunstein to play squash with him. He said that while sitting at his typewriter in his magazine-strewn room, Sunstein refused, declaring, “too much play and too little work makes Cass a dull boy.”According to McArdle, such occurrences were common, especially during Sunstein’s years as an upperclassman when he decided to focus on writing. “He had this weird thing where he’d be hunched over the typewriter kind of like Glenn Gould over the piano,” says McArdle. “He’d type with one finger on each hand, incredibly fast. He’d just be concentrating, so focused, it was like somebody watching TV. You’d have to say [his name] several times to get his attention.”After graduating with Middlesex’s highest honors, Sunstein brought his intellectual curiosity and his Advanced Placement credits to Harvard in the fall of 1972, where he set out on an Advanced Standing track in English. A Currier resident, Sunstein belonged to the Hasty Pudding and the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.Kurt E. Andersen ’76, a novelist, political writer, and former ’Poon editor, remembers Sunstein as “a dry and funny writer,” with “a kind of rigor in his work not true of everybody then or now.” Despite Sunstein’s humor, the castle never quite became his natural home. “He always seemed to me slightly abashed at the entire Lampoon thing,” says Andersen about the teetotaling undergrad. “I had a sense that he didn’t quite know what he was getting into.”One area of undergraduate life that Sunstein seemed not to struggle with was romance. According to McArdle, most Middlesex graduates entered college with a distinct uneasiness around the opposite sex, but Sunstein managed to overcome this with his natural charms. McArdle recalls that Sunstein was “in many ways...kind of a chick magnet because he had this very innocent look and was bright.”It was not until his third and senior year at Harvard that he decided to enter law school instead of pursuing English graduate work, Sunstein said in a 2008 interview with Fifteen Minutes. “I thought that law would have more opportunities and that you could take a lot of different paths if you went into law,” he said.Despite his busy schedule, Sunstein remained well-known and well-liked by his classmates. “He was a very, very hard worker,” says Hugh C. Fortmiller, Jr. ’56, Sunstein’s English teacher and senior year academic advisor, “but he also had time to be a friend and an amusing conversationalist ... but he had a hell of a lot of responsibilities.”Upon graduation from Harvard Law School in 1978, Sunstein clerked for Thurgood Marshall and later became a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, where he befriended Obama. Last year he left the University of Chicago to return to Cambridge and took up a post advising Obama during his presidential campaign.  David A. Schkade, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, says he marveled at Sunstein’s work ethic, having worked with him to study the unpredictability of punitive damages in legal cases. “We’d have a conversation on Thursday and by Saturday night there’d be a 15-page draft in an e-mail,” he said.One thing that has remained constant in Sunstein’s life is his love of squash. In 2008, Sunstein said that he played three to four times per week. The sport gave him chances to learn the power of colorful analogy from legendary coach Jack Barnaby ’32, to predict other players’ moves, and, in Sunstein’s first year at HLS, to achieve national supremacy by upsetting what then-assistant-coach David R. Fish ’72 called a “juggernaut of a Princeton team.”Despite his cross-disciplinary excellence, Sunstein seems to generate goodwill among his colleagues and even his competitors. Harvey amicably recalls coming in second to Sunstein in the election for yearbook editor at Middlesex. “I’m very amused by that,” Harvey says, “because I’m not the second-most cited law professor in the United States.”

There were pink Post-its on all the glass windows. “Window 21” was scribbled on the one I approached, while my brother Nick stood at “Window 20” to the left, and my friend Rebecca at “Window 22” on my right. If I hadn’t known better, I would’ve thought a small child had gone around sticking these on for fun, but we had been strictly advised in an e-mail: “There are a total of 26 windows pre-approved by the Secret Service to be open for viewing for our floor. All other windows MUST have the shades CLOSED at all times. Please don’t open and close any shades from the approved 26 windows while the parade takes place. This will alarm the Secret Service Snipers allocated on neighboring buildings.” I began to ask the woman who had escorted us into the building, “So, just to be clear, you mean, like, if I open the shade on one of those windows over there–” “–you run the risk of being shot,” she interrupted. “Alrighty then.” We were on the 15th floor of the Citibank building, overlooking the parade route. Directly below “Window 21” we saw Pennsylvania Avenue, lined with police officers from all over the country, heading towards the Capitol in one direction and stretching back towards the White House in the other. For over two hours we had maneuvered our way through throngs of people fighting to get a spot along the parade route or amidst the chaos of the Mall. It was bitterly cold outside, and security consisted of four officers attempting to hand-check the bags of thousands of people. But the excitement was palpable. The pushing and shoving and complaining all suddenly ceased when a camera crew arrived on scene, and, within seconds, everyone in the crowd began to chant “Obama” and flaunt their paraphernalia: posters, pins, shirts, rhinestoned beanies, earrings—you name it. Mustering up just enough energy in our face muscles to fight the cold, Nick, Rebecca, and I turned to each other with beaming smiles that said: “This is what we came for.”We had thrown ourselves headfirst into the epicenter of Inauguration madness. Streets were closed. Newsstands were indistinguishable from vendors of Obama merchandise. Burger joints served “Eggnoguration”-flavored shakes. Given the extent of Obamamania, we had been surprised the night before when the restaurant we had gone to served no such drink as “The Obama.” Street vendors sold Obama condoms, but this overflowing eatery hadn’t thought to create a celebratory cocktail? Unacceptable. “If you come up with one, and it’s good, we’ll put it on the menu,” our waiter told us. Or rather, challenged us. As it turns out, he had told the bartender to come up with a rival concoction, and he would decide the winner based on a random taste test among other customers. After a few minutes of brainstorming, we called our waiter over.“Here you have it,” we told him. “The Obama: Kahlua, Vodka, Baileys, and coconut liqueur, served over ice. Kahlua for his black side, Vodka for his white side, Baileys for the mix, and coconut liqueur for his Hawaiian heritage.” He gave our recipe to the bartender, and the taste test ensued. The verdict? Against all odds, team inexperienced beat out team bartender, and “The Obama” was introduced to the masses. Yes we can.  While it was quite the experience wading through thousands of die-hard Obama fans to get to the Citibank building, Nick, Rebecca, and I felt we had the best of both worlds when we took refuge inside of it. We could go down to street level for a taste of the craziness, and we could go up to the rooftop (where Secret Service Snipers patrolled with binoculars) for a bird’s-eye view, but we could also watch TV within the warm confines of the 15th floor and actually hear the speech and the rest of the ceremony. When NBC announced that the motorcade was leaving the White House for the Capitol, we waited by “Window 21” and watched it pass below. When it announced that the helicopter was carrying Bush away, we got on the rooftop as it circled around the Washington Monument. When it announced that the parade had begun, we hurried down the elevator and saw the Obamas walk alongside their car.After the presidential pair passed us by, we raced to fight through the crowds once again, throw on black-tie attire, and make it on time to New Jersey’s inaugural ball (the “Garden State Inaugural Gala”). Obama went in and out of several balls, but he stayed at ours the whole time. I tried to leave with him at the end, but to my dismay, New Jersey had other plans for the life-size cardboard cutout.

America saw its first Asian American mayor in San Jose, California in 1971, just a year after Kennedy School alum Sam Yoon was born in Seoul, South Korea. In November 2005, Yoon was elected a city councilor at-large—making him the first Asian American elected to office in Boston, in addition to the only Asian American to ever run for public office in the city. Now, Yoon has announced his intention to run for mayor of Boston against incumbent Thomas M. Menino, the longest-serving mayor in the city’s history.“I think the city desperately needs change, and not the kind of change around the edges but a kind of fundamental systemic change,” Yoon said in a December interview. “There is only one way to accomplish that: by changing leadership.”Menino, who was first elected mayor in 1993, has served four terms thus far. His biggest potential challenge in the upcoming race will likely be city councilor and former city council president Michael F. Flaherty, who officially announced his intention to run in late January. South End businessman Kevin McCrea will also be joining the race. Yoon faces a number of obstacles in his campaign. In addition to being a political and cultural outsider in city politics, his fundraising—which has occurred mostly out of state—totals only about $140,000 to date, about a tenth of Menino’s available money. “It’s not explicit, but I’m still seen as someone who is kind of outside the dominant culture here at City Hall,” Yoon said. “It’s a mix of my background but also kind of the way I think.”Susan Y. Yao ’09-’10, a Boston-area resident who worked as in intern in the press office of City Hall last summer, said that Yoon “wasn’t really on the radar” at the time. “It’s a very gutsy move, since [Yoon] is young and a new council member,” she said. “Menino has really almost become an institution in Boston.”Yoon, who entered the Harvard Kennedy School after graduating from Princeton “wanting to change the world overnight,” finished his schooling in 1995 with what he called a “pretty cynical” attitude about government.“I thought that all real meaningful change happened at the grassroots level, not at a city level—but that’s really just half of the equation,” he said.  The former Pennsylvania resident got his first taste of Boston politics while working with the Asian Community Development Corporation (ACDC) in 2002, helping restore a parcel of land to Chinatown that had been claimed by the city and bulldozed 40 years earlier to pave a highway for the Big Dig. Yoon said that the scale of the campaign that ACDC mounted to reclaim the land led him to realize a fight for social change needed political backing in order to be truly efficacious.Boston’s Chinatown was founded in 1890, and it remains the only historically Asian neighborhood in New England.Despite a long-established presence in the city, Asian American representation in Boston politics has been nonexistent.Yao commented that if Yoon were to win, it would mean a lot symbolically for the Asian community in Boston. “Mayor Menino was the first Italian-American mayor, though Boston has a history of Irish mayors,” said Yao. “This would be a big deal. It would symbolize the new diversity in Boston, of the minority becoming majority.”—Staff writer Vidya B.

Engineering Professor Howard A. Stone is one of 65 newly-elected members of the National Academy of Engineering, according to a NAE statement released Friday. Stone was inducted for his research in viscous flow fluid dynamics, and joins 17 other Harvard professors who are currently members of the society.According to fellow NAE member and engineering professor John W. Hutchinson, Stone’s election reflects the quality of the Harvard engineering faculty, and in particular, the significance of his research.“His election is an honor especially for someone as young as him,” he said. Stone is 49.Stone will be departing to teach at Princeton—ranked number 12 among undergraduate engineering programs in 2008 by U.S. News and World Report—next semester, but his colleagues assert his election still holds significance for Harvard, ranked 33.Engineering professor James R. Rice said the honor “raises the visibility level” of the relatively young School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.Membership in the NAE is considered to be one of the highest awards for engineers, and the institution currently has 2,246 members in the U.S. Inductees are selected from all practices of engineering, including education, practice, and research. Stone said that he was honored and humbled to be elected, crediting his students and collaborators for their contributions to his success. For Stone, the election also had significance beyond the professional recognition—his father, Henry E. Stone was elected in 1981 and is currently an emeritus NAE member. Stone said that his election was a “pleasant surprise” for his father.“There is an extra special meaning for me,” Stone said, “to join my father as part of this great organization.”In addition to his research, Stone’s colleagues said that they admired his philanthropic spirit. According to Rice, a fellow NAE member, Stone “volunteers for everything he sees.”Hutchinson said that in additional to being a talented researcher, Stone is also a “marvelous” teacher to both the students at the School of Engineering and younger pupils. Stone was in Rhode Island teaching students about fluid mechanics the day he was elected to the NAE, according to Hutchinson.Stone received his undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from University of California-Davis, his Ph.D. from California Institute of Technology, and completed his Post Doctoral Work at Cambridge University. He joined the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1989.

While few Harvard professors will give their pupils below a C-, the National Council on Teacher Quality was not afraid to give Massachusetts a near-failing grade in its latest state survey on education policy. According to the report, Massachusetts received an overall grade of D, which was below the national average of D+. South Carolina received the highest overall score, with a B-. The council evaluated each state in terms of 15 goals, broken up into three sub-areas.Massachusetts state policy received a D- for identifying effective teachers, a D+ for retaining effective teachers, and a D+ for dismissing ineffective teachers. According to the report, Massachusetts “completely missed seven goals, met a small portion of four, partially met one, and nearly met one and fully met two.” One of the goals that Massachusetts met was establishing teacher induction programs in which new teachers are assigned a mentor. Massachusetts also fared well in increasing the salaries of teachers who teach in shortage subject areas or work at schools that are classified as “high needs.”  However, the report also notes that there are a number of areas in which Massachusetts can make significant improvements. These areas include making tenure decisions meaningful, setting clear penalties for teachers with unsatisfactory evaluations, and ensuring a fair pension system.Sandi Jacobs, vice president for policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality, said the study was conducted because state policy has a real impact on teacher quality and student achievement.“A lot of policies are more harmful to teacher quality than they are helpful,” she said.Jacobs said that although the poor results were not surprising to the Council, she is confident that if states institute the report’s regulatory recommendations, teacher quality and student performance can improve.“We’re pretty confident that we’re not proposing pie in the sky recommendations that cannot be implemented at the state level,” she said.Jonathan E. Palumbo, education press secretary of the Massachusetts Governor’s office, said that the administration is aware that the educational system has problems.“We recognize that we need to work harder, work stronger, and do a lot more to making the teaching profession more attractive in Massachusetts,” he said. —Staff writer Sofia E.

Adams House will bar non-residents from its dining hall Wednesday nights in an effort to reduce crowding and build community, the House announced last week.The Wednesday “community nights,” which begin today, come in response to dinner-time congestion that frequently plagues Adams. The dining hall—built to accommodate 220—consistently draws swarms of non-residents due to the House’s convenient location.“We’re in the eye of the storm,” said David A. Seley, the Adams dining hall manager.The move drew praise from Adams residents and criticism from regulars of the dining hall from other Houses.“Adams loves having guests from other houses,” said Adams tutor Matthew J. Corriel ’05, “but we long to get to know each other.”Lowell resident Alex L. Hugon ’11 lamented the switch, citing his own frequent use of the dining hall, saying he “always” eats there.But approval from Adams dwellers was not universal. Max A. Binder ’10 said the House Committee should have been less exclusive in restricting Wednesday diners.“I think everybody should be allowed to bring one guest to community night,” Binder said.Unfortunately for Binder, the Adams dining hall staff will enforce the inter-house restrictions strictly, according to Adams dining hall worker and card swiper Lucy F. Medeiros.“No inter-house, no guests. Just Adams House people,” she said.As part of the effort to foster a sense of community, the first Adams-only dinner tonight will include a reintroduction of the House tutors, Corriel said.The Adams community nights mimic similar restrictions in place at Quincy House, which has long held Quincy-only community nights every Thursday.The House chose Wednesday for the Adams-only dinners to coincide with weekly “Carvery Nights,” which feature a carving station in addition to normal HUDS offerings.The Wednesday restrictions come on top of long-standing limits on freshman diners in Adams, which draws many first-years because of its proximity to the Yard.Currently, Freshmen can only dine in Adams as guests of House residents.

Law School Dean Elena Kagan came one step closer to confirmation as the nation’s top representative to the Supreme Court yesterday, coasting through questions about her scant court experience and legal writings from senators who must approve her nomination.
Kagan elicited praise from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle, who touted her credentials as a constitutional scholar.
While she faced questions about her lack of experience before the Supreme Court, writings on separation of church and state, and opposition to a law requiring universities accepting public funds to allow military recruiters on campus, Kagan’s confirmation continued to appear likely.
She left the chamber feeling “very pleased,” according to Charles Fried, a former solicitor general and professor at the Law School, who attended the hearing.
The hearing had particular significance due to the recent revelation that 75 year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suffers from an often-fatal form of pancreatic cancer. Kagan has been widely mentioned as a possible replacement on the high court, and media reports have described the hearing as a dress rehearsal for a potential Supreme Court nomination.
Kagan did face questions from Republican senators, who echoed concerns raised among some conservatives in recent weeks about how strongly she would defend the government when she personally disagreed with its stance.
Arlen Specter, the ranking Republican on the committee, challenged Kagan over memos she had written while clerking for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall that asserted that religious organizations tend to promote their own beliefs via government-sponsored social programs.
Kagan batted aside the criticism by distancing herself from the remarks.
After reviewing the memos, Kagan dismissed her own work as “the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“I was a 27 year-old pipsqueak, and I was working for an 80 year-old giant in the law,” she said.
Kagan’s opposition to the Solomon amendment, a law that requires military recruiters access to universities that accept federal funds, also drew fire, but she again brushed off the criticism, saying she would set aside her own beliefs as solicitor general.
Senators Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, and Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona, contended that Kagan’s lack of Supreme Court experience might hurt her ability represent the government before the high court.
Saying that a “lifetime of learning and study of the law” is the central quality of a successful solicitor general, Kagan dismissed the criticism and pledged she would prove a quick study.
“I think that it’s just that these people have to have something to say,” Fried said, discounting criticism of Kagan’s lack of experience. “I don’t think it amounts to anything.”
No date has been set for a committee vote, and the committee record will remain open for a week, allowing nominees to submit written answers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At yesterday’s Faculty meeting, University President Drew G. Faust briefly stepped away from her role as chieftain of the University and assumed her role as historian.
Thursday, she said, is the 200th birthday of both Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin.
“Let us take from the inspiration of these two giants,” Faust said. “Let us try to deal with one another with a Lincolnian aspiration to the better angels of our nature and not the Darwinian spirit of...tooth and claw.”
Though the University may not face the perils of disease or warfare, wrangling with a fiscal crisis may pose comparable difficulties, said Faust, a specialist in the history of the antebellum South.
“I think of Harvard living through all kinds of crises, ranging from the Revolution to the Civil War to the small pox epidemics,” Faust mused. “I think this moment ranks up there in Harvard’s historical challenges.”
Though she empathized with departments that have had to slash budgets, Faust said such actions were worthwhile sacrifices to keep the institution afloat.
“We have been entrusted with a very precious resource,” Faust said. “It has preceded us, and it’s our obligation to shape how it’s going to outlive us.”
GEN ED, WHERE ART THOU?
As the Faculty grapples with the financial crisis, the imminent implementation of General Education may be the last thing on some professors’ minds. But Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds issued a plea for more professors to develop new Gen Ed courses—especially in the sciences and social sciences, where she said there are “very few courses: almost nothing.”
“Adding new courses to the curriculum should not be seen as committing ourselves to one more thing in our overscheduled and overburdened lives,” Hammonds said.
The Faculty also overwhelmingly approved a measure that would raise the minimum SAT II score for exemption from the foreign language requirement from 600 to 700 and would give students until junior year to complete the requirement.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis—one of Gen Ed’s most vocal critics—expressed his wariness of a normative curricular discussion. 
“Do we believe that students are spending their electives unwisely and we should have fewer of them? [Should we] impose our judgment about what is best for them?” Lewis said. “That’s not the way the review of Gen Ed started, but that is the way it has turned out.”
As a result of curricular changes that have yielded more possible requirements, students would end up taking fewer electives—“the unspoken category,” he said.
TIME TO RETIRE?
During the question-and-answer period of yesterday’s meeting, professor of Christian morals Peter J. Gomes approached the podium, righting himself against the wall as he stumbled a little.
He said he had heard that the University will offer a voluntary early retirement program for staff workers who are age 55 and over, and have 10 or more years of service.
“As I look around this room, there are a number of people 55 or older who served faithfully as faculty for at least a minimum of ten years,” Gomes said. “Are there any incentives for us to retire?”
After the Faculty broke into laughter, Faust confirmed that the University is considering such a plan. According to Faust, Judith D. Singer, the provost for faculty development and diversity, has been discussing the possibility of implementing a faculty retirement plan with the deans of Harvard’s schools.

The $838 billion economic stimulus package approved yesterday by the U.S. Senate includes $10 billion in funding for biomedical research—almost triple the amount allocated by the U.S. House of Representatives two weeks ago.The research grants, to be awarded by the National Institutes of Health, will  be welcomed by Harvard’s vast arrays of researchers and medical affiliates. For years, they have criticized the federal government for inadequately funding scientific research. According to Harvard statements on the issue, the NIH is currently able to fund less than two out of every ten grant applications, and thousands of approved projects lie dormant, awaiting funding. Harvard chief lobbyist Kevin Casey said both the Senate and the House had done “an exemplary job” of writing legislation that creates jobs and transforms the economy by emphasizing innovation and education. He noted that the NIH funding would provide short-term boosts to the economy since the stimulus is designed for a two-year period. “[There is] pent up scientific demand for increased funding, and there’s the capacity to deliver quickly on quality research,” Casey said, adding that the Human Genome Project had opened many avenues for scientific inquiry but lack of funding has subsequently stymied research efforts. “Since 2003, [NIH] funding has essentially been flat, so there are lots of great new ideas that have been awaiting funding.”In 2007, Harvard received nearly $1.4 billion in funding from the NIH, and over half of the University’s external research funding came from the NIH.The House of Representatives, which approved a similar stimulus bill two weeks ago but only allocated $3.5 billion for biomedical research, will now work with the Senate to forge a compromise bill for President Obama’s approval. The Senate bill was approved along party lines, with all 37 opposition votes coming from Republicans.  Economics and public policy professor Kenneth S. Rogoff said that compared to the trillions of dollars being spent on the overall economic stimulus—the Treasury also announced a new $2 trillion bank bailout yesterday—the funding for science was “small change.”But he added that he believes federal spending for science is invaluable and that biotech has been “one of our big engines of growth for the last 25 years.”“I don’t think the government is nearly over-supporting [science] at this point,” Rogoff said. “Science is one of [the nation’s] most competitive areas and certainly I’m in favor of increased funding.” While the Senate stimulus package included additional funding for the NIH, the bill includes far less for the physical sciences—the House’s stimulus package would provide the National Science Foundation with an additional $3 billion, and the Senate version allocates only $1.2 billion. —Staff Writer Peter F.

Harvard will soon offer early retirement packages to staff members in the University’s latest move to cut costs and push back the possibility of layoffs, top administrators said yesterday.
The plan—which covers staff over 55 who have worked at the University for over 10 years—will be implemented in two phases. The first is aimed at non-faculty employees at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical and Dental Schools, Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote in an e-mail to all staff yesterday. The second phase, coming in March, will consist of identical programs at the University’s other schools.
The announcement comes as the University struggles to right itself after the endowment plummeted 22 percent in a four-month period from its June 2008 value of $36.9 billion. Since then, University officials have projected a 30 percent decline in endowment value by the end of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009.
Discussions for offering a “generous” early retirement package had been underway since early December, when University President Drew G. Faust cautioned in a letter to the deans that Harvard would be taking a “hard look at hiring, staffing levels, and compensation.”
The University has taken a series of progressively stronger measures to reduce personnel costs—which make up 48 percent of the overall budget—starting with a hiring freeze on FAS staff announced in November, soon followed by a University-wide salary freeze for faculty and non-union staff in December.
Hausammann wrote that the program aims to “both offer generous incentives to qualifying employees who may wish to retire and help the University make progress in reducing overall compensation costs.”
At yesterday’s faculty meeting when the plan was presented, Faust emphasized that University officials must maintain a continued commitment to Harvard’s academic programs despite growing financial concerns.
“It is extremely important that when we make cuts, we do so with a large strategy in mind,” Faust said.
Similar retirement incentives for faculty are also under consideration, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said at the meeting.
Such early retirement plans would allow the University to control compensation costs and reduce the possibility of staff layoffs. 
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said workers nearing retirement would likely find the incentive package attractive.
But Jaeger acknowledged that employee retirement savings may have “taken a beating” in the last few months, meaning that those affected may feel the need to stay in the workforce for several years longer than planned.
Roughly 500 of the union’s members would satisfy the program’s age and term of employment criteria, Jaeger estimated.
It is unclear how soon University officials will be able to gauge staff response to the program, as federal anti-discrimination employment laws mandate that employees be given at least 45 days to consider such an offer.
The University’s most recent effort to contain costs harkens back to the 1991 economic recession, when Harvard created a similar early retirement program for all non-faculty employees.

Harvard slashed two-thirds of its holdings in publicly traded stocks during the three months ending Dec. 31, an indication that the University is reshuffling its portfolio following unprecedented losses in the ongoing financial crisis.
The overall value of Harvard’s publicly traded equities fell from $2.8 billion in September to only $571 million in January, according to a required quarterly disclosure report released Tuesday night by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
While the disclosed assets represent only a small fraction of the University’s total holdings, the shift hints at possible changes in the breakdown of the University’s investment portfolio, as Harvard’s money managers seek to navigate continuing market turmoil.
Harvard’s endowment—which is also invested in private equity, fixed-income bonds, and real assets not listed in the SEC 13F disclosure form—dropped at least 22 percent in the four months ending Oct. 31, Harvard officials announced in December.
According to University spokesman John D. Longbrake, 70 percent of the endowment is also currently managed by external investment firms. 
As of Sept. 30, Harvard had roughly $460 million, or 20 percent of its total 13F listed holdings, invested in emerging markets. But by Dec. 31, those assets—then only valued at $224 million—had come to represent nearly 40 percent of its total holdings, even though Harvard had sold one-third of its emerging market equity. 
Form 13F requires institutional investment managers to list all holdings in exchange-traded stocks and closed-end companies if they manage over $100 million in such assets. Whereas closed-end companies sell a fixed number of shares which are then traded on exchanges, open-end companies—such as mutual funds—pool publicly-raised money and invest the funds in stocks, bonds, and other securities. 
Emerging market equity represented 10 percent of Harvard’s total portfolio and returned 7.6 percent in the fiscal year ending last June 30, according to University reports. Fixed-income bonds represented 13 percent of the University’s holdings, while real assets—such as real estate and investments in timber and agricultural land—comprised 26 percent.
The equity shift follows reports last month of Harvard attempting to sell $1.5 billion of private equity, only to reject buyers’ offers as too low. The move would have marked one of the largest-ever sales of a private equity portfolio, according to the Wall Street Journal.

As part of University-wide budget cuts, the Harvard Divinity School has decided to temporarily suspend its Program in Religious Studies and Education (PRSE), according to program director Diane L. Moore. 
PRSE is a two-year program that allows students to simultaneously obtain a masters in religious studies and a middle or secondary school teaching license. 
Beginning in the 2009-10 academic year, no students will be admitted to the program for at least two years.
“Though disappointing, I believe the decision to put the Program in Religious Studies and Education on hold for two to three years is the right one in the face of the fiscal challenges facing the school,” said Moore in an e-mail statement. “I am hopeful that we will be able to secure outside funds to reinstate the program in a few years time. It is unique in the country and nearly 40 years old.”   
Recently, HDS announced that it would be cutting back its budget by 4 to 8 percent in the next fiscal year. HDS Dean William A. Graham announced that the school would reduce the number of adjunct and visiting positions offered the next year. According to Moore, this decision affected several core faculty in PRSE. 
This decision, however, should not affect the students currently enrolled in PRSE. The 16 students currently in the program will be able to finish their degree in a normal fashion, according to the PRSE Web site. 
“We are really making certain that our students who are in the program are certainly taken care of,” said PRSE Assistant Director Mary Frazier-Davis. 
According to Matthew A. Lewis, a first-year student at HDS, a number of first-year students expressed interest in transferring into the program before it was cut. “I’ve heard rave reviews about this program,” he said.
“It’s a transformative educational experience,” said Andrew Housiaux, a PRSE alumnus. “I think about education, the role of an educator, and the ability and capacity of students to learn in fundamentally different and more sophisticated ways because of it. It is disappointing that other students won’t have the chance.”
PRSE alumnus Jocelyn Beh agreed with Housiaux. 
“It’s a program that focuses on creating a space for adolescents to decide who they’re going to be—not just what kind of profession, but what kind of person they want to be,” she added.
Retired Lexington High School history teacher Jeff Glew, who has worked with many student teachers from PRSE, said that the religious training has brought a “unique twist” and “significant value” to their teaching.
“This will affect us enormously. The connection between Harvard and Lexington High School has been incredibly significant,” Glew said. “Having these younger, highly educated, sensitive people, trained through Harvard Divinity—the facilitation of learning was so significant. To see that go is a shame. It’s a loss to students.”

University officials advanced budget cutting measures at yesterday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, suggesting a likely slowdown in Allston construction and preparing to distribute long-awaited guidance for budget reductions to departments and centers later this month.
“Although it is clear that Allston is Harvard’s ultimate future, that future is going to be arriving a lot more slowly than we’d thought,” University President Drew G. Faust said.
Faust’s comment was the first public suggestion that construction in Allston will slow due to the financial crisis.
The Allston project has become a point of contention in recent months due to its hefty price tag and long-term nature, which some argue should make it subordinate to more immediate expenditures.
Faust said the administration hopes to make decisions “soon” regarding the specific timeline for Allston.
Cuts based on proposals submitted by departments and centers in January could make up approximately 77 percent of the $100 to $130 million shortfall in expenses for the next fiscal year, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said yesterday.
Smith said he will not publish specific department or center cuts to avoid any “premature or uninformed” announcement, but he reiterated his commitment to cut expenses by 15 percent across FAS over the next few years.
“I hope we can offer one another the benefit of the doubt and recognize that there will be more sacrifices,” said University President Drew G. Faust. “This institution and all it has represented for so very long is more than worthy of those sacrifices.”
Though the administration is projecting a higher spending level in the mid-six percent range—up from 4.6—for this year and next, according to Smith, even a far higher rate could mean flat or even reduced overall payouts from the endowment, depending on its value at the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
Harvard’s endowment has already dropped an estimated 22 percent from its June 30 value of $36.9 billion as of Oct. 31, and administrators have repeatedly said to plan for a 30 percent fall in value by the end of the fiscal year. 
The Faculty has yet to learn the exact payout rate for the fiscal year starting next July.
While Harvard waits for news of the endowment’s performance, the University must prepare various contingency plans to steel itself for an uncertain fiscal future, Faust said.
The Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences will reduce its number of accepted Ph.D. students by nine percent. Approximately 600 to 610 Ph.D. students—as opposed to the 660 accepted last fall—will be accepted for the next academic year, GSAS Dean Allan M. Brandt said.
Harvard’s move to reduce the number of graduate school fellowships mirrors similar measures taken by Northwestern and Stanford’s graduate schools to help alleviate the financial burden.

Nine genetic locations prone to mis-coding were found to be strongly associated with early heart attack patients in a study co-authored by two Harvard Medical School professors and others in a report published in Nature Genetics last Sunday. The identification of the locations may make it easier to diagnose patients at risk, and co-author David M. Altshuler, a professor of genetics and medicine at Harvard Medical School, said that the paper provides “new biological clues.”Co-author Christopher J. O’Donnell, an HMS associate clinical professor, began collecting genetic data 10 years ago. He said that he was “prompted by curiosity” about the specific causes of heart attacks, adding that when he began there was no strong evidence for any specific gene association with heart attacks. The information from  O’Donnell’s previous research, as well as data from six other labs, was compiled into a set of 3,000 heart attack patients and 3,000 controls. Researchers performed a million tests on each patient’s DNA for a total of 6 billion tests, said O’Donnell. The study used a gene chip developed by Altshuler’s team that can screen simultaneously for single problematic genetic locations and deletions of large chunks of DNA. When the data was processed through the chip, researches found nine single genetic locations, but no large deletions, to be associated with increased risk for early heart attacks. This was the first time the gene chip was used to look at heart attacks, according to Altshuler. Genetics are already considered an important casual factor in early heart attacks. The predictive power of genetics may someday become greater than that of cholesterol measurement, Altshuler said.In a world where pharmaceutical companies are trying to market genetic tests to diagnose disease, the study may provide information for potential drug therapies. However, according to O’Donnell, “more evidence” is still necessary.

BOSTON—A lot has changed since Harvard and Boston College last met in the Beanpot two years ago.
Last night, junior and former Eagle Anna McDonald was wearing crimson, rather than scoring the game-winner for the other team. This time around, it was BC that held the upper hand in the national polls.
But one thing remains the same. At the end of the night, the Eagles came out on top, and they have their goaltender to thank.
“Molly Schaus,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “They had Molly Schaus. It’s that simple. She’s the difference-maker for them. We had lots of good looks at the net, and she came up very big.”
Schaus kept the Crimson guessing all night, smothering every one of the 40 shots the typically potent Harvard offense launched at her.
1-on-1 breakaways? Five penalty kills? Facing reigning Patty Kazmaier winner Sarah Vaillancourt when she’s coming off a 13-point week? 
No problem. Schaus was there when her team needed her. 
And without the outstanding play of their junior netminder, the Eagles wouldn’t have been in a position to win the game.
The Crimson controlled much of the offensive play, outshooting BC, 19-6, in the first period and by a 12-3 margin in the third. For the game, Harvard held a 40-23 shot advantage. 
“Molly Schaus played a great game for them,” said Schaus’ Crimson counterpart, junior goalie Christina Kessler.
Schaus seemed to be everywhere. Some of her best play came in the second—the only period in which her Eagles outshot Harvard. She nabbed sophomore Liza Ryabkina’s long slapshot on a power play with a beauty of a glove save, and a few minutes later, she stymied senior Sarah Wilson on a breakaway chance. 
“I can’t say enough about Molly,” BC coach Katie King said. “She’s great. She really stepped up tonight, and she knew she was going to face some shots…She’s an extremely hard worker and just tries to do whatever she can to make the save, and she did that tonight.”
Luckily for the Crimson, Kessler was on her game as well. For nearly 50 minutes of play, the netminders traded impressive saves as both offenses grew frustrated with their inability to put the puck in the net. 
“Kess played great tonight,” Stone said. “Second period, she kept us in it. She was getting mauled in [front of the net], and she did a great job.”
In that second frame, Kessler and her defense faced a tough two minutes of penalty kill after junior Kathryn Farni was whistled for checking.
Two scrums in front of the net led to two near-goals for the Eagles, but Kessler kept her head up even when the puck was ricocheting off skates all over the crease.
As the third period wore on, thoughts of the teams’ last meeting—a 4-3 triple-overtime win for BC in the 2007 Beanpot opener—began to resurface. With both goaltenders playing lights-out, triple overtime suddenly started to seem possible.
“I was reminiscing about the game when we went to three overtimes with them, so I was hoping it wasn’t going to go that long,” King said. “Both goaltenders were playing well, and not for a lack of opportunities either. It was definitely nerve-wracking.”
Schaus shined in BC’s 2007 marathon win, making an NCAA-record 73 saves. 
“I think it’s more of the Beanpot, it’s just so exciting,” she said. “You watch it growing up and you hear about it all year. This is what you play for.”
But this year, the Eagles didn’t need extra time to win it. 
For all of Kessler’s outstanding play, it’s the one save she couldn’t make that will be remembered. 
BC junior Kelli Stack’s shorthanded tally may not have been a sudden-death stunner, but it left Harvard heartbroken all the same.
“That’s a no-winner,” Stone said. “[Kessler] couldn’t do anything about that puck.”
With Schaus in the net, that one goal was all the Eagles would need. 
The Crimson was once again sent home wondering how to solve BC’s star goaltender.
“I knew with Molly in the net, all we needed was one goal to win,” Stack said. “I kind of figured that it was going to be a 1-0 game. It was awesome.”

After battling a long illness, former Harvard wrestling coach and two-time Crimson All-American John H. Lee Jr. ’53 passed away yesterday.Lee demonstrated lifelong commitment to Harvard wrestling, devoting 35 years to the program as a student-athlete and coach. One of only seven grapplers to be elected to the Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame, Lee enjoyed a stellar career in the Crimson singlet. As a junior and senior, the four-year standout capped his two All-American seasons by finishing fourth in the NCAA championships at 123 lbs. Since that time, only three other Harvard wrestlers have equaled or surpassed this feat, the last of which was Jesse Jantzen ’04, a three-time place winner.Lee also punctuated his career with a 1951 AAU National Championship at 125 lbs.The two-time Crimson captain returned to his alma mater in 1956 to continue his leadership efforts as a coach. After leaving his mark on all levels of the program as freshman team head coach and assistant varsity coach, Lee took full control of the varsity squad from his coach and mentor, Bob Pickett, in 1968.Lee enjoyed an 18-year tenure as the face of Harvard wrestling, compiling a 165-121-5 record, including the standing record for wins in a season with 17 in 1981. The coach also guided 27 EIWA place winners and 14 NCAA qualifiers, as well a remarkable team effort, placing 19th at the 1983 NCAA championships. This campaign marked the third-best finish ever for a Crimson squad.Lee not only orchestrated stellar seasons, but also demonstrated sustained brilliance, leading Harvard to ten winning seasons and four second place finishes in the Ivy League.The long-time Crimson coach also continued the precedent for stability within Harvard wrestling. Following Pickett’s example, Lee yielded the team seamlessly to his successor Jim Peckham, and the Crimson has had only one other coach since. Current head coach Jay Weiss marks his 16th season with Harvard this spring.Lee’s nearly two decades at the helm of Crimson wrestling represent the second-longest tenure for a Harvard grapplers’ head coach, but his contribution to the sport extended well beyond Cambridge. Lee served as a member of the United States Olympic Committee from 1968-1976 and as a member of the NCAA Wrestling Coaches Association from 1978-1982.

BOSTON—All good things must come to an end, and so too did the Harvard women’s hockey team’s seven-game winning streak. At the hands of No. 7 Boston College, Harvard lost its Beanpot championship title in a fiercely fought 1-0 match last night at Northeastern’s Matthews Arena.Despite a scoreless first two periods, the Eagles (20-7-3, 12-5-1 Hockey East) managed their close win thanks to a shorthanded shot from junior Kelli Stack midway through the third period. The Crimson (13-8-3, 12-4-2 ECAC) struggled to net the equalizer while the last seconds on the clock ticked away.In the defining moment of the game, BC’s Allie Thunstrom broke away from the Eagles’ goal into Crimson territory. Chased by Harvard’s tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, Thunstrom slipped a pass to Stack, who sent it to the right of Harvard goalie Christina Kessler into the back of the net.“I took that extra step out to cut down that angle on [Thunstrom], and unfortunately she was able to squeeze a pass across to Stack, and Stack put it in,” Kessler said.Despite reclaiming the prestigious Beanpot title they won in 2007, the Eagles had a tough time breaking away from Harvard in the first periods. Prior to the last 20 minutes, the Crimson showed force on the offensive end. Aggressive right from the start, Harvard took its first shot on Schaus in the opening minute, following that up with 18 more shots in the frame.In the second period, the Crimson picked up the tempo as both teams’ frustration with the score began to show. But as the pace increased, so too did the amount of penalties against Harvard. With only nine shots on goal, Harvard saw five of its players hit the penalty box as the Eagles took 14 shots against Kessler, the most of any period for Boston College.“We put the ball back in BC’s court for a while in the second period, and we staved off a ton of pressure, killed off a 5-on-3 and so we felt good about that,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Tough luck is what happened, and they capitalized on our mistakes. That’s what they do well.”But despite controlling the puck for the majority of the first two periods, Harvard could not get past Boston College’s main force: junior goalie Molly Schaus. Schaus again performed at her best during the Beanpot, notching 40 saves against the Crimson and unanimously winning the Bertagna Award for best goaltender.“They’re a great team and to their credit they fought all the way through,” Kessler said. “I think we came out flying in the first period, and we tried all we could, but Molly Schaus played a great game for them.”It was Stack, however, who put the Eagles on the scoreboard, receiving the tournament’s MVP award for her success.“Stack and Allie are dangerous on a penalty kill and you know, if it wasn’t Stack, it was probably going to be Allie who put it in,” said Boston College coach Katie King. “They really find a way to block shots and get opportunities.”Additionally, the Eagles made sure to put the pressure on Vaillancourt, who has defined the Crimson’s offense, scoring 16 goals this season and attempting three shots last night. Vaillancourt has been on a tear of late, with a hand in 13 of Harvard’s 14 goals last week.“We saw what she did last week against BU, and we knew we couldn’t give her too much room,” Schaus said.Not to be deterred, Kessler and the rest of the Crimson showed their own moments of brilliance as well. At the end of the night, Kessler managed 22 saves against the Eagles as her defense posted seven blocks of their own.But it was not enough.“There’s nothing a coach can say in a one-goal game when you lose the Beanpot championship, one you have tremendous pride in winning,” Stone said.In preparation for Harvard’s upcoming games against ECAC rivals Cornell and Colgate this weekend, Stone suggested the best thing for her team is rest. “The key is, we’re playing great hockey right now,” she said. “We’re in a very different place than we were before Christmas...We might not have come up on the high side of tonight’s win, but we played very well and we want to continue to play well.”
