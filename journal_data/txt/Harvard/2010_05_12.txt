After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Postal Service recently announced its plan to cut Saturday mail delivery in the face of growing deficits and decreasing mail volume. The cuts have widespread public support from 71 percent of Americans, including majorities of both political parties, even though the projected job losses are undesirable for a country just exiting a major recession. Simultaneously, the reiteration of the USPS’s financial woes has prompted some calls for the agency to fully privatize. We support the Saturday service cuts as an unpleasant but necessary money-saving measure; however, we reject any calls for the Postal Service to privatize, either now or in the future.
It is true that the USPS right now spends more money than it earns. It predicts an operating loss between six and 12 billion dollars this year. But to presume that our nation’s postal service must take in more money than it spends is to treat it like a privately owned delivery company when, in reality, the USPS is a social service. Indeed, postal service is one of the fundamental functions of our government. The Constitution specifically grants Congress the power to “establish Post Offices and Post Roads” in between the powers to coin money and establish federal courts—all key components of our national unity. We are proud to have a government and a Constitution that take on this responsibility rather than leave communication throughout our nation up to a private entity.
Furthermore, the USPS has offices in small towns throughout the country, which serve as entrances of disparate government services into more isolated regions. It is impractical to assume that private delivery services such as FedEx and UPS would establish offices everywhere that the USPS currently serves. Even if they did, such offices would be mere retail outlets; they would not contribute to national unity the way USPS offices currently do. Finally, privatization and the likely concomitant rise in prices and fall in locations would hurt those who are already disadvantaged the most, such as people without phone or Internet services, or those who are unable to use such technologies.
However, mail volume is decreasing and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Although privatization is not the remedy to this problem, it is appropriate for the USPS to scale back rather than to build up debt with unnecessary services and then to need to make massive cuts in the future. Furthermore, because the job losses due to cutting service on Saturdays will occur primarily through attrition via retirement and early retirement packages, they will not do the economy too great a disservice. Thus, the Postal Service should continue ahead with its well-researched plan to cut costs but should retain its privileged public position in the years to come.

When the online self-described “legal tabloid” Above the Law reported on Stephanie Grace’s now infamous e-mail—which suggested that African-Americans are predisposed to be less intelligent—two weeks ago, they should have been able to predict the blogosphere storm that would ensue. Shortly after Above the Law’s post, which attempted to keep the author of the e-mail and the individual who forwarded it anonymous, Gawker released their names and pictures to the public. Public Internet sentiment comes out strongly against Grace, a third-year Harvard Law School student, and calls are even being made for her federal clerkship to be revoked. We find these attacks on Stephanie Grace, based on a leaked private e-mail, to be distressing and alarming. It is inappropriate that her identity and future have now been made topics of very active and very public debate.
Although we strongly disagree with the content of Grace’s email, we do not think that her clerkship should be revoked. Although Grace’s actions do demonstrate a lack of judgment, the e-mail’s release was beyond her control. Gawker and other sites are now reporting that the message was actually forwarded a while after it was initially sent. With this in mind, the public shaming of Grace may not have been motivated by wholly pure intentions. Thus, we find it entirely illegitimate for students at HLS to target Grace alone. Surely the individuals who leaked her private e-mail to the campus and to the press deserve significant condemnation. We are dismayed that her private e-mail was exposed in such a manner and hope that people are able to continue to express non-politically correct views (that do not constitute hate speech or pose a clear and present danger) in order to provoke discussion and awareness.
By no means are we attempting to trivialize the content of Grace’s e-mail. The assumptions contained within it are offensive, misguided, and fundamentally false. However, Grace’s e-mail should have been handled very differently. Numerous articles argue that race is largely a social construct, and that intelligence does not appear to be influenced by racial genetic differences.
Leaking the private, albeit imprudent, e-mail to the public has invited a barrage of undeserved, venomous criticism against both Grace and the University itself. Bloggers and commentators have made unfair and inaccurate mischaracterizations of the Harvard community based upon the statements of a single student. Harvard University is committed to racial, cultural, and socioeconomic diversity and acceptance; the actions of Stephanie Grace are not emblematic of the institution as a whole. It is worth noting that this e-mail garnered so much attention, especially from the press, because it was written at Harvard. Had such a message been forwarded at other institutions, it is questionable whether it would have generated the same reaction. It is frightening that, as Harvard students, our private e-mails and thoughts are available for public and potentially venomous scrutiny. Further, the power that blogs such as Gawker and Above the Law have to publicly tarnish reputations is disconcerting. Despite their existence in a journalistic grey area, bloggers should be held more accountable for the power that they wield and, as such, must act responsibly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 21st century college campus is probably the least-hospitable environment for antiquated shows of social inequality. Be it the youthful spirit of progressivism, the rebellious disposition of young adults, or simply an ignorance of the realist demands of life not-yet-faced, college students do not have a reputation for sitting still amidst social injustice. The “Z-list” is one example of an institutional structure designed with little concern for socially equitable outcomes that has met with considerable animosity in recent months.
Admissions officers use the Z-list to annually admit thirty to fifty students more than the Harvard class size can fit; the officers extend admission on the mutual understanding that the students will take a gap year and join the subsequent class. What makes these students substantively different from their peers who are accepted through the regular process is largely unclear; indeed, many do become well-known, and essential members of the Harvard community. However, there are apparent disparities between the demographics of Z-listers and Harvard as a whole. In an article published by The Crimson in the summer of 2002, 76 percent of a sample of the incoming Z-list class had parents who attended Harvard. Although most students chide the College for allowing a practice that seems to unfairly favor those of more privileged backgrounds, I am unperturbed. The Z-list is necessary as an institutional fixture that facilitates progressivism at Harvard.
As a college student, I understand the impulse to rebuke injustice, but I also understand that Harvard is both a school and an independent corporation. Therefore, Harvard must navigate its way through the myriad financial difficulties that face any multi-billion dollar organization while acting in a responsible manner that befits its end goal of undoing social disparity and serving society.
In this context, Harvard must not merely pay maintenance staff enough so that they clean the school’s manifold facilities adequately; the College must pay employees wages that allow them a decent standard of life. They are obligated to accommodate students’ desires for stronger support of club sports, Yardfest, and other community-building endeavors around campus. Additionally, there are a multitude of socially beneficial initiatives that the University as a whole is undertaking at great difficulty; among these are the new science complex under construction in Allston, the new Engineering School, renovations to the University’s museum collections, and the “Green is the new Crimson” campaign.
Most importantly, the College must support one of the strongest financial aid programs in the country. Compared to the 70 percent that receive financial aid in a full class at Harvard, the Z-list has little more than 14 percent of its members on aid of any kind. Although Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 denies economic motivation behind Z-list decisions, the financial security of those on the list suggests otherwise. But if it is the case that these students are a financial asset to the College, than they are as equally qualified as athletes, actors, and the myriad other students with talents who are recruited to make Harvard a better place. Indeed, the student Z-listed to please a long line of donors and College supporters may be responsible for the financial aid that allows 70 percent of his or her classmates to attend.
Although Harvard is an astonishing place on multiple levels, the College cannot be asked to perform economic miracles. The substantial money Harvard spends on progressive initiatives has to originate somewhere. Harvard thrives financially because it has a wealthy network of benefactors and supporters who believe in its cause. Those who donate generously to this mission are friends of the institution and must be treated as such if we expect to continue leading the academic world. Sometimes this source of funding does not appear as noble or progressive to us as the places where the funds ultimately end. But we must keep things in perspective; students must stop speaking out against programs such as the relatively innocuous Z-list or face the reality of losing the expensive humanitarian lifestyle they simultaneously advocate for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the night before exams, and you have failed to study. In some cultures, this shameful act and its implications for your family would lead you to move to Sweden tomorrow to pursue an acting career. But I am here to reassure you and give you courage to carry you forward.
Every year, The Crimson dutifully re-runs columns by supposed graders and supposed exam-takers, offering ways to “beat the system” or “work, successfully, within the constraints of the system.” But as someone who has never graded an exam in my life, except once when my aunt, who is an eighth-grade history teacher, allowed me to read some raps her students had written that were inspired by Benjamin Franklin, I can tell you that what they have to say is ridiculous. I’ve taken lots of exams, and I know how this works.
My father, who has also taken exams—including colonoscopies, apparently more pleasant than the Ec 10 final—once shared with me some advice he had received about exams. “Don’t read the material,” he said. “You don’t have time. Just make flashcards of the thinkers. Say that the ones who came before influenced the ones who came after, and that the ones who came after were influenced by the ones who came before.”
This always made sense to me.
But if that seems like too much effort, fear not. In history, there are a lot of precedents for people who did poorly on their exams.
If, for instance, you have had the dubious fortune of wandering through Harvard Yard at the same time as a tour led by Crimson Key, you will probably be familiar with the story of Gertrude Stein and William James and the final exam. Gertrude Stein received the final exam book and wrote: “I am sorry but really I do not feel a bit like an examination paper in philosophy today.” To this, William James responded, “I know exactly how you feel. A.” I once tried this, and the grader wrote back, “Neither do I, but unfortunately, this was the Math 23 exam. F.” If this has not been exactly encouraging, I have a wide array of alternative suggestions.
On math exams, it is wise to include plaintive stick figures along with your proofs and diagrams. If they fail to enhance your answers, they at least inspire pity in your grader. If your course involves any form of geometry, give your shapes personality. Who can fail someone whose geometric forms have big, sad eyes, especially if they are labeled things like “Mr. Triangle” and “Uncle Rhombus”? If nothing else, their dispute with Doctor Integral will keep him turning those pages!
In literature courses, try writing poetry on the backs of your pages that implies that your family life has taken a turn for the worse. Especially try haiku. “If it weren’t for my/Sister’s prescription abuse/ I would do better.” I have no advice for science cores, because I firmly believe that if you just draw a diagram of literally anything, with cross-hatching, labeling parts of it “A,” “C,” and “F,” and write the words “friction” and “valence electrons” somewhere around it, you cannot fail. Also, if you want to review by watching movies, keep in mind that the plot of “Hamlet” is fundamentally the same as “The Lion King.”
When it comes to history, think about the big picture. If someone wrote all his answers to your exam in Cuneiform, would you fail him? If possible, describe World War I as “the slimmer, more homoerotic World War II.” This also works for most WGS courses.
When it comes to art history, incorporate vague, baffling allusions to the artist’s life. “You can just feel how many ears Van Gogh has here in Arles,” you can observe. “But Gauguin! Ah, lurking, contumelious Gauguin!”
If you are unsure of what you are saying, use a lot of exclamation points! But not more than one per sentence! This conveys enthusiasm, something instructors like to reward.
If you are taking an economics exam, cross out the assumptions in all the questions and write things like, “In the light of Goldman, this feels like barking up the wrong tree.”
If it’s a computer science final, try using lots of ones and zeroes. But maybe just slightly more ones.
If you are taking a class on moral reasoning or religion, try to incorporate the phrase “What would Jesus do?” up to eight times, just to make it clear you weren’t joking around the first time or two. If you sense that it isn’t working, smudge your page mysteriously, raise your hand, and tell the beleaguered Cambridge resident administering your test that “a miracle has occurred, and He is Here.” Explain that you can’t turn the exam in “for religious reasons,” and rush out of the exam room, chanting in tongues.
All in all, the only thing I would advise against is cheating. Usually the people on either side of you have even less of an idea of what they are doing than you do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, I laid out an outline for sensible financial-reform legislation. Many of the principles of this framework look as though they will be kept in the Congress’s final bill, including a stronger consumer-protection agency and an over-the-counter exchange for derivatives. Yet as the legislation has gained steam and popularity over the last few weeks, politicians are predictably spewing populist demagoguery and wasting an opportunity to implement intelligent regulations. Congress must keep the unintended effects of their measures in mind as they finalize the legislative details on trading derivatives and supervising the Federal Reserve System.
One of the perhaps most important sections of this legislation will focus on derivatives trading. Derivatives, financial instruments that are used to bet on movements of assets and thus serve as protections against risk, are often necessary for many different kinds of businesses, ranging from farms to airlines to banks. Yet during the crisis, banks took enormous risks with derivatives, and these risks were neither monitored nor regulated by the government as most of the derivatives were traded in over-the-counter transactions, private trades between two parties.
It is imperative that derivatives trading be shifted to exchanges where such trades can be monitored and regulated, and the legislation had been moving in this direction. However, Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln has now introduced an amendment to the legislation that will cause banks to spin off their derivatives trading businesses entirely. Although this measure seems like it will decrease risk in the financial system, in reality, it will only transfer the risk to murkier and less-visible facets of the financial world.
Under Lincoln’s proposal, hundreds of billions of dollars in existing derivatives trading would be spun off to entities such as hedge funds and foreign banks, which are beyond the scope of regulators, or associated bank entities that are not technically part of the bank, in both cases increasing risk and causing difficulties for regulators. It is smarter to keep derivatives trading within the major banks and impose tougher oversight and regulation on these institutions than to spin off the derivatives trading to where we can neither regulate nor examine the market.
Another provision in the legislation that has become popular in recent days is a measure to “audit” the Federal Reserve and open information about its operations to the general reserve. The measure, passed yesterday by the Senate, and proposed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders would require the Federal Reserve to disclose the recipients of its lending during the financial crisis and to open up to an examination of its programs that have “injected liquidity into the money markets” and will examine “whether the credit facility inappropriately favors one or more specific participants over other institutions eligible to utilize the facility.” By examining who has received credit from the Federal Reserve during the crisis, this amendment sets a political precedent that could result in a constrained central banking authority during future crises.
Though the amendment has been narrowed in order to ensure that it will not aim to politically influence the creation and setting of monetary policy, it still interferes with the necessity of an independent Federal Reserve with the power to act in times of crisis. In the financial system, a bank does not need actually to be running out of money for a bank run to occur; there only needs to be the impression that the bank might be running out of money. This is why all of the major banks only received Troubled Asset Relief Program funds in concert, even though some of them needed the funding more than others. This is also why the Federal Reserve must have the power to support the financial system without strict disclosure requirements. The mere appearance of needing help during a time of crisis could bring a bank down.
On an even greater scale, this amendment violates one of the basic foundational principles of our central banking system: Our economy hinges on the trust that we place in the Federal Reserve to look out for the best interests of the economy at large, independent of any political influence whatsoever.  Through administrations that might be victim to political pressures of all types, the Federal Reserve does what is right for the stability of our economy, be it the case of former Chairman Paul Volcker’s raising of interest rates to historically high levels in order to cut inflation in the early 1980s, or Chairman Ben Bernanke ’75’s opening up of lending windows to major investment banks during the financial crisis, despite the deep political unpopularity of such measures. By opening up the Federal Reserve’s operations to naked populist critiques, the Sanders amendment begins to violate this trust in an independent and apolitical central banking authority.
As the debate continues, many Democrats and Republicans are trying to outdo each other to see who can seem “toughest” on reform, but in the process, they are failing to understand which regulations really need to be in place for the economy to function well. Derivatives trading will occur throughout the future, whether in a bank or a distant unregulated entity, and it is best if it occurs in major banks under the watchful eyes of regulators. There will be future crises with politically unpopular but necessary monetary solutions, and an independent Federal Reserve will need to be there to solve them. Legislators are smart enough to realize these truths; the question is, are they brave enough to make legislation that is meant to serve the future good?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the road toward recovery, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has pared down its once-looming deficit to about $50 million, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said yesterday.
Setting a positive tone at the last Faculty meeting of the year, Smith announced that the budget deficit now stands between $50 to $55 million—a roughly $30 million reduction in the deficit since February.
Smith said that he expects to further trim the deficit down to $35 million before June 30, when next year’s budgets must be finalized across FAS. He added that he hopes to present this anticipated figure to the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—by July 1.
In an interview with The Crimson after the meeting, Smith said that FAS achieved its recent reduction of about $30 million with the help of restricted funds.
The University has been able to delve into underwater funds—accounts with spending restrictions that have fallen below their original amounts—through a recent lift on a Mass. policy that prohibits institutions from dipping into such funds.
In accordance with the dean’s “first-dollar principle,” the school has redoubled its efforts to spend these restricted funds on core expenditures, before spending money that can be allocated more freely.
Smith told the Faculty that he hopes to balance FAS’ budget by the fiscal year that ends in 2012. Further cuts and the FAS reserves will cover the gap in the meantime, he added.
The optimistic depiction of FAS’ current budgetary status at yesterday’s meeting comes after nearly $160 million in reductions to the deficit, which had stood at an imposing $220 million in the fall of 2008.
“So it has been 18 months since I stood in front of you and talked about the global ramifications of the global crisis” on FAS, Smith said. “It is hard for me to express how proud I am of our entire community to push us forward in this difficult time.”
But Smith said that the school faces financial hurdles ahead, in the form of a greater demand on its financial aid program, a slightly larger incoming class at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and building plans that have been put on hold in light of the bleak fiscal climate.
“We must continue these smart sustainable changes that have brought us this far,” he said.
THE FUTURE OF EXAMS
At yesterday’s meeting, the Faculty passed the proposal to make three-hour examinations at the end of the semester opt-in rather than opt-out for course leaders. Currently, the Office of the Registrar’s default assumption is that all professors will give exams at the close of a course, unless a professor specifically petitions the Registrar to do otherwise, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who spearheaded the proposal.
But in the past academic year, only a quarter of all courses offered by the College gave full-length exams, reflecting a recent trend away from that style of examination.
Harris said that the new policy, which will no longer make exams the default form of final assessment in courses, is not an endorsement of the recent move away from offering three-hour exams. Rather, the changes are motivated by the desire to streamline the process of devising the exam schedule, he said.
To further simplify the scheduling process, Harris said that the Registrar intends to publish each semester’s exam schedule earlier than usual.
But some professors expressed concern at yesterday’s meeting that the trend toward fewer exams on campus may lead to alternate forms of assessment that are less effective at differentiating academic performance among students.
“I’m going to vote for it because it seems reasonable and saves a lot of bureaucracy,” English Department Chair James T. Engell ’73 said. “But I want my fellow colleagues...to realize what the historical trend in the college is—it is to examine less and less and less and less.”

A Sociology course about modern-day slavery designed by undergraduates will be taught next spring by Sociology Professor Orlando Patterson.
The course, which is the culmination of months of research by members of Harvard College for Free the Slaves (HCFTS) and fellows at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, is tentatively titled “Slavery and Trafficking in the Modern World.” It is currently under consideration for inclusion in the General Education curriculum.
Though Patterson presented the course to the Gen Ed committee this spring, he said that committee members expressed concerns that it may not have a long enough shelf life and that it would be too centered on activism.
“There’s no danger of that with me,” said Patterson, who will present the course to the Gen Ed committee again in the fall. “The beginning of activism is understanding and knowledge, so we’re going to let the facts speak for themselves.”
The curriculum analyzes slavery through five lenses: health, law, history, economics, and social movements.
“A lot of times modern slavery gets tagged as a human rights issue, but we’re trying to show that a lot of other disciplines contribute to an understanding of it as well,” said HCFTS President Kelli K. Okuji ’10.
The six student researchers spent months reading the literature of their field, reviewing curricula at other colleges, and interviewing professors and modern abolitionists.
“I love teaching in general, so it was fun thinking, ‘If I were a teacher, how would I express this new subject?’” Catherine D. Cook ’12 said. “But we also had a lot of responsibility to be very serious and truthful about the matter.”
The students’ work was revised by a team of fellows and professors, including History and Literature Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93. But designing the syllabus and creating assignments were only the first steps, according to Amanda N. Nguyen ’13.
“We had to go and make appointments and present the course to professor after professor, and we petitioned to show that the community supported this issue,” Nguyen said. “It was important that we had certain people on board.”
The students had to “plow on” in the face of the course’s uncertain approval, according to research adviser Eric Goodwin, a master’s student at the Extension School. The course was approved by the Sociology department last month.
“When we met with her, President Faust said in her time here, there have been no student-led initiatives like this where students have approached the university with course in hand, demanding that it be taught,” Okuji said of her meeting with Faust at office hours in February.
Goodwin said the course reveals ways that humans contribute to structures that facilitate different kinds of trafficking, from debt bondage to sex slavery.
“This is the great human rights challenge of our generation, and in order for us to face that challenge and actually finally eradicate slavery—which I think is something we can do in a generation—it takes leaders,” said E. Benjamin Skinner, a Carr Center fellow and another research adviser. “And what better place to train leaders than Harvard University?”

Administrators and scientists hailed the unveiling of a facility yesterday that will boast 12 state-of-the-art microscopes shared by researchers across the University.
University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of Science Jeremy Bloxham cut the ribbon on the Center for Biological Imaging, a facility that, in partnership with optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, will offer leased imaging equipment updated every three years.
“Not only does the Center for Biological Imaging have state-of-the-art Zeiss imaging equipment, it will continue to have that equipment under the very special agreement that Zeiss and MCB have agreed upon,” Faust said.
The regular replacement of the microscopes in the Center—a dark, L-shaped room on the second floor of the Biological Laboratories with equipment lining its perimeter—led Faust, Molecular and Cellular Biology Chair Catherine Dulac, and Carl Zeiss MicroImaging President James A. Sharp to characterize it as an “evergreen” facility.
Additionally, a Zeiss employee will be on site starting in June to help researchers use the machinery, according to Sharp.
To use the Center, graduate students, research fellows, and faculty members will have to pay roughly $2000 per year in a plan that MCB Professor Jeff W. Lichtman likened to a gym membership.
Undergraduates affiliated with a Harvard lab will be able to use the facility at no cost.
Lichtman, who was involved in constructing the plan, said the arrangement will allow for a financially sustainable replacement of microscopes, which are quickly rendered out-of-date by technological innovation.
In addition to cycling new microscopes in for old ones, Zeiss may use the Center to pilot new equipment, Sharp said.
“We will be able to simulate, when we come up with something new, whether it will have value,” Sharp said.
Deborah McEwan, a graduate student in the MCB department who is about to receive her degree, said that bringing the microscopes together in one room will allow all researchers to be aware of the resources available to them.
Katherine W. Rogers, another MCB graduate student, said that the open-air nature of a room with 12 microscopes as opposed to the usual one or two will promote collaboration.
“It is a really great resource for everyone,” Rogers said. “The fact that there are no walls is great because if there’s someone over here and I have a question, I can just wander over and talk to them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Northwest Science Building came to life with curious crowds on April 30.
“Play it. Light it. Dance it,” was the theme of the night at this unconventional lab, where a silent rave had students breaking barriers in science. It was The Laboratory’s latest event, which brought iPods and LEDs together to explore the intersections between science, music, and the visual arts.
Such interdisciplinary endeavors are typical of The Lab’s events and exhibitions. The Lab is a platform for experimentation—a place to share and develop ideas, it encourages creativity among students and the community at large, holding interdisciplinary exploration and collaboration at the heart of its philosophies, says W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, a fellow at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and The Lab.
In collaboration with the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.), The Lab hopes to bring together art and science—two often-contentious disciplines—in a synergistic way.
A dance is just the beginning. The Lab organizers say they hope that this three-year pilot that arose in November out of the syllabus of an engineering class will expand to bridge the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences with the Graduate School of Design.
“It’s all about crossing the boundaries,” says Jessica S. Lin ’09, a fellow at The Lab and a former Crimson associate photo editor.
DANCE IT
The lower level of the Northwest Science Building was as quiet as any library reading room.
The silent ravers, with LEDs attached to the different parts of the body, moved about in their own dance styles while listening to their individual tracks.
Slow shutter speed cameras recorded the movement of the LEDs, projecting these images across the room to convert dance into light.
The objective of it all? To visualize music through light photography.
Making use of conventional artistic disciplines such as dance, music, and photography, The Lab looked to map out commonalities in the way in which people dance to certain genres of music, says Allegra E. Libonati, artistic fellow at the A.R.T. who worked with The Lab to develop and organize the experiment.
Though the event’s turnout fell short of expectations, Van Vuuren deemed the rave a success.
“Clearly Harvard has too many events and House formals in the late Spring period for us to have pulled thousands of people, but we were very happy with the untraditional nature of the event and the media that was created,” Van Vuuren says.
In order to take part in this unique experiment, The Lab asked the participants—both graduates and undergraduates—to follow a three-step instructional guide in preparation: pre-download the four playlists off The Lab’s website, bring an MP3 player, and show up to make art.
AN EVOLVING IDENTITY
Conceived by Harvard Biomedical Engineering Professor David A. Edwards, The Laboratory at Harvard opened last November alongside a series of successful initiatives.
The global company Le Whif may be their strongest showing, selling inhalable chocolate that Edwards invented several months before the establishment of The Lab.
Following such success, however, The Lab is looking towards an uncertain future.
It has partnerships with six organizations across the University, including GSD and SEAS, but has retained an independent existence, receiving funding from each of its partner organizations.
By its third year, reads The Labs’ website, the initiative expects that “the engineering school and the design school will make the lab at Harvard a part of the curriculum.”
“We are beginning to explore, with the encouragement of the deans of SEAS and the GSD, how The Lab might evolve into a longer-term design and innovation resource for courses more broadly on campus, and particularly in SEAS and GSD,” Edwards writes in an e-mail to The Crimson.
But according to Van Vuuren, The Lab’s uniquely independent position may work either for or against its final reevaluation at the end of the three-year experimentation period.
He also added that The Lab plans to use the coming two years to spread its influence across campus.
“Nearing the end of the first year, I think it can be said that we’re all very delighted with how the experiment has gone,” Edwards writes. “Over the next couple years we will broaden the programming and hopefully see one or two more lasting exhibitions with national and even international resonance.”
“It’s an exciting time at Harvard,” Lin says. “Everyone is trying to reach out to different fields.”
WILLY WONKA MEETS SCIENCE
The Lab originated from a SEAS class that students describe as a Willy Wonka-like factory, taught by Edwards, the Le Whif-inventing professor.
Engineering Sciences 147: “Idea Translation: Effecting Change through the Arts and Sciences” is a fall term class that focuses on how “idea creations evolve from a passionate will to effect change,” according to the course description.
Nworah B. Ayogu ’10 attended the class and has continued to be involved with The Lab. He describes Edwards as chic and eccentric. “I would love to see the inside of his mind,” he says.
The Lab, Ayogu explains, offers a niche for his unique scientific approach. “Think Willy Wonka meets science, and we all sort of have the golden tickets,” Ayogu says.
Ayogu is currently part of a group that is in the process of developing an SMS mobile technology that assesses the seriousness of illnesses by a diagnostic algorithm that deciphers the patient’s medical emergencies through text messaging.
“We believe that patients can be empowered to care for [themselves],” says Ayogu.
This summer, Ayogu will be conducting a pilot study of the project along with his group members, each of whom comes from a different academic background.
In its first experimental year, The Lab has extended across the academic fields of the University.
This semester, in addition to the Silent LED Rave, The Lab has helped host a series of panels and exhibitions, including “Sex, America,” a VES thesis exhibition in collaboration with Nayeli E. Rodriguez ’10, a former Crimson arts editor, and Cambridge Science Festival’s “Big Ideas for Busy People,” as it unites the sciences with the arts at Harvard.
“It’s about identifying what resources you have and what gaps you have, and you reach out,” says Ayogu, a neurobiology concentrator. “We leverage each other’s skills and work together towards a common goal.”

In a joint statement issued on Monday afternoon, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and the University announced the topics currently being discussed in negotiations  in an effort to maintain a sense of transparency in the process, according to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger.
“The joint statement represents an effort by the Union and the University to make the negotiating process as transparent and as engaging for our members and members of the community as we can, while at the same time protecting the process with some confidentiality,” Jaeger said.
In addition to a central “Main Table” discussion focusing on economic issues, members of HUCTW and the University have broken up into five Working Groups to discuss “policy questions of mutual interest”, according to the statement.
The five Working Groups—Article I and Employee Participation, Bargaining Unit Questions, Career Mobility, Layoffs and Work Security, and Mutually Beneficial Cost Savings—are currently engaged in discussions which will be integrated into Main Table conversations, according to the statement.
The statement made almost no reference to the University’s current financial difficulties—which caused the layoffs of about 100 HUCTW members in the past year—except for a mention of “some negative external factors.”
The statement also referenced the history of good relations between the Union and the University, which was the subject of an open letter the Union sent out in March, marking the beginning of negotiations.
Before negotiations began, University and HUCTW negotiators took part in training sessions on “effective negotiations and Union-management partnership,” according to the statement.
The University and the Union began designing the format for negotiations earlier this winter so as to ensure that the negotiations are productive, the statement said.
“The structure that we designed for the negotiations is working well,” Jaeger said. “We’re taking on the issues that are set up in that structure with good energy and making some progress.”
HUCTW and the University plan to arrive at a contract agreement by June 30.
HUCTW ratified its first contract with Harvard in 1989 after a protracted struggle to gain recognition from the University.

Mexico’s President Felipe Calderón will deliver this year’s commencement address to Harvard Kennedy School graduates on May 26.
Though the Kennedy School did not request a specific topic for the address, Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood said that he “would expect and hope” that Calderón, a former Mason Fellow at the Kennedy School who graduated with a MPA in 2000, speak about public service.
Now in the fourth year of his six-year term, Calderón has managed to reform Mexico’s tax system and public pension fund as well as overhaul the electoral laws since he took office in 2006.
“He has tackled very, very difficult challenges in Mexico, and I admire the courage he has shown in doing that,” Ellwood said.
Ellwood said that he heard Calderón speak at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where the leader urged governments and corporations to pool together resources to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
“He was quite inspirational,” recalled Ellwood, who had met with Calderón before.
Calderón has also served as secretary of energy under former President Vicente Fox and president of the National Action Party’s national executive committee.
Calderón previously addressed the Kennedy School in Feb. 2008, defending his first year in office to a packed audience at the Institute of Politics.
The specific hour of Calderón’s address this year has yet to be determined, and the event will not be open to the public.

During a discussion about whether the Registrar’s Office should require course leaders to opt into three-hour exams at the end of the semester—a motion that the Faculty ultimately passed—History Professor Charles S. Maier ’60 inadvertently admitted to giving students a take-home exam during exam period.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who spearheaded the discussion, explained the rules for exam period and reading period.
During exam period, he said, major papers and projects are not permitted to be due.
In his second question on the topic, Maier said that he generally gives his students a two-day take-home exam at the end of his course.
“I understand that they can consult their books. The effort is to make them synthesize [the course material],” he said.
“Are you saying under this proposal I can no longer do that? Because if so, I can’t possibly support it,” he continued.
“No, not at all,” Harris said. “I mean, I assume...are you doing that during exam period, or reading period?”
“No, ah, oh,” Maier said. “At the end of reading period I send it out. I put something online and I say pick a 48-hour interval...and turn it in 48 hours after you open it.”
“So, I would say if the due date is during exam period, it does run afoul with existing rules, but this proposal has nothing to do with it,” Harris replied.
“I will clean up my act there,” Maier said to laughter. “But if it is due at the end of reading period...”
Then Maier would be in line with existing rules, Harris confirmed.
University President Drew. G. Faust, who moderates Faculty meetings, then asked the Faculty, “Do you have any other confessions?”
AND THE AWARD GOES TO...
The final Faculty meeting of the year marked the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ equivalent to a field day, where faculty were honored with applause for professorial excellence.
As FAS Dean Michael D. Smith read over 20 names aloud, faculty stood to clap for their peers in a gathering that Smith said “probably made quorum.”
Five professors were named Harvard College Professors: Professor of Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics Michael P. Brenner, Slavic Languages and Literatures Professor Julie Buckler, Classics and History Professor Emma Dench, History Professor Peter E. Gordon, and Human Evolutionary Biology Professor Daniel E. Lieberman.
Smith also announced the newly elected members of the Faculty Council: Economics Professor Jerry R. Green,  German Art and Culture Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger, Associate Professor of History Maya Jasanoff, Philosophy Professor Sean D. Kelly, Professor of Biological Oceanography James J. McCarthy, and Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature Karen L. Thornber.
Over ten professors were honored with teaching and mentoring awards—including the John H. Marquand Award for Exceptional Advising and Counseling, the Roslyn Abramson Award, the Joseph R. Levenson Memorial Teaching Prize, and the Everett Mendelsohn Excellence in Mentoring Award.

The body of a man in his forties found in the Charles River near Downtown Boston and the Esplanade early Monday morning has been tentatively identified, but authorities are withholding the decedent’s name pending contacting his family, since there was no evidence of foul play, a spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney’s office said yesterday.
Although the body was recovered by  the Boston Fire Department responding to a call from a passerby, the State Police detective unit from the Suffolk County District Attorney’s office is handling the investigation. Under Mass. law, State Police under the state’s various District Attorney’s Offices are responsible for death investigations occurring in the state waterways within their jurisdictions.
There was no indication on the body or in the vicinity of foul play, said Jake Wark, the spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office. The body, which did not appear to have been in the water for an extended period of time, showed no signs of trauma.
An autopsy did not disclose any sign of hidden trauma or internal injuries, Wark said. Results from a further autopsy, which will include toxicology and other specialized testing, could take several weeks or even a few months to be gathered.
Bodies are found in the Charles several times a year.
“It happens more than I once would have thought,” Wark said.
“Frequently they are men and women who are homeless. Occasionally they are the result of suicide attempts,” Wark said. “It’s rare that foul play is involved, but we do investigate each case in the event that a crime has been committed.”
Water quality in the Lower Basin, the area downstream of the Watertown Dam where the body was found, is generally good compared to other parts of the Charles, according to Julie D. Wood, a Watershed scientist at the Charles River Watershed Association (CRWA).
The appearance of a body in the water should not have a major impact upon water quality, Wood said.
“It’s an isolated incident...if you think of [the body] as a pollution source, it’s relatively small compared to the size of the River.”
Though the body may not affect water quality, swimming in the River is still discouraged for the majority of the year. In the 2009 the Lower Basin met the Massachusetts swimming standard for about half of the dry season. All samples from the area met less strict boating standards.
Citizens can find current water quality data on the CRWA’s website.

Harvard’s yield may climb above 76 percent this year, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 announced Monday.
Of the 2,110 students admitted on April 1 to the Class of 2014, Fitzsimmons said that 1,604—seventy-six percent—have accepted the offer.
Deliberations on the waitlist began yesterday and will be completed by July 1. Fitzsimmons predicted that 65 to 75 students will be accepted from the waitlist this year, a decrease from recent years.
The percentage of waitlisted students who accept an offer of admission is generally higher than those admitted in the first round of decisions, Fitzsimmons said, sometimes topping 90 percent. These students’ decision to remain on the waitlist indicates their interest in attending Harvard if accepted. Thus, their addition to the class will likely cause the yield to top the 76 percent mark where it has remained for the past two years.
The target class size, Fitzsimmons said, is 1,667 students.
Twenty-six students have announced their intention to defer admission for a year, and Harvard counts these students as not enrolling for the purposes of calculating its yield. Fitzsimmons predicted that the number of students who choose to take a year off “will get up a good deal higher” before the fall; in an average year, 30 to 50 admitted freshmen choose to defer matriculation.
“Obviously there are all kinds of moving parts to this,” Fitzsimmons said. “There are occasionally some people who for a good reason say ‘no’ the first time and with later information feel that Harvard is now a possibility for them. Also, people who are currently committed to coming decide to defer admission.”
A few students who received admission offers from another college’s waitlist might also choose not to attend Harvard, he added.
As predicted in late March, more than 60 percent of the anticipated Class of 2014 will receive need-based financial aid from the College, as the undergraduate financial aid budget reaches a record high of $158 million next year.

Former Iowa Senator John C. Culver ’54 will serve as the interim director of the Institute of Politics, Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 announced in a statement yesterday.
Culver—who has been a member of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee since 1975 and has served as a chair of the committee for 14 years—will take over on July 1 when current IOP Director Bill Purcell steps down to begin working as an advisor on the University’s expansion into Allston.
The Kennedy School will finish organizing a committee to lead the search for Purcell’s permanent replacement this week, according to Ellwood. He said he expects that the new permanent director will not be chosen before the fall.
Culver, who is also a graduate of Harvard Law School, represented Iowa’s second district in Congress for five terms before serving as a Democratic Senator from 1975 to 1981. After leaving Congress, Culver was a Resident Fellow at the IOP during the spring of 1981. He has since served as a senior partner at the Washington, D.C. law firm Arent Fox.
His decades-long connection to the IOP, from his time as a Fellow to his long tenure on the Advisory Committee, will make this transition easier, according to IOP President P. Kenzie Bok ’11. Bok added that given the long-term nature of many IOP programs, Culver’s familiarity with these projects will allow for greater continuity.
“He comes in understanding completely what we do and how it affects the world,” Purcell said. “My sense is that he is in a position to lead from day one.”
Culver said in a statement that he has enjoyed his time on the Senior Advisory Committee and that he looks forward to working more closely with IOP students and staff as interim director. This deep interest in the work of the IOP will help Culver in his new role, according to Purcell.
“He loves this Institute, he loves this University, and he knows our students and the careers they’re thinking about better than anyone else,” Purcell said.
The IOP, along with the Phillips Brooks House Association, honored Culver’s dedication to the IOP last month through the creation of the John Culver Award for Service and Politics, which honors a graduating senior who has shown a dedication to both pursuits.
Culver’s own diverse public service experiences, from his time in Congress to his service in the U.S. Marine Corps, will bring a new perspective to the IOP, according to Bok.
“He’s had a very long and very successful career and he still remembers everything like it was just yesterday,” Bok said. “He talks about his career in public service in a way that inspires you to want to pursue that career yourself.”
“Senator Culver’s deep, long-standing connection to the IOP, combined with his many years of dedicated service on Capitol Hill, as a practicing attorney, and in the U.S. military makes him an excellent choice and a superb role model for students,” Ellwood said in a statement.

Economics Professor Emmanuel Farhi, who focuses on macroeconomics, was awarded tenure by University President Drew G. Faust yesterday. His appointment follows Faust’s late April announcement that Economics Professor Gita Gopinath, who studies international economics, would also receive tenure for next year.
The two professors, both under 40 years of age, will increase the vitality of the department, according to Department Chair John Y. Campbell.
“The quality of any department depends on the vitality of the faculty”, Campbell said.  “When you have the opportunity to offer a junior faculty member tenure, you have the chance to improve that vitality.”
Offers of tenure at other universities for each of the professors prompted the department, which had noted each professor’s research work, to offer tenure to Farhi and Gopinath, Campbell said.
Farhi is currently weighing his options between tenured positions at Princeton and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Gopinath is reviewing offers of tenure from Yale College and Stanford Graduate School of Business.
Both professors were tenure-track faculty at Harvard, so the department thought this time would be an appropriate time to react, Campbell said.
Gopinath’s current work looks at data that was previously kept from the public domain, reviewing detailed numbers that calculate aggregate price indices­—the first type of academic research in this area, according to Gopinath.
“For the longest time, we’ve been looking at aggregate price data, but we wanted to look at micro-data that are used to put together the aggregate price data,” said Gopinath, who plans to return to her previous research on the functioning of debt overhang economies and apply her findings to Greece’s current debt-heavy financial situation.
Farhi—who concentrates on macroeconomics in various types of finance—is currently reviewing social insurance policy and examining the reasons for the contrast of trade deficits in developed countries and trade surpluses in developing nations, he said.
This examination will lead to Farhi’s new intermediate level class next year, “Macroeconomic Policy in the Global Economy,” which will develop simple models to determine the effects of the “large macro problems that we face today about the [American] and European debt crises,” Fahri said.

David L. Howell, currently a professor of Japanese Studies at Princeton University, will join the East Asian Languages and Civilizations Department in July.
“It’s a real coup for Harvard,” said Susan J. Pharr, a professor of Japanese politics.  Howell will be joining History Professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74 and Assistant Professor of History Ian J. Miller, who are also Japan historians. He will be replacing Professor Harold Bolitho, a former professor of Japanese History who focused on early modern Japan.
Howell is “one of the finest archival historians in the study of Japan and East Asia”, said Ian J. Miller, an assistant professor of history. Howell views Japan from the margins looking in, instead of the traditional view of the political city looking out, said Helen Hardacre, a professor of Japanese religions and society.
Howell is regarded as a great teacher who is very involved with both undergraduate and graduate students. As a graduate student at Columbia University, Miller used to travel to Princeton once a week to take Howell’s classes. “It was one of the best educational experiences of my graduate career,” Miller said.
“He is a really nice guy who students will gravitate towards in a big way,” Hardacre said. At Harvard, Howell will teach a course for undergraduates focusing on Japan during the Tokugawa Period. He will also co-teach a General Education course that will likely be called Societies of the World 13: “Japan: Tradition and Transformation,” said Gordon, who will teach the course with Howell. Howell will give the lectures for the first-half of the course about early modern Japan.
Howell has other ideas about smaller, specialized classes for undergraduates, such as a course about the city of Edo, which was renamed Tokyo in 1868, Howell said. Although Howell will probably not be able to teach a freshman seminar for three or four years, he said he would like to teach a freshman seminar on the samurai or on Edo at Harvard.
Next year, Howell will be living in a faculty apartment in Mather House, he said. His son will be a senior in high school, so Howell’s wife will stay in Princeton with him, Gordon said. Howell said he will eat in the dining hall sometimes and participate in House activities. He said he will be happy to “give talks or engage in other intellectual activities” if asked to do so.
“In my field of Japanese studies, Harvard has always been the center in North America...and the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute is an international hub,” Howell said. “Harvard is a bigger stage than Princeton, so I’m eager to try my hand on the bigger stage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To find book offerings in Cambridge beyond the standard inventory of the Coop, it helps to peruse the city’s streets and read between the buildings.
Specialty bookstores carrying anything from used rare books to travel maps are overlooked but not underloved, subtly settling into the landscape of Harvard Square over the years.
In addition to the stories on their shelves, these bookstores’ histories are tales of their own.
BETTER WITH AGE
Raven Used Books on JFK Street very nearly wasn’t Raven Used Books at all.
“Originally we were thinking of calling it something ridiculous like Acme Books and Posters...but that would have been funny for about a week, and then it would get old,” says John C. Petrovato, the store’s owner.
But influenced by his former business partner’s love for birds and a classic literary enthusiast’s affection for Poe, Petrovato gave the name Raven Used Books to his first bookstore in Northampton nearly 20 years ago. Since then, Petrovato has opened a store in Amherst and, about five years ago, another in Cambridge.
The decision to do business in Cambridge was a provident one—Raven Used Books houses approximately 15,000 books and sells 5,000 books per month.
“There are probably less than 10 places in the country that could do what I do in Cambridge,” says Petrovato, who contends that Raven’s strongest section, philosophy, is perhaps one of the top 10 collections in the country.
As the owner of a used bookstore, Petrovato has a different outlook on the true selling point of a book.
“I don’t fetishize about books in the same way other people do; for me, the book is really about the content. It’s not really about the first edition,” he says.
Even popular philosophy books—not textbooks—fall on the cheap side. A philosophy book with a retail price of $200 may sell for $50, and very few books will sell over that price, according to Petrovato.
The Cambridge clientele is also refreshing for Petrovato, who had been accosted by New Age fanatics at locations in Western Mass. and informed that he had had a “violent birth” and “needed to be channeled.”
“People go to bookstores often because they feel like there’s always someone to talk to...like a bartender,” Petrovato says. “In Cambridge, people are really nice—they know what they’re looking for, they’re pleasant to deal with.”
Although Petrovato favors the calm of Cambridge, he has already set his eyes on new locations, having recently opened a store on Boston’s Newbury Street. He says he would like to open a store every four or so years, if possible, and is contemplating a store in Greenwich Village in New York.
GLOBETROTTERS
Behind the nighttime glow of its glass windows, the Globe Corner Bookstore at 90 Mount Auburn Street awaits curious travelers.
Enter Patrick and Harriet Carrier, the quiet couple who share their passion for travel through guide books and maps. Their dog happily greets customers from time to time as well.
Originally a subsidiary of The Boston Globe, the Globe Corner Bookstore’s first incarnation was in downtown Boston in 1982, Patrick Carrier says. At that time, the quaint shop specialized in books about New England and was a featured stop on the Freedom Trail.
After seizing several opportunities to expand through the years, the Carriers decided to broaden their inventory to general travel books, and by the time they moved to Harvard Square in 1988, the store’s name was coincidentally appropriate.
“I take great delight in people finding interesting and obscure books on our shelf,” Patrick Carrier says. “There’s a tremendous amount of effort that we [put] into it, and it only works if interesting customers come in and find interesting things.”
Harriet Carrier, who spends more of her time with the customers, recalls an 80-year-old man who once came looking for maps of straits in South America to plan for a trip as a member of the working crew of a three-masted sailboat.
“We’re very fortunate to be in an area where so many of our customers have very broad interests and very diverse travel plans,” she says.
And the bookstore aims to engage actively with the traveling community, hiring a staff of experienced travelers and hosting a travel blog as well.
“It’s nice to be a part of people learning about different parts of the world,” Harriet says. “It’s just a small part of increased world understanding.”
A FOREIGN AFFAIR
The largest foreign language bookstore in the United States in both content and square footage, Schoenhof’s Foreign Books claims eager Harvard language students, eccentric expatriates, cultured intellectuals, and former First Lady Laura Bush among its patrons. With over 454 languages in stock and an enviable lot rented from the Spee Club next door, it’s difficult to imagine that Schoenhof’s is itself an immigrant to Cambridge.
Schoenhof’s Foreign Books first opened in downtown Boston in 1856, when a market-savvy German immigrant recognized a demand for French and German books. The business transferred ownership internally several times within the next 80 years. Poor management and the 1930s financial crisis booted the store out of Boston and forced it to move to its current location on Mount Auburn Street in Cambridge.
A move made out of financial desperation turned out to be a blessing.
“There’s no other place now in this area, in New England—probably in the country—that we’d be able to survive, especially given the challenges independent bookstores face nowadays,” Schoenhof’s General Director Daniel Eastman says.
Although the bookstore was founded by a German family, French books have since become Schoenhof’s predominant source of revenue. “The latest, hottest French novel” is always the most popular item in store, Eastman says, especially if it has recently been translated into English.
Eastman notes that people who learn French are more likely to continue reading French books than are students of other languages and that French tourists or French expats seem to be more interested in continuing to read in French than people from other European countries. He also describes Boston as “hugely francophilic.”
Schoenhof’s interaction with the French community doesn’t end with its most frequent book transactions. In 1978, a large French publishing conglomerate took over the business, after which things took a turn for the worse. On the verge of bankruptcy in 2005, Schoenhof’s was again sold to a private family.
Only now, as Schoenhof’s debt begins to subside, has business stabilized enough to allow for considerations of the bookstore’s interior improvement.
“As you can see, it looks like hell,” says Eastman, pointing at the carpet and bookshelves surrounding him. “The store needs to have more of an ambience, to create more enthusiasm—to facilitate that concept about being excited about having access to the opportunity to explore the world a little bit through literature.”
'LABOR OF LOVE'
Ifeanyi A. Menkiti, born in Nigeria and now a professor of philosophy at Wellesley, is the owner of the oft-overlooked Grolier Poetry Book Shop, nestled behind the more prominent Harvard Bookstore.
Grolier, which opened in 1927, has struggled through several major financial difficulties throughout the years. Its second owner had just announced the shop’s closing in 2006 when Menkiti made the decision to rescue it.
“It was more like a labor of love,” Menkiti says. “If you had money to invest, the last thing you really wanted to do was put it into a bookstore.”
Menkiti, who can sometimes be spotted walking slowly down Plympton Street with a Dunkin’ Donuts coffee in hand, relies on his work at Wellesley to support his store. He is the first owner of Grolier to hire vendors to man the shop, he says, and his wife also stops by in the mornings to check on the shop.
Grolier often invites guest speakers for poetry readings and recitations—events that Menkiti says “encourage a meeting of world poets and world voices.”
Menkiti is himself a poet, writing about political history such as President John F. Kennedy’s assassination and South African activist Nelson Mandela’s life story.
“There’s so much that poets can do so we can accelerate the voices together,” Menkiti says. “That’s what got a crazy old man with the bookstore, when everyone is running away from it.”
Menkiti says he wants to stick with his little poetry shop, regardless of the difficulties of keeping it financially afloat.
“I know nothing about retail. I’m still trying to support this store,” Menkiti says. “I know there’s a lot of goodwill—people want this place to succeed so they can join this journey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jason Aquino, 23, one of the three men implicated in the May 2009 Kirkland House shooting, pled not guilty to charges of murder, armed robbery, and intimidation of a juror and was held without bail Tuesday.
Aquino is now the third man to face murder charges for the death of Cambridge resident Justin Cosby, 21, who was shot in the basement of the Kirkland annex on May 18, 2009, according to the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office.
Jabrai Jordan Copney, 20, and Blayn Jiggetts, 19—who, like Aquino, are from New York City—have also been charged in Cosby’s murder.
Aquino had previously been arraigned on charges of murder before prosecutors dropped the murder charges in Sept. 2009 in part due to the investigation's developments and witness statements.
According to the release, Copney, Jiggetts, and Aquino met with Cosby in Kirkland with the intent of robbing Cosby. Multiple gunshots were fired during the meeting, and Cosby was fatally wounded.
Brittany J. Smith ’09, a former Lowell House resident and Copney's girlfriend at the time, is also facing charges relating to the incident. On March 16, she pled not guilty to accessory and firearms charges.
Smith, 22, allegedly gave her Harvard ID card—which provides electronic swipe access—to the three New York men. She did not receive her diploma last May.
A second Harvard student Chanequa N. Campbell ’09 was linked to the shooting, but she has denied any involvement and has not been charged to date. Campbell was barred from graduation last May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students may be clearing out of Cambridge for summer break, but for the next couple months, Harvard’s athletic facilities will be anything but empty.
Not only will some Crimson athletes be sticking around for summer training and competition, but local kids of all ages will also be taking over some of Harvard’s sports complexes as part of the many summer camps taking place on campus.
Over 20 programs will be offered at the Crimson’s facilities for high school and younger athletes, and although there are no official ties to the university’s Department of Athletics, several of Harvard’s coaches will be involved in the camps.
Sport-specific programs include baseball, basketball, field hockey, football, lacrosse, rowing, sailing, soccer, squash, swimming, tennis, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, and more. Dates for each camp vary, but most run between early- or  mid-June and late August. The majority of the sport-specific camps are all encompassing, but others also offer position-specific programming.
The strength and conditioning camp, Athletic Performance Training, is geared towards athletes of all types and offers programming four days a week for up to seven weeks in June and July.
The camps will be starting soon, but not to worry, most are still accepting applications.

It’s senior sale time and Harvard Sells, a new website, proclaims to offer a solution to the over abundance of offers.
As soon as seniors started wrapping up what are presumably their last finals ever, House and club lists quickly saw an influx of e-mails from seniors desperately trying to part with their now unwanted possessions.
With offers of items ranging from futons to mini-fridges, underclassmen have been forced to sort through the onslaught of messages to find the best deals.
Students looking to fill their rooms as they prepare for a housing upgrade next year (yeah n+1!) have been sending out generic requests such as “Anyone selling a coffee table/table of decent size $15 or lower?” or “LARGE DESIRE FOR FUTON, PLZ FULFILL.”
Keito Uchiyama ’11, a junior in Adams house and a computer science concentrator, noticed that many of those e-mails were getting lost in students’ inboxes.
His new website aims to solve this problem by allowing seniors (and other students selling items) to upload sale albums from Facebook onto the website.
Students looking for certain items can then filter through the sale items via the search box.
Uchiyama put the Harvard Sells website together in around seven hours after his last final ended, he said. He decided to use Facebook instead of other sites like Craigslist because “people always trust their Facebook friends.”
Since the website was created on Saturday, it has attracted 1,674 unique viewers (a bit under one-fourth of the number of students in the Harvard undergraduate body), tallied over 14,000 total page views, and received 621 item submissions, according to Uchiyama.
The most popular searches are for futons, fridges, microwaves, and other common large-sized items. However, there are also some hidden gems being sold as well.
Uchiyama said that the funniest item he’s seen on sale so far is Jeremy S. Lin '10’s fridge for $50—it comes with a picture of Lin, a star Harvard basketball player, in action.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 12, 2010
An earlier version of the May 12 FlyBy post "Buying a Futon Just Got a Little Easier" incorrectly referred to Keito Uchiyama as a member of the Class of 2010. The correct year is 2011.

Zachary A. Young is finishing his sophomore year at Stuyvesant High School in New York, but unlike most high school sophomores, Young will be coming to Harvard in the fall as a member of the Class of 2014. He's 15.
Having already exhausted all the math and science courses at his school, Young, a fast-talking math enthusiast, thought he'd give himself some options. So he applied for college—as anyone in his situation would, we suppose—and was accepted to Harvard, MIT, and Caltech.
After visiting MIT and Harvard during MIT's prefrosh weekend, Young decided that he liked us more.
"I was generally much more impressed by Harvard's student body than by MIT's," he said.
In particular, Young enjoyed sitting in on the Math 55b: "Honors Real and Complex Analysis" class while he was visiting, and it'll definitely be a course he will consider taking in the fall, he said.
In his free time, Young said he likes doing math. He challenges himself with proofs and problems from previous math contests. He also has a girlfriend who is a high school sophomore as well, and he said she approved of his decision to go to college at such an early age.
Young said he'll miss the math contests the most when he transitions to college life in the fall, but he won't miss the busy work.
"I'm fed up with high school and how boring and repetitive it can be," Young said. "I'm very excited to try something new...I actually could feel like I'm at home here."

Tom Brady will be at the Harvard Stadium this June to play some flag football as honorary chairman of the Audi Best Buddies International Challenge: Hyannis Port.
The New England Patriots quarterback will be here on June 4 at 6:30 p.m. to kick off the weekend-long charity event on behalf of Best Buddies, an organization that aims to improve the lives of individuals who are developmentally disabled.
Brady will do what he does best—quarterback—for both teams of Best Buddies supporters and participants. According to Best Buddies spokeswoman Heather Schatz, Food Network star Guy Fieri will host a barbecue at the Gordon Track after the game.
"This is the first time we're doing the football game, and it's the first time we're doing it at Harvard," Schatz said.
The nighttime festivities will be followed by a 100-mile cycling event, a 5K run, and a 3K walk on Saturday starting at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, according to a press release.
Harvard was selected as the location of the event because of its longstanding Best Buddies chapter as well as the quality of its facilities, according to Schatz.
Tickets can be reserved at the event's website.
