After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Decades after the peak of his influence on the streets of South Boston, infamous Irish-American gangster James “Whitey” Bulger once again captivated Beantown with the release of “Black Mass,” a new biographical drama starring Johnny Depp as the notorious crime boss. During the film’s opening weekend, six out of the top 10 grossing theaters nationwide, including the highest three theaters overall, were located in Boston, which was exclusively responsible for almost 10 percent of the film’s opening weekend sales. Sharing the screen is Joel Edgerton as FBI agent John Connolly, a childhood friend of Bulger’s from Southie who guarantees him immunity in exchange for serving as an FBI informant. Throughout the following two decades, Bulger uses this relationship as a means of avoiding criminal prosecution while relying on the FBI to take down his enemies. This corrupt bargain is outlined at length by investigative journalists Dick Lehr and Gerard O’Neill in their novel of the same name, which was adapted for the silver screen by Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk.
Although director Scott Cooper (“Crazy Heart”) attempts to unravel the mythos of Whitey Bulger over the course of the film’s two-hour runtime, “Black Mass” frequently comes off as a redundant entry in the gangster film genre. The closest and most apt comparison is to Martin Scorsese’s 2006 Best Picture-winning film “The Departed,” which was similarly set in Boston and also loosely based off the story of Bulger and Connolly. But whereas the Bulger of “Black Mass” is eerily similar to the DC Comics character the Joker—brooding, sinister, and capricious—“The Departed” more memorably features Jack Nicholson as a degenerate, perverted, moral cesspit of a man. Unlike Nicholson’s Bulger stand-in, Frank Costello, Depp’s Bulger isn’t at all out of place at a friendly backyard barbecue with FBI agents.
To be sure, Depp deftly captures the spectrum of Bulger’s idiosyncrasies with a career-defining performance—he effortlessly switches from smiles and charm while escorting an old woman down the street to a cold face of ruthless pragmatism while gunning down a man in a parking lot in broad daylight. Physically, too, Depp transforms himself, donning Bulger’s trademark aviator sunglasses and popped-collar leather jacket, his slicked back hair mimicking the mobster’s wide forehead and receding hairline. Edgerton’s performance is worth noting as well, as he transforms from an ostensibly honorable lawman into a corrupt agent so completely co-opted by Bulger that he becomes an accomplice to the murder of innocent men.
But Butterworth and Mallouk’s script fails the rest of the film’s talented ensemble cast, which includes Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Kevin Bacon, Corey Stoll, Adam Scott, and Jesse Plemons (a dead ringer for Matt Damon)—all of whom play important characters that frustratingly do little other than service the plot. Key members of Bulger’s crew are given even shorter shrift by the script, with mobsters Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane) and Johnny Martorano (W. Earl Brown) simply written as generic henchmen. The film does include occasional moments of unintentional hilarity when the classically-trained and usually on-point Cumberbatch, who plays younger brother and State Senate president William “Billy” Bulger, veers into Seth MacFarlane territory with his hit-or-miss Boston accent.
Although Whitey Bulger was arrested in 2011 after spending more than 16 years as a fugitive—12 while on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list—his legacy clearly extends into the present day. Propelled by the reputation of its subject, “Black Mass” is captivating at moments, unflinchingly gruesome at others, and ultimately a clear indictment of the duo at its core. Despite its successes, the film is haunted by the shadow of Scorsese—and that makes its failings all the more apparent.

Alfred North Whitehead once called the European philosophical tradition “a series of footnotes to Plato.” In that vein, it could reasonably be said that academic philosophy today is primarily a process of footnoting rather than a process of theorizing. So original contributions like the theory that philosopher and cognitive scientist Alva Noë has set out in “Strange Tools: Art and Human Nature” are somewhat rare. That his thesis should be so compelling is downright extraordinary.
The theory goes something like this: Human life is made up of countless tiny forms of “organization,” which are generally ignored. Art, in Noë’s estimation, “is a practice for bringing our organization into view.” Imagine, for instance, door handles, a technology that organizes and enables a segment of human existence, specifically that part of existence that has to do with opening doors. But door handles are generally not noticed—they fade completely into the background. Now imagine a sculpture of a door handle. Suddenly, the door handle emerges from the background. A sculpture of a door handle displays the technology of the door handle, but more importantly, the door handle remade in art, according to Noë, displays our previously unnoticed methods of organization. “Organization,” as Noë refers to it, is broader than “technology.” Likewise, a choreographer can highlight a particular type of movement or a nature painter can comment upon the way a practiced eye sweeps across a landscape, and these, too, provide artistic insights on organization.
The greatest potential danger to such a theory is that it risks becoming just a theory of modernist art. With its trend towards abstraction rather than representation, its focus on the processes of human perception, and its tendencies to exalt the ordinary and make the extraordinary commonplace, modernism obviously counts as art under Noë’s theory. This perfect fit, however, makes it too easy for him to talk only about art in the last 200 years, ignoring the point that he is not necessarily so interested in less recent artistic traditions—Easter Island statues, for instance, or the portraiture of the Italian Renaissance. This produces the impression that Noë’s theory does not pertain to works which do not fit the criteria for modern or contemporary art.
Frustratingly, Noë himself falls into the trap of this assumption. When he runs through a series of examples of artwork in one chapter (“Philosophical Objects”), not one example is more than 75 years old. Although he is alive to this bias, his explanations for it are unconvincing. Past art, he informs the readers, did largely the same things as art does now, but audiences are no longer able to see how groundbreaking and innovative it was for its time. Although this is true in part, Noë is fitting his theory of art into modernism and not vice versa. This tendency leads him into pretentiousness when he has to address a potential challenge to his theory: that art is often comforting. “[An] invocation of the safe is itself a subversion,” he proclaims at one point, “for it is a defiant decontextualizing of those very values.” Sometimes an invocation of the safe is just that. And Noë’s is an embarrassingly inadequate explanation of the entirety of the artistic tradition. Nevertheless, Noë’s fundamental theory remains outstanding, despite his unfortunate tendency to rely entirely on modernism to support it.
Less original but equally important are Noë’s extended—and brilliant—rebuttals of the purely neuroscientific theories of art. In brief, Noë argues that such reductionist theories suffer from the same incapability to explain art as related attempts by scientists of vision. It is true, certainly, as neurobiologist Semir Zeki has argued, that the human eye can only perceive certain wavelengths, and so painters work with the color spectrum and not ultraviolet light. But this explanation cannot differentiate art from the larger class of things humans can see, and as such is hardly an explanation of the special appeal of art. In the same way, while it is of course true that everything humans perceive and think leaves a trace in the brain, neither the mapping of these traces attempted by Vilayanur Ramachandran nor Gabriel Starr’s analysis of the so-called “aesthetic response” explains art. Mapping traces in the brain, like diagramming the way the human eye perceives light, only explains the mechanism that enables the unexplained process of artistic judgment. And the aesthetic response is as unhelpfully broad a category, neurologically speaking, as things that people can see. Noë responds to neuroscience by advocating a theory in the tradition of Kant and Dewey. Rather than responses, he argues human reactions to art “are more like judgements…shaped by our knowledge and background and experience and the larger culture and shared attitudes and the ongoing dialogue among artists and experts and the rest of us.” Art is a shared project, requiring its audience to judge it through the lens of their experiences.
Unfortunately, the text is not redeemed everywhere from its theoretical shortcomings by a consistent and agreeable style, with Noe’s attempts to make the book more accessible than that of a conventional philosophical text occasionally ineffective. While much of the book is written in a pleasant and engaging tone, some areas remain far too dense for a lay reader. Even the cover summary of the book’s contents is exhausting, and the tendency of the book’s earlier sections to demand readers remember exhaustive lists in order to understand subsequent material is likewise off-putting. Finally, some of the vocabulary used is unnecessarily complex. When combined with his frequent use of slang words like “kid,” it produces a jarring effect.
But Noë must be forgiven these stylistic slips, for his aesthetic theory of organization is magnificent and spectacular. Considering his success in bringing the form of organization that is art to his readers’ attention, one ought by his own standard to count “Strange Tools” as a world-class work of art.

Nearly nothing is known about Italian author Elena Ferrante, except that she is Italian, female, and intensely talented. Despite having released nine novels to wide acclaim, she has refused to disclose her true identity or even reveal her face to the public, choosing instead to exist only as a thunderous literary voice. Her latest work, “The Story of the Lost Child,” displays this voice in brilliant form. The book takes the relationship between the narrator, Elena, and her friend, Lila, as its focal point—a relationship in which love, desire, affection, fear, jealousy, and anger all crash together like opposing weather systems—and then expands outwards into a harrowing storm of intellectual surprise and emotional honesty. Ferrante’s narrative style involves an equal amount of electric force, and the language she uses is just as compelling as the novel’s innovative content.
This novel concludes the four-book saga of Elena and Lila, a series which begins by chronicling their shared childhood in “My Brilliant Friend.” The opening chapters of “The Story” plunge immediately into Elena’s middle age, making few gestures towards overt exposition; even for new readers, though, the implied history quickly becomes clear. Elena and Lila, once close, have now become estranged. Separately, they confront similar questions of career, marriage, and motherhood: Elena, the narrator and a writer herself, has embarked on an affair with her childhood friend Nino at the expense of her young children, while Lila works as a computer programmer in their shared place of origin, an inner city neighborhood in Naples. As the years pass, Elena gains fame as a novelist, abandons relationships, raises children, becomes pregnant, and moves around Italy—yet somehow remains fundamentally anchored to the singular, manipulative, devoted Lila.
Throughout, the novel is remarkable for its startling and perceptive portrayal of human messiness. Elena reveals herself to be a sympathetic but deeply flawed character, by turns spiteful, neglectful, naive; like many of the novel’s other characters, she becomes achingly recognizable in moments of self-castigation and uncertainty. Considering the end of her relationship as well as the possible beginning of a union between her daughter Dede and Lila’s son Gennaro, Elena writes, “Anyway, the time of faithfulness and permanent relationships was over for men and women…Dede would live her passion, would use it up, would go on her way…The process was that: why did I want something different for my daughter?” The vivid, bitter exhaustion and confusion in Elena’s voice are surrounded by a piercing assertion about the futility of expecting secure human bonds. Similarly unusual portrayals of selfishness in motherhood, manipulation in friendship, and greed in one’s career will continue to appear in the book, each time with equal emotional resonance.
This psychological accuracy connects closely to the complexity of genre. Ferrante successfully handles an abstract understanding of possession in relationships, taking the idea nearly to a magical realist point when Elena continually sees Lila’s face in her brother’s. Eventually, Elena explains her understanding of the transformation: “[Lila] must have looked at [Alfonso] as a mirror and seen herself in him and had wanted to draw out of his body a part of herself…That work of Lila’s must have pleased Alfonso very much, he had offered himself to her like a living material and she had molded him.”
Ferrante is similarly nuanced in her exploration of disappearance as she weighs different forms of loss and rebirth against one another. At the start of the novel, Lila tells Elena not to include her in the narrative by snapping, “Forget it, Lenu, one doesn’t tell the story of an erasure.” She casts her life in terms of disintegration, and indeed plenty of her life evaporates over the course of the novel. However, the lost elements tend to re-emerge, albeit in unexpected forms. One broken relationship resurrects itself in another, separate, nascent attachment; a lost child’s features reappear on her mother’s aging face. Besides their own essential intellectual weight, these themes serve to make an original connection: that of old age to dynamic emotional force.
The novel’s wild intensity derives just as much from its language as from its thematic content. Long, furious sentences constantly modify and double back on themselves, occasionally breaking into lush, lyrical interludes: at one point, Elena writes, “If [Lila] didn’t stay alert, if she didn’t pay attention to the boundaries, the waters would break through, a flood would rise, carrying everything off in clots of menstrual blood, in cancerous polyps, in bits of yellowish fiber.” Ferrante’s poetic capabilities elevate the narrator’s harsh confessional mood without smoothing or taming it in any way, a pattern that remains consistent throughout the book.
Ferrante’s text seems a fluid, almost stream of consciousness narrative, but it proves much more intentional and complex than it appears. Far from being a simple dictation of events, Elena’s language reveals her own biases and feelings, even showing them to be in flux. Describing a lost relationship, Elena speaks with a palpable self-disgust even before she explains the cause of her emotions. Later, she writes of the same person with a faint affection, almost as though she has calmed herself in the intervening pages; as a result, the novel gains a whole new dimension.
“The Story”’s plot involves the same illusion of simplicity. It seems to flow linearly—to replicate life exactly—but it actually moves in tightly constructed spirals. Each cycle is a period of Elena’s life involving the people around her, her thoughts, and her physical reality, and each cycle is broken by some form of disruption. This event of fame, alienation, or loss then propels a new cycle into being. When the novel ends, it abruptly and dazzlingly reveals exactly how much change has accumulated over each successive round, leaving its readers to ask the same question as its narrator: How could we have possibly gone so far?

Located in the front lobby of the Institute of Contemporary Art, the Sandra and Gerald Fineberg Art Wall has been transformed in the past by artists such as Dave Muller, Francesca DiMattio, and Matthew Ritchie. When Ethan Murrow, an artist known for his photorealistic graphite drawings, was selected to become the next artist to enrich this space, it marked the beginning of a nine-month back-and-forth between Murrow and the Institute’s assistant curator, Ruth Erickson. Murrow and Erikson harkened back to this exchange on the evening of Sept. 17, when the ICA hosted a public talk between the two. After the pair touched upon the logistics of planning out such a project, the night opened up to an exploration of Murrow’s inspirations and ruminations on the nature of visual art.
For Murrow, the early stages of this project were the beginning of one of his largest and most novel undertakings. Accustomed to having full creative autonomy, Murrow had to cooperate with Erikson in order to find an image that satisfied both himself and the museum. “I spend a lot of time in my studio making work all by myself,” Murrow says. “And so to have to collaborate with her, and then collaborate with the team that helped me to actually make the thing is unique. It takes patience and you have to be humble and try and figure out what works for the museum as much as for yourself.”
According to Murrow, one of the first things he and Erikson discussed was the nature of the space he would be working in. The Gerald and Sandra Fineberg Art Wall occupies an offshoot of the front lobby that is disconnected from the natural flow of the museum. “It’s a funny space,” Murrow says. “It’s both really prominent, and it’s also an afterthought all at once.” Murrow said that he sought to develop a composition that would add depth to the space and draw visitors in. He and Erikson also wanted the visitors to experience an image that was thematically site-specific. Inspired by the ICA’s waterfront location, he approached concepts such as environmental changes within the harbor, flooding, and the history of Boston itself. In particular, he placed an emphasis on the fragility of the surrounding neighborhood through his seascape.

The result of this is an immense black and white wall drawing titled “Seastead.” The image depicts the wake of an aircraft carrier as it recedes into a vast seascape. Atop the vessel, the iconic St. Paul’s Cathedral lies askew. “We settled on this particular image in part because we liked the way in which it added drama to the space,” Murrow says. “This image is intended to be a kind of narrative cliff, as if something has just happened within the harbor, or this building has been stolen, or it’s being rescued. It’s supposed to be a sort of tip of an arc of a narrative.” However, Murrow wants to refrain from over-determining what that narrative is. “I’m hoping people will invent stories,” he says. “I have my own sort of tendencies about what [I] hope those stories will be. But I also recognize that that’s not the way art works, and people bring their own attitudes and opinions to it.”
He maintains that even an artist’s understanding of his own work can change over time. He is deeply suspicious of applying any finite meaning to an image, and this perhaps harkens back to one of his greatest inspirations: historical images. “I think that we spend so much time looking at history through singular images,” Murrow said. “We use singular images to try and stand for an entire moment, an entire era even sometimes. And I think that’s both sensible, because we have to try and come to some sort of conclusion about what happened—but I also think that’s really problematic, because then there is so much that’s left out.” This concept is one that Murrow returned to again and again throughout the night; for him, the way individuals experience images is as nuanced as it is mutable.

Karole Armitage is a world-renowned dancer and choreographer who combines various artistic mediums and styles of movement to create innovative and “modern” dance. She was trained under George Balanchine as a member of the Ballet du Grand Théatre de Genève in Switzerland before beginning her work in contemporary dance with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company from 1976-1981. Her first two pieces of choreography, “Ne” in 1978 and “Drastic Classicism” in 1981, were set to punk music and utilized eclectic costumes and neon lighting, earning her the title of the “punk ballerina.” She has since continued to break boundaries in the world of dance, choreographing for stage, film, and music videoes—including Madonna’s “Vogue” and Michael Jackson’s “In the Closet”—with subjects as diverse as the Audobon Society’s Birds of America and global climate change. She is a 2015-2016 Mildred Londa Weisman Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute and spoke with The Crimson from Kansas, where she is temporarily based to study the dance traditions of the Plains Indians tribes in conjunction with her research at Harvard.
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve worked with some of the most renowned dancers and choreographers of our time, including George Balanchine and Merce Cunningham. How did their different dance styles influence your own development as a dancer and choreographer?
Karole Armitage: Balanchine, in many ways, is the Shakespeare of dance; he did comedies, he did existential pieces, romantic pieces, history pieces—so he has this kind of range…and a huge vocabulary like Shakespeare. So refinement, poetry, expressiveness, musicality—those things really come from Balanchine. Then [with] Cunningham there’s a whole new way of intellectually understanding what stage space is, because he used…the stage as a field. So there’s simultaneous action across the whole stage space—very different from Balanchine, who really did have a central figure that was more important, or where the focus of the eye would be. So, in a way I learned virtuosity, poetry, musicality from Balanchine that I used in my choreography; intellectual adventures come from Cunningham.
THC: Where do you think modern dance is headed?
KA: Well, that is probably the million dollar question. I think dance is in a crisis now, because…cultural habits are changing...and this real investigation of what I would call pure dance is not the hip thing right now. You know culture goes in cycles, and it’s a tough moment…. Pure dance...deals in a way with more personal internal questions of “what does it mean to be alive,” “what is eroticism,” those in a way more ineffable, more personal spiritual questions are just not as written about…. So where I think it’s going is of course what I’m trying to do. There’s trying to bring a real funky democratic feel to the stage so that there’s simultaneity of action—you’re seeing real density and complexity but it’s also legible and articulate.
THC: To what degree is choreography an intellectual process for you, and how do you balance its intellectual and aesthetic elements?
KA: The way “On the Nature of Things” [a recent work on climate change] began was first with taking a long and very interesting text by this scientist…and reducing it to very succinct, important points…. And then there’s the research in my case of finding the music that would go from harmony to disturbance to really threatening, aggressive violence…a raising of consciousness, as people faced up to threat, and then returning to harmony…. And then you have to develop a dance vocabulary that shows harmony, that shows disturbance, that shows threat and violence, that shows developing consciousness, so all of that is a lot of intellectual research, to literally find the way movement viscerally gives the experience and the metaphors of these states of mind.
THC: You engage with many different styles, including punk and pop. How do you choose the music on which your choreography is based and how do you understand the relationship between music and motion?
KA: One of the most important things I look for in music is really a lot of space…because if the music is really full and intense, it speaks so much on its own terms that adding dance feels like making a cloyingly over-rich dessert…. It’s a kind of in-between. There’s a lot of independence; well it’s almost like making love—you know you’re independent, but you’re also interacting with your partner…. It’s paying a lot of attention but it’s being very free at the same time.
THC: Your work pulls from many different styles of dance and seems to avoid classification. To what degree do you seek to defy genre in dance?
KA: I think [my choreography] is fairly genre-defying, which is not a good thing when you live in a world that needs marketing…. But I’m just somebody who likes the grey area and who believes that people can hold contradictory ideas in their minds simultaneously, so I embrace that absolutely.
THC: With which particular areas of dance will you be engaging while you’re at Harvard?
KA: I’m working…on a project about Aboriginal culture from the Kimberley region of Northwest Australia…. This inspired me to want to think about our own country’s Native American traditions, which are so rich and complex…. So I’m in Kansas [temporarily] because there is the Haskell Indian Nations University, and I would like to do something about Plains culture, trying to bring a kind of performance and sense of the nature that created this performance.

The change in atmosphere as you make the left turn onto the pedestrian enclave of Thayer Street is immediately apparent. Puncturing what had been a backdrop of bleak, urban grayness, delicately laid brick paths and manicured trees lure passers-by in. Accompanying this stark change in scenery is an equally apparent transition in fashion. Whereas fellow commuters along the adjacent Harrison Avenue were clad in work attire as they headed towards the nearby Broadway T station, those pedestrians on Thayer Street are dressed to be seen. A man’s electric blue pocket square, painstakingly arranged to appear carelessly placed, peeps out of a beige seersucker suit to mingle with a woman’s elaborate black lace dress, while Johnny-Depp-like dark, thick glasses frames gaze down at suede monk straps. Seemingly insulated from the world around it, this cultural milieu is characterized by a cohesion of aesthetics and taste, marked just as much by its style as by its eager exploration of experimental new art.
I wade through the crowd, taking in both the substantial diversity in age and a seeming lack of diversity in race. Eavesdropping over the sound of shoes clapping on the pristine brick walkway, I dissect the vocational composition of the congregation: Boston’s art-collecting corporate community anxiously on their phones with their spouses, teaching artists from local universities here to support their colleagues, and fashionable young people meandering about with drinks, taking advantage of these Friday night exhibition openings as the free and classy parties that they are.
Miller Yezerski Gallery, like many of the 17 galleries on Thayer, migrated here from Newbury Street in the past decade. Its sterile white walls, exemplary of the “white cube” style of most contemporary art galleries, equally showcase the art and the costumes of the patrons. The staff demonstrates a transparency rarely seen in museums. A college-age gallery assistant dusts the works, while co-owner Ellen Miller sits in her office with the door open, perfectly open to discussing the “solid scene” of the Boston galleries. One of the two artists whose work is being displayed, Yu-Wen Wu, strolls around the small space, answering questions about her process and greeting friends.
Her show, “The Accumulation of Dreams,” addresses themes of immigration, transition, and cultural assimilation through pieces like “Orientations I” and “Navigating By Hope.” These gold-ink compositions of connected networks of hundreds of dots formally evoke Yayoi Kusama’s “Infinity Nets.” Tea is a prominent motif throughout the exhibition and is featured in one of the show’s most intriguing and confrontationally titled pieces, “Not All Alike,” in which gilded tea leaves are mounted in an evenly spaced grid to form a relief of enchanting, biomorphic forms.
In the adjacent room is “Shipwrecked,” a show of paintings by William Ciccariello, casually referred to as Bill by many of the viewers. Nine canvases, each of a single, beached wooden ship are labeled realist but hint at Romanticism, vaguely recalling Caspar David Friedrich. About two thirds of each canvas is devoted to muted, empty skies, highlighting the utter isolation of the ships, and effectively drawing viewers out of the gallery’s social atmosphere and into an environment of solitary hopelessness.
Directly across from Miller Yezerski Gallery stands the open door of Samsøñ, a hip, self-described “interdisciplinary laboratory.” Despite its pretentious inclination towards non-English lettering, the name is pronounced just like the biblical character. A highly social space, Samsøñ’s single room holds 30 people, who crowd together mostly in small groups of 2 to 4, convening in the center of the gallery, and occasionally glancing at the artworks. As the volume of foot traffic grows throughout the night, Samsøñ shifts from a site of contemplative viewing to a vibrant locus of unihibited socialization.
“Hummingbird,” an exhibition of new works by Todd Pavlisko, “focus[es] on motion and materiality with an underpinning of fame and sexuality,” according to the show’s informational pamphlet. The walls are adorned with photo-sculptures, in which Pavlisko juxtaposes Harold Edgerton’s famous scientific photographs with vintage basketball posters, framing tension and the ability to capture an instant in time as a defining components of photography. On pedestals in the center of the gallery reside hallucinogenic sculptural assemblages of violins melting over basketballs. Pavlisko works with luthiers to construct these bent instruments, allowing the violins to remain intact while they arch around the balls. Their curiosity and sheer coolness compensate for the underwhelming strangeness of what the pamphlet calls the “somewhat erotic” sculptures of Ray-Ban Wayfarers warped around the top of Orange Crush bottles.

Dr. Richard Berlin is experienced in psychiatry, psychotherapy, expert psychopharmacology—and poetry. He treats patients at his private psychiatric practice in the Berkshire Hills of Western Massachusetts and has published over 60 professional papers in scientific literature. He also judges the William Carlos Williams Poetry Contest and has published award-winning poetry chapbooks.
Although Berlin’s career in medicine and interest in poetry may seem an unusual combination, he is in good company. There is a rich tradition of physician-poets, which includes John Keats, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., William Carlos Williams, and Rafael Campo (who is also a professor at Harvard Medical School). Many physicians have turned to poetry as a way to express their experiences and use more creative language than is possible in medical charts.
Poet-physicians occupy a niche within the medical humanities, an interdisciplinary field which consists of endeavors to connect the arts, humanities, and social sciences to medical education and practice. Although many healthcare professionals, such as Berlin, attest to the positive impact that the humanities have on their medical practice, the medical humanities face significant critique. Students and educators at medical schools question the value and structure of humanities curricula, and academics debate about the position of the medical humanities—whether they are multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary and how it connects to other branches of academia.
Despite these controversies, the medical humanities are expanding as more medical schools incorporate the arts and social sciences into their curricula, more academics investigate this field, and individual health care professionals continue to explore how the arts relate to their work. In this atmosphere of development and controversy, it becomes vital that all of those involved in this field—patients, healthcare providers, and academics alike—are familiar with the current state of the medical humanities.
Medical school instructors often incorporate the humanities in order to foster empathy or diagnostic skills, which are essential for effective medical practice. For instance, Elizabeth Gaufberg, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School, leads seminars that focus on reflection through literature. She explains that incorporating the arts into medical education can “help the developing student figure out how to navigate both kinds of intelligence”—which she defines as empathetic understanding and scientific objectivity—“in the service of caring for patients.”
For instance, by discussing a text, medical students can reflect on difficult experiences they have had in clinic instead of attempting to ignore those experiences and closing themselves off from emotional engagement. Gaufberg explains that involving the humanities in these types of difficult conversations makes the students feel safer because “a work serves a kind of modulating function” and “you move back and forth between your own response to the poem and your own experiences in the conversation.” If the conversation becomes too intense for a medical student, he or she can immediately revert to simply analyzing the text.
Although Gaufberg observes students commenting more empathetically about patient experiences by the end of these reflections, she also acknowledges that it is difficult to empirically study reflective exercises. Because little quantitative evidence supports the impact of these reflections, medical students often question their value, according to Gaufberg.
However, other approaches to link the medical humanities with medical education are easier to empirically analyze. At Harvard Medical School, an elective course called “Training the Eye: Improving the Art of Physical Diagnosis” offers medical students the opportunity to hone their “visual literacy,” or observation and interpretation skills, through examining artwork at the Museum of Fine Arts. Empirically, students who complete this course exit with improved diagnostic skills; they produce more observations and more sophisticated descriptions about physical images during a post-course evaluation than during a pre-course evaluation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s something about music festivals—most people who attend them can relate that they’re incredible experiences, but it can also be hard to ignore the drawbacks to the staging of such large events. Festivals have a remarkable capacity to bring out self-centered behavior in their target millennial demographic—phone screens block out the faces of crooning performers while bodies force their way through the crowd past those who have been waiting outside for hours. Festivals are also vulnerable to the inevitable misery of adverse weather; multiple acts were rained out of last fall’s Boston Calling when a violent thunderstorm passed through the city. But amidst all this chaos, there’s a deeper reason people still flock to large festivals; they transcend the realm of pure entertainment and become a unique artistic amalgamation. The density and range of musical talent on display at a multiple-stage festival is, in the literal sense of the word, incredible. Boston Calling’s legacy is set to develop further this Friday.
The festival has wasted little time in establishing itself as a dynamic, populist event that works within tight temporal and physical constraints—every May and September, organizers transform the stark, boxy concrete of City Hall Plaza into a booming fairground where the bass frequencies can rattle your skull if you’re standing close enough to the stage. Like the Governor’s Ball in New York City, albeit on a smaller scale, Boston Calling has seen a rapid rise in prominence over the past several years and has become one of the city’s musical centerpieces.
The festival stands out not only for its substantial growth but also because of its distinctive vibe. This is due in part to its organizers, business partners Brian Appel and Mike Snow, both veterans of the Boston music industry. Both worked for beloved Boston radio station WFNX before it tragically went off the airwaves in 2012, after selling its frequency to the hulking media conglomerate Clear Channel Communications. Both men also worked for the now-defunct Boston Phoenix, an alternative weekly publication that covered the city’s art scene. No new publication or radio station has cropped up to take the places that WFNX and the Phoenix occupied as mouthpieces for Boston’s music scene. With Boston Calling, Appel and Snow’s agency Crashline Productions has given the city a new musical center.
The unique personal histories of the organizers are apparent in the structure of the lineup. Aaron B. Dessner, a member of the band The National, serves as a curator for each iteration of the festival. Dessner’s influence gives the small lineup an unpredictable nature, especially with respect to genre. For instance, after featuring rap acts like Run The Jewels and ILoveMakonnen in the spring of 2015, Boston Calling presented a fall lineup that does not feature any rap.
“It’s a combination of a lot of things, and we don’t necessarily go into it with a blank Excel sheet when we’re going to start booking and say, ‘This is our hip-hop slot, and this is our DJ slot, and this is our gospel slot,’” Appel says. “The lineup is a reflection, typically, of what Aaron Dessner and the curation team feel is important in the zeitgeist in the moment.” Consistent with that spirit, this year’s lineup is quite timely—for instance, CHVRCHES will release their sophomore album the day before they take the stage at Boston Calling. The festival has brought some big names to the heart of Boston in the past, ranging from Nas to Beck to Vampire Weekend to Neutral Milk Hotel, and this year’s lineup includes standouts like Father John Misty, The Avett Brothers, Alt-J, and Of Monsters and Men. “When Mike and I are standing there on the ground during the festival, we can’t believe the difference just in terms of efficiency versus when we started just back in 2013,” Appel says.

Alt-J is difficult to categorize. The band—founded in 2008 at Leeds University and currently made up of lead vocalist Joe Newman, keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton, and drummer Thom Green—has a three-year discography spanning musical styles from Southern rock to indietronica, winning it the nebulous and meaningless genre title of “alternative” and making it a perfect fit for the wildly eclectic atmosphere of Boston Calling.
Despite (and perhaps because of) this lack of concrete classification, Alt-J has enjoyed commercial success: Their debut album, “An Awesome Wave” (2012), won a Mercury Music Prize, went platinum in the UK, and sold over 1 million copies worldwide, while their second album, “This Is All Yours” (2014), was nominated for this year’s Grammys and BRIT Awards. Alt-J’s Facebook page declares that they “continue to excel as a genre-defying act,” and under Facebook’s “Influences” category, band representatives have offered an apathetic “Haha” (no word on whether Haha is, in fact, a musical influence).
In any case, whether it’s the steady thrumming of “Breezeblocks,” the loose Americana vibe of “Left Hand Free,” or the ambient experimental rock layers of “Bloodflood, pt. II,” Alt-J promises one thing—lots of blended sound layers. The sounds in Alt-J’s songs draw from commonly used instruments—a bass guitar and drums—as well as more eccentric ones—drummer Thom Green has used the back of a saucepan instead of a cymbal, and a riff in the band’s Bollywood-esque song “Taro” is played on an electric guitar using a roll of electric tape. With the support of oddly hypnotizing lyrics, often unintelligible except for tiny, rhythmic snippets—for example, a continuous repeat of “tralala” in “Fitzpleasure”—and startlingly evocative music videos, Alt-J creates a mesmerizing sound-visual landscape for listeners to explore.
Check this group out if you want to sound edgy when people ask you whom you saw at Boston Calling—then you can explain that the band’s name is styled Alt-J, which you can input into a Mac keyboard to get ∆, and maybe make a reference to the Illuminati. Haha.

Three years after the release of their first single “Lies,” CHVRCHES is no stranger to critical acclaim. In 2013, the group won the Inaugural Grulke Prize at South by Southwest and earned fifth place in BBC’s Sound of 2013 list for promising new musical talent. Rolling Stones hailed it as one of the few in its genre to do early-Eighties synth-pop well. What drives these successes is a distinct musical style that is immediately and unmistakably recognizable CHVRCHES. The clean beats, booming synth, and tender vocals are some characteristics that—according to Mike R. Snow, founder of Crash Line Productions (the organization that produces Boston Calling)—will distinguish the Glaswegian three-piece at the festival.
However, the CHVRCHES at Boston Calling might differ from past iterations—a move appropriate for a festival known for its unpredictability in line-ups and direction. When the band last came to Boston’s House of Blues in 2013, they were newcomers to the music scene; their debut album “The Bones of What You Believe” had yet to be released. Taking the stage on Sept. 26, the trio will have conquered 364 shows and will possess a new repertoire from their latest album, “Every Open Eye,” which will be released one day earlier on Sept. 25. Furthermore, the venue for this Boston performance—now a plaza instead of a nightclub—is much more expansive. “[Boston Calling] will be very much bigger,” says Iain A. Cook, guitar and bass player and vocalist. “I can’t wait to get back and play some of the new material.”
Still, the CHVRCHES at Boston Calling will be the same CHVRCHES behind the fresh, electronic “Lies” of 2012. According to Cook, the music performed remains a production that seeks to capture the spontaneity behind its creation. Their sound, as recent singles “Leave a Trace” and “Never Ending Circles” indicate, continues to seamlessly fuse light beats with weighty, honest lyrics. The electrifying pop triad might be more polished, but its persisting charm promises an exuberant, dynamic performance.

When MisterWives dropped their debut album “Our Own House,” Billboard characterized the venture as “explosive, larger than life.” The description is apt for a group whose discography includes a stripped, folksy cover of Drake’s “Hold On, We’re Going Home” and the sassy “Not Your Way,” brimming with sudden but smooth tempo shifts and a jubilant electronic beat. Yet while the New York City-based band’s music encompasses a diverse range of moods from jubilant disco funk to sombre ballads, MisterWives never ceases to infuse every song with a sincere energy—a quality that will no doubt manifest in the group’s appearance at Boston Calling.
But what drives this energy? Perhaps it is the music itself. Take the hit “Reflections.” It magically blends head-banging rock and marching synths to unexpectedly form an organic pop melody. Fueled by Lee’s powerful vocals, which fluidly oscillate from operatic to husky, the beat is surprising in its ability to avoid what would be, in less experienced hands, cacophony. This special quality fills every work in the MisterWives canon. The result is an addictive and kinetic sound that defies genre.
Or maybe it is the band’s commitment to performing an entertaining set. “We [want] to make it so that everybody has a good time,” says lead singer Mandy Lee, a desire that percussionist Etienne B. Bowler and bass guitarist William J. Hehir echo as the trio considers dancing and even crowd surfing during the show.
Regardless of where the energy comes from, one fact is certain: MisterWives will be rolling into City Plaza on Sunday to follow through on the Boston Calling mission, to provide eclectic music and entertainment. But that is only to be expected from a group that has consistently delivered a certain level of charm to even the most meditative of songs. “Bring your dancing shoes,” Lee says. “You’ll need a second pair.”

In a stark departure from the rousing, hand-clapping melodies of their 2011 debut album “My Head Is an Animal,” Icelandic folk-pop quintet Of Monsters and Men brings an unprecedented level of vulnerability and emotion to their sophomore effort, aptly titled “Beneath the Skin.” The group—which expands to an impressive size of nine for live performances—will return this fall for their first appearance since the inaugural Boston Calling in Spring 2013, making one of many stops on the North American leg of their tour.
The new album’s darker material may take longtime fans by surprise. The whimsically upbeat duets and frequent choruses of “Hey!” that so distinctly characterized the band’s earlier work have been eschewed for brooding percussion and melancholic solo vocals by co-lead singer Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, who now takes the lion’s share of vocal responsibility. The band’s classic first album track, “Dirty Paws,” no longer serves as their typical set-opener, having been replaced in most performances by the ominous “Thousand Eyes,” which features Hilmarsdóttir steadily pounding away at a floor tom-tom drum. “I lie awake and watch it all diffuse / Like thousand eyes,” she sings, as if in a trance. In the slow, regretful ballad “Organs,” she brings the album to its emotional core with heart-wrenching reflection: “I am sorry for the trouble, I suppose / My blood runs red but my body feels so cold / I guess I could swim for days in the salty sea / But in the end the waves will discolor me.”
Although much of the band’s new music feels mournful, imaginative woodland imagery still dominates their songwriting, and even the most funereal of tracks relies on simple yet catchy melodic hooks that make the band’s live performances incredibly enjoyable sing-alongs. Of Monsters and Men has the uncanny ability to rally crowds behind their uniquely folky blend of rock, whether it be with new singles such as “Crystals” and “Empire” or with beloved old tracks such as “Little Talks,” “King and Lionheart”, and “Mountain Sound.” With a variety of guitarists and percussionists taking the stage alongside trumpet and trombone players, the band manages to achieve an idiosyncratic live sound unlike any other and will likely take the stage at City Hall Plaza to uproarious, rhythmic applause.

“The songs are honest: just chords with real voices singing real melodies,” reads The Avett Brothers’ short write-up on the Boston Calling website. Those songs are also effortlessly organic. Rather than muddy up the flavor profile of their music with eclectic sauces and spices, the group lets the raw ingredients stand for themselves. Essentially, The Avett Brothers make music that is simple. And while their work may lack the technical sophistication of records put out by musicians in other genres, the simplicity of their music allows them to focus all of their energies on playing with passion. Their songs are comfortable. Listening to them is easy, and so is singing along.
Hailing from the woods of North Carolina, the band comprises guitar and banjo players Seth and Scott Avett—yes, they really are brothers—along with Bob Crawford on the double bass and Joe Kwon on cello. The band released their first album in 2002 but did not emerge as the big label powerhouse they are today until they released their 2009 album “I and Love and You.” They have brought their brand of roots rock to a wide audience and continue to climb the Billboard charts with each subsequent album release.
While The Avett Brothers may seem a more appropriate headliner at the Newport Folk Festival than in the urban center of New England, their arrival in Boston makes sense. For one, Boston Calling’s typically smaller lineup tends to lean toward a more eclectic group of artists. More than that, their arrival is timely. This is a time in which Donald Trump leads Republican presidential candidate polls by a wide margin because he represents a counterpoint to what The Atlantic calls “the current immoral situations that taint and threaten our blueprint of the American dream.” Many people seem to be especially anxious to return to simpler times, and The Avett Brothers provide just that.
“They are a reality in a world of entertainment built with smoke and mirrors, and when they play, the common man can break the mirrors and blow the smoke away, so that all that's left behind is the unwavering beauty of the songs,” their Boston Calling biography continues. So go to the center of Boston to get away from it all. For one set, the artifice of the city will dissolve and all that will remain is music: simple, pure, unadulterated music.

In her playwriting debut, director Aislinn E. Brophy ’17 brings stripping to Harvard. Revolving around the struggles of four female strippers, “Crystal’s,” Brophy’s latest production, will run Sept. 25-Oct. 3 in the Loeb Experimental Theater.
Brophy created “Crystal’s” after writing a monologue on feeling trapped by identity-based expectations, particularly those grounded in gender. Inspired by this experience, “Crystal’s” seeks to explore themes of womanhood and sacrifice. “I wanted to specifically write a show for women, and specifically one where women outnumbered men. A lot of things that happen in the show deal with what objectifying women does to [female characters] and how it affects their self-esteem and the way they think about themselves,” Brophy says.
For its female participants in particular, “Crystal’s” promises to offer complex roles that transcend stock characters and stereotypes. Emily E. Bergquist ’18, who plays the eldest stripper, Cynthia, considers “Crystal’s” to be a significant and compelling expression of female relationships. “You see characters getting in fights and arguments instead of this one-dimensional [idea of] friends being nice all of the time,” she says.
This is only one of the ways in which the play seeks to question orthodox attitudes. For example, body image is a central aspect of the show (hardly surprising given its subject matter). Members of the production praise the show’s willingness to embrace a variety of body types and its goal of destigmatizing stripping. According to Bergquist, “Crystal’s” steers clear of shame or avoidance of gritty realities.
The complexity of the female characters in “Crystal’s” has also proven a challenge for other members of the cast. “My character, Angel, is abrasive, nasty, irritable, and hates everything,” says Liz P. Kantor ’18, who plays another one of the strippers. Kantor says that she typically draws from personal experience when acting—something that has been difficult this time around—but the role has been particularly rewarding for just that reason. “I enjoy having to create her from the ground up rather than using my own experiences,” Kantor says.
Through the realism of the characters and the intensity of its approach, “Crystal’s” seeks to broaden the audience’s worldview on a relatively taboo subject matter, cast members say. Members of the production believe that Harvard students can learn from “Crystal’s” exploration of stripping as a livelihood. Julia E. Belanoff ’18, who plays Marjorie, another stripper, hopes the show challenges viewers’ prejudices. “We have such a narrow idea of what it means to have a profession,” says Belanoff. “I hope people walk away feeling empowered to take control of their own life, take responsibility for their own actions, and be open to their own bodies and forms of expression.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I don’t think I’ve ever personally encountered a case of cultural appropriation during my time here.
Of course, that’s not to say cultural appropriation doesn’t exist. We just happen to go to a school that tends not to host parties revolving around blackface, sombreros, and war bonnets, and live in a society that generally looks unfavorably upon those things. 
Yet virtually any casual Internet surfing will yield cries of appropriation everywhere. The very definition of cultural appropriation—taking up parts of a culture other than your own for the purposes of ridiculing it—has been expanded in the social justice lexicon to mean little more than identity policing.
Take music: the most active arena for these largely meaningless criticisms by the appropriators of cultural appropriation. White rapper Iggy Azalea is criticized for “affecting a culturally black accent and vernacular and flaunting physical features, like a large rump.” Isn’t loving and respecting the diversity of bodies something that this crowd generally supports?
For “adding in a racial element while she copied the dance moves of strippers and bellowed her love of drugs” in her VMA-twerking performance, Miley Cyrus was denounced by a writer for the Guardian who ludicrously sought to equate the event with the nonrealization of Martin Luther King’s Dream. “Cyrus’s act was less a homage to hip-hop and more a minstrel show,” the headline blared.
Huh?
Whatever sins the singers may have committed against our sensibilities, I find it impossible to mention them alongside minstrels and the struggles of the Civil Rights era, much less associate the two.
Of course, common to all these frequently trotted out equivalences is the absence of justification for their extremism—as if axiomatic, appropriation is treated as not only morally repugnant in its own right, but also as one and the same with racism itself. To even make mention of this missing logical linkage is to be guilty of “tone policing”—and the sands pile further on the buried heads.
The usefulness of the concept of cultural appropriation—to identify and denounce those who hijack other cultural elements for the purpose of mocking and jeering—is instead lost in a sea of self-indulgent denunciations that articulate neither a discernible principle nor actual harm.
Without explicit statement (for doing so would only make the argument’s flimsiness obvious to all) these shallow articles proffer a single, self-contradicting demand: that each race keep to themselves, and that traits traditionally associated with one cultural group remain with that group alone. It’s the same, ugly to-each-their-own conception of race we’ve long known, only now dressed in the frills and flourishes of political correctness.
How unfortunate that this disturbing trend has come to be associated with liberalism, when its core tenet is the freedom of ideas, allowing the best ones to triumph based on their merit. Instead, appropriators of cultural appropriation focus entirely on the style, not the substance.
It’s not enough that those who assimilate elements of other cultures are immediately assumed to be racist unless they claim otherwise, but even those who voice a sincere, clear, and well-intentioned interest are assumed to be insidious liars, their voices discounted and their intents assumed for them.
“Tokenization,” the critics proclaim. White people are simply “assuming everything but the burden,” co-opting blackness without having to assume any to deal with any of its socially imposed burdens. In the same paragraph, a blanket assertion is usually proffered that these people also don’t denounce those unfair prejudices, the implication being that they are secretly and sinisterly approving of them despite their apparent appreciation.
Not speaking about a moral wrong within any given speech or song is assumed to be complicity in these circles, which is, to use an overused word, problematic, since there are such an impossibly high number moral wrongs than we could plausibly denounce in a single setting. Yet that is the very standard by which Taylor Swift is condemned for inviting Fetty Wap to the stage and publicly announcing her admiration for Kendrick Lamar. Oh, the horror.
Look at any of the plethora of these articles populating and polluting your newsfeeds, and you’ll find the same fallacious logic pattern: white person (usually a woman, interestingly enough) is juxtaposed with a non-white cultural element—hence cultural appropriation, and thus the perpetuation of racism.
Quod erat appropriatum.

Today is National Voter Registration Day. Harvard College and Harvard’s Institute of Politics  have launched a non-partisan voter registration drive on campus that we hope results in all Harvard students going to the polls in 2016.
Participants in this effort will reach out through email, from information tables and by knocking on doors, urging their fellow students to register via Turbo Vote, an online registration website.
In addition to exercising their most fundamental democratic right and having a voice in choosing the next American leaders, Harvard’s student voters can also help reverse a disturbing trend of low youth turnout and disinterest in recent elections.
Last Fall, a national IOP poll of citizens age 18 to 29 correctly predicted weak turnout in the 2014 midterm elections, reporting that only 26% of young voters said they “definitely” would vote. The IOP also found that younger voters’ trust in public institutions was at a five-year low and that cynicism toward the political process was higher than ever. According to estimates following the election, just 21% of young people actually voted.
We understand how the current political landscape—particularly gridlock in Washington and its impact on effective government—can motivate discouragement. But in that context, we also know how vitally important it is that citizens exercise their hard-won freedom to elect responsible leaders. If we walk away from our right to vote, we imperil our future and our country.
We also encourage students to uphold Harvard’s long tradition of citizen-participation and involvement in U.S. politics. To help ensure that voting booths remain accessible to all Americans and that no citizen’s right to vote is inhibited, every citizen should be encouraged to register and go to the polls.
Harvard has long been at the heart of American government and politics. Nearly one in six American presidents had a Harvard degree. A huge number of our alums have held public office and served as leaders at all levels of government. Most recently, Harvard grad Elise Stefanik '06, a former IOP vice president, was elected at 30 as the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress.
Rep. Stefanik took up her duties in a Congress that also includes: Mia Love, the first African American Republican woman elected to the House and Tim Scott, the first African American senator elected from the south since Reconstruction. They represent a new generation of leadership, they are the future of politics, and they serve because men and women who knew and supported them made the effort to vote.
Nearly a half-century ago, former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy drove the creation of the IOP as a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy. At the time, Washington political reporter David Broder wrote of Mrs. Kennedy’s determination that “the ethic of public service that her husband [...] embodied and expressed, must be kept alive for successor generations” and that he would be “remembered for inspiring the belief that government and its handmaiden, politics, really are the highest of secular callings.”
We hope that every Harvard student will help keep this belief alive by registering to vote.

On Monday, the results of a sexual conduct climate survey conducted at Harvard and 26 other universities last spring confirmed what many already suspected: Sexual assault is an epidemic on college campuses across the nation, and ours is no exception.
The survey, a significant step in understanding campus assault, finally adds numbers to the anecdotes we hear all too often. Twenty-three percent of undergraduate women at the universities surveyed reported sexual assault or forced sexual touching. Harvard’s own results were, in many cases, even more concerning.
Close to one in three female seniors at the College reported some form of unwanted sexual contact during her time at Harvard. More than half of that number, 16 percent, reported completed or attempted penetration. Put simply—and shockingly—one of every six women who received a diploma last May was raped. Queer students experienced these violations at even higher rates.
The survey also found low levels of confidence among students in the administration’s willingness to take action against a perpetrator of sexual assault. 46 percent of female undergraduates said they were “a little bit” or “not at all” confident that campus officials would take action against an offender. Reporting rates, perhaps consequently, were very low: Sixty-nine percent of female students at the College who experienced penetration by force and 80 percent of those who experienced penetration by incapacitation, did not report the incident.
These realities point to flaws in the way the administration informs students of its sexual assault policies and the endemic distrust students have in effective University action. Stories such as an op-ed two years ago that detailed one student’s struggle with reporting her assault at the College underscore the extent to which Harvard must improve its institutional response to sexual assault.
Also worrying, final clubs were home to at least 15 percent of incidents of attempted or completed penetration by force and incapacitation. David Laibson, the chair of the Department of Economics and of the survey design committee, called this number an “alarm bell.” He is right. This adds urgency to the call for College-sponsored social spaces on campus, where all undergraduates can unwind in an open and safe environment.
Thankfully, President Drew G. Faust’s decision to talk directly with the Harvard community Monday night, along with her frank admissions that the results were “anguishing” and that “we have a huge amount of work to do,” is an encouraging sign that the administration will take steps to counter the blight of sexual assault at Harvard.
But demanding institutional action is far from a comprehensive response to the survey’s distressing data. The onus also lies with us, as individual students, to work toward stamping out sexual assault on campus. For one thing, it’s impossible to ignore that 64 percent of victims of unwanted sexual contact by force and 89 percent of victims of unwanted sexual contact involving intoxication reported alcohol use. This lends credence to what we all know: Consuming large amounts of alcohol in spaces full of strangers can increase the likelihood of sexual assault. Assault, of course, is never justified. Still, the correlation does show that by drinking more responsibly and encouraging our friends to do the same, we can mitigate its risk.
Just as important, 54 percent of students who reported seeing “someone acting in a sexually violent or harassing way” did nothing, while nearly 80 percent who saw “a drunken person heading for a sexual encounter” also did not take any action. Increased bystander intervention training would alleviate some of this issue. Yet it is also each of our jobs to look out for one another in social situations, on and off campus—to make sure none of our friends gets assaulted, or enables assault.
In his presentation Monday night, Laibson mentioned that he has spent half his life at Harvard. Most of the time, he has seen a place where students and faculty work and learn together, united by the University’s commitment to meaning and to truth. But this survey, Laibson said, has shown him “another Harvard, a sad and painful place.” The Harvard we experience is, in large part, up to us.

The modern rate at which sea levels are rising is comparatively higher than previously believed, Geophysics professor Jerry X. Mitrovica said on Monday during a lecture at the Harvard Geological Lecture Hall. The evidence, he said, comes from Roman fish tanks and ancient eclipses.
The data Mitrovica collected show that the rate of rising sea levels in ancient times was lower than previously thought. He pointed out that this made today’s rate seem even more concerning.
Mitrovica explained that wealthy Romans built cement pens for fish along the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea during the time of Emperor Augustine in order to keep seafood fresh until consumption.Today, they serve as indicators of sea levels between 100 B.C. and 100 A.D. The tanks were standardized so that they were neither too low—so as not to let the fish escape—nor too high—so as not to waste wall material. These structures can inform modern scientists about ancient sea levels.
Record on ancient eclipses yielded similar data. Mitrovica said that inconsistencies between water clocks, which were engineered to operate at a specific water level, and the time that eclipses occurred indicated fluctuations in the sea level.
According to Mitrovica, these data show that ancient sea levels rose more slowly than believed.
“Conventionally, the subset of these [data points] say that sea levels have been rising between 1.5 and 1.8 millimeters per year,” he said. “The sea levels actually rose at a rate of 1.2 millimeters per year. Some think that that’s a good thing, but it’s actually a bad thing.”
The troubling aspects of these data, Mitrovica concludes, are two-fold. In addition to showing that sea levels are rising at an even more accelerated pace when compared to times past, it also further implicates humans as the main cause of climate change, since the dramatic rise of sea levels in the past century corresponded with industrialization.

UPDATED: September 23, 2015, at 1:26 a.m.
A digital humanities initiative, pioneered by English professor Elisa New, is expanding to include a television series featuring influential figures discussing poetry.
The series will be funded independently of Harvard in part through a non-profit organization that New created and distributed by local station WGBH. The television show joins the "Poetry in America" Initiative’s three other components: a series of massive open online courses with HarvardX and collaborations with the Graduate School of Education and PBS Learning Media.
New, who took a sabbatical last year to focus full-time on the project, started to consider expanding the initiative soon after production began on the first of seven HavardX MOOCs, which are designed to give an overview of poetry in America from early New England to the modern day.
The MOOCs prominently featured interviews with New’s colleagues and other distinguished figures, such as Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, University professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Senator John S. McCain, University President Drew G. Faust, and rapper Nas. The guests usually discuss a single poem—John McCain, for example, gave his thoughts on “The Cremation of Sam McGee,” by Robert W. Service.
“When it became clear that I really was succeeding in having these conversations with really recognizable people, I went to WGBH and asked if they thought there was anything we could work on and they said absolutely,” New said.
The first television show will feature an interview with former President Bill Clinton—in which he discusses “Harlem,” by Langston Hughes—that New brought to WGBH with her initial proposal.
New said her initiative retains the use of its own videographers and course developers, who are paid in part by Harvard for the work they do on the HarvardX component, and in part by a non-profit set up by New to raise funds for the initiative. New noted that there were significant advantages to having her own video production team, including her organization’s ownership of the footage and their ability to shoot on-location at a moment’s notice.
Though WGBH declined to provide any details on the funding model for the show, New confirmed that she has secured funding for the first season and is hoping to secure funding and a contract for a second season soon.
“We explored [expanding with HarvardX] and I think HarvardX, in a really professional and crisp way, decided that what their mission was for the moment was making courses,” New said. “Of course there’s a financial aspect to it [as well]. And so I’ve raised a lot of money that is now in these various projects.”
“The simple reality is that Poetry in America…is much bigger than a HarvardX course now,” said Biology professor and Faculty Director of HavardX Robert A. Lue.“I think everyone would agree that the resource base goes beyond what HarvardX can do. I mean, HarvardX does have a budget.”
Beyond fundraising, New said she has devoted a significant amount of her time to the initiative, saying that she is now working “twice as hard as I’ve ever worked for no profit.” Part of the draw is the ability to reach far more people than she could through more traditional pedagogical methods, she said. The most popular of New’s MOOCs, the module on Dickinson, draws 1,000 to 3,000 participants a week.
“In one week, I have more impact than my books have. My three books,” New said. “These still are extraordinary numbers in my experience for a humanist to be reaching.”
“Increasingly there are powerful pressures in contemporary societies that militate against an interest in arts and humanities generally,” said English Department chair W. James Simpson. “That being the broader situation, it strikes me that what Professor New is doing is exactly right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
South African political activist Mamphela A. Ramphele explored the question, “can African women redefine liberation for all?” at the annual Rothschild Lecture held by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study on Monday. Ramphele described storytelling as a means of empowerment, urging African women to “weave new narratives.”
“The redefinition of freedom is most likely to be done by those who suffer oppression the most and are conscious of their agency to bring about change,” Ramphele said. “The persistence of a narrative of freedom that excludes such change agents becomes, in this case, a motivating force.”
Ramphele, born just before the beginning of Apartheid, grew up in South Africa and received a medical degree from the University of Natal, where she engaged in anti-Apartheid activism. Over the course of the past five decades, Ramphele has promoted her cause of liberation across posts in academia, public service, and politics.
In addition to her stint as a visiting scholar at HKS in 1994, she has also served as a managing director at the World Bank, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Town, and founder of the Agang South Africa political party.
The Rothschild Lectures have featured “visionary leaders who straddle the worlds of academia and public life,” said Lizabeth Cohen, dean of the Radcliffe Institute, in her introduction.
Ramphele insisted upon equality in terms of gender as well as race in post-Apartheid South Africa. She pointed to the alpha-male construction, a cultural motif in African societies, to emphasize that many liberation stories feature a single powerful male protagonist. Saying that women are too frequently excluded from these stories, Ramphele called upon African women to ask, “Is this all that freedom means for us?”
“The disjunction between a youthful population that is majority women being led by old men speaks to the old mindset that needs to be challenged,” said Ramphele.
In her analysis of South African societies, Ramphele said that gender inequality harms men and women alike. The male-dominated model of power sustains itself through the subjugation of other men, who in turn strive to dominate females, according to Ramphele.
This toxic narrative resolves itself through self-liberation, solidarity, and connection with others, and African women are in a strategic position to change dominating narratives, Ramphele said.
“History teaches us that change only comes when those who stand to benefit most stand up and make it happen,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the taxi industry voiced their concerns at Monday’s Cambridge City Council meeting with ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, that have taken away a considerable share of their business in the area.
The taxi business in Boston lost nearly 25 percent of its revenue in the first half of 2015 during the rise of ride-sharing services that lacked the taxi industry’s regulations, according to the Boston Globe. Cambridge taxi drivers in particular went on strike in August to protest what they describe as an unfair playing field.
“There should not be two different laws [for taxis and ride-sharing services]: there should be one law for the same purpose of work. We are heavily regulated by the city and they are not,” said Balwinder S. Gill, a Cambridge-based taxi owner and driver.
Gill stated Cambridge taxi drivers have sought recourse in local government.
“[The city councillors] are the ones who can change the law, they're the ones who can put [ride-sharing services] under regulations,” Gill said. “That’s what we’re trying to do.”
For his part, Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said that taking extreme measures to address taxi drivers’ concerns is not pragmatic—rather, a conciliation of interests would be needed to fairly mediate the situation.
"Uber is here to stay. It’s going to be legislated on a state level, so the taxi [drivers’] interest on getting UberX banned outright is not realistic, because UberX will find a way into the market legally,” Mazen said.
Mazen mentioned that three different bills had been introduced in the Massachusetts State Senate: one supported by the taxi industry, one support by Uber, and a consensus bill proposed by the governor. While the legislation is being discussed, Mazen said that the Council seeks a compromise that balances consumer and business interests.
Peter Valentine, a Cambridge resident, brought levity to the proceedings with his support for local taxi drivers and his advice for city councillors.
“Don’t participate in the chaos of change,” Valentine said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School launched last week a mobile application for students with resources related to mental health, sexual harassment, and student life. The app, called “THRIVE@HLS,” is based on a similar app used at Harvard Business School.
The app links to the phone numbers and contact information for the Harvard University Police Department, Harvard University Health Resources, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response hotline. It also supplies students with contact information for the Law School’s Title IX coordinators, dining hall offerings, and an events schedule. 
“Over the summer, we shared a beta version of the app with a group of HLS students and received their input. The feedback was positive,” Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in an email. The app became available for free on the Apple Store and on Google Play on Sept. 16.
THRIVE@HLS also contains a section titled “Who to call if” and lists a series of scenarios for Law School students.
The release of the app comes as the Law School rolls out its new process for responding to cases of alleged sexual harassment. Over the summer, the Law School put in a place a new set of Title IX procedures that, among other changes, provides students involved in cases with attorneys. The Law School’s system differs significantly from the process in place at the rest of the University.
In addition to the new app, the Law School will reach out to students about the new sexual harassment framework through a series of information sessions about the new Title IX procedures. The first will be Sept. 24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of an ongoing federal investigation and intensified criticism from its constituents over how Harvard College addresses and prevents sexual assault on campus, the results of a highly anticipated survey on the subject revealed a stark picture of campus-wide distrust and confusion.
On Monday, the University released the results of a sexual assault climate survey that Harvard distributed among students at all schools last semester. Compared to the other 26 colleges and universities that circulated a similar version of the survey, developed by the Association of American Universities, Harvard received the highest response rate, with more than 53 percent participation among students University-wide. 
For a college that has in the past two years been the subject of heightened internal, media, and federal scrutiny over its Title IX practices, the survey results yet again focused the attention of both campus stakeholders and outside observers on how the College specifically handles the issue.
Although Harvard as a whole had a lower incidence of sexual misconduct reported by student respondents from all its schools, according to the survey results, among undergraduates the rate was notably higher.
Thirty-one percent of senior female undergraduates at the College surveyed reported having experienced some kind of sexual misconduct—what the survey termed “nonconsensual sexual contact”—during their time here, which is several points higher than the average rate of all schools participating in the AAU survey. Sixteen percent of female Harvard College seniors surveyed, meanwhile, said they had experienced unwanted sexual penetration or attempted penetration involving physical force or incapacitation in that time.
 Further, survey results indicate that Harvard undergraduates lack confidence in the University’s ability to respond to sexual assault complaints. Compared to other colleges that participated in the survey, undergraduates at Harvard indicated significantly lower levels of trust in their school’s sexual harassment grievance process and increased uncertainty about the College’s resources and policies.
Only 16 percent of female undergraduate respondents reported that they believed Harvard was “very or extremely likely” to take action against perpetrators. In contrast, the same figure averaged across other schools participating in the AAU survey was 37 percent.
And even as the University overhauled its investigatory procedures into cases of alleged sexual harassment and increased resource allocation to several offices, according to the survey, students are still confused and hesitant.
Less than 15 percent of all Harvard student respondents are “very or extremely knowledgeable about how the university defines sexual assault and sexual misconduct,” according to the survey results. In addition, only 8 percent of Harvard respondents reported being “very or extremely knowledgeable” about the process after a student has made a report. Only 20 percent of respondents even knew where to file a report.
In the aggregate, the AAU survey results confirm previous, smaller studies about the prevalence and culture surrounding sexual harassment on college campuses, according to S. Daniel Carter, the director of 32 National Campus Safety Initiative, a group that advises colleges on campus safety issues.
“Overall it demonstrates what we've known for a long time: that sexual victimization in college and university campuses is extensive and vastly underreported, and lack of consent is an overarching factor in most cases,” said Carter, who has worked with Westat, the consulting company that administered the survey.
‘DEEPLY DISTRESSING’
The starkingly unflattering survey results drew powerful reactions of concern from top College administrators and cautious hope for change from unsurprised student activists on Monday.
In a stream of mass emails in the hours following the release of the survey results, University President Drew G. Faust called them “deeply troubling,” while Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana termed them “deeply distressing.” In separate emails to residents, College House masters characterized the survey results in terms ranging from “concerning” to “overwhelmingly distressing.”
The sentiment, it seems, is shared by students. Faust hosted a Monday night discussion on the results, and a crowd of about 150 students filled Science Center D, so many that attendees required an additional overflow room. Top University and College administrators, from Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith to former interim dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, attended as well. 
Students stood up to demand answers and suggest solutions to the problem. They asked about final clubs and their peers’ awareness of sexual assault resources, student programming, and freshman orientation.
In separate interviews, administrators reiterated their concern. Visibly perturbed, Khurana paused at times throughout a series of questions while elaborating what he said were “deep, systematic structural issues around safety” as well as the “dynamics of power” at the College.
“The fact that anyone... is subject to experiencing sexual assault and attempted sexual assault at the rates that we are seeing is painful and demands action,” Khurana said. “I’m still digesting actually the full gravity of what we are talking about here.”
Alicia Oeser, the director of Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, said she was not particularly surprised by the survey’s findings about sexual assault’s incidence on campus, given that they are relatively consistent with past data and her own office’s experiences.
“It doesn't feel particularly surprising on our end,” Oeser said. “It’s good that we are seeing the scope so that we can begin addressing it.”
Undergraduate student activists, although they too said they were unsurprised by the survey results, added that they hope administrators will use the data to make policies more transparent, bolster Title IX training, and improve accommodations for victims of sexual violence.
Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy group, said the data, although “damning,” reveal trends that University officials should have previously known.
“It's not the first time they were told that sexual violence is a problem on campus. They have a Title IX investigation open against them. This is not the first time they've had a Title IX investigation open against them. There have been incredible outpourings of student activism," Fournier said. "This is not a new issue.”
‘ROOM TO IMPROVE’
Beyond concern, the release of the survey results prompted students and College officials alike to note a need to improve campus resources and their communication and otherwise rethink sexual assault prevention.
Fournier suggested that the College needs to improve its transparency, further research social spaces, and ensure that students of all identities—such as BGLTQ and disabled students—receive necessary resources.
Oeser said her office is working on a “model around social change communication,” a graphic decision tree for individuals to identify various resources based on the point of intervention in a given situation, whether relational, cultural, or individual. She acknowledged the lower level of awareness regarding University procedures and resources demonstrated by the survey. 
“There’s a lot of room to improve the communication about our services and make it more available,” she said.
Other than making existing resources more accessible, one takeaway from the survey is the need to look closer at social spaces on campus, as well as alcohol use, according to the Harvard task force that analyzed the results.
Former Harvard Provost Steven E. Hyman, now the chair of the roughly year-old Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault, broke down the survey results to Faust in a report, urging several points of action.
One was the need to further study social spaces on and off campus and “effectively” address them.
Survey results from female College student showed that more than 75 percent of incidents of sexual assault involving attempted or completed penetration occurred in dormitories; with at least 15 percent of incidents, the second highest reported location was “single-sex organizations that are not fraternities or sororities”—a category that would include Harvard’s unrecognized final clubs.
As Hyman noted in his report to Faust, however, the survey did not identify where those incidents originated, and so he recommended further research to find “more concrete information about the role of physical spaces, including the Houses and recognized and unrecognized social organizations.”
Most reported incidents of sexual assault involving attempted or completed penetration involved alcohol. “Prevention efforts are not likely to succeed if we do not, as part of our final report, suggest approaches to decreasing the harm associated with student drinking,” Hyman wrote, referencing Faust’s request that his task force present her with a set of “detailed” recommendations for sexual assault prevention in January of next year.
Khurana, for his part, said a deeper understanding of the role that space and place play in sexual assault is necessary to understand the underlying factors and where unsafe interactions begin. In particular, he forcefully called out single-sex organizations for being unaligned with what he says are the ideals of the College, seeming to echo concerns raised previously by administrators about final clubs and the potential for sexual assault to occur on their properties.
“Harvard College is a co-ed institution,” Khurana said. “Any organization that lays claim on its membership, for its reputation, for its identity of being connected to the College, has to recognize the full responsibility of what it means to join Harvard College and its co-ed mission. ... I will not allow the word ‘tradition’ to be used to protect the status quo.”
Khurana repeatedly emphasized the need for Harvard affiliates to reflect together and work to improve problems areas highlighted in the survey.
The College will host a series of town hall events about the survey this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 22, 2015, at 2:41 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust stared out into a packed, silent audience Monday night. She was in Harvard’s Science Center for a town hall meeting, set in front of a crowd of hundreds of University affiliates concerned about the prevalence of sexual assault on campus.
Earlier in the day, the Association of American Universities released the results of a much anticipated sexual assault climate survey from last spring, and the results, in Faust’s own words, were “deeply disturbing.” Thirty-one percent of surveyed senior women at the College said they had experienced sexual contact without their consent during their time at Harvard, and 16 percent said they had experienced nonconsensual completed or attempted sexual penetration.
There was no applause or murmuring after Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, a member of the University's sexual assault task force, presented Harvard’s specific results. Laibson took his seat in the front row and Faust rose. For 45 minutes, she fielded questions from a visibly emotional and perturbed crowd, all the while maintaining a certain candidness and concern.
“I find these numbers anguishing,” she began. “Anguishing for the individuals whose lives have been devastated, anguishing for all of us who want to believe that this is a community defined by our care and respect for one another.”
Aside from her occasional meetings with Undergraduate Council—which do not often draw the same crowd or intensity—Faust does not typically field questions at length from undergraduates. On Monday night, though, she approached the task eagerly, scanning through an alert audience, handpicking attendants to share questions and often criticisms.
One asked Faust how she would characterize the University’s response to sexual assault.
“I think these numbers show it’s completely insufficient,” Faust responded. “We have a huge amount of work to do and we need to change this culture and these kinds of realities.”
Another undergraduate asked about Harvard’s plans for addressing cases of sexual assault in dormitories. Looking up over her front-row cadre of top administrators including Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Faust emphasized the importance of communal collaboration in tackling the issue.
“This is not just my responsibility, though it’s certainly my responsibility. It’s the responsibility of every single person in this room, and we need to make sure that this is not the community which we live in for very long,” she said. “We need to make this different, and all of us need to be engaged in doing that.”
Other students focused on final clubs—a topic about which Faust recently spoke out—and social spaces on campus, as well as orientations for students about Harvard’s sexual assault procedures and resources.
Faust’s answers made it clear that her distress over the survey results comes from a deeply personal place, and she elaborated on that feeling after the forum.
In an interview, Faust referenced the 90 senior women at the College who reported experiencing completed or attempted penetration without their consent during their time at the College.
“I just think that’s horrifying,” she said. “It just tears me apart, so I do see the individuals and that's why it makes me so upset.”
In recent years, Harvard and other universities across the nation have come under scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Education, especially surrounding Title IX and administrative responses to sexual assault.
On a campus where change is often slow, Faust seems committed to rallying Harvard students, faculty, and affiliates around this issue. In April 2014, she convened a task force focused on sexual assault and misconduct in response to these concerns, and she has followed the advice it has offered, such as increasing funding for the student sexual assault support services. In July 2014, Harvard unveiled a new University-wide sexual assault policy and procedures, as well as a centralized investigatory office for complaints, the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution.
Some of those changes have faced criticism, but on Monday night, Faust promised further meetings and forums.
“It still makes me sad that this is something that troubles this university and these individuals and all of us so very deeply,” she said afterwards. “It shouldn’t. It’s not the institution, it’s not the community I want Harvard to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 22, 2015, at 4:20 a.m.
Breaking a record is no easy feat. Playing a pivotal role in setting a single-game team point record at your first home game, in your first season, against your archrivals, is monumental.
Such was the case for freshmen Sarah Lipson, Susie Clements, and Caitlin Weigel, as the Harvard women’s rugby team thrashed Yale, 111-5, in its Ivy opener on Saturday. This is the first time that Harvard has allowed points to Yale since becoming a varsity squad; in the two prior meetings, the Crimson thrashed the Elis by a combined score of 138-0.
Though the win was undoubtedly a team effort with 14 players scoring tries, the trio of freshman stood out for their individual efforts in the win: both Lipson and Weigel recorded a game-high three tries, and Clements executed seven conversions and a try of her own.
“All of our freshmen this year who have seen playing time have just made an enormous contribution to the team,” co-captain Hope Schwartz, a former Crimson sports editor, said. “Over the past couple of years we’ve graduated some pretty talented seniors, so to have people come on the team and right away start to make an impact like they have has really elevated our level of play.”
This season marks the first time a recruited class takes the field for the women’s rugby team, as the team has only been varsity for two years.
That impact was visible from the start of the match on Saturday. Within three minutes of kickoff, Clements passed the ball to Weigel, who broke through the Bulldogs' defenders for the first try of the game. Later on in the first half, Clements again took possession of the ball out wide and passed it to Lipson, who scored another try for the Crimson.
“Offensively we attacked really strong, we just kept driving our legs,” Weigel said. “I’m really happy with my performance, especially in the second half. I’m also very critical of myself sometimes, but I’m really happy with how, as the game went on, I got more comfortable and better.”
Wiegel, a two time All-American and Ohio native, has been playing rugby since her sophomore year of high school.
A long kick from Clements and an ensuing try from Weigel highlighted the second half. The long kick from Clements bounced over a Yale defender into the arms of Wiegel, who would run it in for one of the best tries of the match, breaking the 90-point mark for Harvard. Clements repeated that success in another downfield kick that Lipson managed to score off.
Clements, who played for Scotland’s U19 team, has become the de facto kicker on the squad and a regular starter. Coming to America, she mentioned she’s definitely happy to see rugby taking off in America.
“From a British perspective, it’s great to see the sport growing over here and seeing the crowds of people,” Clements said.
Building off the momentum of her side's strong first half, Clements took possession of the ball and drew Yale’s defense in before pitching it to junior Mariah Turner and then Genevieve Quirion for a try just minutes into the second half. The trio of Clements, Weigel, and Lipson would tally seven tries before the end of the game.
After a relatively short preseason, players noted that the game was a great opportunity to let a young squad play together. At least one freshman has scored in both regular season games and a preseason game so far.
“What really stood out overall was that a lot of our tries came off of setting up our game plan and executing our game plan as we’ve practiced, so it was really exciting to see that working for us,” Schwartz said. “It gives us a lot of confidence going into harder matches where we’re really going to have to work the game plan and be challenged.”
Lipson, who only started playing rugby this fall, has acclimated to rugby quite well.
“[The kick and chase] is something that Susie and I have been working on,” Lipson said. “To actually see that, have it happen and work in a game was a pretty nice moment.”
As freshmen, Clements, Lipson, and Weigel face the difficulties of transitioning to a new environment. For all of the freshman on the squad, rugby has become more than just a game, it’s become a family.
“The team is great, it’s one of my favorite parts of being here at Harvard,” Weigel said. “We got to spend almost all of Opening Days together, we eat dinner together like every night, and it’s just a really great family and group of girls to have and have your back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In less than a second, the Harvard men’s soccer team came inches away from earning its biggest win of the season not once, but twice.
On the road against No. 9 Washington, the Crimson nearly became the first team to knock off the Huskies thanks to senior forward Michael Innocenzi’s overtime strike. But the shot bounced off the crossbar, then the goal line, denying Harvard of the potential upset.
That proved to be the closest the Crimson (1-3-2) would come to scoring over the course of its Pacific Northwest road trip, as Harvard played to a scoreless draw with Washington (4-0-2) on Sunday and dropped a 2-0 decision to Seattle (5-2-0) on Friday.
HARVARD 0, WASHINGTON 0
With Huskies’ freshman defender Luke Hauswirth backpedaling into the box to contain Innocenzi, a cut to the right was the only move the senior needed to make. With Hauswirth’s momentum carrying him in the opposite direction, Innocenzi took advantage of the open space and ripped a shot from just inside the 18-yard box.
The blast clanged off the bottom portion of the crossbar and shot down towards the goal line, landing directly on the white paint. Some members of the Crimson, Innocenzi among them, believed that the ball had crossed the line while in the air, but the referees ruled that it had remained out of the net.
With the play happening so fast, senior forward Jake Freeman acknowledged that the ruling could have gone either way, but in the moment, he thought his side has just earned a win.
“Looking at replays, the angles they give, I can’t really tell,” Freeman said. “But I was right there. I was actually running in as he shot; I was inside the 18. To me, it looked like a goal.”
In the aftermath of Harvard’s big opportunity, Washington dominated the remaining time. Over the final 16 minutes, the Huskies outshot the Crimson, 8-0, with three shots on goal.
None turned out to be more dangerous than Washington forward Josh Heard’s attempt from inside the box in the 105th minute. Heard tried to curl a shot inside the right post, but the senior’s shot was denied by a fully extended Evan Mendez, Harvard’s senior netminder, who sprawled to his left to make an acrobatic stop with his left hand.
“Evan Mendez is an unbelievable goalie,” Freeman said. “People have seen that throughout his four years here, but Sunday, he was just on a different level. From the first minute to the last minute of the game, he was the best player on the field—no question about it.”
The save was one of seven on the game for Mendez, who recorded his first shutout of the season in the draw. In the other net, Huskies’ senior goalie Ryan Herman picked up his fourth shutout of the year. Washington has surrendered just two goals through six games—both to Dartmouth, another Ivy League opponent.
Despite the Huskies’ impressive defensive track record, however, the Crimson managed to generate its share of chances throughout the contest. Washington outshot Harvard, 19-11, for the game, but during regulation, the Huskies held only an 11-10 edge. Senior forwards Oliver White and Freeman each found open space inside the box on separate occasions, but neither attacker could keep their shots on net.
“Washington did have a very good defense, but we created a lot of chances,” Freeman said. “They may have won the shot category, but we feel our chances may have been some of the better ones.”
SEATTLE 2, HARVARD 0
Prior to the draw with the Huskies, the Crimson’s weekend got out to a sluggish start on Friday. Propelled by the first two goals of freshman forward Sergio Rivas’s collegiate career, Seattle proved too much to handle, picking up a 2-0 win over Harvard.
The Redhawks outshot the Crimson, 9-3, in the first half, but Harvard held the hosts to just one shot on goal. However, the Crimson defense—still playing without co-captain Mark Ashby—eventually began to wear down, allowing Seattle to break through in the second frame.
In a span of fewer than 10 minutes, Rivas converted a tap-in and capitalized on a deflection, giving the Redhawks a commanding two-goal edge. Rivas’s first score in the 56th minute also provided rookie forward Julio Rubio with the first assist of his career.
“We were in it scoreline-wise in the first half, but in terms of play, they dominated play for the most part, and that continued through the second half,” junior co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu said. “They were just able to put away some of their chances in the second half.”

For the second weekend of the fall season, the Harvard sailing team sent contingents to three separate regattas, coming out with a fifth, a ninth, and a 10th place finish.
NEVINS TROPHY
One contingent of Crimson sailors traveled to King’s Point, New York to take on 19 other teams from all over the US. Harvard ended the weekend in fifth.
The A division went smoothly, with senior skipper Marek Zaleski sailing with both junior crews Julia Lord and Olivia Kjorlein. Over the course of eighteen races, the Crimson came out in seventh.
The squad came into some trouble in the B division, when freshman skipper Jackson Wagner arrived too late to sail in the first race. As a result, sophomore Kevin Coakley stepped in to skipper again with Kjorlein as his crew.
Wagner then stepped in at skipper for the rest of the division, with Kjorlein, Coakley, and Lord alternating at crew. In the end, the sailors ended the division in 15th.
“While everyone had good races, mistakes early in some races cost us,” Coakley said. “We will work on minimizing mental errors and staying at the top of the fleet for the rest of the season.”
Despite the issues in the B division, Harvard upped its presence in the C division, with junior Juan Perdomo taking first place—a full 39 points ahead of second place Georgetown.
The regatta was ultimately won by the Hoyas, but other teams such as the US Naval Academy, St. Mary’s College of Maryland, and Old Dominion competed as well. The pool included teams from all over the United States.
The variety of teams reflects some of the stiff competition the Crimson is likely to see in bigger regattas later this year.
“As a team, we try to get better every weekend and prepare for the fall New England championship,” Coakley said. “Every regatta this weekend had very deep fleets, so everyone who sailed matched up against top sailors.”
HATCH BROWN TROPHY
Another Harvard group stayed in Cambridge, ending the regatta hosted by MIT in a tie with Brown. While this regatta did not have teams from such a geographical range, the pool still included a number of competitive teams. The gold went to Yale, which was followed by Roger Williams and Boston College.
This regatta was sailed in fireflies in fleet-style racing, with three divisions.
The pairing of seniors skipper Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky held dowd the A division, coming in seventh. In the B division, sophomore skipper Nick Sertl and junior crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj took a tie at ninth place.
The places continued to fall in the C division, with freshman skipper Nick DiGiovanni and junior Priscilla Russo sailing to a 12th place finish.
STU NELSON
Yet another group of Harvard sailors traveled to Connecticut College to compete in FJs against a pool of 18 teams from conferences all around the US. The Crimson finished in 10th, while first went to the US Coast Guard Academy.
“We worked hard on communication and strong boat handling and are hoping to improve, and to continue working on our starts and on making strong tactical decisions throughout the races,” sophomore crew Ariana Gross said.
The A division was held down by senior skipper Sophie Bermudez and junior crew Emma Wheeler. The duo finished in 10th, tied with Fordham. In the B division, the pairing of freshman skipper Martha Gavula and Gross took 11th.
One of the greatest challenges of these early regattas has been integrating the new freshmen into the team.
“We've tried to spend a lot of time these first few weeks getting to know everyone and bonding as a team,” Gross said. “Some of the challenges that come with the opening regattas are new skipper/crew combinations learning to sail well together as well as (particularly for the younger sailors) adjusting to a higher level of competition than high school sailing.”

In the historic courtyard of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum—or, more accurately, in an hour-long wait line extending out the door and down the street—a crowd of varying ages and backgrounds congregated on Sept. 17 to enjoy good music, good drinks, and well-dressed company. Part of an ongoing modernization initiative at the Gardner and a partnership with Discover Roxbury, this particular iteration of the Gardner’s monthly Third Thursdays series created a space for artistic exploration of all sorts. Visitors milled about the moonlit garden, browsed galleries stocked with craft supplies, and soaked in live jazz music and visual art by the John Kordalewski Trio and Percy Fortini-Wright, respectively. While lingering in the new Renzo Piano-designed wing, a few attendees, whether due to the boredom of waiting in line, mild intoxication, or a mixture of both, graciously agreed to speak with this Roving Reporter. Here’s a look into the bubbly and bubbly-filled night.
Martine, student at Boston University
Roving Reporter: What brought you here tonight?
Martine: I actually used to work here, so I’ve been to Third Thursdays before. I’ve wanted to come back for a while. I love the jazz aspect of tonight’s event. And now that I’m 21, it’s way more fun.
RR: Way more legal, you mean?
Martine: Yeah, that.
Percy Fortini-Wright, graffiti artist
RR: What’s the inspiration behind your work tonight?
PFW: [Listening to] the music. I’m just vibing out myself. Spontaneity, jazz rhythms. It’s not really a deliberate painting—I’m kind of freestyling.
RR: I see many circular forms in the painting. Is that deliberate?
PFW: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Some circles, some jazz motifs—jazz is so fluid. There’s a circularity, an ovalness in jazz instruments. [That’s] what resonates sound. The notes tumble into each other; the lines move and weave, you know? 
RR: It sounds like you think of jazz as a live art, very vibrant and colorful. But your painting is in black and white. Why is that?
PFW: Jazz to me is very monochromatic. I imagine musky bars, you know, kind of darkly lit with smoky light coming through—that kind of smokiness feels truest in black and white.
RR: Has your art ever led to any interesting encounters—girls, the law?
PFW: I’ve been arrested a couple of times. It sucked, but I’ve been doing art my whole life. It feeds me, you know, and you meet beautiful people.
RR: If you weren’t doing art, what do you think you would be doing right now?
PFW: Fishing.
Danielle, learning and development coordinator at Staples
RR: Any memorable moments so far tonight?
Danielle: Not really…. [Tonight’s been] very chill, something nice to do after work. You don’t have to go home, but you don’t have to spend a lot of money and deal with crazy Boston crowds. [It’s] musical and artistic—something different to do, something relaxing. [As for something particularly memorable], maybe the drinks—
RR: Drinks are always good. Is there a particular favorite?
Danielle: Definitely the sparkling ginger. It’s amazing—I’m actually waiting in this line for a second one.
Jim & Marilyn and Angelo, local B&B owners and an Italian international student
RR: Could I get a brief introduction?
Jim: Well, we’re very important people. [laughs]. I’m retired, so I have a lot of time on my hands…. I’ve been here a couple times, so I told my sister we had to come and bring Angelo tonight. This guy just got off the plane from Italy.
RR: What do you guys think of Third Thursdays?
Jim: I love art, I love music, so I’m always happy to be here.... Also, the restaurant in the museum is awesome—we’ve met opera singers there. Tonight we met a new opera singer, and he performed while we were sitting there for dinner. It was absolutely lovely.
RR: What language was the opera in?
Angelo: Italian.
RR: Perfect. If you could use Italian to describe tonight—in just one romantic sentence—what would you say?
Angelo: It’s difficult because I’m not so romantic…
Marilyn: Just one sentence.
Angelo: Okay, okay. La gente qui è spettacolare, l’átmosfera è incredibile, è molto bello stasera qui… É grandioso!
RR: Could you translate that for us?
Angelo: It goes something like: “The people here are amazing, the atmosphere is really lovely, and it’s really beautiful tonight.”

Looking for someone to talk to about issues on campus? Seeking life advice from someone new because your academic advisor just isn’t doing the trick? Interested in spicing up your life by going to additional office hours? If any of these apply to you, we’re here to let you in on a little known secret: President Drew G Faust holds office hours.
That’s right, on a grand total of 4 separate occasions throughout the 2015-2016 school year, President Faust will be holding office hours that are accessible to students. These sessions are intended to give students the opportunity to meet with Faust in person and discuss anything Harvard-related, from Final Clubs to swai. If this is something that you may be interested in, mark your calendars for “Thursday”, October 5 from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. (note that October 5 is actually a Monday), Monday, November 16 from 3:30 p.m. to 4 p.m., Thursday, February 18 from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Monday, April 25 from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. Yes, that is a cumulative 3.5 hours over the course of the entire school year.
Note that if you are planning to go to President Faust’s office hours, simply showing up will not suffice. No, this is far more exclusive. In order to attend, you must sign-up in advance, with sign-ups beginning at 2:30 p.m that same day in Mass Hall. The one exception is that for the November 16 office half hour, sign-ups will occur the Friday before, and the appointments themselves will be held at the Longwood Medical Center. Wishing safe travels to those willing to make the 3 mile trek.
So for all of you with problems so paramount that they can be addressed by no one but the President of the University, these office hours are a must. Updates to come on what exactly will have been resolved by April after these whopping 3.5 hours of dialogue.

In case you haven’t heard, Widener Library is now open until midnight to accommodate CS50 office hours every night Monday through Friday. Desperate to spend time with stressed-out freshman experiencing the magic of coding and to know exactly what “This Is CS50” means, Flyby spent some time in the room and this is what we heard:
Official-looking woman in a teal blue shirt and a “CS50 Staff” Lanyard:
“So how do you think you get through big spaces?
“I don’t know.”
“Think about the big spaces.”
“I don’t know.”
A group of girls, all dressed in blue: 
“I finished in half an hour.”
Another group of girls, dressed in grey: 
“We spent thirteen hours on this on Saturday.”
A group of two people, both with MacBook pros, seated at a table at the far end of the room: 
“Wow, this is great!”
“This sucks! It’s cold in here.”
They fall silent as a CS50 staff member walks by. 
“There aren’t enough TFs.”
Long silence as the two expert coders turn back to their screens. Eventually, one looks up. 
“I wish David Malan didn’t say ‘This Is CS50’ so often. I sort of like, know where I am, you know?”
“I like it. It helps remind me of where I am and what I am doing with my life.”
“Yeah, that’s true.”
Both appear undisturbed by the idea that a class might serve as a reminder of identity and purpose.
Two boys huddle together over a small computer screen, covered in stickers that say “EPIC.”
“T zero. Zero. Zero. Zero. Is that even possible?”
“You’re just typing zeros. I’m not sure why you would ever want to do that?”
They look at each other, and fall silent.
A boy and a girl sit across from each other. The girl appears focused on her work, but the boy appears distressed, rubbing his eyebrows and mumbling. 
“Just sit down and someone will come over to you, they said. I’ve been here for fifty minutes. Where is my help? Hello? Can someone help me? This is right, why isn’t it working? They told me this is right. What am I doing? Hello?”
A boy and a girl are laughing loudly at a table. Curious, I walk over.
“I just realized I was missing C-type H! And I didn’t need string.h!”
“Yeah, Dean and I just spent twenty minutes just figuring it out. Haha!”
I don’t know what is so funny about this. I leave.
At this point, a CS50 staff member walks up to me and quietly requests that I sit down and wait for someone to help me with my code, or to leave. Another TF walks up. I am asked to leave when I explain my journalist intent. So long, CS50!
