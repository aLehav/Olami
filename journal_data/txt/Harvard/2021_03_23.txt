Harvard plans to reopen its campus to all faculty, staff, and researchers on Aug. 2 in light of expected Covid-19 vaccine availability, the University announced Monday.
In the announcement, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp wrote that Harvard hopes to return “as many students as possible” in the fall, though they provided no specifics on the plans of individual schools.
Most Harvard faculty and staff have been working remotely due to the pandemic since last March when the coronavirus shut down campus. Lapp previously told faculty and staff they would work from home until at least the end of June.
Bacow, Garber, and Lapp wrote that certain activities may require earlier return dates throughout the summer and fall. Each school and unit will “take the lead” in planning the return of remote employees in line with departmental priorities.
“It is important to emphasize that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to this transition period,” they wrote.
The announcement also states Harvard plans to update its human resources policies to ensure the University is “in step with the realities and opportunities of the post-pandemic work environment.”
Harvard will also expand its Covid-19 testing program to include employees who have not previously been working on campus, per the announcement. Harvard has been gradually increasing the number of faculty and staff members it tests throughout the academic year.
Currently, the University conducts around 20,000 total tests per week, including roughly 8,500 tests for faculty, staff, and other affiliates. There have been 198 positives among the category faculty, staff and other affiliates since the start of 2021, according to Harvard’s testing dashboard.
University and school leaders will also work to expand the current Harvard University Guidance for On-Campus Activity policies to ensure sufficient support services and safety protocols are in place upon the return of remote employees, the administrators wrote.
The announcement did not indicate if employees hired from outside contractors would be included in the Aug. 2 return to campus.

Did Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak save 2021? Quite possibly, yes! Not only have they released a gem of a new single — “Leave the Door Open” — but they’ve also formed their own band, Silk Sonic. They’ve even announced the imminent release of a new album which, if “Leave the Door Open” is any indication, will most likely be full of sensational bops.
The music video for “Leave the Door Open” is a care-free blast from the past. Set in an old recording studio bathed in warm light with a drum set, an electric keyboard and a few stools, it’s a full four minutes of Silk Sonic vibing to their own ‘70s-style song while girls in the booth record them and dance along. With phenomenal background vocals and tasteful instrumentation, this R&B song highlights the soaring voices of Mars and .Paak. It’s a no-frills departure from the more edited and complex multi-set music videos common in 2021. Working only with camera angles and their musical instruments, the band tells a simple love story that melts away with an end-of-video fadeout.
The band’s unbridled happiness is infectious: wearing sunglasses and vintage printed shirts, everyone grins and plays off each other’s energy. Sometimes Mars and .Paak even sing straight to the camera, letting you know they’re in on the joke. You feel like you're being serenaded, ‘70s style, by the entire band — there’s even disco ball lighting. How can you be down about anything when you hear .Paak sing “I’m sippin wine” and everyone in the band responds “sip sip?”
The single premiered on Mar. 5, and Mars and .Paak performed it at the 63rd Grammy Awards on Mar. 14 with a similar retro flare, including matching monochrome burgundy suits with bootcut pants and backup singers dancing in a triangle.
A comment posted on the “Leave the Door Open” Youtube music video hit the nail on the head, saying: “The people who disliked this song should get a covid test done, because one of the symptoms is no taste.”

Like most other Doja Cat music videos, “Streets” is bizarre and infused with many sexual themes.
The music video begins with a traffic-jammed New York City streetway; Doja Cat poses as a mannequin in a store window. A taxi driver takes notice of her, and she begins to seduce him as the music and vibe of the whole video dramatically shift to become almost hallucinogenic. This otherworldly realm mirrors that of The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” –– which also embodies a carnal and vacant mental state. The taxi driver, who is sucked into this alternate reality, is mesmerized by Doja Cat’s sensuality. She suddenly appears wearing a sexier outfit, dancing erotically for the taxi driver. Likewise, the music video begins to resemble a more explicitly sexual music video, similar to other Doja Cat videos like “Say So” and “Juicy.” Nonetheless, although the message she promotes is very sensual, the video is not unreasonably so, as other rap videos like “WAP” from Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion are just as sensual if not more.
Throughout the music video, red comes to symbolize sexual desire, particularly that of men, while also appearing to mark a shift from the normal perception of reality towards a very objectified and materialistic one. Doja Cat seems enabled by this shift, empowering herself through her sexual charms. Nonetheless, her message is not overly obsessive or controlling. It remains light-weight and simple to decipher: Doja Cat sees her lover as “a one in a million” and wants to keep him to herself.
The music video progresses with another scene change as Doja Cat starts to transform into a spider. Doja Cat first appears in a ripped, black dress, performing atop a demolished car for men with glazed over eyes and diamond grillz in their teeth. As the taxi driver from before gets too close to her, she traps him in her web. The lyrics appropriately portray this scene, as she sings, “Tryna keep him 'cause I found him / Let a hoe know, I ain't motherfuckin' sharing.” Though the aim seems to be empowerment, the underlying messages seem to be that Doja’s sexuality is the only way she can “keep” her man. This limits her feminine empowerment to a very superficial sense of control.
In another moment of symbolism, the appearance of mannequins at two points in the video –– both Doja Cat at the beginning of the music video and her lover beside her on a couch at the end –– represents a materialistic and empty sense of “love” and intimacy. In this later scene, Doja Cat lays on the lap of a mannequin model of her lover, oblivious to the world around her even as it erupts in flames. In this sense, Doja Cat has an innocent aura –– she is blind to what a deeper love is like, clinging to a man she can only have physically.
“Streets” reflects this “child-like” attitude in many senses, as it shows Doja Cat’s inexperience with a more profound love. Nonetheless, the music itself is slow-wave, complimenting Doja Cat’s voice well. “Streets” does not diverge very far from her typical music style, but it is not as upbeat as other songs like “Like That” and “Boss Bitch.” Nevertheless, the message resembles Doja Cat’s simple and upbeat personality, encouraging a good time as it is sometimes needed.

In a world where streaming services like Spotify make most commercial recordings available for quasi-ownership at under $10/month, new classical recordings in particular struggle for relevance. In many cases, critically acclaimed commercial recordings already feature the same pieces. How does an orchestra convince listeners that their version is worth listening to?
Under conductor Marcus Bosch, The North German Philharmonic Rostock’s latest release provides a refreshing take on the classical album. The album of works by Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, and Prokofiev sidesteps the question of relevance by curating pieces linked by a very specific theme, not one of abstractness like love or death, but instead one of materiality: playing cards. The repertoire mirrors the structure of a performance, beginning with the overture from Tchaikovsky’s opera “Pique Dame,” followed by Stravinsky’s ballet music “Jeu de cartes,” and finally, Prokofiev’s more substantial “Four Portraits and Denouement,” an orchestral suite of music taken from his first mature opera “The Gambler.” Bizarre as the album may look next to its solemn classical counterparts, it is a much-needed break from the monotony of classical recording themes.
Works on classical recordings usually share a composer, country of origin, or featured soloist. Representative examples from the past month include the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s Grammy-winning set of complete Ives symphonies, Paul Lewis and Steven Osborne’s collection of French piano duets, and baritone Ludovic Tézier’s recordings of fourteen Verdi arias with the Opera Orchestra of Bologna.
A theme as narrow as playing cards has an obvious drawback: Few pieces fit it. Rostock reaches into the dusty corners of all three composer’s oeuvres to find the trio of works on the album. When “Pique Dame” is mentioned, most think of the operetta of the same name by von Suppé before the Tchaikovsky opera, and likewise, “Four Portraits and Denouement” is a mostly unknown work by the otherwise famous composer Prokofiev. “Jeu de cartes” is perhaps the least obscure of the three, but still does not rank among Stravinsky’s well-established pieces.
The issue of repertoire choice aside, Rostock successfully presents an unconventional listening experience, challenging listeners to try to “hear” the cards in all three pieces.
Tchaikovsky’s “Pique Dame,” or “Queen of Spades,” is based on Pushkin’s short story of the same name. The overture is slight, coming in at just over three minutes, and struggles to establish a solid structure. Tchaikovsky establishes three successive themes and abandons them just as quickly. The beginning contains recycled material from his Fifth Symphony, completed just one year before “Pique Dame,” and after a brief storm — the likes of which we see in his earlier work “The Tempest — the piece abruptly ends.
The material is typical of Tchaikovsky in all aspects, if condensed. The Rostock recording shows off the particularly dramatic dynamic swells that define the piece, which at one point traverses a dynamic range of “pppp” to “ffff” in just 16 measures. The three minutes cross an impressive emotional spectrum as well — from strong feelings of loneliness to agitation to romance — and Rostock represents the sudden changes in mood well. The climax is an impressive show of orchestral might, and Rostock ensures the various quotations are true to their respective origins.
Next, Stravinsky’s “Jeu de cartes,” or “Game of Cards,” is a short ballet in three “deals” featuring an evil joker, whose eventual defeat represents ordinary people’s occasional triumph over the elite. The piece exhibits Stravinsky’s typical neoclassical style, with a particular emphasis on humor and irony. Rostock achieves chamber music-like sensitivity in every place that calls for it, while also experiencing moments of collective frailty in some of Stravinsky’s more forceful passages. The orchestra lets Stravinsky’s sense of humor shine through without descending into the slapstick. The joker’s character successfully comes through in the music, and while achieving a clownish sound is by no means as easy as it sounds, Rostock’s horn section seems up to the challenge of trying to make a stony-faced classical audience laugh.
Finally, Prokofiev’s “The Gambler” is another opera based on a Russian story, this time one by Dostoevsky. The opera describes a thick web of debtors and creditors, with the roulette wheel as an avenue for both debt forgiveness and further destitution. Prokofiev cut and pasted material from “The Gambler” to create the orchestral suite “Four Portraits and Denouement,” which sketches Dostoevsky’s characters Alexei, Granny, the General, and Paulina. Though he produced the suite later in his life, the music from the opera is solidly early Prokofiev. The busy orchestration includes two harps and piano playing almost continuously, creating a dense, middle-heavy color palette. Rostock succeeds in cleaning up some of the noise to ensure the important voices stand out. “Paulina” is particularly clear in this regard, while the complexities of a spry, slick, and avaricious elderly character come across especially effectively in “Granny.” Rostock flexes its first and third trumpet players through frequent features in Prokofiev’s demanding solos.
The Denouement is an episode of Alexei’s winning streak at the roulette wheel, in which the orchestra approximates the spinning, bouncing ball. This is one place that calls for unreserved, noisy playing, and Rostock’s woodwind players approach this movement with needed energy. The ensuing brass chorale-like melody under the roulette ball ostinato is the apex of the movement’s forceful chaos. The piece ends with a rumble of orchestral thunder, which Rostock faithfully replicates.
The short album — just fifty minutes — is a perfect Saturday listen. It is by no means a giant of the classical repertory, nor does it attempt to be one. In curating a hyper-specific theme, Rostock sets up a half-lighthearted, half-serious mood throughout that very nicely illustrates the two sides of card games and gambling: winning and losing. While the album is by no means light music for poker night, it is worth revisiting after all bets are settled.

This review contains spoilers for Season One of "Murder Among the Mormons."
A brilliant forger, a charming man, and a Mormon: Mark Hofmann is no Joe Exotic, but his exploits make for a story rivalling “Tiger King,” one that turns a docuseries into a suspenseful thriller. Netflix’s three-episode “Murder Among the Mormons,” which premiered March 3, won’t let audiences look away from the screen, offering a fascinating glimpse into the actions of a fraudster that electrified public conversation in the state of Utah and the Mormon Church.
The story begins innocently enough, describing how, as a boy, Hofmann once played treasure-hunting with his friends and dug up a jar of old coins in a forest. He was the only one lucky enough to find anything, for a good reason. The previous evening he had gone to the forest alone and buried the “treasure” to “discover” it the next day in the presence of his friends. They were awed — and that was the goal. “As far back as I can remember, I have liked to impress people through my deceptions. Fooling people gave me a sense of power and superiority,” Hofmann says in the series. He was 14 when he first successfully counterfeited a coin. He aged it so well using a method he developed himself that he deceived the Department of Treasury and had the coin pronounced genuine. During his career, he forged everything from early-Mormon history documents to George Washington’s letters to Emily Dickinson’s poems. “It’s not so much what is genuine and what isn’t, as what people believe is genuine,” he explains.
On the surface, it sounds like another incredible story of a clever con man who got away, which Hollywood would gladly take and turn into a box office hit in the vein of “Catch Me If You Can.” But Mark Hofmann murdered two people to keep his deceptions from being exposed, and along the way attacked the foundations of the Mormon faith.
The complexity of the story is undeniable, but “Murder Among the Mormons” did it justice, turning a challenge into the documentary’s greatest strength. One of Hofmann’s closest associates, Shannon Flynn, noted, “It’s easy for people to nowadays say, ‘Well, couldn’t you see that? What’s the matter with you?’ Well, you know, hindsight’s always 20/20.” The series’ producers seem to have taken the words to heart, realizing that letting audiences in on Hofmann’s illegal enterprises from the beginning would waste the premise’s potential and shock value. Instead, Hofmann is introduced as an Indiana Jones of document dealers, whose bookstore discoveries upset Mormon leaders. The audience, oblivious to his culpability, is led to believe that the victims of the bombings were a target of some elaborate Latter-day Saints church conspiracy — that he himself was being framed for sharing the inconvenient truth, and, as some suggest, “this was retaliatory.” It’s only halfway through the series that the audience gets a hint something is wrong. By showing events in the order they happened, presenting only the information that at a given time would have been available to law enforcement and the public, Netflix doesn’t just avoid a pitfall. Thanks to it, the great reveal that comes at the end of the second episode surprises as much as it must have back in 1985.
The framing of the story isn’t the only area in which “Murder Among the Mormons” shines. The soundtrack is as revealing as the script, almost perfectly complementing the on-screen events especially toward the end of the second and third episode, and making the gravity of the situation feel palpable. It proves neither overused nor overwhelming, hitting the sweet spot in which it allows the subjects of its interviews to take the spotlight while seamlessly reinforcing their message imprinting their feelings on the audience. That sense of seamlessness is the documentary’s defining feature. Be it the vivid reenactments, poignant excerpts from interviews, or contemporary photographs, everything seems to play a role, each piece lending itself to a greater whole, a whole that resonates on a level one wouldn’t expect from a documentary. It might not have fireworks, but it leaves the audience shaken.
It’s not all sunshine and roses for “Murder Among the Mormons,” though. The docuseries is simply too ambitious, trying to address more than it could possibly handle in its relatively short runtime. The mystery followed throughout the series occasionally proves too much. Even to a viewer familiar with the subject, navigating the series’ many subplots can turn out to be a challenge. Between the history, and the doctrine of the Mormon church, Hofmann’s enterprises, and methods, the bombings, the plot twists, and the cleverly-cut interviews meant to keep the audience in the dark, the documentary suffers form a fundamental problem. It touches on a lot, but explores little in depth, leaving its viewers to wonder if they really know what’s going on.
It is difficult to make a documentary about a murderer if the interviewees admire him — not as a killer, of course, but as a professional. One of the last scenes of “Murder Among the Mormons” is telling: Shannon Flynn, dressed in an old-fashioned suit and a bow-tie, asks not to be questioned whether Hofmann was good at what he did. "Don’t make me answer that,” he says. After a moment, he adds, resigned, “he was fantastic.” Despite the challenges of production, and the measly three hours into which the story was crammed, the series manages to be just like Hofmann’s colleague described him. Fantastic.

TW/CW: The following piece contains references to sexual assault.
This review contains spoilers. 
When Focus Features released the trailer for “Promising Young Woman,” writer-director Emerald Fennell’s feature directorial debut, the film’s premise seemed… well, promising. In a chilling, saccharine sequence, the trailer introduced Cassie (Carey Mulligan): a med-school dropout on a mission to avenge her friend Nina’s rape and instill fear in the hearts of would-be sexual predators everywhere. From this preview, the movie seemed to have all the elements of a modern feminist classic. A militant take on dismantling rape culture? Check. A determined, nuanced female protagonist? Yup. A scalding denunciation of the self-proclaimed “nice guys” who take advantage of women when nobody’s looking? Definitely.
Yet when the full film was finally released, “Promising Young Woman” failed to deliver on all counts — offering only a reductive and tonally incoherent narrative with a harmful message around violence, survival and justice.
“Promising Young Woman” initially draws in viewers by presenting a compelling, refreshingly ruthless protagonist in Cassie. Her crusade against sexual violence opens with a ruse we learn she’s repeated many times: She acts fall-down drunk in a bar so that supposedly well-meaning men will take her home, then turns on them when they try to assault her. With ominous shots of Cassie returning home the next day and adding a tally to a notebook full of them, Cassie is implied to be some kind of feminist “Dexter,” exacting bloody vigilante justice. This, on its own, is a positive step away from the “rape revenge” genre popular in the 1970s, which generally began with gratuitous depictions of rape. “Promising Young Woman” resists this tendency to subject viewers to unnecessary, exploitative depictions of sexual violence that set up a later rampage, and instead skips straight to Cassie’s revenge mission.
Unfortunately, though, the feminist innovation essentially ends there. By framing Cassie as a bloodthirsty avenger yet inverting the tropes of the rape-revenge genre, the film could have still had a substantive message. Instead, Cassie’s character — originally presented as cunning, focused, and touchingly loyal to Nina — is continually undermined by the film’s narrative progression, becoming increasingly inconsistent and one-dimensional.
First, while the film initially implies that Cassie exacts violent revenge on the predators from bars who take her home, successive scenes reveal she really just warns them to stop and then goes on her way. This could be viewed as a criticism of the eye-for-an-eye ethos of rape-revenge stories, which often deprive their heroines of the chance to substantively process trauma and push them towards blunt violence. Yet Cassie is never seen explicitly processing her trauma; she just ghosts through her parents’ McMansion and wanders around town. The film becomes a portrait of a woman whose life has been stunted by trauma without actually unpacking or developing her interiority.
Furthermore, the movie doesn’t actually portray Cassie’s non-violent tactics as effective: After Cassie goes home with Jerry (Adam Brody) and does her routine, a later encounter with his friend reveals that Jerry told other men about it and, rather than reflecting on his predatory behavior, depicted Cassie as crazy.
Even as it tries to portray Cassie as a woman on the edge of a breakdown, the film never strays from an image of camera-ready perfection. Whether she’s wandering her house or stalking her targets, she’s always fully made-up, put-together, and styled to the max, a costumed character in a glossy fantasy rather than a living, breathing person whose inner life is increasingly chaotic. The unrelenting perfection adds to the film’s tonal disconnect — it cobbles together light moments in bright setpieces, long gaps of suffocating stillness, and dreamlike sequences of Cassie drifting through fields to confusing effect, making it nearly impossible to keep track of her goals. At a moment when Cassie has supposedly reached her psychological breaking point, she dresses up as a sexy nurse — as if we are to believe that she has completely snapped under the weight of the patriarchy but still had a perfect male-gaze-maximizing costume ready. The film’s cinematography, costuming, and makeup, while polished, thus add to the dissonance of the film.
After all this, though, it is the last act of the film that really destroys its credibility as a feminist pièce de résistance. Cassie finally decides to exact violent revenge on Nina’s attackers, diverting back to the convention of the rape-revenge genre. But the movie never reaches the classic fever-pitch rampage sequence — instead, the ending is anticlimactic, underwhelming, and doesn’t begin to do justice to the cause the film is centered around.
Ultimately, Cassie and her targets face drastically different consequences — but audiences are still supposed to be satisfied that justice is served because (some of) Nina’s attackers get arrested. This supposedly-triumphant ending relies on a starkly unrealistic view of the U.S. justice system. In truth, the rapists’ arrest is only the beginning of a long and complex legal process that has been shown time and time again to favor perpetrators and minimize the impact of their actions. According to RAINN, for the estimated 13% of rapes that are reported to police and referred to prosecutors, only 7% lead to a felony conviction (meaning nearly half of defendants are acquitted.) Yet viewers are still supposed to trust that the perpetrators will be held accountable because the movie ends with them in cuffs.
This glorification of the criminal justice system ties in with another glaring problem in “Promising Young Woman.” Almost everyone in the movie, including Nina’s rapists, is white — with the exception of Laverne Cox, whose talent is woefully underutilized as she’s relegated to a stereotypical sidekick role. Yet the film never grapples with their privilege or how it enables their actions. It’s structural racism, as well as patriarchy, that insulates Nina’s rapists from consequences, both legal and social.
Ultimately, “Promising Young Woman” leaves viewers wondering what it’s trying to say. Superficially, nobody wins — but, really, some do. Pitted against rape culture, the women involved literally die; the men go on living. When asked why Cassie couldn’t survive, Fennell told Vulture, “I just didn’t understand how that would happen without it being…. incredibly depressing… What happens after you’ve done that stuff? Your life’s still ruined.” This is the core problem with “Promising Young Woman:” it sets up violence as the only true catharsis, portraying all other measures as insufficient, and then concludes that, since Cassie used violence, she must die. The only catharsis is martyrdom.
During a time when the #MeToo movement and widespread cultural shifts have opened spaces for survivors to speak, hold perpetrators accountable, and process trauma, this film allows Cassie (and the absent Nina) to do none of the above. Despite Mulligan’s solid performance, she has little to work with given a script that fails to invert genre tropes or give depth to its protagonist. “Promising Young Woman” offers little by way of social commentary; instead, it reveals only that nuanced, women-led stories about trauma and recovery (stories like Michaela Coel’s moving “I May Destroy You”) are still far too rare in Hollywood.

If kids had it their way, parents would never say “no” — they would eat ice cream for breakfast, and would always be allowed to party with friends. “Yes Day” explores what happens when preteens acquire every wish their heart desires: For 24 hours, parents Allison and Carlos Torres (Jennifer Garner and Édgar Ramírez) must say “yes” to all of their three children’s requests. Even as the film tries to mix up the goofy, good-natured family comedy movie genre with a unique premise and a Hispanic household,“Yes Day” is ultimately unimpactful. The movie prioritizes breadth over depth, relying on the allure of its premise to breathe life into otherwise flat characters.
After parenthood has forced Allison and Carlos to renounce fun and enforce house rules, they finally agree to a “yes day” in hopes it’ll be an outlet for their childrens’ frustrations. Their kids are, of course, ecstatic: Ellie (Everly Carganilla) wants to jump on the bed, Nando (Julian Lerner) wants to cover the house in pink foam, and Katie (Jenna Ortega) wants to go to a music festival with her friends — without her mom by her side.
What follows is the promise of relatives struggling to realize the value of family over the course of their single intriguing “yes day,” but the movie's reality doesn’t live up to its own potential. The Torres’s are still populated with typical American movie tropes, from the soccer mom to the sulky teenager, and while “Yes Day” tries to subvert these tropes with each character’s arc into maturity, it just comes across as forced. Take Allison fighting a fellow carnival-game-player for a stuffed pink gorilla. In this scene, the mom smiles a little too sarcastically. As a result, the Torres’ family gradual learning curve isn’t gratifying; instead, the characters in “Yes Day” feel predictable and all-too-familiar.
Still, “Yes Day” tries to offer a fresh perspective by portraying a Hispanic household rather than the white families characteristic of most Hollywood family comedy movies. But because the filmmakers don’t nuance the main characters, ethnicity only ever feels like a surface-level element to the film. Carlos, who is Hispanic, has a thick accent and occasionally bursts into Spanish when demanding a clean house or reprimanding Katie for being mean to her mother. But even in the Torres family, Spanish does little to enhance the characters’ relationships to each other. In reality, the spontaneous switching to Spanish in their interactions is distracting, unrealistic, and cringy. Allison guilting Carlos into continuing their “yes day” with poorly-pronounced amateur Spanish is supposed to be touching, but only serves as a reminder that the Torres family is, indeed, Hispanic.
Where the film shines is with director Miguel Artata, who draws on his previous experience with family comedy movies to make “Yes Day” a lighthearted and well-paced 89 minutes. From the beginning of the movie, which opens with young Allison cannonballing into a river, the visuals help replicate the feel of childhood. Subtly saturated and rosy, the film is filled with summer colors that invoke nostalgia for hot and lethargic days. The frequent use of montage — from ice-cream eating to water balloon fighting to screaming in the car wash — mimics the blur of a fun summer day. Even the music helps keep the momentum of cheeriness: The Gummy Bear Song and “The Best Day of My Life” pop up on the radio, and even H.E.R. makes an appearance at the music festival. The effort to make “Yes Day” a movie that can be sung along to is certainly successful.
“Yes Day” is an easy-to-digest film. It’s not meant to reset American culture or revolutionize the family comedy genre, but it is an okay movie to put on after family dinner. It’s a movie that doesn’t ask for much focus to follow the plot, populated with typical characters who struggle to appreciate the family around them. “Yes Day” is ultimately a cute concept that culminates in lukewarm entertainment, even as the film fails to offer dynamic, surprising, and interesting characters in the Torres Family.

With an array of artfully shot scenes, “The Little Things” brings back the feel of a classic crime thriller. In the same vein as “Se7en,” this film takes its time to develop while leading the viewer through a familiar, yet completely satisfying journey. With riveting twists and turns, the film is a carefully crafted masterpiece. Following Detective Joe “Deke” Deacon (Denzel Washington) as he gets roped into a string of mysterious murders alongside the up-and-coming Detective Jim Baxter (Rami Malek), “The Little Things” unearths fractured pasts and illuminates the dark, twisted motivation behind a string of horrible murders targeting young girls.
With stars like Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto, it's difficult to end up with a boring film. The three actors build off of each other’s performances with incredible ease. Even simple gestures, like the wave of a hand from Leto’s character Albert Sparma as he’s interviewed by the police, is a powerful display of talent.
Despite limited screentime, Leto’s disturbingly playful attitude contributes to a jaw-dropping performance. It’s astounding the way that Leto demands attention throughout the film. The sheer horrifying intensity in his eyes when audiences first see him injects a violent sense of unease. It’s these simple actions — these little things — throughout the movie that make his performance terrifying yet absolutely astounding. It’s unsurprising, but always impressive, that an acclaimed method actor is able to dive that deep into the mind of a sick, twisted man.
In another noteworthy performance, Rami Malek, playing Jim Baxter, exudes the steady confidence of a young, up and coming detective who is willing to do whatever it takes to make amends for these brutally murdered girls. Scene to scene as the film progresses, the discomfort he feels becomes increasingly visible as he pursues Sparma and glimpses the horror encapsulated in this one man’s life. That is until he finally sees the twisted, machiavellian display of apathy towards another man laid out clear. At this point, his face becomes absolutely emotionless — void, pure apathy. He can’t pursue this monster within the confines of the law.
And finally, Denzel Washington. As the main character, Joe “Deke” Deacon has a personality that can’t quite be pinned down. He’s a man truly caught in the intersection of complete apathy and a deeply-rooted desire to amend his past wrongs. Regardless, it seems an unfortunate mistake of his past has completely darkened his soul. In his scenes, he’s consistently a silhouette basked in eerie shadow.
image id=1349355 align=center size=large caption=true
It is the combination of these three phenomenal actors and their beautifully written characters that make this movie shine; it's the stark contrasts between these central characters that brings vitality to the film.
Unsurprisingly, with John Lee Hancock behind the camera and at the writing table, “The Little Things” was destined to be great. With a well-accoladed and successful career, which includes films like “The Blind Side” and “Saving Mr. Banks," the director effortlessly turned towards the dark side. The entirety of “The Little Things” runs as a well-organized exercise in chaos.
“The Little Things” echoes the successes of “Se7en” in one final way: the mystery only grows as the movie reaches its climax. Just as the man cleanses the city of its sins in “Se7en” and never reveals his final secret, so too do the mysteries of “The Little Things” die with the closing shots of the film, never to be solved. This nod to another great film shows just how wonderful this newest crime thriller truly is. By creating genuine characters and paying close attention to every detail — the lighting in the background of every scene, the careful dialogue of the supporting actors — Hancock entrances the audience and takes them on a wild ride.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Asian American experience has long been characterized by invisibility. Activists have attempted to raise awareness of anti-Asian violence for decades, to no avail, but the past few weeks have focused the nation’s attention on the growing prevalence of hate crimes against Asian Americans. Yet the public reaction to anti-Asian racism illustrates an issue at the heart of what it means to be Asian American: Asian Americans are incredibly diverse, but other people implicitly group us together as a homogenous category in their messages of support.
A few phrases seem to seep into every statement made. For instance, a message from Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, titled “Standing Against Anti-Asian Racism,” stated, “We stand in solidarity with the members of the AAPI community here at Harvard and across the nation.” I truly appreciate this message’s sentiment, and there is nothing uniquely frustrating about this memo alone. However, I have read that people are standing “with the members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community” in many places without ever understanding what the phrase means. There is a constant, ongoing debate over whether one cohesive AAPI community exists. Though there have been numerous attempts to define AAPI identity, no clear consensus has emerged. There are few clear similarities between my experiences and those of the victims in the recent Atlanta shootings, or between my experiences and those of most other members of the so-called “AAPI community” at all for that matter.
I am part of the “AAPI community” to the extent that when other people look at those victims, they see some resemblance to me. But if I am honest, I do not feel much of a connection to these names in the news, and I am not sure that perceived physical similarities necessarily constitute a distinct and definable shared identity. Well-intentioned emails like Dean Gay’s are most impactful in how they remind me of the strangeness of being Asian American — of being perceived as one piece of a larger community that may or may not exist.
Besides the cultural differences between different Asian countries, there are also differences between those who immigrated at different times. There is no one Asian American experience. Indeed, activists invented the term “Asian American” in the 1960s to unite disparate ethnic groups into a more powerful political force. I would never presume to speak for all Asian Americans; I don’t think it’s possible to speak for such a diverse set of people.
This is why I take issue with much of the generously distributed advice and shows of sympathy concerning anti-Asian hate crimes. Some of my friends appreciate awareness-raising posts on social media and think that it would have been inappropriate if, for example, Harvard had not firmly denounced hate crimes against Asian Americans. I know that many non-Asians feel that they are in an impossible position, where not posting on social media could be construed as ignorance or indifference but making a statement could be seen as performative.
However, just as there is no singular definition of “AAPI community,” there is no one correct answer that will allow anyone to rid themselves of the stain of American racism. It is easy to say that Harvard stands “in solidarity with the members of the AAPI community,” but it is much harder to determine what that entails. It is easy to follow the advice of impersonal articles or posts about how people should reach out to Asian friends, but it is much harder to acknowledge that while some will appreciate the gesture, not all Asian Americans deal with tragedy in the same way.
Ultimately, I am tired of being seen only as a hollow representative of a larger racial group and being used as such in the reactions to these hate crimes. My main source of unity with other Asian Americans is that I am instantly recognizable as an outsider who will never quite belong in white America. This otherness, perceptible in a millisecond, leaves Asians vulnerable to acts of racism. After all, prejudice comes out of ignorance and a tendency to flatten real people into stereotypes without nuance.
Oftentimes there is no hate behind these actions. When people presume my last name is “Kim” or “Wang” based on my appearance, they don’t mean any harm. I am also sure no one means to offend when they implicitly treat Asian Americans as one uniform coalition in the wake of these attacks. However, the desire for simplicity and neat categorization which motivates both of these phenomena can contribute to the same cycle of ignorance. Both are reminders of my otherness and of the fact that in many ways my Asian identity is defined in opposition to whiteness; so long as I do not fit in, I am presumed to be like all of the others who don’t fit in either.
I would like to believe that some formula to end racism exists and that we could prevent all of these hateful acts if only we could all say the right things. Unfortunately, nothing about the current rise in crimes against Asian Americans is simple. There is no one correct way to react and implying that one exists reveals a deep misunderstanding of the problem. Addressing the “AAPI community” might make for a more concise social media post, but I hope that raising awareness for Asian Americans does not come at the expense of recognizing us, first and foremost, as people.

With or without a metronome, I can’t help but measure time in music.
My next piano lesson is in five days. A year has passed since my last orchestra rehearsal. And the “Brandenburg Concertos” are almost 15 times as old as I am.
At least, March 24 marks 300 years since J. S. Bach dedicated the six pieces to the Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, hence their nickname. I don’t know when he actually wrote them. What I do remember is playing the third movement of “Brandenburg Concerto no. 3” in G major one December night in 2019, at my first concert with Harvard’s Mozart Society Orchestra. I didn’t realize it would be my last.
In my mind, with its strange system of sensory associations, G major radiates the warm glow of the blocks of rosin peeking out of violin cases at rehearsal. It perfectly matches the floors of the music rooms under Paine Hall, where I once signed up to practice every morning. It’s the brilliant orange of the last sunset I watched from Weeks Bridge before leaving Harvard’s campus just over a year ago.
I’ve always been better at measuring time in music than playing music in time. When I got my assigned part for “Brandenburg Concerto no. 3,” I didn’t know what to do with the three short pages in compound meter except play them as fast as possible. I didn’t even have the patience to count the beats before I was supposed to start. But our rehearsals finally taught me to listen for my cues. We practiced every Tuesday night until we could end every performance together on the same triumphant, bright orange chord.
During that December concert, that G-major warmth helped me forget the icy wind that had almost numbed my hands on the way there (despite my two pairs of insulated gloves) and the stubborn heaps of snow refusing to melt just outside. The movement unfolded so quickly, in a relentless whirl of 16th notes, that it left no time to think about anything else. Its longest pause lasts a scant half measure, filled entirely by residual sound.
To listen to the “Brandenburg Concertos” is to enter a state of perpetual motion, which I welcomed as I started college. As beloved fixtures in my freshman fall study playlist, the pieces echoed the busy excitement of a typical school day, their contrapuntal themes overlapping like Google Calendar events. The bouncy major-key melodies promised something great ahead.
I was warming up on the grand piano in my favorite orange-floored practice room — where else would I have been? — when I got the email giving us just five more days on campus last March. As I frantically packed that night, the “Brandenburg Concertos” no longer provided joyful accompaniment; instead, they induced something closer to motion sickness. I’d only just learned the new repertoire for my spring orchestra concert, whose date still hovered in my calendar beside the weekly rehearsals repeating forever in my phone. Would they really end so soon?
Over those next five days, I said goodbye to the places that music had affixed in my memory. I didn’t stay long at Paine Hall. The silence bothered me too much. I felt as if the disappearance of the sounds I’d grown so used to hearing every day had stopped time itself.
The night I arrived home to finish the spring semester online, I ran through a piece I’d prepared for a rehearsal that never happened. The piano part sounded awful by itself — jagged and dry without the strings’ lyrical support. I’m sure my rushed playing wasn’t helping either, but counting the beats would have meant accepting the missing melodies, note by note. I couldn’t do that. Besides, no one was there to tell me to slow down.
No one was sitting next to me to turn my pages, or across the room to cue me in. No one would split a syrup-drenched “Veritaffle” with me after rehearsal anymore. We wouldn’t even have rehearsals in the first place, let alone make music together again, for a very long time.
Of course, I was wrong. I found “Brandenburg Concerto no. 3” in a stack of sheet music from my old dorm a few months ago. As in many of his keyboard scores, Bach hadn’t written any dynamic markings — fading penciled-in symbols showed where the Mozart Society Orchestra had added our own. Above Bach’s designation of “Allegro” (indicating speed, but literally meaning “cheerful”), I saw a note to keep the tempo and silently scolded myself for having ever wanted to rush through happiness.
Revisiting the piece helped me remember that even as the days seem to melt together, they’re marching on with the tenacity of Bach’s fastest third movement. And the “Brandenburg Concertos” weren’t the only reminder. My best friends from orchestra and I talk every week. Along with echoes of memories from campus, I hear a more hopeful tune in the Zoom computer audio that lets us share our favorite songs from hundreds of miles apart and in the fanfare that announces our online gaming victories — which, we sometimes joke, build teamwork almost as well as rehearsal. I like to think our video editing skills are improving with each virtual performance we put together. I guess time didn’t stop with the music after all. Maybe the music never stopped.

Cambridge will remain in Phase Three of its reopening plan despite the state’s decision to move forward to Phase Four on March 22, Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob announced Monday.
Although Cambridge’s testing positivity rate was 0.45 percent as of March 13, virus variants and vaccine shortages will continue to inform reopening plans in the city, according to City Manager Louis A. DePasquale.
“As with each previous decision made, I will continue to work closely with my team and our public health professionals, and the state and our regional partners,” DePasquale said at a City Council meeting on Monday. “As we have said many times, the safety of our residents will always be this office’s top priority.”
This week, Cambridge progressed further into Phase Two of its Covid-19 vaccination program, widening eligibility to include individuals aged 60 and older and some essential workers, including those in the sanitation, grocery, utility, and transit sectors.
As of March 19, the city has administered 2,480 doses of either the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccine to eligible Cambridge residents.
On March 16, the state approved a proposal issued by the Cambridge Health Alliance in partnership with nine other cities, including Everett and Somerville, to establish local mass vaccination sites in Somerville and at the Gantcher Center at Tufts University.
However, Jacob said the partnership has yet to get off the ground due to the continuing statewide vaccine supply shortage.
“At this time, no start dates have been set — the launch of the Metro North vaccination site is contingent on more vaccine supply becoming available,” Jacob said. “The city will actively promote the regional sites once we have the go-ahead from the state to do so.”
On April 5, the city will enter the last stage of Phase Two of the vaccination timeline and expand eligibility to include individuals age 55 and older along with those with one underlying medical condition.
The general public in Massachusetts will be eligible to receive the vaccine beginning April 19, once Phase Three of the state vaccination timeline begins.
The council also unanimously passed a policy order for the City Manager to explore making remote participation in public meetings a permanent option for the future. Since the onset of the pandemic, City Council meetings have been held remotely, with residents calling in to make public comment.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon spoke about the “privilege” of in-person public comment participation. Mallon praised the remote public comment format for expanding access to the Council.
“It’s allowed us to hear from so many people that we’ve never heard from before, whether it’s parents who previously had childcare issues, young people who work in the evenings, residents with mobility issues, unhoused residents and more,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to go anywhere without encountering Harry Styles’ unparalleled, experimental, and often ‘70’s-inspired fashion sense. Whether someone is most familiar with Styles’ boy-band-cutie era or as an innovator in modern menswear, one can definitively say that the musician often lives up to his surname. Styles’ outfits at his most recent appearance at the 2021 GRAMMY Awards do not disappoint, as he continues to move fashion in a more gender-fluid direction.
Styles opened the award show wearing a full leather Gucci suit, which he accessorized with a light green feather boa — but his best look of the night was arguably the yellow plaid blazer and purple feather boa combination he wore to the red carpet. While Styles’ Grammy fashion may not have been as “groundbreaking” and controversial as some of his previous looks, such as his historic solo appearance on the Dec. 2020 cover of Vogue, he wore bright-colored boas, a piece of clothing most often associated with femininity. Nevertheless, it is hard to separate the fashion from the political statement it is inherently making.
The firmly established gender binary in fashion means that when men like Styles wear historically “feminine” clothing, it undoubtedly creates controversy (the dictionary definition for the word “dress” even states that it is an “outer garment for women and girls”). From his floral-print suits to his custom Gucci dress and newfound obsession with boas, Styles has consistently mixed elements of both masculinity and femininity into his sense of style, challenging the gender binary that many of his peers uphold. But why has Harry Styles since become the poster child for challenging toxic masculinity?
While Styles does bring necessary attention to the issue of toxic masculinity, particularly in regard to fashion, his position of privilege in society as a white man means that he takes up more space than the queer people of color who developed the fashion he now wears. Additionally, Styles’ refusal to put a label on his sexuality allows him to benefit from Black and queer culture for his aesthetic in a way that can be reckless and extremely damaging, while still being able to benefit from the privileges of being perceived as a straight. While labels are by no means necessary when it comes to sexuality and gender identity, as a highly influential and powerful public figure, Styles’ perceived distance from the queer community can allow his highly impressionable fan base to appropriate Black and queer culture without acknowledging its pioneers.
By centering Harry Styles, a white man, in the fight against toxic masculinity, we begin to celebrate white celebrities who present as existing beyond the gender binary at the expense of Black, Indigenous, and people of color. Styles’ androgynous sense of style is being held as the default while erasing and ignoring the existence of BIPOC individuals who have been doing the same thing for decades — such as Prince, Jamie Windust, Little Richard, Hari Nef, Lenny Kravitz, Alok V Menon, and Lil Nas X, to name a few.
Because the media has often tokenized queerness, the praise that Styles receives for his sense of style outside of the confines of the gender binary conveys the message that if you are white, straight-passing, famous, and conventionally attractive then you can dress in a gender-nonconforming way on the red carpet of an award show without worrying about becoming the next victim of a hate crime as many queer or nonbinary, especially Black gender non-conforming and transgender folk, have to worry about in their day-to-day lives.
Styles’ fashion sense can no longer be recklessly praised for pushing toward the abolition of gender norms and toxic masculinity. As stylish as Harry Styles may be, we must recognize that the gender binary itself is a tool of white supremacy and colonial violence, and must begin to move beyond putting cisgender white men, such as Styles, on a pedestal for doing what other celebrities — especially BIPOC and queer celebrities — have been doing for decades.

Oftentimes when Harvard students take a leave of absence or a summer job, the places they end up working are distinctly similar to Harvard: elitist institutions with fancy names in big cities.
In a departure from this common norm, I took an environmental advocacy job at Cook Inletkeeper, based in rural Homer, Alaska. CIK is a community-based nonprofit dedicated to protecting Alaska’s Cook Inlet watershed and the life it sustains. Returning eight months later, I brought back to Boston a new appreciation for the value of embracing “un-Harvard-like” experiences in teaching different perspectives on the issues we care about.
Apart from sharing bitterly cold winters, Homer could not be more different from Cambridge. If you drive south of Anchorage for four hours, until you cannot drive any further, you will reach the “Halibut Capital of the World,” a 6,150 person-strong coastal fishing town comprised of fishermen, environmental researchers and advocates, Russian Orthodox communities, Alaskan Native communities, and the seasonal crowd of tourists and summer staff.
While working and living in Homer, I learned about the state’s climate crisis by creating a report describing the costs of climate change on Alaska’s mining industry. Alaska is ground zero for the climate crisis. Its average temperature has risen by about 3 degrees Fahrenheit, more than twice the rate of warming throughout the rest of the U.S., increasing instances of drought and wildfires.
Alaska’s abundant salmon runs, and the people and ecosystems that rely on them, are also at risk because of climate change. The rising temperatures of freshwater streams, alongside ocean acidification, is making salmon more susceptible to predators, parasites, and disease. Smaller salmon runs would weaken the $5.6 billion seafood industry, reduce tourism revenue, and threaten the food supply that has made up a significant proportion of local Yup’ik Eskimo, Alutiiq, and Athabaskan diets for countless generations.
The perception that liberal environmentalists often have of conservatives and fossil fuel industry employees is that these individuals choose not to see the changing climate, or don’t care to understand its cause. Eight months of interacting with the Homer community challenges this assumption.
One particularly un-Harvard-like experience highlights my own lessons learned. As the volunteer coordinator for Homer’s annual electronic recycling event, I led a team of hearty volunteers in taking electronic garbage out of car trunks and loading it onto pallets and then into a truck bed to be recycled, while rain and wind left us shivering and muddy.
The diversity of community members in support of the event was remarkable. Hundreds of cars passed by our scrappy drive-through that day. We collected and sorted two dozen four-by-four pallets worth of junk, enough to fill two 12-wheeler truck beds. The people who dropped off their recyclables were not just granola advocates like myself, though there were plenty of us: There was a multitude of people with MAGA hats, big guns, and hefty pickup trucks that day doing their part to preserve Alaska’s wilderness.
Despite having a strong wildlife conservation constituency, Alaskans are also dependent on environmentally destructive but lucrative oil, gas, and mining industries. Without a broad-based income tax, oil industry taxes made up about 81 percent of the state’s total revenue before oil prices crashed in 2020, giving the industry massive political influence over state climate change policy. In this way, Alaska’s economy is simultaneously reliant on and vulnerable to climate change.
It is so easy to stereotype those you disagree with and simplify complexities while studying issues as dire as climate change from an arms-length, especially in communities as politically homogeneous as Cambridge. Such generalizations fall apart when you get to know the people whose livelihoods rely on the fossil fuel industry. Many Alaskans work for the oil and gas industry, not because they deny climate change, but because they need high-paying jobs to support their families.
To be certain, close encounters with bears may not be everyone’s ideal summer vacation. There is also much important work to be done at powerful institutions in urban areas — corporate giants must begin by rectifying their past environmental and social injustices. Further, interactions with communities that are not your own need to be done respectfully, and with tremendous care, especially during Covid-19 when social services and health care in rural communities are difficult to access. I also acknowledge my own privilege that allowed me to make a cross-continental move.
There are, however, countless other un-Harvard-like experiences to gain new perspectives from, which students can respectfully embrace. During the school year, perhaps try out a new non-quintessential Harvard club to meet people with different life experiences or develop a new interest. I hope to spend a lot more time in Harvard’s outdoor spaces, even though I will need to forgive the lack of glaciers in New England’s forests. Students can also apply to study or work in less popular travel locations during summer break or on a leave of absence.
Whether or not rural Alaska is the right fit, I hope everyone can find their Homer and bring the lessons they’ve learned back to Harvard. Imagine how much more we would all learn and grow.

Harvard Kennedy School anticipates reopening its campus in late summer, Dean Doug W. Elmendorf ’85 announced in an email to students, staff, and faculty Thursday.
Elmendorf wrote in the message that the school’s early summer programming will remain virtual, but the Kennedy School intends to hold some in-person gatherings for their mid-career program and incoming students in August.
“For the summer, mid-career summer program from early July to early August will be online, and we will plan for portions of the Mason fall launch to occur in person in the second half of August,” Elmendorf wrote.
“We will also plan for opportunities later in August for members of the mid-career class to gather in person for community-building activities and for incoming students in our other programs to engage in some orientation and pre-orientation activities on campus,” he added.
Though the school plans for almost all of its fall programs to take place in person, Elmendorf wrote that these plans are likely, but not certain.
“Our plans to be on campus are conditional on the leaders of Massachusetts and Harvard concluding that vaccinations, masking, testing, good ventilation, and other protocols are sufficient to protect health so that distancing protocols can be relaxed enough that we can achieve something close to our normal density.”
He noted that, if it is not safe to return to classes in-person, the Kennedy School will pursue online learning options.
“If, instead, we need to continue to adhere to much lower density, then we will need to limit our in-person activities,” he wrote. “For classes, that may require teaching and learning in a simultaneous-hybrid model; for other activities, that may require continued use of online methods.”
In a separate congratulatory letter sent to accepted master’s degree candidates, the school said students should be prepared for in-person instruction in Cambridge.
“We are planning for in-person classes, although we are also developing backup plans in case health protocols set by Massachusetts and Harvard University this Fall limit the allowable density on campus,” the letter reads.
Elmendorf said in the Thursday announcement that the school will expand remote work options for staff as it prepares to reopen in the fall.
“We understand that the return to campus will be complicated for some faculty, staff, and fellows—and more concerning and difficult for some than for others,” he wrote.
Elmendorf wrote that the Kennedy School will work to provide as “much advance notice as possible” about the reopening process.
“We will accommodate individual needs as much as we can while ensuring that we meet our collective responsibilities,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2012, the biotechnology firm Amgen attempted to replicate “landmark” research on blood disorders and cancer. They chose 53 studies that had been cited and circulated widely, all of which described novel findings or approaches for cancer treatment.
But they were unsuccessful. Despite attempting to work closely with each study’s original authors to accurately replicate the experiments’ materials and procedures, only six of the studies could be replicated.
This isn’t an isolated incident: One study found that of 83 highly cited publications on psychiatric treatments, only 43 had been subject to replication, and 27 were contradicted or found to have substantially smaller effects than initially reported. Another study claims that up to $28.2 billion is spent annually in the U.S. on preclinical research that can’t be reproduced. These and other statistics sent shock waves across the scientific community, prompting debates to address the so-called “replicability crisis” in science that continues to this day.
I won’t pretend I can satisfyingly explain or answer these phenomena in a column. But it is worthwhile to explore what has led to this lack of replicability. How do we mend it? And more broadly speaking, considering the inherent heterogeneity and uncertainty in science, is it possible?
When it comes to questions of replicability, it can be easy to think of instances of fraudulent conduct, like the scandal Harvard faced in 2018 when it turned out that 31 publications on heart muscle regeneration via stem cell treatment by Harvard Medical School researcher Piero Anversa contained fabricated or falsified data. These instances of dishonesty will continue happening.
But oftentimes studies can’t be replicated for decisions that are more unintentionally or even unconsciously made.
For example, the “same” cell lines can be dramatically different across labs. According to Phillip Sharp, a professor of biology at MIT and winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, current models using cell lines vary immensely from lab to lab and experiment to experiment.
“A lot of the lack of reproducibility in some cancer models, which is really a major part of literature now, is the use of cells that we call HeLa, or other cancer cells,” he said in an interview. Sharp co-chaired a 2009 National Academies of Sciences report on data integrity, accessibility, and stewardship.
According to him, these cells are “genetically unstable by their nature” and tending to them “in different conditions, different nutrients, different times, different temperatures, whatever” can often produce wildly different results — “not one in a million but one in 10!”
While there are efforts to use more shared cell lines or animal models with immune systems that can better model human disease, a lack of replicability stems from a deeper, systemic incentive structure, according to Jonathan Kimmelman, director of the Biomedical Ethics Unit at McGill University.
“Oftentimes, incentives in research are structured in a way that is not necessarily maximally aligned to producing unbiased and precise estimates around causal claims,” Kimmelman said in an interview.
“If your salary, if your ability to earn grants is going to be based on publications in New England Journal of Medicine or publications in Nature, et cetera, there are lots of different ways that you might, as a scientist, subconsciously interpret some of your findings in ways that are more sympathetic to that positive result than they should be,” he said.
There are scholars that say there isn’t a replicability crisis. A 2019 report from the Committee on Reproducibility and Replicability in Science from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine stated that “there seems to be an emerging consensus that it is not helpful, or justified, to refer to psychology as in a state of crisis.” Per the report, “we don’t have enough information to provide an estimate with any certainty for any individual field or even across fields in general.”
Sure, we still have to figure out the exact extent of science’s lack of replicability, but that shouldn’t be an excuse to downplay the issue. That same committee notes that finding previous studies not replicable can even be helpful when it reveals “inherent but uncharacterized uncertainties in the system being studied.”
Sharp says science is “a process by which the human mind has discerned that we can interrogate the physical external world to learn material truths.” According to him, “we're always interpreting.”
If ten chefs follow the same recipe but get nine different dishes, perhaps that reveals more about the complexity and unpredictability of science. Better understanding this inherent complexity and seeing science’s limitations, then, even if uncomfortable, is a worthwhile investigation.
So what mechanisms can ensure scientific integrity? The committee’s report offers a few solutions, many of which seem more like common sense than glamorous. Publish more negative results; establish requirements for thorough and easily accessible code and data, especially as computational research increases; implement training for record-keeping and ethical consideration; and create and secure open-source infrastructure.
These mechanisms won’t be enough, but they are a necessary start. Science’s lack of replicability is an issue with incredible nuance, one that warrants much more consideration than a declaration to publish all negative results or bolster funding incentives. Scientific integrity is paramount for researchers, administrators, and journals alike.
“Science has its value based on what it could do to promote human knowledge,” Insoo Hyun, a bioethics professor at Case Western University and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, told me. “It kind of has this consequentialist goal: better produce something worthwhile.”
Therefore, a lack of replicability, whether intentional or not, becomes unethical.
“You want your scientific experiment to be meaningful,” Hyun said. “But if it's not — if it's not set up to actually help expand knowledge or translated benefits for patients and society — you're actually doing a great ethical disservice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Responding to recent reports of a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, the Undergraduate Council unanimously passed legislation Sunday that enables the organization to match student donations to a fundraiser organized by a coalition of Asian American student groups.
Through the legislation, the UC will match student donations of up to $1,000 made to the Harvard Asian American Coalition’s fundraiser, which will allocate funds to national and local organizations committed to supporting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Groups who make up the coalition include Harvard Tapas, the Harvard Asian American Association, and the Harvard Radcliffe Chinese Americans Association.
The UC also endorsed a statement authored by student organizers of the fundraiser condemning anti-Asian hate.
“Asian hate is not a new phenomenon,” the statement reads. “Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been combatting vitriol, violence, and xenophobia for as long as we have been in the United States.”
The statement cites a report published by the reporting center Stop AAPI Hate that traced 3,795 anti-Asian hate crimes during the past year. The center also found that women are nearly two-and-a-half times more likely to report attacks than men.
The organizers’ statement also calls on students to take “unequivocal and unrelenting action” in light of last week’s shooting in Atlanta, which included six Asian American women among its casualties.
“Tuesday’s massacre underscores the intersecting systems of white supremacist violence against Asian women, im/migrants, sex workers, and working-class Asians in our communities,” the statement reads.
The legislation was sponsored by Director of Belonging and Inclusion Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, Treasurer Edwin B. "Eddie" Jin ’24, Adams House representative Esther J. Xiang ’23, Crimson Yard representative Shreya P. Nair ’24, and Elm Yard representative Anant P. Rajan ’24.
The Council also endorsed an open letter to the University condemning University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s guidance from an email to affiliates last week responding to the recent surge in anti-Asian hate crimes.
In his email, Bacow referred affiliates to contact the Harvard University Police Department if they are the victim of a “racist attack.”
The legislation allows the Council to sign a student-organized petition that calls Bacow’s advice a “failure.”
“President Bacow used Tuesday’s shootings to validate HUPD’s existence and justify their continued threat of violence,” the letter reads. “HUPD is an unacceptable and harmful remedy to anti-Asian violence in our community.”
The petition cited The Crimson’s 2020 reporting that exposed racist and sexist incidents within the University’s police department spanning the past three decades.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the UC’s endorsement of the petition.
The legislation, sponsored by Cabot House Representative Brooke L. Livingston ’23, was passed with a vote of 24-0-1.
Also at Sunday’s meeting, the Council endorsed a legal complaint filed last week by Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard with Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92. The complaint alleges Harvard’s investments in the fossil fuel industry — which amount to less than two percent of the University’s endowment — violate the Massachusetts Uniform Prudential Management of Institutional Funds Act.
Per the legal complaint, the Harvard Corporation — Harvard’s highest governing board — is violating a provision of the Massachusetts law, which states that nonprofits have a duty to make investments with “charitable purposes.”
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the UC's endorsement of the petition.
The legislation was sponsored by Adams House representative Jordan H. Barton ’23, Pfirzheimer House representative Ruy A. Martinez ’22, and Dunster House representative Juan C. Venancio ’23, with “citizen sponsorship” from fossil fuel divestment activists Connor Chung ’23 and Martha J. Denton ’23.
The body also endorsed a joint statement calling on Harvard to designate Election Day as a University holiday. The UC passed a similar piece of legislation in October 2020.
The legislation was sponsored by several house representatives and Lily Richman ’24 and Alexander K. Park ’23, both members of Harvard Votes Challenge, a student organization focused on increasing voter turnout at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council heard a presentation on University finances and approved a memorandum recommending extended access to Harvard email addresses during a public meeting Wednesday evening, which took place just hours after the Council passed an emergency resolution in response to last week’s shootings in Atlanta, Ga.
The shootings, which targeted three spas, left eight dead — six of whom were of Asian descent.
“March 16, 2021 marked a dark day of mass murder, on which a white man, armed with a deadly weapon, murdered eight people in Atlantan spas in cold blood,” the resolution reads. “Far from being an isolated incident, this is only the latest of decades and centuries of injustices against vulnerable populations in the United States and incidents of violence against Asians, Asian-Americans, and Pacific Islanders have sharply risen during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The resolution urges the University to expand and democratize counseling and mental health services in response to these events, promote reporting resources for students who have experienced and witnessed racial hate crimes, and foster University-wide conversations “to openly address grievances of this nature,” among other action items.
The resolution passed unanimously by all 12 schools.
Later on Monday, the Council convened for its regular meeting to hear Catherine Brennan, David W. White, and Julia Falkoff of Harvard’s Office of Financial Strategy and Planning speak about the breakdown of the University’s revenue streams, its endowment, the impact of Covid-19 on its finances.
After posing questions about how the University uses its endowment in difficult times, the Council moved on to entertaining a motion to approve a memorandum on lifetime University emails.
The memorandum — addressed to the Office of the Provost, the Harvard Alumni Association, and the CIO Council — urges the University to extend current Harvard email access for undergraduate and graduate students graduating in the class of 2021 for a minimum of 2 years, but recommends lifetime access to emails across all schools.
“Without a Harvard email, graduates experience longer response times on job leads because they are forced to send emails from an unrecognized email that is not affiliated with the University,” the memorandum reads.
Chair of Advocacy Abhinaya Narayanan said these recommendations follow the precedent of lifelong University emails for schools including the Law School and the Business School, as well as peer institutions including Yale.
“It’s an issue of equity, especially for students from underrepresented backgrounds, low-income backgrounds,” she said. “A Harvard network is so critical, and losing access to it when you graduate — especially in the midst of a pandemic — is an issue.”
The motion to approve the memorandum passed unanimously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Welcome to you, welcome to your drag aesthetic and your people, again, the ones that we honor, the ones that we create these personas around, some known, some unknown.” These words marked the beginning of “The Lunch Room: Drag Roundtable,“ a virtual panel on drag culture hosted by the American Repertory Theater on March 16.
It’s been over a year since the A.R.T. closed its doors due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the theater continues to provide a variety of virtual programming, including “The Lunch Room,“ a free weekly virtual talk show featuring artists, activists, and civic leaders. Last week’s installment was hosted by drag queen Nina Fahari and featured three speakers: Jayden Jamison, the drag king persona of Quyen Tran; professor Dr. Kareem Khubchandani, who performs as LaWhore Vagistan; and drag queen Just JP.
Mark Lunsford, the Artistic Producer at the A.R.T. who has hosted “The Lunch Room“ in the past, said that the series was created to connect artists and audiences during the pandemic through a “grab bag” of “eclectic” conversations.
“In the beginning we were really focusing [on] direct artist conversation,” Lunsford said, “and now we’ve really tried to expand that into thinking about [the A.R.T.] as a cultural institution and what kind of cultural conversations we want to be in with partners, whether they be in the performing arts or not.” Specifically, he explained, the decision to feature drag performers was influenced by the importance of the drag to the audiences at Oberon, the A.R.T.’s club venue.
The panelists spoke about creating their drag personas, utilizing their performances for education and activism, and performing virtually during Covid. One theme that emerged in the roundtable conversation was the importance of personal identity and culture in shaping their personas. Khubchandani said that he chose the name LaWhore Vagistan (a play on “Lahore,” a city in Pakistan) in response to growing up outside the Indian subcontinent, even though his family is from Pakistan. His drag persona is also inspired by his mother and aunties, who allowed him to express himself outside of the conventions of masculinity.
Tran also cited personal identity as an important factor in her drag experience, explaining that creating Jayden Jamison’s persona (whose aesthetic she describes as “pretty gay boy twink”) helped her gain confidence as a Vietnamese lesbian who “didn’t feel seen or desired” within the BGLTQ community when she came out, due to assumptions about Asians being “studious” or “geeky” instead of possible romantic partners. Being able to inhabit a confident persona, she said, allowed her to become more confident in herself.
The panelists also spoke about using drag as activism. As the only drag king on the panel, Jamison spoke in an interview about feeling a responsibility to raise awareness of the drag king community. He also spoke about using his platform amid recent racist attacks against Asians, saying that even though he sometimes doesn’t feel accepted by his community, he wants to use his platform to advocate for them. Khubchandani also expressed his desire to carve out space for people of color in what he described as a predominantly white drag scene in Boston.
In an interview, Just JP spoke about the challenges of performing explicitly political numbers such as a number criticizing Christopher Columbus, which they first performed for Indigenous People’s Day 2017. Just JP claimed they have faced reluctance from some event organizers to book them, because they are “too political.”
“Sometimes their audiences don’t want to listen to politics and they just want to have a good time, and I understand that,” Just JP said. They emphasized, however, that they would continue to perform these numbers.
The panelists also discussed how virtual platforms created challenges during the pandemic, such as the difficulty of attracting an online audience. However, Khubchandani pointed out that these platforms have the ability to connect performers globally. The panelists also highlighted the importance of mutual aid and the necessity of tipping drag performers, many of whom face financial struggles because the current public health restrictions limit their opportunities to perform.
Fahari, who was the first person outside of the A.R.T. staff to host “The Lunch Room,“ said she saw hosting the roundtable as an opportunity to foster human connections in the midst of “a deep moment of isolation.” “[This decision] showed how an institute can turn over its platforms to partners and individuals,” Fahari said. As the series continues, the A.R.T. will have more opportunities for this community engagement.
The A.R.T. will continue to host “The Lunch Room“ events. Guests this week include New Mass Cultural Council Executive Director Michael J. Bobbitt and the A.R.T.’s Terrie and Bradley Bloom Artistic Director, Diane Paulus.
The March 16 event can be viewed on YouTube.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pandemic that shuttered Broadway and silenced urban theaters everywhere has in turn given an opportunity to unlikely heroes of the arts world: regional theaters with real estate.
In Western Mass, the Berkshire Theatre Group is capitalizing on their momentum from two successful in-person productions in 2020 as they plan their 2021 season.
As infections raged across America last summer, the BTG produced Stephen Schwartz’s 1971 musical “Godspell” in the parking lot of the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield. Carefully distanced and masked audiences filled the tent from the show’s open in August to its extended close in late September. That success was followed by a chilly outdoor staging of “Holiday Memories,” a play based on Truman Capote short stories, which took place between Thanksgiving and Christmas in the corner of a set-building barn outside the Unicorn Theater in Stockbridge.
Massachusetts’ longitudinal divide pits the urban and suburban easterners, for whom even Springfield is an abstract concept, against the sparser westerners, jaded by the literal and metaphorical distance between them and Beacon Hill. Yet every June, the arts capital of Massachusetts shifts from Boston to Berkshire County. Patrons have their choice of Tanglewood in Lenox, the summer home of the Boston Symphony; Jacob’s Pillow in Becket, for an international summer dance festival; and performances by theater groups like the Williamstown Theater Festival in Williamstown and the Berkshire Theatre Group in Pittsfield and Stockbridge, among others.
“The Berkshires really rely on summer,” Robert Morrison, a service industry expert in the Berkshire region, said. “Last summer really decimated some bottom lines. We’re going to engage the arts crowd more this summer.” He detailed plans for attracting arts patrons and other tourists into downtown Pittsfield, on their way to or from performances.
While the rural nature of Massachusetts’ westernmost county poses a challenge to small businesses, the low density is a blessing for pandemic-era theater. The programming at Boston and Cambridge’s urban theater giants, like the Huntington Theater Company on Huntington Ave., American Repertory Theater on Brattle St., and Emerson College on the corner of Boylston and Tremont St. remains exclusively virtual. Meanwhile, the wide open spaces of the Berkshires make safer, outdoor performances more possible.
Safety concerns in the theater are nothing new. From occupational safety and actor health to the safety of expression in the #MeToo and other social justice movements, dealing with vulnerabilities on both sides of the curtain is more than ever part of theater’s work. For the BTG, the addition of Covid safety had to become part of the greater artistic vision.
“A theater company creates its own world, and the world has to be one of safety,” BTG Artistic Director and CEO Kate Maguire said. “We have to be safe because of the virus, but there are other ways in a theater community that we find ourselves wanting to be safe. Safety has become an all-encompassing thing.”
But a performance that satisfied the artistic requirements of Schwartz’s musical and the safety protocols of the Actors’ Equity Association, the union that represents many BTG actors and stage managers, was no walk in the park.
“I was on the phone with them, or our company manager was on the phone with them on a daily basis for two months,” Maguire said. “How far do the particles go when someone is singing? Can the actors go into each others’ spaces even? How do the actors move on stage? Do they have to have masks on at all?”
Isabel Jordan, a member of the ensemble and a senior at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, remembers the extra safety measures as all-encompassing in the rehearsal and performance process.
“From the second we knew the show was happening for real, we immediately hopped on a Zoom call with everyone to review safety procedures,” she said. The company worked with the AEA to provide an extensive safety manual, personal boxes of supplies to eliminate sharing, and lots of sanitation supplies. “Communication lines were always open to talk about safety. There was an emphasis on it every single day.”
Further solutions included clear plastic partitions between actors that became part of the set, some mask-wearing, and an excision of wind instruments from the pit. The result was a staging of “Godspell” that took a unique liberty with the musical, which loosely follows the Gospel of Matthew’s recounting of Jesus’ last days.
“Why can’t the play just be set in the time of Covid, completely?” Maguire said.
In a new introduction to the piece, actors spoke briefly about their experiences struggling over the past months, from experiences of racial bias, to mental health, to simple bewilderment at the state of the world. It was truly a “Godspell” of our time, not in spite of it.
In December, BTG’s “Holiday Memories” presented still more challenges. Though simpler to stage, the issues of below-freezing temperatures and rising case numbers around the country made for a run on thin ice. The audience was limited to 25, with distancing requirements.
“The show was sold out every night, 25 people every night,” Maguire said. She was unsurprised that people still came despite the stubborn mercury. “It’s the Berkshires, I know our people here.”
Going forward, it is impossible to tell what parts of pandemic theater will stick, and what will get left behind in 2020. While the artistic opportunities afforded by outdoor theater can bolster the immersive experience of a performance, other issues, like decreased audience capacity (which increases ticket prices) and uncertain weather make the traditional indoor theater a much surer bet.
To Maguire, however, the question of theater’s future is not where, but who.
“Mostly, I’m looking to [the younger] generation to fix the world,” she said. “The number of harms that have been caused over the past several years, leading towards this and all that was revealed to us, watching and listening to people speak to each other in ways that often felt violent — how do we heal ourselves and come out of this? It’s theater in 2030. Where do we go in the next ten years?”
Jordan argued that young people must have a place in the conversation, especially since the issues tackled on stage mirror the issues of the broader world.
“We have to do our jobs as upright citizens and express ourselves in any way we can, until these injustices are rectified,” she said. “The world is changing, and our voices matter now more than ever. We deserve to be on that higher platform. We deserve for our voices to have more weight.”
“It’s the role of the artist to tell those truths we need to hear,” says Maguire.

Welcome, freshmen, to upperclassmen housing (and also to the sophomores who never got a chance to really experience their House — we love you, too). As you make the transition into House life, we’ve got the hot tips and helpful advice to really immerse yourself, from none other than your House Committee (HoCo) Chairs who also happen to write for Flyby. #it’s #a #crossover #episode!
It’s all about the people. — Maranda Ngue ’22, Kirkland House
The library may be cozy and the dining hall may look beautiful, but at the heart of every House lies the people! Regardless of which House you’re in, get to know the tutors, administrators, and upperclassmen. Everyone already in the House will teach you the chant, invite you to HoCo events, motivate-slash-beg you to participate in intramural sports (go K-Force!!!), and shower you with more merch than you know what to do with. The faculty deans happily welcome students with open arms and are eager to meet new faces. The tutors have so much advice to offer about topics that range from medical school applications to work-life balance. Many of them also recently attended Harvard as undergrads, so they know Harvard lingo and life like the back of their hand. Moreover, the upperclassmen pave the way for you. They are willing to help you navigate all the House resources and traditions, such as Kirkland’s Boat Club, which is all about cookies and nothing about boats. And last but definitely not least, the dining hall workers are truly the sweetest people in the world, making you smile at the most stressful times and keeping your belly full every single day. Essentially, meet as many people as you can and you’ll find a new home away from home!
Find your own ~niche~ — Rachel L. Reynolds ’22, Lowell House
When you first hear about “House community,” it can feel like a vague sort of umbrella term – you might not really know what that actually means, or who’s in it, or why everyone’s constantly talking about this or that House’s amazing community. Yet, something I realized once I was actually in the House was that this “vague-ness” was purposeful; your experience of House life really is shaped around whatever you want to make it. If you’re really into arts, nearly every House has some physical arts spaces, arts tutors, or annual artistic events (like Lowell House Opera or Cabot Musical). If your thing is sports (whether you’re a soccer #pro or an inner tube water polo fanatic), you’ll love the excitement around intramurals and easy access to House gyms. For those clamoring for advice and mentorship from actual real adults, you’ll find an incredibly helpful tutor, dean, or another member of the House staff around nearly every corner. Or in the end if you’re really just there for fun socializing, the lovely people in each House’s HoCo could always use some extra help ;) (shameless plug) No matter what House you’re in, there is sure to be a tutor, an event, or an actual physical space for literally anything you need (or they’ll give you the space to create it!) — all you have to do is be willing to explore<3
Get involved (at least a little.) — Kiana Ziadkhanpour ’22, Pforzheimer House 
It may just all seem like a lot, especially when you have to introduce yourself with what House you’re in (when you’ve never even stepped foot inside), but truthfully House culture and community can grow to be an integral part of your time at Harvard — or at the very least, a happy addition. Truthfully, I never thought that I would be part of HoCo, let alone a co-chair, but if you buy into House culture a bit, you’ll get so much out of it. So click on that Zoom link and fill in a form — you might get some free food or merch, but you’ll also get a chance to meet new people and make your House feel a bit more like home (sounds cheesy and cliché, but that doesn’t make it any less true). Also, the Quad is a lovely place with its own traditions and community! Don’t let people’s negativity frame your existence and happiness with your living situation.
Head first, Fearless — Rocket Claman ’21.5, Leverett House
When I transferred to Leverett House my junior spring, I was worried about finding my home in the largest House community. But I remembered Neal Caffrey saying “people talk to the bartender!” in an episode of White Collar, and I realized joining HoCo (whose members, incidentally, bartend weekly Steins) was the perfect way for me to meet other Leverites. I was welcomed immediately with open arms. And here I am, a year later, as co-chair! Every House on campus has unique charms, quirks, and traditions, but at their core, they aim to help students feel supported (academically and otherwise), make friends, and have fun. There’s a whole team of people who work to make your House experience the best it can be. Tutors, for example, are a key foundation of a House. They function very differently from proctors, and while they can be mentors, they’re also people with whom you can sit down on a whim in the dining hall and have a fun and casual conversation. HoCo exists to realize your visions for House life — you have agency in shaping your experience. While the House community doesn’t need to be the center of your time at Harvard, going to events and meeting people outside of your social, academic, and extracurricular circles can only enrich your experience. At the very least, you’ll get free food! No matter what you’re looking for from your time in your House, upperclassmen, dining hall staff, security guards (shoutout to Mike at Lev), faculty deans, and tutors will be there to help you find it. And, fingers crossed, we’ll see you on campus in the fall. We’re ready to make your first semester in the House exceed your wildest dreams.
So, TLDR; if you’re new to House life, you’re in for a fantastic time! Here’s hoping this fall is full of exploring cool common spaces, gatherings with free food, and a whole lot of House spirit.

Thirty-five percent of respondents to The Crimson’s annual survey of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences said they believe at least one colleague in their department was unjustly denied tenure, with a quarter indicating they “strongly believe” an unjust tenure denial had occurred.
Following Harvard’s decision in November 2019 to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Loriga García Peña, the University received scrutiny into its tenure processes, particularly whether it fairly evaluates scholars of color.
The University’s tenure procedures recently came under fire again after Professor Cornel R. West ’74 said in February that the University initially denied a request to consider him for tenure, prompting his announced departure to Union Theological Seminary.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay launched a review of the FAS’s tenure processes in December 2019. In an interview with The Crimson in March, Gay said that the review’s findings are expected to be released later this spring.
The Crimson distributed its faculty survey to more than 1,100 members of the FAS in late February, polling Harvard’s flagship faculty on key University policy decisions, challenges they face as academics, and pressing issues on campus — including the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty all received the survey.
The 94-question survey obtained more than 300 responses, though not all respondents answered each question. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from Feb. 26 to Mar. 5. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The first installment of The Crimson’s 2021 faculty survey series explores faculty views on the University’s tenure procedures.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on the findings.
Harvard often cites teaching and research as core tenets of its mission, but faculty responses to the survey indicate that research is the much stronger consideration in tenure cases. Asked what they believe was the primary factor for their tenure, fewer than two percent of respondents who indicated they were tenured faculty named teaching — whether graduate or undergraduate — as the most important factor. In contrast, 86 percent of tenured respondents said they believed research played the biggest role in Harvard’s decision to grant them tenure.
Among survey-takers who identified themselves as associate or assistant professors, 40 percent indicated the FAS has not given them enough flexibility to choose how to allot their time between research, teaching, and mentorship.
Non-tenure-track faculty respondents were not posed this survey question. However, earlier this month, the FAS Preceptor System Review Committee — charged last year with recommending changes to the roles of preceptor and senior preceptor — released a final report that framed preceptors and senior preceptors’ roles as purely teaching positions. This distinction spurred disappointment among preceptors who highlighted the necessity of research credentials to apply for jobs after Harvard. In an emailed statement earlier this month, Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser wrote that preceptors “are hired to teach not to conduct research.”
Forty-three percent of all surveyed faculty indicated they were somewhat strongly, strongly, or very strongly considering job offers they had received from outside of Harvard. Among the non-tenure-track faculty who responded to the survey, this number increased to 58 percent.
In response to a question about whether the University should grant tenure to West — asked prior to West’s announcement of his departure to Union — faculty responses indicated a wide range of opinions. Thirty-seven percent of respondents believed that Harvard should grant tenure to West, with 25 percent strongly agreeing. Twenty-two percent of respondents, however, did not believe Harvard should grant tenure to West, with 15 percent strongly disagreeing.
While about a quarter of respondents overall said they strongly believe at least one colleague in their department was unjustly denied tenure, opinions differed based on respondents’ disciplines.
Seventeen percent of respondents in the Sciences division strongly agreed at least one departmental colleague was unjustly denied tenure, compared to 22 percent in the Arts and Humanities, 29 percent in the Social Sciences, and 39 percent in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Surveyed faculty overwhelmingly supported the FAS review of tenure procedures, which launched in January 2020 and is set to conclude this spring: over three-quarters of respondents agreed with Dean Gay’s decision to form the committee. Notably, however, the committee is not reviewing the use of ad hoc committees within the process because they take place at the University-level.
Junior faculty members pursuing tenure spend seven to eight years managing a rigorous teaching and advising schedule combined with independent research. At the end of this period, junior faculty hopefuls go through several rounds of evaluation by their peers, during which time they may be recommended for tenure by their department.
After approval by the Committee on Appointments and Promotions and FAS Dean, tenure cases then often proceed to consideration by an ad hoc faculty committee, which is chaired by the president or provost and whose composition is secret. The ad hoc committee advises the president or provost, who makes the final decision.
Nearly thirty-eight percent of survey-takers believed that the procedure for granting tenure should conclude with a confidential ad hoc committee, while 31 percent disagreed. Opinions regarding the use of ad hoc committees also varied across the FAS’s three academic divisions — 46 percent of respondents in the Social Sciences said they believe tenure review should conclude in the hands of an ad hoc committee, compared to 32 percent in the Arts and Humanities and 37 percent in the Sciences.
For its 2021 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from Feb. 26 to March 5, 2021. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,182 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in February 2021 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS affiliations, including tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty.
Of those faculty, 315 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 309 participants answered at least one question, while 235 participants completed every question in the survey.
To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, minority background, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents, 38 percent identified themselves as women and 19 percent identified themselves as minorities. Based on data in the 2020 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 32 percent and 25 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
According to the Dean’s report, 41 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty — a term synonymous with non-tenure-track faculty. By contrast, 39 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 106 — or 9 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 6 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second semester of organizing, a group of Genetics postdoctoral and graduate student activists launched an offshoot team tasked with increasing support for custodial staff members and providing them with Covid-19 vaccine information in Spanish.
The Harvard Medical School Genetics Anti-Racism Group — which was formed last fall to implement anti-racist initiatives at the school and foster diversity in science — gathered volunteers for this new initiative at its second Town Hall on Feb. 26.
Since then, the resulting seven-person team has been holding weekly Q&A sessions to answer any questions custodial staff members have surrounding the vaccine and how to receive it.
HMS Genetics postdoctoral fellows Israel Pichardo-Casas and Yasmin Escobedo Lozoya began leading teach-ins in Spanish to disseminate information about Covid-19 testing last fall and winter. Some custodians at HMS do not speak fluent English and, as a result, did not fully understand how to access testing information and results online.
Jean I. Phane, a custodian at HMS and a shop steward for 32BJ Service Employees International Union, brought these issues to the student activists’ attention when he approached the group last fall.
Pichardo-Casas and Escobedo Lozoya continue to translate information to Spanish for staff members during the new team’s teach-ins about vaccines.
“Some of those questions were around which brand to use, whether there are risks,” Pichardo-Casas said. “People have known to have side effects in some instances, so they want to have a reference.”
Activist and genetics research fellow Marta Florio said the HMS custodial staff asked thoughtful questions.
“They had concerns about the comorbidity of other diseases,” Florio said. “Now after talking to us, I think some of them seem way more convinced that it's a good idea to get vaccines.”
In addition to the Q&A sessions, Florio said she hopes the team’s work can expand into Cambridge. She specifically envisions setting up kiosks where volunteers can help anyone pre-register for the vaccine. According to Florio, people who are excluded from networks of information sharing — either due to their language or other factors — may be uncertain about when and how they can receive their vaccines given pre-existing conditions.
“I hope that being reassured that they can be guided in the process of setting up an appointment may make a difference,” Florio said.
Genetics researcher Heather L. de Rivera, who formally joined the new initiative after last month’s town hall, has found the opportunity to connect with HMS custodial staff members “rewarding.”
“It's nice to see and make connections with people that I wouldn't necessarily run into every day or might not have the time to stop and talk to,” de Rivera said. “The human connection part of it — especially now, during the late stages of this pandemic — [is] pretty rewarding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In these tumultuous times, we all could use a little more magic and wonder in our lives. Enter the American Repertory Theater’s newest show “The Conjurors’ Club,” an 80-minute sleight-of-hand extravaganza filled with talented magicians and interactive activities. Each showing features a different subset of the two hosts and nine magicians that constitute the mystical society, ensuring that no two nights are the same.
Co-creator and host Geoff Kanick sets the active and engaging tone for the show immediately by asking the audience to keep their cameras on and mics ready to be unmuted for the whole performance, breaking what has become an established rule of virtual theater. Soon after this reversal of expectations, Kanick invites audience members to open the mysterious packages sent to their homes in advance, and Kanick uses the objects in the package to lead viewers through small magic tricks of their own. By simply attending the show, audience members are deemed honorary members of this magical community. Viewers are continually encouraged to interact with the production, its magicians, and the world of magic even after the virtual curtains close through the production’s website. Through this enthusiastic invitation, “The Conjurors’ Club” fosters meaningful relationships between artist and audience, restoring the feeling of connection that has been painfully absent from the world of online theater.
Not only does the show’s format prioritize forging bonds across virtual time and space, but it also ensures that each audience gets a completely unique experience. As the performers emphasize, each specific show could only happen at one time (though, as Kanick notes, time itself is fluid), and only with the exact group of people who make up the audience. If any element of the show were changed, it wouldn’t be the same performance. One could go to “The Conjurors’ Club” multiple times and, with different combinations of performers and viewers, have an undoubtedly different experience.
This ethos is supported by the layout and staging of the show. After the host’s introductions, participants are assigned to smaller breakout rooms to create small, close-knit communities within the audience. Each magician visits each room separately, inviting frequent audience participation and input to make each and every moment feel precious. Even between sets, audience members are encouraged to maintain the energy of the show by discussing a reflective question posed by the exiting magician, effectively avoiding the lull that comes with the Zoom room shuffling. With these chances for connections, the audience has been brought to this virtual stage to experience not only the magic of illusions, but also the magic of togetherness.
Magic relies on an active audience, perhaps more than any other live art form. In a performance style that so often requires an active participant, half of the fun is watching the audience’s amazement. While the framing and management of the show alone cultivated an engaged viewership, “The Conjurors’ Club” was made extraordinary for the audience by the sheer talent and charisma of its magicians. The March 14 evening show featured three magicians: Ran’D Shine, Jeanette Andrews, and Eric Jones. Each brings their own special style of magic, presenting a series of tricks and illusions accentuated by powerful stage presence, humor, and mystique.
A distinctive benefit of a virtual magic show is the egalitarian viewing experience: Every audience member is the same distance away from the performer, and viewers get the opportunity to get up close and personal. While this intimacy puts pressure on the magical trio to be seamless in their illusions, it did not faze them in the slightest. Despite the high-resolution view the audience had of the magic acts, they maintained an aura of astonishment throughout, and not a single secret was revealed the entire night. Shine, Andrews, and Jones all amaze, leaving audiences to excitedly ponder the question: How did you do that?
“The Conjurors’ Club” utilizes Zoom’s functionalities and the intimacy of the webcam frame to cultivate a production bursting with energy and pizazz. The production, which runs through April 11, is timely, family-friendly, and one of the most fulfilling theatrical experiences currently available. While the magicians’ tricks remain undisclosed, the excitement and fun of “The Conjurors’ Club” is a secret that should be shared with everyone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say that history repeats itself; that we are all bound to trip twice (thrice even!) on the very same stone. Harvard might be about to make the same mistake for the third time, to the tune of nearly $25 million in stimulus funding.
A new round of pandemic relief payouts for colleges has arrived, which means another round of criticism sparked by the thought that Harvard might accept its allocated funds is likely around the corner.
The University has refused two Covid-19 stimulus checks: the first back in April, when attacks from several prominent conservatives and former President Donald Trump led the administration to decline almost $9 million in Congressionally-allocated funds, initially pledged entirely to augmenting student financial aid. In the next relief round last December, the University refused its allocated funding outright, losing out on another $7 million. Now, thanks to the recently passed “American Rescue Plan,” our institution may be eligible to receive another $25.5 million in not-yet materialized, yet hotly debated funding to be distributed according to this bill.
Except this time we shouldn’t turn it down. Harvard, just take the money.
Some will argue that Harvard, with its exceptionally well-endowed endowment, is hardly in need of money. These charges, while fair, have already been taken into consideration. President Joe Biden’s Rescue Plan, which has passed through Congress and already been signed into law, prioritized giving funding to schools with budgets under $1 million and those with a higher number of students on Pell Grants, among other factors. Under these constraints, Harvard still qualified to receive almost $25 million in aid. That’s just how the legislative process went — it’s not exactly like Harvard is stealing funds via a loophole.
So why now would we reject those funds if they could do significant good for our community?
It’s worth inspecting why this is a debate in the first place: Why has Harvard been the main focus of public scrutiny for considering accepting stimulus money in the past? It’s not as if there aren’t any more viable targets for public outcry. Universities that explicitly ban same-sex relationships have received funding through the past stimulus bills, as have for-profit (and often rampantly exploitative) educational programs. Should tax dollars really aid such institutions? No. Do they really have a better claim to federal funding than Harvard, despite its many flaws? Again, seemingly no. Yet when it comes to accepting a higher ed stimulus designated for it, Harvard finds itself, yet again, at the forefront of the political arena.
The University could again give in to a perhaps imminent public outcry against it receiving stimulus funds — or Harvard could put those funds to a worthwhile use. The latter seems clearly preferable.
We support Harvard, for once, taking the stimulus funding it's been allocated, though not unconditionally. The money needs to be used thoughtfully. That means, for one, complete transparency: Our community ought to know what Uncle Sam’s money is doing for us for the sake of good-governance and allowing informed debate on the matter. We also hope funding wouldn’t be allocated to ambitious new projects at a time when many of our own peers are struggling. We really don’t need any fancy new buildings. Similarly to how Harvard briefly committed 100 percent of the April stimulus to expanding financial aid to students amidst economic freefall, the University should make a clear, laudable commitment about where the stimulus will go.
We think the stimulus should go straight to students and employees, be it through expanded financial aid, increased support for first generation, low income students, generous travel assistance if necessary, or increased pay and job security for our deserving workers. That is, instead of refusing its allocated funds over faux populist, overdue concerns that Harvard is simply too wealthy, the University should direct the money it accepts towards members of our community in real need. After all, being a Harvard student or worker — custodian, graduate student, dining staff, or otherwise — doesn’t instantly save any affiliate from harsh economic conditions. Indeed, many students and workers have been open about the precarious economic position the past year has put them in. Many of our own have been hurt by the pandemic, and they deserve the best support Harvard can give them.
On a similar note, the administration must prioritize supporting “dreamers”: students enrolled in the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrival, or DACA, program. It is currently unclear whether students on DACA will be able to benefit from the government’s relief bill payout. Under Trump, they couldn’t. Harvard should use its lobbying prowess to push the Biden administration to ensure they can. Should the White House side against DACA recipients again, our university must step in to support them instead with its own funds to accommodate the government’s failure.
Our community isn’t a monolithic, ultra-wealthy whole in no need of assistance. For both workers and students, additional institutional help could prove radically beneficial. This makes stimulus funds well worthy of acceptance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Margaret P. “Maggie” McCarthy ’22-’23 said she had not yet checked her email when she noticed the group chat with her Harvard basketball teammates was blowing up.
“I actually just received a text in my group chat on my team, and girls were excited. I was like, ‘What’s all this excitement about?’” she said. “They told me to check my email so I checked and, even though I kind of expected in the back of my mind, there was a huge surge of excitement.”
Many students reacted with elation to Monday’s announcement that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is “expecting a full return to campus” and a return to “in-person learning” for the fall 2021 semester.
Jay T. Driver ’24 said he was thrilled to “finally get some good news” after a year marred by disappointing announcements from Harvard.
“This is really good news to finally see a light at the end of the tunnel and know that, hopefully by next fall, we’ll all be able to be there and have things be back to normal,” he said.
Some students said they were surprised by the timing and tone of Harvard’s announcement.
Shreya P. Nair ’24 said she was surprised that Harvard administrators decided to share fall plans before the end of the spring semester.
“We weren’t expecting an announcement to come before the summer, in general, because we’ve known Harvard to be pretty conservative in terms of estimating with Covid,” Nair said. “It was a surprise, but a welcome one.”
Nair said she and her friends have already begun planning for their reunion on campus this fall.
“The small interactions that we’ll be able to have again — running into people in between classes, in-person labs — I’m definitely looking forward to,” Nair said. “We’re excited to see the buildings and be on a historic campus, and have all those first-year experiences, albeit a little bit delayed.”
Jacob A. Heberle ’22 said he was “pleasantly surprised” by Harvard’s expectations for the fall, noting Harvard’s restrictions on residential life throughout the past year.
“It’s still a surprise because Harvard, I think, has had one of the most conservative responses to Covid of all the schools,” Heberle said. “The fact that it seems that they’re going ahead with a return to normal things in the fall is actually quite a surprise.”
Casey D. Dornbach ’22 said he had been hoping Harvard would bring him and his classmates back to campus next semester.
“I was optimistic, but you never know until those decisions are made,” he said. “So it was definitely a relief to get that notice today.”
Dornbach, a member of Harvard’s men’s ice hockey team, said he is excited to return to campus with the prospect of competing on the ice once again.
“I have another year of eligibility next year,” he said. “It happens to be senior year, and I can go back with my closest friends and teammates and classmates and have one more great year back on campus.”
Harvard Director of Athletics Erin McDermott said in a February interview that she believes an Ivy League fall season is “pretty assured.”
Driver, a freshman who spent his first semester on campus, said he is looking forward to meeting upperclassmen.
“I got quadded, but I’m not mad about it,” he said. “I’m actually really excited to meet everybody who’s around me there and, obviously, I think everybody will be in a good mood because everybody will be really happy to be back together.”
“I feel like I’m going to have a second freshman year,” he added.
Sophia N. Fend ’24, who is living on campus this year, said though she is excited, she is nervous to get a more “typical college experience” this fall.
“I know where nothing is. I haven’t had an in-person college class at all — kind of don’t know what to expect,” Fend said. “Everyone has that to a certain extent just because we’ve been online for so long.”
Heberle said he is thankful he will likely spend his senior year on campus.
“I don’t know what I would have done had they decided not to do things as normal,” he said. “I don’t want another semester lost in my time at Harvard.”
Though Heberle noted that the FAS’s plans are not yet definitive, Monday’s announcement was reassuring.
“We shouldn’t pack our bags already, book our tickets already until we know for certain that this is how things are going to go,” Heberle said. “Regardless, I think today everyone at Harvard is going to go to bed a little bit happier than they were yesterday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is “expecting a full return to campus” and a return to “in-person learning” for College students in fall 2021, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced Monday.
Harvard will announce finalized fall 2021 plans in late May, according to Gay’s emailed announcement to FAS affiliates.
“Though final decisions will not be available until late May, we are currently expecting a full return to campus in Fall 2021 and our planning is focused entirely on how to restart all campus-based activities safely,” Gay wrote.
In late May, Harvard will provide affiliates with further information on fall planning, including “re-entry protocols to housing, public health protocols to financial aid, and more.”
Gay wrote that Harvard is planning to provide “regular, full density” on-campus housing as well as additional accommodations in off-campus “Harvard-affiliated housing” if necessary.
“Contingency planning is underway to enable this residential return even if reduced density is required,” she added.
“Our goal is to ensure that every student who wants Harvard housing will be able to live in Harvard-affiliated housing,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in a follow-up email Monday to College students.
Gay wrote that she anticipates all College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students will be able to take in-person classes in the fall. Faculty, teaching fellows, and “other instructional staff” will teach on campus. University administrators announced earlier Monday that it plans to allow all faculty and staff to return to work in person Aug. 2.
“Should public health conditions necessitate adaptations to in-person instruction this fall, we will be prepared to support course staff in teaching safely, including limited teaching in other modalities, informed by the lessons learned from our spring hybrid teaching pilots,” Gay wrote.
Gay added that the FAS expects to offer a “full range” of in-person academic resources this fall, including through Harvard’s libraries, archives, museums, and research facilities.
Gay also addressed international students specifically in her announcement.
She wrote that international students “should confidently apply for visas knowing [Harvard] will offer in-person instruction.” The College and GSAS will support international students in their efforts to come to campus, she added.
Since Harvard only offered remote courses this academic year, federal visa restrictions barred international freshmen from coming to Harvard’s campus.
“We are eager to welcome our international students back to campus, but we also recognize that they may face particular hurdles,” she wrote. “We recognize that some students may confront delays in visa processing that impact their ability to come to campus and the College and GSAS will work directly with these students to help them navigate their program options.”
Khurana wrote in his email that Harvard Summer School will release an announcement regarding on-campus housing availability in mid-April. All students who studied away from campus for the entire academic year are eligible to live on campus and take two free courses at the Summer School, Harvard previously announced.
