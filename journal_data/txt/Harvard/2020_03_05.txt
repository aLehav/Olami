Over a decade after the first episode of the series aired, and after years of questioning whether the beloved series would reach a conclusion, fans have finally been blessed with the staggered release of the final season of “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” on Disney+. Releasing as if it were on traditional television, the 12-episode season concludes the intimate story portrayed throughout the series while tying into the beginning of “Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith.” Even after almost a decade of waiting, the show manages to maintain its style, deliver on its story, and give fans what they want: more in-depth chronicles of the struggles during the Clone Wars Era.
Typical of the critically-acclaimed show, creators Dave Filoni, Henry Gilroy, and George Lucas focus on all aspects of the expansive Star Wars universe. Episodes dive into the diplomacy of the galaxy-spanning war and the trials faced by the Jedi while highlighting the lives of individual clone troopers — an insight not shown in any of the live action films.
The episode begins with Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter) and Mace Windu (Terrence ‘T.C.’ Carson) strategizing after a series of staggering losses on Anaxes, the Republic’s primary shipyard. Deeming a covert mission necessary, Skywalker and Windu call in a cavalry composed of several individual clones (all of whom are voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) including Captain Rex, Commander Cody, ARC trooper Jesse, a Clone medic, and a squad known as Clone Force 99. Named to pay homage to the deceased Clone 99, this atypical Clone group carries out what most other Clone units would consider suicide missions with perfect success. Led by Sergeant Hunter, a master tracker and hand-to-hand combat specialist, the Bad Bunch also includes Wrecker, Crosshair, and Tech, all named for their unique and necessary skills.
Throughout this episode, the struggles of these Clones become clear in the midst of a never ending war. For years, Captain Rex sees friends die during heated battles and difficult confrontations with the Sith. Reflecting with him on the pains of war, Commander Cody states, “Sometimes in war, it’s hard to be the one that survives.” Doing what few other TV shows can do, “The Clone Wars” addresses the danger of war from all sides. In other episodes, the Jedi struggle as peacekeepers leading the war effort. Diplomats are shut down by assassination attempts and subterfuge. Clones watch their friends die, all the while understanding that they wouldn’t even be alive without the necessity of war. Through an approachable, enjoyable medium, “The Clone Wars” appeals to audiences of all ages while still delivering these kinds of meaningful messages and deliberate conversations.
“Star Wars: The Clone Wars” is a show like few others in its combination of wide-reaching viewership, consistently positive reviews, and diverse episode topics. Once again, Lucas and his team of creators promise to deliver a visually appealing, entertaining, and original show within one of the most-loved science fiction story arcs ever created. This particular episode lacks some of the theatrics and excitement of others, but nevertheless demonstrates that the beloved stories are back. The remaining 11 episodes will conclude the Clone Force 99 story and address many more, with new episodes of Season Seven of “The Clone Wars” releasing every Friday until the 12-episode final season reaches its conclusion on May 8 of this year.

It seems like every day we hear about another epic celebrity clapback. Whether Chrissy Teigen is owning a troll in her Instagram comments, an actor is calling out a news outlet for spreading false rumours, or two celebrities are feuding on Twitter, the internet keeps us well fed with the dramatic, pithy replies of the insulted ultra-famous. This week’s incident falls into the last category: the infamous inter-celebrity beef.
On Feb. 23, controversial YouTuber Jake Paul took a shot at former One Direction band member Zayn Malik. Paul wrote on Twitter that he “almost had to clap up zane from 1 direction because he is a little guy and has an attitude.” He continued, chiding Malik to “stop being angry cause u came home alone to ur big ass hotel room hahaha.”
At that point, the exchange may have simply seemed like a run of the mill celebrity mudsling. But then Malik’s on-again off-again girlfriend, supermodel Gigi Hadid, entered into the fray. Hadid deployed a brutal response, writing, “Lol cause he doesn’t care to hang w you and your embarrassing crew of YouTube groupies..? Home alone with his best friends like a respectful king cause he has me, sweetie. Unbothered by your irrelevant ugly ass. Go to bed …”
First of all, many were shocked to know that Malik and Hadid were, in fact, on again. The two young stars’ romantic journey has been nothing if not complicated since rumors first began swirling in late 2015. Hadid went on to co-star in Malik’s steamy music video for his debut single as a solo artist, “Pillow Talk,” and the two attended the 2016 Met Gala together dressed in matching robot-inspired attire. Their latest rekindling was confirmed on Valentine’s Day via Hadid’s secondary Instagram account, “Gi’sposables.” Littered among behind the scenes photos of Hadid’s supermodel friends backstage at a litany of fashion week events, fans of the two were treated to a blurry shot of the singer, squinting into the camera. Hadid playfully captioned the photo “HEY VALENTINE,” and added the description “Z on the Farm ♡ December 2019.” This post not only established that the two were together once more, but also made clear that this reconnection happened at least a few months prior.
While this may seem like a simple, brief tweet in defense of her man, there are several layers to Hadid’s online takedown. First and foremost, it is indicative of the divide between traditional celebrities and the new breed of the so-called “internet famous.” Long perceived as a less influential cohort, the latter has recently experienced more exposure and validation from magazines, television networks, and some award shows. However, there is still a sense of stratification, a schism between the glamorous models, singers, and actors of Hadid’s and Malik’s world, and the recent, boisterous fame of Paul and other online stars.
There is a sense of insecurity in the internet famous, the notion that even those who achieve unfathomable success, including millions of followers and massive incomes, do not have a “real job.” We have long since determined that actors and actresses, singers and fashion models, are all doing some sort of work, even if the pomp and circumstance can seem a bit frivolous to some. But to many, especially older audiences who grew up before the internet became the phenomenon it is today, it seems as if Paul and others like him are simply recording their daily lives and somehow getting paid to do it. Readers can clearly see Hadid playing into this notion as she refers to Paul and his “embarrassing crew of YouTube groupies.”
The idea of his “crew” is also an interesting one. Paul has famously enlisted a group of friends, all less famous than himself, to live with him, promote his merchandise, and generally participate in the shenanigans and hijinks that comprise the majority of his content. By calling his crew “embarrassing,” Hadid is perhaps alluding to Paul and his sidekicks. She is both slyly suggesting that he doesn’t have genuine friends, simply “groupies” attracted to the fame and exposure that he can provide, and highlighting their comparative lack of influence. This jab is especially compelling when one compares Paul’s followers to Hadid’s own friends, all of whom have similarly huge levels of fame, including Taylor Swift, Kendall Jenner, and Gigi’s sister, Bella Hadid. Gigi herself has over 50 million followers on Instagram and Malik has over 30 million, while Paul comes in with a paltry 13 million.
In addition to the dig about those that Paul surrounds himself with, Hadid also responds to the seemingly absurd and largely baseless allegation that any anger on Malik’s part resulted from his “empty hotel room.” Beside the fact that there seems to be no evidence that any altercation resulted from some sort of loneliness on Malik’s part, this claim left Paul wide open to Hadid’s clapback. Here, she weaponizes her own status as a supermodel who is literally known for her good looks. It is no surprise that she added the line, “Home alone with his best friends like a respectful king cause he has me, sweetie.”
Finally, nearing the end of her 280 character limit, Hadid both reiterates Paul’s comparative unimportance, and tells Paul to “Go to bed ...” These last three words, and the poetic ellipses that follow, contain something beautiful in their simplicity. They allude to a sense of immaturity, almost telling Paul to leave the room because the grown ups are talking now. Put all of these elements together, and it is safe to say that she owned him.

The music video for BTS’s “ON” opens with a drone shot of a six by five formation of figures clad in all-black and combat boots, each holding two black sticks. There is not a single BTS member in the frame. The figures’ movements are simple, all angles and lines. Standing in the middle of some open-air concrete compound that looks like a military base, they are a force to be reckoned with.
And then Jimin comes in and breaks all the rules. Not only is he wearing all white, but he is also flexible, lifting and curving all parts of his body at once.
It turns out all of BTS’s members are mischief makers. One by one, they are revealed, clad in white and pulling moves outside of just marching and raising their arms. Eventually, we forget about their army friends.
The camera facilitates this forgetting through its balancing of background and foreground. Almost every time a new BTS formation comes on screen, it is first introduced with a wide shot situating the group in the wider army, then the camera cuts closer into a tighter, shallower shot of BTS, so that the army becomes blurred or blocked. Additionally, the cinematography is careful about how much viewers see of each group. While all of the army’s transitions and formation changes are made transparent, it looks like BTS members are constantly vanishing into and appearing out of thin air, lending them an air of mystery and intrigue that demands our attention. Ultimately, the army acts as a backdrop for BTS. Each of the BTS formations assimilates the others through this milieu of discipline and legibility, localized in the bodies of a unified military-like force. The bodies of the army become a conduit for inter-BTS exchange.
This exchange reaches its climax when, prompted by Jimin’s motioning upward, the camera tilts up. On its way back down, viewers face a sudden vacuum of sound before a raw, trumpet-heavy rhythm sets in and all hell breaks loose. There’s a cut on every beat, and the camera turns and another BTS member or some different triangle formation is suddenly up in viewers’ faces. Going from medium-high drone shots, to tight, flattened shots, to even tighter shots of faces, the camera traverses all manner of distances. It turns, tilts, and maneuvers so the viewer feels like they’re a curveball that’s been hurled at the group. There is not a single moment of rest. The whole scene comes across as a hype goth parade, with the hype coming from both the dancers and the camera. The camera, an active participant in the shot, becomes a competitor for our attention and even detracts from the intensity of the dance. Regardless, there is a case to be made that both their energies combined drives this “kinetic manifesto” to its peak.
And then… we’re back to singing. But it’s different now because the soundlessness of the climax rang so true that now we hear it even when it’s not there. When they all sing together, when all seven of BTS’s voices combine and merge in final scene, it sounds like the trumpets blaring from those 30 seconds. The magic of that scene carries over and through to the end.

Boston Ballet kicked off its spring 2020 season on Feb. 27 with a triple bill of contemporary ballet works by choreographers who, according to Boston Ballet, “epitomize the ever-evolving tradition of dance.” Following the chronological order of their contributions, “rEVOLUTION” features the ever impressive Balanchine’s “Agon” followed by Balanchine’s successor Jerome Robbins’ “Glass Pieces,” and finished off by William Forsythe’s “In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.” The works show off the incredible virtuosity of Boston Ballet’s dancers who, in turn, perfectly capture the revolutionary excitement of these contemporary works.
No program about contemporary ballet would be complete without “Agon,” the quintessential contemporary ballet by the man known as the “father of American ballet.” Boston Ballet treats the classic with due reverence, setting it with its original simplicity — dancers costumed in students’ attire against a solid blue background. This sparsity allows all the focus to be on the demanding technique of the choreography, which the dancers executed with precision and tireless athleticism. Principal Lia Cirio’s incredible flexibility and captivating artistry shine in the pas de deux, as she and her partner Paulo Arrais develop the narrative as well as their relationship with the audience. “Agon” is a ballet that embodies the Picasso quote, “Learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist.” Its intense technique pushes the limits of classical movements and shows the dancers to be the professionals that they are: Experts with the deep understanding of the art necessary to have fun with technique.
After the simplicity of “Agon,” the company offers the complexity of “Glass Pieces”’s defining stained glass jewel tones — again executed to perfection on the Boston Opera House stage. The grid background and colorful costumes customary for the piece are all there, and the dancers perform the chaotic but fun, metropolitan-inspired choreography with grace and poise. The most impressive part of “Glass Pieces,” however, is the strength of Boston Ballet’s male dancers. Tight, controlled jumps and formations showcase their power and technical prowess in the work’s large all male ensemble. The pas de deux is performed with fluid movement quality by second soloist Addie Tapp and principal Patrick Yocum. Tapp’s long limbs unfold across the stage in gorgeous extensions and lifts.
The effect of the busy, endless movement along with the ebb and flow of the dancers onstage is also elevated by the flawless synchronization of the performers. No one misses a beat, even as corps dancers incrementally bob across the stage to the underlying rhythm while the principals move to the stronger, mournful melody. The dancers successfully capture the energy and vitality of the urban environments that this choreography was designed to highlight.
“In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated” closes out the show on a high note with its unmatched intensity. The industrial sounding music startles when it crashes open, setting the tone for the rest of the piece. The intense, hard hitting movements are sharply executed by the dancers with impressive stamina as they maintain a high level of energy throughout the piece. Derek Dunn’s always deft footwork is at its best here with the furious petit allegro. The choreography is again exceedingly technical but the difficult turns and balances are performed with fantastic musicality. The dancers know the difficult music inside and out, perfectly hitting every crash and shriek. Principal Ji Young Chae displays remarkable control, holding her positions and filling out the music through each movement. She performs each heart-stopping pirouette without a wobble. This is Forsythe at its finest, no doubt credited in large part to Boston Ballet’s long partnership with the venerated choreographer, who was called onstage at the end of opening night.
“rEVOLUTION” highlights the strength of the company artists, showcasing their physicality with the demanding choreography of three of the most influential contemporary works of ballet. These pieces may now be part of the repertoire of American ballet, but this production truly elevates the works so they are no less revolutionary than when they were created.

Turn on the television and watch reports on today’s newsworthy stories. Open Twitter and see how people react to them. Go to work and hear about them some more. Come home and, well, there’s family. Laugh with them, rant to them, celebrate with them, comfort them, worry about them. Every day brings something new.
This cycle likely sounds familiar to many people today. It is also the orbit of Lizzie, the narrator in Jenny Offill’s charming new novel, “Weather.” She’s a university librarian whose unusual side job is to answer letters sent to an apocalypse podcast. But there’s nothing unusual about Lizzie’s emotional life. For Lizzie is beset with worry –– about the ups and downs of her marriage, her struggling brother Henry, her country (circa 2016), her planet. Despite these anxieties, she tries to avoid the fretful and immobilizing trepidation to which she responds everyday. While Lizzie’s unease is plentiful, she never allows herself to lose hope entirely.
In a novel that emphasizes this emotional journey more than the storyline itself, Offill finds an ideal space where her unique style is most effective. The book’s pages are alight with Offill’s simple prose, short sentences, and equally concise paragraphs. Indeed, Offill organizes her novel almost entirely in vignettes, at most a couple of pages and at least a couple of lines. Some vignettes offer glimpses of the day-to-day journeys of Lizzie’s life and her interaction with the world around her. Lizzie discusses the increase of automation with Mr. Jimmy, a car-service driver. She’s annoyed with Mrs. Kovinski, her politically opposite neighbor. She’s disappointed by the “able-bodied teenagers with earbuds” who occupy the priority seats on a full bus. While these little moments may seem like fragmented references to the times, they certainly do not come off that way. Flowing one into the other, each vignette cleverly discusses an experience familiar to many and envisions another person’s reaction to it.
Added to these kinds of vignettes are longer ones that deal with Lizzie’s less fleeting interactions with her family. At the emotional root of the novel lie Lizzie’s dual and sometimes conflicting commitments. On the one hand, there’s her husband Ben and son Eli; on the other, her troubled brother Henry. Offill provides a powerful sense of love’s magnetic pull, and of the forceful strain that ensues when the all-consuming duty of love spreads one too thin. The reader gets a sense of Lizzie’s worry when her intense focus on Henry seems to push her classics-loving husband, Ben, away. “You’re weary of me, aren’t you?” Lizzie asks at one point. As her marriage lies in a kind of cold stagnation, Lizzie’s resolute devotion to Henry is palpable in a particularly vivid passage: “But how can I leave him alone? Already, I’m hiding my sleeping pills in a sock under my bed.”
The emotional journey of family, while beautifully rendered, is not without its shortcomings. Perhaps the lone weakness of the novel is that the reader does not get as much of an insight into Ben or Eli as they do Henry. With Henry, Offill paints a vivid image of his relationship with Lizzie. She shows the reader his struggles and concerns and vulnerabilities along with Lizzie’s reactions and responses to them. This is effective because what Lizzie “sees” –– in addition to what she thinks –– rises to the surface of the page, creating a fuller understanding of her relationship with Henry. Only occasionally does the reader feel similarly with Ben, and even more scarcely with Eli. To be sure, their relationships with Lizzie are well-conceived, but they do not reach the intensity with which one experiences Lizzie’s relationship with Henry.
“Weather” would not succeed without the countless aphorisms and other witty, sometimes satirical, statements interspersed between these vignettes. In some ways, these are some of the most delightful and original elements of the novel –– they evoke the sayings that one could find in tiny pocketbooks and capture Offill’s literary voice and expressive prose. Offill quotes from a diverse cast, from Virginia Woolf to Sri Ramakrishna, and also adds many maxims of her own. “There is a period after every disaster in which people wander around trying to figure out if it is truly a disaster,” Lizzie observes at one point. In a more lighthearted one, a friend caricatures Silicon Valley: “These people long for immortality but can’t wait ten minutes for a cup of coffee.” These observations enhance Offill’s novel by serving as her most diverse literary tool: They add levity, drive home a point, and inject Offill’s voice and commentary.
“What happened to the flying dreams?” Lizzie asks early on. In a way, this is very much the question Offill poses and explores in her novel, too. Travelling from the mundane to the philosophical, the serious to the whimsical, “Weather” reflects on the times and its effect on those who live in it. Offill discusses the most basic source of joy or pain –– family –– and the most recent –– culture, politics, a changing world. Her sharp prose and structured storytelling shape this commentary on unease, change, and hope into a refreshing literary work.

Throughout its ten year run, “How I Met Your Mother” defined the early 2000s sitcom scene as much as “Friends” defined the ‘90s. Fans fell in love with the dramatic and comical (if a little convoluted) story Ted Mosby tells his kids about his romantic exploits and disasters, leading up to when he meets their mother.
When the final season aired in 2014, fans waited eagerly for the reveal of Ted’s true love. After nine seasons, Ted finally meets Tracy McConnell, his future wife and mother of his two children. However, in the series finale, Ted finishes his story and reveals that Tracy passed away six years prior, and with his children’s permission, he pursues his true love: Robin Scherbatsky.
The conclusion of the series angered many fans, so much so that a petition in 2014 led the creators to include an “alternate ending” in the Season Nine DVD set, one where Ted went on to have a happy, lasting marriage with Tracy.
While this alternate ending lives up to the show’s name, that’s all it does. The original finale, which concludes with Ted standing in front of Robin’s apartment, holding the infamous blue French horn, is the ultimate catharsis and culmination of the show’s nine turbulent seasons. Ted’s own children point out that the entire story began with Ted meeting Robin, and they’re right—the entire narrative is pushed forward by Ted’s complicated feelings for her throughout his life. It is only fitting that the story begins with a young, naive, hopeful Ted stealing a blue French horn for a girl he just met and ends with a matured, reflective, but still optimistically hopeful Ted stealing the same blue French horn for the girl who has seen him through everything.
Many fans felt cheated by the early death of the mother because the show’s premise revolves around Ted’s explanation of how he meets her. Yet the original ending captures the central message of the show: Ted cannot control his romantic fate, no matter how he frames it, for it is truly about “right place, right time.” The show focuses more on Ted’s personal journey, from his intense desire to settle down to his disastrous hook-ups to his failed engagement, and it constantly reiterates that there is no single path or answer. Ted must surrender control and let the universe run its course. The original finale cements this message and truly comes full circle — suggesting that everything leads back to Robin, Ted’s true love. The series finale of HIMYM is the pinnacle of the show’s central message and, by ending where it all began, confirms that Ted’s true destiny is to be with Robin.

Warning: This piece includes spoilers from “Stranger Things” Season Three.
“Stranger Things” is back, and it has not come back quietly. On Feb. 14, a surprising new trailer dropped for the next season of the Netflix original series “Stranger Things,” and with fans around the world weighing in with their opinions on its content, it’s time to break down what exactly the trailer means for the series going forward.
Last year, Season Three ended with an emotional sendoff for one of the show’s most important and beloved characters. In the season’s climax, the protagonists fought off the newest incarnation of upside-down terror while Joyce and Hopper tried to shut down a dangerous Russian experiment aiming to break into the upside-down. Amid the chaos and destruction, it is heavily implied that Hopper sacrificed himself to shut down the Russian experiment. In the aftermath, the show delivered one of the most emotional moments in its history when Eleven read a heartfelt letter from Hopper, who had become a father figure in her life. The letter reads like a goodbye, and it was surprisingly emotional despite the fact that Hopper had written it while trying to explain his anxieties over Eleven’s first romantic relationship. In any case, the letter left audiences tearful as the group of young protagonists split up. Eleven joined the Byers family in their departure from both Hawkins and the pain they had experienced there.
The new trailer, however, exposes a crucial piece of information. In only 50 seconds, the trailer reveals that Hopper is, in fact, still alive and appears to be living as a Russian prisoner. Oh, and he’s bald now too. The finale of Season Three alluded to his potential survival when a Russian prison guard revealed that they were holding a captive American prisoner. Although it’s too early to say how this revelation will affect Season Four, it’s hard to accept that this discovery, which mitigates the emotional effects of the Season Three finale, would be thrown into the trailer as a mere marketing tactic. Perhaps the status of Hopper’s vitality won’t be a major plot point in Season Four, but regardless, the show needs to handle this reintroduction carefully — after all, his “death” was a major turning point for Eleven and the rest of the group.
The trailer doesn’t clue audiences into much more than Hopper’s survival and the fact that the Russian storyline will probably be getting more attention in Season Four. Fans will have to wait for a more expansive and informative trailer to drop. In the meantime, however, “Stranger Things” devotees can look forward to the return of a beloved character.

One year ago from this month, Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow visited China and gave a speech at Peking University that earned him my respect and made me proud of Harvard. His speech shone through with the Harvard spirit — the pursuit of truth through valuing the power of knowledge, encouraging cooperation and dialogue between countries, peoples, and cultures, and respecting diversity to elevate the human spirit and the condition of all mankind. In particular, Bacow’s reading of Abdurehim Ötkür’s poem about the search for truth moved me to tears. I felt proud that my beloved Uighur poet and Harvard University’s President shared the same spirit of intellectual exploration.
Ötkür was a beloved and iconic Uighur writer and poet. I studied his poems and prose in our Uighur language textbooks when I was a high school student. In the 1990s, I attended the same university in Urumqi that he had attended in the 1940s.
For people who don’t know about the Uighurs, Bacow’s gesture may seem like nothing. But it is a great moral support for us, a people with a unique culture and colorful history whose ancestors established empires and contributed significantly to the building and development of the Silk Road but are now marginalized in today’s China.
Millions of Uighurs, who are Chinese citizens, are suffering through unimaginable, incomprehensible cruelty and heartbreaking, unforgettable tragedy. They have been separated from their family members and taken to so-called “re-education” centers. They are under constant Chinese state surveillance. And in all aspects of life on a daily basis, they are discriminated against.
As an American citizen of Uighur origin living freely in this country, I was saddened by the fate of millions of my fellow people in their own country. I could not fathom the arrests or disappearances of many lovely people like Professor Rahile Dawut, literary critic Yalqun Rozi, and others whom I know very well. These are the scholars who have contributed to the progress of Uighur society and played the role of a bridge between different cultures and peoples, between the Uighurs and the Chinese government. China’s attack on them and so many others certainly is a great tangible loss for Uighur people. It is also an intangible loss for China and Chinese people.
While watching this tragedy from afar, unable to stop China’s cruelty, Uighurs abroad felt helpless and hopeless. But we believed in humanity, and expected some kind of just and unified response from all countries and international organizations that would change China’s behavior. After all, contemporary China has thrived after it opened its door to the world.
Unfortunately, many countries and major international organizations stayed silent on the plight of Uighurs. One hypothesis is that their eyes were on Aladdin’s almighty lamp that says “made in China.” But in such a time when those with power and fame chose to stay silent or indifferent, President Bacow stood up for justice and subtly expressed his concern for the fate of millions of Uighurs through reading that poem by Ötkür. More concretely, Harvard also recently hired a full-time preceptor to teach the Uighur language. Without a doubt, Harvard under the leadership of President Bacow splashed water on a withering flower, and I trust that it will blossom one day.
President Bacow did not just stand up for Uighurs. Most importantly he stood up for the truth — the truth that everyone strives to live the life they would like to live as free people with many choices. But doing so has never been easy. Too often, unfortunately, when one segment of mankind gets their liberty, another segment of mankind falls into misery. When mankind makes progress in one field, it regresses in another field. This causes an unequal distribution of choices for mankind that often makes freedom too skewed.
I am proud that Harvard’s truth-seeking community never ceases to fight for the progress and betterment of all mankind. And the Harvard community never hesitates to express its concern against injustices and oppression, wherever they are. I saw this in both President Bacow’s speech and deeds. I have also seen this in a recent Crimson op-ed that brought attention to the Uighur people’s misery. Young people like the op-ed’s author, Guillermo S. Hava, are an embodiment of this spirit and give me hope that our youth will do more good for the future of mankind to create a peaceful, prosperous, free, and just world shared by everyone.
Whenever there is an honest exploration for the truth, done with friendly collaboration and honest dialogue, the Harvard spirit sparkles. And with this same spirit, I urge the Harvard community to remind the Chinese government that respecting Uighurs’ human rights, treating them benignly, and letting them live the way they want to live is the best cure to this conflict.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, I wrote about the importance of prices as a regulation of consumption in times when goods are in short supply. Back then, I was simply making the case that for markets, in which prices are allowed to rise naturally, individuals are much less likely to hoard scarce resources. Now, we’re actually seeing this type of hoarding in action — of everything from hand sanitizer to toilet paper to face masks, in places ranging from Georgia to France to Hong Kong. Even in our own backyard, the problem persists. When I visited CVS in Harvard Square Wednesday morning, they were out of both hand sanitizer and masks. Indeed, the seemingly irrational unwillingness of many sellers to raise prices of face masks has led to concerns that the doctors who need masks most may not be able to secure enough of them.
The coronavirus is, after all, one of those events that leaves us feeling a sense of almost complete powerlessness: a disease that is essentially an invisible enemy. Each day, CNN and the New York Times tell us about new appearances of the virus. In January, we knew it was in Asia, as cases migrated from China to Korea and Japan. Then it popped up in France and Italy. Suddenly Iran had it too. The international spread had begun. Now, health officials say that the United States is on the eve of an outbreak, and that this is almost certainly a pandemic.
So what should we really expect? Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health, is making projections that 40 to 70 percent of the world will be infected by the virus, given the length of the vaccine development process. The World Health Organization pegs the eventual fatality rate between 1 to 2 percent; the CDC says it may be lower than 1 percent. In a world of 7 billion, even if we take the most conservative estimates of these numbers, the back-of-the-envelope math generates a death toll well in the millions. Now, we could cast doubt on a Harvard epidemiology professor and say he should do some robustness checks on his model (for our own sanity), but then again, most of us can’t pretend to be epidemiologists ourselves. Humor me and let’s assume that these experts have a point; if they’re right, we could be facing a really seismic event unprecedented in our lifetimes.
This brings me to the point. Most of us are pretty myopic when it comes to history; we tend to forget how recently the United States faced pandemics that actually inflicted damage on the scale of the worst-case projections for this virus. In 1957, the “Asian Flu” led to an estimated 1 to 2 million deaths worldwide, including more than 116,000 deaths in the United States. In 1968, the “Hong Kong flu” led to more than 100,000 American deaths.
I would wager that 99 percent of Harvard students have never heard of either outbreak. 1957 might bring to mind the Sputnik launch or the Little Rock Nine; 1968 is, in most of our minds, the year of Vietnam and the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Indeed, the Smithsonian’s summary of major American events of 1968 doesn’t even mention the flu that killed more Americans than the entire war in Vietnam.
Our natural response may be: “but surely we aren’t living in 1968 anymore.” How can health officials in the 21st century tell us that the only preventive measure at our disposal is washing our hands more carefully? We automatically expect medical advances to prevent deaths of this scale from happening today. Perhaps they will. Certainly, researchers are working around the clock on vaccines (for those who don’t get the virus first). But for cases of people who already have it, active quarantine measures appear to be the best way to slow its spread.
It’s poetic in a way — that some techniques of the 14th century still must be used today. In a world with space shuttles, self-driving cars and high-frequency trading, that’s the best we can do at the moment. This doesn’t mean we should accept mediocrity in the long run; that would be unacceptable in a field as important as public health. But you fight the war with the army you have, not with the army you wish to have. In any case, such situations demand from us a degree of humility, and serve as reminders that humans are still — partially — enslaved to fate.
In any case, the whole virus could blow over, so this article may not age well. But if it doesn’t go away, we may face an event of a magnitude that no longer exists in our collective memory and yet happened not so long ago. After all, history repeats when history itself is forgotten.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, The Crimson reported that one in four Class of 2020 varsity athletes quit during their time at the College. The report prompted responses from Harry R. Lewis ’68, a former Dean of Harvard College, who argued that “Ivy League athletics is premised on the freedom of athletes, like other Harvard students, to rethink their interests and commitments,” and from Harvard Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise, who described a student athlete’s decision to stop or continue playing a sport as akin to a student changing their concentration.
We wholeheartedly agree with Lewis and Scalise’s reasoning. Harvard’s athletes are students just like any of us. Accordingly, they deserve the right to decide, as members of our community, what their participation in student life will look like.
We affirm our belief that student-athletes, as individuals with unique experiences and mentalities borne from having dedicated themselves to a high level of athletic excellence, have an important, valuable role at Harvard. Their athletic talents, experience, and intellect diversify Harvard, just as other students’ academic, extracurricular or personal experiences enrich our school community.
This understanding of the role of student-athletes, we believe, clarifies that the athlete admissions process should prioritize considerations of how recruited athletes will contribute to campus in their role as students first and foremost. In other words, student-athletes should be evaluated in the same way the admissions office evaluates other students: not merely in terms of their athletic capabilities, but holistically on how the sum of their characteristics, athletic and otherwise, will enrich our community. In fact, Lewis and Scalise’s defense of athletes who walk off their teams cannot, it seems, cohere with an admissions system that treats athletes preferentially.
In recognizing the rightful place student-athletes have in the broader Harvard community, we hope and expect that student-athletes engage academically, socially, and extracurricularly outside of their teams, and, at the same time, that the student body engages with the wide range of talented athletes Harvard has attracted. Since 2015, our varsity teams have won 54 Ivy League Championships and their successes have, unfortunately, not been celebrated or recognized widely enough across the river. These successes should be the collective pride of our campus, and any social fragmentation that exists at the College along athlete/non-athlete lines must be viewed as the shared responsibility of our entire community. We pride our school for its diversity, and as such, we should collectively aim — on all sides — to celebrate a diverse array of student achievements.
A 25 percent athletic attrition rate is not inherently bad. That being said, the athletic department should be cognizant of the environment and culture within teams and support their athletes as they try to navigate their dual roles at Harvard. The time-consuming nature of varsity athletics requires student-athletes to strike a careful balancing act while on campus, and we think it behooves the athletic department to work towards a better understanding of why student-athletes choose to exit, lest the explanations point to trends worth disrupting. It is more than reasonable for students to change passions, but it is also possible for an unsustainably demanding environment to extinguish such passion.
Lastly, we appreciate that Harvard athletics gives student-athletes the freedom to leave their sports as they embark on their journeys through Harvard. Student-athletes should not feel boxed into their athlete roles and, like any other students, should be encouraged to explore diverse social groups, intellectual passions, and other extracurriculars. They are far more than means for our University to do well in a league, and we commend the athletic department for recognizing the value of their athletes and being supportive of their broader, and potentially shifting, interests.

Mrs. Buxton adjusts her horn-rimmed glasses and squints at the attendance sheet.
“See-zee?” she calls. She is met with silence. Her kindergarteners fidget on the rug and regard her warily.
She tries again, this time extending a red manicured nail to underline the word. “Shi-jee? Si-zee?”
The word catches in her throat, grating her teeth like sandpaper, and only then do I realize she is calling my name.
I put my hand up. “That’s me. It’s Sizhe. Like Si-juh.”
I hear hastily stifled giggles and feel my cheeks flush with shame as the class turns towards me. I am suddenly aware that I have labeled myself as different from the Sarahs and the Charlottes and the Emilys — that I have labeled myself wrongly.
Mrs. Buxton raises her eyebrows and purses her lips.
“Is there something else we can call you, sweetie?”
***
I do not know the name of the man who named me.
Sizhe was suggested by my parents’ grad school pharmacology professor, whom they deeply admired but I cannot remember meeting. Presumably, though, he had high hopes for me — si is the Mandarin verb for “think,” and zhe means “wise.” As my mom explains, he wanted me to develop a passion for science and a drive to explore the world.
Unfortunately, these good intentions are washed away by the Pacific when we move from Wuhan to Salt Lake City. At the age of five, I am the only non-white student in my class and unable to help my teachers and friends properly pronounce my name. My parents, at the advice of their coworkers, decide I should have an alternative American name to use at school — just to make life easier.
Sophia comes from a dictionary we thumb through at Barnes & Noble, in an appendix listing common English names and their meanings. Its resemblance to my Chinese name immediately seems obvious — it means “wisdom” in Greek, and it too starts with the letter S. That’s good enough for us, and the following week, I board the school bus with light-up Skechers, two pigtails, and a new name.
***
After Sizhe turns into Sophia, qianbi turns into pencil and pengyou into friend. Starting school means relearning how to read, replacing pinyin tones with soft Gs and silent Es. Where Mandarin is sharp and precise, English enchants me with its roundness and fullness and excess. I love listening to my teacher’s flowery voice, her words gliding up into a musical lilt — murmur, follow, quiver. I delight in putting my tongue between my teeth and blowing out, practicing my “th” sound again and again — thud, thorn, thimble. I fill my workbooks with neat letters that I sound out as I go, savoring each one as it sits in my mouth and melts like dark chocolate.
I help my parents navigate supermarkets, paperwork, and phone calls. Each time I am able to translate a phrase or demonstrate how to pronounce a word, I beam with confidence and joy. At home, my new knowledge mixes with my Mandarin-speaking household to create a language of its own. When my mom asks me what I want for dinner, I ask for jiaozi, dumplings — or, as I now call them with a giggle, jiao-lings. These portmanteaus are fun, and soon I have given everything in the house a new name.
My birthday cake has a thick layer of buttercream, delicate frosting roses, and “Happy Birthday Sophia” written in pink icing across the top. I examine my name in curly script, watching the flickering candlelight dance across the loops, listening to the vowels fill the room with melody as guests begin to sing. Sophia… Sophia… Sophia. I close my eyes, blow out six dripping candles, and make a wish.
***
By fourth or fifth grade, I have grown tired of being Sizhe.
I have witnessed all the discomfort my name brings to others — I’ve seen the grimaces, received the flustered apologies, and heard every permutation of the five letters, including one substitute teacher who called me “seizure.” With every awkward pause in the roll call at the start of the school year, I feel the tension rise as eyes wander my way. I am back in Mrs. Buxton’s class again, five years old and singled out.
When I anticipate my name coming up, I jump in hastily — “I go by Sophia.” Immediately, the furrowed eyebrows unravel; the lemon-puckered lips turn into a grateful smile; Sizhe is never mentioned again.
My American name was designed to overcome a language barrier, and it does its job well. Sophia was born out of necessity. Yet the more I introduce her, the more strongly I suspect that to the people around me, she is not only more familiar but also more normal. And there is nothing I want more than to just be normal.
Sophia speaks and writes in perfect English; even better, she composes creative nonfiction for fun and discusses “Wuthering Heights” at length. She spends enough time on math to do well in school but not so much as to become a stereotype. She quits piano, swimming, and Chinese school and takes up Latin, French, and journalism. Alas, there are some things she can’t control — a weird legal name, her dad’s heavy accent, the dumplings her mom packs in her lunch — but those are imposed on her, not who she really is. Sophia is like most everybody else in her suburban New Jersey town, and I cling onto her for dear life.
***
Year by year, Sizhe fades further into the background. My parents, and occasionally the staticky voices of relatives calling from Wuhan, are the only ones who use this name. Sophia is scribbled on the top of my homework, cheered by my teammates during tennis matches, and engraved on my bracelets and keychains.
On official documents that require my legal name, I still write “Sizhe (Sophia) Liang,” a convention I picked up in elementary school. However, I am increasingly irritated by the parentheses. They suggest that there is something to qualify, like I’m interrupting myself with every introduction. This is who I am (but here’s a more palatable version). I come from somewhere different (but don’t worry, I’ve turned into one of you).
In junior year of high school, I become naturalized as a U.S. citizen, and I am presented with the opportunity to legally change my name to Sophia. I want to do it, in large part because it just seems natural; I think of myself as Sophia. But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t also read the studies showing that people with distinctively ethnic names tend to get their resumes overlooked by employers — if I said I didn’t consider how Sizhe would look at the top of my college applications or posted on my dorm room door. When my parents ask that I keep Sizhe as my middle name, I accept it as a fair compromise, and I make the change.
The court order arrives with a gold seal and blue stamp from the Superior Court of New Jersey: “IT IS on this 5th day of March, 2018, ORDERED and ADJUDGED that Sizhe Liang… hereby is authorized to assume the name Sophia Sizhe Liang.” Panic sets in the moment I see it. It had seemed an obvious choice to make at the time — trivial, even — but now I fear that I have betrayed some part of myself, cheapened my identity through the process of assimilation.
What does it mean, I wonder, to permanently adopt a name constructed for everyone else’s convenience?
***
The summer after I graduate from high school, my dad and I fly back to China to visit his brother in his rural hometown in Henan province.
In the dark, quiet hum of the plane ride, I recall an interaction I’d had just a few weeks prior, when I’d told a classmate that I was born in Wuhan. “Woah, I didn’t know you were like, Chinese Chinese,” he said. I chuckled without having the heart to tell him that I didn’t know either.
My uncle leads us up a parched dirt path lined with yellow grass and broken glass. The Liang family cemetery sits at the top of a small hill, generations of my ancestors buried together under wildflowers and pebbles. We burn incense, food, and gold foil to send to them. It is the first time I see my dad cry. As the offerings soften and crumple in the flames, they seem to ripple with a life of their own. I watch the ashes drift in the wind and fall into the soil. It’s comforting to know that although Sizhe has already been changed, the other half of my Chinese name, Liang, will always remain here, in the earth.
We have jiaozi for dinner that night, and I think back to the funny language mixtures of my childhood.
I think of jiao-lings and supermarket translations, of the pharmacology professor and the dictionary of names, of a Harvard acceptance letter brought back to aunties and uncles bursting with pride.
I think of a girl who has her feet planted on the hill of her family’s legacy; her head floating in English novels and Cambridge dreams; and, somewhere in between, her heart filled with all the wisdom of two worlds combined.
Amongst all these portmanteaus, there is room for one more: Sophia Sizhe Liang.

If you’ve ever tried to make an HUHS appointment, you know my struggle. If you haven’t, I live in envy of your pastoral bliss. I picture you, a freshman starting your second semester, thinking you’ve made it through your first year unscathed by mono or a trip to Mt. Auburn. You’re in the peak of youth and vigor, laughing and playing cards around a table filled with fresh-faced friends.
Your search history is clear of the HUHS “patient portal,” and your mind is filled with idyllic notions about the attentive care you would receive were you to fall ill. I, on the other hand, disillusioned and embittered as my shriveled hands type this, have seen the infamous screen come and go.
I am talking about that terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad screen. A sight you will one day know when you finally contract strep throat from the shot glass you shared with your five blockmates in Lev Tower on the night before Housing Day (and for Leverett House? Really?). It’s the screen that informs the intrepid HUHS visit-seeker: “In few words, let us know your concern.”
When I first stumbled upon this message so long ago, it left me awash with ideas for a concise yet vivid retelling of the physical and emotional journey that led me to the once-shining gates of the “patient portal.”
However, my HUHS Hoopes Prize ambitions were cut short by fine print which informed me of a “[30 char limit].” Naïve and unsuspecting, I was sure there had been some sort of mistake: Surely they meant 30 words? Alas, I began to type “I guess it all started when I was eigh-” I stopped, confused as I repeatedly pressed the “t” key, before looking down and gazing at my fate.
There, beneath the text box was a character counter, informing me that four letters into the age when it all started was where my HUHS story ended. I was flustered, befuddled, and frustrated, but most of all, I felt a civic duty to get the word out about the word count and help my peers surpass its limitations.
So here, I present to you a short collection I have entitled “30 characters or less for HUHS.”

If University President Lawrence S. Bacow were to watch the videos that Joshua Y. Chiang’s ’22 posts on TikTok, Chiang believes his reaction would probably be “negative.” After all, one of Chiang’s followers on the app has called him “the CEO of exposing Harvard.”
Chiang — who has garnered more than 86 thousand followers on the app — first went viral after he posted a video showing that the colored Luxembourg chairs in Harvard Yard cost $762.00 each.
If you happen to be uncultured (or a boomer), TikTok is an app that hosts a smörgåsbord of short videos, each only 15 to 60 seconds long. It is best known for clips of users mimicking viral dance challenges, made possible by TikTok’s large library of songs and widespread following.
But TikTok is home to much more content than just dance videos. A number of Harvard students have found a home on the app, including Chiang. His videos are an eclectic portrayal of Harvard life, from exclusive community dinners in Eliot, to day-in-the-life vlogs, to videos explaining every student’s unspoken desire to get hit by the Quad Shuttle in order to not pay tuition.
Chiang’s content highlights some of the more comical ways Harvard chooses to spend its endowment: Specifically, Chiang has garnered followers by creating videos about the vast selection of off-brand cereal in the dining halls and the mold that was growing in his dorm room in Eliot House.
Asked why he made these videos, Chiang says, “I think I only do that because I, myself, have been slightly disappointed [with the living conditions at Harvard]. Because it’s like, you come to one of the best universities in the world, and there is mold in my room or the washing machines don’t work and I can’t do my laundry.”
Describing his video-making process, Chiang says, “What has been doing well, I try to mimic.” He admits that “sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.”
***
The normally-upbeat tone of most TikTok content belies the stress and demanding requirements of being an influencer, Chiang says.
He has recently decided to post videos less often. “When I posted random, boring, or uninteresting stuff, I noticed that people will unfollow me. And that’s also another stressful aspect,” he says. “What am I doing wrong? Why are people unfollowing me?”
In the beginning of his career, Chiang considered quitting the app because of the stress of constantly checking on the performance of his videos. Even now, he considers quitting, questioning whether TikTok is worth the impact on his mental health — he explains that he was recently surpassed in followers by two other TikTokers at Harvard, A. Blake Barclay ’22 (102 thousand followers) and Sam M.S. Welsh ’22 (158 thousand followers), both of whom are newer to TikTok than he is. Their success has made him ask: “What am I doing wrong?”
Chiang took a hiatus from the app and concluded “it honestly doesn’t matter how many followers I have, or who has more followers. It’s more about me, having fun making these videos, and ultimately documenting my time at Harvard.”
Moreover, Chiang often thinks about his status as an Asian American Harvard student on TikTok, a platform on which he says he “[doesn’t] see too many Asians.” Many of the top influencers on the app are white, including most members of the Hype House, a group of some of TikTok’s most popular users who produce content from a house in California.
Chiang wonders if being Asian American has an impact on his ability to gain followers. “I feel like if you’re an Asian influencer, your fan base is more likely to be Asians, whereas if you’re white, Asians and white people also follow you.”
Chiang also says that some people in the comment section of his videos perpetuate stereotypes about Asian Americans, specifically at Harvard. “Some of my comments, people would be like, ‘Of course, he’s Asian; he’s super smart.’”
***
Chiang says the experience of gaining more than 85 thousand followers on TikTok hasn’t changed his impression that “creative” post-graduation careers provide far less financial stability than other professions. Still, he has considered pursuing less “mom-approved” career paths like becoming a wedding photographer or pursuing TikTok further.
That’s why Chiang applied for a position at TikTok as a summer intern. While he doesn’t feel confident that he will land the role, he mentions that shortly after his first viral video someone who works on the partnerships program at TikTok messaged him directly, writing: “We love your content. Keep on making Harvard stuff.”

When Christopher G. Colby ’20 left Eliot House and climbed into the limousine that awaited him outside, not a single other person on Harvard’s campus knew where he was going.
Colby sat quietly in the backseat as the dimly-lit limousine made its way through downtown Boston’s evening traffic.
Soon, some 2.5 million Americans would hear his voice and see his face on Fox News.
Dressed in a gray suit, Colby smiled tightly at the camera. An image of the Boston skyline glittered behind him and below him, a banner read “Harvard sued over single sex-clubs.” Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum announced, “Here now, Christopher Colby, a senior at Harvard University, and a Campus Reform Correspondent.”
Campus Reform is a media website operated by The Leadership Institute, a nonprofit that, in its own words, “teaches conservatives of all ages how to succeed in politics, government, and the media.” The Institute’s top donors include the Charles Koch Foundation and the anonymous conservative groups Donors Capital Fund and Donors Trust. Billing itself as “America’s leading site for college news,” CampusReform.org employs college students — “Campus Correspondents” — to write articles about perceived ‘liberal bias’ on college campuses.
Campus Reform also acts as a middleman that places college students on television networks like Fox News for short media segments — college students like Colby. According to Media Matters, in March 2018 alone, Fox News ran at least 53 segments about controversies on college campuses, 40 of which were previously reported by Campus Reform. 15 of those 40 segments either cited Campus Reform explicitly, or contained an appearance from a Campus Reform correspondent.
When the limousine arrived at the television studio, Colby sat down, put his ear piece on, and stared at the wall. He was alone, far away from the main Fox studio in New York City.
“It’s just you in a dark room,” he recalls. “How oddly metaphorical.” The dark room was a good metaphor, he explains, for the absence of political disagreement on Harvard’s campus. At once, no one was listening and everyone was listening.
“Unfortunately, it led me to believe that I could just moonlight as a Fox News commentator, you know, without any repercussions,” Colby says. “I know nobody here watches Fox News,” he explains. “I was like, ‘Nobody’s ever going to find out about this.’” For Colby, the limo, the dark room, and the media segment were perhaps all just one big inside joke — with himself. “It’s just going to be kind of funny, you know?”
The first two times he appeared on Fox, this proved true. It was a reasonable assumption — despite its massive size, the audience of Fox News has little overlap with the people on Harvard’s campus. These two groups exist in separate information and media spheres, with little to no contact between them.
But Campus Reform correspondents like Colby seem to have one foot in both worlds.
Unbeknownst to most college students, groups like Campus Reform have for the past few years worked to craft an alternative reality about their campuses — an ecosystem that reaches directly through the gates of Harvard Yard. Campus Reform reports on many aspects of life at Harvard deemed normal by most students, including implicit bias training, Black commencement, and divestment activism.
Another conservative group, Turning Point USA — a national campus organization founded in 2012 by conservative ‘boy wonder’ Charlie Kirk — publishes a “Professor Watchlist,” a collection of “specific incidents and names of professors that advance a radical agenda in lecture halls.” It is published in conjunction with Campus Reform, and its listings are often sourced solely from Campus Reform articles.
In 2017, Danielle S. Allen, a prominent Harvard professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, started receiving racist death threats over phone and email. It was only then that she realized her name had been published on the Professor Watchlist.
If not for those messages, she likely never would have known about the alternative reality in which she had suddenly been cast a villain.
In order to create this reality, media outlets need testimony from real college students. Campus Reform acts as a third party broker, bringing those college students from their campus realities to the living rooms of millions of Americans through a prolific media stream: articles shared widely online, and Fox News segments. The way Campus Reform functions, however, means that the narratives these students tell about their schools — the stories that shape the perceptions of millions of Americans — perhaps represent a reality distorted to confirm a pre-existing bias.
Campus Reform correspondents described a preparation process that made their Fox News appearances closer to performances than journalistic reports: The ideas in the scene are determined before it is filmed. The questions students receive on Fox are crafted around the answers they have been prepared to give, rather than the other way around.
Irena Briganti, executive vice president for corporate communications at Fox, and Caley Cronin, a Fox spokesperson, declined to comment on the record on how Fox and Campus Reform prepare Campus Correspondents for their media appearances. Cabot Phillips, the editor-in-chief of Campus Reform, and Jon Street, its managing editor, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the same concerns.
In print, Campus Reform correspondents are conditioned to pitch and write articles about an amorphous conception of ‘liberal bias,’ typically yielding stories centered largely around identity: race, sexuality, and immigration status. These articles are then widely proliferated on social media — but only within specific circles.
Phillips and Street also did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Campus Reform’s pitch selection process.
Like a drumbeat, college conservatives report being marginalized and silenced on campus. Many say Campus Reform presents a unique opportunity for them to speak out. But given the largely distinct spheres of their campuses and the audiences Campus Reform targets, their articles and media appearances serve only to fortify the existing echo chamber among those who had bought into it from the start. Rather than speaking out, these students are speaking in — on behalf of larger conservative interests.
Taken together, this system leads to a warped media narrative about college campuses in which the majority of students live in one reality, and a select few are deployed by a sprawling media empire to help create a divergent, parallel reality.
When those two realities collide, rarely is it pretty.
When Campus Reform found Arik C. Schneider, he never imagined his face would soon appear on Fox News.
A Campus Reform correspondent interviewed Schneider for an article about an expansion of the University’s “Diversity Peer Leaders” program when he was a sophomore at UCLA. Schneider considered the program a waste of Department of Education money and condemned it. In the article, he quips, “On the plus side, this shows Trump’s administration is creating jobs.”
A few days after the article was published, Schneider received an email from Campus Reform offering him a “unique media experience.” At first, Schneider assumed the organization wanted him to go on the radio. But as he emailed back-and-forth with Campus Reform over the next 24 hours, Schneider saw he had underestimated the group: The unique experience they meant was Fox News.
Schneider would soon appear on Fox during a segment regarding “UCLA Spending to Combat Social Injustices” — the same topic on which he had voiced his opposition in the Campus Reform article.
When Schneider was tapped to appear on Fox, the people who tapped him already knew his opinion on the subject.
For Colby, this is an essential part of how the process works.
In his case, a Harvard friend who was connected to Campus Reform — and who knew his politics — recommended him as a correspondent. As with Schneider, when Campus Reform reached out to Colby, it did so sure of his conservative bona fides.
Soon after Colby agreed to discuss the lawsuit regarding Harvard’s single-gender social organizations on Fox, he received a call meant to prepare and vet him for an appearance before an audience of three million.
“It’s like a rehearsal, basically,” Colby says.
Colby and Schneider both explain that during the preparatory phone call, they went through the content of what they would say on air. Colby is unsure whether the people he spoke with on these phone calls were from Campus Reform, Fox, or both. Schneider says that he spoke with a person from Campus Reform.
“I ended up being in a phone call with one of the senior staff members for about an hour as he went over talking points and such,” Schneider recalls. “Refining them so there’s no verbal slip ups — just so I knew exactly what to say.”
The preparation for Schneider’s Fox appearance was atypical for someone meant to serve as a source in a piece of journalism: Rather than preparing for questions, Schneider prepared answers. “I was able to write talking points, things I wanted them to talk about, and then from that, they then generated the questions,” he explains. “They didn’t tell me those ahead of time, but they mostly generated them in accordance with the talking points I submitted.”
Colby describes a similar process. “It was like: ‘Here are the talking points that we are pitching to the news network. And then the host will take those points and generate their own questions.’”
Emily M. Hall ’18, who worked as a Campus Reform correspondent while an undergraduate at Harvard and continues to do so at Yale Law School, declined to comment on the preparation process for her six Fox appearances.
Students work with the Campus Reform staff members to refine their talking points, chiseling them into punchy soundbites designed to present Fox News viewers a specific narrative of college campuses.
By his third appearance on Fox News, which followed the divestment protest that took place amidst this year’s Harvard-Yale game, Colby felt he had become an expert.
“Harvard-Yale protesters on their way back to Cambridge and Yale — on buses: Ooh, isn’t that cool?” he says, explaining his thought process. “‘Don't you see how they’re arguing against fossil fuels, but they’re using fossil fuels?’ This is catchy stuff — and they liked it,” he says.
Colby said something nearly identical when he appeared on Fox.
Colby and Schneider’s experiences demonstrate that Campus Reform works with the students to prepare for a journalistic report on Fox News that is in fact closer to theater — the segment shows a narrative that has been carefully vetted, rehearsed, and predetermined. Despite the appearance of a back-and-forth, both inquiry and rejoinder are in fact cut from a single block of stone.
Briganti and Cronin declined to comment on behalf of Fox. Phillips and Street did not respond to multiple requests for comment on behalf of Campus Reform.
Colby compares the process to car advertising: “People don’t sell car ads to networks to get them to buy cars,” he reflects. “They sell car ads to networks in order for people that have bought cars to feel better about buying a car.”
During his first Fox appearance, Colby sat in the dark studio, a smile on his face as he strained to hear the anchor through a scratchy earpiece.
Anchor Martha MacCallum went through the prompts about the University’s sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations. But then Colby heard a question unrelated to the answers he had prepared.
MacCallum glanced towards her notes and then stared directly at the camera: “Now, it’s interesting because there are groups at Harvard that are ethnically-based,” she said. “Do those groups exclude people who are not of that ethnicity?”
Colby remembers this, the final question of the segment, well: “They threw me this horrible race-bait question,” he says. Colby says that he felt caught off guard. In the clip, he continues to smile and hesitates only slightly before answering.
“You can’t just be like, ‘You’re racist,’ and hang up the phone — because that’s not good dialogue,” he says. “But you also can’t just look at them and be like, ‘Oh, I completely agree.”
In the moment, he decided to settle on “Yeah, to a certain extent,” and referenced a 2017 Campus Reform article written by Emily Hall about Harvard’s first Black Commencement ceremony.
“Black graduate students at Harvard University are planning a first-of-its-kind graduation ceremony for black students,” the article’s teaser reads. “There is no ‘White Graduation’ scheduled, but Harvard will hold its third-annual ‘Latinx Graduation Ceremony’ the same day, and last month offered a ‘Lavender Graduation’ for LGBTQ students.”
“A very interesting battle,” MacCallum says in the clip. “Christopher Colby, thank you very much for coming on tonight — good to have you with us.”
In theory, Campus Reform correspondents are looking for articles that align with Campus Reform’s amorphous mission of exposing ‘liberal bias.’
In practice, sources reveal a pitch process that trains, conditions, and encourages Campus Reform correspondents to attune themselves to key words, topics, and trends that focus on political correctness and identity. Campus Reform correspondents must develop and hone their own sense of what ‘stories’ will please their editors — and their audiences.
Natalie B.T. Le, a masters student at the Harvard Extension School, first encountered Campus Reform at a libertarian conference she attended as an undergraduate. She quickly applied to become a Campus Correspondent.
Eventually, though, her relationship with Campus Reform soured. As Le got further into the organization, she grew less comfortable with their pitching and writing practices.
“There’s a reason why I stopped writing for Campus Reform,” she says.
But for a year, Le published articles with Campus Reform while an undergraduate at College of Charleston and later at Harvard.
“When you get accepted, you get a call with [Campus Reform] to make sure everyone’s on the same page,” Le explains. “Because you don’t want people to be confused, and then pitch the wrong things.”
To avoid this, Le explains, “They give you tips on how to find the stories.”
As per Campus Reform’s suggestion, Le set Google Alerts for “Free Speech,” and “Social Justice.” From there, it was up to her to comb through the stream of results that poured into her inbox each day and select stories to pursue further.
Schneider also published written articles for Campus Reform.
After his first Fox News appearance, he said he was enamored. He wanted more, so he applied to become a Campus Reform Correspondent. In February, Schneider published an article in Campus Reform with the headline: “Harvard group for ‘anti-Zionist’ Jewish students fights ‘oppression,’ like ‘capitalism.’” Though he is a Campus Reform Correspondent at UCLA, Schneider’s jurisdiction is not limited to any one school.
He says he has two ways of coming up with pitches for Campus Reform.
The first is rather tedious: About once a week, Schneider systematically scrolls through the homepages of different college newspaper websites — including The Harvard Crimson — and scans the headlines. He’s looking for something specific, though sometimes, it can be hard to articulate what that is.
The second is Google Alerts — the same strategy that Campus Reform taught Le.
“I look for very specific search terms like ‘College Protest,’ ‘College Israel, Palestine,’ ‘College Chinese,’” — Schneider pauses, and tries again. “You know, ‘China,’” he explains. “I’m throwing a giant net into the ocean and seeing what happens.”
“A lot of it is just trial and error,” he says. “Learning how to separate the good stories from the bad, figuring out what they will and will not accept.”
Internalizing those skills is lucrative, since Le reports that Campus Reform’s compensation structure rewards the prolific. The group ranks Campus Correspondents by precious metals: Beginning as Bronze-level correspondents, Le explains, students can advance to the next level — first Silver, then Gold — by writing more articles.
Le says that bronze-level correspondents are paid $50 per article, while gold-level correspondents — who attain their elite designation after publishing 15 articles — can receive up to $100 per piece.
Eventually, though, Le realized that the subjects the outlet was interested in covering — specifically articles regarding transgender and gender non-binary people — conflicted with her values. As her reservations grew, Le began to distance herself from the group. Campus Reform emails would sit unread in her inbox. Le’s articles remain on the website, but her author link redirects to a Campus Reform home page, her profile erased.
After a year of writing articles, Le got a phone call. Campus Reform had an offer for her. It told her it wanted her to appear on Fox News to discuss the ongoing lawsuit challenging Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies, which some critics claim discriminate against Asian Americans.
Le claims that Campus Reform wanted her to “say certain things” about Harvard and the lawsuit — things that she disagreed with, phrased in ways that made her uncomfortable. Le declined the appearance.
Over the subsequent months, Campus Reform called Le on at least two additional occasions to ask her to appear on Fox News. Each time, she recalls, they wanted her to discuss the admissions lawsuit with specific, predetermined talking points, asking Le to paint Asian Americans like herself as victims of discrimination. Each time, she declined.
Unlike with Schneider and Colby, Campus Reform and Fox’s interest in Le had little to do with her willingness to promote specific talking points about a controversy — in fact, Le repeatedly expressed that she was uncomfortable with the script they suggested. Le had never been outspoken on the admissions lawsuit: It was her race, Le claims, and not her political views, that recommended her to Campus Reform for an appearance on Fox.
Eventually, Le redirected Hannah Blair, her contact at Campus Reform, to Romil A. Sirohi ’21, an acquaintance from the Harvard Republican Club. In a Facebook Messenger chat from Nov. 21 2017, Le introduces Sirohi to Blair and explains that he may be better suited than her to appear on Fox.
“Hi Romii! (sic)” Blair writes. “Can you tell me your overall thoughts on the story?”
Before Sirohi responds, Blair sends two more texts in succession. “I also believe that affirmative action should be based on socioeconomics rather than race.”
“Whoops I’m sorry I copied and pasted the wrong text,” she explains. “meant to send this” She sends a FOX opinion editorial with the headline: “Is Harvard racist? If you’re Asian-American, their admission policies just might be.”
“I oppose racial affirmative action,” Sirohi replies. “I support holistic admissions, including economic affirmative action.” (Sirohi notes that his opinions on race-based affirmative action have changed since 2017; he now supports the practice.)
“Thanks! I’ll be in touch when I hear back from Fox,” Blair writes back.
Two hours pass before Sirohi types “Lmk.”
Four hours after the initial text, Blair replies with Fox’s answer. “They moved forward with another students (sic),” she informs Sirohi. “I’m sorry it didnt work out!”
Blair’s messages suggest that Campus Reform cleared potential guests’ opinions with Fox prior to their appearances on air.
Blair could not be reached for comment on her exchange with Le and Sirohi. Briganti and Cronin declined to comment on this apparent practice on behalf of Fox. Phillips and Street did not respond to multiple requests for comment on behalf of Campus Reform.
I ask Le why she believes Campus Reform was so persistent with her specifically — despite her saying no over and over again.
“Oh, I was one of the few Asians,” she says.
The first two times Colby appeared on Fox News via Campus Reform, almost nobody at Harvard noticed. The third time, however, that changed. The world of Campus Reform and Fox crossed into his life at Harvard.
When Colby attended the Harvard-Yale game in New Haven this November, he watched as students stormed the field during half time to demand that Harvard and Yale divest their endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt. The following Monday, he appeared on Fox News to talk about it.
Fox and Friends airs at six a.m., so it was still early in the morning when Colby returned to campus after his appearance. Soon, strange messages began to appear on his phone and computer, texts and emails about his TV appearance hours earlier. The messages were from Harvard students, not the national audience of Fox viewers, and Colby knew many of them.
For the first time, Colby’s secret life as a Fox correspondent became widely known at Harvard. As the segment spread across campus via social media that morning, the two divergent realities collided.
As he waited in line for lunch, Colby says he felt people staring at him. “It was like everybody knew me all of a sudden,” he remembers. “Not the good kind of know.” From Colby’s perspective, it seemed as if Harvard had turned against him.
When people at Harvard got an insight into the parallel media sphere their classmates inhabited — and saw how Campus Reform, Fox News, and Colby himself were portraying Harvard, many were infuriated.
That same day, Colby also received multiple texts from his contacts at Campus Reform asking if he would discuss the protest again on different segments airing throughout the afternoon and evening. He repeatedly turned them down: He had class, and he was exhausted and wary.
Eventually, however, Colby agreed.
He had made a calculation: Perhaps a second, more measured appearance could help him reclaim the narrative. “Some of the things I said in the first one were pretty callous,” he admits. “I stand by what I said, but it was pretty brutal.” He pauses. “It doesn’t help that you know, you have to smile the whole time.” If Harvard saw a tamer version of his position, perhaps the campus would forgive him.
Colby told the same story about Harvard on Fox News twice that day — but he attempted to address two very different audiences. In the morning, he performed for a national audience of Fox News viewers. In the evening, he spoke with Harvard’s campus in mind.
This time, he hadn’t gone through the same preparation process with Campus Reform as he had for his previous three appearances on Fox. “There was no planning whatsoever for the second one,” he recalls. He was permitted to come up with his own talking points, phrase things how he wished. Colby repeats the word “reasonable” again and again.
“It tells a different story,” Colby explains. Without oversight from Campus Reform, he hoped to win back Harvard.
When his two worlds collided, Colby faced a swift backlash.
When Professor Danielle Allen emerged as a threat to the conservative agenda, she was vilified in the media sphere created by Fox, Campus Reform, and Professor Watch List. That world crossed into her own in the form of racist, sexist threats.
“Hey, you f*****g c**t, you. Professor Watchlist b***h,” one anonymous voicemail said. As a barrage of similar messages poured into her email and Twitter accounts, the strange phrase “Professor Watchlist” appeared repeatedly. This was how Allen found out she had been “watchlisted.”
Launched in November 2016 by Charlie Kirk, “Professor Watchlist” is a website run by Turning Point USA — whose mission is to “expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” According to the TPUSA website, as of 2019 Charlie Kirk had appeared on Fox News, CNBC, and Fox Business News over 600 times.
As of 2016, the site listed 143 professors by name. Campus Reform served as the singular source for 75 of those.
Allen’s listing on Professor Watchlist references an article she published in February 2016 as a Washington Post contributing columnist. In it, she cites Hannah Arendt and draws a parallel between the rise of Donald J. Trump and Adolf Hitler to illustrate, in her words, “how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country.” That nuance was lost in the Professor Watchlist posting, which claims that “said that the rise of Donald Trump is just like the rise of Hitler.”
On the evening of April 1, 2017, Kirk appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson’s evening show on Fox News. Carlson begins by introducing Professor Watchlist, and together he and Kirk work through a list of professors they have deemed worthy of watchlisting, the names and photos of these academics flashing across the screen. Then Allen’s face appears.
Kirk and Carlson do not click past her profile — and with each second that her face flickers on the screen, each second that Kirk continues to rant about her Washington Post article, lamenting that “She teaches this in class,” Allen’s national profile among Fox viewers grows.
Charlie Kirk could not be reached for comment.
Allen was unaware that she had been pilloried on Fox, her name and face appearing on televisions across America. She remained unaware until the anonymous phone calls began.
Something else must have happened, Allen reasoned, to prompt this new wave of negative attention. This was how she learned of the Carlson segment. “Once something’s amplified on TV,” she explains, “it’s just a different level than when things are only circulating as text on a newspaper or a website.”
As with the Professor Watchlist profile, Allen had unknowingly become a prominent villain in the alternative media narrative — only finding out through the pernicious consequences for her emotional and physical safety.
Another voicemail said: “Yeah, yeah, Danielle. You’re a lowlife f*****g n****r motherf*****g c**t, you know that? Saying what you say about Trump. You f*****g n****r b***h. F*****g scum. I hope he pisses on your grave some day. Ah, you’ll outlive him but maybe his kid will piss on your f*****g grave and shit on it.”
Allen reported the voicemails to the Harvard University Police Department.
Kirk’s allegations on the Carlson segment are inaccurate — he claims repeatedly on Fox that Allen ‘teaches this in class,’ but Allen maintains that she does not. Neither Kirk nor Carlson offer any evidence to support the claim.
Allen soon attempted to correct the record.
On May 1, 2017, she wrote to Fox News to record a complaint about the segment, writing that her photo was broadcast next to inaccurate commentary about her by Kirk.
On July 6, after two further inquiries from Allen, Tucker Carlson responded.
In correspondences between Allen and Carlson, Carlson repeatedly asks Allen how he could have verified that she does not teach the comparison in class. In her replies, Allen holds that without any evidence or sources to support Kirk’s claim, the burden of proof does not fall upon her.
Carlson responds, “I hear that a lot, unfortunately.”
Briganti and Cronin declined to comment on Carlson’s behalf.
The second time Colby appeared on Fox to discuss the Harvard-Yale protests, he had also hoped to span the two spheres — to little avail. The “more reasonable” segment seemed to fall on deaf ears at Harvard. “I’m sure nobody watched it,” he says.
Allen’s attempt to bridge separate media spheres was equally unsuccessful. Carlson declined to apologize or correct the record, letting the unsubstantiated and contested claim stand.
“And I have clarified my evaluation of your character,” Allen wrote. They had no further correspondence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A total of 40,246 students applied to Harvard College’s Class of 2024, marking the lowest number of applications in three years.
The figure signifies a drop by more than 3,000 applications from the previous admissions cycle, when a record-high 43,330 students applied to the Class of 2023. Still, the number of applications for the Class of 2024 marks only the third time in the College’s history that applications have exceeded 40,000, representing a slight bump from the 39,494 applications to the College’s Class of 2021.
“We continue to be excited by the extraordinary students from across the nation and around the world who apply to Harvard College,” Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in a press release Wednesday.
Female applicants slightly outnumbered their male counterparts, comprising 50.2 percent of the applicant pool. The share of applicants interested in studying Computer Science increased slightly, as did the number of students who indicated an interest in the physical sciences. Biological and social sciences remained the two most popular prospective fields of study for applicants.
Harvard’s announcement of the application numbers coincided with the unveiling of a new financial aid initiative that will eliminate the summer work expectation for incoming students receiving aid from the College.
In the press release, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said the initiative’s goal is to create more opportunities for incoming classes in the summer before their freshman year.
“This initiative is part of a broader effort to ensure that students can engage fully, explore bravely, make authentic choices, and realize their full potential as members of the Harvard community,” Gay said in the press release.
Phillips Brooks House Association executive director Maria J. Dominguez Gray expressed gratitude toward the source of the initiative’s funding, and also discussed the initiative’s aim of affording students more flexibility to engage in public service.
“We were fortunate to receive funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative three years ago to forgive summer earnings for many students on financial aid, but we soon found demand exceeded our existing funding,” Gray said in the press release. “This aid expands options for students who may work in the Summer Urban Program in Boston or Cambridge, area homeless shelters, or as Mindich Service Fellows.”
Since the launch of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative in 2005, Harvard has continued to enlarge its financial aid program. The budget for undergraduate financial aid in 2019 totaled more than $200 million, marking a 148 percent increase since the Financial Aid Initiative began.
The admissions announcements come as Harvard continues to battle a lawsuit alleging its admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants, who made up roughly a quarter of this year’s pool. Plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions appealed Judge Allison D. Burroughs’s October 2019 decision in the University’s favor exactly two weeks ago.
The College already admitted 895 students to the Class of 2024 via its Early Action program in December 2019, an increase in early admits from last year. Regular Decision applicants will receive their decisions on March 26.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 4, 9:20 p.m.
Harvard administrators discouraged all non-essential international travel for spring break and prohibited University travel to countries with a Level 3 Travel Warning from the Centers for Disease Control in the wake of increased global concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in an email to Harvard affiliates Wednesday.
The email from University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen comes just over a week before students and faculty depart for spring break.
The three administrators restated University-related travel restrictions to China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea — where a Level 3 Travel Warning from the CDC is currently in place — adding that they “strongly discourage” personal travel to those areas.
The email said that anyone who comes to Harvard from those areas, including visitors, must submit a health form to HUHS and self-isolate for a likely minimum of 14 days.
In cautioning against non-essential international travel, administrators warned of the possibility of possible future travel restrictions and the possibility of complications upon return to Harvard.
“You will be subject to any restrictions in place at the time of your return, not only at the time of departure,” they wrote. “Return to the U.S. may be difficult, and after your arrival you may be required to stay away from campus.”
At a Tuesday meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Nguyen and FAS Dean Claudine Gay warned professors they should begin preparing for a variety of disruptions to teaching and research. Gay recommended that the faculty learn to use Zoom, a remote teaching platform.
The Wednesday email also advised Harvard affiliates planning to travel within the country to use “caution and judgment” in their planning and regularly check for new information regarding the outbreak, directing them toward the University’s new coronavirus website.
University officials continue to meet consistently to update contingency plans and will continue to update Harvard affiliates through emails and the website, Lapp, Garber, and Nguyen wrote.
In an additional Wednesday email, Registrar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael P. Burke — who is also the co-director of the Harvard College Emergency Management team — said he will provide biweekly emailed updates on coronavirus. He also said the College plans to keep four dining halls open during Spring Break to accommodate students who choose to stay on campus.
“The updates will include everything from new guidelines regarding travel; hygiene and safety tips; academic impacts; the status of major events, and other important notices,” Burke wrote.  “You can expect to be hearing from me every Monday and Thursday beginning next week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An effort by Kirkland House to modify its shield hit a roadblock after the Harvard Trademark Program denied the House’s initial design proposal.
Kirkland Faculty Deans Faculty Deans Verena A. and Tom C. Conley informed residents in an email last week that the trademark office recently determined the new design — three stars arranged in an inverted triangle position on a black and crimson background — was registered to someone else last year.

“We have to run it through the Trademark Office again before we can start using the shield in any shape or form,” they wrote.

The snag in the new shield’s approval process comes after a years-long redesign effort. The current shield — a cross adorned with three stars — has sparked controversy because of complaints that it resembles the flag of the Confederate States of America.

In February, Kirkland House representatives presented the initial proposal to redesign the flag a meeting of the Committee on Student Life. Soon after, the House received preliminary approval from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana pending a review by the trademark office.

University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email that the University’s trademark office discovered the proposed design would possibly violate a registered trademark.
“The Trademark Program ordered a trademark design search and the results uncovered that the proposed Kirkland House shield design would have potentially infringed on an existing trademark registration,” he wrote. “Consequently, the Trademark Program recommended that another shield be designed.”
After the denial of the new design, Kirkland affiliates voted last week between two alternative designs. One featured the same shield but with three stars across the middle, while the other featured a crimson shield with a black bar bordered by white stripes, as well as three white stripes in the bar. House leaders have yet to announce the victor.
Kirkland House Committee Co-Chair Andrea J. Zhang ’22 said that while the setback was “a little disappointing,” she is happy that Kirkland is making progress in its redesign effort.
“The entire time I was very aware of the fact that just because there's so many issues that come up along the way,” Zhang said. “It's not too surprising for us to face bumps in the road, because the process has been happening for I believe four years. So it's not like at the first bump we faced we were like, ‘Oh, no. I'm shocked it didn't go through the first time.’”
Kirkland House Committee Co-Chair Maranda Ngue ’22 similarly said while the denial of the new design “slowed down” the process, she said the House’s continuing efforts have left her “optimistic.”
“Kirkland has been waiting for this for many years, and we've been working towards it. So the fact that we're finally getting a new shield is something that Kirkland is really excited about,” she said. “Even though we've hit a little bump on the road I know that in the end, Kirkland will be very happy with what we end up with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scientists at Harvard and Beihang University released a study in late February revealing a new soft robotics product – an arm with the gripping characteristics of an octopus’s tentacle.
The “Tentacle Bot” uses its flexible design and suction cups to grip and manipulate objects with a variety of different shapes, according to a press release about the study.
Katia Bertoldi, a professor of applied mechanics at Harvard, who co-authored the study, said the team’s research began by trying to discover more about the octopus tentacle’s structure.
“The octopus arm has this intriguing shape,” Bertoldi said. “We tried to understand the implication of that.”
“As we went more and more, we also started building things,” he added.
Li Wen, another co-writer and professor at the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation at Beihang University in Beijing, wrote in an email that the researchers progressed from analyzing characteristics of the octopus tentacle to beginning to create the bot.
“When we search the octopus arm on the internet, we observe that the octopus arms are taper-shaped and are highly variable between different species,” Wen wrote. “Inspired by the tapered morphological feature of octopus arms, we are very curious how this tapered shape would benefit the design and performance of soft actuators and soft robots.”
Wen added that, unlike past work on robots that attempted to replicate individual octopus characteristics, the Tentacle Bot combined different aspects of the cephalopod’s physique.
“In contrast to the previous studies on octopus-inspired robots, which focused primarily on either arm motion, or sucker action alone, this present tentacle bot integrates both concepts and adopted an optimal tapered shape of the tentacle for a better gripping performance,” Wen wrote.
August G. Domel, a Harvard Ph.D. graduate and co-author of the paper, said he thinks the bot may have practical implications for manufacturing.
“I can imagine this being used in some sort of assembly where you have to basically manipulate a wide range of objects and maybe it isn’t just one consistency coming through,” Domel said. “We include suction and bending, and we have this nice tapering angle too. We’re able to really grab a wide range of things. So you can imagine that if you’re on some sort of manufacturing application, this can really be useful.”
Wen added that he thinks the Tentacle Bot could be used in the future for more complicated operations, such as medical procedures.
“In the future, we hope this robot can be safely operated in the company of human bystanders to work on a few complex missions together,” Wen wrote. “We also expect this robot could help the doctors to carry out some medical diagnosis.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ray-Ban, a luxury sunglasses retailer, opened a Harvard Square branch in September, the first standalone Ray-Ban store to open in Massachusetts.
Julian K. Hammer, a Cambridge Ray-Ban employee, said the store is the seventeenth to open in the nation. Hammer said he was excited by the decision to open up a store in Harvard Square and that he has enjoyed working there.
“They could have easily gone to Seaport or Newbury Street, but I think they really thought carefully about picking Harvard Square because we want to be here,” Hammer said. “It's been a real pleasure to meet and work with all these different people.”
Ray-Ban was founded as a brand for pilots in 1936, but it quickly garnered international recognition, expanding into countries like China and Japan.
The arrival of a new store comes at a time of rapid commercial turnover in the Square, following the closure of stores like Papyrus and Black Ink. And in October, Out of Town News, the former tenant of the Harvard Square Subway Kiosk and 60 year-old cultural landmark, closed its doors.
Hammer, who grew up in Cambridge and around Harvard Square, said he is familiar with the string of closures the Square has faced.
“Bartley’s is the last remaining burger place. Dickson Brothers is the last remaining hardware store,” he said. “So the Square is at a pivotal point of change.”
“As a larger business, we want to play a part in that change but for the good,” Hammer added.
Harvard Square Business Association executive director Denise A. Jillson wrote in an emailed statement that the association was pleased with Ray-Ban’s presence in the heart of Harvard Square and its willingness to engage with its neighbors.
“We were delighted to welcome Ray-Ban to Harvard Square,” Jillson wrote. “Upon their arrival, they immediately and enthusiastically joined the HSBA. We look forward to partnering with them as they settle in and become active and engaged community partners.”
Hammer said his work at the store has allowed him to meet a diverse set of shoppers.
“We get to meet different people from different walks of life every single day,” he said. “We just want to be a part of the fabric of this community.”
Ray-Ban is located on Brattle Street between Felipe’s Taqueria and Rebekah Brooks Jewelry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Topdrawer — a lifestyle accessory store geared toward “creative nomads” — is set to open in Harvard Square in April.
The Japanese-American company sells sustainable tools that “can be used for a lifetime and handed down to children and grandchildren,” according to its website. The store’s wide-ranging inventory includes backpacks, notebooks, and sunglasses, designed to empower their users to be “creative” and “productive.”
The upcoming opening marks Topdrawer’s 14th location worldwide and its third in Massachusetts. It will join existing stores in Boston and Brookline.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said Topdrawer’s offerings are designed to mimic what one might find in the “top junk drawer” in their house.
Jillson added that her organization was “looking forward” to having Topdrawer in the Square.
Topdrawer will join a number of stores that have opened or will open in Harvard Square this year, including bubble tea chain Kung Fu Tea and sandwich shop Fóumami.
Peter Dunn — president of Itoya Topdrawer Corp., Topdrawer’s parent company — said the company chose Harvard Square to open a store because many store employees cited neighborhood as one of their favorites.
“We have a huge long-term relationship with Harvard Square,” Dunn said. “We think our people are here, you know, people that appreciate these types of products and use them.”
Topdrawer will replace Black Ink, a stationery store that shuttered in December after nearly two decades in operation.
Black Ink’s departure due to rising rent prices sparked a wave of criticism against Asana Partners, the North Carolina-based real estate company that owns the property. Before Black Ink’s closing, the store launched a “Dear Asana” letter-writing campaign, placing large sheets of paper in the store for customers to write messages to the company.
Dunn said he learned of the circumstances of Black Ink’s departure after the store decided to close, adding that the “rent is expensive” at the property.
“There’s no question it’s probably the most expensive we pay in the country,” he said.
Paige G. Coolidge ’21, co-founder of Fig. Magazine, a campus fashion publication, said she felt the plethora of lifestyle stores in the Square may reflect a growing trend toward “fad-ish” commerce.
“I think that it’s almost ritualistic the way that these sleek and chic shops are popping up in Harvard Square and on other college campuses,” she said.
However, Coolidge added that she would be interested in shopping at Topdrawer.
“I would check it out for sure,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former New York Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse and President of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA Sara Nelson criticized Harvard for its stance in ongoing negotiations with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers at an Institute of Politics event Wednesday.
Greenhouse and Nelson argued that institutions like Harvard should not wait for the National Labor Relations Board to implement a rule that would exempt “graduate students who receive financial compensation” from being defined as workers. The widely-expected decision would effectively overturn a previous NLRB ruling upholding the right of graduate students to unionize.
The union —which engaged in a month-long strike in late 2019 before returning to work at the beginning of the year — remains in talks with the University on a contract. The sides have yet to strike an agreement that addresses the three major provisions that prompted the strike: compensation, health care, and grievance procedures for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints.
In an interview prior to the event, Greenhouse and Nelson cited the possibility that Harvard may find a legal technicality to not recognize the HGSU-UAW.
“Harvard did not agree to a so-called union security clause which would require all, you know, grad teaching assistants to contribute towards the union,” Greenhouse said.
Nelson agreed, stating that the exclusion of this clause is “kind of a backdoor way to not recognizing a union.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment in response to Nelson and Greenhouse’s criticisms.
HGSU-UAW representatives distributed a flyer at the event titled “Why is Harvard hiding behind Trump!?," which cited concerns about Harvard allegedly “consistently violating labor law.”
Boston Globe reporter Katie Johnston moderated Wednesday’s panel discussion with Greenhouse and Nelson, which was followed by an audience discussion.
Despite their criticisms, Greenhouse and Nelson said they believe the University has a “conscience,” contrasting Harvard to the University of Chicago, which has declined to negotiate with its graduate students.
Andrew M. Bergman, a graduate student in applied physics and HGSU-UAW member, disagreed with Greenhouse and Nelson’s assessment of Harvard during a back-and-forth at the forum.
“As an entity, they are not behaving as though they have a conscience,” Bergman said.
Nelson also spoke about labor issues emerging from the coronavirus epidemic, citing the reluctance of Republican congressmen to provide health care-related government assistance.
“I think that what the coronavirus epidemic is doing is exposing the hypocrisy of the healthcare debate,” Nelson said. “The coronavirus is demonstrating, literally, the foundation of unions—that an injury to one is an injury to all—because this is not something that you can hide from.”
Nelson is currently considering a campaign to lead the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the largest body of organized workers in the United States. If elected, Nelson would be the federation’s first woman leader.

Nearly one month after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences overwhelmingly voted in favor of fossil fuel divestment, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Monday that he will report back to the faculty once the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — has considered the resolution.
“There’s been conversations with the Corporation, but the Corporation is not prepared to respond yet,” he said.
Members of the Corporation are aware of the resolution calling for Harvard to divest its $40.9 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies, but the group has yet to convene a meeting discussing the resolution, Bacow said.
“They’re aware of the vote because that gets shared with them,” he said. “But we haven’t had a Corporation meeting to actually discuss that.”
“Once the Corporation has considered it and dealt with it — as I mentioned to the FAS faculty — I will report back to the faculty,” Baccow added.
The Harvard Medical School Faculty Council also called for the University to divest from fossil fuel in a vote last month.
Last month, Georgetown University decided to divest from all of its public securities of fossil fuel companies within the next five years. Yale University’s Faculty Senate also recently held a debate on divesting its endowment from fossil fuel investments.
Bacow said that Harvard will make its own “independent decision” on divestment.
“Yale does what Yale thinks is appropriate to do, and we do what we think is appropriate for Harvard,” he said.
During Tuesday’s faculty meeting, Philosophy chair Edward J. Hall requested an update from Bacow on the Corporation’s response to divestment.
“We anticipate that the Corporation, however it responds — we hope positively, given the clarity of the community-wide call for leadership — does so in such a way as to make its reasoning public,” Hall said in the meeting.
Bacow responded in Tuesday’s meeting that the Corporation is “aware” of the resolution, but did not have time to consider it fully in its last meeting, which happened just after the February meeting during which faculty voted 179 to 20 in favor of calling for divestment.
In Monday’s interview, Bacow responded to student groups who protested his speech at the College’s annual junior parents weekend. Some of the protesters included those advocating for fossil fuel and prison divestment.
Bacow said that he was finishing his speech at the time of their protest and called the students “passionate.”
“They held their signs,” Bacow said. “I gave my talk.”
“I said that I had found Harvard undergraduates to be smart, creative, thoughtful,” he added. “And then as students held up their signs, I said, and also, as you can see, passionate. And I said, passion is good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Student Council discussed a forthcoming survey to gauge the state of graduate student advising during its monthly open meeting in Lehman Hall Wednesday night.
The council — the official representative body for all GSAS students — also discussed career services available to graduate students, upcoming elections, graduate student union bargaining, and campus safety.
Germanic Languages and Literatures Ph.D. candidate Zachary M. Hayworth, who serves as president of the GSC, introduced GSAS Advising Project director Reba Rosenberg to present a survey to gauge the state of advising within the school. The survey is set to go live in April.
“We just really want to understand what's happening in each different department, each different area — even within a certain department, you're going to have differences, right?” Rosenberg said. “You want to capture as much of that as possible, which is why now we're going to be doing this survey.”
The council also invited Office of Career Services representative Caroline Wright to inform students about the range of professional development resources available to graduate students.
Wright stressed that the OCS provides significant support for students engaging in job searches, running the gamut from interest assessments and resume review sessions to mock interviews and negotiation tips.
“GSAS career services has traditionally seen students towards the end of degree completion, when perhaps they’re realizing that they may want to go on in a nonacademic job market,” Wright said. “We never want students to feel that they're scrambling. It's never too early to engage with our office.”
History of Science Ph.D. candidate Erik Baker shared an update on the state of bargaining between Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the University over its first contract. While Baker said the union has reached favorable agreements over some of its central proposals, such as personal day allowances, transit subsidies, and a just-cause clause for termination, he acknowledged that the University and the union still remain at an impasse over other issues.
History of Science Ph.D candidate Alexis Turner, who serves on the council’s Safety Committee, also shared a brief update about measures to address safety concerns posed by scooters on campus. Turner said that administrators are considering building secure scooter racks outside of academic buildings to prevent scooters from being taken inside, where they may prove a fire hazard.
“Scooters are a terrible thing. Apparently some scooter ran into someone and broke their ankle,” Turner said. “Also, some student almost set their room on fire while they were charging their electric scooter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s nearly-complete, newly minted Science and Engineering complex in Allston will feature state-of-the-art student club spaces, sustainably designed labs, and a number of amenities, one of the project’s architects told The Crimson on a first-look tour of the complex Wednesday.
The tour offered a peek into construction progress on the building, which is slated to open in Fall 2020. Leaders of SEAS student organizations including Women in Computer Science and MakeHarvard also participated in the closed tour.
Steven J. Cortesa, a mechanical engineer on the project, said the complex will include roughly 2.5 times the previously available undergraduate lab space, three times the open lab space, and five times the club-specific space.
Other features of the new complex include a flight lab, maker space, library, food servery, and an eight-story atrium, according to architect Michael Noll, who led the tour.
It will also play host to a wide variety of teaching spaces, from a 300-person lecture hall to a smaller classroom featuring a wall of 21 video monitors.
Throughout the tour, Noll emphasized the complex’s environmental sustainability. Classrooms will feature reclaimed wood floors, and all building materials used were vetted for hazardous chemicals in collaboration with the University’s Office for Sustainability.
Additionally, the architects configured the building’s ventilation system — particularly in wet lab spaces — to lower air change rate and waste less energy. Wet labs also feature a lab write-up space partitioned from lab benches, reducing the overall space that requires air exchange.
Faculty, administrative offices, and labs will likely transition into the complex in June, Christina Zaldana, the manager for advising programs and diversity outreach at SEAS, said in an information session before the tour. Student groups and researchers may have the opportunity to begin utilizing the space as early as this summer, and open houses and orientations for undergraduate and graduate students will take place in August.
Addressing concerns about the distance between the new complex and other Faculty of Arts and Sciences buildings, Zaldana said that students already travel comparable distances for academics, citing undergraduate researchers’ trek to Harvard Medical School from Cambridge as an example. The complex sits around 1.7 miles away from the Radcliffe Quadrangle and one mile away from Harvard Yard.
A new shuttle route will run between the Quad and Allston from 7:00 a.m. to 7:20 p.m. every 20 minutes on weekdays.
“This is actually one of the examples of the feedback that we got from students,” Zaldana said. “It was initially going to be a transfer from shuttles to get from the Quad to the new campus.”
She added that the complex will also include features that address two other major student concerns — safety and food. The building is equipped with blue emergency phones and extensive exterior lighting, according to Zaldana. In the SEC Café, students will be able to pick up bagged lunches similar to FlyBy meals, or buy food using BoardPlus or their Graduate School of Arts and Sciences meal plan.
SEAS faculty will begin teaching the complex’s inaugural classes in September, and a grand opening event with University President Lawrence S. Bacow will follow shortly after.
“We want to think about it as Harvard is really growing as a campus, not just that SEAS is moving away,” Zaldana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the spring season brings about the re-emergence of warmer weather and melting snow, with it too comes the beginning of another lacrosse season.
It had been 301 days since the Crimson (1-2) last took the field in a matchup against Yale that concluded the up-and-down 2019 season. Since then, the program has undergone some changes–including the introduction of a new coaching staff. Gerry Bryne, a former assistant coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish team for 16 years, now takes the reigns for Harvard and looks forward to having an immediate impact.
While there have been some changes on the coaching end of things, as for the players, much of the team is still composed of its core members from last season. The squad not only features a veteran roster that includes 14 seniors, but the entire starting lineup, aside from one player, is returning and want to continue to build and get better as a team.
One of these starters is junior goalkeeper Kyle Mullin, who, when asked about the transition from the 2019 season to the 2020 season said, “Our entire coaching staff changed in the offseason and there was definitely a learning curve for us when we got back to campus. As a group, we’ve just tried to embrace the new culture that this coaching staff has brought in. We’ve got a great group of guys who are all committed to each other and the process of becoming a better team.”
Harvard began the season by making the near-two hour commute to take on in-state rival, No. 19 UMass Amherst (4-2), on February 22. Although the Crimson allowed the first goal of the game, the team fired right back, going on a 6-0 run. However, each goal proved to be crucial, as, by the fourth quarter, the Crimson saw its lead vanish and found itself in a tightly contested, 9-9 game. With just over two minutes to go, and the fate of the game still up for grabs, sophomore midfielder Nick Loring came up big for Harvard, scoring what would ultimately be the game-winner (and his second goal on the day). The Crimson held on to the 10-9 lead, winning its first game of the year and avenging the home-opener loss to UMass last season.
Three days later, Harvard hit the road once again, this time traveling to take on the Holy Cross Crusaders (4-2). Although Holy Cross may have had an advantage, as it began its season on February 1 and already had four games under its belt by the time the Crimson came to town, Harvard certainly had a chip on its shoulder–likely due to the heart-breaking, 11-10 double-overtime loss Harvard suffered in last year’s matchup. The Crimson came out strong, rallying off four straight goals to grab the early advantage. However, in a mirror opposite of the UMass game, it was the opponent who this time went on a 6-0 run, and, by halftime, the Crimson found itself down by two. Despite being down 9-5 with 10 minutes left in the game, Harvard did not quit. In fact, the team rallied all the way back, and, with 45 seconds left, the Crusaders held only a 9-8 lead. Yet, even with the impressive comeback, the Crimson came up one goal short, suffering its first loss of the year at the hands of Holy Cross.
The following Saturday, Harvard made the trip to New York to take on Albany. The high-scoring first half saw a combined 17 goals, with the Great Danes carrying a 10-7 lead into the second half. Despite being down by three, the Crimson had the momentum going into the third quarter, as the team had fought back from an early six-goal deficit. The battle continued through the third quarter and into fourth–setting the stage for an intense back-and-forth. The score was tied several times in the final stage of action: 12-12, 13-13, and 14-14. Every time Albany would go ahead, Harvard would strike right back. The Crimson put up a valiant effort–led by hat tricks from junior midfielder Jack Frisoli and sophomore attacker Austin Madronic–but the Great Danes put in the eventual game-winner with three minutes left, and Harvard would fall 15-14.
Three games into the young season, the Crimson has already been battled-tested, as each contest has been decided by a single goal. When asked about the start to the season, captain and senior attacker Kyle Anderson, who is tied for the team-lead in points (nine), said, “We’ve been in every game, with two of the three coming back from five-plus goal deficits. We definitely need to eliminate the lulls we get into for entire quarters of games. We’re working on cleaning up our clear and stick work every day to make sure we are efficient on the field and not hurting ourselves. Coach Byrne loves to say ‘don’t give the other team opportunities that they can’t earn themselves,’ and if we clean up our turnovers in the middle of the field, we can do just that.”
“All of us are very excited as to where this season can go, and, obviously we’d love to be three-and-zero instead of one-and-two, but I’m confident that early season, one-goal losses will not define this team,” Anderson added. “We know how to stay in games and execute comebacks late in games. The final step will just be finishing the game with a win.”
Harvard will have its chance to get back on the field and bring its record back to .500 this Saturday, with its home-opener against Fairfield. “We’ve been on the road for our first three games this year,” Mullin said. “We’re really excited to play on home turf on Saturday. Fairfield is a very good team and we want to improve on our mistakes from our past games and try to get one in the win column.”
It is clear that there is a fire inside this team and a hunger to prove itself–especially within a conference that boasts several top teams in the nation. Both Anderson and Mullin discussed the ultimate goal of making the Ivy League Tournament, but that the key is to take the season one game at a time and focus on improving with each one.
The next chance to do that will be at 3:00 pm this Saturday, back home at Jordan Field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a six-game win streak, the Crimson (20-7, 9-3 Ivy) closes out its regular season this weekend at Lavietes against the Bears (13-12, 6-6 Ivy) on Friday and the Bulldogs (22-6, 10-1 Ivy) on Saturday. Harvard looks to secure a flawless record at home and come away with the No.1 seed in the Ivy League Tournament.
Despite having momentum on its side, coming away with two home victories will be a formidable task after losing senior guard Christian Juzang to an injury last week against Columbia. Juzang had been the starting point guard for the majority of the season, averaging 6.7 points and 2.8 assists, as the anchor of the Crimson offense.
“We’re kind of on pins and needles here going into the weekend,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “It definitely hurts not having Christian, in particular, being our quarterback and leader in Bryce’s absence.”
With Juzang sidelined, it is going to be crucial for the Harvard bench to step in and try to fill his shoes as the team’s leading guard. Fortunately for the Crimson, the team has prided itself in its ability to use its depth and find key contributors off the bench. In a season where the team did not have the services of senior forward Seth Towns and senior guard Bryce Aiken, it still found success with a variety of lineups.
“We have been steadfast here in the growth of our program to try to create and develop the depth of our bench,” coach Amaker said. “So now you know we have a great opportunity for us to have to dig a little deeper. Different guys have to be able to contribute and I'm anxious to see how it's gonna play out but I'm confident that we’ll be okay.”
In particular, the strength and versatility of its veterans will be critical for Harvard in order to maintain its stellar play in these high-pressure games. Junior guard Rio Haskett and senior forward Justin Bassey will be looked upon to control the offense in the absence of Juzang.
“Rio’s got to be the stabilizer for the team and we've got to look to him for strength and confidence,” coach Amaker said. “Justin needs to play like a veteran and lead us when we need it.”
The leadership of these veterans will be especially needed against Brown and Yale, two opponents that the Crimson have already faced in tough nailbiters. Against the Bulldogs, Harvard allowed a four-point play with under a second left that would have tied the game had senior guard Azar Swain not missed the crucial free throw. The following day, the Bears defeated the Crimson on an and-1 buzzer-beater from junior forward Tamenang Choh.
In order to come away with the victory against Brown this time, Harvard will need to limit the foul trouble it had in its last game against the Bears and play stalwart defense on senior guard Brandon Anderson. Anderson has averaged 17.6 points for the season and put up 22 against the Crimson in the last matchup.
With a win against the Bears, Saturday’s game against the Bulldogs could be a game to decide the No.1 seed in the Ivy League tournament, provided that Yale also beats Dartmouth.
“We need to make sure that we come away this weekend with two huge wins so that we have the opportunity to win another championship, going into the tournament,” said senior guard Justin Bassey,
The Bulldogs come into this weekend with the best conference record led by junior forward Paul Atkinson and junior guard Azar Swain. Both Atkinson and Swain are averaging more than 16 points, with Swain having torched Harvard for 33 points in their last matchup. Despite the potential high stakes of this game, the Crimson look to treat its preparation like any other.
“I think we treat every game as big,” senior forward Chris Lewis said. “So where they are in the schedule doesn't really matter. We know that we're going to always prepare the same for every team and we're going to show up and bring the effort that we need to.”
Lewis and all the other seniors are entering the home stretch of their Harvard careers. This weekend will be the last time they play at home before the tournament.
“I'm proud of this group of what they have accomplished,” coach Amaker said. “We're hopeful that, you know, they're able to finish it in a way that I know that they're excited about the opportunity to do so.”
The seniors on this team have been trying to win the league and make it to the NCAA tournament for four years. With a couple of victories this weekend, they hope to take one more step to the glory they’ve been waiting for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All year, college hockey squads keenly anticipate the postseason. But for the Harvard men’s hockey team, an extra week in between the regular season and the playoffs would have been okay.
After failing to clinch a top-four conference finish in the regular season, however, the Crimson (13-10-6, 11-6-5 ECAC) does not have the luxury of a first-round bye in the ECAC tournament as it has in the past four campaigns.
This weekend, Harvard will host St. Lawrence (4-25-5, 2-18-2) in a best-of-three series in the opening phase of the conference playoffs. If the adversaries split results on Friday and Saturday (7:00 p.m.), a Sunday matinee (4:00 p.m.) will decide which group moves on to the quarterfinal round.
While a bye week would have provided a much-needed mental reset as well as physical rest after a 29-game slate, the Crimson remains eager to continue the schedule.
“At this point, [the prospect of a bye week] doesn’t really matter,” said Harvard sophomore forward Jack Drury. “I think we’re all excited to play, and we’re looking forward to a good challenge.”
The last time the Crimson skated in the first round of conference play, it forged a path straight through the bracket en route to the NCAA Tournament. The goal will be the same this time around, as winning the ECAC playoffs is Harvard’s only remaining hope at qualifying for the big dance.
As the highest-ranked seed outside the top four, the Crimson has drawn the lowest-ranked opponent for its first-round matchup. The Saints have just two wins to their name after 22 ECAC contests during the regular season. The Canton, N.Y.-based program sits 58th among 60 Division-I teams in the Pairwise rankings.
Despite its status as a bottom feeder, St. Lawrence took an emotional game from Harvard toward the end of the 2019-2020 schedule. On senior night at Appleton Arena, the Saints overwhelmed the Crimson with physicality and energy, snapping a 21-game winless stretch comprising a majority of the season.
“It showed that they have a lot of good players,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 of the latest bout with St. Lawrence. “I thought their compete level was better than ours on that night…. They’ve been a team that has lost a lot of one-goal games, overtime games. So, they certainly have our attention, and we’re going to have to be at our best to be able to advance.”
The 6-3 affair knotted the season series, as the Crimson bested the Saints at its home Bright-Landry Hockey Center, courtesy of a prolific night on the powerplay.
The recent history between the first-round foes is impossible to overlook ahead of the weekend series. Not quite as recently, the teams last collided in ECAC the tournament in 2016, when co-captain Kyle Criscuolo ’16 sent his squad through to the final with an overtime tally.
The mid-March thriller marked the final career win for the decorated class of 2016. But coach Donato’s program continued its upward trajectory the following year, seizing the Whitelaw Cup as the conference’s postseason champion on its way to the Frozen Four.
In the two seasons since, however, Harvard’s ECAC title hopes have ended in the semifinal round, at the hands of the Saints’ nearby rival, Clarkson. This Friday kicks off the Crimson’s potential road back to Lake Placid, N.Y., currently where the annual semifinal is staged. Harvard has advanced to the historic hockey site in five consecutive campaigns.
“Other than being at home, everything else has to be earned [this weekend],” coach Donato said. “A team like St. Lawrence that plays really hard and competes physically should force us either to raise our level, or we’re not going to have the success we want.”
Of course, St. Lawrence will have a say in whether the Crimson can keep its impressive postseason streak alive. This will not be an easy task for Harvard, as the Saints play a physical game — one which matched up favorably against the comparably undersized Crimson lineup several weeks ago.
Aside from a statement victory at Harvard’s expense, St. Lawrence’s regular season was uninspiring. The Saints struggled to pot the puck all year, finishing 58th of 60 teams nationwide in goals per game (1.76). The other side of the ice also proved challenging, as the program sits 52nd in the country in goals against per game (3.47).
These averages pale in comparison to the Crimson’s goals per game (3.59), ranked fifth in Division I, and goals against per game (2.86), more pedestrian at 33rd. Yet, in the foes’ most recent clash, St. Lawrence found twine a season-high six times, bucking these trends.
The most troubling matchup for St. Lawrence, though, may be on special teams. Harvard brings its NCAA-leading powerplay (32.0%) to the series in its home barn, where the Saints will attempt to counter it with a 58th-ranked penalty kill (73.6%).
The Crimson wields a handful of offensive weapons who contribute to the lethal man advantage. Chief among them is freshman Nick Abruzzese (13–26—39), who is among the top five per-game scorers in college hockey (1.34).
Abruzzese’s running mate for most of his debut season has been Drury (18–16—34), whose timely goals and noticeable leadership have allowed him to emerge as one of the league’s most dynamic two-way forwards. Sophomore Casey Dornbach (12–22—34) has rounded out the dangerous top line more often than not in 2019-2020.
In 22 games playing together, the Abruzzese-Drury-Dornbach combination has united for 82 points this season (31–51—82). Whether this trio opens the upcoming playoff series together remains to be seen. A pair of disappointing losses to the Saints and Rensselaer — the team that usurped the Crimson for the final top-four spot last week — caused coach Donato to jumble the combinations up front.
“We have confidence in all our guys in the lineup,” said coach Donato when prompted on his forward lines. “If we have to make some adjustments during the game — whatever it might be — when it’s all said and done, to me it’s less about who guys are playing with and more about what kind of effort we bring and what kind of consistency we bring.”
On the back end, sophomore Jack Rathbone (6–22—28) facilitates on the powerplay and at even strength, owning the nation’s third-highest points-per-game mark among defensemen (1.08). Junior Reilly Walsh (6–17—23) and freshman Henry Thrun (3–16—19) are also key providers on Harvard’s blue line.
By comparison, St. Lawrence receives more balanced contributions, albeit less production all around due to the team’s scoring struggles. In late February’s six-goal rout of the Crimson, only two Saints notched multi-point performances. Were it not for the empty-net goal, all 13 skaters who got on the board would have pitched in just one point.
Sophomore forward Zach Risteau (7–15—22) paces the Saints roster in scoring, though Harvard held him scoreless in both meetings in the regular season. Juniors Bo Hanson (5–14—19) and Keenan Suthers (9–5—14) are other sources of production.
Along with 6’5” senior winger Alex Gilmour, the 6’8” Suthers gave the smaller, skill-oriented Crimson particular difficulties in the squads’ most recent tilt. Suthers missed the final two games of the regular season, but his status for this weekend is unknown.
“They come really hard,” Drury said. “They’re a big, physical team…. On our part, I think we have to match it: come with the same amount of physicality and energy and know that both teams’ seasons are on the line, so everyone is going to be going as hard as they can.”
For Harvard, a successful first-round weekend begins with a composed first period on Friday. In late February, St. Lawrence put the Crimson on its heels early with its energized play and senior-night crowd backing it. Thursday at practice, coach Donato stressed the importance of a solid start — one that will enable his high-octane Harvard group to dictate the terms against an opponent with a vastly different style.
“It comes down to the details,” coach Donato began. “Having everybody on the same page [is important], and making sure that we come out and start the game accordingly and don’t wait to see what they bring, but really come out and try to establish our game and persevere for however long it takes.”
If the Crimson once again is stunned by an underestimated competitor, the upcoming series could become a three-game slog between the old and new schools of ECAC hockey. A best-of-three win would give Harvard a chance to avenge last Friday’s defeat to the Engineers, who will rest this weekend along with Cleary Cup winner Cornell, second-place Clarkson, and third-place Quinnipiac.
“[In the regular season], I think we proved to ourselves that we can beat good teams, and we can play a really good game,” Drury said. “I think we know we have to be more consistent with it. We talked about using our speed a lot more, sticking to our systems a little bit more, and getting off to hot starts…. We want to carry that lesson into the playoffs.”

Dear Freshman,
Housing Day is one of the best days of the school year, period. It’s one of the handful of times Harvard upperclassmen pull their school spirit out of the recesses of their deep dark souls, all to welcome all you into your new home. It’s a day of celebration and the resolution of blocking drama, as well as a great send-off for Spring Break. But how does Housing Day work? What should you do to get ready?
Having a game plan for Housing Day is key. This includes deciding things a few days in advance. Do you have a midterm on that day? If so, maybe River Run isn’t for you. Do you have a paper due? Try to finish it a day in advance so you can just enjoy the festivities. Don’t stay up all night after doing River Run (or just in general), because you’ll need to be well-rested for the full day ahead. Your blocking group should be waiting in a predetermined suite (preferably in the Yard, where all the action happens), so it’s important that you SET! MANY! ALARMS! and wake up early enough to get ready, look cute, and make your way to whomstever’s room you’re going to be waiting in for dorm storming. Another solution to this issue is having a sleepover the night before! But don’t sleep on a hard floor the whole night—it’s not worth it. If there isn’t a couch to crash on, just sleep in your own bed and waltz over well-rested in the early morning.
We highly recommend doing something cute as a blocking group for breakfast in the suite, whether it’s buying bagels the night before and doing a bagel and fruit breakfast, or making pancakes on a hot plate that you definitely don’t have in your dorm because those aren’t allowed.
Don’t be too concerned about documenting the experience, although it can be fun to set up a phone camera somewhere that can see the room to have a recording of upperclassmen bursting through your door to look back on in the years to come.
IMPORTANT: Make a promise with your linking group that neither of you will tell the other what house you got before both of you have been dorm stormed. Knowing what neighborhood you’ll be in majorly ruins the surprise.
The most important thing to know about Housing Day is that ultimately, all of the houses are great. We’re sure you’ve made your House ranking lists, but every House can be a home for you if you give it a chance. Lean into the spirit of the day, and the love and excitement that the upperclassmen are screaming at you! (Read: Don’t be rude and cry if a House that you didn’t want dorm-storms you. These students are genuinely thrilled to be welcoming you into the place they call home! Feed off their energy! Stay open-minded!) Go to all of the events: tabling in the Berg, House dinner, and whatever fun post-dinner activity your new House has planned for you. Don’t let your potential disappointment keep you from engaging to the fullest—we promise you won’t regret it.
Housing Day is exciting for everyone, freshmen and upperclassmen alike. We hope you have the Best day: that you’re safe, that the Housing Gods smile down upon you, and that, whatever happens, you welcome your new House with open arms, just like it does for you.
Flove,
Your Trusty Upperclassmen

Ever wonder why you never see people who live in the Quad? It’s probably because they’re reveling in the pfhenomenal House that is Pforzheimer. With singles basically starting your sopfhomore year and amenities including the Spfa, the Quad Grille, and a room reserved solely for guinea pigs, Pfoho is Harvard’s best-kept secret that we’ll let you in on. There really is no place like Pfohome.
All About Housing
The silver lining of living in the Quad is more of a gold standard when it comes to housing — as Analli C. Torres ’21 says, “There’s no such thing as a bad room in Pfoho.” Sophomores are likely to receive n or n+1 housing, a benefit that can be hard to find in other houses. These luxurious singles — many of which are just as big as singles reserved for upperclassmen in houses on the river — are highly attainable, making the transition from the Yard to the Quad a breeze.
In addition to the perks of singles, the different layouts of suites are endless. Configurations vary from apartment-style suites of hallways with singles, to duplexes, which are two-floor suites that provide much more vertical space. Pfoho’s various buildings, which include the Jordans and Moors Hall, each offer different options for your next three years.
Pfoho also boasts the infamous Belltower Suite, which has four singles in addition to a common room. This suite is known for its pfabulous parties, but more importantly, for its history — it’s where Mark Zuckerberg met his wife at a party. If he can find love, there’s hope for us all, and the secret may lie in Pfoho Belltower. We’re already filling out the application to transfer to the Quad.
Community
Walking into Pfoho feels like walking home. Filled with the warmth of the friendly building manager and the peace of the dining hall, Pfoho’s community is one of the strongest. As Malia Marks ’21 says, “Any time I want to see people, all I have to do is leave my room.” Perennially occupied by people studying, watching sports in the JCR, or playing with Pfoho’s guinea pigs, there’s never a lonely moment.
The two levels of Pfoho’s dining hall attract people to a central area in the House. The main floor has larger tables that give you your social fix, while the top floor is basked in sun during the day and filled with small tables for people to study and have more intimate conversations. During dinner, the dining hall comes alive as people entertain the House on the grand piano with songs from Ed Sheeran’s new album to breathtaking classical music.
Regular outings such as dog sledding, snow tubing, grape picking, jam making, and pasta making characterize Pfoho’s tight-knit community, in addition to trivia nights and Pfaculty Dean high tea. A crowd favorite event, Pfortuna, is a weekly gathering on Thursday nights in the JCR that includes music and a rotating menu of snacks to get ready for the weekend. If you’re ever feeling tired of dhall food, test your cooking skills with Cooking With Pfriends, where you can bond with new and old friends by cooking a three-course meal.
Freshmen are immediately welcomed into the Pfoho community with Quadded, a day-long retreat (including an ice bar!) to make you feel at home. Pfoho greets incoming sopfhomores with its Bear Buds program, which pairs an upperclassman with a pfrosh so that, before you even move in, you’ll already have a familiar face in the House and a resource for any questions or worries you may have about living in Pfoho (although, what kind of concerns would there be living in such a great House?). Torres says, “It’s the best House, objectively,” and we can’t argue with that.
Your Questions, Answered
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about Pfoho?
MM: A single sentence: It’s not that pfar.
What can I expect on Housing Day?
MM: We get up earlier than 6 a.m., there’s just screaming in the dining hall, and we walk all the way to the Yard. People are fighting to wear one of the 10 polar bear suits. You have to apply to wear the suit, and there’s a leader of the polar bear army — it’s an official position.
What’s your best memory of Pfoho?
AT: I don’t have a specific moment that is super memorable, but the thing I cherish the most is every single night — the ability to just sit for hours and talk to people.
What Hogwarts House would Pfoho get sorted into?
MM: We’re so Hufflepuff. The warm hug of community is Hufflepuff-y.
Around the House
Pfoho is full of character, so we interviewed Pfoho student Max J. Wang ’20, a local celebrity in the House.
What do you like most about Pfoho?
MW: I would say it’s definitely the people. They’re really tight with each other, and everyone’s always got each others’ backs.
Why should first-years be excited about the prospect of being sorted into Pfoho?
MW: Pfoho’s nice, first of all. We have great dorm rooms, people are awesome — not just the students, but also the tutors.
If you could describe Pfoho in 5 words, what would they be?
MW: Roll tide.

With a vibrant community, a variety of social and study spaces, and the offer of a refuge away from the prying tourists of Harvard Square, it’s an understatement to say Currier will not let you down. The smallest House on campus has a reputation which outdoes its size, known for its diverse community and as the returning champions from winning the Green Cup. Being sorted into Currier House this Housing Day would definitely be more of a blessing than a curse.
All About Housing
Most sophomores assigned to Currier House get assigned either in-suite or hallway singles in Daniels Tower, with a few getting doubles. Further, some sophomores do end up in other towers and actually receive junior housing. House Committee co-chair Vivien Thommes ’20 said that “I want to stay in my junior house and because I think I cannot buy enough furniture to stock up a senior room.” The four towers — named Gilbert, Bingham, Daniels, and Tuchman after four Radcliffe College alumna — are all connected through their basements. The House also boasts about 56 kitchens — every single floor and common room has a kitchen. Community baking is very much a tradition — many students have their own baking pans, and even if you miss Autumn Apple Picking, Currierites love to share baked goods and host baking study breaks.
Community
The locus of Currier House is the dining hall because “At any time to go in and out of the building, people have to walk through the dhall, have to see each other,” explains HoCo co-chair Jorge Campos ’21. Currier dhall is the most distinct from the dhalls of other Houses, due to the fountain display in the middle (with a skylight to brighten the area) as well as the obvious camaraderie on display. Sunday nights in particular are special; above and beyond the usual Brain Break fare chicken wings, nachos, or other delicacies are rolled out around 10 p.m. “There are just trays of food and people are just hanging out in the dining hall doing work super late,” said Campos. The dhall also stays open between 2:30 and 4:30 p.m., as well as post-7:15 p.m. “Our opinion on it is, you know, it is a little bit harder to get up here, and the class blocks don't really line up with the official HUDS time schedule,” says Robert A. James, who has worked at HUDS for 16 years and at Currier for the past two years, noting that it’s not an official policy.
Currier House has many recreational and workspaces for students. On entering, one passes the bells desk, a desk that students can sign up for shifts for two hours per week. ”All you have to do is to sit here and log packages as they come in,” said Olivia H. Nie ’20. “I also do like I get to see a lot of my, my friends that I might not run into all the time.” Down a staircase from the lobby, one enters the Fishbowl, which has glass walls, many sofas, and a large projector for movie screenings. Tucked underneath the two staircases is the Mousehole, whose walls can close to create a mall private space, equipped with a very pricey speaker system and Alexa, where people often hold impromptu dancing or singing sessions. The Poker Room is a popular study space equipped with whiteboards and desks, and Currier House’s ten-man suite offers party rooms like no other. Currier Gym, three music practice rooms, a dance studio, reading rooms, a meditation room, a massage room (and chair), and a Makerspace replete with 3D printer and art supplies mean that it’s possible to hole up in Currier the whole weekend, whether your intent is to belt out a paper or relax with friends. “I think the most important thing is that it's not just a space where you live; it's like when you are home,” said Thommes.
More About Currier
Beyond being the only House on campus being named after a woman, Audrey Bruce Currier ’56, Currier was also the first House to push for race relations tutors and first-gen tutors. One tutor is even working on an augmented reality app to describe the history of the House room by room. While the Quad at large and Currier specifically are often celebrated for their community, in Currier, this includes more than just tutors and staff. “For me, I see the same 150-175 people day after day. You know, it's less time to get to know people,” said James. “I love the fact that they can get away from the stress level when they come to the Quad.” Currier also brags of a variety of House group chats, including for board games, video games, and the popular Currier memes chat. Anyone can submit to the digital picture frames on the walls, whether about a specific happening or even something from daily life.
While Currier is a 13-minute walk from Harvard Yard, Thommes and Campos frequently loop back to the Quad for meals, and Thommes vouches for the reliability of the shuttles, making the Yard and River “super accessible.” The distance has certainly not stopped Currier from outperforming other houses in IMs; they are currently 3rd place in the Straus Cup rankings, an impressive feat for the smallest House. Campos fondly remembers a soccer match from last semester where they hired Uber Blacks for the trip down to the soccer field. “It was really one of my favorite times here because we like de-seeded Quincy House and they were sitting on number one and we beat ‘em, and our Deans came out to the soccer game. We had 40 people out in the sidelines screaming, cheering us on,” he recalls with a grin.
Thommes and Campos say that attitudes towards getting housed in the Quad have been changing the past few years. During Housing Day 2019, Currier-Wire (the house-wide email list) was flooded with pictures and videos of freshman crying tears of joy. The HoCo chairs have one last piece of advice for freshman this Housing Day — give the Quad a chance. “I'm just sold on this House being the greatest thing that happened to me at Harvard,” Campos said.

From spacious singles to designated party spaces (i.e. the Aquarium) to Cabot Cafe, Cabotians love the physical spaces in their House. But any Cabotian will tell you the House’s real selling point is their tight knit community and inviting atmosphere that never fails to make you feel at home. 
All About Housing
If you’ve got your eye on a single, Cabot has your back. Former House Committee co-chairs Ashish Dahal ‘20 and Ian V. M. Saum ‘20 said all sophomores who want a single can get one. Many sophomores opt for a hallway single, but others go for a suite. Don’t worry though, because in Cabot you won’t have to choose between having a common room or being in a single — all suites in Cabot are n or n+1 housing.
Cabot’s buildings surround three sides of the Quad Lawn, giving many of the rooms a gorgeous view of the green (and the cute dogs that it is often full of!). Most buildings are connected by tunnels, so you can still stop by brain break during late night study sessions without ever having to step outside.
If the spacious singles weren’t enough, Cabot also has a myriad of common spaces. You can always find fellow Cabotians hanging out in the popular Cabot Cafe, open late on weeknights, as well as in the pottery studio, game room, an art studio, and many study spaces throughout the House. If you’re into fitness, Cabot’s gym is arguably one the best of any House on campus, with Dahal going so far as to say “It’s better than the MAC, I stand by it.” Of course, Cabot is well known for its Aquarium, a designated party room. Besides the Aquarium, Cabot houses the historic Library Suite. A former library, the spacious common room of this suite is lined with bookshelves connected to five singles.
Community
“Cabot is actually one of the best-kept secrets at Harvard — it actually has a really wonderful community and you get to know most people in the House. I think most people who are in Cabot legitimately really enjoy the House community,” Bobae C. Johnson ’21 says. From house-themed musicals to a dedicated meme page (“Cabot Memes for Fishy Teens”) and more, Cabot really creates a “microcosm of the greater Harvard community,” Dahal says.
Cabot hosts the annual Festivus, a winter holiday party featuring catered food from many different cultures and a fire for the symbolic burning of Grievances (a Seinfeld inspired event, according to Dahal) — a great way to purge all your negative energy from the semester. A highlight of Festivus is the talent show, where students can uniquely showcase their skills. Every year, one student typically sings a parody of a popular holiday song (Cabot-themed of course!). Last year, Saum and his blockmates recreated the iconic Mean Girls dance.
Cabot maintains its tight knit community with regular Steins, coffeehouses, and even a monthly “Formal Hall” event. Every month, the HoCo chairs put out a spread of hors d'oeuvres and drinks for students to enjoy, each with a different theme ranging from Jeopardy to Saum’s personal favorite: murder mystery. Who doesn’t love an excuse to dress up fancy with all your friends? Steins are also a well-loved event, with each one having a different fun activity. “What we like about our steins is that we always try to have a fun, inclusive event,” Dahal says. “We just want the steins here in this House to always be very popping.” The most popular is Karaoke Stein, but trivia night Stein and video game Stein (nicknamed “Super Stein Bros”) are also big hits.
Perhaps Cabotians’ favorite aspect of the community is how supportive it is of new initiatives. “Cabot is incredibly supportive of any sort of activity you might want to get kick-started,” Johnson says. “Cabot Cafe was just a student idea that was tossed around that is now still in business 6 years later; Queer Cabot was created only a couple years ago and is now one of the bigger communities in Cabot!” For example, Saum and his friends recently started a Wine Society in Cabot. Another example is CabLift, a new fitness group for Cabot students.
Your Questions, Answered
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House? 
AD: It’s not that far. I can get from Lowell to Cabot in a four-minute bike ride flat. The distance is not that big of a deal. And honestly, the best part of being in the Quad is you get to explore Porter Square and a lot of the other restaurants that are on this side of Cambridge.
IVMS: Community is great, walk’s not that far, we’re all so happy to have you in Cabot.
What should freshmen who get your House look forward to?
AD: There are several traditions in Cabot that are so much fun. We have a big holiday party, called Festivus, inspired by Seinfeld. People from all the other Houses always want to come, but they can’t because it’s Cabot only. They should really look forward to integrating into a community that really fulfills their needs. For a lot of people, they may want to get more involved in the arts. We have an art studio and a community group called Third Space here in Cabot. If you’re into wellness, we have a Wellness committee, or if you’re interested in theater, you can join Theater Board.
IVMS: The community. All my best friends live in Cabot, I’ve made my best friends in this house. The people, the vibe, we all love Cabot here, and we think everyone who gets Cabot will too!
If you had to describe your House in 3 words what would they be?
AD: Quirky, wholesome, and fun.
IVMS: It’s the best.
Talk about your Housemasters/tutors. Are you close with them?
AD: We have some of the best tutors, by far, of any House, I’m going to stand by that. The tutors are not just the proctors you have in the freshman dorms, they’re genuinely like a fun older sibling you can look up to and go to for mentorship advice. The network of tutors really helps to make Cabot a true home.
If you had to liken your House to a fruit, what fruit would it be and why?
AD: Mango, because it’s sweet. Cabot is incredible, great suites, great people, good housing, good community, there’s really nothing you can’t like about Cabot.
IVMS: Grapes, because find me someone who doesn’t like grapes.
