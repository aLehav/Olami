On Saturday, the Harvard Vegetarian Society hosted a debate over the morality of meat that pitted PETA representative Bruce Friedrich against a member of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society. The well-attended debate centering on the ethics of meat-eating was robust and impressive, and the Harvard Vegetarian Society should be commended for holding an event that highlights an important issue for our campus and our society. 
As students from diverse backgrounds arrive at Harvard dining halls, HUDS has made an impressive effort to provide vegetarian eating options. The vegetarian dishes are always clearly marked, as are the options from which vegetarians can obtain protein. HUDS, however, can still do far more to accommodate those who choose not to eat meat. They must remember that while everyone can eat vegetarian dishes, vegetarians cannot eat meat dishes, and thus HUDS must increase the volume and variety of vegetarian options so that vegetarians can easily access a filling and healthful meal on a daily basis. To the dining services’ credit, they are moving in the right direction and hopefully will soon arrive at a point where students of all eating preferences feel happy and nourished after a meal at the dining hall.
Vegetarianism and the treatment of animals have become increasingly prominent recently. Factory farming is being recognized as an important health and environmental concern, and many have realized the potentially negative effects of meat consumption on climate change. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, “meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse emissions.” 
HUDS and student groups should inform undergrads about the impact of their meat consumption on the environment, which might inspire students to eat less meat. Lowell House already has a remarkable student initiative that aims to do just that by encouraging students to sign up for “Meatless Mondays,” vowing to refrain from meat-eating once a week.
The issue of vegetarianism carries weight for numerous reasons in modern society, and the Vegetarian Society should be commended for bringing the debate to Harvard. Together, HUDS and student initiatives can inform the student body about the environmental benefits of eating less meat and encourage students to rethink their food consumption.

This past Tuesday, the United Nations released a lengthy, critical report on last winter’s three-week Gaza War. Unfortunately, the report contains evidence supporting the claim that both the Palestinian and Israeli delegations involved in the conflict committed war crimes and, according to The New York Times, “possibly crimes against humanity.” 
On the Palestinian side, the report holds that rockets were unjustly fired from Gaza into several civilian areas in Southern Israel and, on the Israeli side, that Palestinian civilian communities within Gaza were cruelly mistreated, terrorized, and, in some cases, executed. As is typical of these reports, Israel received the harshest tone of condemnation and was also reprimanded for its use of weapons such as white phosphorus and its failure to preserve intact the local Gaza communities, while the Palestinians were criticized largely for their internecine conflicts. 
Both sides have rejected the report, both sides have claimed that they acted purely out of self-defense, and both sides are, presumably, still seething. Thus the report and U.N. actions following its release have served merely to amplify rather than mitigate the eternal Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
The U.N. threatens that these war crimes could eventually be brought before the organization’s International Criminal Court in The Hague if each party does not launch private investigations into their own actions within the next six months. But the U.N. should be less naive in its threats—as the United States sits on the Security Council, which decides whether certain cases will be brought to the world court, it would strongly hesitate to consent to a case against Israel. This case, then, is not something that would likely ever be brought to international trial, and threatening such grave consequences is extremely counterproductive when the issues at hand deserve much more rationality.
To be sure, we would prefer to see both sides cooperate with the U.N. investigation rather than dispute the findings of the report. The constant—and often violent—struggle between Israel and the Palestinian territories is one of the major sources of stress for the entire world, not merely the U.S. But since both sides will likely continue to insist upon their own innocence, we may as well hope, in the admirable spirit of U.N. naivete, for a much larger step toward peace.
Rather than focusing on the specifics of this report, it would be wonderful to see Israelis and the Palestinians find a stable resolution to their conflict. We are of course aware that such a resolution may be far off, but in the wake of the tragedies in Gaza, we can only hope that it will be reached.

RE: “The Wrong Signals” (Caleb L. Weatherl, op-ed, Sept 11) 

“Rape isn’t funny,” Caleb L. Weatherl states in his article, and that “the wrong signals” is one that everyone can agree upon.  Instead, rape can be terrifying, painful, and prevalent, which makes it a difficult topic to discuss.  Therefore, issues of consent tend to be avoided, distorted, or completely silenced.  So if the only introduction to the issue of sexual assault freshmen received was “Sex Signals,” then perhaps some could say that rape was not treated with enough “gravity,” that there were not enough facts, that it was not Harvard-centric enough, and that there was not enough time for discussion.  But “Sex Signals” is only a beginning.  By turning gender clichés on their heads and mocking sexual misconceptions, “Sex Signals” eases freshmen into thinking about the way we are socialized and how that affects our personal relationships.  Furthermore, it is the focus of a mandatory workshop facilitated by trained members of the OSAPR Student Alliance.    
Weatherl noted in his article many startling statistics about sexual violence on college campuses and attempted to offer insight by explaining that a majority of Harvard students have sex with zero or one partners.  We are happy that Weatherl knows his facts, but he may be surprised to know that freshmen do too, because they learn these statistics and more only minutes into their workshops.  Facilitators share these facts to acknowledge that there is a broad spectrum of sexual experience at Harvard, but issues of consent affect everyone. Unfortunately, simply because a student does not want to have sex does not mean that he or she will not be sexually assaulted.   
Weatherl also noted that there was not enough discussion about rape prevention and then advocated setting boundaries with your sexual partner “so that lines don’t get blurred in the heat of the moment.” We are uncomfortable with this suggestion, though, because rape happens despite setting boundaries. Rape, by its very definition, happens when one person is not respecting the other person’s boundaries.  While we can all agree that communicating with a sexual partner is helpful  this idea only reflects risk-reduction.  The only person who can actually prevent a rape is the perpetrator.    
Rapes portrayed in the media are committed in dark alleys by men in skimasks holding guns.  At Harvard, sexual assaults are rarely committed by a stranger and often occur in a dorm room, but nobody wants to think that their friends, blockmates, or acquaintances could be rapists.  “Sex Signals” shows us that sometimes rapists take Gov 20 or wear DHAs.

To the editors:

 On my graduation night from Yale Divinity School, May 1980, I witnessed an example of racial profiling by Yale Police hauntingly similar to that endured by Professor Gates this year, only the unfortunate handcuff victim was neither famous nor in his own home. And unfortunately, the term ‘racial profiling” had not been coined.   
Rather, the victim was a young African American male who was reclining on the front steps of Hendrie Hall, a Yale building on a public street in New Haven, early in the evening while it was still light outside. His “crime” brought three Yale Police to handcuff and arrest him. When I inquired as a passerby what these police accused him of doing, he wept and replied that he had been sitting or lying on the steps.   
After I sent several letters to Yale’s President A. Bartlett Giamatti and other Yale faculty, his arrest for trespassing was “nolle’d” when it went to court.

To the editors:

I’ve just seen the CNN article about the Holocaust-denier ad and note that “Al Tompkins, a faculty member at the Poynter Institute, ... said he hopes this will become a ‘teachable moment.’” It seems to me that it is also an opportunity for a premier college newspaper to apply skills for investigative journalism that are increasingly disappearing from mainstream print media. What are responsible academic researchers finding out about the motivation and mechanism of such “denial” movements, including denials of the Holocaust, the “birther” movement, and so many more? Do these movements get more visibility or involvement in hard economic straits? What approaches have all media taken to “denial” ads, and with what results? Are “tea party”-type naysayers and shouters denialists, or are they engaged in vigorous public debate? 
By focusing on the one ad, even if it is to criticize it, we give its sponsor too much airtime and give the public too little perspective. With a good follow-up story about both the imperfection of running a newspaper and the minuscule role of deniers in the larger scheme of things, The Crimson would do a great service. 
I believe that the health of a society depends in large part on citizen’s intelligent skepticism—unwillingness to merely accept what is put before it as “gospel” (e.g., there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq because there must be, or because it is “obvious,” or because Saddam says so; ...) and demanding more and better evidence. But there ought to be an articulatable and reasoned distinction between such wise and helpful skepticism and obsessive and irrational denialism.

The country will judge Obama’s first-term success based on the fate of health-care reform. Everyone knows it, and the national debate reflects this reality. However, the craze has pushed a second reality into the shadows: that the grand arc of history will evaluate Obama’s success as much based on his administration’s actions to combat climate change as on its health-care reforms. 
Obama has acknowledged that he is not the first president to try to reform health care, but he plans to be the last. This will not be the case. Regardless of what Obama is able to achieve today, the U.S. will undergo more health-care reform in the future, when evolving circumstances will require policies that we cannot predict now. As a result, there must be reform in the future in order to keep up with changes in how we receive health care. You cannot say the same for climate-change policy. If we fail to act now, there is substantial scientific evidence that we may not get another chance. Estimates suggest that if we surpass the two-degree Centigrade limit adapted by the G-8 this summer, 20-30 percent of species could go extinct and more than 1.5 billion people worldwide could face major water shortages.  While health care is important, it cannot be the only priority of the Obama administration. A superb health-care system counts for little if the world is no longer livable because of dramatic environmental effects brought on by climate change. 
The Waxman-Markey Bill, which the House passed in July, is a strong step in the right direction. But much of the public momentum behind the bill stalled after it was sent to the Senate and health-care debates took over. This is not to suggest that people have completely forgotten Waxman-Markey. Power companies and other opponents of the bill have quietly continued to lobby for lower restrictions and decreased stringency in the proposed cap-and-trade system. An op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer over Labor Day lambasted the bill for the supposed job losses it would cause in Pennsylvania.  The day after, the editor of Fabricating and Metalworking criticized congress for Waxman-Markey’s hidden taxes.  In the face of this opposition—and opponents’ misconceptions—advocates of the bill have offered no response. The White House has remained remarkably silent on the issue, and the congressional supporters of the bill have done nothing to correct misinformation surrounding it. 
Instead, that task has fallen to small, independent think tanks and policy institutes. Their efforts to counter the claims of opponents of the bill have produced eye-opening reports. The most important of these, issued last week by the Institute for Policy Integrity, conducts a cost-benefit analysis of the Waxman-Markey program and finds, counter to objections, that the bill would have a net benefit of as much as $5.2 trillion. The report included a median projection for net benefits of $1.2 trillion and found that even more stringency could actually be more beneficial.  Their estimations also ignore all the indirect benefits, such as improved health due to reduced pollution that will accrue from the bill. 
At the same time that the IPI published its findings, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy published a report that found the Waxman-Markey bill would generate 7,700 jobs in Colorado alone. And the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that Waxman-Markey would have a net positive impact on government finances to the tune of $25 billion. 
The benefits of comprehensive climate-change legislation are undeniable, no matter what its detractors say. Unfortunately, the policy institutes that conduct research demonstrating the benefits of Waxman-Markey do not have a voice that can match the public claims of naysayers. In the din over the health-care debate, it is difficult for their reports to reach the public or the ears of policymakers, while opponents continue to work through lobbyists to weaken the bill.  If the U.S. is to have a meaningful climate-change policy, policymakers cannot weaken the House bill any further. The Obama administration must take a leadership role in moving public debate beyond just health care and revitalize the discussion of Waxman-Markey. 
Health care is a vital issue, but climate change is just as important. It does not behoove us to focus on one to the detriment of the other. Opponents of the bill have focused on the costs that Waxman-Markey will impose on them and not on its potential to move the United States into a truly advanced energy economy that would generate trillions of dollars in benefits. If we want a world that it is worth having health care in, then we must not let opponents of the bill take control of this issue. Evidence suggests that the benefits of this legislation exceed the costs by up to a nine-to-one ratio. Now we must turn that evidence into action.

Due to increased budget cuts, Harvard’s formal Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian language courses have been removed from the curriculum.  The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures’ “E Series”—a sequence of two beginning courses in these three related languages as well as a more advanced tutorial—has been terminated due to the budget cuts which “left virtually no corner of the FAS untouched,” Julie Buckler, chair of the department, confirmed. Instead, students who demonstrate a need to learn these languages can obtain independent tutoring. This semester, two students are taking advantage of this service at the introductory level and six at the advanced level, Buckler said. Despite these cuts, the department was able to expand other offerings, adding second-year instruction in Polish and Czech to the catalogue. In response to cuts in her department and others, Patricia Chaput, director of the language program in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, said she “[worries] a great deal about Harvard becoming enrollment-driven in the teaching of language.” She stressed that some of the less popular, and therefore more threatened, languages at Harvard are taught at few other universities in the United States. Chaput emphasized that these low-enrollment languages can be the “kinds of courses that prepare students for life in a global society” and are often excellent preparation for international careers. Danielle C. Kijewski ’11, a concentrator in Slavic Languages and Literatures, hopes to use her language background in a career in the State Department. She said, “With the ever-increasing ease of world-wide communication and international cooperation, it is more important than ever for students to become well-versed in foreign languages.” Chaput added, “Given that Harvard is a training ground for people who will become some of the top specialists in their fields, it is essential that Harvard retain diversity in language offerings.  Specialists can’t be specialists if they don’t know the languages of the areas they study.” Budget constraints have also affected language study beyond the classroom. Last week, The Crimson reported that free access to the Rosetta Stone language-learning software had been eliminated. The Language Resource Center will offer students, faculty, and staff the software at a subsidized price of $110 per year, discounted from the normal $549 annual subscription price. Chase Russell ’12, a Romance Languages and Literatures concentrator, was considering using the software to practice for his Japanese course outside the classroom, but he said he is not willing to pay the new subscription price. “It’s disheartening. I definitely would have used it; it seems like a good supplement,” he said.

Last night the Harvard Political Union, an outreach subgroup of the Institute of Politics, brought together the leaders of six other campus ethnic organizations to discuss and debate the state of race relations on Harvard’s campus.For many audience members, the event was a rare coming together of the usually disparate segments of Harvard’s active ethnic communities to discuss one of the most controversial issues in public life. Among the groups represented were the student associations for Harvard’s black, Chinese, Asian American, South Asian and Latin American communities. “Despite our campus being so diverse, a lot of students of the same ethnic backgrounds group together and don’t really mix as much as you’d think,” said HPU Chairman Shankar G. Ramaswamy ’11.Aptly, last night’s discussion centered around the issues of “self-segregation”  among ethnic groups on Harvard’s campus. The group quickly agreed that the “dining hall” phenomenon—or the persistence of clusters of white, black or Asian students all eating and socializing separately—was indeed a problem that needed to be addressed. From there concrete solutions were difficult to come by, but audience members took turns relating experiences ranging from racial profiling to their experiences branching out to other ethnic groups.Margaret C. Dang ’12 said that she often feels “uncomfortable” in her own ethnic group, particularly because she does not speak Chinese.“I’ve been trying to find balance,” she told the audience. “I look for people who can accept me for being Asian American.”But for many others in the room, ethic organizations provided a source of familiarity and comfort as they made the transition into college life.“The fact that we’re treated the same based on skin color and being dehumanized can give us shared experiences to bond over,” said Michelle E. Crentsil ’10.Recent events have also placed issues of race in the forefront of many student’s minds. In March, the Chinese community was stunned to find racial slurs painted on the walls of the Lowell House Grille after a graffiti party sponsored by the Chinese Students Association. And this summer, African American Studies Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s arrest and the subsequent allegations of a racial motive catapulted race relations at Harvard to the front page of national newspapers for weeks.Educational and Political Chair of the Chinese Student Association Bonnie Cao ’12 said that despite the March incident, the important event came afterward when the group organized a community rally, “Many Colors, One Harvard,” to draw attention to issues of race.Cao added that she would like to see her organization and others moving forward with tonight’s discussion.“I would like to see more co-sponsored events, more group to group conversations like tonight,” she said.—Staff writer Beverly E. Pozuelos can be reached at pozuelos@fas.harvard.edu.

PRS Clickers, blogs, and even Google’s Android cell phone are all showing up in classrooms across Harvard’s campus. But many Harvard professors say that though the days of internet-free classrooms may be long over, nothing will replace face to face interactions in the classroom that are the foundation of Harvard’s Cambridge-style education model.According to a recent article in the New York times, institutions are becoming more and more willing to pour scarce dollars into interactive technologies for the classroom.Online institutions like the University of Pheonix, Devry, and even Harvard’s own Extension School offer convenient and relatively inexpensive online courses, to busy mid-career students looking to beef up their resumes.Professor of Education Christopher J. Dede told the NY Times that technology could never match the “home runs” that human tutors can deliver. “With technology,” he told the paper, “we don’t aspire to home runs, but good solid angles.” Many of his colleagues at Harvard agree that though technology can be a valuable resource—helping to foster lively discussions both inside and outside of the classroom—it cannot replace the experience of attending an institution of higher learning.“If you could skip college and go straight to the internet, it wouldn’t be needed,” said Richard M. Losick, a professor of biology and head tutor in the Molecular and Cellular Biology department. “The Harvard experience would be missing.”For years, undergraduate students in popular courses like Physical Sciences 1 have used a device popularly known as the PRS Clicker, which is used for in-class question and answer sessions—or often, pop quizzes.The device was created in 1994 by Physics Professor Eric Mazur who said that his aim in developing the device was to enhance rather than distract from the learning process.Losick, who joint-teaches the undergraduate course Molecular Cellular Biology 52, is one of a number of faculty members who have embraced the clicker as a teaching supplement.“I like seeing the class become raucous because students are discussing—going through what it took to understand the material.”Applied math concentrator Michael T. Fountaine ’12 said that a Greek language class that he took in the spring relied heavily on a computer program that facilitated interactions with other students learning Greek at Stanford. “We had blogs with running dialogue, online quizzes, and listening exercises, which were extremely helpful,” he said.But don’t look for Harvard to send undergraduate courses online any time in the near future.“Learning is a social process,” Mazur said. “Technology, if used properly, can enhance this process.”

Harvard club teams are struggling to find adequate practice space in light of the Malkin Athletic Center’s reduced operating hours, a recent impact of the University’s widespread budget-cutting initiatives. The MAC’s weekday closing hours have been tightened from 11 p.m. to 10 p.m., creating a scarcity of room availability for student sport and recreation groups, primarily in booking the MAC’s Mezzanine room. “It has always been tight and it’s always a hotly-contested battle for space,” President of Harvard Taekwondo Khoa Tran ’10 said. “We are all being as flexible as we can.”Yet, many club participants question the University’s priorities and point to a possible conflict of interest. “They schedule all of their paid classes before we club sports even get a look at the list,” said President of the Harvard-Radcliffe Kendo Club, Amanda W. Hu ’10. “So first, we have limited options with time slots and now we lose an hour from our main practice time.”These constraints come in the wake of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ May announcement that three JV men’s sports teams—ice hockey, baseball, and basketball—would be cut and re-emerge this fall at club-level status.Tran said club team representatives attended a mandatory scheduling meeting last Tuesday in an effort to collectively negotiate a new schedule. He said that precedence was given to groups that occupied a particular time slot last year and wished to keep it.“Each club has its own requirements—some need mats to practice, dance groups need mirrors, and so on. Everyone understand the situation and is trying to be accommodating,” Tran said.He noted, however, that scheduling is further complicated as many groups must work around an outside instructor’s availability. “Our instructor, Michael Tang, can only come in after 9 p.m. It’s frustrating because it’s an hour drive for him to get here and then he can only stay for an hour. Last year,, we had him for two,” Tran said.Many teams, accustomed to having the room to themselves, also face other obstacles in having to split the space with other groups. Harvard Taekwondo, for example, will share practice space with the Crimson Dance Team for a half hour on Thursday nights.“It will be an interesting mix because they will be playing dance music while we do our routines. We ourselves yell every time we kick... and we kick a lot,” Tran said.“I don’t think it will be a safety hazard—just an inconvenience,” he added. “But it will all work out because it has to.”Even outside club teams, several MAC staff have noted a general frustration with the reduced hours.“People will show up at 9:25 p.m. and are completely surprised. They get upset but they know that there is nothing I can do,” said Elyse M. Traverse ’11.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Charlesview Apartments, a concrete cluster of 213 low-income housing units near Harvard’s long-envisioned Allston campus hub, stands in desolate disrepair. A few children clatter by on scooters while an elderly woman, accompanied by a young mother pushing a baby stroller, loiters in the mostly deserted courtyard.
“It’s quiet. It’s a nice place to bring up children,” says Ruth Olivole, who has lived at the complex for 15 years. “I don’t want to move. Period.”
But her younger companion disagrees, and indeed, Olivole seems to be more the exception than the rule in opposing the planned relocation of the apartments to a site half a mile west. 
“I’m so sick of waiting,” said Phyllis Lingley, 83, at a recent community input meeting. “This has been going on for years, and we haven’t seen a damn thing built.”
Now, with the City’s approval for the Harvard-backed plan to relocate the  Charlesview Apartments hinging largely on the community’s support, renewed opposition to the proposal’s design may set back residents’ hopes yet again.
A LONG DEBATE
A 2007 land swap agreement between Harvard and the Charlesview board of directors was intended to allow the University to consolidate its Allston land holdings while providing residents with much-desired new housing and amenities.
Yet planning for what would seem to be a mutually beneficial arrangement has dragged on to its sixth year, and many Charlesview dwellers are saying that their patience has been tested enough and that construction should commence.
“Get us out of here soon! Don’t take so long,” said Michelle Davis, a resident who has lived at Charlesview for four years.
Charlesview and its contracted real estate developers, the Community Builders, first floated to Harvard the idea of a land swap and apartment relocation in 2003. Several years passed before the agreement was finalized, and the plan has since floundered in a City review process that includes extensive provisions for revision before ultimate approval. A new and improved draft, now undergoing a period of community input and review, is finally nearing a long-awaited green-light from City planners. 
But again, complications have emerged.  
A vocal and influential contingent of Allston residents, arguing that the plan does not include enough opportunities for home ownership, say that the project strays from established principles of urban design and will create an income-segregated North Allston neighborhood. While Harvard agreed to give nearly two more acres of land to the project to help address those concerns, some local residents maintain that the University ought to allocate even more land to the Charlesview development and surrounding areas, rather than letting the property sit vacant.
But according to Susan S. Fainstein, a leading figure in urban planning and a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the current draft of the Charlesview plan is “well-designed” and includes an appropriate level of density and open space. She says that she believes the plan should be approved as soon as possible, and that the potential hindrance posed by the Allston residents’ concerns could be in part due to a class-based conflict of interests.
“You have a group of low income people who are under stress and a group of higher income people who probably aren’t so anxious to have these tenants to live with them. A lot of the delay might be a reflection of that,” Fainstein says. 
RELOCATION COMPLICATIONS
Community leaders are eager to move the project along.
“I feel very good about the current plan, and I think the residents do as well,” says Reverend Samuel M. Johnson, chair of the Charlesview board. “I think timing is more important than trying to tinker this or make it better.”
Ironically, Charlesview residents were once among the most vocal critics of the relocation plan.
The 213-unit subsidized housing complex, owned by Charlesview, Inc., an interdenominational faith-based, non-profit organization, was constructed in 1971 but has not been adequately maintained. Yet initial offers from the University for a land swap were rebuffed by the board and the residents. Even when the board voted in 2006 to accept an offer from Harvard for 6.25 acres of land where the Brighton Mills shopping center is currently located, residents remained dissatisfied, staging protests and charging that they were being excluded from the decision-making process.
In July 2009, the latest draft of the plan was submitted to the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which oversees the city’s development projects. Over half a decade had passed since the land swap idea was first introduced.
“I’m sure it seems painfully long for the Charlesview residents, when it’s been pretty clear that what they’re looking for is a decent place to live, a way to stay in the community, and [a way to] stay as a community,” says John Cusack, a North Allston resident and Task Force member. “It’s just that in order to do the best job you can, to get it as right as possible, you got to take your time. It’s horrible but you have to.” 
The additional land provided by Harvard in the latest draft allowed planners to reduce the total number of units on the site while increasing the number of actual buildings, replacing several larger, multi-unit buildings with smaller structures. Jacques says the development’s height and density, which had been one of the main concerns in the original plan, will now be comparable to those of its surrounding neighborhood.
All 213 affordable housing units from the original apartment complex will be accommodated at the new site, but 147 new mixed income units will be available for rental or home ownership. 
Although the market rate units will be somewhat separated from the subsidized residences, Fainstein says that the general level of integration included in the plan is probably sufficient. “Really mixing” the different types of residences, she says, may pose a marketing challenge for the more expensive units.
AVOIDING THE FRAY
Despite the revisions, some Allston residents say that the Charlesview relocation, tantamount to a major residential transformation at the heart of the local neighborhood, remains critically flawed. But even more disconcerting is the slender time frame they have to address their qualms: The community review process is slated to end in October—only three months after the Community Builders presented their revised plan. So far, only one public discussion has been dedicated to examining the plan.
The solution, some residents argue, is for the University to allow development on more of its Allston land holdings adjacent to the proposed Charlesview site—much of which currently sits vacant or has no explicit future institutional purpose. But Harvard has largely shied away from directly commenting on or involving itself in the planning process, preferring to allow the Community Builders and the City to wrangle over details. 
University spokeswoman Lauren Marshall, when asked whether Harvard is open to the possibility of providing more land for development or if it had other institutional designs for those plots, wrote in an e-mailed statement that the University has “had a productive discussion with Charlesview Inc.” and “remains respectful of the public review process that is underway.” 
Not everyone believes that more land is the solution.
“It’s easy to point to Harvard and say give more land, but maybe the Community Builders should try to develop this land in a different way,” says Paul Berkeley, president of the Allston Civic Association. “There’s no one person that holds the key.”
Shumaker, the BRA spokeswoman, says that the revised plan does address a number of the previous concerns, but notes that a third and final revision cycle is a possibility if the plan is not approved. Only after the public review process concludes, she says, will City planners know if the changes are adequate.
“Right now, our job is to review the project currently before us,” Shumaker says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kairos Shen, the popular chief planner for the Boston Redevelopment Authority, came to Allston last night intending to discuss long-term riverfront property development along Soldier’s Field Road. But at the community wide planning meeting, Shen quickly found his agenda derailed by a smattering of area residents. Aggressively, and at times angrily, they steered the discussion to what they denounced as the City planning agency’s botched handling of the Charlesview Apartments relocation—the “largest and most dynamic” change to the neighborhood in many years.“There’s this massive development that’s going to be dropped in the middle of the community almost without notice,” said Bruce E. Houghton, local resident and president of his namesake chemical corporation. which operates a plant in Allston. “Where was that going to be discussed?” Houghton, a member of the mayor-appointed Harvard Allston Task Force, said that the BRA had failed to critically examine the Harvard-sponsored plan to relocate hundreds of residents to an eight-acre swath of housing to be built in North Allston. Now, with the City on the verge of approving the project—the stipulated community input period comes to a close next month, and only one public meeting has been held thus far about the most recent plan—Houghton and other neighborhood activists say their concerns about proposed housing density, open spaces, transportation, and retail opportunities can wait no longer. And as is common during planning discussions in Allston, blame quickly shifted to Harvard as well.“Harvard University has been completely recalcitrant,” said local resident Brent Whelan. Like some other critics of the current plan, he said the proposal’s faults could be alleviated if the University would allow for residential development on more of its unused Allston land holdings. Until “Harvard is an actual participant” in the planning process, a viable agreement would be impossible to come to, he said.Harvard representatives sat nearly silently at the back of the room, with Kevin A. McCluskey ’76, Harvard’s director of community relations for Boston, interjecting that they had “looked at this session to focus on the community wide planning process,” not specifically Charlesview. —Staff writer Peter F.

NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Police and FBI agents searched the home of a Yale University animal research technician last night and led him away in handcuffs to the cheers of neighbors in a search for evidence that might tie him to the slaying of a graduate student.No charges were filed against 24-year-old Raymond Clark III in Middletown, but police took him into custody while searching for DNA and other physical evidence. Police said Clark would be released after they obtain evidence they need from him and his Middletown apartment.Clark was escorted out of the apartment building in Middletown and into a silver car. Neighbors leaned over the apartment building’s iron railings and cheered as police led him away.New Haven Police Chief James Lewis described Clark as a person of interest, not a suspect, in the death of 24-year-old Annie Le, whose body was found stuffed behind a wall in a campus research building Sunday, the day she was to be married. He said police were hoping to compare DNA taken from Clark’s hair, fingernails and saliva to more than 150 pieces of evidence collected from the crime scene. That evidence may also be compared at a state lab with DNA samples given voluntarily from other people with access to the crime scene.“We’re going to narrow this down,” Lewis said. “We’re going to do this as quickly as we can.”Police have collected more than 700 hours of video tape during the probe and sifted through computer records documenting who entered what parts of the research building where Le was found dead.Investigators began staking out Clark’s home on Monday, a day after they discovered Le’s body hidden in the basement of a research building at Yale’s medical school. She vanished Sept. 8.Clark shares the apartment with his girlfriend, Jennifer Hromadka, whom he is engaged to marry in December 2011, according to the couple’s wedding Web site.“He seemed like a normal guy to me, no big deal,” said Ivan Hernandez, 22, who lives directly above Clark and would often see him sitting on a bench outside their apartment building and smoking. “I thought he was nice, actually.”Neither the couple nor Clark’s parents returned repeated telephone calls Tuesday.Clark moved to Middletown from New Haven six months ago, where he shared an apartment with his girlfriend and three cats, according to former neighbor Taylor Goodwin, 16.“I never really talked to him much,” Goodwin said. “He was just some guy.”Police have said Clark is a lab technician at Yale. It’s unclear how long he worked there and Clark’s supervisors would not comment Tuesday.Le worked for a Yale laboratory that conducted experiments on mice, and investigators found her body stuffed in the basement wall of a facility that housed research animals. Clark works in the lab as a technician.Authorities had been tightlipped since Le was reported missing, just a few days before her wedding day. Police say they have ruled out her fiancee, a Columbia University graduate student, as a suspect but have provided little additional information.Officials had promised Tuesday to release an autopsy report that would shed light on exactly how Le died. But then prosecutors blocked release of the results out of concern that it could hinder the investigation.

Economist Marc J. Melitz has returned to Harvard this fall as a full professor after having left campus in 2006 for a two-year stint at Princeton. Melitz, who is well known for his research on international trade and firm-level responses to trade, was an assistant and associate professor at Harvard between 2000 to 2006. According to Economics Professor Ariel Pakes, Melitz “changed a whole field with his thesis” that presented a new model for international trade economics.Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell said that Melitz’s work has “paid direct attention to the way trade works asymmetrically” and has helped “connect trade theory with applied macroeconomics.” Campbell called Melitz an integral force in the “paradigm shift of the 21st century” in economics.This semester, Melitz is teaching Economics 1535: “International Trade and Investment,” a course he has taught before as an associate professor at Harvard. Shankar G. Ramaswamy ’11, who is taking the class this semester, described Melitz as “energetic” as well as “very accessible and patient.” Ramaswamy said that Melitz has given the course a strong “global perspective” and has “laid the foundation for some of the more specific models” that will be used later in the semester.Melitz has written two papers with International Trade Economics Professor Elhanan Helpman and is currently working with Pakes on research pertaining to international involvement in the growth of manufacturing in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall.“I had some very strong ties with colleagues here,” Melitz said, “It feels good to be back.” He added that he enjoys being back at Harvard “not so much based on working” with specific colleagues but rather on “day to day contact” with other members of the department.Melitz’s return adds to what Campbell called an “already outstanding group of international economists.” “I have had the amazing opportunity of being at two places, here and Princeton, that I consider two best places in the world to do work in trade,” Melitz said.Campbell said that he is glad Harvard “managed to lure [Melitz] back.” “There is no doubt we now have the best international economics department in the country. It’s a very exciting team,” he said.

The economic downturn has taken a toll on student workers across campus, limiting employment opportunities and forcing students to take shorter shifts at workplaces ranging from libraries to the Office of Career Services. Evelyn R. Wenger ’11, a student receptionist who has worked at OCS for the past two years, said that the maximum amount of hours each student can work per week has been reduced this year.Wenger worked between seven and ten hours each week last year, but she can no longer put in the same number of hours due to policy changes and new hour allocations, she said. “They did e-mail us prior to the beginning of the semester that they would probably be limiting our weekly schedule to 6 hours,” she said.Other employers are taking similar courses of action to deal with constricted budgets.Ilya E. Luvish, the production services coordinator at Sanders Theater who handles hiring each semester, said that Sanders decided to reduce the number of hours each student could work.“We’re not cutting back on how many people we hire, but we are cutting back on how many people will work per shift,” said Luvish. “We usually have twelve ushers per shift, but we’re considering going back to eleven.”Lewis B. Day, who is in charge of hiring for the technical services department at Houghton Library, is only hiring four students this semester. “We’re very mindful of hiring and the budget this year,” he said. Other employers said students who had previously worked for that employer would be preferentially asked to return first before new hiring takes place. “My department is not hiring any new students,” said Rachel Howarth, the associate librarian at Houghton Library, which usually hires new students each semester. “We just have a fair amount returning this year.”Some employers added that they are not taking work study eligibility into consideration when adjusting work schedules. Sanders, for example, hires both work-study and regular term-time student workers. “We definitely have more students that are non-work study,” Luvish said.Meanwhile Wenger’s attempts to assist others in finding a term-time job have yet to become successful. “I have referred people to OCS who were looking for jobs, but they have not been contacted by employers to the best of my awareness,” she said.

After four and half years of research and over 100 interviews, Cambridge resident Mo Lotman has published the first visual history of Harvard Square.Lotman—also the voice featured in American Express and Chrysler commercials—wrote and designed a 240- page book documenting the last six decades of Harvard Square. The book, called “Harvard Square: An Illustrated History Since 1950,” officially launched on Tuesday.“I love the area, and I have seen it change a lot over the years. I wanted to see it as I first remembered it, and as it was before I got here,” said Lotman. While looking through local bookstores for up-to-date histories of Harvard Square, Lotman could only find  “musty old things” and “children’s books.” When he was not able to find what he was looking for, he decided to create one himself, he said. Lotman then conducted interviews with local merchants, street performers, and Harvard graduates, including John H. Updike ’54 and former Mass. Governor William F. Weld ’66. When Albert R. LaFarge of the Albert LaFarge literary agency saw Lotman’s proposal, he said that he “instantly” knew that it should be published.“I believe every great book begins with a community,” LaFarge said. “There is a component of oral history that makes [“Harvard Square”] more than just an art book.”LaFarge said he quickly saw the book’s broad appeal. The Coop’s General Merchandise Manager Nancie E. Scheirer said she has seen tourists, locals, students, and parents purchasing the book. “We love it when we have books that are relevant to the community. We really believe it will sell,” Scheirer said.The Harvard Book Store set up a display in its storefront as well as inside the shop using photos from the book. Cambridge-centered displays are typically geared toward tourists, said Heather L. Gain, Harvard Book Store’s marketing manager. But Gain said she believes the display will attract Cambridge residents as well. Lotman, who was raised outside Philadelphia, fell in love with Boston when he visited as a 13 year old, he said. He moved to Cambridge in the early 1990s. “I felt like a relative newcomer [when I started the project], but people were impressed that I knew what I was talking about,” he said. “People wanted to share their experiences with me, and felt it was important that this book be written.”Paul Baranay, a junior at MIT, wrote an introduction to the segment of the book dedicated to the 2000s. Baranay was asked to write the introduction after Lotman read his description of life in Harvard Square on a MIT admissions Web site.“I never would have expected to be in this book. It is a very exciting project, an ambitious project and a vital one,” Baranay said. The Coop recently hosted the Harvard Square Business Association’s annual “Bookish Ball,” which included a giant cake featuring a picture of the book’s cover. Contributors and fans attended a launch party at Club Passim on Tuesday evening. The Harvard Book Store plans to host another event focusing on the book in December.Lotman does not have immediate plans for another book and will continue his work as a voice-over artist. Lotman said he initially hoped to update the book every 10 years, but he added, “Right now, 20 years sounds good. It was exhausting.”

It is a Saturday afternoon in early November. The Harvard football team is about to deliver a crushing defeat to Columbia in its last home game before Yale. The seconds tick away, and the buzzer sounds. The Harvard Fight Song echoes off of the columns of the ancient stadium. The stands are…empty? No, this isn’t a football quarterback’s version of one of those oh-my-god-I-went-to-school-naked nightmares. Sadly, this scene is a reality and one that is all too familiar to many Crimson athletes. As a cheerleader, I have been to more than my fair share of sporting events, and am almost always disappointed with fan turnout. While I prefer to eat, sleep, and breathe school spirit, this sentiment appears to be lacking from a majority of the student population, excepting Harvard-Yale weekend. This problem is especially apparent when you can identify random strangers on the street based solely on the fact that they were one of the eight members of the student section in last weekend’s basketball game. Due to these circumstances, few Harvard athletes have ever gained the rank of “campus celebrity,” and may feel underappreciated for their countless hours donated to the service of the crimson and white. After a week of morning lifts and getting your butt kicked at practice, the last thing one wants to hear is, “wait, we have a women’s hockey team?” Yet, although Crimson sports flies under the radar of many Harvard students, all is not lost. Surprisingly, the Crimson’s biggest supporters may be those who are most cut off by the Harvard bubble—the Cambridge community itself. This past summer, I had the experience of working with a summer camp near Central Square, my classroom populated by born-and-raised Cantabrigians. We went to the aquarium, ice cream shops, and the zoo; however, there was no place that my group of seven-year-olds loved more than Harvard Stadium. Shown around by a linebacker and an offensive lineman that looked more like giants than real people when compared to the under-four-foot-tall class, the children went on a tour and ran drills with the players. While the starts, tackles, and sacks of these two athletes may have gone unnoticed by a good portion of the Harvard population, with every lateral shuffle on that summer day, they became heroes. The conversation of that afternoon quickly morphed into a recreation of the kids’ first foray with the crimson and white, and the classroom soon became littered with big H’s drawn in red crayon. To the group of Cambridge youth, who may rival undergraduates in numbers on Allston-Brighton and Cambridge Day football games, the two players had just become local celebrities. While some may write off this interaction as simple children’s idolatry, the impact of Harvard athletics is even more evident on older Cambridge sports-lovers. One member of our summer program was a power athlete in his own right—a three-sport, competitive Varsity athlete while only a sophomore in high school. In the midst of a conversation about whether he would rather be recruited for collegiate basketball or football, and all of the amazing places that he could play, he stopped to ask about the Crimson team. However, his questions were not the ones that normally get asked by fellow students, such as “are we any good?” or “what actually happened at Harvard-Yale last year?” This high-school student, connected only to the Crimson by geography, threw out specific statistics and player names like a real Harvard sports baller. He finished up the conversation with eyes lit up and an insistence that he had to make it to more games this year. Being an athlete at one of the most competitive academic institutions in the country is a daunting task. Not only must you balance intensive studies with overwhelming practice schedules, but also there is little game day appreciation from fellow students for these achievements. Yet, the community as a whole may appreciate Harvard athletics more than we are aware. When Monday morning inconspicuously turns Friday night’s MVP into that random guy in section, to many Cambridge youth, the hero lives on. —Staff writer Alexandra J.

Most freshmen arrive in Cambridge with a vague sense that, in the career cartography of a Harvard student, all roads lead through Wall St. A small but extremely happy minority has proven otherwise. The National Basketball Association’s and Major League Baseball’s participation in last Friday’s Career Forum is a reminder that many alternatives to internships with investment banks, hedge funds, and consulting firms do exist. In fact, the students who have explored this option of working for a professional sports league recommend it highly. Senior Tommy Balcetis worked as an intern with the NBA last summer and found his experience more rewarding than many of his friend’s.“Everybody wants to get into I-banking and consulting,” he said. “If people love it, more power to them. But I feel like a lot of people go to those places to get the tools and analytical skills, but they didn’t really enjoy what they were doing. I genuinely enjoyed what I was doing, and I feel like I got a lot of similar tools from that experience.”Junior Michael Puopolo encountered a similar experience working for MLB.“I think it’s one of the coolest summer opportunities you could possibly have—both for the actual experience itself and the lifelong story—whether or not you have a long term interest in working in the sports industry,” he said.The NBA and MLB expressed similar delight with their relationship to Harvard students. “Harvard students tend to be well-rounded,” said NBA campus recruiter Heather Roberts. “You’re going to a great school, hopefully you’re maintaining a good GPA, but then there’s so much campus involvement at Harvard that you’re able to multitask.” MLB manager of recruitment Bridget Fialo concurred, “Harvard brings a certain caliber of person…We’re big fans.”But the mutual interest was not evident in student enthusiasm at the Career Forum.“Usually, there’s a line wrapped around my table, 100 and some people long. No joke,” Fialo said. “So I’m feeling a little less loved today, but I’m not taking it personally because there’s so many amazing companies here.”Fialo’s sentiments reveal a tension within campus recruiting. Although Harvard’s prestige attracts both a wide base of companies and high caliber firms, the glamour of the latter oftentimes negates the abundance of the former.“It’s not traditionally a career path that people have realized they can go into,” Roberts suggested.“You’re a fan of sports, but people don’t necessarily realize that can translate into a permanent, full-time position.”Fortunately for the NBA and MLB, their popular appeal invites passionate applicants. Love of the game, it seems, is almost a prerequisite for the job.“I grew up being a huge baseball fan,” said Puopolo, explaining his interest in the opportunity. “The vast, vast majority [of coworkers] were definitely [fans of baseball]. Their interest in the job centered around their interest in the sport.”Likewise, Balcetis found an outlet for his passion for basketball in his summer job.“I love everything there is to love about the NBA. How could you not? It’s the best sports league in the world,” he said. After three years of applying for the position, Balcetis’ persistence was rewarded, and he was granted an offer to work for the league. This enthusiasm for the organization made for a wholly satisfying experience. “It’s incredibly rewarding,” said Fialo of her own time with MLB. “There’s still some sense of wholesomeness and familiness to the game…It’s a company to be proud of.” Outside of personal satisfaction, employees found that, in fact, their experience had provided a useful platform for a career in any industry.“If you’re being interviewed, there’s a distinct possibility that people are going to be extremely interested in what you did,” Puopolo said. “You’ll have some interesting conversations, some interesting stories to relate.”—Staff writer Timothy J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students often wonder how Crimson teams would stack up against their counterparts from bigger, more sports-oriented universities. The Harvard women’s golf team is no different.Having conquered the Ancient Eight the past two seasons, the Crimson is setting its sights on regional and national competition this year as it aims for an unprecedented third consecutive Ivy League crown.“When we are able to compete against better teams, we get better ourselves,” captain Claire Sheldon said. “Our strength of schedule and ranking will also improve when we take on teams from outside the New England region.”Harvard’s first tournament of the year provided the team with the opportunity it was looking for—the chance to play with proven competition from around the country. This past weekend, the Crimson traveled to Las Vegas’ Paiute Resort Golf Club in Primm, Nevada for Golf Week’s Conference Challenge tournament, a three-day event taking place on the club’s Desert Course.The competition included a member university from conferences throughout the country, including University of California, Berkeley out of the Pacific 10 Conference and Ohio State University out of the Big Ten Conference.“We usually do not get the chance to play against that strong of competition,” said Harvard’s reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, sophomore Christine Cho. “This tournament gave us a good chance to compare our skills against schools that play a lot more golf than us against better competition.”Despite the stiffer competition, the Crimson more than held its own, as the team of five individual golfers finished in a tie for seventh place with the University of Nevada Las Vegas out of a field of 18 of the nation’s best  teams.Harvard tallied improving team marks of 310, 303, and 291 over the course of the three days, to finish the tournament 40 over par on the par 72 course. Pepperdine University the re[resentative from the West Coast Conference won the event with an overall mark of 17 over par.“We showed we can compete at a higher level against tougher schools,” Cho said. “This tournament was definitely a confidence booster for us.”Individually, Cho led the way for the Crimson, shooting rounds of 76, 76, and a one-under 71 on the final day, to finish the tournament tied for 18th out of the 89-player field. Junior Mia Kabasakalis placed 25th in the event, only one shot back of Cho with a final tally of 224.“I was able to find my swing after the first day, and my game got sharper after that,” Cho said. “My short game also helped out a lot.”Freshman Katie Sylvan finished the event tied for 28th place, with rounds of 79, 77, and a two-under 70 on the final day of competition, Harvard’s lowest round on the Desert Course. The highly-touted newcomer will be counted on significantly this year to step up and fill the void left by last year’s seniors, including four-time All-Ivy team member and 2006 individual Ivy League champion Emily Balmert.“Katie is probably going to be one of the best players in the Ivy League this year,” Sheldon said. “And after four years, she might be one of the best ever to come through the Ivy League.”Senior Sarah Harvey and Sheldon rounded out the Crimson contingent, finishing in ties for 43rd and 66th positions, respectively.“We showed that we can keep up with highly ranked teams and hold our own,” Sheldon said. “It was a great way to start the season.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

Ben Affleck was at Grendel's Den today shooting a scene for his new movie, "The Town," along with wife Jennifer Garner (FlyBy was a huge Alias fan.) and daughters Violet and Seraphina.
Parking was blocked off on part of Plympton Street to make room for the production crew, and a sign on JFK warned passersby that they may well appear in the movie inadvertently.

And just when you were considering going out and buying surgical masks...We're saved! UHS is now offering free flu vaccinations from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. every Monday and Tuesday until May 28!!!1!one
Except...this isn't the vaccine for the swine. You're only safe from regular seasonal flu.
In the event that you do want to avoid that (probably a good idea, FlyBy thinks), UHS ordered 19,000 doses of vaccine this year, up from 12,000 most years, says The Gazette. And anyone with a Harvard ID or a Harvard University Group Health Plan card can go claim theirs.
Sick! Yeah. We know. That was a terrible pun. Let the rush begin!

Police have taken 24-year-old Raymond Clark III into custody as the search for evidence continues in the killing of Yale grad student Annie Le, whose body was found Sunday stuffed into a wall of a university building.
More details here.
Sections
For those of you who missed it—or were too creeped out to go—FlyBy swung by the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine’s intro comp meeting last night, a smoke-filled affair that featured a bit of lore, a bit of hyperbole, and, well, a damn nice building (or at least part of it).
Prospective compers were ushered in through the door facing Claverly and into the building to the left. The corridor to the right that leads up to main part of the castle—yeah, the part where they throw the parties—was blocked off with a curtain and a bored looking staffer. Unfortunately, the details on that part of the castle will have to wait.
But the part of the castle we did see was admittedly a great throwback to the Lampoon’s founding days (roughly speaking), quite pretentious, and worth remembering.
Details after the jump.
This year’s sardonic lit comp directors Nathaniel H. Stein '10 and John B. Owen '10 led the meeting in a room in the part of the castle near Plympton Street. The room, a circular creation, featured book-lined walls—everything from a collection of bound Time magazines to a set of now-dead alumnus John Updike’s Rabbit, Run series. On top of the bookcases stood a collection of knick-knacks that included an empty bottle of Maker’s Mark—a FlyBy favorite—a bottle of peroxide, a pink Flamingo, and the Improper Bostonian’s 2008 award for “the party you weren’t invited to.”
Wide-eyed freshmen sat on the floor of the red-carpeted room while staff-writers perched on the windows and perpetually ordered everyone to squeeze in, a process akin to herding cats. All the while, members of the Lampoon stood around smoking in a room that was no more than 15 feet in diameter. Apparently putting up with a smoke-filled, claustrophobia-inducing room is a comp requirement. But while FlyBy could’ve used a smoke, none, it seemed, were in the offing.
The rest of the meeting proceeded with more smoking—take note compers, Mores seem to the Lampoon's cigarette of choice—and a litany of hyperbole about the checkered history of the magazine, its pranks, and comper contributions of their own pranks.
Some highlights:
The rest of the meeting proceeded much like most of the other intro-meetings of the pretentious literary magazines on campus, though with fewer pairs of horn-rimmed glasses than FlyBy would’ve like to see—only one by our reckoning.
Oh, and they were nice enough to serve beer, Bud Light to be precise. FlyBy gladly drank up.
Thanks for the beer, guys.

Yes, the Class of 2010 is one step closer to choosing which eight people will be charged with annoying them about alumni gatherings for the rest of their days.
Elections closed Monday at midnight, and the HAA has sent out the results to contenders for the Marshal position—which involves planning senior class activities, helping pick the Class Day speaker (please, God, don't give us Bernanke again), and interfacing with the Harvard Alumni Association to plan events in the years after graduation. 16 17 seniors made it past the first round of voting and will duke it out for one of the eight spots in a second round of balloting that begins tomorrow.

The Staples on the corner of JFK and Winthrop St. doesn't seem like it would be a lightning rod for controversy. But somebody seems upset: Earlier this week, an unknown protester plastered the wall outside Staples' door and the stairs leading up to the office supply store with signs that declared, "This Staples doesn't recycle."
Assistant Manager Wajeeh Anwar said he found the signs' appearance to be "a little hilarious" because, he said, Staples recycles all its paper, cartridges, cell phone batteries, and electronics.
"They wasted paper to do that," he noted, "but I recycled it."
That was easy.
The mysterious activist could not be reached for comment....

In case you were fortunate enough to miss it this week, Flyby's got the skinny on this lovely piece of spam that's been making the rounds, courtesy of some of your most random friends. Remember that guy who e-mailed you once for a section assignment last fall? He apparently wants you to see a photo!
The nuisance hails from a little site called Wegame.com. Heard of it? Probably not, unless you're one of the fools responsible for spamming hundreds of Harvard students with these e-mails.
More on the new digital scourge, after the jump.
The subject line reads: "[Sender's name] has sent you a photo!," to which the body reminds us "[Sender's name] sent you a photo. Want to see the photo?" Your turn! Click YES to let bad stuff happen to your computer, or click NO to let similarly bad stuff happen to your computer.
Isn't this how most spam works? Some idiot clicks the button and it shoots off emails to all his friends. Luckily, Wegame.com is even cooler. It actually requires you to SIGN UP. That's right--both the YES and NO buttons lead to a form at Wegame.com to convince you to sign up and register an account for the site. So how did you end up getting this email, then? Chances are... your genius friend probably signed up on Wegame.com.
Well, FlyBy's was intrigued, so we did some searching around on Wegame and it looked pretty harmless. Next to the "Name" field on the registration form, Wegame.com writes "Welcome to WeGame! What is your name? Keep it real :) " Smiley face = harmless. Just think Hannibal Lecter.
From a little bit of surfing, it quickly became clear that Wegame is just an Internet community of gamers who post screenshots and videos--pretty much a Youtube with a lot more World of Warcraft mods.
Then we stumbled across the ironically-titled "Privacy Policy":
And of course, if you do fall victim, you not only have to apologize for hitting your friends' inboxes, but you have to explain the whole internet gaming thing. Bonus.
