After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team finished its 2010-2011 season with a flurry of goals and wins, and its improbable late-season run nearly earned the squad a spot in the third round of the ECAC playoffs.
In tonight’s exhibition match against Western Ontario, the offense picked up just where it had left off.
In an impressive scoring display, the Crimson bested the visiting Mustangs in a 7-4 victory at the Bright Hockey Center.
“There are a lot of good things to look at [in this game], and certainly a lot of things to improve on if we want to have some success,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
The Harvard scoring onslaught began just minutes into the contest. After the teams traded shots early on, junior forward Marshall Everson received the puck near the red line with no one in front of him. In a one-on-one against Western Ontario goaltender Alain Valiquette, Everson came out on top, slipping the puck by Valiquette’s right foot to give the home team the early one-goal advantage.
But the first period scoring was far from over for Harvard.
Seven minutes later, junior forward Luke Grenier skillfully deflected a pass from sophomore defenseman Danny Fick past the Mustang netminder to double the Crimson lead.
And like at the end of last season, the Crimson power play was in high gear. With a one-man advantage at the 13:48 mark in the first, senior forward Alex Killorn, last year’s leading goalscorer for the Crimson, made it a 3-0 game.
Just a little more than 10 minutes later, early in the second frame, Harvard took advantage of the power play again, with junior Conor Morrison finishing off a strong Crimson passing display.
After Harvard tacked on another score just 1:24 later—giving the home team the commanding 5-0 lead—the momentum began to shift.
Western Ontario finally got on the board 7:23 into the period, when sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard couldn’t hold on to a Mustang shot, and Western Ontario forward Shaun Furlong pounded the rebound between Girard’s legs.
When Girard was replaced by freshman goaltender Stephen Michalek with 9:05 remaining—as was planned before the contest—the visitors took advantage.
In his first collegiate performance, Michalek struggled early on. In his nine minutes between the pipes in the second frame, the Mustangs found the back of the net three times, narrowing the score to 5-4.
“The second period got away from us a little bit,” Donato said. “We made some poor decisions with the puck, took some penalties, and turned the puck over a bunch.”
Harvard bounched back in the final frame. Michalek settled down, keeping the visitors off the board to assure the victory. And in the end, the Harvard offense—and its strong power play—proved to be too much for Western Ontario.
Twice in the final ten minutes, the Crimson found the back of the net, both times on power plays. With 10:37 left to play, Morrison snuck one past Valiquette. Just four minutes later, Killorn followed suit, finding the back of the net to earn his third point of the game and putting the contest out of reach.
“One of the things that really excited me was in the third period, after having a tough second [period], our power play came out and had a big goal—a timely goal,” Donato said. “We faced some adversity, and it was a nice opportunity to come out and have a good period, and I thought we did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After junior Colton Chapple threw five touchdowns to tie the Harvard all-time single game record last week, senior Collier Winters—named this week’s starter against Princeton—knew he would have to do something equally spectacular Saturday to make his case that he should be the team’s long-term answer at quarterback.
But there was only one way Winters could surpass Chapple’s five-touchdown performance: he’d have to score six times.
So he did.
Winters’ big day in his first start in five weeks helped him to reclaim his starting job and lead the Crimson to its fifth straight win, a 56-39 victory over a surprisingly resilient Tigers squad at Harvard Stadium.
“Our kids hung in there and found a way to win,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “It wasn’t the prettiest game, it was a very different game than what we were used to seeing from our defense, but it’s a team effort and we got it done.”
Princeton got on the board first early in the contest, moving the ball down the field in big chunks and scoring under two minutes into the game on a nine-yard touchdown run by freshman Chuck Dibilio.
Harvard responded on its next drive, with Winters capping a nine-play, 69-yard series with a one-yard touchdown run. On the subsequent Crimson possession, the senior led his team down the field in just 1:26, finishing the drive with a touchdown pass to sophomore wideout Matt Brown in the left corner of the end zone that Brown hauled in reaching back over his head.
“[Winters] didn’t look rusty or anything at all,” Princeton coach Bob Surace said. “Their receivers made some unbelievable catches.”
A Tigers field goal was followed by a Treavor Scales one-yard touchdown run for the Crimson early in the second quarter. On Princeton’s next possession, senior cornerback Brian Owusu chased down Tigers running back Brian Mills after a 48-yard scamper and punched the ball out from behind at the Harvard 24.
The Crimson regained possession on the fumble recovery by sophomore Chris Splinter, but Winters, on the run, badly underthrew an open Kyle Juszczyk for an interception along the left sideline to give the ball back to Princeton.
Neither team scored for the rest of the period, and Harvard went into the break up, 21-9.
In the second half, both teams exploded offensively, scoring six total touchdowns in the third quarter.
Just 1:12 into the period, Winters hit a wide-open Chris Lorditch—who finished with six catches for 101 yards on the day—down the right sideline for a 53-yard touchdown. After a Princeton three-and-out and an electric 42-yard punt return by freshman Seitu Smith III, Winters found senior Alex Sarkisian in the left corner of the end zone for another score.
“I prepared this week to come out and hopefully play up to my potential,” said Winters, who watched from the sidelines with an injured hamstring as Chapple threw 12 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in his absence. “I felt for the most part I did that today.”
Holding a 35-9 lead, the Crimson was in total control, but Princeton then started to fight back.
On the next Tigers possession, a 23-yard gain on a double reverse—Princeton tried multiple flea flickers and reverses on the afternoon—set the Tigers up at the Harvard two, and Wornham rushed it in to cap a 62-yard scoring drive.
Harvard scored again to go up, 42-16, on a Winters 17-yard screen to freshman Zach Boden.
But the Tigers scored two more times before the end of the quarter. After a 42-yard Dibilio touchdown run, Princeton succesfully executed an onside kick that the Harvard return team was not prepared for. On Princeton’s ensuing possession, a major breakdown in the Harvard secondary allowed Wornham to find a wide-open Matt Wilkinson for a 36-yard touchdown, and after a Wornham-to-Wilkinson two-point conversion, the Crimson lead was cut to 42-31 heading into the fourth.
“Princeton’s a great offense and we knew that coming in,” captain Alex Gedeon said. “There were missed tackles today, just fundamental breakdowns that weren’t happening in past games. Part of that was their pace, but a lot of it was they have good players and we weren’t getting in the positions we needed to make plays.”
In the final period, Wornham scored on a one-yard sneak under two minutes in, and another Tigers two-point conversion sliced the Crimson advantage to 42-39 with 13:09 to go.
But from there, the Harvard offense got back in its groove, with Scales scoring on a one-yard run after the running back had a key 17-yard pickup on 3rd-and-12 screen on the previous play.
Wornham was intercepted by captain Alex Gedeon on Princeton’s next drive—the fourth straight game in which Gedeon has been involved with a turnover—giving the Crimson the ball back in Princeton territory.
On a third-and-nine from the Princeton 27, Winters hit Sarkisian short of the marker along the right sideline, but the senior fought off a would-be tackler to pick up the first and keep the drive going. On his next pass, Winters hit sophomore tight end Cameron Brate over the middle for his fifth touchdown pass to put the game away.
“They’re a terrific team,” Surace said. “We’re trying to get to that level—they have a ton of talent, and it shows ... You’ve got to give them credit.”
The teams combined for 1,116 yards of total offense, as the Crimson gave up 267 yards on the ground a week after a dominant performance in which it allowed minus-five yards rushing to Bucknell. Junior linebacker Josh Boyd, who had 17 tackles for Harvard, was one of the few defensive standouts on either side.
Winters finished with 403 yards on 34-for-42 passing on the day—making him just the fourth Crimson QB to ever throw for more than 400 yards and the second to complete 34 passes in a game—and Harvard scored 40 or more points for three straight contests for the first time since 1932.
After the impressive performance, Murphy said Winters would be his starter moving forward.
“We certainly had a decision to make, but it really came down to this—Collier’s done a great job for us,” Murphy said. “He got hurt; he didn’t get beat out.”
Though 544 games took place between Harvard’s first five-touchdown passing performance—by Carroll Lowenstein in 1953—and Chapple’s last week, Winters needed just one contest to etch his name in the Crimson record books.
“There’s still a lot of things to work on,” the senior said. “But a win is a win, and I’m happy with that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its past two games, Harvard has scored 98 points. Its quarterbacks have thrown for 10 touchdowns, and in Saturday’s game alone the team had 560 yards of total offense.
But not everyone is a winner when the Crimson’s offense explodes. There’s probably only one group sorer than the football team right now: the Harvard cheerleaders.
As some of you may know, it’s fairly common practice for collegiate cheerleaders to a pushup for every point that the team has put up after every score.
And it’s not like they do just seven per touchdown. Any time the team puts points on the board, the cheerleaders have to do a pushup for every total point. So, for example, they would do seven after the first touchdown but 14 after a second touchdown, and so on.
You can probably figure out what 98 points means—more exercise than you might hope for.
The Back Page decided to calculate just how many pushups the cheer squad has done in the last two games.
We’ll start with the individual tally. Against Bucknell a week ago, the team put up 42 points on six touchdowns. So the numbers look something like this:
7 + 14 + 21 + 28 + 35 + 42 = 147 pushups per cheerleader
I’m afraid matters only got worse for them against Princeton, when Harvard once again put up huge numbers. The Crimson scored 56 on the afternoon, once again all on touchdowns:
7 + 14 + 21 + 28 + 35 + 42 + 49 + 56 = 252 pushups per cheerleader
Therefore, every cheerleader who worked both games did a whopping 399 pushups thanks solely to a prolific Harvard offense. Honestly, we’ll cut them a little slack if they cheated and didn’t go all the way down.
But how many total pushups did they do? By our count, there were 19 cheerleaders a week ago against Bucknell and 23 against Princeton, including a few children who picked a poor day to make a guest appearance with the cheer squad.
Using that information, you get the total number of pushups from the group:
(19 * 147) + (23 * 252) = 8589
That’s right. The cheerleaders did a collective 8,589 pushups in a week. If they wake up tomorrow and can do so much as move, I’ll be impressed.
And things might not be looking any better. The Crimson has scored more than 40 points in three straight games—the first time that’s happened since the Great Depression.
