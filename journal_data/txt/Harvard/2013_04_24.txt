After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week was a packed one for news junkies, as the both print and web media tracked stories about a failed gun regulation bill, a Texas fertilizer explosion, and Monday’s tragedy followed by Friday’s manhunt. Buried amid the mildly anarchic pandemonium was a lede quite different than the other tragedies and misfortunes—a proposal that will actually have a net positive effect on the world. A bipartisan group of four Republicans and four Democrats called the Gang of Eight released its plan for comprehensive immigration reform. This measure, whose full rollout has been delayed in the wake of the Boston bombings, pushes for a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s undocumented workers, a commitment to secure borders, and expansion of visas for workers proven to be beneficial to the country’s economy. We find this approach to be intelligent, pragmatic, and just.
It goes without saying that the state of American immigration system is shambolic. The nation is home to 11 million undocumented immigrants, a disagreeable situation that tears apart families and leaves many businesses in the lurch. The time for the United States to adopt sensible immigration policy is now.
The case for granting citizenship to the country’s aliens is well worn. A so-called amnesty plan is not just humane; it also promises to add currently maligned manpower to the sputtering economy. In fact, bolstering America’s economic backbone is a key factor in the Gang of Eight’s new initiative. The recently released proposal calls for the expansion of both merit-based visas and H-1B visas for skilled workers. The status quo, which amounts to a pernicious cap on the amount of skilled workers currently allowed entrance into the country, is one of the most overlooked retardants to economic growth. Each year only 65,000 workers are permitted to come here and fill holes in American businesses. If Congress and President Obama accept the Gang of Eight’s proposal, this number will thankfully increase to 110,000, with the potential to reach up to 180,000 depending on the demand for visas and the unemployment outlook.
Harvard has long been a fountainhead for support of immigration reform. President Drew Gilpin Faust is an outspoken leader in the campaign for the DREAM Act, which would provide citizenship for undocumented immigrants who attend college or serve in the armed forces. This makes sense. Harvard students will benefit from the inevitable economic boon that will accompany an increase in skilled labor. Sympathetic students will be able to sleep soundly after the newfound pathway to legal residency eases the plight of those living in fear of deportation. Harvard, like any other university, counts several such students among its undergraduates, and facilitating a way for them to contribute to our nation as American citizens is a smart move in the increasingly competitive global workforce.
We want America to succeed—to grow and prosper as it has done since its historic founding. We should not forget that this nation was settled by immigrants, founded by immigrants, and built by immigrants. We strongly believe that a thoughtful immigration policy is crucial to ensuring the continuation of American greatness. Last week’s announcement was a great first step. Hopefully, this measure does not follow the path of the Senate’s recent gun regulation imbroglio. In this case, it is absolutely necessary that reasonable governance triumph.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The best of government and the worst of government showed last week. In the wake of terrorizing shootings and nightmarish bombings, Boston summoned heroism. In the wake of Newtown and avalanches of gun violence, Washington mustered histrionics.
That the consummately professional and tirelessly effective law enforcement agencies working in Boston are overseen by such a disenchanting, dysfunctional, and disastrous bunch like Congress is unsettlingly uncomfortable, even beyond the usual cognitive dissonance endemic to Washington.
Selflessness is subordinated to selfishness.
One week ago, the Senate shamefully failed to pass legislation to renew an assault weapons ban, limit magazine sizes, illegalize straw purchasing and gun trafficking, and, most mind-bendingly, it failed to expand background checks.
The Manchin-Toomey bipartisan bill for sensible gun control reforms, with provisions supported by 90 percent of Americans, was too sanguinely hopeful for a return to the halcyon days when politicians put aside petty differences and party lines for the good of constituents. Nowadays 60 votes are needed to pass anything slightly more controversial than the deliciousness of apple pie. Consequently, most bills with bipartisan support are either insignificant or significantly terrible.
Of course, over 90 percent of those senators voting on the wrong side of history, empathy, or logic were Republicans—members of a party intent on continuing its own crucifixion despite grumblings for reform. As former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough sounded off, “this party is moving toward extinction.”
But Republican obstinacy and courageous stances against the will of American people are to be expected. It’s like the muted outrage whenever Ann Coulter vomits another hateful string of syllables—evil becomes banal. But it was always pointless to look to the Republicans for progress—the Democrats hold the fault for this failure.
Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and Majority Leader, squandered the chance to reform filibuster rules and reverse the increasingly anti-democratic dysfunction of the Senate, where 40 senators, who could represent less than one-fifth of the population, can hold up legislation indefinitely. President Obama proffered angry admonishments after the vote, but the energies spent in his eloquent eulogizing for the dead gun bill would be better spent in deft rather than disdainful negotiation with Congress.
Obama’s not-so-bully pulpit notwithstanding, expanded background checks would have been authorized had not four Democratic senators, cravenly fearing electoral rebuke, voted against them. Holding their National Rifle Association scorecards closer to their hearts than letters from bloodied and betrayed constituents, these Democrats epitomize everything wrong with Washington: unbridled duplicity for a few more years of self-absorbed self-importance.
What other than deluded self-interest can account for a Senate that can cast more votes for an amendment forcing all states to honor conceal-carry licenses from any other states than the amendment that would have expanded background checks?
Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat and chair of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, is one of the fantastic four Democratic senators voting against their party but for their pride. Baucus’s vote was thought to help him scramble a win in an upcoming race for his seventh term in a state Mitt Romney won by 13 points in 2012. But he announced yesterday that he would not seek another term, perhaps because of the liberal ire his record has drawn, making his vote even more baffling. Understandably, Baucus was scared—some people simply drop their values at first fright.
Despite being the architect of the Affordable Care Act, Baucus denounced his own bill as a “train wreck” while grilling Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. A veritable cottage industry of former Baucus staffers working as lobbyists has emerged on K Street, with hordes of lobbyists cajoling him into backing billions of dollars of savings for corporations. And then there was his shameful gun vote.
Between Baucus and Boston is a stark divide. The sycophantic senator quakes in fear of the NRA not liking him and so he runs for the hills. In Boston, first responders and ordinary citizens alike race forward to help.
When asked why he voted down the proposal, Baucus only gave one word, “Montana.” Were he truer, he might have said “re-election.” Were he completely truthful, he would have answered “spinelessness.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I sit here staring at a blank screen on my computer, and I can’t quite decide what I want to say. This is what I do on late nights these days: sit and think. It’s been a long week and I’ve had a lot of time to think.
I think back to last Monday afternoon, when I had learned of some sort of explosion, and, for a few hours, the whole event was a curiosity to me. I am almost ashamed to admit it, but the attack registered as nothing more than a news event in Boston.
And then the reports started pouring in, and everyone seemed to know someone that was there, either an eyewitness or a victim.
And then I learned that I, too, had friends that were at the marathon, and one who was burned by the blast.
And then I started to think back over my past 19 years. I don’t remember all that much from the 1990s. I’m supposed to be a ’90s baby, but my memory of Tamagotchis is pretty fuzzy. I never got into Power Rangers or Hey Arnold. In fact, I really don’t remember much of anything from the decade other than Dunkaroos and Nigel Thornberry’s nose.
But I do remember September 11. I remember when I first heard the grisly details. I remember being one of the last to get picked up from school. I remember sneaking in and watching the TV from the corner of the family room because it was a school night and television was strictly for weekends. I remember, some time later, being annoyed at having to take off my shoes at the airport.
But I can’t remember a time when I could leave my shoes on.
We were supposed to be perfectly safe, we suburbanites, protected by airport screeners and those wars abroad and successive presidents who put safety above all.
On Monday night, I went running outside, for the first time since fall. I was running to clear my head; I was running because running was all that was in my head after the marathon. Running was all I would let into my head. I ran down Mass. Ave. to MIT and looped back by the river. It was a pleasant route, and it wasn’t too cold. My playlist was old.
On Wednesday night, I went running again. I took the same route. Each time I ran past MIT, I wondered if I would run into my cousin, or anyone else I knew who lived down the road. I thought about the sidewalk, with all of its small potholes and large pedestrians. I hated my playlist.
On Thursday, at almost exactly the same time as I went running the previous night, I learned of shots fired at MIT. And then I learned of a robbery. And then a police officer shot. And then the police officer shot dead. And then a carjacking. All of which happened right on my running route. I was almost exactly 24 hours removed from the chaos.
And then I heard the sirens.
And suddenly, so suddenly, Boston became my city.
It’s during late nights like those that I get nostalgic for a time before all the madness, a time I frankly can’t remember. Why can’t we just turn the clock back fifteen years, to an era when the biggest threat to national security was a presidential blowjob?
The questions don’t stop. Why do they want to blow us up? Because it surely must be “us.” Who else? Who is “they?” What do they want? Would blowjobs suffice?
I then hang my head in shame, because at a time like this, all I can think about are crude jokes about blowjobs.
I couldn’t possibly pretend to know any of the answers. In fact, all I can offer are the words that I first heard in one of the Batman movies. Some men just like to watch the world burn.
But then I talk to my friends, the ones who went to high school with the terrorist. He was a normal, funny kid, they tell me. He liked his family. He liked practical jokes. He liked weed. Nobody knows what to say. The Jahar they knew isn’t a terrorist. He’s a classmate, a friend, a prom date. Terrorists don’t share bio notes.
Of course, we all know that Jahar, too, graduated high school in 2011. I can only imagine what his former classmates are going through. Who in my high school could be a terrorist? I can’t even begin to entertain that train of thought. We all went to prom. We all shared bio notes.
And so I sit here now, as the wee hours of the morning heralding the rising of the sun, and look at a screen filled with words. And I can’t quite decide what I want to say.
It’s been a long week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
In response to The Crimson’s coverage of the Harvard-Owned DoubleTree Suites hotel: I have been a room attendant for five years at the Harvard-owned DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston. The past five years have been very difficult for me. I work the afternoon shift, I am responsible for cleaning rooms, doing laundry, delivering items to guests, cleaning the lobby and the pool, and anything else my managers ask me to do. I never have enough time to complete my assignments in the evening, so I am always rushing. When I rush, I hurt myself. In the last five years I have hurt my shoulder, injured disks in my spine, and broke my nose at work.
When my back was injured because when I was pregnant, my managers continued to assign me the same workload. I was nine months pregnant and still doing difficult heavy labor. This injured my spine, and I still have back pain two years later. When it came time for me to go on my maternity leave, my supervisors pushed me to keep working. I worked until three days before my daughter, Arianna, was born.
One night when we were very busy, I was running to finish all of my work and slipped and hit my nose on a wall. When I called my supervisors to tell them what happened, the first question they asked was, “How many rooms do you have left to clean?”
I leave work every night tired and stressed. The next day all I want to do is rest. I don’t have the same patience I would like to with my daughters and husband.
I am asking Harvard for the same thing they have given their other employees: the right to a fair process to decide on unionization. I want to be treated like a human being, not just a pair of hands and a back.
Delmy Lemus
Boston, Mass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 25 Harvard employees and students gathered in front of the Holyoke Center on Tuesday afternoon to protest what they allege to be the discriminatory layoffs of three workers at University Financial Services.
The protesters marched in a circle in front of the Holyoke Center with signs bearing the slogans, “Harvard is not poor!” and “Harvard, don’t discriminate!”
UFS informed a group of employees in March of last year that they were entering a six-month period during which their work would be evaluated, according to a letter received by Sarah Tate, one of the notified workers who was later laid off.
“The next six months will be considered a transition period...your continuation in this role...is contingent upon your work performance and skills development meeting the needs of your expanded role,” wrote Human Resources Officer Michelle A. Roach in a letter to Tate.
Geoffrey P. Carens, a library assistant who is two of the laid-off workers’ representative in the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said that the workers were evaluated based on their speed of completing assigned work. He alleges that UFS did not lay off Caucasian workers who performed at a slower rate than the two workers he is representing.
Bill Jaeger, the Director of HUCTW, declined to comment on the allegations of discrimination.
Both of the laid off workers present at the rally emphasized their hard work and dedication to the University.
“I have been here ten years, loyal, working through vacations and when they call an emergency situation,” Tate said. “What offends me most is that there is no doubt in my mind that my performance level was great.”
The University does not comment on personnel matters, according to a University spokesperson in an email to The Crimson.
However, the spokesperson highlighted Harvard’s employment policies, which state, “in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and local ordinances, the University does not discriminate in the terms and conditions of employment”.
Carens said that the goal of the protests is to get the employees rehired.
“This is likely going be an ongoing campaign because management has so far shown absolutely no willingness to bend on their position that these people were laid off because they were too slow,” Carens said.
The protest was the third action this year on behalf of the laid off workers. Carens said that the group plans to hold a protest at Commencement in May if their allegations are not addressed by the University before then.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before an audience of over 400 packed in Emerson Hall Tuesday evening, former world No. 1 tennis player Andre Agassi shared stories of his experiences in tennis and his strategies for overcoming challenges he faced.
At the event, organized by the Leadership Institute at Harvard College, the eight-time Grand Slam champion and Olympic gold medalist reflected on the challenges he faced during times of personal turmoil and recounted the journey that led him to be the person he is today.
“When you hit a wall, you’re going to get tired,” Agassi said. “And when you do, you need to control what you can and find a way to let go of what you can’t.”
Agassi applied this mentality to students at the College, urging them to push through despite whatever they may think is holding them down.
“You all sit in a rare seat. Your discipline, perfectionism, courage, you’ve shown these things for many years and that’s why you’re here. My hope for you is when you feel overwhelmed, allow yourself to be a work in progress,” Agassi said.
Apart from his successful tennis career, Agassi was also invited to speak because of his significant philanthropic work.
In 1994, Agassi founded the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education, which to date has raised over $177 million to support public education for underserved youth.
Wesley A. Friedman ’16, a member of the Leadership Institute who organized and moderated the event, said he was extremely satisfied with its outcome.
“Andre did an incredible job of getting his message across to the audience,” Friedman said. “It’s hard to find people willing to talk about their life in a raw and honest way. I couldn’t think of a more perfect leader to speak to us.”
Agassi detailed his rise, fall, and subsequent return to the top of the tennis world while battling personal demons along the way.
After rising to the world No. 1 ranking in 1995, Agassi’s career seemed to be on the decline. By 1997, he had sunk to No. 141, as he battled a wrist injury and growing drug addiction that year.
But Agassi said that driven by his desire to play only for himself, he gradually began a comeback, and by 1999, Agassi had reclaimed the top ranking.
“It wasn’t about me achieving anything, it was about me wanting a journey and embracing it, whatever the ups and downs were,” Agassi said.
Nicholas M. Folger ’15, who also helped organize the event, was delighted with Agassi’s talk and how the event turned out.
“Andre is truly a genuine role model,” Folger said. “He portrayed that to everyone tonight, and Wesley also did an excellent job moderating.”
Looking forward, Agassi said that every experience leads you to the next step in life.
“The next stage is most important,” Agassi said. “Trust yourself. You have the tools to take a step closer to your goals. Think about what you want to do and enjoy that, the good and the bad.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For nearly 20 years, computer science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83 taught the course Computer Science 161: “Operating Systems” in a conventional lecture format.
But teaching from the front of an auditorium that—especially after lecture videos became available online—held dwindling proportions of the enrolled students did not seem to be the most effective use of class time.
As a result, Seltzer decided to experiment with “flipping the classroom” this semester. For a third of the course, Seltzer is providing material in pre-recorded lessons for students to watch online, and instead using the two weekly 90-minute sessions for group work, coding exercises, and class discussions.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences classes have promoted group work in the classroom for years, but the flipped classroom method goes a step further by moving the traditional lecture out of the lecture hall. Several other CS professors say they are considering how to adopt the concept to address a lack of attendance in their own courses.
Now, as SEAS anticipates a move to more spacious quarters in Allston, computer science professors may soon have access to the spaces necessary to grow the flipped classroom model. But professors acknowledge the virtue of the traditional lecture format, and say there are fundamental limitations to scaling the model for larger courses that cannot simply be overcome with more physical class space.
“A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT”
In spring 2012, computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 first introduced the flipped classroom to SEAS in his new course Computer Science 20: “Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science.” In a course for concentrators who lack mathematical background, Lewis said the method of “coached problem solving” is particularly effective.
“What we really want to teach people is not so much facts, but how to think about approaching problems and solving them,” Lewis said.
One year later, Lewis’s idea is beginning to catch on. A Tuesday afternoon in a CS 161 class finds Seltzer’s students working in pairs to download the code for a new problem set and analyze one of the functions in detail.
With the students spread across the room in tables of four, Seltzer and the course’s three teaching fellows wander around taking questions, occasionally pulling up one of the six movable whiteboards in the room to illustrate a concept.
Seltzer said that the new format fosters greater engagement and a sense of community among herself, students, and the teaching staff.
“In a traditional lecture, when you try to get interactive conversations going, the people who are most in control and most comfortable with the information are those who are most likely to answer questions and engage,” Seltzer said. “In the flipped classroom...the groups that are struggling and that actually need help, those are the ones with which the TFs and I are engaging.”
Yaniv Yacoby ’15, a student in CS 161, said that sitting in a flipped classroom encourages him to think critically about the material.
“It allows you to think for yourself and figure out exactly why existing infrastructures are in place instead of receiving information exactly as it is,” Yacoby said. “I thought it was very, very effective.”
FILLING SEATS IN CS
In a concentration in which students sometimes skip class to watch online lecture videos at their leisure, the flipped classroom model may offer a way to boost attendance—an issue that has become even more pressing as SEAS prepares to move even further away from the center of campus.
Currently, attendance in many computer science classes ranges from one-half to two-thirds, according to various professors who are teaching lecture-based courses this semester. Computer science professor David C. Parkes, who teaches CS 186: “Economics and Computation” and records lecture videos, wrote in an email that around 30 of the enrolled 43 students show up on a given day.
“I think that we, as faculty, should be organizing lectures in a way that, for most students, it would be a mistake not to attend class,” Parkes wrote. “We can do this by making lectures interactive, and by encouraging reading in advance of class.”
But Seltzer estimated that attendance in CS 161 is around 75 percent—higher than previous years—which she directly attributes to the implementation of the flipped classroom model.
“People have done fine in 161 skipping lectures,…but this year, the attendance has been great,” Seltzer said.
Although decisions have not yet been made about where SEAS courses will be held following the Allston move, computer science professor John G. Morrisett, who teaches Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II”, said that he expects large courses like CS 50 and CS 51 to remain in Cambridge.
Although moving the class across the river may take a toll on class attendance, Morrisett said that if the new buildings in Allston were outfitted with classroom space that promotes working in small groups, students might actually be more excited to go to class.
“One of the things I would love to do for [CS] 51...is think about flipping the classroom, at least part of the time, and do more hands-on programming in the time that we have together,” Morrisett said. “I think some of the new space that we’re talking about in Allston could enable that.”
Morrisett added that the decision of where to hold classes will be a process of continual experimentation.
“I think we’ll have to play around with it and see, will students come, or will they not?” Morrisett said.
GROWING PAINS
Despite the flipped classroom model’s successful implementation in two CS courses and interest in expanding its use in the classroom, instructors said there are still challenges in designing a course around the new format.
Lewis said that while the flipped classroom method integrates well with the content of CS 20, it might be less successful in other situations.
“I don’t think this style lends itself so well to a course where you’ve got to develop a complicated argument that requires a lot of explanation and synthesis on the part of the instructor,” Lewis said.
In addition, senior lecturer on mathematics Paul G. Bamberg ’63, who is currently teaching CS 20 while Lewis is on sabbatical, said it takes extra effort for an instructor to prerecord lessons and come up with sample problems for each class.
Seltzer also brought up the possibility that the flipped classroom model could overburden students with preparation work on top of their already heavy assignments.
Yet instructors and their students agreed that the biggest challenge behind flipping the classroom is adapting the model for a significantly larger class size.
“In terms of [the instructor] being a highly visible presence while people are working on the problems, 12 tables is pretty much the limit,” Bamberg said.
Bamberg said he thinks the upper limit on a flipped classroom is around 50 students—to teach more than that, a class would have to be split up into different sections.
Currently, there is no interactive class space for larger courses among SEAS’s lecture halls. Both CS 161 and CS 20 are held in Pierce 301, a newly-renovated interactive classroom which seats 50 students.
Although SEAS will have the opportunity to design similar classrooms in Allston, there remain problems in scaling the flipped teaching model that go beyond the sheer amount of room available. Seltzer said that she was “struggling” to envision the model working for a class as large as CS 51, which has more than 200 students.
“What would a classroom look like where you could actually have that many people but still have the small group interaction in a pretty seamless way?” Seltzer asked. “I don’t think just taking [Pierce] 301 and making it four times bigger is the right answer.”
Although there may be challenges to applying the model to other courses, Seltzer said she hopes other professors explore the benefits of using a flipped classroom.
“I don’t think it comes as any surprise that there are ways that work better [than lecturing],” Seltzer said. “I am shocked at just how exciting I found it and how dramatic it was.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a speech that drew mixed reactions from an audience of about 30 Allston-Brighton residents, Romance Languages and Literatures Professor Doris Sommer described art’s potential for social empowerment both in the community and internationally at the Allston Education Portal Tuesday evening.
Sommer recounted anecdotes of “cultural agency” in history, specifically former Bogotá mayor Antanas Mockus’s citywide initiative in the late 1990s and early 2000s to promote creativity in a city ravaged by drug violence.
Sommer described the journey that led her to the discovery that she, too, could be a cultural agent—someone who finds solutions to social problems through the arts rather than through politics.
“We live in a world where we’ve somehow bought the idea that pleasure is a distraction, that it’s almost sinful,” Sommer said. “One thing we all learned from Mockus is that pleasure is crucial in creating social change.”
According to Sommer, that change comes about when citizens are empowered through the creation of art.
Sommer’s lecture was part of PRE-Texts, a program within the University’s Cultural Agents Initiative that Sommer developed to integrate the arts into the academic environment.
This past year, PRE-Texts brought together undergraduate mentors and students at the Gardner Pilot Academy—an elementary school in Allston—to promote critical thinking and a love of learning.
Despite their acknowledgment of the success of Harvard-sponsored programs locally, some residents questioned their effectiveness.
John J. Stenson Jr. of Brighton asked the first question after Sommer wrapped up her lecture, demanding to see funding from the University to promote theater in Allston.
“Never mind about Bogotá. What about right here?” Stenson said. “Put a play on here. That’s your challenge.”
In an interview with The Crimson following the lecture, Stenson explained why he considers theater such an important educational tool.
“When you go and you see the manifestation of sacrifice and suffering, you understand something about yourself,” he said. “It purges you of arrogance...hopefully.”
Robert A. Lue, life sciences professor and faculty director of the Ed Portal, said that he hopes to speak with Stenson to discuss putting a show on at the Portal.
“It’s something we should really think about doing,” Lue said. “This space is for the community.”

Following outcry over a Harvard Kennedy School faculty committee’s decision not to promote lecturer Dean Williams—whose two courses on leadership are critical to the school’s practical curriculum, students say—the Kennedy School Student Government will request a meeting with administrators to discuss the decision and its implications for the school’s educational mission.
The KSSG said that the move to not grant senior lecturer status to Williams, who specializes in teaching applied skills, undermines the Kennedy School’s status as a professional, rather than research, institution—a sentiment echoed by a petition signed by 497 Kennedy School students and alumni.
Williams, who was offered a part-time contract for the 2013-2014 school year, teaches one section of Management, Leadership, and Decision Sciences 201: “Exercising Leadership: The Politics of Change” and MLD 202: “Exercising Leadership: A Cross-Cultural & International Perspective.”
According to the petition, MLD 202 will no longer be offered when Williams moves to a part-time position. The petition also expressed concern that if Williams leaves the Kennedy School in the following year, the number of seats available in MLD 201 will be cut in half.
Harvard Kennedy School spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson declined to comment on the petition, citing the school’s employee privacy policy.
According to Ronald Heifetz, the other lecturer for MLD 201, the course is consistently rated the most influential class at the Kennedy School by alumni. In the spring of 2013, 177 students lotteried for just 104 seats in the course.
At a meeting Tuesday night, KSSG members agreed to draft an open letter requesting that administrators meet them for a discussion of the future of MLD 201 and 202, adaptive leadership at the Kennedy School, and the Kennedy School’s status as a professional school. The letter will lay out a time frame for decision-makers to respond.
Should the administration not reply by the deadline, KSSG is planning to take alternative measures, including contacting national media and asking that alumni earmark capital campaign donations for adaptive leadership courses and lecturers.
Before discussing their plan of action, the KSSG heard from Heifetz about leadership-oriented curricula at HKS. Heifetz backed students’ concerns about the Kennedy School’s dedication to leadership curricula, saying that when Williams took a leave from the school to pursue field work, the Kennedy School initially planned to offer only one section of MLD 201. He said that it was only after his intervention that the school offered the second section.
Heifetz also said that the Kennedy School administration’s hiring process has contradicted the school’s professional mission by favoring researchers and academics over government practitioners. According to Heifetz, the school’s lack of commitment to leadership and other practice-oriented classes is evident through a lack of training for instructors of these courses, as well as the fact that the Kennedy School has no tenured faculty in these fields.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After coming under fire last week for a Microsoft Excel error and what have been called unconventional research methods in a prominent 2010 macroeconomics paper, Harvard Kennedy School professor Carmen M. Reinhart and economics and public policy professor Kenneth S. Rogoff are continuing to defend their research, saying that despite one mistake, their core conclusions remain unchanged.
In their study, entitled “Growth in a Time of Debt,” Reinhart and Rogoff found that when the size of a country’s debt exceeds 90 percent of its gross domestic product, economic growth slows dramatically. The paper has been cited extensively by policymakers—including Olli Rehn of the European Commission and U.S. Representative Paul D. Ryan—pushing for major budget cuts in Europe and the United States.
But on April 15, a trio of researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, published a paper that found fault with three aspects of the Harvard researchers’ influential study. The Amherst researchers discovered that Reinhart and Rogoff had made a basic coding error in Excel that undermined their key calculation of average GDP growth in nations with high levels of public debt. The Amherst researchers also took issue with Reinhart and Rogoff’s methodology, which omitted several years of data for some countries in the sample and assigned equal weight to all of the nations analyzed in the study.
In a response published the next day, Reinhart and Rogoff stood behind both their research methodology and their results before acknowledging the Excel error in a second statement a day later.
“We are grateful to Herndon et al. for the careful attention to our...paper and for pointing out an important correction,” they wrote in the second statement. “It is sobering that such an error slipped into one of our papers despite our best efforts to be consistently careful. We do not, however, believe this regrettable slip affects in any significant way the central message of the paper.”
Reinhart and Rogoff wrote that they “object to in the strongest terms” the Amherst researchers’s claim that Reinhart and Rogoff “selectively omitted” data in their sample, saying that they had left out certain years from their data set because data for those periods had not yet been constructed. In response to the charge that Reinhart and Rogoff’s equal weighting of all countries exaggerated their results, the Harvard researchers explained that they had used this method to avoid disproportionately weighting countries that may have experienced specific peculiarities.
Rogoff wrote in an email to The Crimson that he and Reinhart are currently writing a third response to the criticism that they expect to release sometime this week.Princeton professor and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has published several articles sharply criticizing Reinhart and Rogoff’s response to the Amherst researchers’ critique. He called their first response “disappointing” and “evasive,” and the second one “disingenuous.”
But Henning Bohn, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, expressed sympathy for Reinhart and Rogoff, saying “anybody can make a little error.” He credited the two Harvard researchers for their “transparency” throughout the dispute.
When asked about the implications of the Excel error, Bohn explained that the slight changes in the numbers did not faze him.
“This little glitch should not detract from the main message of their research,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was a theme of “hope” at the Institute of Politics Tuesday night, as United States Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter detailed a plan for how the United States can make the transition from a war-burdened economy to one that fosters peace and international cohesion.
Carter began the forum by briefly addressing the recent Boston Marathon bombings and the sense of loss yet hope that resulted through community support.
“If there is anything good about being in a war for 10 years is that we know a great deal,” Carter said.
In his talk, Carter addressed the steps the United State would have to take to “turn a corner from that era dominated by [the wars in] Iraq and Afghanistan, towards the challenges and opportunities that will define the future of our security.”
Carter advocated cutting wartime spending by slimming down the military while keeping and redistributing the technology and resources acquired over the course of the two recent wars.
“We only deserve the amount of money that we need and not the amount of money that we’ve gotten used to,” Carter said.
To curb defense spending, Carter brought up the war in Afghanistan, where the end goal of American involvement was simply to maintain security, he said.
“[The goal is] not to end it, but to wind that war down,” Carter said.
Carter noted that President Obama has requested that the American military make the transition from a large, rotational, counter-insurgency force to a leaner, more flexible, and utility-based force.
The final step in Carter’s plan is to shifts its budgetary and strategic outlook to the Asia Pacific region.
Through winding down current wars, concentrating the military, and reclaiming many of the resources and capital used in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. Department of Defense can regroup and reallocate those supplies to the Asian Pacific for defense, humanitarian efforts, and disaster relief. Carter said he believes that American presence and post-war rebalancing in Asia will be welcomed by most countries, including China.
Will Shih ’16, who attended the event, said that Carter’s plan to pivot towards the nation’s relationships with Asian countries was “the best.”
“He said the most important stuff when he was talking about setting new priorities and moving forward in the future,” Shih said.

With next week’s primary election looming, Massachusetts politicians vying to fill the state’s open U.S. Senate seat found themselves grappling with an uncomfortable question this week: how soon is too soon to get back on the campaign trail after a devastating tragedy?
“It’s a very awkward feeling,” U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston told reporters after a debate Monday night, referring to his decision to resume his senatorial campaign just days after the Boston Marathon bombings. “But we’ve got an election in seven days so we’ve got no choice.”
Lynch and his competitors all immediately suspended their campaigns out of respect for the victims of the April 15 bombings. With little time left to sell their message to voters, they are now returning their full energies to their campaigns after staying off the trail for much of last week.
State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow, a Repubican from Norfolk who is running against two other Republicans in the GOP primary, told The Crimson that he chose to resume his campaign “out of respect for the democratic process and to say that we wouldn’t let the attackers undermine that process.”
But with the deadly attacks and their aftermath still on voters’ minds, candidates must walk a fine line in the final few days before the primary to avoid alienating voters.
U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of Malden, the frontrunner who is facing off against Lynch for the Democratic nod, said that going forward, the candidates will hold their tongues in order to uphold the close-knit feeling in the Boston community.
“We’re going to be as respectful as we possibly can in order to ensure that nothing that we do jars with the civility that people are going to expect over the next week in this campaign,” he said during the Monday debate.
But despite this promise, Markey and Lynch attacked each other’s voting records on homeland security issues during both Monday and Tuesday’s debates.
Lynch and Markey agreed, however, that strict national security policies are necessary to prevent such an event from occurring again.
Lynch said that after a traumatic incident, Bostonians look to the government for “that basic level of protection.”
Candidates vying to replace longtime Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino also suspended their political activities in the aftermath of the bombings. They too have since resumed their campaigns.
Though that election is not until November, the mayoral race had been heating up in the weeks leading up to the attacks. A handful of politicians had formally announced their candidacies in the weeks prior to the bombings, with several more said to be considering a run.
Community organizer Bill Walczak, another mayoral candidate, wrote in an email to The Crimson that he would refrain from prescribing policy in the wake of the tragedy.
“I will leave security proposals to the security experts,” Walczak said. “We need to trust those who do this for a living, especially as the investigation is ongoing.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 26, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the context in which U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch talked about his decision to resume his senatorial campaign just days after the Boston Marathon bombings. In fact, he made his remarks while speaking with reporters after a debate on Monday, not during the debate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since 2010 the Harvard men’s soccer team did not host a spring exhibition game in Harvard Stadium. Gone is former coach Carl Junot, who resigned in January, and gone with him is the tradition of playing international friendlies in support of global health initiative Partners for Health. The Crimson took on Haiti and Cape Verde last spring, besting the Haitians, 1-0, and falling to Cape Verde in penalty kicks.
In Junot’s place is the newly hired Pieter Lehrer, a long-time Cal assistant who was named head coach earlier this month, and Lehrer has opted instead for a pair of exhibition matches against Boston University and Boston College.
“With the whole transition [between coaches] we understood it would be tough to schedule these high-profile games with so much up in the air,” junior midfielder Kevin Harrington said. “The athletic department has just been committed to making sure we have our feet under ourselves, making the right decision with a new coach. Coach Lehrer has done a great job scheduling these games against high-quality opponents—opponents just as good as Cape Verde and Haiti. It’s not as high profile, but it will certainly push us to improve.”
The Crimson took on the Terriers Tuesday night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium just two weeks after Lehrer took the reins, and lost 2-1 after jumping out to a 1-0 first-half lead.
“We only had one or two subs and guys got tired,” Harrington said.  “In the second half, they took it to us and ended up winning. It’s only an exhibition game, but we still would have liked to have gotten a victory.”
Harrington opened the scoring when freshman midfielder Andrew Chang forced the ball up towards the BU goalkeeper. The ball bounced around the box and fell at Harrington’s feet before he buried it in the back of the net. The Terriers came back with a late first-half equalizer before taking the lead in the second period.
Despite the loss, the Crimson is optimistic that the coaching change marks a turning point as the program tries to bounce back from consecutive last-place, winless, finishes in the Ivy League.
“He’s been everything we could have hoped for so far,” Harrington said of his new coach. “He is a disciplinarian, but he’s got a great mind for soccer and has helped our whole system offensively, defensively; the whole package seems to really be working.  We couldn’t be happier with him so far. It’s going to take a while to recover from the last two seasons, but he’s injected optimism which is what we need more than anything: belief that we can achieve the goals we set for ourselves.”
In former co-captains Scott Prozeller and Richard Smith, and classmates Brian Rogers and Zack Wolfenzon, the Crimson is losing four key contributors to graduation this offseason. With a new coach, a new system, and new players forced into key positions, Harrington is more concerned with the bigger picture than Tuesday’s disappointing result.
“We’re really optimistic in a way we haven’t been in recent years,” Harrington said. “We’re really excited to improve and surprise some people next season.”
The Crimson plays Boston College on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a campus with the most varsity sports in the country, it is easy to overlook the achievements of certain teams. For example, let’s take a random team—call it Harvard team X—and let’s look at what it’s done in the past couple seasons.
Team X won an Ivy League title last year. A solid start in and out of the conference buoyed expectations for a team that people didn’t expect to be better than last year’s squad.
If you think Team X is Harvard football, close, but no cigar.
In the last two years, Team X made a historic entry into the top 25 and rode a wave of momentum to upset a top-25 team in regular season tournament play. The 2012-2013 version of Team X has only one main senior contributor, with freshmen and sophomores carrying the team.
Team X won its first five conference games of this season and its biggest conference rival is Princeton. The last time it played in the NCAA end-of-season tournament, it upset a big state school in the first round. The easy answer here might be Tommy Amaker’s squad, but this isn’t another men’s basketball column.
Team X is actually men’s tennis. Coach Dave Fish has built a dominant team in 2013, one that is worthy of your full support as the calendar turns from April into May.
There are plenty of storylines to choose from with this team. Currently on a 12-game winning streak, the team has a good chance to finish the Ivy League season undefeated and win the league outright. Last spring, the team graduated four seniors that led the team to a second round loss in the NCAA tournament; nine of the twelve players on this year’s roster are either freshmen or sophomores. The team’s one senior, Andy Nguyen, has the best record on the team at 22-7 and is part of the team’s second best doubles lineup. More importantly, Nguyen has stepped up when the team needs him most, winning 75 percent of his matches when asked to play at the second or third line.
The team’s diverse playing styles means there is something for everyone to like. Sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri grinds down opponents from the baseline and covers the entire court with extraordinary speed. Freshman Kelvin Lam, already a key contributor, attacks with rocket forehands, deft volleys, and crafty net play. For fans of quick points and big serving, the team’s doubles play—which has improved drastically over the course of the season—is superb. Junior Casey MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen run like a well-oiled machine, having won 13 of their 15 matches together, including all contests during the team’s 12 game winning streak.
The team only has two matches left in the regular season, but could be prepared for a long tournament run. Sitting at number 22 in the country, the Crimson will likely be favored in their first round match and have an outside chance of being favored in their second. Being dominant at the doubles position means that Harvard only has to get a split in the six singles matches to get the win, another huge advantage for the team.
Living in the relative obscurity of the Murr Center, which doesn’t have the glitz and glamor of Harvard Stadium or even Laivetes Pavilion, it’s easy to ignore the achievements of this team. But for a team that has been just as, if not more, successful than Harvard’s major two sports, it’s time to start paying attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard baseball team’s season draws nearer to a close with conference play ending this weekend, three sophomore players stand out this year.
Sophomores Brandon Kregel, Tanner Anderson, and Mike Martin have stepped up this season, excelling both offensively and defensively for the Crimson.
“When they’re in the lineup and when they come up [to bat], you expect them to come through every time, unfortunately, because they’ve done it so many times now,” co-captain Robert Wineski said. “They’re definitely a spark to our offense. They’ve worked really hard to prove their game, and I think it’s really paying off right now in the season.”
Kregel leads the offense with 43 hits and 18 runs batted in and has hit a total of 11 doubles this season. Remarkably, the sophomore is still in the process of fully overcoming injuries from the previous year.
“I couldn’t play at all last year,” Kregel said. “So just working to get back my swing has been a huge part of this year. I’m still, believe it or not, working on it and trying to trust myself that I can swing through the ball and not have to worry about re-breaking [my wrist] or anything.”
In addition to being a key hitter, Kregel also plays right outfield for Harvard.
“[Brandon] is not a selfish player,” Wineski said. “He’s a very team-oriented guy, and he’ll do anything he can to help the team out…he’s rocking right field, haven’t had to move him all year.”
Martin also powers the Crimson offense with 28 hits, eight doubles, and two triples. Defensively, the sophomore has tallied 46 assists and 48 putouts.
“Mike is obviously a very talented player all around,” Wineski said. “He’s really fast, got a lot of pop, hits per average…he can lay a bunt down and beat it out. He can steal a base. He’s really just a dynamic player. Mike’s a great shortstop, great range, good arm.”
Somehow, Martin is producing hits while making the transition from outfielder to shortstop.
“It’s been really interesting to see [Mike] transform from a centerfielder to a shortstop,” Kregel said. “The entire season he’s been battling a groin injury, but just seeing him out there working as hard as he can just really shows how much of an athlete he is.”
The third key contributor, Anderson, is a versatile player. He has started as pitcher in five games this season in addition to being a key defensive player at second base.
“We’ve taken every opportunity and advantage of any kind to get down there, whether it be hitting in the cages, picking groundballs, picking fly balls, stuff like that,” Anderson said. “We’ve been able to practice a lot more as well. Our practices themselves are a lot more intense. I’d say that, overall, has just led to an increase in pretty much everyone’s abilities in previous years.”
Anderson has clinched 61 putouts and 62 assists. Anderson also has a sum of 30 hits, seven doubles, and 15 runs batted in.
“Coach Calcaterra, who is the assistant coach as well as coach Decker, the head coach, are new this year, and they both really push for a huge work ethic,” Anderson said. “Their main thing is getting better every day, and it doesn’t matter if we win or lose, we just can’t get out-hustled by the other team, and I think that’s really important.  Because not only does it allow us to gain momentum late in games, but it just looks better, it makes us feel better as players.”
When asked who influenced his play this season, Kregel was also quick to name his coaches.
“I can tell you that he’s been there working with me this entire season,” Kregel said. “I feel like he really wants me to succeed, and that’s good knowing that someone’s there behind me.... Coach Brown is our assistant coach. He’s a volunteer coach. I had a pretty long talk with him at the beginning of the season, and he pretty much inspired me just to be the best person I can on and off the field, which has really helped me.”
The three sophomores are leaders offensively and in the field, securing impressive stats at bat and in each of their respective positions.
“Starting with this year, they’ve really worked hard,” Wineski said. “They’ve realized after all the injuries and other things that have plagued our team this year that we’re down to a small number…so you have to step up.”

"When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'"
 
You've heard this quote from Mr. Rogers so many times over the past week—over television, the radio, and on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. Surely it would've gotten stale by now if only it weren't so true, and here at Harvard, we've gotten to see firsthand the power of "helpers" throughout the crazy mess that was last week. Flyby thinks they deserve some recognition—so here, in no particular order, is a list of some of our favorite "Harvard Helpers."
1. Everyone who joined the "futon network." For Mark R. Jahnke '13, a Crimson magazine and business editor, last week was measured in blocks. Jahnke ran in the Boston Marathon and was stopped just three blocks away from Bolyston Street when the bombs went off. After the MIT shooting, he tuned into the police scanner. "I heard that shots were fired on 109 Garden Street. That's just two blocks from the Quad," Jahnke said. He immediately sent out emails over the Pforzheimer and Crimson e-mail lists, urging people to stay where they were and arranging for a futon network for students stranded by the River or in the Quad. The network moved to a Google Document, where dozens of students offered up sleeping space. "I don't know how many people made use of it, but I wanted people to have that option. It's a 20 to 30 minute walk between the River and the Quad."
 
2. The HUDS staffers who showed up to work on Friday—and during a hurricane—and in the middle of a blizzard. There aren't enough standing ovations in the world for you.
 
3. #VirtualVisitas tweeters. When Visitas was canceled, Harvard students, administrators, and alumni flocked to Twitter as an alternative venue for reaching out and answering questions from prospective students. Sophia F. Randolph '16, who was the first to use the catchy hashtag on Twitter, said that though she had already decided to attend Harvard when she came to Visitas, the weekend was an important time for her to experience campus culture and meet future classmates. Randolph said she hoped that the Twitter conversations would at least help give prefrosh a sense of that campus culture. "Any taste of that they can get virtually—or visiting at another time—is really important in either making this decision or feeling more comfortable with the decision you've already made," Randolph said.
4. Drew Faust. Lest you forget that our president is an unbelievably classy person, see the letter she penned to the Class of 2017. It may not be a replacement to the advice she hoped to give in person, but its fierce, welcoming warmth succeeds in capturing the best of life at Harvard.
 
5. The freshmen in Wigglesworth F. Cooped up in his entryway on Friday, Colin J. F. Diersing '16 saw the efforts to move Visitas to Twitter but worried that most high school students wouldn't have Twitter accounts. He and some friends on his floor decided to make a video highlighting life at Harvard, and spent most of Saturday night and Sunday morning filming. "We've gotten a lot of positive feedback—some students messaged us to say they'd committed after watching it," Diersing said. "They probably would've committed anyway, but people seemed to really enjoy the video."

The renovations of Old Quincy offered rising upperclassmen everything that administrators could imagine, but Quincy students have made their housing priorities quite clear: P.O.E. (Parties Over Everything).
Upperclassmen seem to be more concerned with their ability to host large parties in common spaces than they are excited about the new furnishings that enhance and beautify the renovated dorm. With this in mind, is there anything the administration can do or offer to entice students to flock to the new Old Quincy? We at Flyby had a few ideas:
1. Ca$h Moneys: Invest in the students. $500 a person.
2. One puppy per person: You get a puppy! We all do!
3. Jobs: Seniors need 'em, the administration may or may not have them.
4. Make it nasty: Literally just cause a rodent infestation in New Quincy.
5. Private common rooms. Awkward…

For those of you who have as big of a sweet tooth as some of us here at Flyby do, you'll be happy to know that the pop-up "Donut Shop" might become a regular Sunday morning phenomenon in Quincy.
The brainchild of Sam R. Peinado '15 (who learned how to make donuts over Winter break and came up with the idea of selling them on campus), the Shop had its grand opening this past Sunday at the Quincy Grill and stayed open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m..
The Shop quickly proved to be a popular pre-brunch/post-lunch snack option, and sold over 350 freshly made apple cider cake donuts and donut holes on its first day of operation—a test run for determining the future of the Shop.
Peinado and Anneli L. Tostar '15—who helps out with the marketing aspects of the Shop—plan to take a break this weekend to refine their recipe. They said that the Shop's continued existence depends on its popularity with students.
"We're still trying to find out if it's a feasible endeavor," said Tostar, who is also a Crimson arts and news editor. "Whether or not it's fiscally successful is what we're looking at."
The first test run of the Donut Shop went well enough to convince the owners to have a second test run, which will take place on Sunday, May 5. They are counting on your continued interest in their enterprise: keep buying donuts, and the Donut Shop might just be around for a long time to come!

UPDATED: April 26, 2013, at 9:22 a.m.
Nalini Ambady, a former associate professor of psychology at Harvard, is currently fighting for her life against leukemia. Ambady, who is now a professor at Stanford, has just seven weeks to find a bone marrow match before her next round of chemotherapy. According to the website nalinineedsyou.com, Ambady has a one in 20,000 chance of finding a matching donor.
The chances of finding a bone marrow donor on the registry are currently far smaller for her and others of South Asian descent than they are for the average person of Caucasian descent.
But tomorrow, you can do your part to increase Ambady's chances of finding a suitable donor. The Be The Match Registry of the National Marrow Donor Program will be hosting a donor drive in Annenberg on Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Regardless of whether or not you are of South Asian heritage, registering yourself as a bone marrow donor is a significant contribution to the fight against leukemia and other diseases.
There are numerous commonly held misconceptions about donating bone marrow. In reality, according to Be The Match, signing on to the bone marrow registry takes only a few minutes, the donation process involves a simple outpatient procedure, and the National Marrow Donor Program reimburses donors for any expenses involved.
For more information about Professor Ambady, check out NaliniNeedsYou.com and this short video that her friends and former students have created.
Update: According to a representative from Be The Match, the location of today's bone marrow donor drive has been changed and is now scheduled take place in Annenberg Hall from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

In the aftermath of last week's traumatic events, the campus seems to be blooming—or more accurately, sprinkled—with daffodils. Today, students walked around the Yard holding not just textbooks and backpacks, but also little pots of sunshine. These bits of yellow floating around, provided by Campus Services, combined with the gorgeous day seemed to be verification that spring is here.
"They're the flower version of a comfort dog," said Lisa Hogarty, Vice President for Campus Services and the woman responsible for the daffodils. She said that Campus Services had originally planned to fill the new plaza by the Science Center with a "field of flowers" last Friday, alongside student performances and a dedication by President Faust, but were forced to reschedule and reorganize early that morning due to the city-wide lockdown.
With the flowers and events postponed, the Undergraduate Council called President Faust's office, letting her know that they wanted to construct a remembrance wall in appreciation for those who have supported the student body in trying times—from the Boston Police Department to Harvard University Dining Services.
"A lot of undergrads realized that we have so much to be grateful for," said Jen Q. Y. Zhu '14, Undergraduate Council Vice-President. "We wanted some way to show our thanks and appreciation for them taking care of us everyday."
The UC got in touch with Hogarty, who had a contractor build the boards that stood in the middle of the plaza today in addition to ensuring that those flowers would still be put to use. Thus, daffodils were placed around the plaza and on the steps of Memorial Church—deemed "the porch"—free for students to snag as a bright decoration for their dorm rooms. Many students picked up daffodils and wrote on the remembrance wall on their way to and from classes.
"The Plaza gives us a blank palette to paint on," said Hogarty. "One of our ongoing goals is to bring all sorts of color to that space." Although they have now taken on a different meaning in conjunction with the remembrance wall, these bright flowers still symbolize the kind of new beginning they were originally intended to represent.
