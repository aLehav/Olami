After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the first round of budget cuts bid farewell to hot breakfast, the Widener Café, and free coffee in many of Harvard’s departments. Even after the administration offered eligible staffers early retirement packages in order to cut costs, Dean Michael Smith said there was still more hacking to go and to expect a restructuring of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. However, last week’s announcement that the administration is offering early retirement packages to faculty in FAS and four of Harvard’s professional schools comes as a bit of a surprise. While we understand the necessity of the package and we appreciate that early retirement may be a tempting offer for faculty, we do have concerns about its implications for academics at Harvard.
The theory behind the plan is that it will reduce costs by hiring younger faculty members at lower salaries, as well as shrink faculty size—which has increased drastically over the last decade—by hiring at a rate lower than the rate of attrition. In order to achieve these goals, faculty members over the age of 65 who have served at least 10 years at Harvard are eligible and can choose between three options for retirement: one year, two years, or four years in the future. All the plans include paid sabbatical. Additionally, faculty  members accepting the package will be paid $1,000 to assist them with financial planning.
The package is quite compelling for older, tenured faculty members who remain at Harvard. Yet their loss will be an unfortunate sacrifice for undergraduates, as such faculty members’ experience is unrivaled. Many of the faculty members who qualify for the package are pioneers and leaders in their fields, and their absence will be quite notable.
Yet this development is also an opportunity to bring in or promote younger faculty members who will hopefully prove their worth and establish themselves in the realm of academia while also bringing new perspectives to education. Sooner or later, younger faculty members need to climb the ranks, and perhaps offering older faculty a golden opportunity to retire will provide an impetus for new talent to shine.
Beyond the turnover in professors, we are also concerned with the number of professors that Harvard will be left with after the package takes effect. Dean Smith has clearly stated that he intends to shrink faculty; we are worried that such a change will adversely affect class offerings and, importantly, class sizes. Small class settings and the breadth of our course offerings are vital to the undergraduate experience, and we hope they are not sacrificed for financial reasons. Moreover, small departments, especially those that are composed of committees, might be more negatively affected than others which have more professors to spare. Administrators must work to ensure such departments do not inequitably suffer, and they also must minimize the difference between rates of attrition and hiring in order to ensure that smaller course offerings and larger classes do not become the norm.
Though they may gripe, undergraduates’ academic experience is not grossly impacted by the lack of hot breakfast. It will be, however, severely diminished by an increase in class size and a decrease in course offerings; Dean Smith and the rest of FAS must make sure Harvard remains a prestigious academic institution where students receive a first-class education, no matter the cost.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Tiger Woods won his first Masters Tournament, Jack Nicklaus famously quoted Bobby Jones by saying that “he plays a game of which I am not familiar.” The aftermath of the recent Tiger Woods scandal has left Tiger in a situation extremely unfamiliar to him. What started out as a news story that covered Woods’s health when he got into a late-night car accident outside his home in Windermere, Fla., quickly turned into speculation about his family and personal life. While some of the details have been blurred surrounding the aftermath of crash, the involvement of alcohol and Woods’s alleged affairs have opened up the Pandora’s box of Woods’s normally private life.
Tiger has made it clear that the alleged affairs mounting are not all hearsay. On his personal website, Tiger issued a statement offering a “profound apology” for “transgressions” that he regrets “with all of my heart.” The details of these transgressions, however, remain vague. U.S. Weekly released a voicemail allegedly left by Tiger on Los Angeles cocktail waitress Jeremy Grubbs’s phone asking the woman to erase her name from his phone, and the 24-year-old has told the press that she was involved in a 31-month sexual affair with Woods.
After skipping out on the recent World Chevron Challenge, a tournament Woods was planning on hosting, Tiger has made it clear that he wants to remove himself from the spotlight until this boils down. This spotlight is indeed considerable—Tiger is far and away the highest-paid athlete in the world, with numerous endorsements like Nike and AT&T pushing him over $1 billion in career earnings. He not only is the face of the PGA Tour but also started the Tiger Woods Charitable Foundation and the Tiger Woods Learning Center. Tiger even has a DVD box set of his golf highlights at a time where he is nowhere near close to retiring. For a man who is the consummate public figure, requests for privacy, what he calls “an important and deep principle,” are not possible.
Tiger Woods cannot expect the world to record his every putt and fist pump on the golf course yet turn its head when problems arise. For someone who offers life advice to children, who aims to accomplish things in golf that no one has before, and who has the most recognizable face in sports, his personal actions and transgressions are vitally important. If he intends for fans to donate to his foundation and buy clothes from his personal line of golf apparel, he must act in appropriate ways in all aspects of his life.
Is this fair? Is it fair that Saturday Night Live fired some cheap shots at Tiger and his wife in a recent skit, or that football halftime shows joked at the prospect of Tiger’s wife attacking him with a golf club? The answer, unfortunately for Tiger, is yes. Having chosen to live a public life, Tiger knows full well that his profession will televise his weekly tournaments, and that commercials, logos, and billboards will print his face all over the world. His public status therefore includes a loss of privacy; though none of this is a legal matter, practically Tiger must know that, like a politician, his public success comes with public scrutiny.
Eventually, Tiger, the media, and the public will move past this drama, just as it has moved beyond the personal lives of athletes like Kobe Bryant, Ray Lewis, and Alex Rodriguez. For now, however, it will be some time before Tiger gets out of the woods.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It doesn’t matter why and how Harvard bought many dozens of acres in Boston’s Allston and Brighton neighborhoods during the past two decades. Those plans have been rendered unfunded and obsolete by Harvard’s financial situation and Harvard’s plans to spend a billion dollars or more renovating undergraduate housing in Cambridge.
What matters now is what Harvard will do both with what it already owns in Allston and Brighton and with the eight-acre site of the Charlesview Apartments that Harvard may soon acquire.
In 2007, Harvard announced a 50-year plan for nine to 10 million square feet of new construction in Allston. More specificity was provided in a March 2008 list of projects totaling 2.1 million square feet that would begin Boston’s permitting process by 2013. But Harvard’s Allston and Brighton land holdings are so vast that even this massive expansion would not touch more than 20 acres of its Allston and Brighton property.
While these plans had their supporters and detractors, little can be accomplished by dwelling on what they envisioned for the distant future and may never accomplish. Instead of debating what might have been, Harvard has an opportunity—and perhaps an obligation to itself and its neighbors—to chart a new and bold course for its future in Allston and Brighton. “Bold” may not be a favored word in the Harvard lexicon these days, but there is an important difference between being bold and being reckless. Timidity and fear create stasis and decay. It is vision, assertiveness, and ambition that move our institutions and society forward.
Students, graduates, and faculty of Harvard have a long tradition of invention and entrepreneurship. The Harvard-educated founders of Microsoft, Facebook, and City Year—to name just a few—took inspired chances that led to greatness. Falling back on what is expedient and simple is not the Harvard way, and that is not what Harvard should do now in Allston and Brighton.
The easy decision would be to do nothing. Harvard’s idle buildings, parking lots, and empty fields in Allston and Brighton could wait until Harvard is again brimming with institutional riches and ready to pronounce a new and masterful 50-year plan. If development of this plan and its implementation were just around the corner, then waiting would be the wise course of (in)action.
In reality, there will be no burst of institutional expansion in Allston and Brighton funded solely by Harvard in the foreseeable future. When President Faust speaks of Harvard’s “new normal,” she makes clear that it could be years or decades before Harvard regains the financial comfort needed for it to independently fund the multi-billion-dollar buildout of its Allston and Brighton empire.
But being land-rich and cash-poor does not have to cause a Harvard paralysis. Harvard’s land in Allston and Brighton is full of potential because of its proximity to the beautiful Charles River, the North Allston/North Brighton residential neighborhood, downtown Boston, Harvard, and more.
In a grand example, Harvard Business School graduate and former U.S. Senate candidate Stephen Pagliuca proposed a $3 billion public-private partnership to be built on Harvard property in Allston. This investment would create thousands of jobs and bring varied and deep rewards to the participating universities, businesses, and communities, as well as to our broader society.
On a more modest scale, Harvard students have suggested growing vegetables at an Allston farm. Junior faculty members have expressed interest in reasonably priced new housing, and graduates of HBS and others could benefit from affordable incubator office space close to campus.
Unleashing Harvard’s ingenuity is possible whether its endowment is $25 billion or $35 billion. Banks may be hesitant to lend, but the obstacle today is not a lack of financing—it is Harvard’s lack of will. Jump-starting activity on Harvard’s vacant and under-utilized property in Allston and Brighton doesn’t require a delegation visiting for several days like the one that President Faust just led to South Africa in November. With Harvard’s local Allston/Brighton opportunity, a combination of Rappaport Institute conferences, seed grants to interested individuals and organizations, business plan contests, and an open invitation from the administration to welcome and consider good ideas could be enough to get the ball rolling.
Referring to Harvard’s admissions process, the former Harvard president, Derek Bok, recently commented to The Boston Globe: “The great triumph is when you find someone in an unlikely place who against all odds achieved something.” Might the Harvard community apply the same spirit and, against today’s odds, achieve something in Allston and Brighton?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I know little about alcohol. I think Jim Beam is a character from “The Grapes of Wrath.” I think Poland Spring is tonic water. I think golf is a sport. Friends worry about my ignorance because they believe, as a columnist for this newspaper wrote years ago, that “The Harvardian who has never been drunk, who has been too delicate, sensitive and yes, too scared to kneel before King Bacchus…has just plain missed out.”
Rubbish. You can buzz without a beerfest.
Not that I discourage drinking. The Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services says that four fifths of Harvardians drink. Only a Lemonade Lucy would try to change that number. Harvardians use hard alcohol more often than other students but also more safely. They binge less than a third of the time while their peers binge over two fifths of it. Besides, happy drunks are fun: “I had a vodka tonic and I feel delightful!”
No, my crusade is more modest: to suggest moderation. To my drinking buddies, intoxication is emancipation. It offers infinite benefits. For instance, “Alcohol makes you less awkward,” they tell me. Please—alcohol makes you more awkward. When you were sober, you said that girl at the party was into you. Now that you’re drunk, you’re slapping your wrist, thrusting your pelvis, and shouting “You gotta hit that s—, man!” in front of the freshmen. Thank goodness your dry friend is there to tell people you’re referring to schoolwork.
“Drinking would be more fun if you were smashed,” my buddies reply. Again, I need convincing. When everyone is hammered, everyone is volatile. We’re at a party and you look plastered, so our sauced friend says, “Hey buddy, let’s get you home.” You explode: “What do you mean ‘hey buddy’?” I stop the fight and bring you home, but because you’re sloshed, you insist that we walk through Cambridge Common—at midnight—as you ask me, “What is the highest virtue?” Or maybe those are just my friends.
“No need to play grandpa,” my buddies retort—they’re stubborn when they’re juiced. Alcohol is a truth serum, and honesty is essential to friendships. Sometimes you need to shed your inhibitions. True, but you should keep a few for good measure. When I ask if you like the girl who eyed you at the party, all I need to know is “She’s nice, but no.” I can survive without demon rum’s opinion: “Oh God, she’s fat, so fat, so very, very fat.” Drunkenness is awkward, aggressive, and boorish.
Yes, these examples are unusual. Most Harvardians drink responsibly. Even I have a gin and tonic on occasion. But a good time does not require that you forget it the next morning. You can be content with Bud Light—or Barq’s. That said, I’m not concerned about teetotalers. If you can’t stand up to your drunk friends, you’re spineless. Rather, I’m concerned about the need for a moderate lifestyle, one that mixes drudgery with frivolity evenly.
Some students oscillate between extremes. They work, work, work until all they want to do is get wasted. Freshmen typify this regimen. OAODS found that three tenths of them drink when they arrive in September, but by October half of them do. The majority drinks reasonably, yet half of alcohol-related admissions to University Health Services each year are freshmen. Almost all these cases occur between Move-In Day and Harvard-Yale Weekend. These students swing rapidly between “stuffed shirt” and “popped collar.”
This drastic shift happens only once. Afterward, Harvardians follow national trends in their drinking patterns. Yet the belief that you should “work hard, play harder” remains. Unfortunately, this lifestyle offers too much stress and too little sleep. You’re skimming 200 pages a day in reading period because you spent your Sundays during the semester hung over. Why not study during the day and drink at night? Why not play as hard as you work?
“Thanks, Captain Obvious,” you think. Think again. Moderation is hard because it demands self-regulation. You sophisticates are more egregious than you realize. We’re playing beer pong when I notice you refilling your cups. “Haven’t you had enough?” I ask as you so urbanely chortle, “I can handle way more than this!” An hour later, you’re puking in my bag of Doritos. “You don’t understand,” say my buddies—there they go again—“It’s OK to have 12 beers if they loosen you up. Alcohol makes me witty!” Sure, and pizza makes me Italian. If you’re witty, be witty. Skip the blackout.
Here’s my friends’ morsel of truth: Everyone needs to chill. But here’s mine: To chill does not necessarily mean to chug. Whether working or playing, we should live moderately. And we should respect teetotalers. They drive us home from the bar.

Recently, it seems that our campus been a magnet for Hollywood A-listers, but it wasn’t until last week that one of them decided to truly slum it like a college kid by ditching the usual four-star accommodations for a walk-through in Winthrop.  Best known for his roles on “L.A. Law” and “Sex and the City,” award-winning actor, producer, director, and humanitarian Blair Underwood spent last week roaming campus as the Office for the Arts’ Artist in Residence, co-sponsored by the Harvard Foundation. And though he may have played a hotshot lawyer on “L.A. Law,” this time it was FM’s turn to cross-examine. Underwood comes clean about breaking into the industry, raising kids in Hollywood, the trials and tribulations of being one of People Magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People,” and living in a dorm as a 45-year-old celebrity.
1.Fifteen Minutes: What advice would you give to students who aspire to pursue a career in the performing arts post graduation?
Blair Underwood: The one thing I would say to you is [that] there is always a dual conversation to be had in terms of a career in the arts.  There is a conversation in regards to the arts themselves and the craft and the work and there’s a conversation on the other track about the business and the industry itself. The methods that I like to share with most individuals who plan to pursue the arts as a career is to constantly and consistently follow and work on the craft as an artist.  You also simultaneously have to be an entrepreneur now more than ever because of the new media and technology, because you can indeed create your own film almost on your cell phone.
2.FM: Because of your portrayal of the compelling attorney Jonathan Rollins in  the dramatic series “L.A. Law,” you were invited to visit Harvard Law School where you briefly met President Obama when he was serving as the President of the Harvard Law Review.  Could you tell then how successful he would become?
BU: The fact that my character on “L.A. Law” was the president of the Law Review was completely serendipitous.  Nobody knew of Barack Obama at that time. I have to say, even just meeting him, what I take away from here every time I come to Harvard is just truly how bright and hungry and intelligent and curious and insightful and bold the students are and inspiring to me.  Of course I saw it in him, but I see it so often on this campus.
FM: Given those experiences playing an attorney, do you ever wish you went to law school, a very popular postgraduate choice for many Harvard graduates?
BU: No, that has never been a desire of mine.  I think I get a lot of the benefits of playing one on TV without actually going through all the hard work.
3.FM: You attended Carnegie Mellon, where you were trained in musical theatre. Was Broadway your ultimate goal in college?
BU: I’d tell you even then and now I wanted to do it all. I just didn’t want to limit myself. Broadway was a particular goal. It was a goal but not the ultimate. I still haven’t done Broadway. I’ve done Shakespeare in the Park. Theater is my first love, but with all things, as you age and you mature, you just have different experiences. The idea of going there every night and recreating this character every night is not appealing to me now.
4.FM: You’ve been around the campus quite a bit, chatting with students in different Houses and dining halls. Have you observed anything unusual or funny about Harvard or Harvard students after spending some time here?
BU: The Winthrop room I’m in now is much bigger than when I was in college. I’m learning about some of these traditions like the primal shout—primal scream. But I have to say—this isn’t funny—but I’m so inspired by these students. As Shakespeare said, by the vitality and youth, but also the vitality of youthful hopes and aspirations. It’s hard times economically for the world, so to be around you students and to see and feel and interact with that sense of tomorrow and the future and hope is exciting.
5.
FM: Anything you regret not doing while in college or that you would do differently if you had the chance to go back?
BU: I don’t have any regrets because it worked out okay, [laughs] but if there is anything I could change or add, it would be probably studying psychology. I definitely have considered possibly looking to get a degree online. I can’t do it now because of life and time commitments, but it really is the very thing that made me want to become an actor—the study of and the fascination of human behavior and human interaction.
6.FM: Once you land a part, do you have a specific routine for how you ready yourself for the role?
BU: In the broad strokes, I take what is written in the script—it’s called the givens, what they give to you—and fill that out in terms of intellectual knowledge of what is needed in very basic terms. In other words, the basic general, rudimentary idea of what that is. Then you start filling out the emotions and the layers of the character, the heart and soul, the blood and guts, which is my favorite part. And some characters are different. I did a mini-series called “Mama Flora’s Family” and in that I had to age from 16 to 50. I had a lot of makeup on, of course. What you need to bring that kind of character to reality is much different than something that is closer to you and your age and how you walk and talk.
7.FM: You have had many well-known roles in TV shows such as “L.A. Law”, “Sex and the City,” and “In Treatment”, as well as movies such as “Rules of Engagement”, “Gattaca”, and “Full Frontal”. What has been your favorite role?
BU: There are a couple, but one of my favorites was a movie I made called “Just Cause” with Sean Connery and Lawrence Fishburne. It was after a seven-year run on “L.A. Law” playing a good guy basically. That character, I played a serial killer pedophile who was on death row for the murder of a child. A bad guy.
8.FM: A lot of Harvard students are worrying about the lack of jobs in this uncertain economy.  However, it’s always this kind of economy for an actor who’s starting out.
BU:[laughs] You’re right! It absolutely is.
FM: Did you ever consider a more secure career choice?  Were you ever a “starving artist” and what was your first job out of college?
BU: I never considered another career choice, but would I have if I had been forced to? Yes! You gotta eat at a certain point. I was very fortunate in that I started working very early when I moved to New York in January of 1985. My first job then was “The Cosby Show.” I had one word, one line, so pretty much it was a walk-on, but it really opened up a lot of doors.
9.FM: What has been your favorite part about the Hollywood experience?  What do you like least about it?
BU: My favorite part is to have had a career in Hollywood because it was a dream of mine to go to Hollywood and be able to work—that’s a blessing, that’s a gift. The worst is [that] it’s such a pivotal period of transition for our industry because of new technology and trying to understand how we should monetize it and how to share the profits of that and see how we actors fit into that. It’s harder to make a mark in the industry today than it was 20 years ago.
10.FM: During your impressive career, you’ve received numerous prestigious awards and nominations commending not only your exceptional talent but also your humanitarian efforts. And let’s not forget back in 2000 when People Magazine bestowed you with the highly coveted honor of being named to their 50 Most Beautiful People list.
BU: Marietta, no you didn’t.
FM: Yes, yes we did. How does it feel to be the object of desire for so many?
BU: I have no idea, Marietta. How does it feel? Oh God. I don’t know, I never have an answer to that.  I should have an answer for that. Listen, it could be worse. I could be called worse.
11.FM: What is the craziest thing a fan has ever done for you?
BU: I don’t get a lot of crazy, which is great. I prefer it that way. Grabbing where one should not be grabbing, in public especially. Is that vague enough?
12.FM: Is it difficult raising kids in Hollywood? Do your kids ever push you to take them to certain events or premieres?
BU: I don’t think it is ever easy raising kids anywhere. But [Hollywood] has its own unique challenges. I constantly am telling them they grow up in a bubble. It’s incumbent upon my wife and I to give them a certain sense of the real world and giving back. Every once in awhile, they want to go somewhere. I took my son to the premiere party of the “Star Trek” DVD release, something I would not usually go to, but he’s a big fan. The day before, I took my daughter to the premiere of “The Princess and The Frog” because she loves Disney.
13.FM: You’ve had some controversy surrounding you in the past.  Did the criticism bother you?
BU: Criticism never really bothers me because if you do something against the grain you’re always going to have people who don’t understand it and be resistant to it. If you’re an artist, you either learn to deal with it and not let it sweep you away or not. You gotta be true to who you are.
14.FM: You were an “army brat” and have lived in many places.  Do you prefer the East Coast or the West Coast?
BU: As an army brat, you learn to make wherever you are work. I’d have to say I prefer the East Coast and its essence and its history. There is a certain East Coast vibe in reality and focus of life and education that is very different from the West Coast.
15FM: You’ve produced a series of books, have your own production company, directed and acted.  What’s the most difficult for you and what’s your favorite? What’s next?
BU: The most challenging is probably, now, directing. I love it, I just haven’t done a lot of it. Next, I guest star on a show called “The New Adventures of Old Christine.” I am shooting that next week. Beyond that, our production company is always raising money to turn the book series that I have into films. We are producing some reality television and creating hopefully something called a vook—a video book. It’s basically taking the experience of a digital book and adding a visual short video vignette component to the digital experience. Thus vook, video book.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mather House Masters Sandra F. Naddaff ’75 and Leigh G. Hafrey ’73 announced Monday night that they will be stepping down at the end of the academic year after serving for 18 years, the longest tenure of any current Masters.
Several members of the Mather House community said they were surprised by the news of Naddaff and Hafrey’s departure, which came only two weeks after House Masters in Cabot and Eliot announced they would also be leaving.
Naddaff and Hafrey cited several reasons for stepping down, including Hafrey’s busy travel schedule as a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the fact that their youngest son Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey, who is also a Crimson arts editor, is now a freshman living in Matthews.
“This has been our season in Mather, and it’s time for it to end,” said Naddaff, who serves as Director of Studies in the Literature concentration and also directs the Freshman Seminar Program.
Both the outgoing and incoming House Committee co-chairs said the House Masters are a consistent presence at Mather bonding events—including the annual Mather Lather dance—and that they are an essential part of Mather’s spirit.
“They’re really universally loved by Mather House,” said incoming HoCo co-chair David L. Billing ’11.
Several HoCo members noted that the name of the Mather House Mascot, a stuffed lion named “Leighdra,” is a portmanteau of the Masters’ names.
“They’re a huge part of what makes the Mather community as strong as it is,” resident tutor Sara M. Watson ’07 said.
Hafrey and Naddaff said that while they will not be involved in the search for new House Masters, Mather’s tutors and students will have active input.
Hafrey and Naddaff met as residents of Pforzheimer House (then called North House) when Hafrey transferred from Wesleyan in 1971 as a junior.
They married in 1984 and welcomed their first son, Nathaniel Naddaff-Hafrey ’08, a former Crimson arts editor, two years later.
Hafrey and Naddaff began their tenure as Mather House Masters in 1993, before randomization.
At that time, the two said the House was initially athlete-heavy and mostly male.
“It was a very good-spirited House then,” Hafrey said.
But he added that after randomization began in 1996, the influx of jazz musicians and actors, among others, made the House feel more “complete.”
“Suddenly the House felt a lot more alive,” Hafrey said.
The two said they do not know yet where they will live next year but plan on remaining connected to the Mather community.
“You do get this sense of the House as a...” Hafrey began, pausing and struggling to find the right words.
“...multigenerational, large, interconnected, community,” said Naddaff, finishing his sentence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The family of John B. Edwards III ’10 filed a wrongful death suit against Harvard and two UHS professionals last week, alleging that Edwards’ doctors negligently prescribed the young man a cocktail of four drugs that contributed to his suicide in November 2007.
Three of those drugs­—the anti-acne drug Accutane and the antidepressants Prozac and Wellbutrin—have been shown to increase the likelihood of suicidal thoughts in patients.
In interviews with The Crimson this week, a majority of Harvard psychiatrists said that the combination of drugs prescribed to Edwards was within normal standards of practice but required close supervision by a physician.
Edwards, who first sought care at University Health Services in June 2007, was prescribed the three drugs in addition to Adderall over the course of the following five months to treat symptoms of anxiety, depression, and difficulty concentrating.
Though three of these drugs increase suicidal thoughts, Dr. Donald B. Condie, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that suicidal side effects are generally not known to be additive and that it is fairly common for a patient to be taking more than one anti-depressant.
“Combining the use of Adderall, Wellbutrin, and Prozac for someone who is suffering from symptoms of depression, as well as attentional difficulties, may be reasonable,” added Brigham and Women’s Hospital psychiatrist Dr. Kelly J. Hoagland.
Though this mix of drugs is commonly prescribed for patients who exhibit such symptoms of depression, the combination may increase the risk of suicide, according to Dr. Andrew B. Clark, medical director of the children and the law program at MGH.
“There is no data to indicate that the effects are additive, but it stands to reason that if one contains a risk that the addition of another would raise risks,” Clark said.
The Edwards family’s suit alleges that the deceased’s nurse practitioner, Marianne Cannon, prescribed his medication without proper oversight from her supervising physician.
Brigham and Women’s psychiatrist Dr. Arthur J. Barsky III, who said that the combination of drugs was appropriate, nevertheless expressed concerns regarding a nurse practitioner’s role as the sole healthcare provider.
“In general, if you’re worried about [patients’] suicide potential, you probably would want an MD to do a suicide evaluation,” Barsky said.
The lawsuit also alleges that Edwards told doctors at UHS that he had already resolved suicidal thoughts he had harbored in the past.
Brigham and Women’s psychiatrist Dr. Barry S. Fogel said that depending on the facts and details of the case, the practitioners could have indeed failed in their responsibilities towards their patient.
“If someone has a genuine past history of suicidal thoughts and is started on an anti-depressant and then a second anti-depressant is added, having appointments several weeks apart with no scheduled interim contact and no review apparently by a psychopharmacologist, this sounds like substandard care,” Fogel said.
“If the facts are right, the family will have an extremely easy time convincing a jury that the follow-up wasn’t commensurate with the seriousness of the problem,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 6:30 p.m. on a recent Sunday evening, students began to trickle into the dining room of the Dudley Co-op and  help themselves to the baked tofu, vegan pasta, and salad from the mismatched pots on the table in the entrance hall.
Unlike upperclassmen living in the House dining halls, residents of the Dudley Co-op eat together every night and work with one another to cook the all-vegetarian options and homemade bread.
The food represents the community of 3 Sacramento St.—co-operative and, as Martin Eiermann ’10 put it, “quirky.”
‘FOOD IN INSANE QUANTITIES’
Earlier that afternoon, (Artemisha) Misha S. Goldfeder ’10 rummaged around the large walk-in refrigerator in the Co-op kitchen, searching for ingredients for that night’s dinner.
Buying food for the 32 Co-op residents can be a daunting task, according to Rebecca R. Rojer ’10, but the Co-op residents split up duties to make the process easier.
“It’s cool getting food in insane quantities, and it’s about 50 percent cheaper than retail,” Rojer said.
The co-op works with bulk distributors and a stand at the Harvard Farmers’ Market to buy ingredients. Along with the communal labor, these deals allow the Co-op to offer a significantly lower board cost than the traditional Harvard meal plan. Board was $750 this past semester, according to Robin S. Bellows ’11, while eating at a dining hall cost over $2000 per semester, according to the Financial Aid Office website.
The quality and type of food often changes from semester to semester because the community is so small and as the character of the residents changes, so does the food, Rojer added.
“There are some times when people care about food politics and other years when people are just hungry,” Rojer said.
After finding what she needed, Goldfeder set a large cookbook on top of ten blocks of tofu on the table next to her. The tofu has to drain in order to be cooked properly, she explained.
Although many residents eat meat, all Co-op meals are strictly vegetarian and offer vegan dishes. Residents also opt for organic options if they are not too expensive.
“I much prefer the fresh vegetables here. When I go to a dining hall it all kind of tastes the same—like nothing,” Rojer said.
While residents like Rojer prefer the fresh vegetables to typical House dining Hall fare, others acknowledge it appeals to a certain kind of character.
“It’s the kind of things that a bunch of scrawny vegetarians like to munch on,” said Remeike J.B. Forbes ’11, one of the Co-op Co-Presidents.
WHIPPING UP A MEAL
This particular evening, Goldfeder was in charge of cooking all of the main dishes for  dinner. She added three chopped heads of cabbage to the already overflowing giant wok on the stove. Her vegetable stir-fry, along with pasta, tofu, and salad, would feed all 32 residents.
Cooperative living is fundamentally about taking responsibility for your own life, according to Dudley House Master James “Jim” M. Hogle, and cooking meals is a large part of this lifestyle.
When the Co-op was founded in 1958, Radcliffe College and Lesley University students were hired to do most of the cooking, Forbes said. As the community evolved, residents have taken on all of the day-to-day responsibilities, which they said allows college to be more like real life.
“[The Co-op] reminds me of my house. My mom loves to cook,” Goldfeder said. “You have to work to make it your home, but it’s really a home, not a dorm.”
The Co-op is managed through a points system in which students need to fulfill a certain number of credits every two-week cycle, which means cooking dinner can be an optional chore.
“A lot of people in the Co-op eat incredibly well but never cook,” Rojer said.
For those who do cook, meals are an opportunity to channel creativity and inspiration, Rojer added.
“I like to have themes in a meal because it’s a little weird when we have Indian food and pasta in the same meal,” said Goldfeder, who, like many in the Co-op, is a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator.
She nibbled on a piece of leftover tofu, contemplating whether she would reuse it.
“The theme of this dinner—take all of these old things and make them better, hopefully” she said.
Recipes are rarely followed. While they are useful for inspiration, Goldfeder said, it is impossible to follow a recipe when cooking for 32 people.
“At the Co-op, there’s a lot of public education in cooking,” Rojer said. “You learn little things, like that certain spices taste better toasted.”
For breakfast and lunch, residents have access to the full-scale industrial kitchen to cook their own meals, a perk that drew some of the current residents to the Co-op.
Christopher A. Johnson-Roberson ’11 said he decided to leave his blocking group when they wanted to move out of Dewolfe housing. Making the switch to the Co-op allowed him continued access to a kitchen.
AT THE TABLE
By 6:45 p.m., over 20 Co-op residents were seated at the long central table among an assortment of old mugs and mismatched plates and chairs, a stark contrast to the uniformity of House dining halls.
The Co-op dining hall is the central space of the building, and it brings the community together throughout the day, according to Iman E. James ’12.
“I’ve been sitting at this dining table for the past six hours. The dining room is actually more social than the living room, not even including dinners,” James said.
Quiet conversations and the clinking of forks filled the room. As Goldfeder took her plate at the table, everyone looked up from their food and began to clap—a nightly tradition of thanking the cook.
“I love dinner and the whole ritual of sitting down,” Eva B. Rosenberg ’10 said. “Everyone is there at more or less the same time, and there’s always fun conversations and bonding. It’s the best way to show a non-Co-oper what it’s about.”
Some residents, however, acknowledge the drawbacks of not having the House dining hall experience or a Harvard meal plan.
“Harvard has no central space, so the dining hall serves that purpose. Technically, we’re kind of excluded,” Forbes said. “I miss the free French fries.”
After ten minutes, the table fell silent as Forbes began the Co-op’s weekly meeting, held over dinner each Sunday. This evening, the students discussed the idea of reducing communal dinners to give people a break from cooking during the stress of exams.
After debate on the proposal, Anne Marie Zapf-Belanger ’10 made an earnest appeal to the other residents to keep cooking.
“I would like to have dinner during exams because dinner makes me happy,” she said.
A few snaps of agreement could be heard in the room as the Co-op residents voted to keep cooking dinner, another example of the “very, very close-knit” community Hogle described.

Mass. Attorney General Martha Coakley—a former Middlesex County district attorney—won the Democratic primary yesterday in the special elections to fill the United States Senate seat vacated after the death of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.
In a low-turnout election, Coakley won the nomination with 47 percent of the vote—nearly 20 percent more than her closest competitor, Congressman Michael E. Capuano, who represents Cambridge, Somerville, Boston, and Chelsea in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Social entrepreneur Alan A. Khazei ’83, who co-founded the public service organization City Year and has actively sought student support, came in third with 13 percent of the vote. Stephen G. Pagliuca—a graduate of Harvard Business School and currently a co-owner of the Boston Celtics—finished last with roughly 12 percent.
Republican candidate Scott P. Brown, a state senator, easily won the GOP nomination with 89 percent of the vote.
Voter turnout for the special election primaries was relatively lackluster, with Cambridge logging only 15 percent of its registered voters, according to Executive Director of the Cambridge Election Commission Marsha Weinerman.
Brian S. McNiff, spokesman for Mass. Secretary of State William F. Galvin, said that it was difficult to judge the turnout for yesterday’s elections since it was the first ever special election held statewide.
“It has been slow in spots, but this election is unique,” he said. “In 2008’s primaries when Senator Kerry had an opponent, the turnout was under 600,000—this is about comparable.”
McNiff added that he did not believe Massachusetts’ reputation for being a Democratic stronghold necessarily deterred voters of either party. “The election of a Senator is an important ballot to cast, so I think people would turn out for that reason,” he said.
Two polling stations on campus—one in Quincy House and one at the Graduate School of Design—saw a slow trickle of voters throughout the day.
Nancy R. Aiguier, a poll inspector at Quincy House, said that voter turnout for the ward was under 15 percent and that the majority of voters she checked in were registered Democrats.
“The turnout was mixed and the ones who were registered Republicans seemed to be an older crowd and very few,” Aiguier said.
Harvard College Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 said that while the Dems have a policy of non-endorsement, he himself was torn between supporting Capuano and Khazei.
“At the end of the day though, it’s going to be a liberal Democrat who will fill the seat,” Berkenfeld said. “For the Harvard Dems, we can’t lose.”
But Harvard Republican Club President Mark A. Isaacson ’11 said that the Republican candidates were making an effective ideological statement, even if the state’s senators have historically been Democratic.
“This is not an invitation to be invigilant,” Isaacson said.
Tennessee native Peyton R. Miller ’12 was among the few who voted in the Republican primary yesterday.
“When I went into the poll...the guy who checked me in told me, ‘You can’t vote here,’” Miller said. “I know he was joking, but I definitely didn’t appreciate it.”

Eleven lines of human embryonic stem cells produced by the Harvard-affiliated Children’s Hospital Boston were approved for federal research funding by the National Institutes of Health last Wednesday.
The thirteen total lines approved by the NIH constitute the first batch of new stem cell sources authorized for funding since 2001, when former President George W. Bush prohibited the approval of new stem cell lines. Twenty-seven more lines developed at Harvard are slated for approval in the next few weeks.
Prior to the most recent group of approved stem cell lines, only 22 lines had been eligible for federal funding, according to Harvard Medical School associate professor George Q. Daley ’82, director of the Children’s Hospital lab that oversaw the development of the recently approved lines.
“The new policy gives us much more flexibility to do experiments that only our imagination can define,” Daley said.
In July, President Barack Obama reversed his predecessor’s restriction on the authorization of new stem cell lines, enabling the NIH to approve funding for the Children’s Hospital’s batch.
Obama established new guidelines for the ethics of stem cell research that require all cells to originate from embryos donated from in-vitro fertilization.
The NIH’s approval of the Harvard lines marks the entrance of stem cell research into the same processes of attaining funding as other areas of life science research, according to Daley.
Currently, 31 proposed grants—valued at a total of at least $21 million—that hope to use the new cell lines are ready for review, he added.
Harvard’s science spokesman B.D. Colen said that the approval of the new stem cell lines signals NIH’s openness to the development and funding of more research that involves the use of stem cells.
In addition, the availability of federal funding sources will permit researchers to work with new stem cell sources without relying on private funding, according to Colen.
“This will provide another avenue of funding and will bring more people and other institutions into the field,” Colen said. “That will be encouraging to some of the best young scientists who may have thought it was too risky to go into stem cell work.”
Daley said he was not surprised that the Harvard lines were part of the first group to receive approval for funding, since he and other faculty members in the Harvard Stem Cell Institute contributed to the drafting of the Obama administration’s guidelines regarding stem cell research.
The Office of Health Communication and Public Liaison at the NIH declined to comment on the Harvard lines because the 27 upcoming lines have not yet been approved.

Despite the busier weeks leading up to winter break this year due to the new academic calendar, administrators are encouraging students and faculty to shop in Harvard Square for their holiday needs as part of an effort to support local businesses through a tough economy and to meet the University’s sustainability goals.
University President Drew G. Faust kicked off the “Think Harvard Square” initiative last week by shopping in the Square for people on her list as well as for the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Holiday Gift Drive.
“Think Harvard Square” aims to promote local businesses during this year’s Sparklefest, the month-long celebration of the holidays in Harvard Square which includes the opening of the skating rink,  festive lighting in the Square, and the annual “Everyone Loves Latkes Party!”
The University has a long history of owning property in Harvard Square, but previous efforts to promote local businesses—such as running ads in The Crimson—were more subtle. The “Think Harvard Square” campaign marks the first year the University is directly involved with planning Sparklefest, according to James W. Gray, associate vice president of Harvard Real Estate Services.
Christine M. Heenan, the University’s vice president of government, community and public affairs, added that this is a “building year” for the University’s involvement in the Square.
“[The Harvard Square Business Association] and the University want to have more running room with it next year,” Heenan said, “and have a sustained awareness.”
Harvard is concerned about the well being of local shops in light of the economic situation and this is partially what prompted the University to take a more direct role, according to Gray.
In addition to economic concerns, Heenan said that Faust’s sustainability initiative also played a role in the University’s increased involvement.
“Thinking and shopping local is a key strength for promoting sustainability,” Heenan said.
As the University makes a special effort to reach out during this Sparklefest, some Harvard Square businesses are also offering unique promotions.
Francesca Cardullo, a co-owner of Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, said that her store has made improvements for this holiday season, including accepting Crimson Cash and re-carpeting their store.
Sarah Graham, a sales associate at Mint Julep, explained that the store is a running a one-day “Shop to Give” event during Sparklefest that will give 50% of proceeds  to the Boys and Girls Club of Middlesex County.
The idea is “just to give back to the community and to be an example to other businesses,” said Graham.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The host of MSNBC’s “Hardball with Chris Matthews” voiced his opposition to President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus plan and decision to increase troop levels in Afghanistan in a talk yesterday in the Kirkland Common Room.
In the discussion that was part of Kirkland House’s “Conversations with Kirkland,” Matthews said that the economic stimulus package should have been focused on jobs because they are more tangible and visible to the American public, which is in the midst of a down economy.
“You have to replace the smell of decay with the smell of construction,” Matthews said.
Matthews also expressed criticism for Obama’s decision to increase troop levels in Afghanistan.
“I don’t think the Afghanistan thing will work,” Matthews said. “If we had a draft, we wouldn’t be in Afghanistan.”
The political pundit’s discussion touched on several other national issues.
The Holy Cross College graduate and bestselling author expressed his support for the national health plan, and also commented on the implications of the  “Stupak Amendment” to the national healthcare bill, which prohibits the use of Federal funds “to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion.”
Matthews, who was previously a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics, said that he is pro-choice, but that he believes government involvement should be limited in this case.
“I don’t think that the government should fund abortion, it should be a totally personal decision,” Matthews said.
Matthews commented on Obama’s choices of Cabinet members and political strategies.
On the former, Matthews said “picking Hillary Clinton for Secretary of State was really majestic,” adding that the “most profound thing Obama did was unite the Democratic party to win by taking Bill and Hillary Clinton.”
The political commentator also shared some choice words about opposition to President Obama, including the “birther” movement, which questions the legitimacy of the President Obama’s U.S. birth certificate.
Matthews said that there was “a lot of white tribalism in the birther stuff” and labeled some of the rabble-rousing associated with such movements as “nativist.”
Matthews, who describes his politics as “center-left,” also offered some general advice for college students, urging young people to vote in order to push forward a progressive agenda.
“You wanna run the country once in a while? Vote once in a while,” he said. “If you don’t vote, you don’t count”
Other speakers in Kirkland’s series have included Reverend Al Sharpton, Mass. Senator John Kerry, and former Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Howard Dean.

In a recent filing of a wrongful-death civil suit to a district court in Florida, Harvard Medical School Psychiatry Professor Harold J. Bursztajn stated that CNN reporter Nancy Grace may have contributed to the suicide of Melinda Duckett, the mother of a 2-year-old who went missing in 2006.
Grace interviewed Duckett for her CNN television program, “Nancy Grace,” on Sept. 7, 2006. The interview aired the next day, after Duckett had shot herself.
In the opinion he provided to the U.S. District Court in Ocala, Fla., Bursztajn referred to Grace’s interview with Duckett at the time as “apparently unanticipated public humiliation... contributing to the cause of her suicide.”
According to the court filing, Bursztajn said that “the timing [of Duckett’s suicide] is consistent with an increased sense of despair following the interview and a fear of the effects of its broadcast.” He wrote that this led him to the preliminary conclusion that Grace may have contributed to the cause of Duckett’s suicide.
“She struck a highly accusatory tone in interviewing Melinda Duckett,” he wrote in the statement.
According to the transcript of the interview, Trenton Duckett, Duckett’s 2 year-old son, suddenly went missing one night after Duckett put him in bed and attended to company at her home. The toddler has not yet been found.
Grace questioned Duckett, asking about whether or not the FBI offered her a polygraph, and pressed for details that Duckett said she could not provide.
Towards the end of the transcript, Grace said, “Why aren’t you telling us and giving us a clear picture of where you were before your son was kidnapped?”
Ducket replied, “Because I’m not going to put those kind of details out?”
When Grace asked, “Why?” again, Ducket said, “Because I was told not to.”
Grace then continued, “Ms. Duckett, you are not telling us for a reason. What is the reason? You refuse to give even the simplest facts of where you were with your son before he went missing. It is day 12.”
According to The Orlando Sentinel, Grace has denied in court records that she mentally abused Duckett during the interview.
Bursztajn told The Crimson in an e-mailed statement that he was not able to comment because the case is still in litigation.

The No. 6 Harvard women’s hockey team has come a long way from 2-3-0.
With its early season struggles placed firmly in the past, the Crimson (7-3-2, 6-3-0 ECAC) is riding an eight-game streak without a loss, despite a challenging stretch of contests that has included a win and a tie against No. 2 Minnesota and another draw with No. 4 New Hampshire.
Harvard’s latest triumph came last night at Bright Hockey Center, in a 2-1 victory over Connecticut (8-6-4, 2-3-4 Hockey East)—another tough team that has bounced in and out of the national rankings this season.
“We’re going to be tough to play, and that’s what we always want to be,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “I think it’s clear that we can play with anybody, but we’ve also raised our own expectations now.”
Freshman Kaitlin Spurling scored the game-winning goal against the Huskies in the second period, and senior goaltender Christina Kessler picked up her 63rd career win to tie Ali Boe ’06 for first all-time in the Harvard record books.
“She’s doing a great job,” Stone said of Kessler’s mark. “Hopefully there will be many more of those before she graduates.”
UConn got on the board first, scoring a powerplay goal 2:11 into the game. After a body-checking penalty on Spurling left the Crimson a skater short, Huskies defenseman Cristin Allen received the puck off a faceoff and lasered a pass to teammate Jennifer Chaisson at the left post. The UConn center knocked a shot off of Harvard co-captain Cori Bassett’s skate into the net to give the Huskies an early 1-0 lead.
“We started slow,” Stone said. “It was kind of unfortunate that they got a quick powerplay goal.”
Unfortunately for the Huskies, its initial score lit a flame under the Harvard offense, which responded to the early deficit by relentlessly assaulting the net. The Crimson took the game’s next 14 shots on goal, pressuring goalie Alexandra Garcia and the UConn defense into committing several ill-advised penalties, the first of which proved costly.
With five and a half minutes left in the first period, Harvard rookie forward Jillian Dempsey raced past Huskies defender Casey Knajdek and seemed to have a clear shot on the net. But Knajdek tripped Dempsey up, possibly preventing a goal, but also giving the Crimson a power play.
Harvard took full advantage of the opportunity, when junior forward Liza Ryabkina took the puck at the left circle and fed it down low to classmate Kate Buesser, who was waiting at the near post. Buesser took the pass and redirected it past Garcia 15:44 into the game to tie the score at one.
In the first half of the second frame, it was the Crimson who had difficulty staying out of the penalty box. A pair of consecutive hooking penalties by co-captain Kathryn Farni put Harvard on the defensive, giving the Huskies momentum and allowing them to dictate the pace of the game.
“That happens in games,” Farni said. “Sometimes if you don’t play well in your [defensive] zone, you take bad penalties.”
UConn had its best chance to take the lead 4:34 into the period, when center Monique Weber charged through the slot and fired the puck at Kessler. The Crimson goalie made an agile stop, but the rebound went to Huskies forward Lisa Stathopulos. The rookie, tied for the UConn lead with 11 points this season, squared up a shot but bounced it off the left post.
With the Huskies failing to execute its power play, Harvard regrouped and once again took control of the game. With under five minutes left in the second, the Crimson went on its fifth power play of the game following a boarding penalty on UConn’s Michelle Binning.
Setting up just inside of the blue line, Farni blasted a shot towards the goal. Garcia knocked the puck down, but Harvard crashed the net and Spurling slammed home a rebound in the ensuing scrum to put the Crimson up, 2-1.
“There was a wide-open lane,” Farni said. “I waited for Spurling to get in front of the net, because that’s kind of my goal...to get it on net and put it in front of the net. So it worked out just as planned.”
Harvard convincingly controlled possession of the puck from that point on. While the Crimson did not score in the third period despite several powerplay opportunities, UConn was unable to generate any offense. Harvard’s dominance was most evident in the game’s final two minutes. With the Huskies desperately looking for an opportunity to pull Garcia and get a sixth skater on the ice, the Crimson successfully kept the puck away and ran out the clock to finish off the win.
“I loved how we played in the third period,” Stone said. “Our puck possession was excellent...attacking them was much better...Overall, I liked how we dictated play.”
Harvard now heads into reading and exam periods, followed by Winter Break, and will not see action until Jan. 8 when it travels to Princeton for a conference matchup.

The No. 2 University of Minnesota hadn’t been shut out since Nov. 17, 2007, and had beaten Harvard in the team’s previous five meetings—including in the 2004 and 2005 National Championships. But it couldn’t get the puck past Crimson senior goaltender Christina Kessler on Friday and Saturday.
“Kessler played out of her mind this weekend,” junior forward Katherine Chute said. “She saved us so many times.”
The Gophers came into the game averaging nearly four goals per game. Seven players entered with ten points or more. But none of the seven increased their tally, as Kessler made 24 saves on Friday in a 1-0 win for No. 6 Harvard, and repeated her performance in Saturday’s 0-0 tie, making 29 saves.
“When Harvard needed her to make a big save, she did,” Minnesota coach Brad Frost wrote in an email.
Kessler became the NCAA’s all-time career save percentage leader in the process.
“She doesn’t go out there thinking about wanting to get the save percentage up,” Buesser said. “She just takes it one game at a time. You don’t get there by thinking ahead. She’s very grounded in what she does.”
The senior’s consistency has allowed Harvard to play more aggressive on the offensive end, according to coach Katey Stone. That was certainly the case this weekend, as the Crimson twice outshot the Golden Gophers.
“Our forwards are taking the chances,” Kessler added. “[They’re] playing very tough, knowing we have reliable defense, knowing they can go the extra two steps.”
At her own end of the ice, Kessler’s position in the crease allows her to see things her teammates sometimes can’t, and the senior is quick to pass on her observations to her teammates.
“She sees everything that’s going on,” co-captain Cori Bassett said. “She’s always talking. She’s always helping us.”
Against Minnesota, the defense responded, helping Kessler to the two shutouts.
“My hat’s off to my defense,” Kessler said.
Still, as Bassett conceded, in a fast paced game, the defense was unable to follow all of Kessler’s instructions. But whenever that happened, the goaltender came up with the saves.
“[Kessler’s] an unbelievable player all-around,” Buesser said. “She saves our butt sometimes.”
And the senior is having a great time doing it.
“I’ve really enjoyed every single game, every single practice,” Kessler said. “I hope the fun continues.”
Recently, the good times have been rolling for Kessler, who has twice been named the ECAC Goaltender of the Week.
“I don’t really care too much about the stats,” she said. “It’s a goalie’s job to keep the pucks from going in the net. I just focus on one shot at a time. As long as the team is winning, that’s all I’m concerned about.”
Before this weekend, the Crimson’s only victory against a ranked opponent had come on Nov. 7 against then-No. 7 St. Lawrence. And the rest of the top ten had given Harvard a ton of difficulty—the Crimson tied New Hampshire, but lost to both Clarkson and Princeton.
So the Gophers looked like they would be trouble. Like the Crimson, Minnesota boasts a talented goaltender in Noora Raty, a member of the Finnish National team.
“Us and Harvard are very similar, in that we both have fast teams, work extremely hard and both teams have outstanding goaltending,” Frost wrote in an email.
Raty lived up to the billing, making 39 saves against the Crimson on Saturday, and only letting the puck past her on one shot all weekend, with the lone score coming from Harvard junior Liza Ryabkina.
“Generally when you only give up one goal on the weekend, you would expect to come out with a win or two,” Frost wrote.
But this weekend, one goal wasn’t going to cut it. Not with Kessler in the opposing net.
“[It’s a] huge testament to Kessler’s focus and intensity,” Stone said. “That’s exactly what we needed her to do.”

Everyone deserves a second chance.
The Harvard men’s basketball team will get its second opportunity to knock off an elite non-conference opponent tonight when it travels to Chesnut Hill to take on Boston College.
Last Sunday the Crimson visited No. 13 Connecticut and, sparked by co-captain Jeremy Lin’s 30 points, came within six points of an upset.
Tonight, Harvard is looking to do more than just hang around with its opponent.
“Our kids can’t be feeling sorry for themselves,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “We’ll have our chances coming up at BC, and I’m hopeful that we’ll be excited on the one hand and then determined on the other...We’ve shown we can battle and compete and play with an opponent like [UConn] this year, and now let’s show that we can do that and win—and I’m hopeful that’s the mindset of our kids.”
Boston College is thankful to have a second chance of its own: another shot to defeat the Crimson.
Last season, Harvard handed the then-No. 17 Eagles an embarrassing 12-point loss, just days after the Eagles had defeated then-No. 1 North Carolina.
But this time around it may be more difficult for the Crimson to sneak up on the Eagles and come away with another upset.
“You know BC is not going to take this game lightly,” said Jeff Goodman, a senior college basketball writer for FOXSports.com. “These guys want Harvard this year. This is a game they’ve almost circled on their calendar.”
“We’re not going to catch anybody,” Amaker said. “I’m sure there’s been talk of that sort all year with students and fans and players, so I’d assume that there will be a very good crowd for them and I’m sure that their mind set will be focused on Harvard.”
On top of the Eagles’ sense of determination, the Crimson will also be forced to deal with a very talented basketball team.
Coming off wins over Providence, Michigan, and previously undefeated Miami, Boston College sports an athletic lineup.
Despite graduating their leading scorer from a year ago, Tyrese Rice, and carrying an injury to their talented wing, Rakim Sanders, the Eagles have managed to post an impressive 73.8 points per game.
Boston College is led by a duo of wing players, 6’6 junior Corey Raji and 6’3 sophomore Reggie Jackson, both of whom average at least 15 points and nearly eight rebounds per game.
“[Their wing players] are big and strong and physical, so we’re going to have our hands full,” Amaker said. “Our perimeter and our guards are really going to have to play good post defense.”
Luckily for Harvard, the Eagles will likely be without Sanders, their third-leading scorer from a year ago, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the team’s third game. After the weekend’s contest against Miami, Sanders told Goodman that he did not expect to return until the Eagles’ game against Rhode Island on Sunday. Nonetheless, the Crimson have been preparing as if Sanders will be in the lineup.
For Harvard to emerge victorious from tonight’s game, the Crimson will need to receive offensive production both Lin and his supporting cast. When Harvard defeated Boston College a season ago, Lin put up an impressive stat line of 27 points, eight assists, and six steals, but two other players contributed double-digit scoring nights as well, including guard Oliver McNally—now a sophomore—who dropped 17 points.
In the Crimson’s latest loss to UConn, McNally was largely absent, scoring zero points on zero-for-six shooting while freshmen wingmen Christian Webster and Dee Giger uncharacteristically shot a combined one-for-seven from behind the arc.
“I think it’s important that we have to hit on a few if not all cylinders to win a game like that,” Amaker said. “[Lin] was sensational but it was hard to find multiple guys giving us the kind of production we need to get to pull a game like that out.”
Although a second option failed to emerge in the Crimson’s previous matchup, the team is filled with potential suitors for the role. Seven players this season have scored in double figures, and Harvard will be hoping that two or three of them can hit shots and help the Crimson return to Cambridge with a major victory.

Put a whole lot of undergraduates who've spent 20 hours a week on problem sets in one room and you're bound to get, well, awesomeness.
At least that's what FlyBy thought when we descended upon Northwest Labs Tuesday to take a look the CS50 Fair, which easily fielded about 200 people at any given moment in a techno-playing, popcorn-scented technological bonanza.
Find out about some of the projects we saw, including ISawYouHarvard.com, after the jump.
What took the show in pre-fair publicity was I Saw You Harvard, a missed connections Web site created by Tej A. Toor '10 named after the larger site isawyou.com.
"I didn't expect it to be so popular," she said. "I submitted my project at 11 and expected to be done with it, but I ended up staying up and working on it."
Since Monday, the site's accumulated over 500 posts. Sorting through and moderating the posts have been a chore, said Toor, who said she's "trying to keep it clean and keep it well-intentioned."
Her favorite post? This one from the Mather Dining Hall Tuesday at 2:43 p.m.: "I saw you...wearing a cookie monster hat with your big glasses. you are the cutest guy [I] have ever seen."
"This is the sort of thing the Web site should be about," she said.
But I Saw You Harvard was not the only project on display. Projects ranged from tools to test musical frequencies to a service by Julia S. Howland '12 that sends you realtime sports information. Text "gocrim" followed by a sport to 41411 (the same number as ShuttleBoy) and you'll get information on latest scores and times.
Meanwhile, Randy J. Miller '13 made an iPhone app that contains a course catalog, a map of Harvard buildings, and a collection of Harvard-related RSS feeds. It still has bugs, he says, but he's hoping to work on it over J-term and expand it to include ShuttleBoy, a Harvard directory, a list of WiFi spots, and a way to check your Crimson cash. Whether that catalog app will be ready in time for spring shopping period, though, is doubtful, but, he adds, it's not his fault.
"Apple sucks, man," he said.
