After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It only took one competition for Harvard rookie Chris Stock to prove himself to be among the top junior skiers in the nation. By finishing the US Cross Country Championships as the 13th ranked junior, Stock qualified to race in the junior national championships taking place later this year.
"To have him at the top of the field is just phenomenal," said Crimson Nordic coach Chris City '94.
The freshman's performance was the highlight of a strong outing by the Harvard ski team at the event that took place in Rumford, Maine, throughout last week.
Stock got off to a fast start by placing ninth among juniors in his first event, the sprint event.
"Everybody races the same course and they take the fastest 30 people and break," Stock explained. "I wasn't in the top 30, but they had another set of heats for juniors, born in 1991 or later. The top 12 juniors moved on. I was in that; I qualified 7th for that and then moved up in the heats to fourth. That translated to 9th [overall among juniors], when you included the juniors who were in the top 30...I was very happy."
Final rankings are determined by taking each skier's best two races, and Stock had thought that his second event, the 15k classic race, would be his next best shot at placing well.
"I've historically been a much stronger classic skier," he said. "My [15k] classic race was not what I was hoping for."
The disappointing result meant that Stock would have to qualify for junior nationals through the freestyle, or "skate" race—historically not his strong point.
"Last season I really did not have good skate results," Stock said. "I've been working on my skate with my coach. I've definitely been making improvements."
Those improvements manifested themselves in a 10th place finish in the junior men's 10k freestyle event.
The finish was enough to vault Stock up to 13th overall and qualify him for the junior national championships.
While Stock set the tone for the Crimson skiers, sophomores Alena Tofte and Esther Kennedy posted strong finishes of their own. The pair finished 35th and 36th, respectively, in the junior girls' 5k freestyle race. Rookie Jen Rolfes was 59th.
The day before Tofte had placed 54th in the women's 10k classic event.
"Watching her, it's clear she's made a jump of speed from last year," City said. "It's fun to see her really hold her own."
While some of the race results were encouraging, City noted that the team is more focused on the collegiate season. Stock noted that the team is optimistic about the upcoming season.
"I've definitely seen a pretty strong work ethic and a mentality that really suggests that the guys on the team want to go out and make a lot of improvements," Stock said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—Conventional wisdom says that you can’t win the Ivy League in the opening weeks of conference play—but you can lose it. Thankfully for the Harvard men’s basketball team, its dreams of a league championship remain very much intact after beating Dartmouth (4-10, 0-1 Ivy), 68-53, yesterday afternoon at Leede Arena in Hanover, N.H., in the first conference game of the season.
“We’ve been gearing up for conference play,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “[Our veterans have been] trying to make sure that our players, especially our younger guys, understand what it means to be in conference, what it means to be on the road in the league. There’s no question that we were ready to play.”
Harvard (11-3, 1-0) was able to use its defense and size to prevent the Big Green from springing an upset, but Dartmouth kept the contest competitive for most of the afternoon.
Big Green forward David Rufful had the hot hand to start the game. The big man hit a three from the left wing to open the scoring for Dartmouth and added another triple less than a minute later. His layup roughly seven minutes into the action tied the score, 8-8, but the Big Green would not come any closer to grabbing the lead.
Over the next seven minutes, the Crimson went on a 12-1 run in which junior co-captain Keith Wright scored five points and sophomore guard Brandyn Curry chipped in four.
Dartmouth cut the lead to six points with three minutes remaining in the period, but a layup by junior co-captain Oliver McNally, a dunk by sophomore forward Kyle Casey, and a deep three pointer by freshman forward Laurent Rivard in the waning seconds of the half gave Harvard a comfortable 32-21 lead at halftime.
“We had a nice margin. I think a lot of that was the defensive effort to start the game and certainly that end of half situation, that big shot by Laurent,” Amaker said.
The Crimson’s defense set the tone in the first frame, allowing its opponent just 30.4 percent shooting from the field and forcing eight turnovers.
“The number one thing with our identity is we are going to defend,” Amaker said. “That was really the key for us.”
Harvard picked up where it left off in the second half. After a three by Big Green guard Jabari Trotter, Wright posted up and connected on a hook shot. The next time down, the co-captain fed his front-court mate Casey cutting through the middle of the lane for a two-handed slam.
Casey, who is recovering from a broken foot suffered in the preseason, had his most explosive game to date. The sophomore grabbed nine rebounds and scored 13 points, including three thunderous dunks that became his trademark a season ago.
“You saw some of the explosiveness that we’ve seen in the past,” Amaker said. “As the game went on, he had more and more confidence.”
“It takes a big burden off my shoulders because we have another guy that can come in as a big and fill in that role and put some points on the board,” Wright said.
Teaming up with Casey, Wright dominated the post. He tallied a team-high 16 points and 12 rebounds for his sixth double-double of the year. On the game, the Crimson outrebounded Dartmouth, 32-22, and outscored it in the paint, 38-16.
“Winning the matchup in the post is a big part of every game,” Wright said. ”Coach stresses getting the ball inside-out.”
Harvard’s lead swelled to 17 after a short bank shot from sophomore guard Christian Webster midway through the frame, but the Big Green responded with a 10-2 run. A deep three by Rivard ended the threat, and the Crimson’s lead never dipped below 12 points for the rest of the contest as it cruised to its first conference win of the season, 68-53.
“They played really hard. We always know this team is going to come out and play hard,” Wright said. “It’s especially tough to win here.”
Under Amaker, Harvard has struggled at Leede Arena. The Crimson escaped with narrow victories, 62-58 and 63-62, in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In Amaker’s first season, Harvard lost handily in Hanover, 73-56.
“We really focused in,” Wright said. “Coach made sure that we were all concentrating…we had to be efficient and execute.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four periods into its two-match road trip, the Harvard women’s hockey team had scored six unanswered goals.
But then the tide began to turn against the Crimson.
After soundly defeating Union, 5-0, on Friday, Harvard (6-7-2, 5-3-2 ECAC) failed to hold onto an early 1-0 lead yesterday at Rensselaer (8-7-6, 6-3-1), falling 2-1 in Troy, N.Y. In the process, the Engineers overtook the Crimson for the fourth spot in the ECAC rankings.
“Overall, it was a good hockey game,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Both teams fought hard and [had] good goaltending…but [Rensselaer was] one better than we were today.”
The contest began well for the Crimson. A little over eleven minutes into the first period, senior forward Katharine Chute charged down the ice and found classmate Ashley Wheeler.
Thanks to tri-captain Kate Buesser’s check of a Rensselaer defender, Wheeler had an open shot, whipping the puck past the Rensselaer goaltender to give Harvard the early advantage.It was the senior’s first goal of the season.
“Something we’ve been working on…is attacking the net more with our players and getting in the goalies’ faces,” Buesser said. “That’s exactly what we did.”
The second period looked like a different match all together. After being outshot 7-4 in the first frame, the Engineers turned the tables on the Crimson, tallying 12 shots in the ensuing period, while Harvard managed only four.
The Rensselaer barrage finally paid off at the 13:41 mark, when Engineer forward Taylor Horton fired a shot past Crimson sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy to even the score at one apiece.
The home team could have done even more damage in the second period had Harvard not killed two penalties. In the latter power play, Rensselaer held a 5-on-3 edge but failed to make anything of the opportunity, only managing one shot on goal.
In total, the Crimson stopped the Engineers on all six of its power plays, despite the fact that for much of the season, penalty kills have been Harvard’s weakness. The team’s kill percentage of 74.6 is the second-worst in the nation.
“[We] did a really good job of killing penalties today,” Stone said. “[We] read and anticipated and pressured when they needed to.”
“We were waiting for them to make a mistake and us to pounce on it, and that’s what we did,” Buesser added. “There were some gutsy plays by our kids out there.”
But in the final frame, despite killing another two penalties, the Crimson couldn’t keep the score tied at one. With 10:23 left to play, Rensselaer defender Andie LeDonne grabbed the puck near the Engineers goal, dashed down the ice and fired a slap shot past Bellamy to give the home team the 2-1 lead.
The second score proved to be the decisive one. Despite outshooting Rensselaer in the final period 8-5, Harvard failed to come back, giving the Engineers a one-goal victory.
Part of the Crimson offensive woes can be attributed to the strong play of Engineer goaltender Sonja van der Bliek, who only let one of Harvard’s 19 shots into the net.
“You have to hand it to [Rensselaer’s] goaltender,” Buesser said. “She played an unbelievable game.”
Though the Crimson’s Bellamy let in one more score than her Rensselaer counterpart, she too had a solid game between the pipes.
“[Bellamy] played very well all weekend,” Stone said. “It was a tough second goal, but other than that she was solid.”
On the offensive side, though Harvard didn’t light up the scoreboard, it kept the Rensselaer defenders and goaltender busy all night.
“They don’t have a score sheet for really close chances,” Buesser said. “If we did, we’d be filling that column a lot.”
And though close doesn’t count in hockey, the Harvard coach was nevertheless pleased with the team’s effort.
“There were a lot of good things…but we just need to keep getting better," Stone said. “It’s just going to take a little bit of time.”
