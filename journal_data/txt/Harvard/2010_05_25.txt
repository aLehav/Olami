Harvard University Health Services will be contributing $8,000 toward construction of a secondary school in Haiti after nearly two thirds of the 2,500 students who completed this year’s student health assessment chose to donate to the effort.
This year marked the first time that students were offered a monetary incentive to complete the health assessment survey, which was e-mailed to undergraduates in late March and is administered every other year.
Students were given the option of making a $5 donation to The Orphanage and School at Grison-Garde, Haiti or receiving a $5 gift card to J.P. Licks.
Raymond Ford, the charity’s founder, said that the Harvard donation would be critical in financing the completion of a new secondary school building in time for the fall.
The orphanage currently houses and feeds about 70 children, and the school expects to support about 700 local students this September, according to Ford.
He said that the Jan. 12 earthquake displaced so many Haitian citizens to cities near Grison-Garde that funds had to be diverted away from the construction of the secondary school in order to care for an influx of new orphans and students.
The resulting budget shortfall will be almost entirely offset by the Harvard donation, Ford said.
“When you talk about the importance of secondary education, it may mean everything to some of them,” Ford said.
He added that secondary education is correlated with lower rates of HIV infection and unwanted pregnancy in poor women, as well as higher employment rates among both men and women.
UHS officials selected Ford’s charity at the suggestion of UHS chief of pediatrics Maureen Lynch, who has been volunteering in Haiti for the past 10 years at a medical clinic near the orphanage.
“We see the kids from the orphanage in the clinic, and when you feed and educate these kids, they are beautiful and thriving,” Lynch wrote in an e-mail.
Director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling Paul J. Barreira added that he was surprised and pleased that so many Harvard students chose to donate their reward to the efforts in Haiti.
“Because we never offered this option in the past, we had no idea how many students would choose the donation,” Barreira wrote in an e-mailed statement. “We are delighted that the $8,000 will make such a huge difference.”

Harvard Square’s Oona’s Experienced Clothing will close this summer for renovations before reopening in August under new management.
For the last 38 years, the vintage clothing shop located on Mass. Avenue between Bow and Arrow Streets, has been privately owned and operated by Kathleen M. White.
White had been interested in selling Oona’s months before Ellie Mueller, a longtime patron, unexpectedly approached her with an offer earlier this year.
“I’m 68, and I want to retire,” White said.
“Ellie’s been shopping here since she was 14. When she approached me with an offer, I was excited to sell the store to someone with knowledge of the vintage clothing industry,” she added.
Oona’s first opened doors in the Square in 1972 and later opened stores in Boston, Newburyport, and Provincetown, White said.
Though the locations outside of Cambridge eventually had to be shut down, White continued to operate out of the original store in the Square.
According to White, Oona’s is busiest in the weeks directly preceding Halloween and other annual themed parties at Harvard and other local universities.
“The good stuff usually sells out within two weeks of arriving, but everything’s gone within a month or two,” she said.
Oona’s boasts a dedicated clientele who often return with family and friends many years later, White said.
“This store is pretty much the same place it was in 1972,” she said. “Some of my original clients have come back with their grandchildren and told me that the store is exactly how they remember it 30 years ago.”
Mueller said she plans to maintain much of the store’s characteristic milieu while improving the overall experience for customers.
“I’m obviously a huge fan of Oona’s, but sometimes it’s hard to find what you’re looking for,” she said. “With the renovation, we’re hoping to improve that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Adam B. Wheeler’s arraignment last week, Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney John C. Verner called Wheeler’s penchant for lying “pathological.”
Wheeler, a former Harvard student who allegedly fabricated letters of recommendation, transcripts, and SAT scores, has pled not guilty to 20 criminal charges.
Prosecutors accuse Wheeler of lying frequently and egregiously over a period of at least three years. Verner said that Wheeler’s compulsive behavior would not have stopped had his parents not intervened.
According to psychologists, the label “pathological” suits the nature of Wheeler’s alleged crimes, but the term cannot be definitively applied without further analysis of the defendant’s personality.
Carolyn Saarni, a psychologist and member of the American Psychological Association, defined pathological lying as “almost compulsive. There is very little moral discomfort about doing so.”
Such behavior typically begins at a young age with minor fibs, according to Shelley H. Carson, a Harvard psychology lecturer. When the liar finds that he or she is able to deceive without being caught, the lies grow bolder, Carson said.
“They start out with very small lies and self-aggrandizing lies, and they don’t get caught, [but] they get rewarded with social prestige and status,” she said.
In Wheeler’s case, she said, “I think his reward is probably self esteem... ‘Here I am, a Harvard student.’ He has to know somewhere in his mind he didn’t do what other people did to get into Harvard.”
Saarni said that Wheeler’s story sounds like “a major case of self-aggrandizement... A person who is a pathological liar lies to protect their self interest...to look bigger than one actually feels.”
Carson said that, in addition to desiring immediate gratification—the “shot of dopamine” that the liar receives from successful deceit—pathological liars are less likely to be dissuaded by the threat of punishment.
She pointed out that Wheeler continued to lie in his applications to Yale, Brown, and McLean Hospital, even after being dismissed from both Bowdoin College in Maine—where he spent his first two undergraduate years—and Harvard for academic dishonesty.
Because of this lack of regard for consequences, Carson said that prison sentences are not always effective in curtailing psychopathic behavior.
“So far, rehabilitation hasn’t been successful with the psychopath,” she said. “They’re wired differently.”
Carson described several studies which have suggested biological differences in psychopaths’ brain structures.
“I don’t want to characterize Adam Wheeler as a psychopath,” Carson said, adding that she would need to interview him herself in order to make a diagnosis. “However, I would say that he’s displaying the same type of pattern.”
Steven A. Sussman, Wheeler’s attorney, declined to comment for this article.

Stephen W. Fesik, professor of biochemistry, pharmocology, and chemistry at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine, presented audience members with a series of proteins that bind to other proteins and may serve as viable treatments for cancer patients in the future at yesterday’s 14th Andrew H. Weinberg Memorial Lecture at Harvard Medical School.
Fesik, who is also a member of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, presented strategies to design potential cancer drugs that work based on protein-protein interactions.
In structure-based drug design, the three-dimensional structure of the designated biological target determines the components of the treatment while fragment-based approaches in drug discovery employ physical techniques to determine how fragments bind to protein targets.
Fesik highlighted the importance of fragment-based approaches and their advantages in the creation of new drugs.
“Fragment-based screening involves highly-focused chemistry,” he said. “It tailors molecules to bind to a protein target of interest and covers more chemical space, while identifying hits not obtained in other screens.”
Fesik said that his research had encountered some skepticism, as other scientists’ previous attempts to create treatments dependent on protein-protein interactions have failed. To combat this perception of the direction his research took, he outlined pre-clinical activities and the multiple approaches to treatment employed in their studies, which he said improved the odds of success.
“We are trying to identify useful lead molecules and compounds in clinical trials,” he said. “My lab is focused on developing improvements in fragment-based approaches and applying them to target proteins involved in protein-protein interactions.”
Fesik’s presentation is part of an annual series named for a young patient at the Harvard affiliate Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who died of a rare muscle tumor. The lectures aim to facilitate discussion between medical professionals, policy-makers, and clinicians about new approaches and theories in cancer treatment.

Harvard Law School professor Michael J. Klarman said he chose to wear a suit to the Law School’s inaugural “HLS Thinks Big” for no other reason than to celebrate the Red Sox’s winning streak.
Despite his lighthearted allusion to Boston’s baseball team, Klarman spoke about the unexpected backlashes associated with a different kind of winning streak—legal verdicts favorable for progressives, such as in Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade.
Klarman was one of five Law School lecturers and professors who delivered 10-minute speeches on a variety of topics within their respective areas of expertise as part of the event.
Law School professor Carol Steiker ’82 spoke on the possibility of the death penalty’s abolition within the United States.
“Will the United States ever get rid of the death penalty? Probably not in my lifetime or my children’s lifetime. But there’s the possibility for it to go away,” she said, citing what she called a “precipitous decline” in the number of American executions after 1999.
In their speeches, lecturer Robert Greenwald focused on what he described as the unfortunate fact that so many Americans still are uninsured and are denied access to health care, Professor John G. Palfrey ’94 spoke on the concept of “interoperability,” and Law Professor David A Grossman discussed topics related to his research on advocacy.
The forum was designed in the style of both the annual Technology, Entertainment, and Design talks and the “Harvard Thinks Big” program held earlier this year, at which professors also delivered 10-minute speeches on subjects within their respective areas of expertise.
Law School Dean Martha Minow said, however, that “HLS Thinks Big” was not necessarily a response to “Harvard Thinks Big” and had been planned before the other event.
“As a new leader, one of the questions I dealt with is how do we make clear that [the Law School] is a learning environment—how do we make the work and research people do here available to the larger community,” she said.
At the event’s conclusion, Minow posed a series of questions to the panel of five professors, one of which dealt with the common theme of “comparison” in their speeches. Some legal scholars insist that comparing United States law with foreign law—such as that of the E.U.—is unwarranted, but the general consensus among the participants at the event was that trans-legal comparisons are essential.
Palfrey evoked Emerson’s adage that one needs to travel to foreign shores to understand the nature of one’s own.
Around 100 Law School students, professors, and Harvard affiliates attended the event.

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health recently discovered a link between the consumption of a common class of infertility drug while pregnant and the birth of autistic children.
The study, presented last Wednesday at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Philadelphia, found that women who had taken ovulation-inducing drugs, either orally or through injections, were at almost twice the risk of giving birth to children who develop autism compared to women who had not taken any fertility drugs. The risk of autism increased with the time the mothers underwent such fertility treatments.
A history of infertility was also found to be associated with autism disorders.
This is the first study to examine the potential relationship of ovulation-inducing drugs and autism, according to Kristen H. Lyall, the study’s lead investigator and a post-doc at the School of Public Health.
Lyall cautioned against jumping to conclusions, as the results are “very preliminary.”
“It would be irresponsible to create anxiety in the thousands of women who are currently pregnant as a result of OID use,” said School of Public Health professor and the study’s senior investigator Alberto Ascherio.
Using data from the Nurses Health Study II, the researchers analyzed almost 4,000 women, looking for women who took OID before their first pregnancy whose children developed autism and adjusting for age of the mothers, pregnancy complications, and other autism risk factors.
Data was obtained only through questionnaires, so the researchers were unable to verify other potential factors such as the subjects’ medical histories, the timing of fertility treatment, or the onset of autism in the children.
Despite the limitations, Lyall said that the link between ovulation inducing drugs, history of infertility, and autism merits further investigation.
Other anecdotal and animal studies have also pointed to increased numbers of autistic children whose mothers had used assisted fertility, said Patricia A. Davis ’84, a pediatrician at Harvard-affiliate Mass. General Hospital who is also conducting research on fertility treatment and autism.
“This a very complex question, and we’re just beginning to get information,” Davis said. “We need to tease out whether [the autism risk] is associated with the age or the mother or father, or genetic risk, etc.”

The number of Harvard seniors who intend to join the workforce next year and have found employment by graduation rose from 58 percent last year to nearly two-thirds for the Class of 2010, according to The Crimson’s fourth annual senior survey.
The uptick comes as the broader U.S. economy shows signs of recovery following last year’s devastating financial crisis, but the figure still marks a drop from 2007, when 73.2 percent of such graduates had finalized employment plans by the time they left the Yard.
The high-paying finance and consulting sectors, which just three years ago hired 47 percent of seniors intending to work right after graduation, came in comparatively low at 30.52 percent, though that figure represents a rise from 20 percent last year, when companies slashed hiring levels as Wall Street grappled with the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression.
After finance and consulting, education clocked in as the third most-popular field, drawing 13.7 percent of graduates planning to enter the workforce, likely reflecting the recruiting success of programs such as Teach for America, which reported last month that 17 percent of this year’s class had applied to its two-year teaching program.
The percentage of seniors planning to work this year also rose slightly from 59.7 percent to 61.4 percent, while the proportion applying to graduate school fell by a corresponding amount from 24.6 to 22.9, though these changes were not statistically significant. Last year saw an increase in students headed for graduate school and a decrease in the number looking for jobs, as seniors faced the bleakest employment prospects in recent memory.
But if Harvard students are having more success in the job market this year, they still report that employment is not always coming in their “dream” fields. Less than a third of students planning to work a job in finance indicated that sector as the field they would have entered if salary were not a concern. The same was true for around half of future consultants.
A plurality of Harvard seniors said they would choose to work in public service if not burdened by financial concerns, with 16.86 percent indicating it as their “dream” field, while 13.95 percent indicated their interest in the artse. Just 4 percent of seniors planning to work next year said they would actually end up in the arts. 11 percent of the class said the same of public service.
For the second year in a row, Boston remained the post-graduate destination of choice for Harvard seniors, with 24.4 percent of the class citing it as their home-to-be, but New York rated a very close second, drawing 24.3 percent of seniors, after falling last year to just one-fifth of the class.  A tenth of the class will be heading to California, and a little over 5 percent will take up residence in Washington D.C.
Around 17 percent of seniors said they would be living outside the United States next year, with Europe drawing the highest number of Harvard graduates at 7.3 percent. 4.5 percent of the graduating class will head for Asia, and 1 percent will live in Africa next year.
The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2010 was conducted through a secure website that ensured only one response per senior. Over 500 members of the Class of 2010 responded to the survey between May 15 and May 21, 2010. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percent.

Few Harvard students see themselves as very conservative, either on campus or more broadly.

The number of graduating seniors who identify as gay nearly doubled from freshman year to senior year. The number of students who self-identified as bisexual and neither gay, straight, nor bisexual also grew over the same time period. The data reflect responses to questions in last week's survey asking how respondents identified at the beginning of college and how they identify today.

Rachel Esplin Odell ’10 came very close to missing her own engagement.
It was reading period of her junior year at Harvard, and Rachel had three papers due in succession. She stayed up all night completing a 25-page essay, raced to turn it in, and sped off to the airport to fly to Washington, D.C. to visit her boyfriend, Georgetown student and Utah native Scott Odell.
She missed the flight.
Luckily, she got a seat on the next plane and arrived in Washington, where her boyfriend took her on a tour of the White House—and then proposed to her in the Rose Garden.
The couple met in the summer of 2008 at a Church of Latter Day Saints event in the capital, where Rachel had an internship and Scott was taking summer classes. They started dating soon afterward, and about a year later, they were married at the Mormon Temple in Idaho Falls, Rachel’s hometown.
“It was a beautiful day, just perfect,” Rachel recalled. “We believe that if we’re married in the temple, we’ll be together forever, not just ‘til death do us part.’”
They spent their honeymoon in Thailand, then continued on to China, where Rachel completed research for her thesis on China’s involvement in the World Trade Organization and Scott worked for a nonprofit firm.
Scott took a semester off from Georgetown to live in Boston with Rachel while she completed her final semester at Harvard. “We didn’t want to do the long-distance thing anymore when we were married,” Rachel says. Since she had taken five classes in the second semester of her freshman year, Rachel was able to arrange her schedule so that she could graduate in December of her senior year.
“Now, looking back on it, it was fortunate that it all worked out. I personally feel that it was a great blessing,” she said. “It made it work out for our marriage. I feel it was kind of providence guiding my path.”
Since Rachel’s graduation, the couple has been living in Washington. Scott is finishing his junior year at Georgetown—though he is older than Rachel, he took time off from college to serve a Mormon mission in Mississippi—while Rachel translates research papers from Chinese to English and works as a research assistant to a Chinese studies professor at Georgetown. Next year, she will hold a one-year fellowship with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Rachel also says she was lucky to experience engagement and marriage at the same time as one of her close friends. Her roommate Stephanie Brinton ’10 got engaged within two weeks of Rachel, and the roommates’ weddings were just two weeks apart.
“It was nice to have someone to go through the whole wedding planning process with,” Rachel said.

This Thursday, faculty and graduates will don colorful academic regalia for Commencement morning exercises. The profusion of colors, hoods, and hats may leave you wondering if there's some method to this madness. We present a guide to the history of the Commencement dress code with instructions on interpreting all the colors and adornments.
The dress for faculty and graduate students can be complex. Their robes include a black hood lined on the inside with the colors of the institution from which they graduated. Their hood signifies their previous degrees, with the longest, four-foot hoods denoting holders of doctorate degrees. Harvard’s color is crimson, while Yale’s is blue and Princeton’s is orange with a black chevron.
For faculty members with a Ph.D. from other universities, their hood may also have a trimming color denoting the area in which they received their previous degree: arts, letters, humanities have white trimmings, law has purple  trimmings, and medicine has green trimmings. This trimming is not found on Harvard graduates' robes, however.
Since undergraduates don't  have a degree yet, they don't have crimson-lined hoods attached to their  robes.
The Academic Costume Code, which lays out these rules, also dictates that hats may have tassels, which may be draped either left or right regardless of whether the degree has been conferred on not yet during the ceremony.
Doctorate holders have added privileges. They can tie gold tassels to their hats and drape robes colored based on their institution of graduation. Harvard’s doctorate robes are crimson with black stripes on the arms. Further, faculty members who graduated from foreign universities are permitted to wear their often more extravagant—even fur-layered—regalia and hats from their previous institutions.
In addition to these  standards, all robes of Harvard degree recipients include one unique  feature included to make our gowns especially distinct: the crow’s-feet  emblems sewn onto the lapels. The insignia are colored based on the Harvard faculty from which the student graduates and follow the same colors used for hood trimmings at other universities.
Academic dress found at the commencement ceremonies for universities in the United States is really old school—that is, it originated from the medieval dress of scholars at universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. Academic regalia at Harvard have followed a long history and now largely conform to the Academic Costume Code. But Harvard has its own history on academic dress and continues to retain key elements that differentiate it from the widely-accepted code.

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 26, 2010
An earlier version of the May 25 FlyBy post "Graduation Robes, Explained" incorrectly stated that Harvard hoods include the trimmings based on field-of-study. According to Tara Benedict, an executive assistant in the Harvard Marshall's Office, "[Harvard's] hoods are not marked for any specific field of study.” However, for faculty graduating from other universities, the hood corresponds with the school from which they received their highest degree.

Throughout the past week, we've been pulling snippets  from The Crimson archives to commemorate the coming class reunions. This is the last installment of the series.
This year marks the 25th reunion  of the class of 1985, a class that not only witnessed the original rise  of side ponytails and leggings, but also contended with a newly raised drinking age, the possibility of censorship of the CUE guide, and the  daunting challenges brought on by the new computing era.
1985  brought Harvard into the future with increasing computerization.  That  year, The Crimson reported that the Harvard University Library system had taken  the first step by using computers to keep track of its acquisitions—a move they said might one day allow people to peruse the  catalog from their bedrooms. In addition, Harvard Student Agencies started offering to type students'  papers on computers,  and thesis writers qualified for reduced rates at the Harvard Computing  Center, where they could use a computer that had the power to store up to 500 pages.
Meanwhile,  allegations flew that the administration was censoring CUE reports to  hide negative reviews of star professors,  which students decried as "censorship." The Undergraduate Council proposed that students should be in charge of  administering the CUE.
At  the same time, the University contended with new liability brought on  by the fact that the year before, the drinking age had been raised from  18 to 21 in Massachusetts. The University "made the decision to ban underage drinking" in the fall of 1985.  The change prompted a student editorialist to declare "The party's  over. The days of drinking are done."
