After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Diane E. Lopez — current deputy general counsel for the University — will be Harvard’s next vice president and general counsel, the University announced Friday.
Lopez will take over June 1 as current Senior Vice President and General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 departs for Gettysburg College to serve as the school’s next president. The University announced Iuliano’s decision to leave the University on Jan. 30.
In a press release, Lopez said she is “grateful” for University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s trust and thanked Iuliano for his leadership.
“For 25 years, I’ve had the extraordinary privilege of working with terrific colleagues across Harvard to address legal challenges and help them to do what they do best. I’m honored now to have this opportunity, especially at a time when Harvard and higher education face legal issues that are so important,” Lopez said.
Bacow said in the release that Lopez has “a deep understanding of the complex array of laws and regulations” that impact institutions of higher education.
“Diane is an outstanding lawyer and colleague, admired across Harvard for her excellent judgment, her exemplary professionalism, her collaborative style, and her strong academic values,” Bacow said.
Lopez first came to Harvard in 1994 as a University attorney in the Office of General Counsel. Since 2011, Lopez has served as deputy general counsel under Iuliano, dealing with legal issues such as stem cell research, scientific misconduct, and student affairs, according to the release.
A graduate of Mount Holyoke College and Columbia Law School, Lopez spent eight years in New York City working at the international law firm O’Melveny & Myers, where she focused on commercial litigation and pro bono work.
Lopez said that in the coming years, the office’s work could receive both local and national attention.
“Here, almost every week you have something that you’re working on that is at least going to get attention in [T]he Crimson, as well as local and often national media attention,” Lopez said in the release. “We have many legal challenges, in part because Harvard is an iconic institution of higher education.”
Lopez will step in at a time when Harvard is facing a number of lawsuits, including a high-profile admissions case brought forth by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions that alleges the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admissions processes.
The case was tried in a Boston court in the fall, and federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs is expected to issue a ruling in the coming weeks. Some experts say the case has the potential to eventually be appealed to the Supreme Court.
Harvard is also facing two lawsuits brought by a group of parent organizations for national fraternities and sororities alongside one Harvard fraternity and three College students that challenge the College’s single gender social group sanctions. The sanctions, which took effect in 2017 with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, captaining varsity athletic teams, and receiving the College’s endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
With 25 years of experience, Lopez said working in the Office of General Counsel has been “exciting.”
“You get up every day and you think you know what you’re going to do that day, and then some item hits, and you’re off to the races doing something else,” Lopez said in the release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students, faculty, and staff huddled together before the steps of Memorial Church Friday evening, standing vigil for the victims of the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque attacks that left 49 dead.
Approximately 50 Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents gathered at the vigil, which the Harvard Islamic Society organized to give people an opportunity to process, grieve, pray, and reflect in the wake of the deadly tragedy. Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid, Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg of Harvard Hillel, and Reverend Jonathan L. Walton were among the attendees.
O’Dair said at the vigil that she shared in the grief of Muslim Harvard affiliates and that “we all have a responsibility to stand up for one another and for what is right and against bigotry.”
A gunman opened fire in two mosques in Christchurch while Muslim worshippers were in the midst of Jummah prayers Friday afternoon; Friday prayers hold special significance in Islam. In addition to the 49 deceased, the shootings left 48 injured. Prior to the attacks, the gunman, who self-identified as a white nationalist, published a manifesto online that called foreign immigrants a “threat” and cited white supremacists and President Donald Trump as a source of inspiration.
A 28-year-old man with Australian citizenship has been charged with murder in connection with the attacks and will face additional charges, according to New Zealand police.
Meherina Khan ’21, who was one of the student speakers at the vigil, said she woke up Friday morning to an outpouring of messages from friends and members of the Harvard Islamic Society.
“From then it’s been everyone being there to support each other and extending arms of support, a listening ear, and a shoulder to cry on,” she said.
Abdur-Rashid delivered the closing remarks at the vigil and urged attendees to continue to stand against bigotry, violence, and hate.
“If it takes meeting here every single night to remind myself and the community of the duty we have to not go to sleep on hate, so be it,” he said.
The Friday shooting is the most recent in a string of targeted violence against racial and religious minorities, including mass shootings at a Pittsburgh, Penn. synagogue in October and a Charleston, S.C. church in 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow penned a letter to United States Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) Tuesday calling on them to pass legislation to protect recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status programs.
The letter requests the senators work on a “permanent solution” to provide an “achievable path to citizenship” for DACA recipients, as well as further protections for TPS recipients, so that the United States can continue to attract and admit people from across the globe. Graham and Feinstein serve as chairperson and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, respectively.
“The strength and success of our nation is due to large part to our long history of attracting and welcoming families and individuals from every corner of the globe—the best and brightest, to be sure, but also those seeking a better life by fleeing persecution, natural disaster, and physical or economic insecurity,” Bacow wrote.
DACA is an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to live and work in the United States; roughly 65 Harvard affiliates were undocumented during the last academic year. TPS is a designation the U.S. Department of Homeland Security grants to certain foreign nationals who are unable to return to their country of citizenship due to unsafe circumstances like armed conflict or natural disaster.
Bacow noted in the letter that Harvard is made “better” because of the students, faculty, and staff that come to the University and the United States “for any number of reasons.”
In the letter, Bacow also mentions Jin K. Park ’18-’19, a Harvard senior and the first DACA-recipient to receive the Rhodes Scholarship. Park recently testified before a House Judiciary Committee Hearing on Immigration Policy in Washington, D.C., following the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle a series of programs preventing certain immigrants’ deportations.
Bacow said in the monthly faculty meeting last week that Harvard has connected Park with legal counsel from law firm WilmerHale, which is representing him pro-bono.
Bacow also wrote that the Harvard staff with TPS have contributed “meaningfully” to Harvard in a number of ways including working in dining halls, custodial roles, and information technology services.
He also wrote that he hopes he can help lawmakers reach a solution for DACA and TPS recipients.
“Dreamers and TPS recipients have for too long lived in uncertainty, anxiety, and fear about the future,” Bacow wrote. “While the courts have taken temporary actions to protect these populations, it is up to the Congress to lead on a permanent resolution.”
“Harvard is grateful for all of your past efforts and, with the 116th Congress now under way, I look forward to helping you any way I can,” he added.
This is not the first time that a Harvard president has sent letters to lawmakers to advocate for DACA and TPS recipients. Former University President Drew G. Faust co-wrote a letter with Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber in May 2018 that advocated for TPS recipients after the Trump administration's attempted to roll back protections.
Faust also wrote a letter in February 2018 detailing the contributions that Harvard employees protected under TPS have made to the University.
Bacow has taken to the nation’s capital to lobby on behalf TPS and DACA recipients multiple times since he took over as president. In February, Bacow met with U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), and Roy D. Blunt (R-Mo.) along with Representative Jim P. McGovern to discuss a variety of issues including DACA and TPS protections.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN — Harvard men's basketball has an opportunity this weekend to earn its first berth to the NCAA Tournament since 2015, challenging Penn in the Ivy semifinals at 12:30 PM on ESPNU. The Crimson is coming off a win over Columbia that simultaneously earned the program its seventh-ever Ivy League title. As the No. 1 seed for the second straight season, Harvard will hope to erase the bad memories of last season when it fell to the Quakers in the tournament final.
Bryce Aiken was named as an all-Ivy first-team selection this past week, while freshman Noah Kirkwood claimed Rookie of the Year honors. The former guard leads the Crimson with 21.8 points this season, while Kirkwood moved into the double-digit scoring column of late.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team dueled familiar Ivy League foe Dartmouth this weekend for a spot in the ECAC’s annual mid-March pilgrimage to Lake Placid, N.Y. In a best-of-three quarterfinal series, the No. 14 Crimson did not even require the third game, ending the Big Green’s season with a pair of victories at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Harvard (19-9-3, 13-7-2 ECAC) followed its 3-1 triumph on Friday with an emotional 4-3 overtime clincher the following evening, knocking off Dartmouth (13-17-4, 10-9-3) in the 13th clash in the past four seasons with its Hanover, N.H., counterpart — the most common opponent for the Crimson during that span.
With the series win, Harvard extends its home win streak to eight games and remains unbeaten (9-0-1) at the Bright in its last ten bouts. A pair of victories this weekend has furthered the team’s case for an at-large NCAA Tournament bid, even if its result in Lake Placid is unfruitful.
HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 3 (OT)
A back-and-forth affair did not produce a victor in regulation, so the teams headed to overtime notched at 3-3. The Big Green was determined to extend its ECAC playoff run, while Harvard recognized the danger of allowing a formidable team to take the series to an unpredictable game three.
Ultimately, the superior team prevailed. Two minutes into the extra frame, sophomore forward Jack Badini regained the puck at the boards below the left circle and shuffled a pass to linemate Nathan Krusko. The junior punched home a wrap-around goal, ending Dartmouth’s season and causing his teammates to spill over the boards to celebrate.
“Badini ended up coming up the wall with it,” Krusko recounted. “I just kind of took it to the net, ended up looking off [Frédéric Grégoire] in front, going around the back door, and I was lucky enough that it went in five-hole…. It’s always nice to finally be able to pitch in, especially in a moment like that.”
Thanks to the Crimson’s win to open the series, the Big Green’s season was on the line Saturday night, and the team’s performance out of the gate reflected as much. Before the contest was three minutes old, Dartmouth had already potted two pucks.
Just one minute into the game, an offensive-zone faceoff win from junior forward Ryan Blankemeier resulted in a screened point shot finding its way past the Harvard goal line. Sophomore defenseman Brendan Demler was the culprit on the golf-style shot. A shift later, sophomore forward Quin Foreman’s shanked one-timer ended up being a perfect cross-crease feed for freshman linemate Drew O’Connor, who buried his chance.
With his strike on Saturday, O’Connor added to his ECAC lead in tallies by a rookie with 17. He finishes his debut campaign ranked second in Division I among first-year goal-scorers.
“We were forced to respond to their compete level in the first period,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “That’s a very good team — a very proud team…. Our goaltender made some saves there to keep it 2-0 and to keep it 2-1, that might easily be overlooked.”
In a two-score hole, Harvard had to answer quickly — and it did. Junior defenseman Adam Fox wasted no time on the Crimson’s first powerplay opportunity of the night, sending a wrist shot through traffic just 10 seconds into the man advantage. Freshman forward Jack Drury got his stick on the puck and redirected it past Big Green net-minder Adrian Clark to cut the early deficit in half at the 12-minute mark of the opening period.
“In many ways, we were fortunate enough that [the Dartmouth surge] was that early in the game,” Krusko said. “We had a lot of resilience, and our group knew that if we just stuck to our gameplan, maybe turned around, played a little harder, we would have ended up with the result that we did.”
Fox’s first of three helpers on Saturday knotted him with Princeton’s Ryan Kuffner (22–22—44) for most points in the ECAC this season. The Tigers bowed out to Brown last weekend, signifying the completion of their season and Kuffner’s career at Princeton, so the conference scoring title is Fox’s to lose.
Second-period goals from sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh and co-captain Michael Floodstrand propelled Harvard to a 3-2 lead before Foreman tied the game. An active but scoreless third stanza forced the teams to overtime, setting the stage for Krusko’s game- and series-winner.
HARVARD 3, DARTMOUTH 1
Friday’s tilt saw the continuation of multiple regular-season storylines for the Crimson. For starters, a competitive Dartmouth group tripped to Boston with revenge on its mind: last year, in the same round of the ECAC playoffs, the Big Green stole game one before Harvard roared back to claim the series. Both regular-season meetings between the teams were charged with this animosity, and this weekend was no different.
Following a trend that defined much of the campaign, the Crimson rode its high-end talent to victory on Friday. Fox, arguably the most talented offensive blue-liner in college hockey, registered a point on all three Harvard goals (1–2—3). His productive evening marked the first of two three-point efforts this weekend and included the game’s eventual winner.
Just past halfway through the third period, Fox swerved past O’Connor in the neutral zone, entering the offensive third with a two-on-one opportunity. A give-and-go play between Fox and junior forward Colton Kerfoot set up an easy tap-in on a mostly empty net for the defenseman.
Fox moves on from his dominant weekend with a new career high in points (9–37—46), which he set on Friday night. He is now tied with Mark Fusco ’83 for the most points scored by a Harvard defenseman in a single season (13–33—46).
“I’m always reluctant to really go deep into [legacy] while the guy is still here, but I think we’re watching one of the best players that has worn our jersey,” coach Donato said. “[Fox has] been tremendous. He makes others around him better, he’s very underrated defensively, and he never really gets down. He keeps the bench positive and confident, and he’s a heck of a player.”
Another crucial component of Harvard’s success this season has been the timely and plentiful scoring contributions from co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage. The senior paces his team in goals with 18 and sits seventh in the nation in goals per game (0.58). But perhaps more important than the sheer volume of Zerter-Gossage’s tallies is their oft-clutch nature.
The Montréal, Qué, native has found twine when his team has needed it most, providing a shot in the arm to his offense at key turning points of games. November’s win over then-No. 15 Cornell at Madison Square Garden, as well as a more recent February triumph over Brown, are two such instances of Zerter-Gossage’s proclivity for big-time goals.
Friday’s outing proved that this regular-season storyline, just like Fox’s dominance, is here to stay in the postseason. It was Zerter-Gossage who evened the game mid-way through the second frame, sending a puck goalward that ricocheted off the skate of Big Green point man Joey Matthews on its way to the back of the net. Offensively, Harvard carried play from Zerter-Gossage’s goal forward.
“[Zerter-Gossage] was battling some stomach flu tonight,” acknowledged coach Donato after Saturday’s game. “But he was great last night…. He’s been a guy who’s been a go-to guy in the clutch for us.”
Kerfoot sealed the victory, as well as a multi-point game for himself, with his empty-net goal from mid-ice in the waning minutes of Friday’s contest.
Between the pipes for Harvard this weekend was junior Cameron Gornet (5-3-0, 2.43 GAA, .920 SV%), who has done an exceptional job filling in for an injured Michael Lackey after the senior went down with a knee injury in mid-February. Friday night, Gornet (1 GA, .950 SV%) sent away all but one of the 20 shots he faced, ceding Dartmouth’s lone goal to Blankemeier to open the scoring in the middle stanza. On Saturday, the Crimson backstop (3 GA, .923 SV%) made crucial saves to limit the damage the sizzling Big Green inflicted early on.
Lackey continues to make strides in his recovery, first discarding his crutches and brace last week and then participating in goalie training — but not formal practice — in the days leading up to the quarterfinal weekend. Given Gornet’s solid play since Lackey went down (5-2-0, 1.87 GAA, .935 SV%), coach Donato will have a tough decision to make in the crease if and when Lackey is healthy enough to play again.
The Crimson now awaits the conclusion of the conference quarterfinals as it looks ahead to its final-four competition in Lake Placid. The group will battle Clarkson if Cornell completes a series comeback against Union, but if the Dutchmen send the Big Red packing, they will become Harvard’s semifinal foe.
