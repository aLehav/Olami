After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year, roughly 1700 students enter Harvard College. We study fields as diverse as Economics and Organismic Evolutionary Biology. We explore the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences, and some of us pursue unique programs of our own design.
And yet, four years later, more than half of those graduating students who go straight into the workforce will go into one of three industries: consulting, finance, and technology.
According to The Crimson’s annual senior surveys, two-thirds of Harvard’s graduating Class of 2018 entered the workforce directly after graduation. Of those, 18 percent went to work in consulting, 18 percent in finance, and 14 percent in technology. The class of 2017 sent similar shares of students to these three fields.
The draw of these careers is no mystery. Starting salaries in all three fields are among the highest of any industry new grads enter. Yet while so many graduates go to these industries for the money, far fewer plan to stay in these positions for the long term. In its 2018 survey, seniors were asked about their career plans for ten years after graduation, The Crimson found a stark difference between immediate plans and longer-term desires. While 36 percent of working graduates entered consulting and finance in 2018, only 7.5 percent said they wanted to still be in those fields after a decade.
Just under 6 percent of all working students said in 2018 they hoped to be in finance long term. In 2016, 8 percent of all working students said they planned to remain in the technology industry ten years after graduation. Furthermore, in 2017, only 1.7 percent of all working students said they planned to stay in consulting a decade later. In contrast, across all three years, less lucrative or riskier fields like health, arts, government, and entrepreneurship showed the opposite trend: Relatively few graduates actually entered them immediately, but large numbers said they hoped to end up in those fields after a decade.
For some of the students going into the big three industries, their choice is about genuine interest, or a desire to build meaningful experience that will help them in other fields later on. For example, many in the consulting industry go on to law or business school or those at big technology firms choose to later enter the startup world. For others, the higher pay these industries have to offer is the first, last, and only reason for their career choices.
In the absence of broad systemic change, the University could adopt any number of strategies to make other industries similarly accessible. For example, Harvard should do more to encourage the presence of industries like journalism, public service, and the non-profit sector at a level comparable to that of consulting, finance, and tech. While these less lucrative industries cannot compete with the big three in terms of salaries, they should at least be on equal footing with their level of activity in on-campus recruiting.
But all these small-scale changes cannot hope to overcome the major problem that defines this issue. The inescapable truth is that none of these other industries can compete with the big three when it comes to salaries. And while Harvard can and should offer small-scale experimental opportunities, such as better-paying fellowships in these areas, the University must use its platform as an influential institution to push society-wide reform that raises the socioeconomic status of professions like public service, education, and journalism.
I have spoken with multiple students who claim they would go into education, at least for a few years after graduation, if the pay were better. Others have mentioned charities, journalism, and public service as their preferred careers, absent monetary concerns. According to Teach for America, the average annual salary of a teacher starting the program is roughly $45,000. For students who would be interested in teaching, but who can also pursue consulting or finance jobs with more than twice that starting salary and vastly higher growth and bonus potential, the difference is determinative.
Looking at The Crimson’s 2018 survey, the numbers tell the whole story. While more than half of the working students went into the big three industries, only 7.5 percent said they wanted to stay in consulting and finance. Conversely, 18 percent of respondents said they wanted to work in the healthcare industry a decade out from graduation, and 13 percent cited academia.  Harvard should look at those numbers and see in them a call for action. When both societal benefit and personal preference point in one direction, but money demands an alternative course, Harvard — and all of us — should realize the system isn’t working. Money should be a reward for doing what’s good for society and what we’re passionate about, not the biggest thing standing in our way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, news broke that Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. had been retained to represent Harvey Weinstein, who is facing allegations of sexual misconduct.
For those who don’t remember, Weinstein was one of the first prominent figures whose allegations of sexual indecency came to light following extensive reporting by the New York Times and The New Yorker. These allegations against the former Hollywood executive, spanning decades and brought forth by more than 80 women, are serious not just because of the instances themselves but for the underlying issue they represent.
Most of the stories brought to light had been rumored around the industry for years; to many, they were a dirty, “open secret” that came with the power dynamics of the film business.
But sexual harassment is not exclusive to Hollywood. As the #MeToo movement has unfolded, more and more stories have come out showing the extent and impact of sexual harassment — an impact that reaches college campuses like our own. Women in college are three times more likely to experience sexual violence than women of other ages. But these experiences often go unreported because victims fear they won’t be believed.
That’s why it’s crucial for professors, tutors, administrators, and deans to gain students’ trust and for students to know that any adult they go to will treat their experience with the respect it deserves.
By representing Weinstein, Sullivan is effectively choosing to believe the word of one man against the stories of more than 80 women — signaling to his House and to every student at Harvard that he is an ally not to the victims, but to the accused.
That’s a powerful message, especially because rhetoric doubting victims has been a major part of the backlash to the #MeToo movement. Every time an allegation has been made against a prominent figure, it has been received by questions such as “Why did they wait so long to come forward?” and “Where is the proof?”
After this news broke, Sullivan wrote an email to Winthrop affiliates defending his decision and echoing the latter. In his letter, he states that “every citizen charged with a crime is cloaked with the presumption of innocence… People accused of a crime, even very serious crimes, have a constitutional right to zealous representation by counsel.”
This is true. Under the law, there exists a presumption of innocence. But although the law and justice are blind, we cannot be.
As citizens and especially as leaders and mentors, we must avoid playing to a “both sides” narrative and examine the public evidence. Though the law should presume Weinstein innocent, Sullivan is under no obligation to do the same. Yes, Harvey Weinstein, like any other defendant, has the right to retain the best counsel available to him to protect himself against the possible life sentence for which he is being tried. But Sullivan has the right to turn down this client. He should have had the conviction to do so and he should have chosen to stand in solidarity with victims of sexual harassment and abuse.
In his email, Sullivan goes on to underline the need for unpopular defendants to have a robust defense, since peer juries can often revert to “mob justice.” Through those words, he is essentially characterizing the #MeToo movement as “mob justice” and discrediting the courage and effort that it took for so many of those women to tell their stories and their search for justice.
And if, at times, men feel like claims of sexual harassment and abuse abound, they should understand this is not because of false claims or a “mob” mentality. Rather, it’s because these actions are so widespread and commonplace to the female experience that studies have found that more than 80 percent of women surveyed have faced sexual harassment. When these stories are aired and when those who are credibly accused of such actions are shunned socially and prosecuted legally, it is not “mob” justice. It’s justice long awaited.
It is now Sullivan’s job to ensure that Harvey Weinstein receives the lightest possible sentence or is set free, altogether. Like the Kavanaugh confirmation, Weinstein’s acquittal would be one more slap in the face of not only the multitude of women accusing Weinstein directly, but to the millions of other women in the United States who feel like they can’t talk about their own experiences because it will come to no good. It will be a slap in the face to the many women at Harvard who experience sexual harassment and abuse, and to some in his own House.
Sullivan ends his missive asking his House to respect his decision saying that he and his wife “strongly believe that community works best when we respect each other, and, on those occasions when we disagree, we can disagree without being disagreeable.”
There can no disagreement on sexual harassment and assault. This is not an issue with two sides. This is about a man with power who abused that power in order to take advantage of many women over the course of many years. That does not come close to being “agreeable.”
When this case comes to trial, Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. will stand beside Harvey Weinstein, defending him, and inevitably tying Harvard’s name to his defense. That’s not courage and it’s not respect. By standing with Harvey Weinstein, Sullivan is choosing to turn his back on women and undermining his own ability to serve as an advocate and to support his students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The continuing admissions imbroglio has revealed how confused the College is about its purpose in education. On the one hand, it has allegedly been suppressing the admission of Asian-American students so as to make room for more black and Hispanic students, and this for the goals of diversity and social justice. On the other, Harvard seems to admit the children of alumni at five times the rate of other applicants, which counteracts the first policy by preserving the Ivy League upper class and taking spots from the underprivileged. Meanwhile, Students for Fair Admissions insists that both practices be abolished in favor of merit alone.
Houses divided being structurally unsound, we are impelled to decide what Harvard’s purpose is so that we can devise an according admissions regimen. SFFA considers Harvard an essentially academic institution which therefore should train the smartest students it can find, regardless of their race, and dispatch them to illuminate the workforce. Those intent on defending diversity see Harvard not merely as a technical classroom but also as a community of people who learn from each other, not to mention a vehicle to elevate mistreated minorities. Thus the meritocrats accuse the diversitarians of admitting the intellectually unqualified, and the diversitarians rejoin that the meritocrats produce a stultifying uniformity in the class.
Each side is right in part, but both fundamentally mistake Harvard’s mission. Therefore I offer William F. Buckley’s account of the subject, mutatis mutandis, to correct their errors.
The proper admissions policy is as follows: Having set the academic standard for the incoming freshmen as high as it sees fit, Harvard will admit any legacy student whose grades and test scores show him able to graduate in four years, provided he meets the normal non-academic qualifications.
Several objections rush to mind, principally that this policy perpetuates a privileged upper class. It does — that is what it is designed to do. John Adams, Class of 1755, defined gentlemen as those who have received a liberal education; Harvard is a liberal arts college, and its first purpose is to produce graduates who will lead their towns, their states, and their country. Harvard itself avows that it aims to produce the future leaders of America, not merely the future academics. Brilliant scholars are, of course, necessary and desirable, but such minds will always be only a fraction of a Harvard class.
Such graduates are collectively called the ruling class, which is not a phrase one is permitted to use today in America, unless it be with democratic disgust. Yet those who call a ruling class “un-American” are flagrantly ignorant of the history of what they pretend to be defending: the Adamses, Lodges, Eliots, Lowells, Winthrops, Rockefellers, Roosevelts and Kennedys have been indispensable in the health and government — and even founding — of the United States, and they all cultivated in their children a dedication to serve and lead society at its three levels. It is the envious egalitarians who are un-American.
Thus we have an argument for liberal education, but not for Harvard specifically. To arrive there we must address another objection to legacy admissions, namely that alumni donate to the College in exchange for their children’s admission in a corrupt bargain. But why, in the first place, should an alumnus make donations to Harvard? Not because of a general commitment to higher education, for in that case the money would create a much greater marginal benefit for a school way down the rankings. Not to enable Harvard to gather in one place as many brilliant professors as possible; the rules of philanthropy would actually dictate releasing many professors from Harvard so they could bolster inferior schools.
No, the reason for alumni to donate to Harvard is that they want Harvard, and not Yale or Houston Baptist, to remain faithful to the standards and traditions which produce graduates whose education makes them dedicated to benefiting the country. This creates a reciprocal relationship: The alumni are committed to supporting the College, and the College is committed to admitting the alumni’s children, provided they are qualified. The muckrakers call this mercenary; I call it honorable. (It is in fact an extension of the natural bias of the family, about whose eradication the meritocrats have been known to fantasize.)
Without this relationship, without Harvard’s dedication to its own traditions, there is no reason for Harvard to be a private university at all. A private university advances interests beyond mere training in facts, namely imparting a unique character, culture, and societal obligation on its graduates. If Harvard abjures this goal, it should donate itself to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Despite all this, however, the legacy preference does not close off Harvard from everyone but the aristocracy. The laws of romance and fertility prohibit that even half an admitted class should be composed of legacies. The Crimson reported in 1929, under University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1887, in the fullness of his discrimination, that the freshman class of 853 students included 321 sons of alumni, only 38 percent. The majority of students under such a system must still be culled from the great flocks of everyday American high-schoolers.
Contra both meritocrats and diversitarians, Harvard is neither an IQ refinery nor a tool of economic reorganization. The admissions office should never prefer the unqualified to the qualified in the name of alumni relations. Instead, it must always prefer tradition and noblesse oblige to misguided democratic malice.

​​​​​​
Harvard Business School Professor Emeritus Henry “Hank” B. Reiling, a specialist in finance, taxation, and law and an influential educator, died on Jan. 21 in Belmont, Mass., at the age of 80.
Reiling served as a professor of business administration at the Business School from 1978 until he retired in 2005, and continued to hold a professorship until 2012. He died of Alzheimer’s disease, with which he was diagnosed six years ago.
He began teaching at Harvard in 1976, after serving as a professor at Columbia Business School and a visiting professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business. After receiving a B.A. in history at Northwestern University, Reiling earned an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1962, and a J.D. from Columbia in 1965.
His background in law was critical to his work co-designing the Business School class “Leadership and Corporate Accountability,” the first required course at the school that asks its students to examine the ethical dimensions of business practice.
Business School Professor Lynn S. Paine, who worked on the course curriculum with Reiling, wrote in an email that she remembered Reiling’s “deep concern for students and their development as leaders with both competence and character.”
“He mentored many students and faculty over the years,” she wrote. “Because he was so eminently circumspect and fair-minded, he was a sought-after source of guidance and counsel.”
Reiling also taught the popular course “Tax Factors in Business Decisions,” where he was widely admired for making dry material engaging.
“He really taught in a way that led you to think about your life beyond just business school,” former student Samuel M. Mencoff said.
“He stood for the pursuit of truth, for advancing excellence, for living one’s life with honesty, integrity, and dignity, and I would say that knowing Hank and being his student years ago was really one of the greatest gifts.”
Mencoff and another former student, Gregory W. Wendt, decided to honor Reiling in 2011 by establishing The Professor Henry B. Reiling Fellowship Fund to provide financial support to qualifying students.
After Reiling’s father died when he was four, his mother had to work hard to pay for his and his sister’s educations.
“He bootstrapped himself all the way to where he got,” his wife Carol S. Reiling said.
In 2004, Business School graduate Daisy Wademan Dowling authored “Remember Who You Are,” a book containing 15 essays on leadership by Business School professors. She included Reiling’s essay “Building Values,” in which he called for his students to meet “disappointment and hard knocks with resilience, like a sturdy old coffee mug at a roadside diner—drop it, and it just sort of bounces.”
Aside from his teaching, Reiling chaired University committees like the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibilities, as well as professional committees like the task force of the American Bar Association, which influenced how the federal government taxes stock purchase warrants.
Reiling was a prolific writer, publishing articles in The Harvard Business Review, The Journal of Accountancy, Michigan Law Review, and others. In 1982, he co-wrote “Business Law: Text and Cases,” and produced dozens of case studies and course materials for the Business School.
Reiling was active outside of the academic world, coaching his grandson’s elementary school basketball team, keeping time at his daughter’s swim meets, running marathons, biking all over the world, and, as a proud sixth-generation Kentuckian, co-founding the cooking group Kentuckians of Boston.
“He was very much a family-man,” Carol Reiling said.
She said faculty members and staff workers alike attended his funeral service.
“He knew everybody by name, whether they worked in the kitchen or whether they were in class with him. He was just that kind of person,” she said.
Reiling is survived by his wife; by children Christina R. Breiter and her husband Hans C.R. Breiter, Maria H. Reiling and her husband Reza Jamei, and Alexis Reiling Lessans and her husband Gregory P. Lessans; and by nine grandchildren.
A funeral service was held on Saturday at Hancock Church in Lexington, Mass., where Reiling resided. In lieu of flowers, the family requested donations to The Professor Henry B. Reiling Fellowship Fund.

Bryce Dallas Howard, an American actress, producer, and director, is the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2019 Woman of the Year, the organization announced Tuesday.
Howard is best known for her role as Claire Dearing in the Jurassic World trilogy. She starred alongside Chris Pratt in both "Jurassic World" — the highest grossing film of 2015 — and in "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom." The franchise announced that "Jurassic World 3: Extinction," the final installment of the trilogy, will be released in 2021.
In addition to "Jurassic World," Howard has appeared in box-office hits such as "Spider-Man 3" and "The Help." She was most recently cast as Elton John’s mother in "Rocketman," which will debut in theaters on May 31.
Howard’s career has also included television roles in" Arrested Development" and "Black Mirror," for which her performance earned her a 2017 SAG Award nomination for “Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series.” Howard produced the 2011 film "Restless" and is currently co-directing "The Mandalorian," a Disney Star Wars TV series. She also voices Bella the dog in "A Dog’s Way Home," which debuted in theaters on Jan. 11.
As is tradition for Woman of the Year festivities, Hasty Pudding Theatricals will parade through the streets of Harvard Square in Howard’s honor Thursday. At 4 p.m., the actress will be awarded the Pudding Cup in Farkas Hall with a celebratory roast shortly following the presentation.
Afterwards, the Pudding will end the evening with a preview of its 171st production, “France France Revolution.” The show will mark the first time in nearly 200 years that the Hasty Pudding Theatricals has incorporated female students into its formerly all-male cast.
Since the award was first created in 1951, the Pudding has annually bestowed the title of Woman of the Year on female “performers who have made lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment.”
Howard joins the ranks of 67 prominent entertainers who have been past recipients of the award. Previous Women of the Year include Meryl Streep, Halle Berry, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Amy Poehler, Kerry Washington, Octavia Spencer, and Mila Kunis, the 2018 recipient.
“In addition to being fans of Bryce’s work in TV and film, we admire her efforts to forge new pathways for female artists and creatives in Hollywood," Pudding co-producer Mariana C. Sanchez-Medina ’20 said in a press release issued Tuesday.
Speaking to the historic nature of this year’s production, Elizabeth C. Mann ’20, another co-producer, said the Pudding is “thrilled to honor Bryce Dallas Howard as our 68th Woman of the Year and for her to witness the groundbreaking first performance with our wonderful cast, featuring six talented Harvard women.”
The Pudding has yet to announce its 2019 Man of the Year. The roast for the recipient of that honor will be held on Feb. 8.

Students in a freshman seminar taught by Divinity School Professor Catherine A. Brekus ’85 curated an exhibit at the Andover-Harvard Theological Library exploring the intersection of slavery and Christianity.
The exhibit, “The Yoke of Bondage: Christianity and African Slavery in the United States,” stemmed from Brekus’s course Freshman Seminar: "Christianity and Slavery in America, 1619-1865: A Student-Curated Library Exhibit," which was taught during the fall semester. The exhibit will be on display until March 15.
This was the first time the class has worked on curating an exhibit though it was Brekus’s third time teaching the seminar. In past years, she took students to Schlesinger Library to look at archival documents.
Berkus wrote in an email Tuesday that her students appreciated working directly with primary sources.
“They reported that working with rare materials had made the history of slavery feel more immediate and embodied,” she wrote.
The exhibit, displayed on the second floor of the library, showcases abolitionist propaganda, Unitarian sermons, and testimonies of black Christians.
“I’m black and I’m Christian, and for any black Christian you have to understand the foundation of your religion,” M. Seven Richmond ’22, who took the seminar, said. “An oppressor took your ancestors out of their homeland with chains and a Bible.”
Richmond said he was inspired by the writings of escaped slaves such as Frederick Douglass. Testimonies written by black Christians sit at the center of the exhibit, serving as a focal point for the collection.
“I love to see how black people were able to redefine the religion for themselves,” Richmond said.
Brekus coordinated with Nell K. Carlson and Jessica Suarez, two curators of the Theological Library’s historical and special collections, to spend every class session in the library’s archives.
“We coordinated some of the technical parts of the exhibit, which included helping create facsimiles and bringing in a conservator to demonstrate how to handle archival documents," Carson said.
After reading 25 documents selected by Brekus, students worked both individually and in groups to research and curate items for the exhibit. Much of the exhibit is devoted to abolitionist propaganda, though a few pieces show pro-slavery interpretations of the Bible.
“Most students were drawn to antislavery texts,” Brekus wrote. “We especially wanted to highlight the testimonies left by black Christians.”
Richmond, who researched pro-slavery religious arguments as part of the seminar, said he was astonished by how slaveholders used biblical scripture.
In its captions, the exhibit emphasizes that the images abolitionists used to depict the horrors of slavery were often dehumanizing.
Djibril Rushingabigwi ’22 chose to present images from “The Anti-Slavery Record,” a collection of stories disseminated by abolitionists.
“Another picture is of a black man on the ground and a white man hovering over him with a gun,” Rushingabigwi said, referring to a still image from the collection. “It’s something that can be linked today to stories such as police brutality that could potentially be traced back to slavery.”
“There is an intermediary between the Bible and how it is interpreted, and that is the human mind,” Rushingabigwi said.

Faculty members gearing up to teach General Education courses under the revised program this fall say they are excited about the prospect of reaching new students.
Some faculty members are preparing entirely new curricula to fit the requirements, while others are revamping previously offered departmental courses to reach a broader audience.
The changes come as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences prepares to roll out a revamped version of the program — which aims to encourage students to “explore enduring questions,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh wrote in an email Tuesday. A faculty committee tasked with reviewing the program in 2015 found it was “failing on a variety of fronts,” prompting the Faculty to overhaul the requirements.
Last year, administrators announced they were delaying the rollout of the new program until fall 2019 — a year later than originally planned — to give faculty members more time to develop courses.
On Monday, Claybaugh affirmed the program is “absolutely” funded, after initial concerns from some faculty members about a lack of administrative and financial support for the program.
“Gen Ed is more than a requirement: it defines what a Harvard College education should mean,” she wrote. “Recognizing that, the administration has allocated considerable resources to Gen Ed.”
Comparative Literature Professor David Damrosch — who will teach Gen Ed 1021: “The Stories We Tell” in the fall along with English Professor Martin Puchner — praised the focus of the new program, saying it allows faculty members to ground courses in their own expertise but still offer broad lessons for students in all disciplines.
“One of the things that’s been nice about the reinvention of Gen Ed currently is that it’s striking a good balance now between the general and the particular,” Damrosch said. “So that this can be a course based in literature that nonetheless is a general course and not a specialized course.”
“I think in the prior formulation of Gen Ed there was more of a tendency to be almost anti-disciplinary or to be very broadly philosophical, in a way,” he added.
Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences Robert J. Wood, who served on the Gen Ed review committee, plans to teach Gen Ed 1080: “How Music Works: Engineering the Acoustical World” this fall.
“We’re able to touch on concepts all throughout engineering, but you don’t need to have an engineering background to take the course,” he said. “That’s a huge population of the Harvard student body that can walk in off the street and take the course, and yet be challenged.”
Wood said he is excited to engage “a broader audience” in the technical sciences through music.
“As the course previously was, it was kind of limited in terms of who could take it under different concentration requirements,” he said. “I very much want an academically diverse student body.”
Other professors said the Gen Ed changes provided an opportunity to develop an entirely new curriculum. Classics Professor Kathleen M. Coleman, who will teach Gen Ed 1131: “Loss” this fall, said the committee asked her if she would prefer to revamp a course she had taught for multiple years.
“I thought, here’s an opportunity for me to offer something different and, starting from scratch, I can maybe make it into what the new Gen Ed wants instead of trying to squeeze the old one into a new sausage,” she said.
The fate of at least one previously offered course — Culture and Belief 23: “From the Hebrew Bible to Judaism” — remains in limbo, as Professor Shaye J. D. Cohen attempts to “convince" the review committee to reinstate its Gen Ed status.
“I am hoping that after further conversation with the GenEd office I will be able to offer CB 23 again as a Gen Ed course,” he wrote in an email.
Claybaugh wrote in her email that the Gen Ed standing committee will review all courses “both now and periodically going forward.”

From fall 2017 to early this year, the shriek of fire alarms in Harvard’s Holden Green housing complex have become regular background noise to residents’ daily activities from bedtime to birthday parties.
Professors, graduate students, and their families living in the collection of buildings along the Somerville-Cambridge border were already in the midst of a months-long construction debacle — with limited access to residences, constant dust, jackhammering, and water leaks — when the alarms started going off sporadically in Sept. 2017, sometimes multiple times a week.
The sirens rang 48 times before seeming to stop earlier this month, according to Somerville Fire Department records. Every single one was a false alarm.
Responders found supposed causes including malfunction, low battery, “hazardous materials,” gas leaks, and false smoke and heat detectors, but never once saw such conditions. In 11 cases, firefighters could not identify the cause of the alarm. Sometimes, multiple sirens would sound in a single day — on Dec. 28, 2018 four false alarms went off in the same room between 6:13 p.m. and 9:07 p.m. That apartment alone saw 33 of 48 alarms.
Somerville Fire Department Lt. Tim Donovan said firefighters took these calls “very seriously,” with five firefighters and two trucks regularly sent to assess the danger to residents while working to turn the alarm off. After months of recurring alarms, the trucks began to arrive in silence.
​​​​
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that inspectors found hot air vents placed near residents' alarms may have caused some of the false sirens. In early January, Harvard University Housing and a third-party consultant redirected the airflow of the vents in apartments with recurring alarms. Since January 7, there have been no false alarms.
“Harvard University Housing appreciates residents’ continued patience as it works to further ensure that all safety systems and detection devices are functioning properly,” O’ Rourke wrote. “[Harvard University Housing] is confident that while some of the alarms may currently be operating in an overly sensitive manner, they have all been repeatedly tested, remain functional, and have been determined to be fully able to detect any life threatening emergencies.”
Following the months of alarms, Holden Green residents Pedro and Renata Moreira said they consider themselves lucky: They only had one false alarm in their apartment.
“We were recently moved here and I woke up at 3:00 a.m. and saw the fire department and said ‘Oh, my God. We need to leave,’” Pedro Moreira said.
He said his initial fear transformed into a persistent worry that if a real emergency occurred, people might not react.
“There’s always that joke that when you were a kid your mother said, ‘Don’t pretend you’re in an emergency when you are not, because when you really have an emergency people will think that you’re pretending,’” Pedro Moreira said. “I’m always afraid of that.”
For many of Holden Green’s residents, the alarms became part of everyday life. David Brivio, a resident who has six children, said that whenever an alarm went off they saw the firetruck and said, “‘Oh, another time!’”
The Moreiras even threw a firefighter-themed birthday for their son after he befriended the building’s frequent visitors.
“We ran out and bought some firefighter hats for the kids. I made the joke, ‘Well, when the firefighters come we can go there,’” Pedro Moreira said. Sure enough, an alarm went off in the middle of the party and firefighters showed up.
Despite residents’ determination to make the most of the situation, many said they were still frustrated by long months without a solution.
“Harvard knows it is responsible to do something,” Renata Moreira said. “This week they are having an inspection for the units. They do it often. Even after that, it still happens.”
Pedro Moreira said the University first tried to replace all the smoke detectors in 2017 to address the issue, but the problem persisted. He said he was cynical about the University finding a fix to this problem after residents endured months of construction issues in 2017 that resulted in the University paying residents thousands of dollars each.
“During the construction I was already scared how Harvard was not doing things properly. I’d say for me that was a bit surprising,” he said. “Now after two years without being able to solve the problem, I don’t think they know what’s going on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​
Yan Chen admits that, at the age of 23, she’s older than most Rhodes Scholars, but she said she is no less passionate about using the platform to study and advocate for theater.
"It feels like I've lived so much of my life already,” Chen said in an interview Tuesday. “I feel so old.”
Chen, a 2018 graduate of the American Repertory Theater Institute and the Extension School at Harvard, is the first Harvard affiliate to receive the Rhodes Scholarship in mainland China, bringing the total number of University-affiliated winners this year to six. Numerous countries and regions offer individual Rhodes scholarships for their residents.
The Rhodes Scholarship pays for graduate study at Oxford University, and more than 350 Harvard alumni have received the honor since the fellowship's establishment in 1902. The year’s class has more women than ever before, and immigrants or first-generation college students comprise nearly half the class.
After graduating from Nanjing University with a degree in English literature, Chen studied dramaturgy and theater studies at Harvard. While in Cambridge, she became involved in several Boston-area theater productions, as well as shows in Moscow and Shanghai.
Chen, who labels herself a “dramaturge, an aspiring scholar researcher and also a theater critic and translator,” said she wanted to apply for the Rhodes to promote the arts and specifically theater, a craft which she said “cultivates empathy, understanding, and collaboration.”
Chen also said the scholarship’s emphasis on public service encouraged her to apply for the chance to study at Oxford this year.
“I felt the Rhodes offered a perfect opportunity to not just further my research but also to be immersed in a community of individuals who were all very highly motivated, who excelled in their field and who more importantly, wanted to use their talent...not just for their own benefit, but for the benefit of others,” Chen said.
Chen joins five other Harvard affiliate in receiving the prestigious award this year. Jin K. Park ’18 -’19, the first DACA recipient of the scholarship in United States history, and Brittany N. Ellis ’19, a former Crimson news executive, won the Rhodes scholarship in the American districts.
The Rhodes Trust also named Michael Liu ’19, Olga Romanova ’19, and T. Mattea Mrkusic ’17 Harvard College’s three international Rhodes scholars. This year, the Rhodes Trust launched two new Global Rhodes Scholarships for candidates from anywhere in the world. Romanova is among the inaugural winners of the Global Rhodes. Liu, who is from Canada, and Mrkusic, who is from New Zealand, won scholarships from their home regions.
Chen said she is encouraged by the establishment of the Global Rhodes Scholarship and hopes it can lead to more international scholars.
“I'm really hoping that more people like me who are studying away from their home country can learn about this opportunity,” Chen said.
While at Oxford, Chen said she plans to pursue research into theater as well as bring a “trans-cultural” approach to professional theater scenes.
“I've studied theater in five countries so far, and I'm just hoping that there would be opportunities to bring people together to forge new relationships and new collaborations to work on new productions and new exciting projects,” Chen said.
As for life after Oxford, Chen said she hopes to work in international theater to promote the work of artists from across the globe.
“I might like to run an international theater project someday to help artists from all around the world and especially in China, my home country, of course, to develop their new original work,” Chen said.

From his lab in Harvard’s Geological Museum, Rus Gant can send people to Mars, Paris, the Pyramids of Giza, the bottom of the ocean, or on a flying tour of Manhattan with the press of a few buttons.
As one of the leading experts on virtual reality technology, Gant has spent decades developing ways to bring the whole world into the classroom. He joined Harvard’s Visualization Laboratory in 2010, following stints at the MIT and Carnegie Mellon.
“He’s one of the real pioneers in the entire field,” said Christopher J. Dede, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education whose research focuses on the educational uses of virtual and augmented reality.
Gant’s recent projects include turning French language-learners into Parisians for a class period; taking college students on a virtual field trip to see the Sphinx and pyramids in Egypt; and giving geology students the power to build mountains in a sandbox.
Paul Kelley, the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences laboratory director, has worked with Gant since he first brought his ideas to the department’s Visualization Lab.
“What really strikes me about Rus is not only the degree of passion that he brings to this and the strength of his belief in the role that it has to do with education, but his sustained ability to stay current in what the developments are,” Kelley said.
Gant built his first virtual reality headset in 1979 — a decade after then-Harvard professor Ivan E. Sutherland built his “Sword of Damocles,” often considered the first virtual reality headset. Since then, Gant has worked to develop new technologies, softwares, and teaching methods to bring virtual reality into classrooms around the world.
IMMERSIVE LEARNING AS A "SUPERPOWER"
“Today we’re talking about Mongolia. Boom! We’re in Mongolia,” Gant said, standing in his lab. “It’s like a superpower.”
Gant said he believes one of the most promising uses of virtual reality is immersion — embedding people in another environment through an entirely digital world.
He has worked on many projects at Harvard to make this a reality.
Following the 2015 Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in Paris, Gant collaborated with French Professor Nicole Mills to bring her students to memorial services in France via the Visualization Lab.
“A student was experiencing a memorial where people were singing and clapping, and the student actually started to clap while in the headset as if she was there,” Mills said. “There’s a really powerful experience of visiting that moment in time.”
Gant and Mills have continued exploring applications of virtual reality in language instruction. Over spring break 2017, he gave her a virtual reality camera to capture footage while taking a trip to Paris. Gant, who has a B.F.A. and M.F.A in 3D Cinematography and Animation and 3D Photography, then edited the footage into a series of vignettes, which Mills’ students used to experience different quarters of Paris through virtual reality headsets mounted to smartphones.
Inspired by the two earlier successes, Mills, with the help of Gant and Dede, applied for and received a grant in 2017 for a Paris virtual reality narrative project. Mills worked with virtual reality company Wonda to film four Parisians living in the city over the course of two months and used the footage to produce virtual reality experiences.
Now students in one of Mills’s classes, French 11: “French II: Exploring Parisian Life and Identity,” spend three days with virtual reality headsets, each day dedicated to the life of a different Parisian — an 11-year-old boy, a Tunisian filmmaker, and an artist-magician. Mills said she believes virtually experiencing Paris through others’ eyes changed her students’ perception of what it means to be Parisian.
“They spoke a lot more about the practices of Parisians, and how people live and how people behave,” she said.
One of Gant’s earliest projects at Harvard was the Giza Project, led by Anthropology Professor Peter Der Manuelian ’81. The project, still in progress, seeks to create detailed digital models of the Giza Plateau, home to the Giza Pyramids, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
“I enjoy picking his brain for future technology developments, and linking new developments with applications to education and archaeology that have not been previously brought together,” Der Manuelian wrote in an email.
Gant recently pushed the boundaries of archaeological education by virtually bringing students from China’s Zhejiang University to the Giza Plateau along with one of Der Manuelian’s Egyptology classes.
Gant led students on an exploration of the tombs with the lab’s Rumii technology set-up, while Der Manuelian simultaneously lectured to classes thousands of miles apart.
“Literally at the same moment, at the same time, students on the other side of the world are engaged in exactly the same class material in this kind of virtual classroom,” Kelley, the lab director, said. “That’s unprecedented.”
ON THE CUTTING EDGE
Real-time collaboration in virtual reality, like in Der Manuelian’s class, was made possible by recent improvements in technology and decreasing costs. The Visualization Lab’s hardware has undergone several upgrades in recent years.
A screen in the lab can show multilayered images with such high resolution that humans standing miles away in photographs can be seen clearly when zoomed in.
The lab features two high speed 10-gigabit Internet connections, multiple types of virtual and augmented reality headsets, 7.2 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, and seating for 25 students. The servers in an adjacent closet run at least three game engines simultaneously and support three operating systems.
“The room itself is a kind of instrument,” Gant said. “You can see any content in that instrument.”
For some classes, the lab may feature a trip to the Canadian Rocky Mountains with a 360-degree video of a field lecture to supplement.
For others, it can bring students through the lens of a microscope. In one biology class, students used to have to watch a professor examine a specimen through a window or small monitor because the microscope was too sensitive to have multiple people present.
With the Visualization Lab, students can observe the data collection in high definition.
These solutions seem to be an answer to one of Gant’s guiding questions: “How can we bring students closer to the data, closer to the labs, closer to the research?”
The sandbox in Gant’s office represents another answer. Equipped with an Xbox camera, a projector, and a mid-range graphics computer, the box is a real-time topographical map generator. Incoming geology students can move the sand and a new map will project onto the surface. Holding out a flat hand creates digital rain, which pools at the lowest point of the projection.
VIRTUAL REALITY FOR ALL
“It’s relatively easy to tell the future. It’s hard to tell the timing of the future,” Gant said. “My role has been to be 10 years ahead of everybody else.”
His office is lined with decades of iterations of virtual reality hardware. Though virtual reality is not new, cost has long posed a significant barrier to its widespread use. In the 1980s, Gant said, a single headset cost upward of $10,000.
Only in the past ten years, with the release of gaming headsets like Hasbro MY3D and the mass production of smartphone parts, has the technology become affordable, he said. A formerly $7,000 accelerometer now costs 35 cents to manufacture, and Gant is even considering designing Harvard-specific headsets since parts’ costs aren’t astronomical.
This is not to say the most complex virtual reality will soon be accessible across the University, though. Scaling the technology requires making the Visualization Lab and headsets work consistently, an ongoing challenge.
“It’s one thing to do a one-off demo,” Gant said. “The technology needs to run on Harvard time.”
Another obstacle is the rapidly evolving nature of the virtual reality field: “If we buy it in the spring semester, will it be obsolete by fall?” Gant asked.
Regardless, Gant said he believes the increasing affordability of many virtual reality headsets can open up enormous possibilities for the classroom. He has done dozens of collaborations since coming to Harvard, ranging from Harvard Divinity School classes to the Business School.
“What VR headsets do is essentially what this screen does for one person,” Gant said, gesturing to the Visualization Lab’s screen. “A $200 headset” — referring to the Oculus Go, of which the Visualization Lab has 25 — “can replace a $200,000 room.”
Libraries, as well, have the potential to democratize virtual reality technology. Gant has worked with Susan Berstler, a technology specialist at the Cabot Science Library, to start making the technology accessible to all Harvard students.
The two have converted a group study room on the library’s second floor into a virtual reality space in which students can use a headset while a monitor mounted outside the room displays to onlookers what the current user is seeing.
“There’s no reason why we couldn’t check out VR headsets that have content on them related to a class the same way we check out books for research,” Berstler said.
“He is a resource for the greater Harvard campus,” Berstler added. “It’s sometimes very hard to work across departments and schools at Harvard, people get very siloed, and he doesn’t see any of those siloes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
The Undergraduate Council voted to publish a comment against United States Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos’s proposed changes to federal Title IX rules at an emergency meeting Tuesday evening.
Running up against a Jan. 30 deadline for the 60-day public comment period on the new changes, the UC voted to oppose Devos’s rules, 24-1-1. The government’s comment-collecting website indicates that comments must be received by Jan. 28, despite the later closing date.
The UC’s resolution criticized the proposed rules’ altered approach to enforcing Title IX, the federal anti-discrimination law that underlies Harvard’s sexual misconduct policies. In particular, representatives argued against the proposals’ redefining of supportive measures, elimination of mandatory 60-day investigatory periods, and the optional elevation of evidentiary standards in investigation proceedings.
Under the proposed rules, supportive measures — meant to accommodate victims who report their abusers — must be implemented “without unreasonably burdening the other party.”
“Redefining supportive measures will disincentivize students from reporting sexual harassment or assault, and may actually exacerbate the impact of trauma on survivors’ academic life, instead of providing meaningful support to those students who need it,” the UC’s comment reads.
The council also disagreed with the move from a mandatory 60-day investigatory period to a “reasonably prompt” timeframe, arguing that this could cause cases to drag on for months or years, potentially past the graduation of involved parties. The UC claimed that even with the 60-day rule in place, Harvard has “failed to even come close” to meeting this requirement, per statistics published in Harvard’s annual Title IX report produced jointly by the Title IX Office and Office for Dispute Resolution, which conducts official Title IX investigations.
“This change would only serve to hinder students’ education and further tax survivors,” the comment said.
The UC criticized the proposed rules’ shift from requiring a “preponderance of the evidence” standard to allowing schools to choose the more stringent “clear and convincing evidence” standard. They wrote that such standards would favor the testimony of respondents rather than complainants.
“Placing the burden of proof on the survivor will also work to disincentivize reporting and increase the risk that serial harassers or abusers will continue to create a hostile campus environment,” they argued in the comment.
Harvard officially published its comments on the rule changes through the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts and the Association of American University, who both submitted their statements last week.
“We are partaking in the same notice-and-comment process because we believe that the rules and regulations as they currently stand would really endanger the safety of all students, and especially survivors on this campus and their access to education,” UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 said of the UC’s decision to file its own comment.
The AICUM’s comments in particular focused heavily on opposing the proposed rules’ new cross-examination requirement in investigation proceedings, arguing that the change may deter individuals from coming forward with complaints. The UC did not reference this aspect of the proposal in their comments.
Huesa said live cross-examinations “can be extremely traumatizing" in an interview after the vote,
Many representatives said they are proud that the UC passed the resolution.
“Especially as a survivor of sexual assault, it really does show a commitment to the well-being and inclusion and safety of the students on campus,” representative Maxwell A. Gillmer ’21 said.
“I was really surprised that so many people showed up,” representative Jenny Y. Gan ’22 added. “That was really inspiring to me, that everyone came together for something that they knew was important and that they really cared about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 1
Pennsylvania at Cornell, 5:00 PM.
Despite losing standout Ryan Betley to a season-ending injury, the Quakers have looked every bit the part of Ivy League defending champs this season. Penn secured the Big 5 title by going undefeated against Philadelphia rivals Villanova, St. Joe’s, La Salle, and Temple, but dropped both games to Princeton to get the Ivy League season started. Expect the Quakers to come out firing against a mediocre Cornell team that split the Empire State series with Columbia.
The Pick: Penn by 8 or more.
Brown at Dartmouth, 7:00pm.
The Bears had a tough start to the season, opening up with two games against travel partner Yale. After dropping both contests, expect Brown to come out hungry Friday night against the Big Green, as the Bears’ chances at qualifying for the tournament dwindle significantly if they can’t pull out at least one win against Dartmouth and Harvard. Nevertheless, expect a Big Green team that has somewhat surprised after being picked last in the preseason poll, to protect the home court that spurred them to an 18-point win over Harvard.
The Pick: Dartmouth by 3 or more.
Princeton at Columbia, 7:00pm.
This is a tough game to pick. After a late-night incident at a Princeton Wawa, the Tigers have been without their best player, senior guard Devin Cannady, who has been suspended indefinitely following his arrest. Nevertheless, the Tigers have jumped out to a 2-0 start with wins over Penn before Cannady’s suspension, putting Princeton in strong position to cling to an Ivy League Tournament spot. Columbia hasn’t impressed thus far against Cornell and non-conference opposition, and stands at 1-1 in Ivy Play. I like Mitch Henderson’s team to come out prepared for the New York trip, knowing that weekends against stiffer opposition in the form of Harvard, Yale, and Brown all loom in the coming weeks.
The Pick: Princeton by 4 or more.
Yale at Harvard, 7:00pm.
It feels a bit ill-fitting that Harvard-Yale is being played on the first weekend of Ivy League action - nevertheless, Lavietes will surely be packed to the brim for Friday night’s nationally televised contest on ESPNU. The Bulldogs have looked good in two close wins over Brown, and have won eight straight games dating back to a December 8th loss at Duke. This contest should be a good measuring bar for two of the Ivy League’s blue bloods, and league favorites alongside Penn. Ultimately, the Bulldogs are a bit healthier, with the Crimson still missing Seth Towns. I would expect Harvard to be favored here, but it’s hard to pick against a Yale team that’s been pretty impressive behind Miye Oni.
The Pick: Yale by 2 or more.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 2
Brown at Harvard, 7:00pm.
After taking on Dartmouth, the Bears will travel to Lavietes Pavilion to play Harvard. The Crimson must be sure to not overlook Brown and expend too much energy Friday night against Yale - expect a hard fought defensive contest between Harvard’s stifling defense and the Brown’s young team, which leads the Ivy League in defense (68.2 ppg) and average scoring margin (+8.7). That being said, expect the Crimson to focus in on locking down the Bears’ star Desmond Cambridge, and take down the visitors from Rhode Island.
The Pick: Harvard by 3 or more.
Yale at Dartmouth, 7:00pm.
Saturday night will usher in a matchup between two leaders in field goal percentage - while the Bulldogs lead the Ancient Eight in overall FG shooting (49.4%), the Big Green lead the league from beyond the arc, where they shoot it at over a 40% clip. Brendan Barry is the country’s only 3-point shooter at over 50% (51.4%), but expect a disciplined James Jones-coached Yale team to defend the 3-point line and knock off the Big Green.
The Pick: Yale by 5 or more.
Princeton at Cornell, 7:30pm.
In the absence of Devin Cannady, the Tigers may be hard-pressed to score the ball. Princeton ranks last in the league in 3-point shooting, and sixth in the league in overall scoring - which includes the senior guard’s output. Look for a close game in Ithaca, but Matt Morgan and Cornell might have enough to eek out a win following a tough Friday night contest with Penn. Expect the 9:00pm finish on Friday night in New York City, followed by a 4+ hour bus ride up to Ithaca to be an additional factor for the traveling Tigers.
The Pick: Cornell by 3 or more.
Pennsylvania at Columbia, 8:00pm.
The Lions will welcome the Quakers to town to wrap up the weekend’s Ivy League action with an 8:00pm tip-off in Morningside Heights. Penn has won three of its last four matchups with Columbia, and desperately need to come away from the Cornell-Columbia trip with one, if not two wins, following its two early losses to Princeton. Expect Steve Donahue and his team to zero in on the Lions’ perimeter-oriented offense, especially with Columbia’s Mike Smith lost for the season with a knee injury. Penn’s AJ Brodeur is having himself another fantastic season, averaging over 15 points, 8 rebounds, and shooting over 50% from the field. Expect Brodeur to establish himself against a younger Columbia front-line.
The Pick: Penn by 5 or more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard men’s and women’s tennis teams kick off the latter half of their respective seasons, here is a brief recap of their seasons to date.
Women’s
The fall brought in plenty of new changes for the Harvard women’s tennis team. Starting in the coaching ranks,  the Crimson hired assistant coach Mason Astley, who previously coached at MIT. The roster also featured four fresh faces — freshmen Annika Bassey, Rachel Eason, Rachel Lim, and Chelsea Williams.
Some things stayed the same, though, including the Crimson’s Ivy League dominance.  After finishing 6-1 in conference play last year, Harvard opened the 2018-19 season with a string of strong tournament performances and a 4-0 record in head-to-head play.
“Our team got off to a strong start at [Dartmouth] and [the] Columbia [Invite], where a lot of our younger players got victories,” freshman Rachel Lim said.
The Crimson then rounded out September with wins against Cornell, Boston College, and Dartmouth at the Bulldog Invite in New Haven.
October brought more success for Harvard, starting with senior captain Erica Oosterhout’s run to the final round of the ITA All-American qualifier, scoring a 7-6, 6-2 upset against Stanford’s Caroline Lampl before being eliminated on a close 5-7, 6-7 in the final round against Texas’ Petra Granic.
Oosterhout then paired up with Lim in November to earn doubles victories against Syracuse and Boston University at the Harvard Invitational to finish up the fall season.
Other notable performers throughout the season included sophomore Neha Gupta, who went undefeated at the Bulldog Invitational, and the squad of freshmen, who combined to win seven of eight matches at the Harvard Fall Scramble.
What was the key to all the success? Practice, according to Lim.
“All of us improved many aspects of our game,” said Lim.  “Our coaches made sure to streamline our practices and work on everything from conditioning to strategy. We all focused in practice and made steady improvements throughout the year, and that showed in our tournament performances.”
Men’s
The men’s team, too, saw some changes in leadership at the beginning of the season with the promotion of Andrew Rueb ‘95 to head coach. Rueb follows in the footsteps of coach Dave Fish, who spent 42 years heading the Crimson, amassing 21 titles over that period.  Rueb had considerable success of his own at Harvard, winning Ivy League Player of the Year twice before captaining the Crimson in his senior year. Before his head coaching gig, Rueb served as an assistant coach for the program for 11 years.
Rueb’s impact was immediately felt by the team, who started out strong in the Chowder Fest tournament, where senior captain Andy Zhou opened as his flight’s champion, going 3-0 on the weekend.
Harvard headed down to Princeton and Yale the next weekend for the Ivy Plus tournament, where freshman Steven Sun went undefeated in singles and paired with senior Michael Peters to go undefeated in doubles as well.  Sophomore Lane Leschly also swept through the tournament without any losses, continuing the strong start for the Crimson on the year.
“We had a lot of good results of the bat,” freshman Harry Walker said. “[The freshmen] quickly became adjusted to being the seventh man on the court, which meant we had to focus on helping out teammates as well.”
As the season progressed, Harvard continued to benefit from strong individual performances, notably at Dartmouth’s Big Green Invite. Walker paired with Peters to sweep doubles play, and both players also managed to finish undefeated in singles play and winning the tournament in their respective divisions.
Harvard completed its fall at Wake Forest, where Walker and Peters finished top in their doubles bracket and Sun ended up in fourth place in singles.
“We were all exposed to some really good matches in the fall,” Walker said.  “It was great to face some tough competition.”

Last year, the Harvard men’s hockey team and crosstown foe Boston College skated in a game that no team ever wants to play.
The 66th installment of the Beanpot Tournament, Boston’s annual clash featuring Boston University and Northeastern alongside the Crimson and the Eagles, proved unfruitful for both squads. Losses in the semifinal round sent the Terriers and the Huskies to the championship, while Harvard and Boston College competed for third place in a mostly empty TD Garden.
“In my first two years, I got to see what the consolation game and what the final round is like,” said Crimson co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage. “I learned pretty early how different of a stage [the consolation] is. Especially last year, the fashion that we ended up getting knocked out in the first round in double-OT was pretty difficult to handle.”
While the Crimson emerged victorious in overtime, the consolation game ironically provided very little consolation for coach Ted Donato ’91 and his group, who had hoped to defend their 2017 Beanpot title — the Harvard program’s first in 24 years.
BC, on the other hand, endured its second consecutive fourth-place finish in the February sporting tradition after winning the tournament in six of the previous seven seasons.
On Monday evening, the No. 19 Crimson (10-6-3, 7-5-2 ECAC) and the Eagles (8-12-3, 8-4-3 Hockey East) will meet in the Beanpot semifinal, both looking to avoid a trip back to the “early game” on the second Monday of the tournament. One team will continue its recent Beanpot disappointment, while the other will earn a chance to compete in the finals for Beantown’s long sought after hockey prize.
“For me, personally, growing up…there was one team as far as hockey that you watched, and that was the Boston Bruins,” recalled coach Donato, a lifelong member of the Boston hockey community. “The one college hockey event every year that you would hear about or watch on TV was the Beanpot…. When you had your games in your neighborhood with your brothers, with your friends, you kind of divvied up teams between the Beanpot teams.”
For now, both teams’ sights are set on conference opponents — Harvard hosts Dartmouth and BC visits Connecticut on the Friday leading up to the Beanpot. But each participating school knows that the tournament, originated in 1952, carries a special gravity that can propel its victors to success down the stretch of the regular season and throughout postseason play.
“The teams involved [in the Beanpot] are all so good, and have all been so successful, that the Beanpot can definitely be used as a springboard to take on the challenges that come at the end of the season,” coach Donato said. “When you play teams outside your league that are amongst the top teams, it gives a certain confidence that is helpful to having success.”
The Crimson and the Eagles will carry recent stretches of play with them into the semifinal. After mixed results to kick off the 2019 portion of its schedule, Harvard has nabbed a victory in four of its last five games and, with a triumph over the Big Green, will bring a four-game win streak into TD Garden on Monday.
The successful stint includes wins against top-10 foes Quinnipiac and Clarkson and has seen Harvard pocket eight of 10 possible points in the conference standings.
“Recently, we’ve seen a lot of things kind of coming together,” said Crimson freshman Casey Dornbach. “We hopefully can ride that momentum into the Beanpot, and maybe even use that to be even better the rest of the way.”
The most overt evolution of coach Donato’s squad — and the one that most explains the recent surge — is a renewed commitment to team defense. The Crimson struggled to limit goals against in the early part of the season, conceding an average of 5.33 goals per game through its first three contests, ranking dead last in Division I.
Since a disappointing draw against then-ranked Princeton in early November, however, Harvard is tied for sixth in the nation in goals against per game (2.00).
These defensive improvements have translated into winning results, as the Crimson sits top-10 in the country in goal margin per game (+1.06) and win percentage (.688) during the aforementioned span.
Moreover, the team’s progress made in the defensive zone has polished the numbers of starting goaltender Michael Lackey (10-5-3, 2.20 GAA, .924 SV%). The senior has firmly cemented his role as Harvard’s number-one backstop after the team’s first few outings called it into question.
In his 16 starts since the 4-4 affair with the Tigers, Lackey has held the opposition to two goals or fewer in all but four appearances. He has posted a 10-4-2 record, riding an impressive 1.79 goals against average and .939 save percentage — good for top-10 and top-5 in the NCAA, respectively.
“It’s obvious that our defense has matured, and they do an impeccable job of getting sticks on pucks, letting me see pucks,” Lackey lauded. “It’s been really fun to watch the corps of d-men continue to get better throughout the year.”
BC, the home team in Monday’s tilt after winning the deciding coin flip, is ranked in the bottom 10 in goals per game (2.30) ahead of its matchup with UConn. Coach Jerry York’s squad will therefore have its hands full trying to solve the revamped Crimson defense and net-minder. Scoring struggles have contributed to the Eagles’ uncharacteristic sub-.500 record.
Entering Friday’s game against the Huskies, BC has earned just one win in its last five contests (1-3-1) and two wins in its past nine (2-6-1). Seven of those nine matchups, though, were against teams currently ranked in the USCHO top 20. So the Eagles are well-versed in competitive adversaries.
In the Beanpot semifinal, the Eagles hope to put an end to one of college hockey’s more startling streaks: they have failed to beat a nonconference opponent in the regular season in 25 attempts (0-21-4) dating back to Nov. 13, 2016. In order to do so, the Chestnut Hill dwellers will need to contain a potent Harvard attack.
The Crimson scores the 10th-most goals per game in Division I (3.26) due to speed up front and abundant offensive firepower on its blue line. Harvard’s primary facilitator is junior defenseman Adam Fox (7–20—27), whose 1.05 assists per game and 1.42 points per game place him in the top three nationwide. Fox is also top-three in powerplay assists (0.58) and points (0.79).
Zerter-Gossage (10–4—14) paces the Crimson in goals, although coach Donato benefits from many offensive contributors, many of whom are underclassmen. Sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh (7–11—18) and rookie forwards Jack Drury (6–11—17) and Dornbach (4–18—22) help fuel the team offensively.
These young guns do not anticipate being fazed by the magnitude of the Beanpot, nor should they. In a November matchup with Cornell at Madison Square Garden — arguably the grandest stage in American sports — underclassmen were responsible for seven of the team’s 12 points logged in the 4-1 victory.
“We’ve all played in different big games throughout our careers,” said Dornbach, who notably pocketed three assists at the Garden. “Definitely at this stage of the year — freshman, sophomore, whatever — I think we’re just going to try to contribute as much as possible.”
These Harvard icemen, who are valuable pieces on the nation’s most effective powerplay (35.9%), will present problems for the Eagles’ junior goaltender Joseph Woll (7-11-3, 2.28 GAA, .922 SV%).
In the face of his team’s woes, Woll has still played well this season, posting the best individual numbers of his career. The backstop will look to forwards like David Cotton (15–9—24) and Julius Mattila (7–9—16) to continue to lead by example, and to highly touted attackers such as former Harvard commit Oliver Wahlstrom (6–4—10) to increase their production, in order to muster more goal support from the skaters in front of him.
Despite the many factors that will contribute to the outcome of Monday’s Beanpot semifinal, a Boston school’s fate in the storied tournament often comes down to a single play. The Crimson’s pair of sudden-death deciders in the 2018 Beanpot — first a double-overtime loss to BU and then a third place clincher over the Eagles — proved that much. And while No. 12 Northeastern, fresh off its first Beanpot title since 1988, will enter as the slight favorite, any of the four teams can seize local on-ice supremacy with a tournament win.
“I don’t think that if any one of these teams either won the Beanpot or won their league — or became a real successful team in the NCAAs — I don’t think there would be that many people surprised,” coach Donato said. “You might be more surprised to say that some of these teams have struggled in relation to their own level of success they’ve created over the last few years.”
For some players, this year marks the final time they will descend upon TD Garden on the first two Mondays of February; for others, the 2019 Beanpot is their first glimpse of the ritualistic spectacle that captivates Boston at this time of year. Either way, the stakes are high and promise to deliver ample drama in this year’s local hockey classic.

As one of the newest coffee shop additions to Harvard Square, Blue Bottle Coffee hasn’t solidified itself as a major hot spot on campus. Yet. From my observations, the trendy coffee joint is a meeting place for elitist hipsters and disgruntled students alike, serving as the perfect place to take aesthetic Instagram pictures. I settled down with a notebook, old-fashioned style, to record.
“Does this almond milk taste sweet to you?” “No yeah it’s definitely sweet.”
As a vegan myself, the quality of almond milk is essential in determining whether a coffee shop is going to earn a place on my regular list. Is it on the menu? Plus one point. Homemade? Plus another point. Are there other non-dairy options in case I want to spice it up? Plus another… you get the idea.
“You can’t cry in this place, it’s too nice.”
An ultimate mood. Something about the white minimalistic walls, blue and beige decor, and delicate plant arrangements creates an environment that demands cheeriness. Plus, compared to the dining halls’ coffee-that’s-about-as-effective-as-water, Blue Bottle’s is so robust it’ll dry your tears right up.
“Zac Brown Band is the one country artist I tolerate.”
With a serious dislike of country music myself, I’m not sure if I agree with this one, but I have to hand it to him. Feels a little weird calling an entire band a single artist, though.
“No more hamsters!”
What is the context of this conversation? What does this even mean? I’m so confused.
“She thinks she’s, like, really mature. But she’s not!”
Boy, oh boy, was this conversation a wild ride. Two girls were engaging in a heated discussion as they took turns insulting their blockmate, taking sips of their matching lattes in between hard hits. Poor girl.
*Girl photographing her avocado toast* “It’s like they purposefully made it ugly.”
I admit I actually laughed out loud at this one. It’s smashed avocado on multigrain bread, honey. It’s not that deep.
Were these findings life-changing? Only if you really have nothing better to care about than the woes of elitist students trying to buy being cool. The conversations inside Blue Bottle are just the same as those everywhere else on Harvard’s campus, except everyone is armed with a $6 iced coffee.
