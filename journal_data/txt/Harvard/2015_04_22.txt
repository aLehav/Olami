After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking somewhat angrily at a 2008 conference, radical historian Hayden White said this: "...the best way of finding out what the community…thinks is rational and irrational is [to] go and look at whom they designate as irrational and what they do to them.”
Who, then, is the excluded minority whose thoughts academe currently makes it impossible to think? There are many candidates: the poor majority; racial minorities; religious groups; even the rich minority. The group I’d like to single out is conservatives—not necessarily Republicans or bible-thumpers, but those who follow the politics of Edmund Burke or who adhere to the classical liberal conception of state power. Their power lies largely outside academe—in think tanks, research institutes, corporate sponsors, and so on.
One study looking at 10 years of books published by Harvard University Press labelled 39 percent as leftist, one percent as conservative, and 9 percent as classically liberal or tending that way. (In HUP’s favor, they published a book in 2013 on precisely this topic. It found that a deselection process attracts conservatives to jobs outside of academe.) Other findings indicate that hiring committees are substantially less accepting of colleagues that have connections to the NRA or to the evangelical movement.
All of these findings have been challenged. There have been findings of no substantial bias against conservatives in academe, even in studies done by conservatives. But, in the social sciences where one’s ideas and beliefs become a part of one’s teaching, the easy pathways of liberal scholarship and the demotion and deselection of anything less popular and saleable feels very real, especially in job markets where one article, even one answer to a search committee, may make the difference between advancement and stagnation.
During graduate school, and afterwards, I received very significant funding from external funding groups to pay for tuition, to support postdoctoral positions, and to attend expensive research institutes. I experienced no pressure to change my views at any times from outside funders/donors. But, sheepishly, I admit that I engaged in self-censorship in order to be more attractive to the ideal of conservatism that I imputed to them.
Graduate school is a funny time of experimentation. Specialization often works centrifugally, pushing you towards an unpopulated periphery, and professionalization works centripetally, drawing you towards what seems to work. Conforming to an imagined ideal is, in its worst form, rent-seeking, and in its middling form, unintelligent. You can decide for yourself by reading the reports and newsletters of the Jack Miller Center, for instance, what these groups want. In my view, what the conservative or classical liberal counter-academy wants is to have star scholars within their network, not scholars who handcuff themselves through boilerplate or hypocrisy, and what budding scholars want is to be recognized for their work.
The big sort that allows conservatives and liberals to engage in “way-of-life segregation,” on the basis of their political identities, may be the bigger problem, but it is a difficult one to address. To be one of the minority liberals in the Midwest or the South, to leave for Harvard College and its majority-liberal student body, and then to stay in the Northeast after graduation may liberate the individual student, but it fails to achieve the desired diversity, either within Harvard or in broader society.
The academic ostracism of conservatives and the big sort raise a few interesting questions. First, the claim for representation made by, or more likely on behalf of heartland America, is worth entertaining. Can a school devoted to excellence, such as Harvard, represent the populist values of Middle America—family first, traditions accepted, ambitions scaled to circumstances? If so, who benefits? The second question concerns whether pains should be taken to include conservative scholars in the academic conversation.
At their best, conservatives offer a reflective antidote to presentism and abstraction, a long time-scale, a respect for the Anglo-American tradition, and a refusal to accept only oxymoronically “typical” liberal issues as grist for protest. Their commitments may actually deepen social democrats’ commitments to equality, welfare, and social justice.
Let the right ones in and let them publish on their figures in the history of thought. Let them expand your moral imagination. Yes, even rig the academic market to generate diversity within schools such as Harvard. Both liberals and conservatives need each other to be themselves—scholarly and mentally independent—and neither group should hope to win the culture wars.
The winner’s freedom has always been diminished by winning. Ideological parity and contestation, not domination, is what is needed to achieve academic freedom. If it takes noblesse oblige on behalf of liberal hiring committees, so be it. Even liberty needs a bit of planning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If I was pressed, as I sometimes am, to single out the most valuable lesson I have learned in my time at Harvard it would have to be this: Harvard has taught me to distinguish between drinkable waters and toxic ones.
By this I mean something very simple—that there are many sources of information in this world, and that choosing which ones to trust is one of the most important decisions a person can make. In ours, the heralded age of information, where content is so plentiful, it can be tempting to try to gulp down a waterfall, when instead one ought to prioritize finding a suitable filter.
I have several friends who are conspiracy theorists. People who will sit and explain to me that it is almost impossible that 9/11 was anything but an inside job. They will explain the inner workings of the Illuminati and how money itself is a fictional construct intended solely to empower an invisible elite. They tend to believe in the moon landings—they are not that crazy.
I also have friends who have sat me down and explained to me in rhetoric disguised as argument why a global Islamic Shariah state is inevitable. They claim, with the utmost sincerity, that the word of God is true and that God has commanded that there shall be a global Shariah governed state—Q.E.D. There are glaring holes in these arguments, but holes are easy to look through if you have the correct vantage point.
It is easy to dismiss these people as minorities (which they are) and as being crazy (which they are not). To call someone crazy is to dismiss them, and to claim that they are beyond reasonable understanding and discourse. We should not dismiss these people.
Furthermore, we cannot hope to understand such people if we assume they trust the same sources of information that we do, and if we judge them by the resultant moral standards.
To make the point more forcibly, consider the following thought experiment. You find yourself in a fierce debate with an interlocutor who has taken some unforgivably heinous position—he is advocating the blanket killings of innocent people, or the needless destruction of resources—choose your crime. His position is clearly indefensible, and yet, he is vastly superior to you in the skill of debate. He can pull from history more adeptly than you can; his intellect is razor sharp,
He has more charisma and knows how to leverage humor in ways that you cannot. Your defensive shields are quickly breached by the sharpness of his spears and your appeals to logos, ethos, and pathos are summarily thwarted.
You know he is wrong and yet you do not have the tools with which to demonstrate this to him or to the world. You swiftly lose the argument.
Now you are cornered unless you can find someone smarter to stand in your place. You must persuade yourself that his atrocities are justified, or else retreat to the highlands of dogma—maintain your morally correct position even though you cannot, in this instance, defend it intellectually. An honorable retreat it would seem.
Until, we reverse the positions and reveal that it is in fact you who is the bigot, and he who is the moral voice. He is trying to persuade you not commit some horrific crime. Suddenly, your honorable dogmatic refuge has become the very thing that makes you heinous and extreme, a conspiracy theorist.
This, I believe, is the situation that many swathes of people find themselves in. Alienated by an intellectual community that makes plausible sounding arguments for positions I have been told my whole life—emotionally, physically, habitually—are wrong. In stations where I do not have the intellectual artillery to defend a position I know deep down to be right. Where to my untrained eyes the styles of argumentation are indistinguishable, and the content opaque, it is difficult to distinguish the charlatan from the sage, to separate the nourishing from the toxic. It is easy to be confused by charismatic arguments for terrible positions.
I hope this is a sermon on gratitude. We speak often of privilege, but perhaps we neglect one of the most basic forms of privilege afforded to the educated classes—the ability to defend one's intellectual property against the invasions of rogue attackers.
This is also not just a diatribe about mass media or global education, which are both formidable undertakings. But it does raise an important point. Walking through an intellectual arena without the proper training will leave you just as paranoid, skeptical, and distrusting of your surroundings as you would be walking down a dark alley without any means of defense. It should come as no surprise that so many resort to protectionism and dogma. We drink from the streams we trust.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, the beginning of spring means reading outside, throwing around a football, and forgetting about schoolwork. In North Africa, on the other hand, the onset of warmer weather marks the beginning of a time period defined by limited hope and grave danger—a time when an increased number of smuggler boats attempt to transport refugees to Europe from war torn, poverty-stricken areas of the Middle East and Africa. This past week, the fears surrounding these immensely risky escape attempts were realized when a ship carrying hundreds of migrants capsized off the Libyan coast.
This specific tragedy, which appears to have resulted in the death of several hundred refugees, is far from anomalous—particularly this year. In fact, while nearly the same number of people have tried to enter Italy through these sorts of ships in 2015 as they did the year before, the International Organization for Migration reports that the death toll has increased tenfold—a trend that can be traced at least in part to the cancellation of Italy’s search and rescue program, Mare Nostrum. The international community, and particularly the European Union, must work together to protect the safety of these people, especially those that are fleeing from the armed conflict in Libya.
Before its cancellation, Mare Nostrum proved to be an effective program, credited with saving more than 160,000 migrants over the course of one year alone. In the aftermath of this week’s events, the EU should create a similarly robust search and rescue operation as soon as possible, to ensure that people fleeing armed conflict are not drowning while trying to do so. After all, many of the countries to and from which migrants are fleeing are incapable of dealing with this issue on their own; the onus is on the international community to create a concrete, fair policy that will help these refugees.
Today, as the world mourns, Italy is at a loss. As the Italian minister for European affairs, Sandro Gozi, put it: “There’s not even enough space in Sicily’s cemeteries to bury the dead.” But even as complacency and frustration may seem like the most straightforward approach to handling these atrocities—especially in a time of financial restraint and high unemployment in Europe—the international community must not forget that many of the people coming from Libya are fleeing an armed conflict. They are truly refugees, and thus, the rest of the world has a responsibility to these refugees to help them find a home outside their unsafe native land.
Any permanent solution to the North African refugee crisis will have to focus on addressing the problems in the countries from which migrants come. But until these countries demonstrate the capability to change on their own, it is the international community’s responsibility to help protect the safety of these people, whether they are at sea or on land. If we do not act, stories of migrant ships capsizing on the coast of Libya will continue to fill the pages of our newspapers and eat at our collective conscience.

The Harvard Mock Trial Team defeated Yale last weekend to win the American Mock Trial Association’s national championship for the first time in program history.
Harvard rose to the top of the 48 teams in the national tournament—selected from hundreds nationwide—to claim its first national title.
The team has consistently placed in the top five or 10 teams in the nation and has three previous final round appearances, including one in 2006 when they lost by one point to the University of Virginia.
Teammates say the victory was especially poignant as it came just over a year after the death of team member Angela R. Mathew ’15 in a car accident on the way back from a mock trial tournament on Feb. 10, 2014.
Team co-captain Zach J. Lustbader ’16 emphasized the value of the strong mock trial community.
“We’ve come a long way in the past year,” he said, “and we know we couldn’t have done it if we hadn’t all worked together.”
Harvard is also the first Ivy League school to win the AMTA national championship, according to Lustbader and fellow co-captain Neil M. Alacha ’16.
According to Alacha, schools like the University of Virginia and Princeton have “armies” of coaches, often alumni, which some argue put student-run teams at schools like Harvard and Yale at a disadvantage.
“I felt good about the fact that it was Yale because it shows that student-run teams can do just as well,” he said.
For new team member Jordan A. Alston-Harmon ’17, the excitement came not from the well-known rivalry between the schools but from the intense competition.
“Both teams wanted to go in and do the best they could,” he said. “Of course we all wanted to win, but it wasn’t the same [as the Harvard-Yale football game].”
In the AMTA tournament, teams of six to 10 members argue a fake court case in front of a group of judges. Participants play the roles of both attorneys and witnesses and are scored on their knowledge of the case, speech skills, and improvised responses to the other team’s strategy.
For his remaining two years at Harvard, Alston-Harmon said he is looking forward to continuing to improve his mock trial skills.
“And I would have no complaints if we have two more national championships,” he added.

Nine years after Harvard installed its first FieldTurf surface in Harvard Stadium, work has begun on a complete resurfacing of the field.
The project, which will bring hybrid turf technology to the stadium—including a softer underlayer to reduce the likelihood of concussions—began on April 6 and is set to conclude by June 8. The project will also install new goalposts and overhaul electrical work on the perimeter of the field, according to Timothy P. Troville, associate director of athletics.
The new artificial turf surface will allow for increased performance and durability, according to Troville. The turf that Harvard is currently installing on the field combines two systems, monofilament fibers and slit-film fibers, Troville said.
“The monofilament systems most closely replicate the grass blade, but they are not able to hold up to the rigors of scheduling,” Troville said. “The slit-film system is very durable and can handle hours and hours of use, but it lacks on the performance side in some ways. The combination of the two will give us the performance we’re looking for.”
Troville added that the demands Harvard’s club and varsity teams place on the field require such durable turf. In contrast to fields at competing athletic programs—which may not allow intramural or club sports to share varsity fields—Harvard Stadium sees usage rates much higher than the “25 percent usage” he said monofilament systems are usually capable of sustaining.
The field improvements go beyond new turf. Josh Atkinson, a landscape architect from one of two architectural firms Harvard is contracting for the project, added that beneath the turf his firm is installing an innovative sublayer. This “styrofoam-like” surface, about an inch thick, is intended to reduce blunt force head trauma associated with concussions and other injuries.
This new layer, or “underlayment,” according to Atkinson, has become increasingly popular at collegiate and professional athletic facilities as information about the danger of concussions continues to enter the public eye.
Additionally, Atkinson said Harvard plans to install new football goalposts that meet NFL standards of a crossbar that is 10 feet above the ground. It will have uprights that extend 45 feet high, which is higher than the NCAA minimum.
Kenny R. Smart ’18, a kicker for the football team, expressed excitement about the upcoming changes.
“The new turf will help with kicking consistency because the spot of the hold will always be level,” he said. “That and the new goalposts are exciting for me.”

Roughly 75 supporters of a petition calling for the College to cap undergraduate section sizes at 12 students each gathered Tuesday to conclude a months-long signature drive, with two supporters ultimately delivering the petition to Massachusetts Hall.
The Harvard Teaching Campaign, which organized the petition, came into existence early last spring as a way to improve the experience of teaching fellows, according to one of the group’s organizers, Cristina V. Groeger ’08.
Campaign organizers thought that the issue “would have widespread appeal to undergraduates and faculty,” Groeger said. While their experiences vary greatly, TFs have shared feelings of being overworked and other common struggles.
The group began collecting signatures for the petition in spring 2014. At the time of delivery, it had garnered 2,273 signatures, with 1,103 undergraduates, 685 graduate students, 113 faculty members, and 81 alumni as signatories.
Before delivering the petition Tuesday, supporters gathered in the Science Center Plaza, processing past the statue of John Harvard and around to Mass. Hall, the building that houses the offices of University President Drew G. Faust and other administrators. The group of supporters consisted mostly of teaching fellows, undergraduates, and faculty members, some of whom then spoke before the petition was delivered to the front desk in Mass. Hall.
“If sections were smaller, that would be baller,” supporters chanted throughout the send off. After passing the statue of John Harvard, the group switched to a new rhyme: “Large sections cause infections.”
Several supporters also spoke to the group, pointing to the benefits that smallers section sizes would have on improving the effectiveness of TFs’ education.
Edward J. Hall, a Philosophy professor and the chair of the General Education Committee who spoke to the crowd, said after the event that problems with large sections are particularly acute in the Gen Ed program, in which courses can often become unexpectedly large.
“I know from teaching that if my students are going to be motivated, it’s partly because there’s some kind of personal investment to me or the rest of the teaching staff,” Hall said, “and there’s no way that can happen in an 800-student course if the sections are 18 to 20 people.”
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay H. Harris stood outside Mass. Hall as the group approached and joined the group to listen to the speakers. Harris had been invited by campaign organizers, according to Groeger.
“We appreciate the efforts of the Teaching Campaign in advocating for ways to improve undergraduate education,” Harris wrote in an email, “and we look forward to working with the campaign and our entire community to make our students’ experiences in sections and labs as enriching as possible.”
The campaign has received endorsements from 15 departments, committees, and programs, as well as the Graduate Student Council, Undergraduate Council, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones. The UC put the question on section size caps to a referendum last November after supporters collected the required signatures.
Moving forward, Groeger said campaign organizers hope that in the future the campaign can work with departments to get a vote supporting a section size cap from the Faculty as a whole. She also mentioned that organizers would like to hold another town hall meeting like the one convened by Harris and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana with faculty and campaign members in December 2014, where they discussed more flexibility and a centralized mechanism for assigning TFs to sections, as well as the quality of undergraduate education in the College.

A man exposed himself in a hallway near a laundry room in Quincy House Sunday, according to a community advisory email issued by Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano Tuesday morning.
The incident reportedly took place on the sixth floor of New Quincy, according to an email by Quincy House Resident Dean Judith F. Chapman to Quincy affiliates Sunday evening.
A female Quincy resident reported the incident at approximately 12:45 p.m. on Sunday, and officers responded “immediately,” according to the advisory.
Upon arrival, officers “located an individual fitting the description,” as reported in HUPD police logs. However, as the officers approached the suspect, he ran away and a foot chase ensued.
“HUPD then called the Cambridge Police Department for help as the man fled toward St. Paul’s church, but unfortunately, he eluded them,” wrote Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde in an email to the College Tuesday afternoon.
The suspect, still at large as of press time, is described by the advisory as being “approximately 5’ 10”, medium to heavy build, dark complexion, blemished face, wearing a tweed hat and sport coat and shorts.”
In her email to Quincy residents, Chapman said she did not know how the man got into the building but speculated that he obtained entrance to the house via “piggybacking,” wherein a non-affiliate follows a Harvard affiliate into a given secure building.
Lassonde, in his email, noted that while improving weather conditions may lead some students to leave doors open, he wrote that it was necessary to remain vigilant and exercise caution to keep the community safe.
Steven G. Catalano was unavailable for immediate comment.

An art installation featuring student faces projected onto the John Harvard Statue and an accompanying audio track of their voices debuted on Tuesday night in the first work that Krzysztof Wodiczko, a professor at the Graduate School of Design, created on Harvard’s campus.
Wodiczko, an artist renowned internationally for his projections and artworks in the public domain, designed the artwork to feature the faces and voices of undergraduate and graduate students. Approximately twenty student participants volunteered to share their perspectives, Wodiczko said.
The projection was commissioned by the Harvard University Committee on the Arts as part of “Harvard’s strong commitment to increasing the presence and accessibility of art on campus,” Lori E. Gross, associate provost for arts and culture, wrote in an e-mail.
The installation was intended to launch on Monday but was delayed due to the weather. It will run every evening until next Monday, April 27th.
According to Wodiczko, he was encouraged by GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi to create a project right on Harvard’s campus.
“People know that I am developing those projects all over the world,” Wodiczko said. “I was approached with a question that perhaps I should be doing something here on the campus as well.”
Upon agreeing to develop artwork at the University last fall, Wodiczko thought of many potential sites but eventually chose the John Harvard statue.
“This sculpture is already a kind of projection-animation in itself because the sculptor [Daniel] Chester French was clever enough...that rather than depicting John Harvard, he choose one of the students, or some kind of idealized type of student to impersonate Harvard,” Wodiczko said. “Since it already happened I thought maybe I should continue this and create conditions for students to animate this ‘student,’ one student who stands for Harvard.”
With the help of the Office for the Arts, Wodiczko was able to attract a diverse group of student participants, he said.
Looking back on the many perspectives shared within the artwork, Wodiczko found that the projection was an “eye-opener,” allowing him a glimpse of the student experience at Harvard.
“I realize how exciting, and at the same time how difficult, it is for the [students] to jump into the way Harvard University operates and so forth,” he said.
Lylee Kazem, a master’s student at the Graduate School of Education, emphasized the projection’s capacity to display Harvard’s diverse community.
“People who have crossed this statue have come from every corner of the world, represent every mindset and belief out there. That’s powerful,” Kazem said.
For senior Zeenia L. Framroze ’15, Wodiczko’s project offered her the opportunity to reflect on her Harvard experience.
“It was a good capstone to my senior year,” she said.

Representatives from the Boston Redevelopment Authority, Boston College, and the Boston College Allston-Brighton Task Force met Tuesday to discuss the process of submitting project proposals for BC’s $2.5 million Neighborhood Improvement Fund.
The program is intended to finance public projects that may include benefits to public parks, open space, neighborhood beautification, transportation improvements, and public art. The fund is part of of BC’s larger Institutional Master Plan, which calls for $800 million in construction and development on BC’s campus by 2020. Projects financed by the Neighborhood Improvement Fund will be spread over this period.
“This is our first grant cycle, and it has a bit of a learning curve,” Gerald Autler, the BRA’s senior project manager, said during the meeting which took place at the Brighton Marine Health Center. “We are open to any proposals that come forward.”
The proposal process consists of submitting an application for review by BC and the Boston Redevelopment Authority. According to Autler, this upcoming grant cycle marks the first in a series of grant cycles.
Autler said that there is a $100,000 funding cap on individual proposals during this first cycle.
“We want to get our feet wet, so we are not open to larger grants, but we’ll have another grant proposal in the fall,” he said. Beyond 2015, Autler said that the fund will have two proposal cycles per year.
This proposal is similar to Harvard University’s $5.3 million public realm flexible fund. The fund is intended to finance proposals that develop later on in Harvard’s construction process in North Allston, according to Kevin Casey, associate vice president for Harvard Public Affairs and Communications. Casey added that a task force will form in the coming months to determine how those funds will be allocated. The flexible fund is part of the University’s larger Institutional Master Plan.
Alana Olsen, executive director of a nonprofit organization called Allston Village Main Streets, said that she is “excited to see BC encouraging discussion about the purpose of public spaces and for pushing nonprofits to think creatively and long term.”
She added that while Harvard’s fund is mostly limited to North Allston, BC’s Neighborhood Improvement Fund is considering funding more neighborhoods.
Joan Perkins, manager of Sweet Sisters, an artisanal food company, said the fund would support small businesses. She added that she plans on submitting a proposal to the Neighborhood Improvement Fund.
Autler emphasized that the Improvement Fund was still in its growing stage. “The more help we get in spreading the word, the better.”
The BRA and BC are set to vote on project proposals in April.

A week and a half after a sexual conduct climate survey opened to Harvard students, 37 percent of eligible students have completed it, according to response rate results updated online by University’s Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault.
Although administrators praise the response rate so far, students who are currently studying abroad or taking time off from school are not able to take the survey, prompting some criticism.
The survey, which is a Harvard-specific version of an Association of American Universities poll being conducted at 28 schools, was released through individualized links to students at Harvard on April 12 from research company Westat, which is administering the survey. It will be open until May 3.
Forty percent of students have completed at least part of the poll, and 43 percent have opened the survey link, according to the results on the Harvard task force’s website.
Administrators have said that they hope to cull a high response rate from students. So far, undergraduates have received messages from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and University President Drew G. Faust promoting the survey in addition to emails from Westat.
Leah Rosovsky ’78, University vice president for strategy and programs, said each of Harvard’s schools is using specific ways to promote the survey, such as posters or messages from deans or House masters. She said she hopes student organizations will encourage their members to participate in the survey.
There have been some hiccups in the survey’s rollout that may have confused some students. When Faust emailed students about the survey, her initial message went to at least some students’ spam folders. And according to David I. Laibson ’88, a member of the Harvard task force who helped spearhead the design of the national survey, some students mistakenly associated the climate survey email with environmental activist group Divest Harvard’s “Heat Week” protests, prompting them to delete or ignore the survey email.
Additionally, Laibson, who is an Economics professor, acknowledged that the administration has to compete with students’ overflowed inboxes.
“People’s attention is scarce,” Laibson said. “And you can’t expect every email to get noticed or read, or even correctly read in the case of the ‘Heat Week’ misinterpretation.”
Those issues aside, not all students who want to take the survey have been able to do so. Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, who is studying abroad in Spain, received the message from Faust about the survey’s launch but did not receive the link from Westat inviting her to participate.
When she reached out to survey administrators about why she did not receive the link, they informed her in an email that she could not take it.
“We have spoken with contacts at Westat, who informed us that the primary reason for not including this group of students is that they will not have the same access to distress resources,” the Sexual Conduct Survey Team wrote to Suslovic, according to a copy of the exchange she shared with The Crimson. “We do hope, however, that you and other students in this position will be able to weigh in during subsequent surveys.”
Survey designers have repeatedly warned that the sexual climate survey is sensitive in nature and therefore may trigger a post-traumatic stress reaction for sexual harassment survivors. Suslovic, though, said she was concerned that voices of students studying abroad or taking time off would not be taken into account.
“Especially considering that sexual harassment or sexual assault on campus may be a motivating factor in a student's decision to take time off, the fact that this survey isn't interested in hearing these students' experiences is a real problem in my opinion,” Suslovic wrote in an email.
Laibson said in an interview Tuesday afternoon that he was unaware that students abroad or taking time off could not take the survey.
“I understand why that’s a reasonable place to end up,” Laibson said. “The trade-off is that you want everyone involved; on the other hand, you want people to have support services if they need them.”
Overall, Laibson said he has received primarily positive feedback from students about survey. Laibson declined to say what specific criticisms the survey has received. He said there were few and that he did not have permission to share them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of speakers discussed ways to improve ballot initiatives at the Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation Tuesday afternoon. The panel specifically focused on the Citizens’ Initiative Review program currently in place in Oregon.
Speaking before a small audience composed of Harvard faculty, students, and members of the community, panelists spoke about Massachusetts House Bill 561, which would create a program modeled on the CIR to analyze ballot initiatives.
Through the CIR, panels of 18 to 24 randomly-selected, demographically representative voters analyze ballot initiatives for an election cycle, and then draft a statement that is included in the voter information packet. Similar programs were piloted in Colorado and in Phoenix, Ariz., in 2014.
The panel, titled “Getting to Yes (or No): Making Ballot Initiatives More Voter-Friendly and Deliberative,” was moderated by Brandeis University professor Carmen Sirianni. The panel consisted of Pennsylvania State University professor John Gastil, executive director of Healthy Democracy Oregon Tyrone Reitman, and Massachusetts State Representative Jon Hecht, who is sponsoring House Bill 561.
Gastil discussed his research on the initiative, and said his team found that, after the CIR was introduced in Oregon, the percentage of Oregonians who read provided statements about ballot initiatives increased between 2010 and 2014, though still remained under 50 percent.
Reitman, whose organization Healthy Democracy Oregon spearheaded the push to introduce the CIR in Oregon, said that it grew out of “common areas of concern that are expressed by voters and by elected officials around the quality of information that voters receive during contested ballot measure questions in particular.”
Hecht said that the Massachusetts bill’s language is closely modeled after the Oregon program, and said he would be open to changes in the bill. He noted that he hopes to see this rolled out as a privately-funded pilot program during the 2016 election cycle.
In a question and answer session following the panel’s introductory remarks, Reitman said that resistance to the CIR largely came from those involved in campaigns surrounding the ballot initiatives.
“The greatest pushback has come from those groups that feel that the CIR takes away their ability to control their campaign message,” said Reitman.
In an interview following the event, Hecht said the panel provided him with an opportunity to get feedback on his proposal from experts and those who have experience with ballot initiatives.
“[This is] a chance to sort of get their sense of how it’s worked and what sorts of problems they’ve encountered along the way, and that’s the kind of information we need in order to think about whether this would be workable in Massachusetts,” Hecht said.
Several audience members reacted positively to the event.
“I thought the panel was very informative and was a really good lineup of speakers,” said audience member Rikki J. Dean, a visiting democracy fellow at the Kennedy School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard receives $48,000 per student in tax subsidies and appropriations from local, federal, and state authorities, an amount that dwarfs the tax subsidies of nearly all other colleges in Massachusetts, a study published this month by the Nexus Research and Policy Center found.
The study argues that Harvard and all other institutions with endowments over $500 million should pay an excise tax on a sliding scale ranging from .5 to 2percent on their endowments annually. If implemented, the tax would generate approximately $5 billion of revenue, according to the study.
“It is only fair that Harvard and its wealthy peers step up and pay back a part of what the nation’s taxpayers have granted them through tax exemptions,” wrote the study’s co-authors Jorge Klor de Alva, the president of Nexus, and Mark Schneider, a vice president for the American Institutes for Research.
In comparison, the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, the flagship public institution in the state, receives only $9,900 in tax subsidies per student, according to the study. Princeton received more than $100,000 in tax subsidies per student, while Stanford and Yale both eclipsed $60,000.
The authors noted in their study that “the proposed tax should be able to be offset annually by the amount the school appropriates for financial aid,” preventing lower- and middle-income students from receiving reduced financial aid packages as a result of the excise tax.
The authors noted that the revenues could nearly fund the $6 billion proposal by the Obama administration to make community college completely free for eligible students. However, Klor de Alva argued that the funds could help elevate national education levels if allocated not just to community colleges but more broadly to higher education as a whole.
“It would be a much more fair redistribution of money that the nation needs in order to improve higher education, and I think that’s a big contribution that these institutions could make,” he said.
This is not the first time such an idea has arisen but failed to be enacted. Former U.S. Representative David L. Camp proposed last year that particularly wealthy institutions pay a 1 percent excise tax on their endowments, and the Massachusetts House of Representatives considered a 2.5 percent tax in 2008.
“[The Massachusetts House proposal] was opposed by the alumni—these are powerful people—and the initiative died,” Schneider said.
For its part, Harvard contends that the endowment provides important funding for programs that impact those outside of Harvard’s gates.
“Tuition and sponsored research, the two other major sources of financial support for universities, do not cover the full cost of the education or research that Harvard and its peers support,” University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email.
As examples of the impact that Harvard’s endowment supports, Neal cited the University’s role as the fifth largest employer in the state, the $1.3 billion it spent on construction in the past year, and its efforts to have a positive impact on the community through numerous programs.
In the past, Harvard has not completely fulfilled the “payment in lieu of taxes” program the city of Boston conducts. Last year, the University paid only slightly more than 50 percent of the $4.3 million the city of Boston requested to offset the cost of municipal services, citing monetary and programmatic contributions that benefit the residents of Cambridge and Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping its last two nonconference games, the Harvard softball team came out in full force Tuesday afternoon, defeating Bryant, 9-3, at Soldiers Field.
The Crimson (21-19, 11-5 Ivy) received contributions from its entire roster as all four of the team’s pitchers were on the mound for at least one inning, and four pinch hitters capitalized on opportunities to have at bats against the Bulldogs (15-28, 6-6 NEC).
“I thought it was a great game,” senior infielder Katherine Lantz said. “Everyone contributed. We haven’t had a game where everyone’s gotten the chance to play ever. I think that was the most people we’ve gotten in a game all season.”
Harvard saw hits come from nine different players in the lineup, with senior outfielder Andrea Del Conte leading the way with four hits and three runs batted in. The freshman class was also well represented in the offensive effort, as Dallas Hogan, Alexa Altchek, and Morgan Macchiarulo were all called upon to contribute to the win.
Bryant jumped out in front first when junior pitcher Elle Madsen hit a ball over the fence in the top of the second inning off of Crimson starting pitcher Taylor Cabe.
Harvard’s offense retaliated immediately as the team rallied to score four runs off of five singles and a Bulldog error in the bottom of the second. Sophomore infielder Catherine Callaway got the rally going with a single to right field, and after a lineout to second base, senior infielder Adrienne Hume added a single of her own to right field, advancing Callaway to second base. Junior outfielder Zoe Galindo came up with a bunt single to load the bases for Lantz, who delivered with a single up the middle to drive in a run.
A pitching change could not stop the Crimson offense as Del Conte stepped up to the plate and ripped a single up the middle, driving in two runs. A costly throwing error allowed Harvard to tack on another run, and by the time the dust had cleared, the team harnessed a 4-1 lead.
“[The goal was] just to be relaxed and come out and play hard,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “And they did. They attacked early and kept the pressure on. That’s the other thing—they didn’t stop, and that was great to see.”
After surrendering two runs in the top of the fifth, the offense went to work once again. Junior Haley Davis led off the bottom of the inning with a double to left-center, and she was driven in two batters later on sophomore Gianna Panariello’s single to center field. Panariello was called out at home on a fielder’s choice later in the inning, but the next three batters reached, once again bringing Del Conte to the plate with an opportunity to drive in runs.
Back to back singles from Del Conte and sophomore pinch hitter Jillian Leslie tacked on two more runs, making the Crimson’s lead 8-3. The final run came in the bottom of the sixth when Dallas scored on a fielder’s choice.
The pitching duties were split between all four of the available arms on Harvard’s roster. Cabe got the start and pitched three strong innings before junior Morgan Groom came in in the fourth. Groom was replaced two innings later by senior Gabrielle Ruiz, and classmate Laura Ricciardone was called upon in the top of the seventh to record the final three outs of the game.
“We’re going to need everyone, and that’s not limited to the field players,” Lantz said. “That includes the pitchers as well. I think the more pitchers that we can get in, the better. Dartmouth’s a good hitting team, and I would hate to see them see the same pitcher[s] over and over again and time them. And all of our pitchers are really good. They all have different stuff, and they work really well together.”

You may know a lot about this year’s Yardfest artist Jessie J, but do you know a lot about the band that’s opening for her, Black Tie Affair? Flyby got an exclusive interview with Jamasb J. Sayadi ’17 (guitar), Pranav Krishnan ’16 (guitar), Maximillian G. Seiss ’17 (bass and guitar), Jacob H. Seidman ’16 (drums), and Vibav H. Mouli ’16 (vocals), the members of Black Tie Affair.
Flyby: So how did Black Tie Affair get together?
Vibav: Fate.
Pranav: I knew each of these guys individually, and I wanted to be in a band, so it made sense, because they’re all really good.
Jamasb: Yeah, we just jammed together individually before jamming as a whole.
Flyby: So how would you characterize your music?
Pranav: Think “middle school rock.”
Vibav: It’s like 2000’s rock
Max: And it’s kind of poppish and rockish.
Flyby: [nonsequitur] Are you guys even friends, or...?
Vibav: Well, now most of us are friends!
Jake: We usually eat together and hang out before gigs, so by default, we became good friends.
Pranav: Basically we were forced into our friendships.
Jamasb: It’s like an arranged marriage.
Max: By Pranav and Vibav.
Flyby: So who's who in this group? What are the different personalities?
Vibav: Pranav is the one who never takes his shirt off. Everyone wants him to take his shirt off, but he doesn’t.
Max: Jamasb is the cynic. He will just play no matter what.
Pranav: Jake loves the jamming. Vibav loves the jamming. We all love jamming. But Max is a perfectionist. He’s the guy who never wants to play two songs by the same artist.
Vibav: Pranav has an interesting background. He’s played at every Yardfest he’s been here, each time with a different band.
Flyby: What kind of musical experience do you guys have?
Pranav: Vibav was on American Idol.
Vibav: I’ve been singing since I was three.
Flyby: Can you sing for us right now?
Vibav: No.
Pranav: Jake can sing.
Jake: I am capable of singing, yes.
Vibav: A cool fun fact is that everyone here can play some instrument other than the one they’re playing for the band...except for me.
Max: Yeah, you’ll leave for a bathroom break in the middle of rehearsal and you come back and everyone’s playing a different instrument, actually playing with real competence.
Flyby: What's the best part of being in this band?
Vibav: The dudes.
Pranav: Also it’s just fun to play music all the time.
Max: It’s fun playing songs that everyone knows. We mostly play covers. We do songs like Dance, Dance by Fall Out Boy, Everybody Talks by Neon Trees, This Love by Maroon 5, Move Along by the All-American Rejects, Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet. Stuff like that.
Jamasb: Another cool thing is that rehearsal doesn’t feel like rehearsal. We have to get stuff done, but we’re also having a good time and doing what we want to do. Just jamming and playing music.
Flyby: What's the hardest part of being in this band?
Jake: Moving things. We have to move speakers, amps, drums, stuff like that.
Pranav: Also scheduling is tough. Finding a time to play together is really hard.
Vibav: Yeah, finding time for rehearsal is the hardest thing about this band. We rehearse in the SOCH Penthouse Studio, which is convenient because four of us are in the Quad. Except for Jake. But we make Jake come all the way here.
Jake: With my drumset.
Flyby: Where do you see this band going in the future?
Jamasb:  Probably keep playing shows, keep having fun. We just want to drink a lot of orange juice.
Flyby: Is that an inside joke I don’t understand?
Max: Well, it’s not an outside joke.
Vibav: Anyway, we have three juniors and two sophomores, and we’re hoping that if all goes well and the stars align, we can keep playing through next year. For next semester we are lined up to play another two to three shows at least.
Flyby: Any gigs coming up?
Pranav: We’re definitely playing for the Quad Formal. Actually, all the formals.
Max: We also play for a lot of independent social organizations.
Vibav: We’re also part of Project B. It’s a thing that Rakesh Khurana is doing where he’s creating more spaces, so there are more parties that are more open to everyone. We’re a part of that, and that should be coming up in the next couple of weeks.
Flyby: How did you guys get so legit? Legit enough to play at Yardfest?
Vibav: Part of it is that we started off strong this semester. We didn’t really begin until the end of last semester, when we played a gig at Kirkland Formal. It was great.
Jake: Then this semester we started off with a couple gigs in February, and the word spread among people.
Max: Sometimes if we know someone, they can set us up. That’s how we got our first gigs. We literally came up to people and asked them, “Can we play for free?” And now people are reaching out to us, with money!
Jamasb: We didn’t charge at all for our first several gigs. Even now we don’t really play for the money. We charge very little.
Pranav: Everyone just loves to play music, and playing music with people has an extra level of fun, and being able to do that for a crowd of people is just the best.
Max: Playing at Kirkland Formal was really important for us. The week before the formal, we practiced a lot. We needed 14-15 solid songs, so we really needed to practice.
Pranav: If we weren’t pressured, this could’ve easily fallen apart. Preparing for and playing at Kirkland Formal really crystallized the band. After that it was pretty straightforward. Once we play for someone, the word spreads.
Vibav: We are, hopefully, pretty good, and people have a good time, and we’re also affordable and fun people to be around, so it makes sense.
Flyby: Do you guys have any catchphrases?
Pranav: Yes. Many. Such as…
Vibav: Let’s get weird.
Max: We eat kale.
Jake: We drink a lot of orange juice.
Jamasb: Do it for Tito.
Pranav: Woogity woogity.
Flyby: How excited are you for Yardfest?
Vibav: It’s absolutely exciting, and we’re really looking forward to it. It’s not like you get to do this all the time—except if you’re Pranav.
Max: We’re all super honored and privileged, and Pranav is just here.
Jamasb: The moral of the story is that Pranav has surrounded himself with very talented people.
Flyby: How did you come up with the name, Black Tie Affair?
Jake: There are many legends surrounding the origin of this name
Max: I had a fever dream one night and I saw Jamasb in this fever dream. It was an image of a golden egg, and then Jamasb just sprung forth with wings on his back. He was an angel, basically. Vibav was playing the trumpet for some reason. There was nothing on Jamasb except for a black tie. He was formless, half-egg and half-angel. That’s how we got “Black Tie Affair.”
Flyby: Really now.
Pranav: Okay, no.
Vibav: We were just throwing names at each other and we wanted something that sounded cool and sounded classy.
Jake: I mean, doesn’t Black Tie Affair sound classy?
Max: We’re a rock band, but we’re a classy rock band.

Mark your calendars because today the healthy fast-food restaurant Clover will open up its first ever 24-hour restaurant! Located in Central Square at 496 Mass Ave., right next to the Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub, Clover HFI will be the company’s sixth location.
Ayr Muir, CEO and founder of Clover Food Labs, said that it’s not just the round-the-clock service which will make this location special.
“We have all sorts of ideas for it,” Muir said. “This restaurant from Clover’s standpoint is by far the most sophisticated one we've opened so far.”
Featuring posters from musical acts that have played at the nearby Middle East music venue, and pinball machines that pay homage to Central Square’s history as a pioneer in arcade games and entertainment, the restaurant goes farther in decorations than the local Harvard Square branch.
The restaurant will also honor its more illicit history—during prohibition, the site housed a pharmacy with a speakeasy in the basement according to Muir, and he plans on having about six different beers on tap.
To celebrate the opening, today at 11 a.m. the location will serve up free sandwiches, on Thursday there is an open house, and on Friday the restaurant will begin its 24-hour service.
Once Clover begins operating around-the-clock, Muir says that customers can expect a special menu after midnight that may include fried pickles, cheesy grits, and the chain’s breakfast sandwich among other offerings.
According to Muir, the inspiration to open the first 24-hour restaurant in all of Cambridge came in part from his days as an MIT student when there were no late night food options, and he predicted that the location would be busy “all night long.”
However, Muir isn’t stopping once he opens the Clover Central Square location.
“I want thousands [of locations],” Muir added. “I was never in this for some little regional thing.”
Clover’s website does promise that there are a couple of additional leases in the works. As a Currierite, I can only hope the next 24/7 Clover is in the Quad. Oh, and that it serves a brussels sprout sandwich year-round.

As a prefrosh, you might have many questions: Which of the eight Ivies that I was accepted to should I attend? Will I be forced to eat swai during Visitas? Can I attend Yardfest?
Oh, to be a prefrosh again! Well let me be the first, but certainly not the last, to give you a taste of life’s disappointments. Yardfest is only open to those with a Harvard student ID. So no… you cannot attend.
You might have a few more questions about this event that you cannot possibly attend. I’ll do my best to answer.
What is Yardfest?  Yardfest is more than a pretense for day-drinking, but not by much. This event, ostensibly a concert, will take place confusingly, not in the Yard, but in Tercentenary Theater, which you definitely can’t sneak into.
Will there be food? There will undoubtedly be food at this event that you will have no chance of eating. Harvard students—that is, not you—will be dining on burgers “with an assortment of hand-picked toppings” and “Kale Caesar.” Yum.
Who will be performing?  Yardfest will be opened by two Harvard student groups—Black Tie Affair and The Intrinsics. If that isn’t enough to make you jealous, Yardfest’s headliner this year is the world-famous Jessie J.
Jessie Who? Jessie J! You might know her from her 2014 hit single “Bang Bang.” No, really—she was the lead singer on that! Despite being soundly upstaged on her own hit single, she is a singer of surprising tenacity. She has even kept singing despite being forced to keep her mouth closed, or full of marshmallows.
Why Jessie? She’s quite well-known and not too controversial. And she even helped pen a modern classic of our times.
“I’m actually not feeling too bad about missing Yardfest,” you might be thinking. Well you should! It’s not so bad! Or at least, it could be worse.
