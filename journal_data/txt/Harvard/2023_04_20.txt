The third annual Harvard Student Composer Festival, also known as CompFest, ran from April 10-15. Presented by the Office for the Arts and curated by artistic director Veronica F. Leahy ’23, CompFest highlighted student composers from diverse genres of music and created supportive spaces for artists to showcase their work for their peers and mentors.
The festival’s Student Spotlight Series took place from April 10-12. Each Spotlight event featured a panel of three student composers and a renowned professional musician to moderate conversations. Student artists gave ten-minute performances of original compositions. Afterwards, they discussed their work and composition process with the featured professional. Once all three composers presented their work, the floor opened for an audience Q&A.
Vijay Iyer — a pioneering jazz pianist and Professor of the Arts in the Harvard Music Department — moderated the first event on April 10. Grammy-winning jazz bassist and Berklee Professor Linda May Han Oh was the distinguished guest for the second panel on April 11.
Leahy, who founded the festival in 2020 and curated the composers as this year’s artistic director, described her primary intention for the festival to be a chance to uplift.
“CompFest is about people who play different types of music sort of encountering each other and inspiring each other,” she said.
In line with this spirit of embracing and celebrating all forms of music, the Spotlight panelists represented a wide variety of genres, from contemporary songwriting to jazz music and classical voice.
Mercedes F. Ferreira-Dias ’24, a singer-songwriter who identifies her music as “some form of indie-folk-pop,” participated in the first Spotlight event with Iyer. She described her experience as one of the best musically artistic spaces she has engaged in at Harvard.
Ferreira-Dias especially appreciated how her moderator Iyer noticed her unconventional approach to narrative structure.
“I feel like a lot of my songs are somewhat formless, or like difficult,” she said. “Not like a traditional pop form. And I feel like I take liberties with repetitive phrases that allow me as a singer, mostly, to be expressive in the way that I want to in that exact moment. He picked up on that and asked me about it.”
“You know when you are doing something intentionally — and usually it’s something that people don’t really notice — and when they do it feels so validating and encouraging?” Ferreira-Dias expressed.
The CompFest keynote event took the form of another Spotlight Series workshop that featured distinguished guest Michael R. Jackson, a leading voice in musical theater whose work “A Strange Loop” won two Tony awards and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. On April 12, he gave feedback on performances from three student-written musicals that premiered on campus over the past year: “Atalanta,” “Queen of Magic,” and “Out: An Asian American Musical.” Leahy felt that focusing the keynote presentation on musical theater was the right choice given Jackson’s expertise and the rich array of student-written musicals on campus this semester.
Mira-Rose J. Kingsbury Lee ’24, who wrote “Atalanta” over the course of 10 years and co-directed its campus production, found it useful to look at songs written for the stage “from just a purely musical perspective.”
“They don’t often get considered as sort of musical works. They’re more often lauded or criticized in terms of their lyrics — or you know — content, or how they fit in the context of the show.”
Kingsbury Lee also shared that although “there is naturally some overlap between people who compose for theater and the people who compose for other media or genres. CompFest is very useful in that it brings those people together a lot more.”
CompFest culminated with a Cabaret performance that stayed true to the festival’s ethos of unifying diverse musical voices. The Cabaret, held on April 15 in the Leverett Library Theater, featured 13 student acts, ranging from an operatic interpretation of a dialogue from “Frankenstein” to COVID-inspired love songs to an excerpt from the upcoming First-Year Musical. Laughter, applause, and spontaneous cheers filled the cozy theater and created a warm, supportive atmosphere.
Emulating the casual energy of a coffeehouse performance was one of Leahy’s goals to make the Cabaret a welcoming space for diverse composers of all styles and experiences to present their work.
Abigail Ory ’23 — a performer in previous CompFests who emceed the event and helped produce this year’s festival — added, “Something that's very special about Cabaret is, while the Spotlight Series artists are selected and curated, Cabaret has no audition process; just first-come first-serve, you fill out a form and you’re in.”
Ory recalled how CompFest’s accessibility was extremely impactful for her when she initially participated in CompFest as a performer: “I hadn’t even really thought of myself as a composer before [Leahy] asked me to do this. I used to shirk the label when it would come up.”
While Leahy and Ory will graduate this spring and hand over the festival to a new cohort of musicians, they are confident that CompFest’s spirit will carry on.
“Every year is going to take on a different flavor, and I think that’s what is exciting about it. But with that said what I hope remains the same is the commitment to a diversity of music,” said Leahy. “I strongly believe that — as the curators and people running the festival — as long as we follow the music, there will be an incredible diversity.”

A Salvadoran girl named Anita attempts to enter the United States in 2020. A Jewish boy named Samuel flees Austria through the Kindertransport during WWII. These two children at first may seem completely unconnected, but in Isabel Allende’s latest novel, “The Wind Knows My Name,” their perspectives are brought in concert. Through these parallel stories, Allende’s novel demonstrates the struggles of migrant children across history. The plot of “The Wind Knows My Name” is timely, but its short length and varying storylines create an overall underwhelming experience.
The novel’s premise is touching and ambitious. Allende traces out how violence, migration, and intolerance affect children across two periods of history that readers may view as disparate. Allende’s treatment of historical and contemporary crises is lyrical in its empathy. However, the horrors of the Holocaust combined with the migrant crisis in the modern United States is a lot to juggle. Allende attempts to include many profound, interweaving stories — over seven points of view are used throughout the book — in only 250 pages, which leads to too much exposition and oversimplification.
Instead of letting the narrative show why the border crisis is unacceptable, Allende tells this to the reader quite explicitly. For instance, on the topic of migration in the United States, the novel’s supposedly-expert lawyer asks, “What’s the solution, Selena?” to a woman who works with migrant children. She responds with a page-long statement concerning border policies. While these scenes illuminate the information that the story intends to impart on its audiences, they also tear the reader out of the story. Allende also underutilized Anita’s point of view throughout the novel. The reader only catches glimpses of Anita’s full perspective, which is haunting in its depiction of violence through the lens of childlike innocence. Yet before these scenes are fully fleshed out, Allende brings an adult into the story to over-explain everything that just occurred.
However, when Allende allows her characters to speak for themselves, the novel takes on a much more pressing tone. The dual stories of Samuel and Anita are heartbreaking and eye-opening. Allende does not shy away from drawing parallels between the plight of Jewish people during World War II and the struggles of those attempting to escape violence in modern-day Latin America. Samuel and Anita do not hail from the same places, but they both face immense hardships during their youth that define how they deal with life. Eventually, their lives also start to intertwine as the narrative progresses, leaving the reader with a sense of satisfaction by the novel’s end.
Allende also uses lush, descriptive prose to immerse the reader in the novel's scenes; readers easily feel the palpable experiences of the characters as they travel from El Salvador to England to California. Samuel experiences culture shock “like a slap in the face” in the bright streets of New Orleans. When Selena goes to El Salvador to research Anita’s family, the reader can almost taste “the pupusas locas, each the size of a dinner plate, filled with cheese, beans, and chicharrón.” The characters’ experiences are immediate and tantalizing, allowing the reader to step directly into their shoes.
The novel could have reached its full potential if Allende had put more effort into fleshing out its main characters and letting their stories speak for themselves. Often the novel’s themes felt spoon-fed, as if Allende did not respect the ability of her audience to reach their own conclusions. Dealing with topics such as the Holocaust and the current Latin American migrant crisis requires much care, but the novel feels rushed. Despite her passion for the topics discussed in the book, Allende’s lack of subtlety and attention given to some characters results in an underwhelming work. “The Wind Knows My Name” is touching, but it could have been something greater with a little more care.

After months of dreary Boston winter, the sun seems to have once again emerged from behind the clouds. With brighter days, it’s time to consider packing up the winter hats and scarves and getting out the summer accessories. Whether that includes sun hats, sundresses, or sunscreen, the warmer weather is almost certainly here to stay (for now). The most important sun accessory, however, has to be sunglasses. Equal parts practical and stylish, the right pair of sunglasses top off a warm weather outfit like nothing else.
With different frames for every vibe, it can be hard to find one pair that goes with everything. That’s why it’s so important to embrace the variety of sunglasses and bring new styles to any closet. Here are a few absolutely essential sunglasses everyone should have on hand to take any spring outfit to the next level.
Wayfarers
Flattering for almost every face, these frames are iconic for good reason. Their classic, timeless shape makes them a go-to for any occasion. Sitting by the river doing readings for class? Wayfarers. Enjoying a beach wedding just before sunset? Wayfarers. Feeling groggy on a pre-class Buckminster’s run? Wayfarers.
Skinny Sunglasses
Trendy and fresh, skinny sunglasses show off a playfulness that few other styles can match. While they’re not the most functional frames for sun protection, their disregard for practicality brings a nonchalant and fun aesthetic to any outfit they might be worn with. In this case, fashion might actually trump function.
Tortoiseshell Clubmasters
Clubmasters capture the best of both worlds with an acetate upper rim and a wire lower rim. Both lightweight and serious, there’s a reason these glasses are still popular nearly 80 years after their invention. A pair of these can be taken up a notch by opting for tortoiseshell plastic, adding an air of refinement to these versatile frames. Pair them with a sophisticated outfit to get that timeless, classy look.
Mirror Sunglasses
These polarized lenses are perfect for training for the Boston Marathon and Head of the Charles, blocking out sun and wind at the same time. These sunglasses alone push the limits of human athletic potential — or telltale signs of the biggest darty of the year happening. There is simply no in-between when wearing these shades.
Wire-frame Sunglasses
A lightweight choice, wire-frame sunglasses allow the rest of an outfit to shine without sacrificing actual sun protection. Available in a wide range of metals and shapes, there’s bound to be a pair that reflects every style. One might “Imagine” — pun intended — a pair of circular gold ones to be a great investment.
Sports sunglasses
Be prepared for anything with these sunglasses. Whether the day contains white-water rafting, coaching the T-ball team, running to class, or all of the above, a pair of these can handle it all. What dad sneakers did for shoe culture, these frames can do for sunglasses — someday. Whether worn for their practical uses or their camp factor, these frames can do anything.
Aviators
When someone says sunglasses, everyone thinks Aviators. Their wide lenses and thin wire frames provide great eye coverage without sacrificing the view. This combination of factors has made these sunglasses the standard to which all others aspire. That and a healthy heaping of nostalgia — thanks, Maverick.

Sarah Natochenny has recently finished her time voicing main character 10-year-old boy, Ash Ketchum, in the English Dub of “Pokémon” — a role she held for 17 years. The Harvard Crimson sat down with the New York City native to discuss her feelings about her personal career growth in the acting industry, and her departure from this well loved anime character.
“Voice acting is acting. To be a voice actor, you need to have a solid foundation as an actor first,” Natochenny said.
Natochenny elaborated that she specifically likes voice acting because it allows her to play any character regardless of what they look like.
“I’m never limited to my body, or how I look,” she explained.
In addition to “Pokémon,” Natochenny has voice acted in many different pieces of media, including the video game “Bullet Witch,” animated series “World of Winx,” and another animated television show, “Super 4.” She has had the opportunity to act in cartoons that are English dubs, as well as written in English.
“In the dubbing world we call original animation ‘pre-lay.’ That's because we lay down the audio before anybody animates anything. Sometimes they'll give us an animatic — which is kind of a rough animation. But everything we do dictates the animation. And dubbing is the opposite, it's already been fully produced in another language, and we get the fully finished animation with the voice actors of the other language — Japanese in anime. It's our job to not necessarily honor their performance, but to honor what's on screen. So it is a different approach,” Natochenny said, discussing the differences between the two styles of voice acting.
Natochenny also discussed the “freedom to improvise” and “change the scripts” when receiving an original animation’s pre-lay in comparison to dubbing.
“But to say that you can improvise very much in dubbing would not be factual. There’s definitely a lot of freedom to improvise and play and change the scripts in pre-lay,” said Natochenny.
It’s safe to say she has a wealth of experience when it comes to voice acting and the anime industry from all the projects she has worked on.
As a testament to all her hard work, Natochenny has had the opportunity to be a guest at Anime Boston — an annual three-day convention in Boston that celebrates Japanese art, culture, and media — and has recently been nominated for a Webby Award. According to the organization's website it is “the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet.”
“It's changed my entire life actually,” Natochenny answered when asked about how fans’ support has impacted her. She also explained that voice acting can be “lonely” at times, so experiencing fans wanting to come talk to her and tell her about how her work has impacted them has been “most rewarding part” of her job.
Before Natochenny started doing conventions, she had limited exposure to this “wonderful fanbase,” and she was quite shocked how supportive they are of her work.
Natochenny went on to share her experience at Anime Boston in conjunction to being nominated for a Webby. The actress said she had explained to everyone at the convention that she was nominated, and stated if she moved up to fourth place she would give away a signed Funko Pop. “And it happened. I actually moved up to third place. People are so amazing. They all voted for me for the Audience Award,” Natochenny beamed as she described the support she got from convention fans.
“At the closing ceremonies, I ran around the audience — I reported back that I've moved up to fourth place, and ran around, and then found an amazing cosplayer actually, and gave him the Funko Pop,” Natochenny recalled.
“What I learned about myself is very interesting, actually, because I used to be very reclusive,” Natochenny said, elaborating on her personal growth during her acting journey.
“Ash Ketchum was my first protagonist, and I kept booking roles, these protagonist roles. And I started asking myself why is that? Why are they casting me in roles that are characters that are so adventurous and outgoing and extroverted? There must be something in me that's like that. So I did a lot of work on myself, and I started to recognize that part of myself, and now I can't stay home at all.”
After describing how her voice acting work has influenced her as a person, she reflected on the end of her time voicing Ash.
“I'm very sad to say goodbye to Ash. I don't think I'll ever really say goodbye to him. He's such a part of me and I, such a part of him,” Natochenny admitted.
Despite this, Natochenny discussed how much Ash has been a part of her life, the events of his life in the show reflecting events in her own.
“We have all these parallels,” she said. “We were canonically born the same year. In 1999, he won the Orange League. I won a bronze medal in the junior olympics for rhythmic gymnastics that year. 2019, he won the Alola League. I won a Voice Arts award. And now it's 2023 — he won the World Championship. And hopefully, I'm gonna win that Webby. I have to win something. Otherwise, I'm gonna go to a claw machine in Japan and try to win a plushie, but I really don't want that to be the story.”
Natochenny went on to describe how she adopted a cat named Pikachu. They didn’t quite get along in the beginning but now they’re best friends. Natochenny emphasized how she will “never forget” the character, and described her story with Ash Ketchum as “bizarre” and “meant to be.”
“I'm also glad that children around the world who watched the show now, and adults alike, have this change to go through all together, in such a safe way. Because life is so full of changes. And to take a character that's so beloved by so many people away from the public like this is, I think a very healthy thing to do."
In addition to this, Natochenny described how important she felt Ash and his journey has been to viewers.
“And it's great that we have 25 years of a character who wasn't that great. He wasn't a great Pokémon Trainer, he made so many mistakes. He finally won the world championship to teach people that you can work hard and persevere and be kind and make friends, and still come out ahead,” Natochenny said as she analyzed the impact that Ash Ketchum had on fans.
Natochenny has not only voiced characters in various mediums, but she has also worked behind the screen, editing documentaries for MSNBC as well as some other projects.
“Power. You have a lot of power as an editor. It's actually really interesting. As an actor, you're serving the production,” she said. “As an editor, you have a much more powerful position. You get to say where things go. You get to say that part is not funny, or you get to take an actor's performance and make it funnier. You get to tell a different story than the story that was presented to you in the footage.”
Natochenny described how sometimes it feels like actors have less control over their careers.
“It's not a great way to feel, because an actor should have a lot of power over their career. It's an important lesson to learn that we actually do have that power,” she expanded on her comparison between acting and editing.
Since departing from Pokémon, Natochenny has been voicing Yuzuha in “Tokyo Revengers.”
“Getting to use my own voice. I'm using my natural voice to play a really cool character. Someone who's just kind of slick and fun, she takes, she doesn't suffer any fools so I enjoy doing that. And it’s fun to do something that's geared towards a more adult audience,” Natochenny shared.
When asked if she had any closing remarks, Natochenny gave our readers some very straightforward advice: “Be the best, the very best. Like no one ever was.”

When Chef Sean Sherman reminisces about the progression of his career, he does not brag about prestigious culinary training or upper-echelon European inspirations. When asked about his motivations, the James Beard award-winning chef speaks of the centuries-long oppression of the Native American Community, colonization, and generations of unchecked cultural erasure.
Recently named one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People 2023, Chef Sean Sherman is a revolutionary of the culinary arts. Sherman is the founder and CEO of The Sioux Chef, a team of Native American artists organized around the common goal of decolonizing North American cuisine and reviving Native American culture through food. He is also the founder of The Sioux Chef initiative “NĀTIFS” — an acronym for “North American traditional indigenous food systems”— a nonprofit dedicated to promoting awareness of indigenous foodways and Native American food access.
The project that put Sherman on the map was his creation of the award-winning Minneapolis restaurant “Owamni,” a full-service indigenous restaurant that aims to promote accessibility to Native American cuisine and embody sustainable culinary practices.
Needless to say, Sherman is at the forefront of food-related activism and an innovative powerhouse of culinary excellence. But this was not without struggle — Sherman has fought tooth and nail to get to where he is today. In an interview with The Crimson, Chef Sherman spoke to the roots of his mission and the challenges his team has faced in implementing their vision within the modern restaurant industry.
“For me, from the very beginning, it was more about coming from a very poor area. There’s not a lot of family wealth to tap into for business ventures,” Sherman said. “It’s a lot of privilege to be able to raise enough funds to open up something like a restaurant. That was probably the biggest struggle, navigating through the system that’s set out against us.”
Sherman’s passion for the deconstruction of colonial culinary practices is where his expertise really shines through. In his work, he prioritizes “removing colonial ingredients like dairy, wheat flour, cane sugar, beef, pork, chicken”— redefining the American pantry.
Those unfamiliar with the mission of The Sioux Chef may be surprised by the classification of these ingredients as colonial. However, the overprocessed foods often credited with rising rates of obesity and diabetes in the United States are almost always characterized by their overdependence on ingredients purported by colonial foodways. Overprocessed wheat flour, unnaturally derived sugars (including the American favorite cane sugar), and refined oils are all examples of problematic culinary staples ingrained in American culture from the inception of colonial America.
“For almost all native tribes, losing access to the majority of their food and a lot of the culture and knowledge around their foods affected things a lot,” Sherman said. “We see a lot more health epidemics, things like type two diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.”
The heart of Sherman’s work lies in combating this institutionalized culinary oppression. “It’s a broken system that needs to change,” he said.
The Sioux Chef’s most recent endeavor is “Indigenous Food Lab”— a market space that features curated Native food products. “Our goal is to be a regional support center to help any entrepreneurs or tribal communities develop any kind of food production,” Sherman said.
According to NĀTIFS’s website, the Indigenous Food Lab is currently in its second phase of “creating regional and Indigenous food access.”
“We’re already planting seeds to operate food labs in Anchorage, Bozeman, and Rapid City,” Sherman said. “The vision is to have these food labs all over North America and eventually beyond, into other countries.”
A key priority of the “Indigenous Food Lab” initiative is adapting to the native cuisines of diverse tribes. “Just in the US alone, there are 574 different tribes that are federally recognized and even more that have lost that status,” Sherman said.
Since Native culinary traditions rely heavily on the environment of their regions, it would be impossible to capture and represent the intricacies of indigenous cuisine in a single restaurant. That being said, the regional quality of this culinary culture, paired with the ever-deteriorating nature of environmental concerns, provides even more urgency for these acts of culinary preservation.
Sherman hopes to expand knowledge surrounding Native cuisine, whether through the outreach of NĀTIFS or the promotion of other region-centric restaurants like “Owamni.” Sherman mentioned restaurants owned by his friends such as Crystal Wahpepah’s Wahpepah’s Kitchen in Oakland, California, and Ben Jacobs’s Tocabe in Denver, Colorado, but highlighted that there are “not a lot” of Native-owned restaurants nationally. “That’s why we started the nonprofit, to help other people develop,” Sherman said.
The Sioux Chef remains steadfast in its mission as expansion moves underway. If readers wish to assist Sean Sherman’s advocacy, he urges them to keep an eye out, extend support towards indigenous food situations within their region, and/or provide directly to the NĀTIFS nonprofit.

It is one thing to create one episode of television so phenomenal that it can be instantly considered one of the greatest of all time. It is another — perhaps equally impressive — to maintain the impeccable thread of a brilliant, unendingly nuanced story over the course of many episodes.
But, to no one’s surprise, “Succession” has now managed both these feats with an ease that is beginning to border on the supernatural. The final season’s fourth episode, titled “Honeymoon States,” was released on April 16 and follows the still shaken Roy children as they attend a high-profile wake for their recently deceased father. Building upon the last episode’s fascination with the unsettling mixture of public and private considerations that immediately accompany the demise of a figure as rich and looming as Logan Roy, “Honeymoon States” turns the late mogul’s lavish townhouse into a metaphorical racetrack, with each mourner jockeying for their chance to win the coveted title of interim CEO. A perfect mixture of grief and grubbing, this bottle episode (if the bottle being imagined is filled with the priciest liquor) stands out for its effortless execution of a rock-solid script to perfectly prepare the way for the rest of the season.
No character embodies the craven opportunism surrounding Logan’s wake better than Tom, who spends no time grieving for his father-in-law and instead scurries around in pursuit of a new “protector.” After a somewhat subdued but masterful performance of level-headedness in the face of death last week, Matthew Macfadyen switches on a dime into a corporate-friendly, buttoned-up panic mode. After the camera catches Tom entering the episode from afar with a perfectly timed focus shift, he continues to intrude. Just like the “clumsy interloper” that Karl deems him to be, Tom breaks into the frame when catching Kendall going up the stairs or cornering Roman in a private room, always mentioning that he is “here to serve” with an almost imperceptible breathlessness that Macfadyen nails. And when such efforts bear no fruit, Tom turns to his favorite pastime of impressing the insignificant Greg with embarrassing details of Logan’s death — a comedic moment in which viewers watch as Tom sates his appetite for power by disrespecting his former ally and clinging on to his only subordinate.
And while Tom begins the episode steeped in selfish desire, it is more intriguing to watch this attitude slowly rub off on the Roy children as the episode wears on. Even though the “Big Three” Roy children begin the episode as a seemingly fortified grieving unit — launching playful jabs at Kendall for seeing “the best grief guy” in therapy, hosting a highly characteristic post-mortem roast of their father, and collectively shooing away a money-hungry Greg — it does not take long for their alliance to show its cracks. In fact, all it takes to implode this union are a few pencil marks on Logan’s private, non-binding list of post-death desires, with one ambiguous underlining or crossing-out of Kendall’s name igniting the sibling rivalry of old (an entirely Shakespearean device, for all those searching).
It is this all-important graphite line that truly gives Jeremy Strong his chance to revive the famous, rich-boy swagger that has marked Kendall’s most memorable and wonderfully-acted moments. Filled with the blind hope that he may have had his father’s blessing to become CEO, Strong is able to manipulate Kendall’s grief into something simultaneously genuine and exploitative as he vies for board votes. For a multitude of reasons, the most prevalent of which perhaps being his desire to prove himself to a dead man, Kendall maddeningly shifts from being a supportive brother to a man desperate for the same power he once denounced, a result of the pure Roy avarice that Strong has fascinatingly and entirely mastered. By the time Kendall ends the episode with a self-assured smirk and one of the best callback lines of the entire series thus far, it is already abundantly clear that he is the man to beat.
Unfortunately for Shiv lovers, it seems like everyone’s favorite red-headed Roy is bound to become a major casualty of Kendall’s rogue behavior. Barred from the chance to bear even the title of co-CEO that the board bestows on Kendall and Roman at the episode’s end, a less powerful (and surprisingly pregnant) Shiv suddenly crumbles under her lack of a loving father, mother, and husband. The creative decision to explicitly represent this shattered emotional state through Shiv’s painful fall down the stairs of her father’s home is a phenomenal one, a rare moment in which “Succession” leaves viewers with no room for interpretation.
And now, with episode four down and feelings of grief fully buckling under the pressure of a relentless search for profit, the stage is set for “Succession” to return to its regularly scheduled programming of big business backstabbing in beautiful foreign locales. Connor may have snatched up his father’s home before any of the other children (good for him!), but the real prize of Logan’s still-warm seat is very much up for grabs.

A spotlight illuminates part of the church’s stage as the hymn slowly fades. An individual emerges and places a sheet of paper on a music stand. They test the microphone.
“A few years ago…” they begin.
What follows is a “personal testimony,” a staple in the Christian faith, especially in evangelicalism.
There is a rhythm to these testimonies, a specific cadence and plot that mimics a social drama. A breach, a crisis — the individual is tested. Through that test, God’s love and truth is revealed and Christ enters into the person’s life.
A beginning, middle, and end — a story that resolves itself with acceptance and salvation.
Church and youth group meetings felt incomplete without the offering of a personal testimony. I can remember countless stories told on Sunday mornings. They celebrated, they mourned, but they always ended in the recognition of Jesus and unequivocal acceptance of Christianity.
For many, the act of finding and reciting a personal testimony was empowering, liberating. For me, it brought an intense and painful feeling of guilt.
I didn’t have one.
Questions riddled my head in a never-ending loop, turning my mental sanctuary into an apologetics-themed pinball machine. Being raised in the church meant I never knew what my life looked like absent from the rhetoric of Christianity. How would I know that God was important or what was keeping my life together if I never had experienced the supposed opposite? (Very burgeoning dialectical scholar of me.)
Personal testimony after personal testimony spoke of being ‘lost’ and then being ‘found.’ As a child, I wondered why I would need to experience being ‘lost’ if I already had the answer: their conclusion. Why go through the pain of loneliness that they went through? Did accepting Jesus have to arise with an ‘aha’ revelation born through the precondition of sorrow?
I remember a conversation with my parents about predestination, the concept that followers of God are preselected. At its crux, you can’t do anything about your salvation; whether or not you accept God is decided before you are born.
“What if I’m not one of those chosen ones?” I asked. “What if I don’t have that ‘born-again’ experience for a reason?”
Others would question my intentions.
“Are you sure your heart is open to the voice of God?”
Youth leaders would tell me their own narrative to try and make sense of my own. It never worked.
Alienation followed my lack of personal testimony.
When I had to give a personal testimony in high school, I lied. I knew what I needed to say; the cadence was second-nature. People came up to me afterwards and said it was beautiful. Only I seemed to know — or care — about its true nature.
And like that, I was left in a liminal space, speaking the language of evangelicalism, but struggling to find content of my own.
***
Over time, I’ve pinpointed my discomfort with the personal testimony: It implies a static version of faith, it is sometimes created for the wrong reasons, and it brings shame to those who may not fit the linear model.
Rather than a painting you work on a bit every day, a personal testimony, to me, is like painting a picture and carrying it around as your ultimate state of being for the rest of your life.
Without an ‘aha’ moment, I felt like I was never allowed to start on my painting. And even if I did have one, I feel that the personal testimony fails to encompass the life-long learning and growing process that I believe faith necessitates.
Many Christians who talk to me today ask for my personal testimony. I feel uncomfortable, forced to turn pain into plot points, and the story I end up telling is so far from what I know to be true. But, according to many Christians, “all Christians have a personal testimony.” You can ‘out’ yourself if you don’t have one. Thus — shame, guilt, and lying.
But my biggest concern with the personal testimony is how part of Christian culture understands it. Many of the how-to guides provided by large Christian organizations promote consolidating a marketable narrative with the purpose of evangelizing. Statements like “Sharing how you came to know God personally is one of the most powerful ways you can help friends grasp how much God loves us” showcase this theme of designing ‘sharable’ testimonies.
Guides that encourage you to “Keep it short… Three minutes is a good target,” “Have a before, how, and after,” and “Practice, practice, practice!” then demonstrate how storytelling can be distorted by a concise, flattening, entrepreneurial culture. This norm can fashion inauthentic narratives, as depth is sacrificed for brevity. Christians attempting to find their testimony may feel ashamed if they question the format or cannot seem to conform to it.
It’s one thing for personal testimonies to be encouraged in Christian culture. It is another for them to be constructed with the sole purpose of being shared, rather than catharsis or healing or personal reflection.
What I realize now, and what I’d encourage evangelical Christians everywhere — especially organizations and churches that serve young populations — to realize, is that a narrative does not need to be complete and tied with a bow to be told. It does not need to come to a conclusion regarding the acceptance of Jesus to be a worthy narrative of faith. Just because a story does not agree with what you’d like it to say does not mean it should not be hidden away until it’s ‘ready.’
Your testimony is not a cover letter. It does not need to be created with the purpose of being shared.
Faith and religion are complicated, delicate, personal, and powerful topics; stories, with their capacity to compel, play a central role. But all forms of storytelling, regardless of ending, should be respected. Those who are sketching their paintings as they go are just as authentic as those who made theirs all at once. We must brace against the instinct to trade the ‘mess’ for snappy, sub-three minute speeches that make a more convincing proselytization.
The flattening effect of pressuring personal testimony is something I’ve confronted in writing this column.
In doing interviews, I ask people to tell me their stories. I ask people to reflect on how faith has interacted with and shaped their lives. I essentially presuppose the existence of their own personal testimonies and rely on them to write and ground my column.
To those I’ve interviewed, to those whose stories may have been flattened or provided out of pressure to have a cleanly packaged faith narrative, I apologize.
I encourage national evangelical Christian ministries, especially those like Reformed University Fellowship, Christian Union, and Cru (all of which are present on Harvard’s campus), to question the assumption that personal testimonies must come to specific conclusions to be shared on a platform, and question the imperative for narratives to be created to be shared. Question why you encourage people to craft testimonies. Encourage the ‘messy’ narratives, and not just in private.
Ironically enough, many will likely read this piece as a personal testimony. I urge you not to. I am painting the picture as I go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard needs an Ethnic Studies concentration.
This was the overwhelming consensus reached by College students in a 2021 survey — one that incoming President Claudine Gay tacitly began to work towards as FAS Dean. But even the creation of a concentration would not be a catch-all solution to a far more deep-rooted problem: Harvard’s systematic neglect of ethnic studies in the social sciences.
As a Government concentrator, I’ve felt this neglect firsthand, as it’s been a struggle to find ethnic studies courses that would count towards my concentration. In a recent interview, the Government Department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies, Nara Dillon, acknowledged to me the lack of Ethnic Studies courses within both the Government department and the College more broadly, expressing hope that recent hires could meet this need.
In the meantime, Dillon said that the option for Government students to petition to count outside courses for elective credit offers a temporary fix.
“We particularly try to give concentration elective credit in these petitions to cover gaps in our curriculum,” she told me.
This message seems at odds with the language of the petition for course credit itself, which explicitly states that courses taught in disciplines other than political science are “unlikely to be approved.” When asked for clarification, Dillon explained that “if about half of the course is political science, we'll go ahead and give concentration elective credit for it.”
However, Dillon also noted that this approach can exclude students from credit-bearing options.
“Almost every field these days uses this term ‘governance,’” she said. “Sometimes the theoretical perspective they’re coming at this issue of governance [with] is very different than what you would find in a political science course.”
But Christina Shiao-Mei Villareal, a lecturer at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education and an expert in ethnic studies education, told me that she would strongly reject such distinctions.
“Who has historically had a chance to define political science?” she asked. “Who has historically had a chance to even define the parameters of what a school of government is supposed to be, or government studies?”
Villareal, who goes by “Dr. V,” was clear about the broader implications of being more concerned with semantics than representation.
“We can’t take a term like academia for granted and continue to say, ‘We need to be accepted in academia.’ No, we need to fundamentally transform it,” she said. “Ethnic Studies does argue that the problem historically with academia was that it was absent of community, of action within surrounding communities.”
Today, ethnic studies faces challenges far beyond the Government Department. This academic year, History & Literature counted 132 courses for credit in European Studies, as compared to 25 in Latin American Studies, while altogether failing to offer subfields for Indigenous, Middle Eastern, Pan-Asian, or Pan-African Studies. Even if these fields were to be created, the College’s area-focused history departments — that is, History, History & Literature, and History of Art and Architecture — only offer eight undergraduate-focused courses in Indigenous history, five in Latin American history, three in Middle Eastern history, nine in Pan-African history, and eight in Pan-Asian history.
When including courses offered by other social science and humanities departments, these counts rise to 19 courses in Indigenous Studies, 26 in Latin American Studies, 11 in Middle Eastern Studies, 45 in Pan-African Studies, 59 in Pan-Asian Studies, and 110 in European studies.
A total of 146 unique courses representing the entire non-white world is woefully inadequate when compared to the 110 courses that exist for European Studies alone. This disparity starkly illustrates the College’s prioritization of white academia.
Notably, these course counts diverge from those offered by the History & Literature concentration and the Ethnicity, Migration and Rights secondary because my analysis does not include language courses offered in subfields — by intention. As Villareal recognized, there is a clear difference between language learning and Ethnic Studies, as the latter “has a very clear, politicized stance.”
“If it is not focused on the project of decolonization, if it is not rooted directly in communities, if it is not intersectional,” she told me, then it’s not Ethnic Studies.
While language courses may not necessarily teach ethnic studies content, it remains clear that such courses can open avenues for students to learn ethnic studies, as recordings of the histories and societies of people of color are far from limited to the English language. With that in mind, there is no denying the complete inadequacy of Harvard’s language course offerings. Filipino — the standardized form of Tagalog, currently the fourth most common language in the U.S. — will only be offered for the first time next semester after years of student activism.
In contrast, even when only ten undergraduates graduated with a degree in the concentration in 2021-2022, Classics is seen as too intrinsically valuable not to teach. Don’t get me wrong; Harvard should offer Classics. But there is no excuse for treating the languages and histories of white people that have been dead for thousands of years as if they have more inherent value than those of billions of people of color today.
When questioned on the lack of ethnic studies courses at Harvard today, administrators, including Dillon, have often offered the same sentiment: We’re hiring.
This is certainly a welcome start; hiring Ethnic Studies faculty is essential. But it’s clear that hiring faculty alone can’t solve the underlying exclusion of ethnic studies from social science concentrations.
While hiring more ethnic studies faculty is itself good, we don’t have to look far in the past to find promises of new hires that have gone awry. Professor Lorgia García-Peña was an Ethnic Studies scholar who had done everything right — she taught popular classes, had the trust of the student body, and was well-respected within her field. Her reward? She was denied tenure in 2019 and, in turn, was effectively fired from Harvard University.
This decision was decried by students and academics alike, the latter of whom argued in a letter to President Bacow that the decision to deny García-Peña tenure would render the University unable “to respond to students’ growing interest in ethnic studies” and “to recruit and retain top faculty working in our fields.”
The truth is, if we don’t tenure faculty like García-Peña, many such scholars will eventually reach Harvard’s eight-year limit for untenured faculty and find themselves forced out of the University’s gates. This creates an endless cycle of instability for ethnic studies at Harvard and renders the excuse that “we’re hiring” entirely inadequate.
At the end of the day, a new Ethnic Studies concentration with more courses means nothing if interested students cannot easily take them — regardless of their concentration choice. When Ethnic Studies courses are relegated to specific subfields and concentrations, they become a sacrifice to take, no matter their relevance.
Fixing this problem will require more than just tacking on an Ethnic Studies concentration — existing concentrations must move away from rigid, exclusionary systems, refocusing requirements around course relevance rather than department name. Doing so will allow students of color to take Ethnic Studies classes that not only accurately reflect their fields of interest but represent their identities, too.
Such a representative education is essential but rarely available before college. In the U.S. public education system, under 10 percent of K-12 class time is spent on Black history; the taught histories of Indigenous people largely end in the 1800s; education on the Middle East is often limited to the context of war; and the histories of Latines, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are often ignored entirely. Ethnic Studies not only teaches the experiences of people of color but also remedies centuries of untaught history.
When asked if she would be in favor of counting courses for elective credit based on relevance rather than department, Dillon agreed, arguing that the Government department had already taken the unconventional step of requiring only 10 courses for the concentration “to promote flexibility and encourage students to take a wide range of courses in other departments as part of a liberal arts education.” This comes in contrast to other concentrations, which can require as many as 20 courses.
Even still, joint and double concentrations are commonplace, and it seems unlikely that students will find room for Ethnic Studies courses until they’re counted for concentration credit everywhere they’re relevant.
Eric C. Henson, a lecturer at multiple of Harvard’s schools and research fellow at the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, recounted that for many of his students, particularly those at the Law School, his classes didn’t count towards their graduation requirements.
According to Henson, since only five of his 27 students are degree-seeking from the school that offered his class, the perception of enrollment may be skewed.
“It looks to the administration like you’ve got nobody showing up or caring,” he told me.
Though there’s no denying that Harvard College needs an Ethnic Studies concentration, we can’t stop there. An Ethnic Studies concentration is a first step, but if it barely has any courses, what have we really accomplished? And even if we add ethnic studies courses, how much have we really changed if they’re only accessible for undergraduate students in a single concentration?
While the promise of new Ethnic Studies hires is a start, we need more than promises — we need an Ethnic Studies department where professors are afforded the same degree of job security and basic respect as their colleagues in other departments via tenure.
Further, to recognize the intrinsic value of ethnic studies, Harvard College should create an ethnic studies course requirement — stamping it as essential to an undergraduate education — similar to UCLA in 2015 and Princeton in 2020.
Today, the College requires that undergraduates take one formal social science course under the Divisional Distribution requirement, as well two General Education courses exploring social science themes. It’s simple: If social science disciplines are incomplete without Ethnic Studies, as other institutions have recognized, then so are the College’s social science requirements.
It’s been over 50 years since San Francisco State’s Third World Liberation Front first took up the picket line demanding the eventual creation of the first Ethnic Studies department in the nation, but the fight for Ethnic Studies is far from over. Change has never come easily, but no politician, no university, no set of handcuffs, can rob Ethnic Studies of its legitimacy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences received a $300 million donation from hedge fund CEO and Republican donor Kenneth C. Griffin ’89. While our Editorial Board has chosen to focus on Griffin’s deplorable policy stances and the possible uses of his donation, we believe this approach overlooks the crux of the issue: Should billionaires be donating to rich universities in the first place?
Our answer is a resounding no.
Reflecting on the ethics of naming the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences after Griffin misses the forest for the trees. Even worse, celebrating the money, as the Board does, reeks of elitism. The Board admires an institution with billions receiving billionaire philanthropy, claiming that Harvard has a distinguished capacity to do social good.
Higher education adds to the social good through instruction and research. Although Harvard provides an outstanding education and does excellent research, neither of these goals at large is best achieved by donating to Harvard.
With respect to instruction, Harvard is only a drop in the bucket of overall college enrollment. Enrollment at Harvard stands at a thousandth of community college enrollment. And, because Harvard is disproportionately wealthy, the school has a comparatively low effect on social mobility. Even if all $300 million from Griffin went to the financial aid program, we think that its impact would still be negligible in making this school, or higher education in general, more socioeconomically diverse.
On the point of research, although we agree with the Board that this donation should go towards studying huge challenges like climate change and democratic decline, such funding would be subject to diminishing marginal returns. Harvard has millions of dollars already devoted for research on challenges of this scale.
If Griffin and other prospective billionaire philanthropists truly care about advancing education or innovation, then they should donate to less well-known places of learning or smaller research foundations that need the money more. Harvard doesn’t have a monopoly on smart people or good ideas. There are other institutions that can accomplish what Harvard can, given better resources.
For these reasons, we find a great material harm in Griffin’s donation — more than the symbolic harm of condoning Griffin’s views pointed out by the Board. This donation represents a missed opportunity to make the most of the money.
The $300 million in the hands of community colleges and historically Black colleges and universities, for example, would go much further in reducing inequality and increasing socioeconomic mobility. As this Board has made clear before, the marginal benefit of a dollar for such schools is higher than that of Harvard.
This is not to say that Harvard should have turned down the donation. If anything, $300 million on GSAS is a better use than the same money on another Miami compound for Griffin. But there are still much better uses than $300 million on GSAS, even within the same realm of impacting higher education.
Given the host of things the uber-rich spend their money on, donating to an educational institution like Harvard is somewhat praiseworthy. It is, however, not the most effective use of $300 million — not even close.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even for a well-funded institution like Harvard, receiving a $300 million gift is no everyday occurrence.
So is renaming one of Harvard’s schools after a donor or those related to them — since John Harvard’s donation almost four centuries ago that named Harvard itself, it’s only happened thrice.
That third school is — as of last week — the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. From now until the end of times or the unlikely re-renaming of GSAS, our University bears the mark of a billionaire, hedge fund CEO, and Florida Governor Ron D. DeSantis supporter — Kenneth C. Griffin ’89.
This monumental change on campus has led to much chatter and conjecturing. One pokes at the timeline of this gift arriving just years before Griffin’s oldest child will begin applying to college. Another snarks, “Thanks for the money, Mr. Griffin! How much are you gonna shell out to influence democratic election processes next year?”
But with the money already taken and the building already renamed (with great haste, it appears), we can only think about how this change has and will impact Harvard.
As we have repeatedly written before, donations and namings are thorny moral areas because they hold tremendous potential for positive change, but also produce undue influences. Thus, when deciding to accept donations, Harvard should weigh the moral character of prospective donors against the good their donation can accomplish.
Naming a school after Griffin was a mistake. By adorning its schools with the names of donors, Harvard condones these individuals and their values.
Griffin is a vocal advocate for DeSantis. Even if not all of their views align, Griffin’s donations to DeSantis have helped enable the Sunshine State executive to suppress African American studies and LGBTQ education in schools — stances we cannot support and hope our University cannot either. Unless Harvard publicly issues a rejection of these positions, it is implicitly telling its Black and queer students that it sees nothing wrong with campaigns to sensationalize, slander, and erase their identities.
At the same time, a $300 million donation undeniably has the opportunity to produce much good — though not as much as the improvement in social mobility that donations to community colleges and historically Black colleges and universities provide.
Well-monied as Harvard may be, the endowment has restrictions and is not infinite. As students who believe that Harvard’s resources can be leveraged for social good, we believe that funding in the right places can further such endeavors, benefitting us all.
We might never know if this donation came with strings, but now that the money has transferred hands, the unrestricted nature of Griffin’s donation means that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences can spend these funds where it pleases. We have only one request: Use this money well, to promote the social good.
Too much of Harvard’s money is wasted — on an oversized under-useful bureaucracy, or unwanted student services. We hope that Harvard will put these new $300 million into the pure pursuit of universal betterment.
From researching our most pressing contemporary challenges (think climate change or the decline of democracy) to pursuing an economically diverse student body (starting with low-income prefrosh recruitment and following through with support systems for these students) and paying our essential workers better (TFs and CAs included), Harvard now has the means to do more.
Best of all, Harvard should distribute Griffin’s money to academic departments that support the communities of color and queer people most affected by the renaming and DeSantis’s education policies. These departments include Ethnic Studies, African and African American Studies, and hopefully a new South East Asian Studies one.
It’s a cliche turn of phrase by now to call Harvard a “transformative” experience. Griffin’s donation carries the power to help our University metamorphose for the better — as long as we intentionally deter Griffin’s name from transforming us, too.

Newly green trees clear a path as groups of teenagers bike and chatter busily in Danehy Park. They ride down a hill and coast by one of the park’s most distinct attractions: the Universal Design Playground, a new addition to Danehy Park built intentionally for children and visitors of all ages and abilities.
With its grand opening in December 2021, the playground is the first in Cambridge to fully incorporate Universal Design — the concept that an entire play structure should be accessible for all. “In addition to physical accessibility, UD takes sensory, cognitive, and emotional abilities into consideration to create an environment that is welcoming to all people to the greatest extent possible,” the Cambridge city government’s website says.
Indeed, following UD protocol, in place of a tire swing, there is a wheelchair-accessible swing. In addition to rope ladders, there are ramps leading into each separate structure.
Rabbi David G. Winship, a frequent visitor to the park, notes the unexpected benefits of the accessible design. “We actually have a one-month-old, and it’'s super easy to bring a stroller around here,” he says, gesturing at the ramp that runs through the center of the playground.
Winship also recalls the neighborhood’s anticipation leading up to the playground’s opening. “We watched it get built and were very excited for it to finally open,” he says.
Winship’s toddler certainly enjoys the new space. She runs up and down the soft, sloped rubber playground base and launches herself over the curved cement barriers built as seating for parents.
But before Winship’s daughter even enters the playground, she always attempts to identify the colorful shapes and figures painted on the bench right outside its gates. As she enters the play structure, she passes vibrant murals, which were painted by local artist Dominic Killiany, an autistic young adult who has difficulty with verbal communication and expresses himself through his paintings.
“My daughter Zara notices it every time we come to the playground,” Winship says.
Not all visitors to the UDP are children and parents, though. Isabella M. Gamble was picking up some coffee and pastries down the road when she stumbled upon the not-so-hidden gem.
“I just kept thinking how if only there were playgrounds like that as when I was a kid,” Gamble says. I would have had a chance to interact with a lot more people and make it more accessible space for everyone. So I just really appreciate that.”

On an unsuspecting Tuesday afternoon in Annenberg Hall, your writer plunges into the unknown. I remove the over-the-ear headphones practically fused to my skin. I shudder without their warm embrace.
For the first time, I can hear the voice of my university, totally unfiltered. It’s cacophonous, mesmerizing, tantalizingly sonic, and… oddly charming?
I look up and take my surroundings in for the first time. Friends chatter with each other gleefully, and every so often, a table erupts with laughter. Sometimes someone flits from table to table, greeting friends like it’s their first time seeing each other after a long war and not simply after their first two classes of the day.
I realize that I may also have to engage in social interaction. I am absolutely floored — and now that my ears are exposed to the conditions — keenly aware of how I am being perceived. With a pair of headphones onlookers admire: Woah. Look how mysterious and esoteric they are. They definitely know that Tame Impala is actually just one guy. But without them: Sitting alone in Annenberg? What a loser!
But I decide to persevere regardless.
Ready to risk it all, I slide my tray and scoot over three seats to the nearest person at my table. As I clamber over, their face seems stricken with horror — neither of us want this to be happening.
I can hardly hear anything over the deafening sounds of cutlery tinkling and students conversing, when all of a sudden, I hear this agitating, grating sound. Is that… my own voice?
I haven’t heard it in so long. I had assumed this whole time that whenever I interacted with someone with my headphones on —brief interactions like “Sorry, but you’re interrupting MF DOOM’s flow” — that I was speaking normally. But over time, I seem to have lost all volume regulation.
“What’s your… concentration?” my seat neighbor sputters out in a disoriented way that seems to really mean “Why did you just move directly next to me, and why did you choose such an awkward way to do it?”
“Philosophy,” I respond, except it comes out more as “PHILOSOPHY!!”
The clinking of plates and the conversational chatter of Berg briefly stop. Mutually stunned, the student and I sit and stare at each other wordlessly for a few moments. I rise and back up, my chair screeching behind me. I do not break eye contact. I read somewhere that it’s essential to making friends.
“I’m gonna restock on some curly fries; can I get you anything while I’m up?,” but this time, I seem to only mouth the words with my voice coming out as an intermittent squeak.
“What?”
It would be really weird not to repeat myself, and not to do it in a manner that ensures they can actually hear me this time, right? So I lean in, a few inches from their ear, and repeat myself.
Shit, I went back to the other end of the volume spectrum.
I back up again with my hands in the air until I hit the back of someone’s chair at another table. My new friend (?) avoids my gaze and puts on their shiny AirPods Max.
Taking the cue, I trudge awkwardly down the row of tables. It feels as though the bust of every dead white man in the room cranes its neck and cocks its brow. In this same room, they saw Zuckerberg pretend not to be a humanoid powered by irrational disdain for girls from Boston University and several hamsters on wheels embossed with the Meta logo. And yet, this interaction was worse.
I burst through the double doors out of Annenberg and turn right. As I walk to class in Sever, my hands are shaking from Spotify withdrawal. I return my headphones to their rightful place and blast Radiohead’s “Creep” on the way to class. Maybe I’ll try this exploration again tomorrow.

In 1987, four years before the fall of the Soviet Union, a diplomatic delegation from Armenia traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts from Yerevan, Armenia’'s capital. Among them was Eduard Avakian, Mayor of Yerevan, who in addition to the documents needed to formalize a sister city agreement between the two cities, brought with him a life-size filigreed silver dove.
This month, you can find this dove sitting behind a glass display case as you enter the Cambridge Public Library. But it wasn’t until this past year that the dove reemerged after being missing for several decades since it was brought over from Yerevan.
“We couldn’t figure out where the dove went,” said Nancy Kalajian, board member of the Cambridge Yerevan Sister City Association. “It was in the photos, and even for the 35th anniversary we thought ‘Where is that dove?’”
Last September, CYSCA reached out to archivist Alyssa Pacy at CPL, hoping that the library archives could house some of their historic material and put on an exhibit for the public. Over the following months, the organization combed through artifacts, determining what would best suit the space in the library and cataloging their items. During the archival search process, Pacy found a box that she thought might be connected to CYSCA.
“She opened up the box and myself and the President of CYSCA, Roxanne her name is, had tears in our eyes because what was in the box? The dove,” Kalajian remembers.
Cambridge and Yerevan became sister cities because of a group of Cambridge citizens hoping to build a civilian bridge between the United States and the USSR to ease inflammatory rhetoric during the Cold War. The cities’ relationship has now lasted 35 years.
The Cambridge City Council established the Peace Commission in 1983 by city ordinance, aiming to foster “conflict resolution and peace education in schools.” Yerevan became Cambridge’s sister city as a part of carrying out that mission.
Philip P. Ketchian, a retired physicist and long-time board member of CYSCA, lists two reasons for why Cambridge was a valuable connection for Yerevan: “The answer is very brief: Harvard and MIT.”
“Yerevan was a major academic center of the Soviet Union,” says Ketchian, who studied in Soviet Armenia and then in the United States. “MIT, during the Second World War, was the center for the development of radar, and so was Harvard. After the war, the engineers and scientists of MIT published a book on high voltage devices… That book was basically the Bible of any electrical engineer all over the world. The translation into Russian was on the desk of just about every engineer or scientist in the Soviet Union.”
Hoping to deepen their intellectual and cultural ties to the world across the Iron Curtain, former Mayor and then City Councilor Frank H. Duehay ’55 and 11 Cambridge residents journeyed to Moscow in late May of 1986. They then went to Yerevan, whose government expressed a desire to formalize the connection between Yerevan and Cambridge.
A letter on display at the exhibit demonstrates Washington politicians’ approval of the connection.
“During the 1985 Geneva summit meetings, both President Reagan and Secretary Gorbachev called for increases in the number of sister city endeavors between our two countries,” Tip O’Neill, then Speaker of the House and Cambridge native, wrote in the letter dated May 2, 1986. “I have had the honor and privilege of representing the City of Cambridge in the Congress for many years and am very pleased that the city of my birth will be one of the first in the United States to fulfill this mandate.”
The successful mission of the Cambridge citizen-diplomats kicked off decades of cultural exchange and aid programs between the two cities, even after the fall of the Soviet regime. These programs have included exchanges involving teachers and doctors. CYSCA has also fundraised extensively for Armenian schools and raised $19,250 for the Women’s Resource Center and schools in need as of March 2020.
In 1988, David H. Bor, an infectious disease specialist at Cambridge Health Alliance and professor at Harvard Medical School, traveled as part of a diplomatic trip to Yerevan. More than 30 years later, Bor vividly remembers one particular conversation with a healthcare professional.
“A man said to me I was the first American he had seen since the 1940s,” Bor recounts. “He was in the Russian army that crossed the Elbe in Germany at the end of the war. He said he was frostbitten, he was cold, he was malnourished, he was lying on the ground and an American soldier came by and picked him up and brought him into his tent. And he said it was the first time he had ever seen a black man in his life.
“This man sat him down and gave him a glass of Southern Comfort. He said that he felt a fire going into his esophagus, into his chest and it felt so wonderful. He had a great debt of gratitude toward America for the humanity that these American soldiers showed this Armenian man, and he wanted to repay that debt of gratitude now, 40 years later.”
Bor remembers how warmly he was received as an envoy. “We opened the door and we went into another room, and there was a big table filled with food, and brandy,” Bor says. “He had prepared a banquet for me to repay his debt of gratitude to America. I was treated in that way everywhere I went. It was quite amazing.”
Although interest in maintaining the sister city connection has waned in the post-Soviet era, CYSCA is seeking to reignite excitement for their work. Ketchian stressed their group’s commitment to facilitating exchange programs for Armenian professionals.
Ketichian hopes that the library exhibit will help people learn about the rich history of the relationship between Cambridge and Yerevan. For Kalajian, although the Cold War has faded into memory, the rediscovery of the dove has been a way of remembering the beginning of this friendship.
“We want to make sure people know that — Cambridge and Yerevan — there are so many things that they have in common,” she says. “Go on a trip to Armenia, explore friendships, and learn from each other in a positive way.”

Before founding Facebook, Harvard’s most famous dropout made a predecessor: Facemash, a 2003 website that allowed his Harvard classmates to rank one another based on attractiveness.
Over the past decade, Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook has received widespread criticism for what many characterize as unethical business practices: abusing user data, using algorithms that spread misinformation, and knowingly harming people’s mental health. And it seems pretty clear that ethics was not a major consideration when Zuckerberg created Facemash either.
“The Kirkland Facebook is open on my computer desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous Facebook pics,” Zuckerberg, a Computer Science concentrator, wrote in an online journal at the time. “I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive.”
But the Embedded EthiCS @ Harvard program wants to prevent the next Facemash. The program is a joint initiative between the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Philosophy. Its slogan proudly announces: “bringing ethical reasoning into the computer science curriculum.”
According to the program’s website, Computer Science professor Barbara J. Grosz and Philosophy Professor Alison J. Simmons co-founded the program in 2017 after “overwhelming undergraduate interest.” Embedded EthiCS “embeds philosophers into courses.” In practice, this typically means a single ethics-based lecture in a semester-long course.
“The aim of Embedded EthiCS is to teach students to consider not merely what technologies they could create, but whether they should create them,” the website reads.
If Embedded EthiCS existed during Mark Zuckerberg’s time at Harvard, would Facemash — and perhaps Facebook — ever have existed?
***
About a month before writing this article, I sat through an Embedded EthiCS talk for a course I’m taking, Computer Science 51: “Abstraction and Design in Computation.” It was two days after our midterm, and our professor referred to the lecture as “a kind of post-exam treat.” Clearly, the students in the class didn’t see it that way. While the course has an enrollment of nearly 200, around 50 students showed up to the lecture.
I understood why. I even considered skipping myself, since in-person attendance was expected but not mandatory. But out of curiosity, I went.
For the first 20 minutes of the lecture, the Philosophy Ph.D. candidate dissected what, precisely, the word “responsible” meant. We learned about the distinction between forwards- and backward-looking responsibility, and how intervening agents impact our understanding of these issues. We were then presented with case studies. We were asked whether Facebook was responsible for allowing users to discriminate by race for housing ads (yes). And whether Amazon was responsible for a hiring algorithm it wrote that inadvertently discriminated by sex (yes), and whether it should have foreseen that (I didn’t feel like I had the technical expertise yet to answer that).
Near the end, she asked us to reflect: In your role as a software engineer, if you can reasonably foresee that a certain design choice or algorithm would lead to harmful outcomes, what should you do?
But after the lecture, I didn’t feel like I had any new ways to answer that. I’m not planning on being a software engineer. But I imagine that if I had a high-paying job at Facebook, and my product manager told me to code a harmful algorithm, I wouldn’t actually know how to respond. Should I downright refuse? Picket? Quit? I also had no idea what tools I could use to foresee harm. Even if, when my algorithm caused harm, I knew I was “responsible” from a philosophical standpoint, I never learned how to actually prevent the harm.
We were given an assignment of a 400-word essay answering this question. I dashed off my response: If I were a software engineer, and I could foresee a harmful outcome because of a particular design choice, I would not make that design choice. I mean, of course — isn’t that what any decent person would do?

In the following week, I couldn’t stop thinking about CS 51’s Embedded EthiCS module. Each time I did, I was reminded of another conversation I’d had with a teaching fellow in a Computer Science course this past fall, when he mentioned that his roommate had taken a job at Meta.
I’ve always had a pretty fraught relationship with Instagram — the way it sucks away my attention and throws me into negative spirals. As it turns out, this was by design: recent whistleblower reports revealed that the company knew that its algorithms caused misinformation and polarization and negatively contributed to peoples’ mental health.
So I asked the TF how his roommate felt about the ethics of working at Meta. The TF told me that he honestly didn’t think his roommate thought about it that much. He was making a huge salary, so why would he?
I know that the decision to work at Meta or any other big tech company can be a complicated one. But like it or not, after graduation, about 17 percent of graduating seniors will work in the technology industry. An additional 40 percent will work in consulting or finance, and will more than likely interact with the technology industry through their work (CS 51 itself teaches the programming language OCaml, which is used by almost no one except the Wall Street trading firm Jane Street Capital).
For Harvard students, the ethical questions surrounding technology are not mere hypotheticals or stories in the news. They are decisions they’ll have to make themselves, potentially as leaders in the industry.
And it seems like now, with the rise of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence, these tech-ethics questions are at the forefront of everyone’s mind. With AI technologies like ChatGPT that can swiftly complete tasks and generate concise, natural language, it’s hard not to wonder whether this technology will significantly alter what it means to be human. And many believe the threat AI poses might be even more harrowing: In one survey of machine learning experts, nearly half of respondents said there was a 10 percent chance AI ends up killing all of humanity.
***
I wasn’t sure if I was the only one who felt this way. I wanted to talk with other students involved in Computer Science to get a better sense of the atmosphere.
One of the first people I reached out to was Naomi Bashkansky ’25, a Computer Science concentrator involved in the Harvard AI Safety Team. Bashkansky and I met on a Saturday morning in the Leverett House Junior Common Room. She told me she hadn’t slept well the night before; she had stayed up thinking about Embedded EthiCS.
I asked her what she thought of the program. She paused for a full 30 seconds before she said, “I think a lot of people at Harvard don’t take Embedded EthiCS lectures very seriously. I think it's, at least in part, because it seems like Embedded EthiCS lecturers underestimate students.”
The questions the Embedded EthiCS answers are too simple, she told me, and the vast majority of people have enough of a grasp of ethics to answer them.
“Often, when you go into an Embedded EthiCS lecture, you kind of already know what the correct answer is going to be,” she continued after another pause. “Like, ‘Don’t harm this population,’ for instance.”
Alexander S. Pedersen ’23, a Computer Science concentrator and former Crimson Tech Editor, agreed that the “actual concerns about ethics in computer science” weren’t being adequately addressed by Embedded EthiCS lectures.
“The first one I had was really good,” he says. “And I think every single one after that has been sort of, almost funny-bad.”
He felt that many of the philosophers had “a pretty noticeable gap in their actual knowledge of the concepts that we’re working with in class.” He remembered the lecture in a machine learning course he took as a “missed opportunity.” Instead of focusing on issues that engaged with the technology — like exploring the “very prominent” issue of how biased data impacts a system’s predictions — he felt that they often focused on obscure philosophical issues.
“It was like some philosophy concept,” he said about the module from his Machine Learning course. “We made some flow chart. Basically, it wasn’t related at all.”
Amy X. Zhou ’23, a former Crimson Business Manager who jointly concentrates in Computer Science and Government, understood how it can sometimes seem difficult to marry Computer Science and Philosophy.
From a Philosophy class she is in about “Ethics of Computing Technologies,” Zhou said she had seen how helpful it can be to have a strong philosophical framework to work through complex, ethical issues. But she also saw how it can be hard to apply philosophy in practical considerations.
But she sees the speed at which technological development and philosophy move as potentially incompatible.
“The philosophy problems are never actually going to be solved, which is why they’re philosophy problems,” she said. “We do have to make a decision at some point.”
“The issue that we run into a lot in my philosophy class is that a lot of the issues that philosophers are tackling are not exactly easy to translate into the practical programming side,” she told me. “So it’s like, what is the practical purpose of discussing philosophy?”
But Zhou also had a positive experience at the lectures she attended.
“They've all been really interesting and cool, and have made me think about the world in different ways,” said Zhou about the Embedded EthiCS lectures she attended.
Another student in CS 51, Annabel S. Lowe ’26 told me she enjoyed the opportunity to learn about “a more real-world application” especially since the CS department typically focuses on “more theoretical” topics.
And even though some students bemoan the lack of technical material incorporated into embedded EthiCS, some courses make an effort to do this.
“My sense in cs120 is that, on the whole, students welcomed the break in non-stop technical material, to think about some of the philosophical issues associated with the algorithms they were learning,” wrote Computer Science professor Salil P. Vadhan ’95 in an email. “And it was pretty tightly connected to the technical course material - for example, we gave a homework problem around mathematically modeling some of the fairness conceptions discussed in the EmbE module.”
Simmons, the Embedded EthiCS co-director, wrote in an email that “the feedback has been extremely positive” for the program.
“Not being able to mount a full battery of team-taught seminars, Embedded EthiCS was created as a scalable way to increase the amount of ethical reasoning education across the CS curriculum,” she wrote.
“Our hope and expectation is that repeated engagement with modules will have an impact,” she continued. “Measuring success will take time since the proof is in the pudding, in this case in the work that Harvard students do once they are in industry.”
“I think it's super important,” Lowe said about Embedded EthiCS. “I just think there are definitely ways it could be improved, but the fact that they've recognized and started it is definitely a big step.”
Pedersen views Embedded EthiCS’s efforts differently.
“I don’t really think anyone’s taking too much away from it,” said Pedersen. “So it’s almost just performative.”
Meanwhile, Bashkansky wishes the program would shoot even higher.
“I think that Embedded EthiCS lectures should have a more grandiose goal of sorts,” Bashkansky said. “But I don’t think it’s the kind of lecture that would make someone question their career and their decision and think, ‘Wow, maybe I should be focusing on more ethical things or something.’”
***
From his blog post musings to the final hot-or-not product of Facemash, Zuckerberg’s ventures have certainly raised ethical concerns.
But the aftermath of Facemash tells things a little differently. After facing outrage from undergrads and administrators alike over the website, Zuckerberg took it down. In an apology letter, he wrote: “I understood that some parts were still a little sketchy and I wanted some more time to think about whether or not this was really appropriate to release to the Harvard community.”
Years later, Zuckerberg would be called to testify in front of Congress about the harm Facebook inflicted through the misuse of user’s data and their role in spreading fake news. Only then would he apologize. And he still denies whistleblower concerns.
Like many other students, it seems like college-aged Zuckerberg had a basic grasp of ethics. He didn’t need a philosopher to tell him that Facemash was “sketchy,” and that he was the one responsible for it. The problem, then, isn’t that Zuckerberg was blind to the questionable ethics of his project; it’s that he knew that Facemash was dubious, but he made it anyway.

Doc: So what brings you in today?
Harvard Man: I am one with the wind. A northbound gust propelled me into this quaint little office with its bright plush couches and artificial succulents. Might I suggest, though, that you add some Freud to that bookshelf over there? Your field would not exist without him, you know.
Doc: Interesting. Along with the wind, I know that your primary care physician also recommended you see me. They said you might be having problems adjusting socially. So why don’t you tell me about yourself — who are you?
Harvard Man: Scoff. How can I possibly elucidate a response to a question that has evaded the minds of the brightest men for centuries? Have you not read Sartre?
But to offer an alternative response — I am Harvard Man. Junior in Eliot House. Concentrating in Social Studies with a special secondary in WAP, which, of course, stands for Wittgenstein and the Art of Postantipseudosurrealism.
Doc: I see. (Jots down “Patient’s dorm is a strangely important part of their identity.”) How would you describe your childhood?
Harvard Man: My first memory is of swimming in the creamy soup of my mother’s womb and wishing she played a little less Spears and a little more Stravinsky. To this day, this has caused a massive rift in my relationship with my mother. Regardless, I was born by C-section. I respect women too much to hurtle headfirst out of their gentler regions.
I’ve been told that when I was born, I cried a lot. What they don’t know is that I cried each one of those tears for every elder eating a meal alone in a crowded restaurant, for all the missed connections between well-meaning but ill-fated lovers, and for all the suffering in this world that has no end and no meaning.
Doc: How does that make you feel?
Harvard Man: …
By 4 months old, I could demonstrate by proof that if baby have wet poopy diaper, then baby need change. I had also read “Das Kapital” cover-to-cover, so I could really sympathize with the family maid who changed my Pampers.
I knew that I had to prove my intellectual prowess to the world expeditiously, as a man’s first few 12 months are the most formative when he is later a candidate for tenure. My papers explaining the social phenomenon of the “crib” through the lens of Foucault’s panopticon and arguing for Gerber banana puffs after every meal as a Kantian universal law sent shockwaves through the philosophy community.
Doc: What about your teenage years?
Harvard Man: High school was… tough. Not academically, of course. I took the most rigorous set of studies at Grotondover Prep. But alas, I was Sisyphus, pushing his boulder up the mountain every day only to watch a cackling group of cross country jocks push it back down to the base. Philistines, just philistines, all around me!
They were all too exuberant to join my “Dead Poets Society”-themed club, but it turned out they just wanted me to stand on a desk so that they could pull it out from under me. Things were rough after that. The very sight of a school desk now makes me dizzy and unsustainably anxious. But Kierkegaard describes anxiety as the dizziness of freedom. Thus, I have never been more free.
Doc: How would you describe your life at college?
Harvard Man: I go to Harvard.
Doc: Yes, I know.
Harvard Man: I don’t think I understand. Can you rephrase the question?
Doc: How would you describe your life at Harvard?
Harvard Man: Ah. Well, as a first-year, I was careful to solidify my image as a member of this generation’s beatnik intelligentsia. I was never seen without a candy cigarette poised between my lips and all 23 Hum 10 books, even in Tasty Basty.
As a sophomore, I decided that the Kerouac thing had gone stale. Though it caused some unfashionable fraying on the patches of my tweed blazers, I took up the practice of hacky-sacking on the steps of Widener. I was a “regular American Joe.” Little did my peers know, underneath that strapping, hypermasculine surface, I had very strong opinions about brands of parchment and feather quills.
Doc.: And how are you doing now?
Harvard Man: As a junior, I have continued the journey of peeling back the many layers of my psyche to discover the refined young man inside. He enjoys bringing a champagne flute to the dhall to sip choccy milk from — it’s the finer things!
However, I have started to find that my normal interests, like practicing equestrianism in Harvard Square and asking women if they’ve heard of Keats, have started to bring me less joy. It’s all very Kafkaesque. That, I suppose, is why I’m here. Along with the wind. It’s probably 70 percent wind, 30 percent Kafkaesque.
Doc.: Hmm, and how exactly are these things Kafkaesque?
Harvard Man: (Jumps suddenly out of his chair) Oh, wow! Would you look at the time? (He unsheaths an intricate pocket watch from his leather satchel.) I must be on my way. There is much carpe to be diemed.
Harvard Man leaves the therapist’s office to return to the comfort of his home. But Harvard Man’s dorm in Eliot serves as his “bachelor pad” — he often studies for his Bachelor of Arts there — and he wants to hang up his hat in a more soothing environment after the interrogation he so valiantly endured. So, he bikes on his penny-farthing bike to his off-campus apartment. Upon entering, his nanny — the same one from childhood — takes off his tweed blazer and helps him change into his long blue, striped nightgown and matching sleeping cap. As he gets cozy under his Dune-themed covers, his nanny reads him excerpts from a working-class, intersectional feminist poetry anthology. It always puts him right to sleep

There aren’t enough "O"s.
We are in Bow & Arrow Press on its Open Press Night this past Wednesday, April 19, before it goes into storage five days later. We are short just one “O” metal stamp to print the phrase “community-led printing for all.”
Since the press opened its doors just hours earlier, it has been jam-packed — there is hardly any space to move. With the help of regulars, we rummage through shelved projects and find the exact 72-pt. “O” we are looking for. We arrange the visual elements and wait for the right color press to open up.
This past Monday, students received official word that the press, which has been around since 1978, is closing and will not return to its location in the basement of Adams House.
All around, people are busy making what they can at the final press run. Some printers work hard to finish the last part of complicated projects, and others, including ourselves, are here for the first time, and a few are making posters for their wedding. By the time we complete our poster, there are three giant stacks of prints to make sure that everyone has something to commemorate the press by. Students use the giant silver presses to ink their selected letter blocks, cleaning up the edges by hand. We hear large clangs as papers are loaded, rolled, and removed.
As Heather Hughes, one of the studio managers, helps others, her co-manager Jonathan L. Biderman shows us the archives — which feature etched blocks made across decades — and lets us look through them to choose one to print with.
Here, in the back of the press, we also talk to Robert D. Anderson ’19., He lived in Adams House during undergrad and is now a mechanical engineer working in the Boston area and volunteers much of his free time to the press. He reminisces about the significant role the press played in his college life — which he says often featured work sessions at the press that stretched until as late as 2 a.m. — before mentioning that he had heard “rumors” of the press’ closing.
“We can’t let this happen,” Anderson says. “There’s way too much at stake to lose.”
When we exit the archives and return to the workshop, we finish making our print. Eventually, Hughes continues the conversation, saying more about her response to hearing the rumors.
“I have a responsibility to this community if nothing else,” Hughes says. “People deserve a chance to say goodbye to this space. If I can do nothing else, that is the bare minimum that I can offer.”
Maria E. “Ari” Cheriyan ’25, who regularly uses the press, attended the journal printing and large type poster printing workshops the weekend of April 14, where she typeset on a commemorative Bow & Arrow poster.
“When I saw that all the type was correct and the ink was done correctly, it just culminated,” Cheriyan says. She recalls “just seeing” the poster and “reflecting on the past year, and all the moments that I've been in the press.”
Aliénor C. Manteau ’23, who learned about the press through her creative writing workshop, says that “it’s really lovely to come together with people that don’t know each other but are all excited.” She notes that she loves seeing the work others produce, wishing more people knew about the press.
After running these workshops the entire weekend, Biderman says the most meaningful aspect was the number of people who come in and learn how to do something “new” and “incredible” that they “didn’t even think of before they came in this space.”
“We have poured so much care and attention and seen it blossom beyond our wildest dreams in many ways,” Biderman says, explaining “how hard it is to consider that the press might not have a future.”
Adams House Faculty Dean Salmaan A. Keshavjee explains that the area currently occupied by the press used to serve as a common area for students of Westmorly Court, who for the past 45 years have not had a common space to congregate.
“House Renewal is a chance to reimagine student spaces, especially community spaces for students in each part of the House,” Keshavjee wrote in an email. “So, after careful deliberation, it was decided that when Westmorly Court reopens in 2025, the space where the press is located will revert to its original usage as a common room for student use and as a gathering place for the Adams House community.”
He said he hopes that Bow & Arrow will be able to “continue its operations at another site in the Harvard community.”
But, on Open Press Night, it was clear how the press had become a community unto itself. Anderson, Biderman, and Hughes all help us make our poster. Julia K. Pastreich ’25 helps us find the correct “O,” and Henry N. Haimo ’24 assists with setting the text font and print copies.
It is this human quality of the press that Biderman loves about Bow & Arrow.
“Each person who comes here, the work that they produce is a story of its own,” Biderman says. “It’s extraordinary. It’s wonderful.”

As air-conditioning billows into the Special Exhibitions Gallery on the second floor, Sara J. Schechner ’79, curator of Harvard’s Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, and Richard L. Ketchen, a horologist volunteering his expertise in clockmaking, huddle around a large table, their gazes fixed upon a contraption made of minute screws, sticks of metal jutting upward, and countless gears, one of which measures three feet across.
Schechner and Ketchen aren’t just here to gawk at the contraption’s complexity and beauty. The pair are finishing the monumental task of reassembling the object — the Grand Orrery — after studying each of its pieces in a disassembled form. The process is almost complete.
Schechner and Ketchen work together on reassembling the Grand Orrery in the Special Exhibitions Gallery of Harvard’s Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments.
Harvard acquired its Grand Orrery in 1789, two years after it was built by Boston clockmaker Joseph Pope. The device is an intricately crafted working model of the solar system made of brass, mahogany, ivory, and glass, complete with once-revolving planets, all encased under a glass dome adorned with stars. The hand-cranked orrery once vividly demonstrated the orbital paths of the first six known planets orbiting the Sun; today, the crank on the orrery no longer functions.
Although the contraption has demanded upkeep throughout the centuries, the goal of Schechner’s and Ketchen’s project is not routine maintenance but historical and scientific insights into the 18th century, involving intensive study of the materials that were sourced, how exactly they were placed together, and the way the orrery was used by various actors. This work is in anticipation of a workshop titled “Creating an Ordered World in Disordered Times: The Pope Orrery,” which will draw horologists, conservators, and a host of other specialists next November.
The orrery serves as a “mise-en-scène for an examination of Boston and the British world during the American Revolution,” Schechner writes in an email. It was and is “a spectacle, prestige item, and model for teaching natural philosophy and religion,” she adds, which can reveal aspects of the state of American and British politics, economics, labor, and technology at the time.
Intricate models like this, though, weren’t typically owned by schools but by dukes, duchesses, and aristocrats — like the Earl of Orrery, whom the instrument is named after — as symbols of their education and refined taste.
Schechner explains that many craftspeople worked on the orrery. “Their tool marks are as fresh as fingerprints on the instrument,” she writes. The work of these artisans, however, was conducted under the imminent threat of conflict — the American Revolution.
“We see evidence of the war in the selection of materials used in the construction of the orrery, as well as in the political fervor that led to the statuettes of Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, and James Bowdoin (governor of the new Commonwealth of Massachusetts) on it,” Schechner wrote in an email.
The statuettes that decorate the Grand Orrery were cast by Paul Revere and include Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, James Bowdoin, and other figures.
“It’s essential to remember that the orrery is not just a model,” Associate Faculty Director of CHSI Hannah Marcus explains. “It’s a philosophically rich object that was meant to further a particular understanding of the universe.” While someone cranks the orrery to spur the model into motion, observers are moved to wonder who or what turns the “crank” of the universe.
As Ketchen and Schechner work on reassembly, the duo fall into near silence when placing the final screws, listening carefully to their every movement. After ensuring everything is secure, it is moved from a workshop on the second floor to its home on the first floor of the Putnam Gallery. It takes four movers to shift the main contraption from a table to a cart, through two pairs of doors, down a freight elevator, and finally into the Putnam Gallery to be reunited with its other pieces.
The Grand Orrery had to be turned on its side to fit through a door frame before being transported down a freight elevator and into the Putnam Gallery for display.
Ketchen has worked on countless clocks and instruments for the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments over the course of 30 years, but he notes that the Grand Orrery is special due to its size, history, and resilience.
“It went through a fire in Boston. It went through the Revolutionary War, Redcoats marching around, and who knows what they were doing with objects like this,” he explains.
“I’m glad that Harvard will take the time to keep these things up pretty much forever,” Ketchen says with a grin.
“Or we would like to think pretty much forever. Until the universe implodes, I suppose.”

Ask anyone who’s met me: I’ve never been punctual in my life.
If the event starts at 8, I’m getting in the shower at 7:45. During freshman year, I discovered that my friends had all made a secret group chat in which they conspired to tell me to show up to events half an hour early. I’ve been known to Uber to class from the Quad in moments of especially poor time management. I show up late to dinner, late to section, late to my own birthday party three years in a row. Time, to me, is a living, pulsing companion — less a friend than an unshakeable stalker, a figure waiting for me in an alleyway, ready to ambush.
My inability to wrangle time has always been hard to explain. Every pop-psychology article on overcoming procrastination, lovingly forwarded by my father, seems to miss the point. I’ve kept a more or less meticulous weekly planner since elementary school. I’m a religious Google Calendar scheduler. An ever-present tan line on my left wrist marks the watch I wear every day. If I were less organized or more careless, my chronic lateness might feel more forgivable. But I know exactly where all the time is going. I just can’t help watching it tick by.
***
This year, as the hourglass of my senior spring rapidly sifts out, I’ve started to run out of time in a far more sinister way.
At a school where nearly 60 percent of seniors go into finance, consulting, or tech after graduation — and still more head straight to graduate school — it might not be surprising that every single one of my close friends already knows what they’ll be doing come fall. As a junior with no desire to do any of the above, it didn’t seem so bad, at first, to not have things figured out. Being directionless was whimsical, even freeing and fun. But as junior year turned to summer, fall, and spring, my complete and utter lack of plans began to look (and feel) somewhat less hilarious.
Within my social circle, my lack of career prospects has made me a sort of curious oddity at best and a cause for deep concern at worst. My blockmates joke that my term-time job as a barista at Cabot Café will come in handy after graduation, and at this point, I don’t think they’re entirely unserious. Meals with well-meaning friends frequently turn into Office-of-Career-Services-style brainstorming sessions.
Even worse, during the past couple months, my friends have given up on the subject entirely, tactfully avoiding the elephant in the room as though any mention of my unemployment might trigger a breakdown. I appreciate the urge to help, of course. But it’s hard to remain calm and self-assured, to treat my lack of direction as a harmless detour, when my friends have become overnight crisis counselors. I feel like I’ve misdiagnosed something fatal: What I thought was a seasonal flu looks, to everyone else, like the bubonic plague.
I didn’t used to be like this. I used to be ahead of the curve. I had grand ambitions to be a writer, or a politician, or a high-powered lawyer. My high school teachers affectionately promised I would lead a country some day, and I agreed (If nothing else, I’ve become far less insufferable than I was at 16). But somehow, in the same Harvard pipeline that produced my McKinsey-bound friends, I took a hard left. I spent my summers at home with my family or at random odd jobs with little relevance to a future career or, once, in the middle of rural Vermont, while my peers moved on to research programs and prestigious internships in New York City.
Certain paths at Harvard seem clear-cut and signposted: the route to being a lawyer, or a project manager at Google, or, yeah, a consultant. I rejected those paths early on, instinctively, certain I had some other, mysterious thing to contribute to the world. Now, at the precipice of my graduation, I find myself staring headlong into an amorphous black pit where my future should be.
So far, I’ve floated passively along the current of my life: After middle school came high school, then college, junctures I had no real choice in approaching. Now, at the first unguided fork in the road, I’ve faltered, paralyzed by the grave task of shaping my own life.
***
I lied. I know exactly why I’m always late. In the hours I should have spent writing papers and applying for jobs, I actually figured it out.
If I start studying for an exam the night before, I’m freed from the specter of excellence and my own crippling expectations. I don’t have to ace it; I just have to pass. Running 15 minutes late to an event pumps my adrenaline just enough to shut off that part of my brain that worries I won’t be charming or social or well-dressed. Running out the clock, I’ve realized, liberates me from the burden of perfection.
Deciding who I’ll be in a few months with the cocoon of Harvard College stripped away, what the first tentative shell of my adult self might look like, feels infinitely more high-stakes than any assignment or formal. Almost involuntarily, I’ve retreated to the coping mechanism I know best. The longer I avoid making decisions, the lower the self-imposed pressure to make the right ones. The less time I have to choose a job, the more I can ignore the blaring alarm bells reminding me how badly I might screw this up.
But ironically, my stalling tactics, rather than narrowing down the world to a set of manageable options, have laid my future terrifyingly, miraculously wide open. I missed the boat for recruiting and grad school applications — the careers I once fled to as a safe haven when adults asked about my post-college plans — escaping from the tyranny of my teenaged self and all her misguided notions of what might make me happy and safe and secure. Paralyzed by my fear of imperfection, of choosing wrong, I’ve inadvertently made the perfect path impossible. Now there’s nothing left to do but forge my own path.

I’ve realized over the years that there are some truly serendipitous blessings that come with running late. I miss the train and take an Uber, and my driver, like a prophet, says exactly what I needed to hear that day. I obligingly stop to take photos for tourists in the Yard, sacrificing arriving on time to lecture in favor of a conversation that reminds me how lucky I am to be here in the first place. And by procrastinating my own future, I’ve saved myself from making the most fatal mistake: embarking on adulthood without really considering what I want from it, what’s good for me, what I’m called to do.
One night last October, I hurried down the cobblestones of Lansdowne St. to meet up with my friends. I was running late. Above me, Fenway Park’s green awnings and the neon signs of the bars loomed, blurred out slightly by the homemade vodka concoction I’d just chugged to pregame. I was on my way to make a big mistake, but I didn’t know it yet. (I am, as I write this, surely on my way to making several big mistakes, though I cannot see them yet.) It was raining. Was it raining? I was so giddy, teetering along on too-high heels, frantically texting the group chat that I was approaching, that I wouldn’t have noticed one way or another.
When I passed the flashbulb sign of House of Blues, a tinny wave of music stopped me in my tracks before I recognized what I was hearing: “Landslide,” the Fleetwood Mac version, the mournful soundtrack to my every disappointment, every heartbreak, every moment of intense weakness for the past three years. It was 9:50, and my friends had been at the bar since 9. But for a minute, I stood still in front of the concert hall’s wide-open doors and let the song wash over me, let myself forget the passing seconds, let myself believe I had been divinely preordained to stand here and listen to Stevie Nicks’ gentle warning, just as late as I needed to be, at exactly the right time.

The following is a transcript from Cookie Monster’s recent guest lecture at the Harvard Business School. Like Kim K., he also wore his finest pinstriped pantsuit, black leather trench coat, and (though not for public viewing) SKIMS undergarments. Unlike Kim K., Mr. Monster opted to perform his speech to the tune of his smash hit, “C is for Cookie.”
Now what starts with the letter C? Cookie starts with C. Oh, Harvard Business School, I’m sure you can think of other things that start with the letter C.
♫
C is for Career: It’s the reason all of you are here!
You want to climb corporate ladders and break glass ceilings,
Only if, in your pockets, billions appear.
Listen close; my intention is not to hurt your feelings.

C is for Capitalism:
Your favorite economic system
It made your clothes and the pens you use to write
And of course, who wouldn’t want Cheetos-flavored Sprite?
C is for Compete:
It’s the name of this capitalist game
You’re here training to be the winners
Because the winner takes it all
And the loser goes unnamed.
Remember how C stands for Cookie?
You’re the Business School, so it’s okay if I have to remind.
Well, take any corporation that, say, sells cookies,
And you’ll find exploitation baked inside.
Say you can bake 40 cookies in an hour
And they sell for a buck a piece
You set the oven, melted the butter, perfectly measured the flour
But because I am your boss, I give you $15 for the labor that I lease.
Not one of those cookies would exist without you,
But I, who performed no productive labor,
Will pocket the remaining $25, the surplus value.
I’ll spend it exactly how I like — thanks, my little baker!
C is for Counterargument:
“But the capitalist takes all the risk!” you say.
“It is very difficult to open a bakery in today’s day and age.”
Is that sufficient reason to pocket someone else’s pay?
There is a power imbalance inherent in the system of the wage.
A capitalist opens a business and risks losing it.
A worker takes a job and risks their autonomy — to someone else they must submit.
A capitalist loses their business and risks becoming a worker.
A worker loses their job and risks their life being thrown into disorder.
C is also for Commodification:
In capitalism, everything is for sale
Would you like to eat, breathe, live?
Get some money, place it on their golden scale.
Dear HBS, I hope my uncouthness, you’ll forgive.
See, even in this country with its abundant(ly misplaced) fortune
The number of states where you can work for minimum wage, full-time,
And afford a two-bedroom apartment is none, as of 2021.
Meanwhile the U.S. spends millions treating homelessness as a crime.
A surprise medical bill will cost you an arm, a leg, and your life.
As many as nine million American children went to bed hungry last night.
It’s no surprise that the U.S. is a site of such political strife,
When your net worth is the only thing that makes life a right.
C is for conflict
C is also for class
C is for class conflict
(Perhaps, at this point, it seems I’m reading straight from Das Kapital
But don’t dismiss me as a freedom-hating, Stalin-loving radical.)
If democracy is rule by the many,
But the needs of the many aren’t secure,
Something must be going amiss in a land with such plenty, —
Catering only to the interests of the entrepreneur.
Take, for example, C is for the CIA
(That C also stands for colonialism):
If a socialist leader in South America is elected with a resounding yay,
We simply must overthrow them– in the name of preventing despotism!
As an added plus, we keep taking their national resources — no one is in the way.
The corporate world lobbies for pipelines destroying Indigenous land
They manufacture missiles and demand a war to match
They say “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” and take tax cuts from Uncle Sam’s hand
The world’s nearly in ecological collapse, and they’re still looking for profit to snatch.
C is for Change:
Change that’s good enough for us all
Change is always possible
No matter how big or how small
Before capitalism, feudalism was the mode of production.
Perhaps if you went back in time and asked a serf,
They never would’ve imagined feudalism’s destruction.
There was a system before capitalism and there will be one after
We can either ride the wave until into destruction and fascism we descend
Or the people, the working class, can become their own master.
C is for Collaboration:
Because human nature is not inherently one of deceit
Scientific innovations, orgies, disaster relief:
Society’s at its best when we collaborate, not compete.
C is for Collectivize:
Because why should Sidechat be democratic but not your workplace
Workers should have democratic control of the enterprise
They will keep the operation running while solving problems majorities face.
Workers would decide how to use the value of what they produce there,
And we’d see society decenter profit to prioritize community care.
If all vital products are accessible and free,
What need does anyone have to charge you for a single cookie?
Let’s give a title to this ideology of which I speak
It also starts with a C — the letter for which I am such a geek.
Drumroll, please… Cookieism is its name!
You all look a bit surprised — perhaps there’s a different C-word my ideas could claim.
The world is so big and so round
The world is a cookie
And if you dig so deep and so far into the ground
You will only find more cookie
If you take only one thing away from today,
We can all have a piece of the cookie: this is what I’ve attempted to convey.
Thank you for your time, I will take no questions, now I must dip–
It’s time for Cookie Monster’s afternoon chocolate chip.

Gravi strutted around in the flock of other turkeys, ruffling his tail feathers and wagging his crimson snood. None of the passersby seemed to take notice as they walked to their morning classes. Regardless, his whole performance was a sham — he wasn’t here for mating. While the other male turkeys strutted around in desperation, hoping to woo a group of females across the sidewalk, he peered from the side of his floppy snood at the faces of nearby students.
His target was Annie, a sophomore who, on Wednesday mornings, always races, Peet’s Coffee in hand, to her Econ 1010b lecture in the Science Center. He just needed to keep up the mating act a bit longer. There was no way these humans could differentiate one brown gobbler from another. The curators in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, maybe, but it wasn’t like they ever signed up for the Assassin games, where competitors race to eliminate their targets by touching them with a spoon. And besides, their dusty and half-rotten specimens were almost surely out of sync with the latest in fowl fashion. He spread his tail fan a bit more, waiting for Annie to appear.
There. From across the Science Center Plaza, he saw her — running per usual to the Science Center. He took a few steps in her direction, facing away but keeping her in his peripheral vision the whole time. That’s the advantage of evolving as a prey species over years of November Slaughters, he supposes. Nothing gets past those beady eyes.
Annie was closer now, slowing down as she neared the revolving doors. As she approached, she pulled out her phone. It was almost too easy.
In one powerful swoop, Gravi soared into the air, rapidly closing the distance with a few powerful beats of his wings, clutching a plastic spoon in his talons. As he soared over the distracted human, he tapped her lightly on the shoulder. Gotcha!
“That’s just fowl!” Annie exclaimed as Gravi landed. He cocked his head to one side and looked at her expectantly. She rolled her eyes, letting out an incredulous sigh.
“I still can’t believe I got tagged out by a bird—”
He gave an impatient cluck.
“Fine! My target’s Remy — good luck catching him, buddy. He’ll eat you alive.”
Gravi ignored her mocking tone. Though not as bad as humans, cats had definitely murdered their fair share of his bird brethren over the years. He ruffled his wings, giving a satisfied gobble. Time to go on the hunt again.
Armed with this new information, Gravi paced the Science Center Plaza, formulating a plan of attack. He knew where he could find Remy — at the Barker Center — but that cat was practically untouchable while surrounded by his human acolytes.
He made his way through the Yard, reveling in every opportunity to startle the occasional tourist going about their day. After the 0.4 mile trek, he assumed his position hidden by the Yard gate near Lamont, staking out the entrance to Remy’s favorite hideout.
Gravi stood there for hours. Like most assassin players, the game had become his life; he was willing to do anything, even if it meant approaching his natural predator alone.
***
Remy the Harvard cat was having quite the day. When he made his usual trip to Barker, this time he was faced with catastrophe: there was no one there to open the door. Glumly, Remy dragged his paws to Lamont Library across the street, distracting students who always seemed to be free despite claiming to be “grinding.”
After a long day of getting pampered and photographed, he decided it was time for a quick bite. When he stepped outside, his whiskers perked up at what he saw: an unsuspecting turkey by the Lamont gate, who for some reason that Remy couldn’t fathom, was fixated on something across the street.
A few minutes later, Remy was licking his lips, picturing the next post on Khuranagram; he could already see the caption: “Saw our friend, Remy, walking through sunny Harvard Yard. Let us all learn from him, spreading love and peace throughout our community.”
***
Later that evening, as he trotted over to the Science Center for his nightly Cabot excursion, Remy felt an unusual hairball come up. Spitting it out, he examined it closely and gasped as a spoon came into focus. Shit.

Xinyu Chen, a professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, discussed the current state and future of China’s carbon neutral transition in a virtual lecture Wednesday morning.
Chen’s lecture was a part of a research seminar through the Harvard-China Project — where he is a research fellow studying renewable energy and power systems — and focused on the challenges posed by China’s efforts to transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy use.
Chen began the lecture with a question regarding whether the Chinese government’s policy could facilitate a transition to renewable energy.
“Is there a policy sufficiency problem — meaning that if the power market reform can fully support the transition and can fully incentivize the transition or not?” Chen said. “That’s the thing. That is a really open topic for everyone in China now.”
To answer this question, Chen described how China’s current energy market structure has led to an energy crisis in the nation.
“The strict carbon reduction policy and also the regulated power sector pricing led to a very severe shortage in electricity that started from 2021,” Chen said.
According to Chen, cities in China — especially those along the Yangtze River like Shanghai — continued to experience power shortages in 2022.
Chen also addressed China’s plans to increase renewable energy use in the future through investment, solar generation, and storage as a part of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, an initiative to drive economic and social development.
Chen highlighted the investments provincial governments have made for the “carbon neutral transition.”
“Aggregating all the provincial investment plans so that in the five year plan to investment is all already exceeding the 1200 gigawatt commitment by President Xi, so this is the pace that is picked up from the local governments,” Chen said.
When asked an audience question about the weaknesses in China’s renewable energy plan, Chen said he believes “ the Chinese government plan is going towards a really good direction.”
“I think the offshore wind plan actually needs more adjustments and we have a paper coming out pretty soon,” he added.
In an interview following the event, Chen commented on the policies needed most to create a sustainable energy market in China.
“I think the first things for the power market reform, we need a market system — not a single market — there’s a market system with a wholesale market capacity market, retail market and the renewable policies, all implemented together to really make it work,” Chen said. “And without any piece, the market will not function as desired.”
Chen also reflected on his time working with the Harvard-China Project .
“It actually is a really fascinating journey and we have been working at Harvard-China Project for many, many years,” he said. “And along the way, a lot of original research has been conducted, and I think some of the research is really impactful in the Chinese government.”

Harvard College’s Dean of Students Office has proposed a temporary pause on the creation of new student organizations, citing limited resources to accommodate the needs of existing clubs.
According to the co-presidents of the Harvard Undergraduate Association, administrators from the DSO suggested the move at an April meeting of the Committee on Student Life, an advisory panel at the College composed of administrators, faculty deans, and undergraduates.
Associate Dean for Student Engagement Jason R. Meier said in a Wednesday interview that the pause would seek to address the imbalance between the volume of student organizations and the resources available to support them.
The DSO oversees more than 500 existing student organizations and has received between 80 and 100 applications for new organizations annually, a number that has increased over the past two years, according to Meier.
“Reality is, the resources that we have in terms of space, finances, membership, and advising is not keeping pace with the amount of organizations that we have,” he said.
Meier said a pause would allow the DSO a chance to “stop the pile-on so that we can strategically think about how to properly manage the system.”
Alongside limited resources, Meier said the number of student organizations has created redundancy in clubs and made it difficult for some groups to recruit new members.
“If every student makes their own student org, who’s a member of that student org?” he said. “We really need to take a pause to really rethink what this process is to make sure that we're setting our student orgs up for success.”
Meier said the DSO is “benchmarking” its student organization ecosystem with other peer institutions, adding that those schools manage fewer clubs and only approve around 20 annually. Despite the proposed pause, the DSO is not looking to limit or reduce the number of student organizations in the long term.
“It would be against everything we stand for to tell an org, ‘You can’t exist anymore,’” he said.
The proposed pause would be the latest in a series of moves by the DSO to increase regulation of independent student organizations.
In recent months, the DSO has renewed efforts to restrict branding by student organizations, with a focus on groups’ use of the Harvard name. Meier said in an April interview that the DSO also plans to conduct an audit of independent student organizations in conjunction with Harvard’s Office of Risk Management, but he said Wednesday that the proposed pause is unrelated to the audit.
HUA Co-President John S. Cooke ’25 said he and Co-President Shikoh Misu Hirabayashi ’24 have spoken “vehemently against” the proposal.
“We were completely against it because obviously student organizations — and starting student orgs — are a big part of student life here,” Cooke said.
Hirabayashi called a freeze on creating new clubs “too extreme,” but he acknowledged the resource constraints faced by the DSO.
“It is somewhat true that there are a lot of clubs and there are limited finances,” he said.
Cooke added that it would be “valuable” for students to offer feedback on whether they support or oppose the proposal directly to the DSO, adding that he and Hirabayashi can only do so much as co-presidents to convey student opinion.
Meier said he is “always happy to take critical feedback” and that he appreciates the co-presidents’ suggestions.
Meier declined to comment on the likelihood of a club creation freeze, but he said the DSO is soliciting feedback from students about the proposal.
“We’re also being really realistic about, ‘What can the ecosystem withstand?’ Because at some point, if it continues to grow at this rate, that system will break,” he said.

The Harvard Kennedy School received more than $15 million to fund an expansion of the Harvard Project on Indigenous Governance and Development, the school announced in a Tuesday press release.
The gifts will fund a new professorship, a senior fellowship, and programming initiatives, according to the press release. The donation announcement coincides with the renaming of the project — originally called the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development — to better reflect its mission.
The donors include the Endeavor Foundation, the Chickasaw Nation, HKS professor emeritus Joseph P. Kalt and his wife Judith K. Gans, the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, and members of the Circle of Supporters, the project’s advisory group.
“The generosity of our donors allows us to strengthen and expand our work with Native communities in meaningful ways, and we are grateful for this support,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in the press release.
The donation from the Endeavor Foundation will endow the new Julie Johnson Kidd Professorship in Indigenous Governance and Development, according to project Senior Director Megan Minoka Hill.
The position will be awarded to a scholar in the field of Indigenous nation-building who will lead the project going forward. Hill expects the nationwide search and administrative processes to take about a year.
“These research think tanks at universities, including Harvard, don’t really survive without a tenured professor,” Hill said. “So this is really a key piece to the sustainability of our work going forward.”
The Chickasaw Nation endowed the Ittapila Program for Nation Building Education and Outreach — named for the word “ittapila,” meaning “to help one another” in the Chickasaw language — which will focus on offering summer fellowships and grants to students working directly with Indigenous nations among other student engagement initiatives.
Kalt and Gans’ donation will fund the creation of the Senior Fellowship for Indigenous Governance and Development, which aims to bring together students and national leaders on Indigenous affairs.
“It’s such an important moment in the history of the Kennedy School and Harvard University to commit itself to Indigenous governance,” Hill said. “The Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University will always have a focus on Indigenous eminence and there is nowhere else that I know of that has made that same commitment”
While Kennedy School Native American and Public Service Fellow Vic Hogg came to HKS because of the project’s abundant resources, they said the school lacks Native American representation in its student body.
“I just really hope that now that we have the resources, even more resources than we had before — we have all these amazing things that are coming down the pipe — that the admissions office follows suit, and prioritizes recruiting Native and Indigenous students,” Hogg said.
Hogg added that they believe the donations will make a positive difference in Indigenous studies at Harvard and beyond.
“This will be a huge game changer and it’ll make a lot of impact in Indian Country broadly,” they said. “It’s a big deal when an institution like Harvard says that a topic like this means enough and matters enough that $15 million should be allocated towards it.”
“It gives me a lot of hope,” they added.
Correction: April 20, 2023
A previous version of this article misspelled the name of HKS professor emeritus Joseph P. Kalt.

Radcliffe Fellow Omer Aziz, a lawyer and the former foreign policy adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, discussed fascism in America at a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies presentation Wednesday.
While attending law school and as a writer, Aziz has researched the history of fascism through a historical, legal, and sociological lens. He is currently writing an essay collection that examines fascism in the modern-day U.S., inspired by political scientist and philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville’s book “Democracy in America.”
Aziz began his talk by defining fascism as an “aggressively nationalistic, anti-democratic” form of government.
“It embodies and glorifies the traditionally masculine, it has a great nostalgia for the past, and it exercises a certain war over culture,” Aziz said. “But in practice, fascism leads to the marginalization and the demonization of an other, always.”
Though fascism is most often associated with 20th-century movements like Nazism, Aziz said its roots lie in slavery and white supremacy.
“Fascism was not just in the recent past of the West. It was practically tradition,” he said.
Aziz’s research focuses on the “core tension” between American conceptions of equality and the discrimination written into U.S. law.
“‘All citizens are equal before the law’ is a famous passage that’s quoted often in law school. I view it as an aspirational statement,” he said.
Many Nazi policies were heavily inspired by racist American laws, according to Aziz. Jim Crow laws, racial restrictions on immigration, and U.S. policies toward Native Americans formed much of the groundwork for fascist legislation like the Nuremberg Laws, he added.
Some American race laws were even believed to be too extreme within Nazi Germany.
“The Nazis actually thought American law around the one-drop rule and other forms of segregation was actually too harsh,” Aziz said.
Aziz said he believes America must be more critical of its own history and complicity in racist policies.
“The common narrative is that America went into Europe and saved Europe from Nazism and fascism, which is totally false,” he said. “The original Constitution had white supremacy written right into it, and the Nazis understood this.”
Aziz said Harvard also has a history of complicity with 20th-century fascist movements, citing an instance in 1934 when the Harvard Class of 1909 welcomed an alumnus who was a Nazi official to campus.
“Ernest Hanfstaengl, the Nazi official, came to campus and had tea with Harvard’s president,” Aziz said.
Aziz said extremist fascist ideology continues to have a modern-day presence, noting that Cambridge saw members of a neo-Nazi group harass students and local residents last November.
“Neo-Nazis were here, assaulting, attacking students, shouting slurs,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is not theory. These people didn’t go away.”
Modern-day fascists are “unified by their love of violence or hatred of progress and the sinister sense of entitlement that America belongs to them,” Aziz said.
“I don’t believe that we are destined to end up in a fascist country or fascist regime. But I do think right now we’re living in a pivotal moment where it could go either way,” he added.

Health policy researcher Jessica A. Williams discussed how to prioritize health and wellbeing among low-wage health care workers in a Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies talk Wednesday afternoon.
The event was part of the School of Public Health’s Population Research Exchange program, a lecture series in which faculty members share their work on population science research in weekly seminars, workshops, and information sessions.
Williams, an associate professor of health policy and administration at Pennsylvania State University, focused her seminar on the effects of leadership commitment to the workers’ health and safety.
“The most interesting question to me, obviously, is whether or not people actually felt like this was reflected in the actions of the company,” she said of companies’ health and safety policies.
To answer this question, Williams examined the correlation between worker turnover at nursing homes and the degree to which facility leadership formally committed themselves to worker health and safety. Williams assigned each nursing home a “leadership score” based on this level of commitment.
“What we saw was that for nurses — so folks with an RN degree — nursing homes with low leadership had higher turnover than nursing homes with better leadership,” Williams said.
Even after controlling for several factors that could have influenced these findings — like bed count, the percent of residents on Medicaid, rural counties, county-level turnover, and staffing hours per patient — Williams found the same result.
“For places with above median leadership, they had lower turnover rates than places that had below median leadership, even after controlling for all of these other factors,” she said.
Williams said the study’s findings had wide confidence intervals, adding that “we might see something a little bit different” with a larger sample.
Later in the seminar, Williams explored the relationship between leadership commitment to worker health and safety and Covid-19 prevalence.
“We really saw that better leadership for workplace health and safety led to fewer resident cases, and a pretty big difference,” she said. According to Williams, leadership performing in the top 75th percentile led to only 19 cases, while worse leadership — in the bottom 25th percentile — led to around 44 cases.
To assess workplace health and safety in the scope of Covid-19 cases and pandemics generally, Williams also examined employee participation and collaboration, looking at “whether different groups in the organization collaborate on workplace health and safety across their different departments.”
Williams then transitioned into policy, highlighting reforms by the Biden administration to “improve quality and safety of these nursing facilities, protect residents and those who care for them.”
Addressing the scarcity of health care workers, Williams said “it’s a low-wage industry, but it has a lot of high turnover and difficulty attracting people because it’s low-wage.”
While other industries respond by raising wages, Williams said “nursing homes don’t seem to do that as well as other places,” due in part to their financial structure as well as “historically entrenched thoughts” about appropriate wages.
In looking toward the future, Williams asked attendees how conditions might be improved.
“We know the working environment in a lot of nursing homes is not good. It’s much worse since Covid-19,” Williams said. “And so what are people who run the nursing homes actually willing to do?”

Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator and first-ever White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy discussed President Joe Biden’s climate policies and obstacles to further legislation during a Wednesday lecture.
McCarthy — who was joined by James H. Stock, the University’s vice provost for climate and sustainability and a professor of political economy — delivered the Warren and Anita Manshel Lecture in American Foreign Policy.
More than 50 people attended McCarthy’s talk, which was co-sponsored by the Office of Sustainability and Climate and the Weatherhead Research Cluster on Climate Change and hosted in Smith Campus Center.
McCarthy opened her lecture with praise for the Biden administration’s stance on climate change.
“After 20 years of local and state efforts that I have participated in to try new ideas, new policies, things to think about, strategies, Joe Biden knew the solution — that we needed to make any progress on climate fast — was already there for us to grab,” she said. “He was simply fearless in making his position clear and driving that change at every opportunity that he had available.”
McCarthy then explained the “pillars” of President Biden’s policies, which she said include creating millions of jobs and reducing Americans’ energy bills. These plans, she said, persuaded her to leave her position as CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy organization.
“I just couldn’t say no, because I knew that it would provide an opportunity for us to actually elevate this issue in a way that would immediately get our country excited, especially to young people that have been fighting so hard,” McCarthy said.
McCarthy said she believes she saw this opportunity when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act last summer. Under the legislation, the federal government will invest hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years to reduce the cost of renewable energy.
“I’m really proud of the work that got done,” McCarthy said, listing other recent climate legislation. “That is what is going to actually drive us towards a cleaner and healthier future for American workers and for their families.”
McCarthy emphasized the importance of the U.S.’ role in addressing global climate change.
“This is good, but our future is still at stake. And we have to work every single day, make all the money, and work with companies all across the globe so that everybody can see that there is an opportunity for them,” she said.
Following the lecture, McCarthy entered into discussion with Stock.
McCarthy first responded to a question about the pushback that may come with increasing regulation on coal production from the Supreme Court and Congress.
“If we make our decisions based on this Supreme Court, we will do absolutely nothing,” she said.
McCarthy also expressed disappointment with the Biden administration’s failure to limit drilling on federal land.
“Look, we are dealing with laws that are 100 years old; they are irrelevant today,” she said. “The courts are not going to be friendly to any change in the status quo.”
McCarthy said the Supreme Court’s inaction explains why the administration has focused so heavily on the private sector and demand side.
“If our clean energy strategies can compete effectively against fossil fuels, that’s where the soft underbelly of change has to live,” she said.
Stock also asked McCarthy what Harvard can do to contribute to sustainability.
“I am a big believer in divestment, pure and simple,” McCarthy said.
She added that Harvard should also attempt to purchase goods for University operations carefully and maximize energy efficiency.
McCarthy concluded by emphasizing the unique role students play in the sustainability movement.
“I honestly don’t know anyone in Washington, anyone in the White House, that does not believe that the young people are the driver of change,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For more than 45 years, the Bow & Arrow Press — a student-run letterpress studio founded in 1978 — has quietly resided in the basement of one of Harvard’s undergraduate residences, Adams House, serving as a gathering place and creative venue for Harvard students and alumni.
But as the House continues its ongoing renovations, Adams Faculty Deans Mercedes C. Becerra ’91 and Salmaan A. Keshavjee informed Press manager Heather Hughes, a House non-resident tutor, on Monday via email that the studio’s location in the basement of Westmorly Court’s B-entryway will become a common room following completion of the building’s renewal in 2025.
Becerra and Keshavjee wrote the email, obtained by The Crimson, in response to a message by Jeffrey E. Seifert ’81, a former Crimson editor, asking to keep the Press in Adams House following renovations. Hughes and Adams non-resident tutor Jonathan L. Biderman, who also manages the Press, said the message contradicted assurances given during a 2019 meeting with House Renewal architects and Project team members that the studio would remain in Adams after renovations are completed.
The message was repeated in another meeting with the same group of architects and team members late last year, according to Hughes, in which they discussed the temporary storage of Press supplies during renovation and presented floor plans for the renovated studio in the same location. But several months later, plans for the Press have taken a different direction.
“The plan, which has been in place for years, has been walked back without any community involvement either from Adams residents or from the Bow and Arrow community,” Hughes said in an interview at the 45th-anniversary celebration of the Press, which took place this past weekend.
The move will require the storage and maintenance of the historic printing materials — including a Vandercook printing press, a manual printing press from 1914, a Chandler & Price tabletop printing press from mid- to late-1800s, and more than 1,000 printing blocks — prior to the start of Westmorly renovations.
While Press supplies remain in storage, many campus programs — including workshops, introductory courses, and weekly Open Press nights — which use the studio will be temporarily paused.
Andrew S. Birsh ’78, who helped found the press in 1978, described the press and these programs as “a fusion place for creativity” and an “important creative outlet.”
“That’s part of the great value that the accessibility and openness of the press has,” Birsh said. “It provides an educational opportunity that most people didn’t even know they could receive.”
“The press’ history is pretty well known to the people who work there, and they do feel that they’re part of a developing process that should continue in the future,” Birsh added.”
Some Adams affiliates say they fear the move will change the reputationally “weird” nature of the House.
“I think it’s like a perfect place for Adams House,” Carly Braille ’26 said. “It’s the spirit of Adams: quirky, cool, old.”
Keshavjee, the Adams Faculty Dean, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the plan will not shut down the Press.
“In fact, our hope is for the Bow & Arrow Press to continue its operations at another site in the Harvard community,” Keshavjee wrote. “We are working with the Dean of the College, and through his office, various campus partners, to secure a new home for the Press.”
Hughes and Biderman, the Press managers, said they believe Adams residents should be included in conversations about the location of the studio following renovations.
“We have not been part of discussions happening about what is going to be the fate of the press going forward,” Hughes said.
“If it’s going to cease to exist then why not be open about it,” Biderman added. “Why not involve people in the conversation, and let them try to save it before it has disappeared?”
James J. Barondess ’79, who also helped found the press, said he hopes Harvard will “meaningfully support the press in the future.”
“A lot of people outside Harvard know and love to press,” he said. “I’d love to see that grow in some way and get cemented in a financially sustainable way.”
As the interview came to a close at the Press anniversary celebration, Hughes demonstrated the art of letterpress, placing a blank page into two metal teeth, sliding the long cylinders along the press, and producing a note that read “thank you.”
Then, rolling the Vandercook press back, she explained, “There are four things you have to have to do printmaking. You need the thing to print, you need ink, you need paper, and you need pressure.”
“Our fifth ingredient is remaining in our space and with our community,” Hughes said.

Roughly 70 Harvard affiliates gathered at Harvard Kennedy School Wednesday for a panel on modern-day lynching and racialized violence, centering around the 2018 death of William A. “Willie” Jones Jr.
HKS professor and former NAACP President Cornell William Brooks stressed during the talk that lynching remains a serious issue in the United States today. Brooks and HKS student Ayesha Islam moderated the panel, which featured guest speakers Jill C. Jefferson, the founder and president of civil rights organization JULIAN, and Ayana Jones, a JULIAN organizer.
A team of students in Brooks’ class — MLD-375: “Creating Justice in Real Time: Vision, Strategies, and Campaigns” — hosted the panel with support from the school’s William Monroe Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice.
Lynchings in the last century “numbered about 4,000 or so,” Brooks told attendees at the start of the event.
“These are the kinds of things that one might assume are relegated to the dustbin of history, buried in the bowels of the National Archives,” he said. “But the fact of the matter is that lynchings occurred, certainly all across this country — and I will make the case — continue to this very day.”
Jones, a 21-year-old Black man, was found dead outside the house of his white girlfriend’s family in Scott County, Mississippi, on Feb. 8, 2018.
While local police and the district attorney’s office ruled Jones’ death a suicide, Jefferson, an attorney for Jones’ family, said the death was a “clear case of lynching.” She pointed to suspicious circumstances surrounding Jones’ death, such as an arm injury he received while playing football that would have made it difficult for him to take his own life.
“Why was there grass in his hair if his head never touched the ground? How could he have committed suicide with his arm injury? What about the people who heard him screaming for his life before the cops came?” Jefferson said. “We have so much evidence, so much evidence, and the DA refuses to do anything about it.”
According to the Associated Press, Scott County District Attorney Steven Kilgore said in 2021 that he would not present the case to a grand jury with the same evidence, though he added that if new evidence were brought forward, he would be open to pursuing criminal charges.
“If we had a reason to reopen it, we would do it without hesitation,” Kilgore said. “As of now, we don’t have a reason to do that.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Brooks said the district attorney’s investigation into Jones’ case was “absolutely abysmal and incompetent” and called for “state and federal charges brought against the perpetrators of the crime.”
Kilgore, the district attorney, did not immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.
Jefferson said she first researched Jones’ case as a student at Harvard Law School in 2018. After becoming an attorney in Washington, she reached out to Jones’ family to take on the case pro bono. Jefferson said Jones’ death devastated the people of Scott County.
“This lynching tore that community apart,” she said. “People stopped coming out of their houses. They stopped talking to each other. The trust was broken.”
An independent investigation by the Bellinder Law Firm, Jefferson, and the People’s Advocacy Institute found evidence that contradicted the initial suicide ruling. In a civil suit, Judge Winston Kidd awarded Jones’ family more than $11 million.
Jefferson added that Jones’ mother, Tammie Townsend, has an “incredible spirit, but she has been broken in a million ways.” According to Jefferson, Townsend moved to Houston after her son died, where she “lost the last of what she had of her son” when a storage facility wrongfully sold her belongings.
“And you have to think about the fact that she knows these lynchers are free. These people are walking around free — they’re living their lives when her son can’t,” Jefferson said. “It shows the difference in what lives matter and what lives don’t.”
Ayana Jones, who is from Mississippi, said she would like to see not only justice for Jones’ family but also a healing of Scott County.
“Justice for me means community power,” she said, adding that she wishes for residents to regain trust within one another and for kids to be able to “play and not feel scared to be outside”
During the panel, Jefferson discussed the challenges she has faced as a Black female attorney in the South, adding that she believes sexism may have played a role in the lack of progress on the case.
“Women in this field are not just overlooked but held down,” Jefferson said, pointing to the oppression faced by civil rights activists Dorothy Height and Rosa Parks. “Pretty much all of the experts in civil rights are women, but nobody knows that.”
“If I had been, say, Ben Crump, if that had been my name — take away everything else I have accomplished, just put that name on me, and give me a different gender — then this case probably would have already had justice,” Jefferson added. “This case would have already been in national news a million times over.”
Brooks told the audience that Jones’ death fits into a larger pattern of violence against Black Americans.
“The lynching of Willie Jones is not morally exceptional, not historically aberrational, but in fact — in the context of American history — almost tragically regular and routine,” Brooks said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-five Harvard organizations co-signed a letter to administrators detailing a list of demands following the University’s response to a “swatting” attack that saw four Black undergraduates ordered out of their rooms at gunpoint by Harvard University Police Department officers earlier this month.
According to the letter, which was sent Wednesday, members of co-signatory organizations will stage a demonstration during Visitas — the College’s admitted students weekend — if the University does not respond to the demands by April 23. This year’s Visitas will take place from April 23 to April 24.
The letter follows a wave of student and alumni outrage following the April 3 swatting attack, which prompted at least five HUPD officers to enter the students’ Leverett House suite at approximately 4:15 a.m. with riot gear and assault rifles. The officers were responding to a false 911 call about an armed individual in the dormitory and later deemed the situation safe.
The letter, which was predominantly signed by Black student organizations, levies a series of criticisms of the University’s response to the attacks and makes five specific demands.
The letter calls for a University-wide statement recognizing the “significant racial impact” of the swatting, a “thorough investigation” by HUPD, increased transparency and accountability in campus policing, a “proactive” mental health response, and an in-person town hall with administrators.
“We condemn the University’s failure to, at large, protect its Black community’s emotional and physical wellbeing in the aftermath of such trauma,” the letter reads.
Harvard Undergraduate Black Community Leaders Co-Chair Brian A. Cromwell Jr. ’23, who helped write the letter, said the victims of the swatting were consulted throughout the drafting of the letter.
“I feel like this letter really brought a lot of aspects of all the Black Harvard community together,” Cromwell said Tuesday. “I think it kind of speaks to the demands and how really everyone feels like these are very reasonable and necessary things to be asked for.”
The letter also criticized an “inexcusable” delay in University communication after the incident. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay issued College-wide statements on the evening of April 5, roughly 66 hours after the swatting incident.
Ebony Joy Johnson — the president of the Black Graduate Student Alliance, which co-signed the letter — criticized the “administration’s failure to adequately address the swatting incident” in an emailed statement.
“It also does not sit well with my soul that there is silence around this incident. It is not acknowledged campus-wide and was only addressed at the college, leaving the broader Harvard community unaware of what actually took place on our campus grounds,” Johnson wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in a statement that the University takes its responsibility to campus safety and wellbeing “very seriously.”
“University leaders have expressed their concern over the deeply troubling nature of the swatting incident that occurred on April 3, and the fear and anxiety it has caused in our community,” Newton wrote.
Two of the letter’s demands specifically concern HUPD, criticizing a “lack of transparency” and calling on the University to “immediately require HUPD to make its protocols and police reports available to students directly involved in police incidents.”
In an emailed statement Wednesday, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote that the investigation into the swatting is still active.
“HUPD’s investigation into the April 3 swatting incident is ongoing, and we are continuing to engage with the FBI on the investigation. HUPD, along with the University and the College, is continuing to review both the incident and Harvard’s response to it,” he wrote.
Newton wrote that the University, College, and HUPD are working to “identify learnings that can be incorporated into the protocols that guide first responders, the University and our Schools when incidents like this happen.”
The letter also called for changes to the University’s mental health procedures around experiences of “racial trauma.”
“To help tend to the trauma they experienced from the swatting incident, the four Black students affected were forced to reach out to Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Service themselves in order to receive mental health support,” the letter reads.
“When the University is aware of incidents of racial trauma, particularly those inflicted by the University itself, CAMHS should be notified by the University with the student’s contact information so they are equipped to contact the students involved in a proactive and timely manner,” it adds.
Newton declined to comment on the letter’s claim that students sought support from CAMHS themselves when Harvard did not initially reach out.
In addition, the letter demanded a University-wide, in-person town hall with top Harvard leaders including President Lawrence S. Bacow, President-elect Claudine Gay, and Khurana.
Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman, a Ph.D. candidate at the Harvard Kennedy School, helped organize graduate students behind the statement.
“The letter really is to honor the victims’ experience and to ensure that what they experienced doesn’t happen again,” Opoku-Agyeman said.
“At bare minimum, the letter definitely asks for a conversation, and so we’ll see how that conversation unfolds,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite coming back from a three goal deficit to end the first half tied 5-5, a game that appeared to at first parallel the squad’s three-goal-down comeback against No. 4 Cornell, the Crimson squad was unable to pull off a second consecutive underdog victory, falling to the No. 18 Penn Quakers 15-9. Despite Harvard’s ability to even the score, the Quakers created a definitive four-goal lead in the third quarter that ultimately set the tone for the rest of play. The next two games against RV/No. 20 Princeton and RV/No. 19 Yale will be critical in determining Harvard’s fate in securing a place in the Ivy and NCAA Tournaments.
Play by both teams was markedly lower in caliber than in other games this season. Unforced errors were a hallmark of the game for both teams, and contributed to mistakes in the midfield clearing the ball, as well as technical mistakes on the attacking and defending ends. In the midfield both squads had trouble clearing the ball, with Penn going 18-23 and Harva43rd going 20-25. The Crimson’s ride, which has been a high point of play all season, contributed to Penn’s errors, but several times technical mistakes of sending too many men over or not recognizing the shot clock and running out of time to clear were the unnecessary culprits for both teams.
“I think that we are continuing to improve in a lot of respects, specifically in our six-on-six defense which was our strong point at Cornell,” senior SSDM Chase Yager noted. “But I think a lot of shortcomings in our middle of the field game, both in rides and clears with a handful of offsides and failed clears throughout the game, as well as shortcomings in our man-up and man-down play held us back this weekend.”
Defense has continued to be Harvard’s strong suit this season. Lockdown play by defenders like first-year Charlie Muller and sophomores Collin Bergstrom, Tommy Martinson and Martin Nelson, as well as SSDM/LSDM first-year Owen Guest, sophomores Andrew O’Berry and Ray Dearth, junior Greg Campisi, and Yager, has improved from game-to-game. Communication as well as the quickness in sending the slide and recovery has resulted in increased confidence in one-on-one defense, which has allowed Crimson defenders to take liberties and make off-ball plays.
Having this tight-knit unit is essential in slowing down and mitigating threats from other teams. However, an inability to win at the faceoff has translated into increased pressure on the defense and a greater number of opportunities for opponents on the offensive end. Winning possession outright at the faceoff X is not only essential for creating momentum, but for relieving the defense of having to shut down quick takes on fast plays. Harvard had its best performance at the faceoff, winning 13 of 27 – many of which were won in the scrum by first-year Matt Barraco, sophomore Andrew DeGennaro, or the wings.
On the offensive end, the Crimson’s play was rushed.. The offense is known for its ability to generate shots, but of the 46 taken, only 25 were on goal. Part of this was due to Penn’s ability to mitigate the Crimson’s outside shooting, which forced the attack to take subpar shots and force the ball into the middle, but it was also partially due to Harvard’s shot-selection, which saw players rush sets.
“We settled a little bit which gave their goalie confidence. Shot selection is something that we have been trying to focus on all year and it’s kind of come in waves – we’ve had some good games and some bad games – and today wasn’t one of our better performances,” noted senior captain and midfielder Nick Loring.
Giving Penn’s junior goalie Emmett Carroll confidence in the first quarter with these forced takes set the tone for the rest of play. Carroll stuffed 64% of the Crimson’s shots, many of which were easy stops, and this energy permeated into the rest of Penn’s defense.
“We got out-competed in this game. We had a little bit of fire under us in the Cornell game, and I don’t necessarily think we played with the same fire in us today,” Loring commented. “There were some good things to take away from this, but we’ve got to channel that energy again going into these next two games and we’ve got to get back on the horse.”
Looking towards the rest of the season, Harvard has two must-win games. The squad will travel to Princeton this weekend to face off against the Tigers, who were a dominant force early in the season. Princeton is touted for its shifty offense, which is quarterbacked by sophomore attacker Coulter Mackesy. 91 in white and orange will be a player to watch, and will be a tough matchup for the Crimson defense. The following weekend, Harvard will welcome Ancient Eight rival Yale to Jordan Field for the team’s last game of the season in a contest that might decide which team earns the fourth slot in the Ivy Tournament.
“Looking to Princeton, I think we need to just refocus on our fundamentals,” Yager stated. “We know how well we can play based on our performance against Cornell, so just executing the stuff that we practice throughout the week and playing into our strengths will be key for us moving forward. A couple of must-win games ahead of us so we have plenty motivating us for the rest of the season.”
The game against the Princeton Tigers will take place Saturday, April 22 at 1pm on Sherrerd Field in Princeton, NJ. The game will also be streamed live on ESPN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the historic Harvard-Yale clash ended with an emphatic Crimson victory in a game that did not disappoint. The Bulldogs and the Crimson both came into this matchup with five wins in their last six games, making this a pivotal match for both sides.
Saturday was a back and forth affair that left the two teams even after three quarters of play. However, the Crimson broke away in the fourth with an early goal by freshman midfielder Charlotte Hodgson and the go-ahead goal by leading goal-scorer Callie Hem to seal the deal at 10-9.
The game began with an energized Crimson attack led by sophomore midfielder Caroline Mullahy, who notched the first goal of the game as the start of a standout performance. Mullahy would go on to notch four assists to complement her goal and earn herself the honor of Ivy League Attacker of the Week. Junior goalkeeper Chloe Provenzano quickly stifled an explosive Yale attempt on goal shortly after Mullahy’s tally, keeping Yale off the scoreboard. However, an early yellow card to freshman Despina Giannakopoulous proved too much to keep Yale from tying the game and then taking a one-goal lead with five minutes left in the first quarter.
However, with crafty work from Mullahy and vision for the darting run of freshman Hannah Shiels, the Crimson tied the game 2-2 with just ten seconds left in the first quarter.
“‘Assisting’ is my favorite part of the game,” Mullahy emphasized. “You are working together as an offense and it is so exciting when it pays off and to see in that game that every single person was a contributor.”
The second quarter was a back-and-forth frenzy with goal-scoring leaders and junior attackers Riley Campbell and Callie Hem creating an attack that left this quarter tied 5-5. The Crimson started its second quarter with junior Maddie Barkate dashing through the Bulldog’s defense to make her mark on the scoresheet. She continued to battle for control off of the draw, displaying her versatility and excellent form this season.
The Bulldogs proved to be a threat defensively, with big saves by Yale’s sophomore goalkeeper Cami Donadio stopping multiple attempts by Shiels early in the quarter. Yale took the momentum from these plays and converted on two free position shots to put them in the lead by one with nine to go in the quarter. Not long after falling behind, the Crimson bounded back with great build up play, starting with senior captain and standout defenseman Shea Jenkins finding junior midfielder Charley Meier, who connected with Mullahy before a classic Hem finish. A goal for each side brought the score even at 5-5 into half.
Coach Devon Wills spoke to the level of connection and chemistry that built such a successful attack throughout the first half and continued for the full 60 minutes.
“Our transition game is something that we try to practice a lot and it is an area that we think can be a strength of ours in terms of our speed and vision that both Maddie Barkate and Caroline Mullahy have,” Wills stated.
“I think the attackers figured out their timing. It’s been nice to see the connection and presence of mind letting the play come to us rather than trying to rush it and finding the right opportunity, not necessarily the first opportunity,” Wills added.
The Crimson led the charge into the third quarter with a quick goal by Shiels. The lead was fleeting as the Yale offense scored two goals off of quick play and a free position shot. Mullahy notched one of her four assists on the game to find Hodgson, who quickly went to her left hand to tie the game 7-7. Provenzano denied two strong shots with under five minutes to go in the third quarter, keeping the score tied.
“Chloe [Provenzano] saved us a couple of times. She had some really key saves and rebound saves. I think she really stepped up and is someone that is always consistent that we can trust,” Wills stated.
The third period ended tied 8-8 with a goal by junior midfielder Illana Kofman, who is continuing her stellar form after her thrilling overtime game winner at Cornell the previous week. The momentum rolled with the Crimson into the final quarter, where the team banded together to pull off the win. According to Mullahy, it was the energy at the end of the third that was the turning point in the course of the game.
“Our team is really good with energy, so for us it was just maintaining that energy for the full 60 minutes. When it came to game time, it was about trusting what we know and what we practiced during the week. So heading into the game the nerves were high but we were super excited as a team. During the game, our energy was through the roof through all four quarters,” Mullahy emphasized.
The Crimson led straight out of the gates in the fourth quarter after taking advantage of an early yellow card called against Yale, with Hodgson tallying her 17th goal of the season. Callie Hem followed shortly after with her 36th goal of the season, which proved to be the game-winner.
In the fourth, the Crimson defense came up big, with defensive work by sophomore midfielder Grace Taylor working to earn a game-high of six ground balls. The Crimson kept the Bulldogs to one goal with stellar saves by Provenzano and ruthless defending, and Harvard held on for a 10-9 win.
“We played that game like we knew we were going to win –  all of our hard work paid off. These past two wins have given us the confidence and energy to go into the next two games. We know that we are capable of making it far,” Mullahy stated.
“Columbia is going to be huge, just like every Ivy League game. We need to win each game one at a time and next up is Columbia so that is all we have to focus on,” Wills concluded.
Next up, Harvard welcomes Columbia this weekend to Jordan Field at 2:00 p.m. It will be streamed on ESPN+.

Congratulations on your acceptance to Harvard! We know there’s so much information to take in about our wonderful institution, and it can be overwhelming. Well, we at Flyby, being the benevolent publication that we are, have decided to make things easier for you. Here are the top 10 things you need to know about Harvard.
10. The Lowell Bells can go off whenever, so be ready.
You never know when that resonant chime of doom will wake you from your slumber or stop you in the middle of a Zoom call. Be ready to be annoyed a lot.
9. Bring your professor’s book to class on the first day, just in case.
Sometimes they’ll sign it for you! Famous professors love to meet their fans.
8. Everybody takes paper notes.
At some schools, everybody gets out their laptop or iPad during class to take notes. We don’t do that here. The internet simply distracts from learning, which is, of course, the priority. And professors will dock participation points if you use technology. Invest in some good notebooks and pens.
7. Cutting through the Yard is cringe. 
In the Yard, you look like a silly little student going to your silly little freshman dorm. On the streets surrounding the Yard, you look like a sophisticated metropolitan. So avoid the paths in the Yard as much as possible. You want to be a²+b², not c².
6. Don’t touch Remy. He’s feral. 
Once, Remy (the campus cat) got in my dorm, and then I had to get a series of rabies shots from health services. Admire his orange fur from afar, but don’t you dare pet him.
5. You absolutely have to be on time for everything.
Nobody at Harvard is ever late, especially for extracurricular meetings. Things will start exactly on time, so you better be there.
4. Annenberg has the best food on campus.
Sometimes, upperclassmen will try to be nice and invite you to eat in the house dining halls. Don’t do it. Take advantage of Berg’s superior food while you can.
3. When it’s warm out, everyone goes swimming in the river!
We’re so lucky to have such a clean and refreshing body of water right here on campus. Make sure to pack a swimsuit, because when it’s hot in the dorms, we all follow the time-honored tradition of splashing around in the Charles.
2. Every time people say “Flyby,” they’re referring to us, the blog.
Yeah, the quick-service place under Annenberg is technically called “Fly By.” But nobody calls it that out loud. They’re talking about us, the most important publication on campus.
1. Sometimes, Harvard students like to mess with prefrosh. 
Especially me. Sorry! Hazing is illegal. I have to get my kicks where I can.
Anyway, welcome to Harvard, and remember, “veritas” means “gullible” in Latin!
Sections
Welcome to Harvard, Class of 2027! As you take your first few steps on campus, there's a lot awaiting you here, and it can honestly get very confusing very quickly. Here at Flyby, we offer you an important resource: our annual breakdown of Harvard lingo for the Class of 2027!
The Yard
Your one-stop shop for all things Harvard: the statue, freshman dorms, the President’s office, genetically-engineered grass and too many tourists.
The Houses
During their first year, students are randomly assigned to one of 12 upperclassman Houses, each equipped with a dining hall, gym, library, plenty of amenities and House spirit. But really, there’s no best house… (except for Mather ;))
The Quad
QUAAAAAAD.
Located in Radcliffe College’s former residential campus, the Quad is home to three Houses: Cabot, Currier, and Pfoho, and is known for its amazing food, spirit, and Housing Day videos.
The SEC
Harvard’s secret partnership with Meta to sequester the CS concentrators. Also has been called “The Cheese Grater” due to its exterior. In reality, the Science and Engineering Complex is home to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, as well as some really cool amenities (did someone say Peloton bikes?).
Dhall (dee-hall)
Short for dining hall. That’s pretty much it.
Berg
An affectionate nickname for Annenberg Hall, the freshman-only Harry Potter-esque dhall that you’ve seen in all the promotional materials. Get ready for some of the highest highs (fried chicken sandwiches) and the lowest lows (molasses ???? chicken) of your first-year dining experience.
Memorial Hall
The big brick and stained glass building that contains practically all you need: Annenberg Hall; Sanders Theatre, a site for performances like Cultural Rhythms and CS50; multiple classrooms on upper and lower levels; grab-and-go dining options; and the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub, a popular spot for trivia nights and wings.
HUDS (hudds)
Harvard University Dining Services. The 2023 HUDS revamp was an overhaul of the dining menus that showed just how little college students require to feel happiness.
Cabot Science Library vs. Cabot House
Cabot Science Library is a studying space within the big concrete-glass building in the Science Center Plaza and will be the site of many (many) late nights. Cabot House is 20 minutes away in the Quad. Read your emails carefully.
Entryway
Your first-year residential community which includes 20-30 freshmen in the same floor or area of the dorm.
Proctor
A graduate student or member of Harvard staff who is your live-in resource for all things Harvard, including emergencies, support, academic advice, and free food.
PAF (paff)
Short for Peer Advising Fellow, a PAF is an upperclassman who does not live with you but is a great resource for advice on classes, campus life, and extracurriculars.
Rakesh / Dean Khurana
Dean of the College and everyone’s favorite Instagram influencer / adopted dad. +10 if you can get on the ‘gram during Visitas.
Concentration
Our quirky little way of saying “major”.
Secondary field
Because we’re sometimes too quirky, this is how we say “minor”.
Double vs. joint
Both refer to studying two fields. Before Harvard approved double concentrations last year, joint concentrations were the only way to concentrate on two areas of study, culminating in a thesis that combines your two fields of choice. A double still allows you to study two fields but without the requirement of a thesis. It’s still new, we’re all figuring it out.
Pset (pee-set)
A pset, or problem set, is a collection of questions typically assigned by STEM classes that can take you anywhere from two hours to two weeks to complete.
1363216
Time outside of lecture to ask questions, get help on problem sets, and feedback on essays. If you take any math from Math M to 21B, we’ll be sure to see you in the Math Question Center (MQC) Sundays through Thursdays from 7:30-11 p.m.
TF / PSL / CA
TF: Teaching fellow. Usually a graduate student that will help teach the class or grade your coursework.PSL (peer study leader) and CAs (course assistants) are undergraduates who have previously taken the course and can help answer questions or clarify concepts
Canvas
Why reinvent the wheel when 2022 Ellen explained it so well? Canvas is the app that ruins your day when you find out your midterm scores have been released. Canvas is a central platform (both a website and a mobile app) where your instructor will post course-related documents including assignments and syllabi and where you turn in your homework (and find out how well you did on it).
Q Guide
With a more devout following than the Bible, the Q Guide publishes student rankings and evaluations of past and current courses. We took these classes so you… still have to, but at least you know what to expect going into it (and build your coping mechanisms now)!
The T
Our favorite-by-default transportation system. Extensive? Sort of. Functional? Sometimes. Cheap? Eh. At least it gets you where you need to go… usually.
Jefe’s vs Felipes
The age-old debate between two classic fast-casual Mexican establishments and the most-asked icebreaker question. If you’re stuck on what to order, we HIGHLY recommend the nachos from Felipe’s and the quesadillas from El Jefe’s.
Comp
Just when you thought applications were over… psych! Many (but not all!) extracurriculars have a process to join called “the comp”, which can stand for anything from “competitive” to “completion.” Don’t worry though; plenty of incredible extracurriculars have absolutely no barriers to entry!
Women’s Center
Located in the basement of Canaday, the Harvard College Women’s Center provides space and programming designed to explore gender and women’s issues and build community. Plus, there’s free tea!
Quoffice
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life, fondly dubbed “Quoffice”, is located in the lower level of Thayer and is a resource and community to celebrate and support LGBTQ+ students across campus.
Flyby vs Fly By
Flyby is us. We are Flyby, the blog of The Harvard Crimson. We are cool. So cool. Fly *SPACE* By is the grab-and-go lunch service provided under Annenberg Hall for those who only have 15 minutes to eat between classes. Flyby is for everyone <3.

If you’ve ever been on a Harvard tour, you’ve probably heard the tour guide refer to the John Harvard statue as “The Statue of 3 Lies.” (Bonus points to you if you know what these lies are). While Harvard is an exciting place to be, it also comes with its bulk of challenges to overcome and myths to debunk. Here, Flyby shares the real three lies of Harvard that we’ve learned over the course of our years here thus far.
Lie #1: You need to commit your whole heart and soul to one passion.
My friend says this all the time: “Normalize not having a passion.” As an incoming freshman, it’s okay to know what you want to study and have a four-year plan saved on your phone; it’s also just as okay to not have any idea whatsoever. The best part about Harvard is arguably the ability and opportunity to try new experiences that you probably wouldn’t have the chance to do so elsewhere. Want to take a random class in some obscure niche field? No time like the present! Not sure if you want to try a new extracurricular activity? Give it a try, you never know! And hey, so many students come to college intending to do one thing and then change their minds multiple times over the course of the next four years. No matter what you have planned — or don’t have planned — Harvard is a great place for you to pursue new adventures and explore new passions.
Lie #2: You’re definitely going to meet your best friends and soulmate in your freshman fall semester.
Freshman fall is an exciting but overwhelming time — you will be meeting new people every day, in classes and dhalls, at parties and events. You have probably heard from at least one upperclassman that they met their blocking group and person they are currently dating in their first week of college. For every person who says this, there is another who will say that they struggled to find their footing socially in freshman fall, and it took them a while to find their core group of friends. Remember that everyone’s experience is different, and focus on having a good time with your new peers. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself and on every interaction you have. Be open to meeting new people in new situations. It will work out, even if it at first doesn’t feel like it!
Lie #3: You’ll get to do everything you want to do at Harvard. 
Harvard offers incredible opportunities! From internships in Spain to clubs that host formals on islands and boats, there are things you can do at Harvard that you truly cannot do anywhere else. What they don’t tell you is that there are more things that you can sign up for — more clubs, more jobs, more courses — than you’ll ever be able to do during your short time in College. Don’t let this deter you from enrolling! Coming to Harvard will truly open the door to this excess of opportunities for the rest of your life. However, make sure you’re not too hard on yourself when you can’t join a hundred clubs in the first semester or go to the seven parties being thrown on a Saturday night.
Now that you know the truth, will you still say yes to Harvard? We hope so! Want to learn more about this school and all of its quirks and perks — read more articles on our Guide to Visitas feature as well as on the rest of the blog!
