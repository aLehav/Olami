After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those who have ever wanted a unique view of the sea need not look farther than Cape Cod. Instead of the standard view of ocean and sand, Cape Cod will soon be the site of the first offshore wind farm, Cape Wind: an ambitious project to build wind turbines in Nantucket Sound. On April 28, Interior Secretary Kenneth L. Salazar approved the project, a sign of the Obama administration’s support of alternative energy. We applaud this move—it shows a commitment to move away from fossil fuels, a priority that supersedes any of the drawbacks in this project. After nine years of waiting, we look forward to seeing the construction begin.
Cape Wind will consist of 130 wind turbines that are expected to provide power for 75 percent of Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket. This is a reduction from the previous figure of 170 turbines, but it will still result in a considerable decrease of carbon dioxide released into the air—almost one million tons per year.
Many of the main complaints against Cape Wind were voiced by some of those living in the area, specifically members of The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound. They object to the wind farm’s aesthetic damage and possible effect on tourism, as they believe that Cape Cod is an historical sight that should be left untouched. Others argue against the cost of the project, estimated to be between one and two billion dollars. Still others believe that this is a sign of excessive corporate power over American public space, and fishermen are worried about the effect on fishing grounds. A final complaint concerns the effect Cape Wind will have on the area, which is an ancient burial ground for Native American tribes.
All of these grievances are important to recognize. However, the time for debate has passed, and the parties involved need to move forward. Salazar’s endorsement is an excellent sign of progress for green politics, and Cape Cod residents should be proud of their position at the forefront of the alternative energy movement. It is true that the area has historical significance, but Cape Wind is too important an opportunity to pass up: It represents an evolution of energy production away from the polluting technlogies of the past. Thus, it is also an historic moment worth cherishing—and we hope the project moves forward on-time and on-budget.
As for the Native Americans who feel the government is undermining their heritage, Salazar and other policy makers have stressed that there will likely be compensation. At the very least, any discoveries of archeological finds on the seabed would cease construction until the Department of Interior is notified. Thus, this is not Manifest Destiny, Part II; the U.S. Government is mindful of the concerns of Native Americans.
The need to move past environmentally devastating energy production is extremely pertinent. The U.S. needs to be a leader in alternative energy if it is to motivate the world to pursue greener technology. Especially after the recent fatal explosion and resulting oil spill off of the Gulf Coast, there is a sense of urgency. The failures of offshore drilling cannot be ignored, and fossil fuels are unsafe, unhealthy, and unethical. The U.S. should become more self-sufficient when it comes to energy, and Cape Wind is one exemplary part of this strategy.

We may soon have to rethink our view of the “tolerant” Dutch. In the Netherlands’s upcoming general election, the far-right candidate, Geert Wilders, is the current favorite to end up as prime minister in a coalition government. However, Wilders has labeled Islam “retarded” and has called to ban the Koran. These dismaying steps are part of an eruption of Islamophobia throughout Europe. Across the Continent, the far right has exploited fears of terrorism and changing demographics with great success. Although people should have the right to oppose a dramatic change in the make-up of their societies, something far more radical may be afoot in Europe. Years after Europeans heralded the success of multiculturalism, open vilification of Islam has become standard in many mainstream parties.
The recent Swiss referendum on the building of minarets, spires used to call Muslims to prayer, is a perfect example of how Islamophobia extends beyond a vocal minority. Recently, 57 percent of Switzerland’s population voted to ban the construction of future minarets in their country. This response seems excessive because there are currently four minarets in Switzerland and roughly five percent of the population follows Islam. The danger of the Alps’ chocolate-box villages being swept away in favor of numerous variants of the Blue Mosque looks slim. A comment by Roberto Calderoli of Italy’s anti-immigrant Northern League sums up what this vote is about, “Switzerland is sending to us a clear signal; yes to bell towers, no to minarets.” It is very much about Islam, and the rejection of a “foreign” culture.
Fear of Islamic culture is encapsulated also in the Europe-wide debate over the veil. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has promised to push ahead with a ban on the full veil, and Belgium has become the first European nation to hold a successful vote on the subject. A concerted effort has been made to tie the debate over Islamic dress to women’s rights within Muslim society. Politicians repeatedly invoke the need to “liberate women,” while some left-wing members of parliament have gone so far as to label the burqa a “walking coffin.” That most of the women who dress in this way appear to have made a voluntary decision to do so appears to not matter. As in Switzerland, far-right parties have persuaded voters that the veil is unequivocally a symbol of Europe’s Islamification—even though only an estimated 1,900 women wear the full veil in France out of six million Muslims. Polls indicate that 70 percent of the French public supports a ban on the burqa, even though a fraction of this number would be in favor of outlawing similar expressions of faith from other religions such as crosses and yarmulkes.
Banning minarets and burqas may only be the beginning. In Italy, the Northern League is increasing its numbers in Silvio Berlusconi’s ruling coalition and came out on top in many of March’s regional elections. The party specializes in “Muslim-baiting” and has called for boats carrying illegal immigrants from North Africa to be shelled. A popular campaign poster warns that native Italians will end up on reservations like their American counterparts as a consequence of immigration. The League now has control of the Italian Interior Ministry, while Berlusconi himself has proclaimed the “superiority” of Western culture over Islamic culture.
However, even the situation in Italy pales in comparison to the Dutch situation. After years of heavy migration from North Africa and Turkey, the stereotypically tolerant Dutch now believe (poll numbers indicate a massive disparity of over 60 percent) that Islam is incompatible with “modern European life.” As a result, the Dutch government may soon not only drastically curb immigration but also move to outlaw the Koran. The difference between restricting immigration and banning a book exemplifies perfectly how enthusiasm for preventing European society from changing too much has evolved into a radical reaction against Islam. The threat of outright discrimination toward Muslims in Europe is becoming a reality.  European leaders seem prepared to brazenly attack Islam and disregard the basic freedom of expression of which the Continent has become so proud. Even the president of the European Union, Herman Van Rompuy, espouses hard-line opposition to Turkey joining the EU, simply on the grounds of its Islamic population. Multiculturalism in the Old World may soon shape up to be little more than an ideal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To members of the Class of 2014:
You may be wondering how you got here—you’ve spent the past 18 years padding your resume, doing all of your homework, enrolling in foreign-language immersion programs, rehearsing Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons” until your calluses bled, and now you’re finished.  For many of you, gaining acceptance into Harvard was a tireless goal; for others, it was a hopeful prayer before tossing your application in the mail.  Regardless of how you came to call yourself an incoming Harvard student, you made it, and for that, we congratulate you.
As we’re congratulating you, however, we’d like to remind you of the new realities you’ll face as a Harvard student.  The first of these is, of course, tuition.   You may have been accepted into Harvard, but, as with any college, the balance on your term bill will determine whether or not you actually get to live within the gates of Harvard Yard.  After all, a world-class education does cost money. Tuition increased 3.5 percent this past year—that’s $33,696, $48,868 if you include room, board, and a student services fee.
But that’s not all. You should probably buy textbooks, which can cost hundreds of dollars each semester. You may also want some food to snack on when you’re churning out a paper at 2 a.m., and fortunately overpriced burritos from Harvard Square are always available to substitute the money you’re losing with a few extra pounds.  On that note, you may also want to look into a gym membership—it may be expensive, but you have to avoid that freshman fifteen, right?
And what about your social life?  We’re sure you have every intention of working hard and spending your free time in the library (although, why would you want to go to a library? There’s no food allowed, you can’t talk with anyone, and you’re forced to sit at uncomfortable tables).  However, on Friday nights, you will probably want to get out of your dorm. You could see a concert, but ticket prices add up.  You could go out to dinner, but do you really want to spend $20 on fried food?
What if we told you that you could go to a school where seven out of 10 students were on financial aid, and that need-based aid increased more than twice as fast as tuition over the past five years?  What if this school offered free food in the dining halls every night, for the sole purpose of feeding you while you studied?
Intrigued? This same school recently completed a multi-million-dollar renovation of the campus athletic center, allowing its students to work out on brand new cardio machines with TVs for free. The school also just added a cafe to its main college library so its students could study in groups, snack on a sandwich, or relax in one of dozens of armchairs.
And don’t worry about free time. The school remodeled the common space below the freshman dining hall to create a pub where you can sing karaoke, eat 25-cent buffalo wings, or sip on a $2 latte.  There’s also a fund to provide eligible students free tickets to events sponsored by student groups, like concerts, plays, and house formals.
Are you ready to transfer?
Fortunately, that school is Harvard.  While we’re sure you’ve heard of Harvard’s $26 billion endowment, the majority of it is restricted, so funding for much of what we’ve described depends on unrestricted alumni donations.
This year, nearly 40 percent of the financial aid budget is projected to come from unrestricted funds. Despite the economic downturn, Harvard has continued to expand financial aid, allowing it to take the most talented and diverse student body possible regardless of socioeconomic status. Simply put, Harvard’s ambitious financial aid program could not be sustained without the support of seniors and alumni.
You may be wondering why we’re talking about alumni giving—after all, you’re not even a student here, let alone an alumnus.  But while you’re getting ready to start your four years at Harvard, we’re getting ready to leave.  And we depart with the knowledge that Harvard has provided opportunities we couldn’t have gotten anywhere else.  Yet we—like the majority of seniors in our class—will graduate debt-free.  We know that this wouldn’t be possible without the support of alumni donations, which is why we’re choosing to give back so that your four years at Harvard can be as amazing as ours were.
So enjoy your time at Harvard and take advantage of all it has to offer.  And in four years, reflect on your time here. Think about all of the house study breaks and trips to the Malkin Athletic Center.  Think about Lamont Cafe and the Queen’s Head Pub.  Think about wireless internet and intramural sports.  Think about your friends, and all the people on financial aid who enriched your life at Harvard, and consider giving to Senior Gift.

Even in a media environment as frenetic as the one in which we currently reside, the speed with which technology news site Gizmodo somehow became a martyr is remarkable. On the morning of April 19, Jason Chen, Gizmodo’s editor, announced that the site had “found” a prototype of the next edition of the Apple iPhone and proceeded to post pictures, videos, and detailed technical specifications of the device. The site followed up that evening with an account of how Gizmodo “found” the device. In short, an Apple employee—whom Gizmodo outed, even posting a couple of his Facebook photos—brought it to a bar, where he left it by accident. Another bar patron proceeded to steal the device and sold it to Gizmodo for $5,000. The same day, Apple demanded the device returned, and Gizmodo agreed. That Friday, April 23, police obtained a search warrant for Chen’s residence and seized several computers, hard drives, and other electronics.
Given that Chen likely used at least some of these devices to arrange payment for the iPhone, they are certainly relevant to any investigation into both the initial theft and Chen’s purchase of the stolen goods—a crime punishable by a year’s jail time in California. But rather than accept that people who commit felonies tend to get search warrants exercised against them, activists and media outlets reacted to the search by leaping to Chen’s and Gizmodo’s defense. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a generally admirable civil libertarian group focused on protecting rights online, declared the search warrant illegal, agreeing with Gizmodo’s belief that California’s shield laws intended to protect journalists meant that police could not seize computers containing Chen’s notes and data. A representative of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press called the search “an incredibly clear violation of state and federal law.” Jon Stewart of “The Daily Show” even got in on the act, mocking the police for giving Chen the “meth lab in the basement treatment” and implicitly referring to Apple’s lawyers as “Appholes.” On both a legal and moral level, the reaction is bizarre.
The legal argument is the easiest to dispatch. California law does protect journalists from police seizure of notes and other relevant materials under most circumstances. But appeals courts have ruled that it does not protect journalists from searches intended to uncover evidence of criminal conduct. As this was the purpose of the search of Chen’s home, police are in the clear under state law. Nor does the federal Privacy Protection Act provide any relief to Gizmodo. The act specifically allows searches and seizures if “there is probable cause to believe that the person possessing such materials has committed or is committing the criminal offense to which the materials relate.” As Chen’s actions were criminal, this provision applies to his case. The act has not been tested in court, but a previous Supreme Court decision on the matter is clear. “Although stealing documents or private wiretapping could provide newsworthy information,” the Court ruled, “[n]either reporter nor source is immune from conviction for such conduct.”
The moral argument is more complicated. There are clearly cases in which the good created by the use of stolen or illegally obtained materials by journalists trumps prohibitions and laws against theft. Consider New York Times reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau’s Pulitzer-winning article revealing the Bush administration’s illegal and unconstitutional wiretapping of American citizens in the name of counterterrorism. The publication of that story was entirely justifiable both because it resulted in a better-informed citizenry and because it undermined the immoral program it unveiled. The FBI’s subsequent investigation into the leaks that lead to the story, then, cannot be justified, even if the documents that lead to the story were stolen or illegally obtained (which, to be clear, there is no proof that they were).
Releasing details about the next iPhone, however, does not provide value of this kind. Chen and Gizmodo did not break a story; they simply moved up by a few months knowledge that would be public in due time. Apple’s decision to keep the new iPhone under wraps did no one harm, and its release did not help consumers in any real way. It is hard to say, then, that the value added by Chen’s post outweighs the moral harm of his complicity in the theft. The release of the iPhone details, then, is at best a moral neutral. But another component of Gizmodo’s story—the outing of the Apple employee who lost the iPhone—is simply despicable. Gizmodo knew full well that it was putting the employee’s livelihood in danger by publishing his name. The public has no reason to back shield laws that protect journalists who pay so little heed to the lives they may be wrecking.
Contrary to Gizmodo’s protestations, the ethical obligations on journalists and on the rest of the public should be one and the same. As the tech blogger John Gruber wrote, Gawker “is arguing, ‘Hey, bloggers are journalists.’ The state of California is arguing, ‘Hey, you committed a felony.’”

Harvard Business School Professor Nitin Nohria will become the School’s next dean on July 1, the University announced this afternoon.
Nohria, a professor of business administration and co-chair of the school’s Leadership Initiative, was a faculty leader of the MBA Oath movement, a drive to promote professional responsibility within the business community. The movement garnered national attention when hundreds of students signed the pledge around Commencement last year.
During his 22-year tenure at the Business School, Nohria has taught MBA, doctoral, and executive education classes, chaired the organizational behavioral unit, and served as senior associate dean for faculty development. He designed the first-year course on leadership and corporate accountability and also has taught an executive education course on globalization in India.
“[Nohria] is a great leader and has worked in a number of key roles at the school,” said outgoing dean Jay O. Light, who will step down after leading the Business School for five years. “He brings a uniquely global perspective. I think a great future lies ahead of us.”
University President Drew G. Faust said that while making the decision, she consulted a 15-member advisory committee that consisted of 12 Business School faculty members and three professors from other schools within the University and met almost every week.
Throughout the year, Faust sought advice from additional members of the Business School community, inviting them to e-mail her with their thoughts on the dean selection.
Upon accepting the deanship, Nohria said he was prepared to address concerns about business and the MBA degree that arose during the financial crisis.
“It’s hard to deny that to some extent society’s trust in business has taken a hit,” Nohria said. “As dean one of my great hopes is to restore the trust lost, innovate in curriculum, innovate in research, and usher in a new century of innovation that would usher in a new sense of business’s role in society.”
Several members of the MBA Class of 2009 who worked with Nohria on the MBA Oath campaign publicly endorsed Nohria’s candidacy for the deanship in a January letter.
“I’m thrilled—Professor Nohria is the type of person who will ask the difficult questions we need to ask about the institution,” said Umaimah Mendhro, who worked on the open letter.
HBS Alumni Association President Ann M. Kelly, who was Nohria’s student while at the Business School, noted that Nohria possesses the qualities for which alumni asked in the HBS Alumni Board’s open letter to Faust.
“Nohria has the global outlook and a specific expertise in leadership and organization which are really what are needed to lead HBS in the future,” Kelly said.
In addition to his leadership skills, first year MBA student and HBS Student Association Co-President Brett C. Gibson said that Nohria is known for his dedication to students.
Lawrence M. Estrada, a second-year who worked with Nohria on the MBA Oath Project, also expressed his excitement about Nohria’s appointment.
“Nitin is someone who—beyond being intellectual, thoughtful, and charismatic—also empowers students,” Estrada said.

Last week, eight Harvard professors and one senior lecturer were elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of their original research.
Along with 63 other new members and 18 foreign associates, these faculty members will join the elite group of scientists who examine scientific and technological issues and present their findings to policymakers.
The National Academy of Sciences, which now counts 2,097 members and 409 foreign associates among its ranks, was founded in 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln to “‘investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art’ whenever called upon to do so by any department of the government,” according to the Academy’s website. The scientists are often asked to investigate matters relevant to public policy.
“We have to represent science to the government and to the public,” said David A. Weitz, a physics professor who was elected last week.
Election came as a total surprise to her, said sociology professor Mary C. Waters. Other new members echoed this sentiment, as candidates are nominated by current Academy members in a confidential process.
The fields of expertise of the newly elected Harvard contingent range from material physics to quantitative political science.
Weitz studies soft matter–materials that are easy to squeeze into a form, such as skin and foams. He found that all examples of soft matter have “generic physical properties and reasons for why they’re soft,” he said.
Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of public policy, was the only economics professor to be elected to the Academy this year. His most recent work is the book, “This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,” which he co-wrote with Carmen M. Reinhart, an economics professor at the University of Maryland.
He and Reinhart started writing the book before the current financial crisis to help others “understand financial crises in general,” Rogoff said. The book thus offered interesting perspectives on the most recent financial crisis.
William G. Kaelin, a Harvard Medical School professor who is affiliated with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, discovered the role of the von Hippel-Lindau gene in human kidney cancer. His findings were applied to create drugs, now in clinical trials, that counteracts the effects of the VHL gene mutation associated with kidney cancer to slow the cancer’s progression.
Pediatric diseases lecturer Porter Anderson, mathematics professor Michael J. Hopkins, government professor Gary King, statistics professor Donald B. Rubin, and biological chemistry professor Kevin Struhl were also elected.

Harvard Kennedy School Professor Stephen Goldsmith has been tapped for the position of New York City’s Deputy Mayor of Operations, the city’s second in command, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced on Friday.
Goldsmith, a moderate Republican who served as an advisor to President George W. Bush during his 2000 presidential campaign, is known for his innovative approaches to city government during his tenure as mayor of Indianapolis from 1992 to 1999.
“In Steve Goldsmith, we have found someone who—perhaps better than anyone else in the nation—understands the power of innovation,” Bloomberg said in a press release Friday. “Lots of people talk about ‘reinventing government’—Steve Goldsmith has actually done it.”
As deputy mayor, Goldsmith will be in charge of about a dozen different departments—including the Fire and Police Departments and the Office of Management and Budget.
Bloomberg’s choice of an outsider is seen as representative of his third term shake-up, but Goldsmith said he is committed to learning about the distinctive culture and challenges of New York City in the coming weeks. Goldsmith added that his experiences as mayor of Indianapolis will help him in his new position, despite the different challenges each city faces.
“The issues of public management, how to pick up the trash in the best way, how to clean water, are common issues,” Goldsmith said.
Kennedy School Lecturer Robert Behn said that Goldsmith will be able to apply his experiences in Indianapolis and at Harvard to New York City’s unique challenges, but he added he is “worried Goldsmith will become a Yankees fan.”
Goldsmith’s most recent book, “The Power of Social Innovation: How Civic Entrepreneurs Ignite Community Networks for Good,” featured the work of the Bloomberg administration. Goldsmith said that even before the job offer, he had noted the “environment for innovation” Bloomberg cultivated, which left room for risk taking and significant performance management efforts.
While Goldsmith said he was surprised by Bloomberg’s offer, he said his choice to return to public service fits with the mission of the Kennedy School.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 called Goldsmith’s appointment a “brilliant move,” and added that Goldsmith’s research work on technology, privatization in government, and other innovative policies will allow him to bring change to New York City management.
This new connection between the Kennedy School and New York City government will create more opportunities for Harvard students, according to Ellwood, who added that the timeline for Goldsmith’s departure is still uncertain despite his June 1 start date.

The Undergraduate Council adopted one of two proposed constitutional amendments regarding re-election requirements for UC Executive Board members during the last general meeting this semester on Monday.
The first amendment—entitled “The Officer Transition Exception Act”—will require all UC Executive Board members to seek re-election if they move from a freshman dorm to an upperclassmen House or transfer Houses, and passed with 46 votes supporting the measure and four opposing.
However, the second amendment proposal stipulating that all Executive Board members—not just those who switch districts—must run for re-election every fall failed with 25 votes in favor and 25 against. Constitutional amendments must pass with a three-fourths vote of the entire Council and no abstentions are allowed, said Rules Committee Chair Luis A. Martinez ’12.
Under existing UC bylaws, each Council member is elected annually in the fall. But Executive Board members—which include the secretary, treasurer, and five standing committee chairs—serve as executives for a full calendar year and are typically elected internally by the UC at the end of the fall semester.
Had the second amendment passed, Executive Board members’ terms would not be extended by an additional semester before being subject to re-election through the special elections held in February.
Both amendment proposals had ignited debate at the time of their introduction at last week’s UC meeting,  sparking discussion on the democratic legitimacy of existing UC Executive Board re-election policies.
But despite this debate, UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said that this spring semester was the first “without a huge controversy” and allowed for increased proficiency with the Council’s implementation of new initiatives.
“This is the most productive semester we’ve ever had,” Hysen said. “We get more done when don’t hate each other.”
In addition to the adoption of a constitutional amendment, the UC also passed legislation on Monday night to hire a web developer for $1,000 to create a new UC website, to be completed by next fall.
A “UC Party Portal” will also be created for the website to consolidate information on an array of campus social initiatives—including DAPA grants, the Student Initiated Programs (SIP) fund, UC Rooms, UC Speakers and student DJ listings—and “put it all together on one page,” according to Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12.

Health educators, feminist bloggers, and queer activists gathered at the Rethinking Virginity Conference on Monday to critique American society’s negative portrayal of losing one’s virginity.
“Why do we say ‘losing it’ anyway?” said Shelby Knox, a feminist activist and blogger. “Why don’t we say, ‘I am celebrating my first time!’?”
Many of the speakers at the panels, which were hosted by the Harvard Queer Students and Allies, agreed that sex and virginity are often associated with loss and even shame. They argued for a more positive approach to sexuality.
“Being sex-positive means being anti-fear and pro-information, and that can mitigate shame,” said Sarah Morton, president of the Eastern Massachusetts Abortion Fund.
Morton also spoke at the Monday panel “Toward A Sex-Positive Vision of Abstinence,” which focused on the dissemination of information to young students.
“We want to explore a vision of sex education that can reach people just beginning to explore sexuality,” said Lena Chen ’09-’10, the panel moderator and QSA women’s events and outreach chair.
Chen, who created the blog Sex and the Ivy as a student at Harvard, said that middle school and high school sex education programs tend to preach abstinence by emphasizing the failure rates of most forms of birth control and the emotional and psychological harms accompanying premarital sex.
“Abstinence is like other methods of birth control—only effective when used consistently and correctly,” said Knox, the feminist blogger.
She added that the federal government funds sex education programs that advocate abstinence until marriage, painting a picture of sex as leading to physical and emotional problems.
“I don’t think the way we are teaching kids about sex is teaching them to be sexually healthy adults,” said panelist Megara Bell, founder of the Newton, Mass.-based organization Partners in Sex Education. “We don’t want to teach that sex is dirty and gross, but suddenly becomes okay in marriage.”
Panelists said that in addition to painting a negative picture of sex, institutionalized sex education tends to disregard alternate explorations of sexuality—particularly queer sexuality.
“When you have two men or two women who are doing something, it doesn’t fit into the heteronormative conception of virginity,” said QSA Co-chair Christian L. Garland ’10-’11, who spoke at the panel “Popping the Queer Cherry.”
“We have a cultural tendency to place influence on the first time someone has sex, but the first time isn’t necessarily the most meaningful,” he explained.
Panelists agreed that while society probably will continue to lay stress on the first time, losing one’s virginity is not like losing one’s keys. They expressed hope that social discourse about sex could become more positive in the future.

After a large water main break on Saturday left Boston without drinkable tap water for three days, Harvard schools and affiliates in the city are reflecting on their responses to the water crisis.
As a result of the potential water contamination—which would not have affected Cambridge’s water supply—the state issued a “boil-water” order for 30 Boston-area communities.
While the ban ended early yesterday after Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 announced that water flowing through the pipes was now safe to drink, some of Harvard’s schools felt lingering effects throughout the day.
An administrator at the Harvard School of Public Health, which was in the process of clearing water taps and reconnecting ice machines yesterday, said that the crisis had been a good test for the school’s emergency management team.
“I think it was obviously an inconvenience, but, more importantly, it was a good drill in seeing how quickly we could mobilize to ensure that our school was as safe as it could be from a possible contamination,” said Paul S. Riccardi, the school’s chief operating officer.
While the school brought in coffee from Cambridge and closed its salad bar while the “boil water” order was in effect, Riccardi said that lab work was largely unaffected.
Harvard Business School echoed Riccardi’s sentiment, saying its plans had been effective.
“The hard work and cooperation of a team of individuals representing numerous departments at HBS helped us manage through this situation with as little disruption as possible,” said Andrew F. O’Brien, the Business School’s chief of operations.
Massachusetts General Hospital, a Harvard Medical School affiliate, would not lift its ban on tap water use before staff members had flushed the system, according to a memo sent to staff members this morning. Ensuring the safety of patients was the hospital’s primary concern, the memo said.
Harvard’s teaching hospitals in the Longwood Medical Area were not affected by the boil-water order, as officials were able to redirect the water supply to keep clean water available in the neighborhood.
The Harvard University Department of Athletics brought in Cambridge water for athletes in its facilities in Allston, according to Director of Athletic Communications Kurt K. Svoboda.
The department reported that drinking water had been restored by 2 p.m. yesterday, in time for many afternoon practices.
“We have treated all our water sources here and are up and running again,” Svoboda wrote in an e-mail. “All-in-all, we were well taken care of.”

Boston’s water crisis and the newly-submitted budget for fiscal year 2011 were among the topics of discussion at the Cambridge City Council meeting Monday night.
While a major water main break that occurred on Saturday left around two million Boston-area residents without consumable tap water, Cambridge remained unaffected by the leak because it has a separate water system.
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 requested that City Manager Robert W. Healy clarify how the city came to have a separate water system from the one serving the Boston area, which is managed by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA).
Healy attributed the creation of a separate water system to the foresight of the Cambridge city fathers in the 1800s, who worked with the Massachusetts Legislature to acquire Fresh Pond, which became the city’s water source.
“Cambridge has situated an extremely fortunate position with its water reservoirs,” said Healy. “This is an asset that not many communities can lay claim to.”
Healy added that in case of a water emergency, Cambridge also has the capacity to switch to MWRA water.
“We have a back-up,” he said, noting that the communities affected by the water main break do not have a similar alternative.
In addition to discussions of the water crisis, Healy also gave an overview of the budget for fiscal year 2011.
He said that the new $459 million budget marks a 3.1 percent increase over the previous year’s budget, the result of a 3 percent salary raise for employees, a 7.4 percent increase in employee health insurance, and other increased costs such as debt servicing.
He also addressed “a very weird phenomenon” in which certain city employees, such as police officers and firefighters, who get paid on Thursdays will account for another $1.2 million increase in the budget due to a 53rd pay week in fiscal year 2011.
A reduction in state aid and the increase in the city’s budget will result in a “modest” property tax increase, Healy said. He added that his goal over the next three months is to reduce the tax levy impact, which he hopes will amount to less than 6 percent. The precise percentage increase will be determined in September.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, chair of the Finance Committee, added that, despite the drop in state funding, the city’s school system will remain a priority to ensure that “every child regardless of their wealth or lack of it will have an education.”
Public hearings to discuss the fiscal year 2011 city budget will begin today and continue throughout the month of May.

A new report from the Congressional Budget Office questioned universities’ issuance of tax-exempt bonds, a method Harvard has employed to raise cash over the past years.
The study, released last Friday, raised the concern that the universities with large investment portfolios engage in “indirect tax arbitrage” by selling low-cost, tax-exempt bonds to finance some expenditures instead of spending endowment funds invested in high-yield assets.
The report was requested in 2007 by Senator Charles E. Grassley (R–Iowa), who has made greater oversight of nonprofits a hallmark of his tenure on the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is currently the ranking member.
Though Harvard has issued tax-exempt bonds as recently as January, which saw the completion of a $480 million bond offering, the potential implications of the report for the University remain unclear.
Suzanne Day, Harvard’s director of federal relations, said that the tax exemptions are integral to the success of American universities.
“It has helped to make our system and the research and teaching it offers the model for the rest of the world,” Day said. “Reviewing these programs periodically is appropriate.”
The University has over $6.5 billion in outstanding debt—though not all in the form of tax-exempt bonds—which it has used to finance capital projects such as Harvard Law School’s Northwest Corner Building, as well as to refinance other debt, according to a January report from Moody’s Investors Service.
On Friday, Grassley questioned whether universities’ broad tax exemptions effectively serve a social good.
“The federal government forgoes the revenue from tax-exempt entities in exchange for the social benefit from these institutions. This report raises questions for parents, students, and taxpayers about universities’ issuing bonds and going into debt when they have money in the bank,” Grassley said in a statement on his Senate website.
According to the report, nearly all of the 231 universities studied could be classified as conducting tax arbitrage under a certain definition, though their actions are permissible under current law.
No legislation is currently under consideration about the matter, and Grassley—who has previously pushed regulatory changes concerning endowment spending—indicated that the report’s findings required further thought.

Progress is slow as the University plans for the largest restructuring of the library system in at least 30 years.
The Library Implementation Group, charged this fall with making concrete changes to the University library system by the winter of 2010, will instead generate another, more specific round of proposals at the end of its one-year tenure.
The Implementation Group—which was charged with reforming Harvard libraries’ sprawling administrative structure, adjusting the collection policy to meet financial constraints, and unifying the disparate information technology systems across the libraries—will now provide “another layer of recommendations,” said Harvard Divinity School Professor David C. Lamberth, who chairs the committee.
The proposals, pending approval from the deans, provost, and president of the University, would then lead to a speedy implementation, Lamberth said.
Last November, University Provost Steven E. Hyman released the findings of the Task Force on University Libraries, which questioned the system’s ambitious collection strategy and disjointed administrative structure. In an e-mail to the community, Hyman wrote that the eight members of the Implementation Group—which includes administrators from across the University—would “carry forward” the Task Force’s recommendations.
Lamberth said that the Implementation Group’s goals changed after the members began work.
“The Task Force report imagined a series of independent improvements among different things,” Lamberth said. “But we have come to see that things are more interdependent than they first seemed.”
If the Task Force report was “diagnostic,” the Implementation Group, which meets at least two times a month, is focusing on the logistics of “com[ing] up with a set of solutions,” Lamberth said.
The group is currently conducting reviews of different aspects of the system and has placed its focus on five key areas—including IT infrastructure, serials purchasing, the financial model of the library system, and increased collaboration, possibly through the consortium BorrowDirect, to which all other Ivy League schools belong.
Chicago-based Huron Consulting Group is in the midst of conducting reviews of the libraries’ organization, governance, and structure, and taking inventory of the libraries’ space across campus.
Meanwhile, the libraries have seen a series of small-scale reforms. A search box will be added to the library website homepage in the coming weeks, Lamberth said, a concern raised by students as part of the Implementation Group’s information-gathering.
In addition, the Harvard College Library—the largest library unit within the University—forged a collaboration with MIT last month to provide undergraduates at the respective institutions access to both libraries.
Since the Implementation Group’s inception, members of the Faculty have expressed concerns that their thoughts would not be incorporated in library reform—a particularly potent concern because their research is so intertwined with the libraries. The Faculty Advisory Group, a channel for concerns from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, began preliminary meetings last month.
“Everything is very much up in the air,” said Harvard Medieval Art History Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger, who chairs the Faculty Advisory Group.

Carolyn S. M. Stein ’13 and Anna C. Mapes ’13 clinched victory at the second annual Harvard Top Chef competition yesterday at Annenberg.
The freshman duo, competing as “Team Annenberg,” edged out the upperclassman representatives from each House. They won kitchen utensils, monogrammed Harvard University Dining Services aprons with the winners’ initials, and a $100 gift card to local French bistro Chez Henri.
Though Stein and Mapes took the top accolades with their corn fritter and salmon combination, some upperclassmen also brought their talents to the table.
The Currier team, which came in second place, concocted a new twist on the peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich by adding yogurt dip and bananas.
Team Pforzheimer, which was represented solely by Chelsea S. Link ’12, claimed third place with a Greek chicken sandwich entree and apple crisp.
All contestants had 30 minutes to make two dishes—an entree and a dessert—using only ingredients found in the Annenberg servery.
Their concoctions were then judged by food blogger and Harvard Culinary Society president Lingbo Li ’11, who is also a Crimson staff writer, Chez Henri owner and chef Paul O’Connell, and HUDS director for culinary operations Martin T. Breslin.
All the teams had competed at the House level to qualify for the College-wide competition, but the experience level ranged from novice to experienced.
Adams House residents Steve Teng ’10 and Jade D. Guedes first met at the Adams Culinary Club and both were experienced cooks. They entered the competition with “no plan whatsoever,” according to Teng.
“We’re definitely not expecting to win,” Teng said before the competition started. “It would be nice though.”
Other competitors identified themselves as casual cooks.
Erin E. Walczewski and Luke Walczewski, who are married tutors in Kirkland House, said they had not known about the Harvard-wide Top Chef contest when they entered the Kirkland competition.
“When we competed at the Kirkland level, we thought we were competing for a candy bar,” Erin Walczewski said.
She and her husband entered the competition as “Team Zeus.”
Lowell House residents Heidi H. Liu ’11 and Rebecca L. Gruskin ’11 decided to cook comfort food because they hail from Minnesota and “Minnesota is a nice place with friendly people,” Gruskin said.
Their concoctions included a poached apple and brown sugar-imbued summer salad.
“I tend to like things that aren’t chicken, chicken, chicken cooked three different ways,” Gruskin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Dining Services Executive Director Ted A. Mayer pointed out the weaknesses of different proposals to bring hot breakfast back to the Houses at an Undergraduate Council meeting on Monday.
Closing the current HUDS deficit of $781,000 would require an increase in student board costs by 4.9 percent, Mayer said. Board fees only went up by 3.8 percent from last year to this year, and HUDS was forced to tap its $2.5 million in reserves.
Though the hot breakfast cuts have saved $900,000, HUDS has considered various plans to reinstate hot breakfast, Mayer said. But most suggestions have been “nickels and dimes—they don’t really have an impact.”
Mayer said that hosting hot breakfast in one House in each of Harvard’s four upperclassman neighborhoods would save only $400,000—less than half of the savings from this year’s cuts. He added that it would be problematic to have to decide which Houses would host hot breakfast.
In response to the proposal that HUDS serve hot breakfast once a week in different Houses, Mayer said that it would violate the current union contract, which prohibits juggling HUDS staffers between Houses, and would create scheduling difficulties.
Mayer also rejected the suggestion that HUDS staffers cook hot breakfast foods the night before and reheat them in the morning, saying that it would be “quite impossible unless we give you frozen quiches or something like that,” which would compromise food quality.
According to Mayer, HUDS has saved a total of $2.7 million due to changes to the academic calendar, administrative cuts, the early retirement package for staffers, and menu changes like the elimination of hot breakfast.
He added that approximately two staffers in each House were able to keep their jobs as a result of the hot breakfast cuts.
Mayer addressed the complaint that the administration did not solicit student input before deciding to cut hot breakfast by pointing to the compressed decision-making timeframe.
“Many people involved in the working groups recognized that it would have been better to have student input...but there wasn’t a lot of time to include students,” he said.
According to a student survey, which had a 50 percent participation rate, breakfast attendance rates have remained static this year in spite of the elimination of hot breakfast, Mayer noted.
But HUDS may need to implement more budget cuts if it sets out to eliminate its deficit, Mayer said.
“You just keep shaving away any time that there is an opportunity to do so,” he said. “We’re pretty bare bones right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I, Part II, and Part IV of this story appeared on April 30, May 3, and May 7, 2010.)
Late at night—as often as two or three times a week—Sarah A. Rankin, the director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, wakes up in the dead of night to the ringing of her cell phone.
She answers the calls, which range from late-night panic attacks about past sexual assaults to questions about what to do immediately after a rape has taken place. Some nights she gets in her car and rushes to meet the caller, occasionally taking the person to the hospital herself.
As Harvard’s go-to contact for victims of sexual assault, Rankin has taken on the job of listening to, talking to, and advising survivors of sexual assault, no matter the time of day or night.
“Someone has to be available 24/7,” she says. “People need to talk about it when they need to talk about it.”
After seven years, OSAPR has established itself as a hub for issues surrounding sexual assault—whether by helping recent victims cope with their traumatic ordeals, educating the campus at large about sexual violence, or rallying men on campus to play a role in combatting these often overlooked issues.
The two and a half-member office has, by most accounts, been an invaluable resource for undergraduates, though beginning next academic year it will face the challenge of expanding its services to the entire University without any additional staff or resources.
CONSTRUCTING A NEW RESOURCE
After two high-profile cases of sexual assault occurred on Harvard’s campus in 2002, students and faculty urged the administration to address the problems surrounding sexual assault, according to Susan B. Marine, assistant dean of students and director of the Harvard College Women’s Center.
Additionally, a student anonymously filed a complaint about a change in the College’s procedure for handling sexual assault cases, which launched a U.S. Department of Education investigation to determine whether the University was violating federal laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs.
While the inquiry eventually concluded that Harvard had not violated federal regulations, the investigation resulted in the formation of the Leaning Committee, which re-evaluated the College’s sexual assault policies. The committee eventually recommended the creation of OSAPR, an increase in sexual assault prevention education, and several changes to the procedure the Administrative Board—the College’s primary disciplinary body—follows when handling sexual assault cases.
“It would never have happened without student activism holding the institution accountable,” says Marine, the original director of OSAPR. “We had the opportunity to build a model program dedicated to comprehensive services for survivors.”
The Leaning Committee, chaired by Human Rights Professor Jennifer Leaning, ruled that the office should employ two and a half full-time staff members, establish a 24-hour crisis line, and coordinate events signifying commitment to education and prevention work on campus.
The office opened in July 2003, and by the accounts of students and administrators, it has been successful in achieving the objectives set forth by the committee.
Marine says that prior to the creation of OSAPR, the only recourse for students who had been sexually assaulted was University Health Services, which she says did not always have the resources for the specific physical and psychological aid needed by victims.
SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS
In keeping with its focus on being a source of support for sexual assault survivors, OSAPR recognizes that its primary service is to provide victims with someone to speak with about their experiences.
The OSAPR employees—Rankin, an education specialist, and a prevention specialist—and OSAPR’s student volunteers offer generally non-directive advice regarding the Ad Board, medical and legal recourses, therapy, and other possible outlets for survivors.
In addition to gaining information about the range of resources available to victims, many survivors use the office as a place to grapple with their complicated emotions and stories.
“I think many survivors feel that the best way they can heal is by talking about their experience and just having someone there to listen,” says Julia H. Nunan-Saah ’11, an OSAPR volunteer. “With traumatic experiences like rape, it helps to be able to recount the event to someone who will be supportive and allow the survivor to feel sad or angry, or whatever other emotions may come up.”
In addition to OSAPR’s hotline, there are several other outlets for students—whether they are victims, friends of victims, or people who just need to talk—to find someone willing to listen while respecting their anonymity.
The most prominent is Response, a peer-counseling line whose counselors—all female undergraduates—are trained by the OSAPR staff to provide both immediate aid for sexual assault victims and support for people facing domestic abuse or other relationship issues.
“We’re there to be with survivors and help them process their emotions by acting as a sounding board for their experiences,” said the co-director of Response, who asked to remain anonymous because Response is a confidential organization. She added that as helpful as Rankin and the OSAPR staff are, sometimes victims just want to talk to a fellow student.
NO ‘STRANGER IN THE BUSHES’
While OSAPR and Response try to ease the healing process for students who have experienced the trauma of sexual assault, the office is also working to fight sexual assault before it occurs.
“Prevention is about managing risks that will reduce the possibility of violence and about creating a culture where it is unacceptable to commit rape,” Marine says. She adds that in order to effectively put a stop to violence, both women and men must confront the reality of sexual assault and change their attitudes about when and how frequently sexual assault takes place.
One major obstacle to prevention, she says, is students’ assumption that sexual assault is a rare occurrence and will never happen to them.
“Virtually no one is raped by a stranger jumping out of the bushes,” she says, adding that many people take refuge in this stereotype to avoid the notion that rape could happen to them or someone they know.
“People tend to distance themselves from a feeling of vulnerability, and the only way to make emotionally difficult topics more realistic and more relevant to their lives is to have more people talking about it,” Marine says.
She says that OSAPR workshops, particularly the mandatory educational performance “Sex Signals” at the beginning of freshman year, are the best ways to combat the idea that sexual assault is not a problem relevant to Harvard students.
The co-director of Response says that, in addition to these workshops, creating a space for open dialogue on campus is an important step toward preventing future cases of sexual assault. She says that a significant reason people dismiss sexual assault is because they are reluctant to recognize that the majority of sexual assault cases are perpetrated not by the “stranger in the bushes,” but by an acquaintance, romantic interest, or even significant other.
“Coming to the realization that sexual assault could happen in your own dorm room with a friend or a person you’re seeing is really scary to think about, but it’s something you can’t deny,” she says, adding that many people dismiss this possibility by telling themselves that it could not happen to them.
“The key to an open dialogue is for people to realize that these experiences could happen to them or someone they care about,” she says. “For those of us who already recognize this is, it’s our responsibility to step up and start a wider dialogue.”
Marine says that the visible presence of OSAPR and the work it does to publicize the issue serve as a constant reminder of the existence of sexual assault on campus.
“There are very inexact ways of knowing whether OSAPR’s presence is changing people’s behavior, but it’s certainly raising reporting rates,” she says. “The virtue of having an office at all puts it on people’s radar, and the by-product is more awareness. Ideally that will ultimately result in fewer instances of sexual assault.”
AN EXPANDED MISSION
While Response and OSAPR have become central to Harvard College’s response to sexual assault, few other colleges have similar programs or offices to address these problems on their campuses.
“We’re able to offer students a place that provides comprehensive resources 24/7,” Rankin says, adding that few campuses provide this level of support. “We are very proud of our office. It’s small, but it exists.”
While it currently only works with undergraduates, the office will expand its services to the entire Harvard community beginning next fall.
As part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ budget cuts—which began nearly two years ago—OSAPR’s budget was reduced by 25 percent, according to Rankin, and the office will not see an increase in its budget or the number of staff members as it expands to serve the entire University.
While Rankin says the office already fields phone calls and drop-ins from graduate students, its new purview will almost certainly be accompanied by an increase in responsibilities.
“OSAPR provides critical and compassionate services to students who are victims of sexual assault, as well as to their friends and significant others,” wrote Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds in an e-mailed statement. “This decision will send a stronger, clearer message to students at all Harvard’s Schools that they can turn to OSAPR for assistance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Feminism is a word that some people wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot pole. Though it is sometimes perceived as a unilateral campaign against men, women’s rights and gender equality groups are increasingly presenting it as a movement in which people of all genders can be involved. Many scholars, activists, and student leaders are coming to redefine the term. Many of these are men.
“As a guy, I’m happy to be a feminist,” says Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, a workshop leader at the Office of Sexual Response and Prevention and the co-founder of MenSpeakUp, a website that promotes gender equality. “All it means is that you believe in equal rights.”
MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT FEMINISM
Many men are reluctant to self-identify as feminist even though they support women’s issues, says Susan B. Marine, director of the Women’s Center and assistant dean of student life.
“Men hold onto the assumption that feminists are man-haters, that there’s no way to be pro-women without being anti-men,” she says. “We need to show that it’s not just a women’s movement so that men can feel willing to sign on.”
Marine explains that part of the aversion to self-identifying as feminist has to do with misconceptions surrounding the term, partially perpetuated by feminists themselves.
Van Vuuren explains men’s varying involvement with a bell curve model, with one end representing males who objectify women, including rapists and misogynists, and the other side featuring men who are overtly and actively involved in feminist advocacy.
While these two poles often attract the most attention, Van Vuuren suggests that most men lie in the middle.
These men support women but do not publicly vocalize their sentiments, indicating that more men care about women’s issues than meets the eye, but few engage in these discussions. These are the kind of men Van Vuuren hopes will transition to the side of visible advocacy.
A PRIVILEGED PERSPECTIVE
Though men can approach the feminist movement with intentions to help, they can often end up assuming dominant roles at the expense of women’s empowerment.
“Men are socialized to be the leader and be in charge, and women are socialized to let men do that,” says Chris Linder, director of the Office of Women’s Programs and Studies at Colorado State University, adding that this can lead to a sense of superiority among men.
Linder conducted a study to examine women’s experiences collaborating with men in the feminist movement. While she notes that men and women successfully co-facilitated workshops, including discussions of sexual assault, she also observed drawbacks when men crowded out the very women they were trying to help.
“Men have a general lack of awareness around their privilege,” Linder says. “They are not aware of dominant identities, so they inadvertently take up extra space.”
SOCIAL PERMISSION
Harvard Men Against Rape is one successful example of men coming together to advocate for women’s equality and safety from sexual assault.
According to HMAR member Christopher M. Gilbert, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the group’s goal is not to be a leader in the movement for women’s rights, but to back it up.
Gilbert adds that while only a handful of men participated in OSAPR training sessions several years ago, this year 25 to 30 men have dedicated themselves to participating in substantive anti-misogyny work.
“There’s not much space for men in those type of groups, and we wanted to give a special space for men that want to engage in that work,” Gilbert says, referring to groups like HMAR.
However, he notes that male participants are still few, often because of social pressure that they feel to conform to traditional standards of masculinity. He notes that it is easier for men to care about race issues, but few are quick to rally around gender outreach, and this is something that must be changed.
MEN IN ACTION
Andres Castro Samayoa ’10, an intern at the Women’s Center and co-president of the Women’s Leadership Project, demonstrates the ability to take on a leadership role in the women’s movement while making sure women’s voices are still heard.
Though he says that he initially questioned his leadership position in a women’s organization, he realized that a “long-term, feasible, workable solution” must involve all genders.
“I wondered about the political implications of being a male leading WLP and whether it would be seen as a political irony by having a non-woman in a leadership position,” Castro Samayoa says. “It is something that I grapple with and it was important for me to use it as an opportunity to invite people of other genders to be a part of it.”
Marine says that men’s effectiveness in the movement depends on whether they lead in a thoughtful manner.
“It’s not counteractive to the goals of feminism to have men lead women’s groups, but it could be problematic if they’re not self-aware about how they approach their work,” Marine says.
ENCOURAGING SUPPORT
Both Marine and Castro Samayoa suggest ways for men to become respectfully involved and supportive of feminism.
Marine says that men can be more effective by confronting other men about issues of gender equality.
“When a man addresses another man about a problem in society, he may be more likely to see it as something pertinent to his own life than if a woman brought it up,” she says.
Castro Samayoa notes that men, like those coming from the middle of the bell curve, need to have their assumptions about feminism challenged in order to take an active stance in the movement.
“I had a visceral philosophy and general idea of how I would like to see the world, but I didn’t know quite how to express it,” he says, adding that he wanted to take a more proactive role when he came to Harvard. “College helped me find a community where I started to realize that feminism was about creating communities and trying to come together to develop tangible ways of supporting women.”
By using their voices to encourage equality, respect for people of all genders, and healthier social norms among men and women, he says, men can help people see women’s rights as human rights.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William H. Foege, a senior fellow in the Global Health Program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was awarded the inaugural Thomas H. Weller Prize yesterday at the “Ancient Diseases, Modern Killers: The Eradication of Infectious Disease” symposium sponsored by the Harvard School of Public Health.
A graduate of the School of Public Health, Foege is an epidemiologist who was involved in the campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. He was later awarded an honorary degree from the University in 1997.
“Bill has had an industrious career,” said School of Public Health Dean Julio Frenk, who presented Foege with the award. “[He] exemplifies how leaders can make enormous contributions in global health...his career has truly been an inspiration to many, including myself.”
Weller, the award’s namesake and the symposium’s honoree, was a physician and virologist who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1954 for his work in tissue-culture research, which led to the development of vaccines for polio, chicken pox, measles, and other viral diseases. Weller died in 2008.
The symposium featured a presentation on “The Unfinished Agenda of Infectious Diseases” by Barry R. Bloom, professor of public health and former dean of the School of Public Health, as well as a panel discussion about the eradication of infectious diseases.
In his acceptance speech, Foege said he thought the symposium was notable in covering not only the science of infectious diseases, but also the greater social implications of disease and the spirit of Weller’s work.
“I’m pleased to have been a mentee of Tom Weller,” he said. “I’m pleased to have been able to been a part of this moment, and I’m pleased that you’re keeping Tom’s contribution flowing on forever.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s spring formal season, and the Harvard women’s tennis team is going dancing.
Today, the NCAA Division 1 Tennis Subcommittee announced a field for the 64-team championship tournament that included the Crimson for the first time since 2006.
Harvard (14-7, 6-1 Ivy) picked up an at large bid with its number 39 national ranking, the highest for the squad since Jan. 30, 2007. The Crimson will play No. 19 Georgia (12-8, 8-3 SEC) on May 14th at the Hoke Sloan Tennis Center in Clemson, S.C.
Harvard’s only nationally ranked player is sophomore No. 73 Holly Cao, while the Bulldogs have No. 12 Chelsey Gullickson and No. 48 Nadja Gilchrist. The two Georgia women combine to form the No. 8 doubles duo in the nation.
Should the Crimson defeat the Bulldogs, the squad will play on May 15th against the winner of No. 9 Clemson (22-5, 9-2 ACC) and No. 67 College of Charleston (20-9, 10-0 SoCon), who won the Southern Conference Championship.
Harvard’s selection to the NCAA tournament comes after a second consecutive successful season under head coach Traci Green. Last year, the Crimson shared an Ivy League title with Princeton, but the Tigers won the tiebreaker to represent the Ivy League in the NCAA field. This year, despite finishing second in the conference, Harvard’s national ranking was enough to earn them a spot.
In its history, the Crimson has earned a birth in the NCAA tournament 13 times and holds an 8-13 record. Harvard’s last win took place in the second round of the 2005 bracket when it defeated Oregon, 4-0, before losing to Stanford by the same score in the Round of 16—the farthest the team has ever gone in the tournament,
Historically, the Crimson’s tournament appearances have come in stretches (1984-88, 1996-1999, 2003-2006), a welcome sign for a Harvard squad that is not graduating any seniors.
News of the tournament comes a few days after Harvard learned that four of its players had won postseason awards.
Freshman Hideko Tachibana, who went 14-6 (6-1 Ivy) this season at No. 2, was a unanimous selection for Ivy League Rookie of the Year. She is the first Harvard player to win the award since Laura Peterzan ’09 in 2005-06. Tachibana was a unanimous selection to the first team All-Ivy squad.
Cao, who went 15-4 (5-2 Ivy) at No. 1 and finished the season nationally ranked, was also unanimously named to the first team All-Ivy team.
Freshman Kristin Norton earned second team All-Ivy honors with her 14-6 (5-2 Ivy) record at No. 3.
The Crimson also had two doubles pairs win honors.
Cao and junior captain Samantha Rosekrans were unanimously named to the All-Ivy first team, going 11-8 (5-2 Ivy) this season at No. 1 doubles for the Crimson.
Tachibana and Norton teamed up at No. 2 doubles this season to go 9-8 (5-2 Ivy), earning them second team All-Ivy honors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rowing great Jim Dietz once said, “Rowing is a sport for dreamers. As long as you put in the work, you can own the dream.”
Last season, the Harvard men’s lightweight varsity eight fell just short of its goal to become league and national champions, placing second at Eastern Sprints and then third at IRAs. Having won the 2009 Jope Cup for overall team points and graduating only three members of its varsity crew, the oarsmen knew there was reason to keep the dream alive.
“Two years ago, it was very clear that it was a rebuilding year,” said captain and three-year varsity eight veteran Martin Eiermann. “We didn’t do very well, but we learned a lot. And last year we had a great season, but there was always a slightly bitter aftertaste. But, when we came back this year, it was pretty clear that since we had won the Jope Cup in the Ivy League and come in second at Sprints, there was only one way to go.”
That way was to the top of collegiate lightweight competition. The No. 1 Crimson men’s lightweight varsity eight (10-0) outraced every crew it lined up against this dual racing season, earning the first unbeaten record for Harvard since 1997.
The team began the onslaught of victory April 3rd on the Charles River, defeating the University of Delaware. After that, Cornell, Penn, Georgetown, Saint Joseph’s, Dartmouth, MIT, and Navy all found themselves rowing in the Crimson’s wake.
This past weekend at the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton Regatta, the varsity capped off its perfect 10-0 season with victories against then-No. 1 Tigers and No. 4 Bulldogs.
The HYP Regatta is a highly anticipated race for each of the participating crews. But, having fallen to both Princeton and Yale at IRAs last year, the Crimson entered this year’s regatta with revenge on its mind.
Off the starting line, the Tigers and Bulldogs took an early advantage on Harvard. After Yale fell off the pace, the Crimson was left to duke it out with Princeton. The Tigers maintained an advantage until the final 500 meters when Harvard’s relentless cadence drew them even and then pushed them ahead in the sprint, winning with a time of 5:40.7 to Princeton’s 5:41.4.
“The problem has never been so much motivating people to go hard but to keep their calm and have no one get flustered,” Eiermann said. “This crew has been particularly good at that. And we did a fantastic job [on Saturday] to deal with Princeton and deal with Yale when they jumped up a couple seats. Instead, we just did what we do best: row our base pace, win the race, and bring it home.”
The varsity eight line-up for this past weekend consisted of senior Dexter Louie at coxswain, sophomore Tim Moore at stroke, sophomore Austin Meyer at seven seat, junior Will Newell at six seat, Eiermann at five seat, junior Billy Hennrikus at four seat, sophomore Tom Nesel at three seat, junior Jared Dourdeville at two seat, and sophomore James Stewart at bow.
Junior Andrew Trott, who raced in the varsity line-up for every race previous to this past weekend, was unable to compete in the HYP Regatta. Nesel filled his spot and helped the varsity to win the Goldthwait Cup.
Although the Crimson’s perfect dual season record makes it appear like they are rising far above the pack, what is perhaps more impressive is that the entire league has gained more speed, and Harvard has still managed to push their bow ball out in front.
“In past seasons, we had races in which other boats were just completely out of it,” Newell said. “There used to be just a handful of fast crews in the league, but this year it is just so much closer. But this is exactly what lightweight racing should be. It should be racing where you’re contesting it for seven-tenths of a second, and where no one is giving up for the whole 2,000 meters. We’re just really happy that we could have a race against Princeton that showed how good both crews are. Of course, we’re happy to have come out on top, but we’re excited about the level of competition in general.”
With a week and a half to go until the Eastern Sprints, there is certainly time for the Crimson to find more speed. A perfect dual season record brings Harvard one step closer to realizing its dream, but for these oarsmen, it will be their finish at Sprints and IRAs that matters most.
“Now we have pretty big targets on our backs,” Moore said. “I think everyone is going to be as hungry as ever to hunt us down. But we just have to continue building on what we’ve been doing, going back to the fundamentals, making every stroke and every practice powerful and strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s simple. Nothing is bigger for the Harvard track and field team than the Heptagonal Championships.
“It’s what we look for all year,” men’s co-captain Jack Brady said. “This is our conference championship.”
“Heps is really exciting,” junior Claire Richardson said. “It’s where you get really good competition and can get good performances out of each other.”
This upcoming weekend, both the men’s and women’s teams hope to garner solid performances as they travel to Princeton’s Weaver Stadium to compete against the seven other schools in the Ivy League.
“Heps is definitely a big deal,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “For a good number of student athletes, it’s the culmination of a lot of hard work. It’s the highlight of the season.”
This season’s Heps should be especially exciting, as the margin between the top four teams in both the men’s and women’s indoor Heptagonal Championships in February was tight. At that event, the Crimson men and women each placed fourth, fighting against Dartmouth and Columbia for the last spot in the top half.
“Our men and women’s teams are in a good spot,” Saretsky said. “We had a strong indoor Heps Championships...[This weekend] it’s going to be a tough battle with a lot of teams vying to finish in the top half.”
Coming off of meets against Brown, Yale, and the top racers at the 116th Penn Relays, Harvard seems prepped and ready to compete against the best of the Ancient Eight, particularly Cornell and Princeton who, combined, have won the last 12 men’s outdoor Heps and the last eight women’s.
For the Crimson men, who finished in sixth-place last spring—three points behind fifth place Dartmouth—this year presents a challenge to rank in the top-four.
“We have high hopes,” Brady said. “We had a great Heps indoor championship earlier this year. We only finished a couple of points out of third place, but we know it’ll be difficult to replicate that performance.”
With top showings from Brady and fellow thrower freshman Edward Brucker last weekend at the Penn Relays, as well as strong performances from co-captain Justin Grinstead, Harvard knows it can compete.
“We believe we have the talent to be a top-four team in the Ivy League,” Brady continued. “That’s our goal, we need to start establishing ourselves as a threat to the top guys. Hopefully, that’s what we’ll do this weekend.”
The women’s team also hopes to finish in the top half of the competition, especially after its distance medley grabbed a first-place finish in Pennsylvania last week.
“I think if we have a good weekend, we could finish top-three,” said Richardson, a member of the four-person medley group. “Mainly, we’re going to go out there and have some good performances. We have a good chance of doing pretty well if everyone steps up to the plate.”
The women will look to grab points from the field squad and the multi-teams, which have consistently improved each meet.
“I really feel the multis [sophomores Christine Reed and Nicole Sliva] have really stepped up their game,” Richardson said. “Those are the first people I think of. They work out all the time, they’re looking great, so I’m looking forward to them to compete.”
Competition will also be fierce for the Crimson ladies as Cornell has won seven of the past eight Hep Championships.
“Our team is going through a process of improvement—each year getting better and better,” Richardson continued. “We’ve used this season to make us better as a team...Hopefully we can use that at Heps.”
Regardless of their finishes, both the men and women’s teams believe that the season has already been a success.
“Overall, it’s been a really strong year for us,” Saretsky repeated. “We’ve done some things that we’ve never been able to do in the program’s history...We’re working hard to getting this program to a place where year in and out we can compete for the championships. We’re not there yet.”
If Harvard gets its way, that point will come sooner rather than later. This weekend though, as Richardson emphasized, total focus will be on one thing.
“All that matters is getting points.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Favorable winds carried the Harvard sailing team through to the finals of the ICSA Coed Dinghy National Championship this past weekend.
The Crimson traveled to Seattle to compete in the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association Western Semi Finals and finished in the top-five thanks to the efforts of junior captain Alan Palmer and classmate Meghan Wareham. The tandem placed fourth overall in the A division, contributing 56 of the 116 points that Harvard put up on the scoreboard.
“Our primary goal was to qualify,” senior Michelle Konstadt said. “We were really happy that we were able to do so, but we were hoping to do better than fifth. We made some mistakes that cost us some points.”
The B division team, composed of Konstadt and juniors John Stokes and Quincy Bock, pitched in the remainder of the points with solid performances in the latter half of the stretch but ended in a weak final race. The team came in sixth overall.
“I think we showed that we could hang with whoever is on the water,” Stokes said. “But we made some silly mistakes that cost us points, and we need to avoid them at nationals if we’re going to be competitive.”
Yale won the tournament with a combined 89 points, 43 of them coming from the A-team that finished second overall. Roger Williams was the top school in the A division, beating out the Bulldogs by two points. But it was its B-team that didn’t fare as well, finishing with 57 points that moved the Hawks down to third place.
St. Mary’s College of Maryland was right behind Yale in second place overall. The Seahawks finished above the Crimson in the A division with 53 points, while its B-team delivered some clutch performances, tallying 38 points for first place in the division.
Palmer and Wareham only had a couple of races where they finished out of the top six, demonstrating consistency for most of the weekend. The duo started off the championship with a third-place finish but hit a slump early on, falling down to ninth place in the third race. They were able to bounce back, coming up with first place in the sixth race and two more consecutive ones in the eighth and ninth races. The team, however, could not keep momentum going into the final race, coming in eighth.
“Alan and Meghan sailed great,” Stokes said. “I would imagine they would say that they also need to avoid the little mistakes, but I think they had a great weekend the results agree. We’re just happy to have qualified for nationals.”
Bock and Konstadt alternated crew duties for the B-team, which started out very strong, but had two races where it came in the bottom half of the 18-team field. The first race resulted in fourth place, while the team improved to second place in the second trial.
“I think we were kind of in a groove,”  Konstadt said. “A lot of it is psychological and mental, and there was definitely momentum on our side. We were really in touch with the shifts, and we got the pattern really well. We were overall pretty fast.”
The team started falling behind a bit until the seventh race, when it posted two consecutive first-place finishes and came in the third spot in the penultimate race.
The team could have fared a bit better had it not come in 15th place in the final heat.
“Take the last race as an example [of a series of silly mistakes],” Stokes said. “We were in the top-five, and then we had to take two penalty turns. Mistakes of that sort are little mental errors that are equivalent to false starts in football. We just can’t have that.”
The top-nine teams earned a berth to the national championship that will take place next month.
The tournament will take place on June 1-3 at Wisconsin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not be a huge surprise coming from Harvard, but some of the Crimson’s top athletes have recently been recognized for their work in the classroom.
As if he hasn’t racked up enough honors so far, NCAA champion wrestler J.P. O’Connor was named to the NWCA All-Academic wrestling team for the third time in his college career. The co-captain has also been named EIWA Wrestler of the Year, co-Ivy League Wrestler of the Year, and Academic All-Ivy in his senior year alone.
The rest of the Harvard’s wrestling team also made its mark and claimed the Division I All-Academic Top Team, just edging out last year’s winner, American University.
Members of the Crimson football team were also honored this week for their academic performance by the National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame.
Seniors Carl Ehrlich, Nick Hasselberg, Thomas Hull, Mike Lawler, J.B. Monu and Conor Murphy were named to the 2010 NFF Hampshire Honor Society. The society, created just three years ago, distinguishes college football players who maintain a 3.2 cumulative GPA and meet other requirements stipulated by the NFF.
The wrestling and football teams are just two of many at the College upholding the tradition of well-rounded student-athletes.

With  reading period almost done and finals looming, Lamonsters and Cabot-Dwellers  alike are starting to feel the weight of late-nights and high-calories  on their shoulders (and stomachs.) Because we at Flyby understand that those  precious espresso shots should be saved for research paper marathons  rather than treadmill miles, we’ve brought you an exercise routine  that can be done right from the comfort of your cozy cubicle.
1. Bicep Book Curls 
Time to actually put that orgo  textbook to some use other than as a doorstop. Load two plastic book bags  with desired number of textbooks (we recommend starting with 1 book in  each bag for CS concentrators and up to 10 in each bag for government concentrators).  Sit on the edge of your seat with your back straight and feet flat on  the floor. Beginning with arms straight and books on the ground, slowly  curl arms up to shoulders, pause, and then lower back down. Repeat 20  times.
2. Second Cup Sprint 
The number of “laps” for  this exercise depends on both how attractive the café staff is on a  given night and your need for caffeine. No matter the number of trips  to refill your mug though, you’ll undoubtedly have to make a mad dash  to the restroom every two cups or so. Choose your own distance, going  all five flights if you can hold it for that long, and sprint up the  stairs to the restroom, catch your breath during the implied break,  and then double your speed on the way back. If you’re working alone,  this will also cut down on the chances of losing the laptop you’ve  left unguarded.
3. Researcher’s Risers 
Move those piles of books you  have yet to read for your research paper off of your desk and onto the  floor, stacking neatly and evenly so that a platform is created (take  extra books from the surrounding shelves if needed). Step up with one  leg and down with the other, switching your leading leg after every 10. Repeat for a count of 40. Note: for an added boost, leave whatever  embarrassing pop music you’ve been blaring for the past 10 hours  on and step to the beat. (A word of caution, however, do not jerk your headphones  out of your computer since toned legs are not worth being the subject of an embarrassing  I Saw You Harvard.)
4. Sleep-Deprived Dips 
Legs straight, hold yourself  up parallel to the floor by placing your hands on the edge of your seat  with arms at a ninety degree angle. Lift up body until arms are straight  and then lower into starting position. To add core conditioning, perform  on a rolling computer chair. More hours awake=more trips to the café  bakery. Do 2 for every granola bar, 5 for every croissant, 10  for every bagel or muffin, and 20 for every other pastry consumed.

Tired of getting kicked out of Widener at 10 p.m.? Can't escape the Law School Library? Is Lamont feeling like too much of a party? We understand what you're going through. In order to make this reading period slightly more bearable, we've found some hidden treasures on campus for those late-night cramming sessions.
 
Quincy Bullitt Room
 
 
Located in the basement of New Quincy, the Bullitt Room's three long tables and white/chalkboards make it one of the best group study spaces on campus. Though you'll usually find this room deserted, it's important to note that sections meet here during the academic term. As a study break (or if you are looking for some musical accompaniment to your studying), take a spin on the room's upright piano. The Bullitt Room's only downside is the industrial lighting - a constant reminder of your underground exile.
Lowell O-014
If the white/chalkboards adorning the walls of Quincy's Bullitt Room provide the perfect environment for efficient group study, then the couches in Lowell O-14 make for most comfortable group study. Though there isn't much table space for writing, the Foosball and pool tables ensure that you won't get much writing done anyway.
Lowell N-012/G-016
If Lowell O-014's lack of table space is getting you down, head to the basement hallway to N-012 or G-016. N-012's tables and chalkboard allow for a more serious group study environment than in its O-entryway counterpart. If you're more of a lone wolf, take a seat in one of G-016's 25 individual desks and plow through all of that reading you've been putting off.
Adams' "Sean Palfrey Parlor"
 
 Although officials in Adams House said that this room doesn't have a name, they did give us permission to christen it the "Sean Palfrey Parlor," after the Adams House Master. To find this very secret study space, enter Adams' Randolph Hall from Bow Street and walk up the first flight of stairs. Before walking up a second set of stairs (and into Adams G entryway or the Adams' courtyard), look to the right. You'll spot a small room with two unbelievably comfortable chairs and accompanying coffee tables. As few Adams House residents are even aware of this room's existence, you're almost guaranteed a space in what is irrefutably Adams House's coziest study space.
