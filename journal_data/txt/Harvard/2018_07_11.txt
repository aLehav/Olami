After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All roads lead to the Waterford household. At least, they do for June (Elisabeth Moss), who unbelievably ends up back there for a third time. Due to her separation from her child, June is unable to produce enough breast milk, appeals to Fred (Joseph Fiennes), and is brought back to her prison cell of a room in his home. Once there, she’s forced to pump her newly lactating breasts while knowing her daughter from afar: hearing Holly’s cries through the floorboards, smelling her worn clothes when no one’s watching.
While she is brought back to her old home, Emily (Alexis Bledel) is brought to a new one, having already been rejected by four couples. The only couple willing to take her in is a strange one, though you wouldn’t know that from Commander Joseph Lawrence’s (Bradley Whitford) reputation as the brilliant “architect behind Gilead’s economy.” If he looks familiar, that’s because he’s Rose’s dad in “Get Out,” and apparently, he’s traded one psychologically thrilling role for another.
In this unfortunate change of setting, the writers give us a glimpse at Gilead in a larger sense. Eleanor, the Commander’s wife, reveals a dark secret in her craze: Commander Lawrence created the Colonies, the toxic wasteland Emily herself was sent to to plough through soil while waiting to die. It’s an interesting piece of information for sure, one that prompts the question: What can and will Emily do with this new discovery? Maybe it will be the push she needs to stop being so cynical and hopeless. But even the small freedoms she is allowed are under Commander Lawrence’s watchful gaze. In the living room, he pours her a glass a wine, of which Emily has a sip to get through the brutal interrogation scene that reveals that Lawrence knows everything about her, from her pre-Gilead life to her genital mutilation. The shot of Emily taking her first, small sip centers her in the middle of the room, surrounded by its darkness. The ensuing silence and the look Commander Lawrence gives her says it all: She may have new information, but he will always have all the power.
Meanwhile, while the two handmaids find themselves in old and new homes, Eden (Sydney Sweeney) runs away from hers with Isaac. Unlike June, however, when they get captured they are sentenced to death by drowning. Eden never breaks character, not even in the final moments before she dies. “Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is does not dishonor others. It is not self-seeking,” she says as her last words. June, like us, rolls her eyes through her tears, and you have to wonder—what was the point? Both she and Isaac died a horrible, undeserved death, to be sure. But in a season that never even tried to build a relationship between her character and the audience, the emotions the writers try to wring out of us barely amount to anything at all. Eden might have served to show that you really can find love in a hopeless place, despite terrible consequences (“I think in this place you grab love wherever you can find it,” June whispered to her, no doubt solidifying Eden’s decision to run away), but wasn’t that what June and Nick’s relationship was meant to do? She might have been a plot device to thaw Serena’s heart, the pious pseudo-companion who embodied everything Serena wished June to be: dutiful, compliant, meek. After all, besides Eden’s mother, Serena looked the most devastated during and after her execution. But then, isn’t baby Nicole doing that well enough? Or maybe she’s meant to push Nick (Max Minghella) into some much needed character development. Based on Minghella’s lackluster performance, however, even that is hard to imagine. (Seriously, especially when juxtaposed with the remaining actors’ stellar performances, Minghella’s sticks out like a sore thumb.)
What’s more, as in “The Last Ceremony,” June gets a brief reunion with her daughter and is even allowed to breastfeed her for the first time when Serena allows her to. One could ascribe it to a mother’s desperation—Serena even tried breastfeeding Baby Nicole herself—or a change of heart set in motion by her grief over Eden’s death. But for a woman who held down her heavily pregnant, forced surrogate while her husband raped her in order to induce labor; who taunted said surrogate with the cruelest glimpse at the daughter she hadn’t seen in three years as a warning; who wouldn’t even let her touch the child she had just given birth to, it doesn’t fit in with the image the writers have painted of Serena. In a season full of inconsistencies, the bar is not set high for where the finale may take us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I fell in love, before my first crush and eons before my first girlfriend, with dinosaurs.
Growing up, one of my tios had a shelf packed with DVDs that was taller than I was for most of my childhood. One afternoon at his house, I watched the 1993 “Jurassic Park” film for the first time. My brother and I loved the animated, talking DNA strand, and we’d burst into giggles every time it came on screen. The filmed intrigued and thrilled us, and for me, was one of my first real obsessions, one that’s been difficult to shake.
One year, I received a box of plastic dinosaurs as a Christmas gift. Slowly, I lost the figures—some were accidently left behind in a park or relative’s house, others handled so often that their paint faded. I discovered the novel the movie was based on and fell madly in love all over again. When I was in high school, I bought a “Jurassic Park” graphic t-shirt that I wore until there were holes around the collar.
Last week, I watched the latest Jurassic Park film with my shirt collar over my mouth and my fingers clenched for most of the film. The thrill I felt more than a decade ago found a new life: a new, genetically engineered raptor trained to kill, an island facing an existential volcanic eruption, and a multimillion dollar network of illegal dinosaur smuggling.
And yet, one of the most shocking surprises in “Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom” are the two supporting characters of color who are depicted as real, honest-to-god human beings.
The Jurassic Park series itself has often struggled with issues of representation. Isla Nublar, the setting of Jurassic Park, is a fictional island off the coast of Costa Rica. In one of the opening scenes of the 1993 film, two characters meet in a small, undeveloped beachside town which a subtitle identified as San José, Costa Rica. The only problem is that San José—the nation’s urban capital—is nowhere near an ocean. And though the films take place in Costa Rica, one of the only depictions of Costa Ricans is of them as members of a support crew in the opening scene, one of whom is devoured by a velociraptor.
Thus two characters in the latest film—Zia Rodriguez, who is Latina, and Franklin Webb, who is black—feel like a breath of fresh air. Both are employees at the Dinosaur Protection Group before they embark on a trip to Isla Nublar that goes incredibly wrong. They both bring expertise to the expedition—Zia as a paleo veterinarian able to keep injured dinosaurs alive and Franklin as a computer whiz who revives an abandoned park system. Refreshingly, they are two educated, crafty protagonists who play a central role in the movie’s plot.
Moviegoers are so used to flat black and Latinx characters molded out of nothing more than stereotypes, yet Franklin and Zia are not. For people like me—a Latino boy whose devotion to the Jurassic Park franchise has yet to waver—their inclusion feels like a long-awaited reminder that I exist.
Though perhaps the casting is a minor gesture, it carries more weight because of how white science fiction is. A 2016 report found that less than two percent of science fiction stories published in 2015 were written by black writers. As scholar André M. Carrington puts it, “speculative fiction is just as rooted in white supremacy as any other genre.” Zia and Franklin feel like the beginning to a shift in the overwhelming whiteness of the genre. Science fiction was formative, even though it pretended I didn’t exist.
As a child growing up in an immigrant household, science fiction dictated the trajectory of my life. I devoured books about dinosaurs and created a mental catalogue of their names and time periods, a skill that came in handy during an argument last year about whether or not pterodactyls are taxonomically dinosaurs. (They are not.)
Michael Crichton novels were one of the reasons I came to adore reading and writing. I discovered science fiction by authors of color in college, and it expanded the genre’s capacity to work through some of society’s gravest ills.
Through George C. Wolfe’s “Git on Board,” which presents the transatlantic slave trade as a fantastical plane ride, I learned to grapple with the harrowing legacies of slavery and how they continue to shape black lives. Carmen M. Machado’s short story collection “Her Body and Other Parties: Stories” helped me flesh out what it means to be a queer woman under the weight of patriarchy, such as when women are sewn into dresses to be sold to other women.
Though as a genre it often gets belittled and stripped of its intellectual depth, science fiction is so much more than entertainment. That’s precisely why, in many ways, “Jurassic Park” nursed the intellectual development that landed me at Harvard.
When I saw Zia and Franklin on screen, they told the kid I used to be that I too could be educated, politically-minded, helpful, needed, and incredibly intelligent. The current moment denies women, people of color, queer folk, and many, many others a less-than-full depiction of their humanity. There’s no reason science fiction has to as well.
Science fiction as a whole has been narrow in who and what it represents, and yet it still offered me the intellectual capacity to try understanding the world around me. If we gave young, black, and Latinx science fiction lovers more stories infused with their lived experiences, just imagine the worlds they’d help us build.

In many ways, reading “How to Be Black” by Baratunde R. Thurston ’99 is similar to listening to my alarm clock go off in the morning.
Unsparing in its lessons about race and persistent in its sardonic undertones, Thurston’s prose flashes across the page, prompting a level of alertness akin to my iPhone’s razor-edged sirens. Every sentence is a necessary rapping of knuckles at the door, offering a much-needed wake-up call in a world of denial.
Like an alarm clock, “How to Be Black” coaxes readers out of their nighttime delusions, pledging to teach them to open their eyes and dispel fictions of a post-racial, colorblind world. It calls for readers to come to terms with the contemporary status of race in an America rife with tokenism, internalized shame, and haphazard Band-Aids of diversity slapped on cavernous wounds of exclusion. It’s incisive, slicing away at ossified stereotypes perpetuated by even the most well-meaning among us. And like an alarm clock, it promises to awaken stubborn readers who insist on sliding under the covers and falling back asleep.
But in his book, Thurston also achieves what no alarm clock can ever profess to have induced: laughter.
Through a hysterical matter-of-factness that treads quietly beneath the narrator’s second-person voice, Thurston places “you” at the center of his book. But he does not berate “you” for your ignorance, nor does he blame “you” for societal injustices.
Rather, Thurston—through aptly-timed quips, witticisms, and outright jokes—makes you laugh, ultimately conveying critical lessons about race that would only slip through the cracks of formal didacticism. Whether it’s providing you with a tongue-in-cheek list of ten things to do during Black History Month, teaching you appropriate ways to “acquire a new black friend,” or offering you tips on how to “avoid being explicitly racist,” Thurston professes to instruct you and your fellow unsuspecting readers on self-improvement, yet does anything but preach. Instead, he lets hilarious yet profound anecdotes do most of the talking.
And perhaps that’s the key to what makes “How to Be Black” so effective: It’s unafraid to tug at the very seams of humor eschewed by many of its counterparts. By carefully treading the fine line between the gravity of a sensitive subject and the levity of its portrayal, Thurston’s book is part of a canon of comedic nonfiction that encourages its readers to laugh, with the ultimate goal of enhancing their self-awareness. In pursuit of opening the eyes, minds, and hearts of even the most obstinate readers and encouraging them to embrace a thorny subject that has pervaded national discourse for decades, “How to Be Black” does the unthinkable: It tickles.
In a world that often feels like the emotional amalgam of stubbed toes, slapped wrists, and slammed doors, it’s easy to feel snubbed. Today, countless conversations about sensitive subjects end prematurely, chased into silence not by a mutual inability to agree, but rather, by a mutual inability to understand.
But understanding one another does not require ideological consensus—it requires access to conversation. And laughter—for all its simplicity—has the power to build the foundational notion of trust that gives rise to the most vibrant dialogue. While impassioned moralizing is often a hit-or-miss approach to sparking reflection among a diverse group of readers, the careful use of humor to underscore social problems has a universal, enduring impact, giving rise to the contagious effect of laughter and allowing an audience to let its guard down. In doing so, it paves the way for compassion, sprouting the very seeds of empathy that anger repeatedly fails to do.
Some write off humor as a meaningless distraction, claiming that it undermines the solemnity of contentious issues, turning them into opportunities for cavalier jokes and ill-timed chuckles. And indeed, some types of humor are guilty of doing just this. But when wielded appropriately, humor maintains the gravity of a sensitive subject, while providing much-needed breathing room for honest reflection. Humor is the aloof reader’s loyal page-turner.
By harnessing the boundless potential of laughter in order to engage others in constructive dialogue, we can learn to forge foundations that have been largely absent from contemporary discourse. We can learn to extend a hand to a challenger, invite them inside the walls of our own lived experiences. We can learn to soften the divisive barriers of mistrust often present in difficult conversations.
When we line our most raw opinions with a careful glaze of humor, we allow its impact to reach beyond traditional expanses, ultimately resounding within the hearts of even the most resistant among us. In doing so, we allow them to take on a more fresh, accessible form—one that nurtures genuine interest and empathy from others.
And above all, we allow ourselves to indulge in a core human reaction, one that’s been largely lost in the silence of misunderstanding: a well-deserved belly-laugh, all in the name of dialogue.

If you told Courtney S. Blair ’19 she couldn’t do something, she wasn’t discouraged. She was determined to prove you wrong.
“She was a ceiling breaker, she was somebody who lifted up others as she climbed, she just defied the odds in every imaginable way,” her brother Everton L. “E.J.” Blair ’13 said. “If you told her something couldn’t be done, she was going to prove to you after the fact that it could be done, after she had done it.”
Blair’s perseverance and leadership made the Dunster House senior—who died Friday—a role model in every community she was a part of, friends and family said. They praised her ability to excel on campus and beyond, all while remaining a humble, generous, and supportive friend.
Emily Corrigan ’19 wrote in an email that Blair’s “warmth and the enormous capacity of her loving heart” made her a compassionate friend and a “really strong role model for a lot of people.”
“She was so earnest and in conversation she always seemed not only to listen but also to deeply consider,” Corrigan wrote. “She was open to everyone and had a smile that could make people feel instantly comfortable talking to her.”
Blair’s focus on others extended to the professional sphere, too. Blair “had a really strong vision of increasing access to leadership both for herself and for others,” E.J. said.
“We would talk about life plans, what kind of Fortune 500 company we were going to found together, how we were going to take over the world together, what good we wanted to see and impact we wanted to leave on the earth together,” he said. “She was gonna do it.”
E.J. said he is confident his sister would have achieved this goal because she had a long history of accomplishing exactly what she set out to do. In high school, she lettered in four varsity sports, served as a “really active student leader” in her community, and graduated salutatorian of her high school class, he said.
She “showed that all things can be done at the same time,” he said.
In college, too, Courtney continued doing “all things.” An Economics concentrator, she worked at the Harvard Shop, participated in the boxing club, tutored students in economics and statistics, and was as a member of the Spee Club. Last summer, she earned an internship with Boston Consulting Group—a position rarely given to rising juniors—and returned to that job this summer.
Despite Courtney’s accomplishments on campus, though, some of her most impressive achievements are not items you’d see on her resume, friends and family said.
Courtney’s compassion for others and her “loyal and caring” attitude made her the type of person who wanted to support and encourage her friends “no matter what the occasion,” Nicole Nishizawa ’19 said.
“Regardless of the time of day, her own workload, or even her own plans, she would drop everything to be there, and it wasn’t the sort of ‘be there’ that feels slightly like a friend obligation, but rather a genuine desire on her part to spend time with you,” she said.
It swiftly became clear Courtney was a caring and devoted friend even in short conversations and encounters, Corrigan said.
“Running into Courtney unexpectedly wasn't like running into other people,” Corrigan said. “She had a way of seeming so genuinely happy to see you that it would really change your day.”
Nishizawa, too, said one of Courtney’s most remarkable qualities was her ability to make “in-between moments” special.
“It could be a party or a Zipcar ride to Burger King or just walking down to brain break,” Nishizawa said. “To her, nothing was more precious and valued than time spent with the people she loved, and I think those little in-between moments are the ones that we’ll miss the most.”
Blair’s family is planning a service to celebrate her life in Georgia this weekend.

Amnesty International’s former Secretary General Shalil Shetty will be joining the Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy as a senior fellow in the upcoming academic year, according to a Friday press release.
Shetty served as Amnesty International’s eighth secretary general from 2010 to July 2018. Amnesty International is a human rights non-governmental organization founded in 1961 that draws attention to abuses of human rights and international law around the world.
Carr Center Faculty Director Mathias Risse said Shetty’s experience as the leader of Amnesty International is a “match made in heaven” for the center, whose mission is rooted in researching human rights globally.
"Amnesty International is one of the most visible and most important NGO's in the human rights field,” Risse said. “Human rights is what they do.”
“We are a prominent center for human rights, so it just struck immediately as a match made in heaven, especially in light of the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that will be in December,” he said.
Shetty’s decision as secretary general to decentralize Amnesty International by opening various offices outside of their London headquarters led to criticism by the organization’s staff—many of whom were forced to move abroad to developing nations.
Risse, however, praised Shetty’s leadership and said his restructuring of Amnesty International was an appealing decision for the Carr Center.
“[Shetty] has greatly built the organizational presence of [Amnesty International] in the Global South,” Risse said. “One thing that we are very interested in in the Carr Center… is to highlight and emphasize the importance of the Global South for the development of human rights, to emphasize that the Global South is not just a place where human rights were received and where people benefited from the human rights movement but where people also have actively contributed to those.”
Risse also pointed to Amnesty International’s pioneering use of artificial intelligence as of “special interest” to the Carr Center in the upcoming year.
Shetty said in the press release that his upcoming term at the Kennedy School is an “exciting new opportunity for him.”
“It is a great honor to return to the Harvard University community this fall as a senior fellow," Shetty said.
“Most of the challenges we face nationally and globally are rooted in the lack of accountable governance,” he said. “I look forward to joining the Carr Center and benefit from the rich intellectual resources of Harvard Kennedy School in our collective search for solutions.”
