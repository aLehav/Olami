After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard Divinity School buzzed with discussion and excitement Friday as dozens of alumni and affiliates flocked to Cambridge to celebrate the launch of the school’s capital campaign, which aims to raise $50 million and is part of the University-wide fundraising drive that began last September.
The $50 million target of the Divinity School, which is Harvard’s second smallest school, represents less than 1 percent of the University’s $6.5 billion fundraising goal, the most ambitious in Harvard’s history. It is also only a $5 million increase from the school’s goal during the last University capital campaign, which ran from 1994-1999.
According to the Divinity School’s campaign website, its goals include promoting the study of global religion through the establishment of at least five new professorships in international religious fields and a dean’s fund fueling for new cross-disciplinary collaborations, field education, and other initiatives. The campaign also aims to fund the renovation of Andover Hall, as well as bolster financial aid.
After a Tibetan prayer bowl ringed in the day’s events, a group of professors, doctors, humanitarians, and administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust and Pusey Minister Jonathan L. Walton, gathered to discuss the role that the Divinity School plays in the University and the world at large.
“Harvard’s history has always been linked with religion, mostly for good, sometimes for ill,” said Divinity School Dean David. N. Hempton, adding that “the Divinity School has been extraordinarily influential in shaping discussion about religion, heritage, and culture.”
In his remarks, Hempton said that although transcendental questions are often ignored, the world needs leaders who can think deeply about larger questions of human existence. Harvard’s goal of providing a liberal arts education calls for an institution like the Divinity School, he said.
“The study of the humanities is inadequate without an understanding of lived religion,” Hempton said.
Susan S. Swartz, a campaign co-chair and humanitarian who, with her husband, gave a $10 million gift to the school last year, said that the world needs the Divinity School. Divinity School graduate Thomas M. Chappell will serve as campaign co-chair, while Business School alumnus John L. Whitehead will be the honorary campaign chair.
After a series of discussions and panels that featured various Divinity School graduates from a range of career fields, attendees headed to Northwest Labs for the second portion of the event. Though the rain outside dampened many, a guided arrangement of Chinese lanterns and Divinity School trumpeters welcomed attendees to a reception.
At the reception, Walton spoke about the growing importance of the Divinity School and the continuing support that Faust has shown for the school. At one point, he joked that an appropriate nickname for Faust could be “Divinity Drew,” because of what he called her deep understanding of the importance of the school.
Faust said that since the founding of Harvard in 1636, members of the community have always shared in a spirit of free inquiry about humanity and the nature of meaning.
“Harvard began not as a Divinity School, but a school mindful of divinity,” she said.
Despite its size, Faust said that the Divinity School still has a dramatic impact on Harvard.
“Veritas is not value neutral…. We need the Divinity School, and the extraordinary community it makes,” Faust said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Penn State (18-6, 9-1 EIVA) all but wrapped up the regular season EIVA title on Friday night, beating No. 12 Harvard (12-7, 8-3) in straight sets. Winning the regular season crown would net the No. 15 Nittany Lions the top seed in the playoffs and the right to host the tournament.
Despite only lasting three sets, the match was close throughout, with each game a tightly fought affair. Remarkably, the Crimson had a higher hitting percentage on the night.
The win avenges Harvard’s 2013 defeat of Penn State, which has controlled the conference of late. Last season’s triumph was the Crimson’s first in the teams’ shared history. After Friday night, the historical record now reads 9-1 in the Nittany Lions’ favor.
“I thought we passed a lot better than when we came here last year,” said Penn State assistant coach Jay Hosack. “The thing Harvard does really well in this gym is be very aggressive, and I thought last year our passing suffered a little bit. But this year, we did a much better job controlling them. I also think our hitters did a nice job of moving around a fair bit. The combination of those two things helped us out today.”
Control was a key factor throughout the match. While the Crimson offense often only had one chance to close out a point, its defense was unable to gain back possession. The Penn State hitters were extremely effective at forcing Harvard into digging the ball back, spiking the ball and converting well-placed and powerful kills.
Despite this, a strong hitting performance by the home team kept it in the game. Junior DJ White and co-captain Nick Madden led the offense with 11 and 10 kills, respectively, and the squad as a whole hit with a credible efficiency of .348.
Every game came down to the wire, but even with a large fan turnout, the Nittany Lions crept over the finish line first. In the opening game, the Crimson brought the score to 24-23 after being down, 20-16, but redshirt junior Nick Goodell, who led both teams with 16 kills on the day, ended the set with a smash from the outside. In the second, it was 23-23 before two costly errors by White gave the set away.
The third frame saw Harvard compete and jump out to a 14-8 lead before eventually falling, 25-22.
The match was a tale of missed opportunities for the Crimson, according to Harvard coach Brian Baise, who cited Penn State’s serving in particular as the difference between the two teams. Harvard had only one ace to the visitor’s four, in addition to giving up 15 points due to service errors.
“I think their serving for the most part [won the match],” Baise said. “They won too many points on their serve. We have to deal with them if we’re going to compete with them in the playoffs. We had opportunities in every part of the game, we just didn’t take them when we had them.”
Though the game went to the visitors, the intensity of the competition served as a reminder of how far the Crimson has come in the past few years. Penn State will be trying to win its 16th consecutive EIVA title three weeks from now, and could face a much stiffer challenge than in years past.
“I have been with Penn State now for five years, and the first couple of years, you had a few [Ivy] teams that were struggling historically,” Hosack said. “Brian Baise has done such a nice job here, Sam Shweisky has done such a nice job at Princeton, and those two programs have really shown…that they can really build something. We don’t overlook Harvard or Princeton anymore.”
While Penn State still has three games to go in EIVA play, it will be heavily favored in each contest and is now a strong favorite for the top seed. Hosack was grateful for that home court advantage, but still very wary of the threat that the Ivy teams might post in the postseason.
“Being at home is obviously a lot nicer than being on the road, that’s going to help us out a little bit,” Hosack said. “But you know, the next two teams are Harvard and Princeton. This tournament is turning into what we had hoped for all these years: it’s turning into a dogfight. It prepares us well for down the line, if we go down the line [to nationals].”

College students everywhere are scrambling to finish filing their taxes. If you haven’t started, then hop on the struggle bus, because the deadline is April 15. While we wish we could say that it’s a painless task, if it’s your first (or even second or third) time filing without your parents, it might go a bit more like this.
1. You resist getting Turbotax and laugh at the idea that you, a Harvard student, wouldn’t be able to do your own taxes. Of course you can!
2. You go online and look up “how to” guides. Then you realize that the IRS loves naming documents with numbers. Sigh.
3. Your eyes grow wide and tear up when you find out that taxpayers with incomes of $58,000 or less are eligible to file tax returns for free through the Free File Alliance. Whew, that was close—no pesky filing fees. Then you remember that as a student you might have additional tax forms that you can use to apply certain credits, like student loans.
4. As Turbotax says, “the more you learn about the tax system, the less stress you'll feel when filing your first tax forms.” Basically, doing your taxes becomes a fifth or sixth class. Oh, joy.
5. You procrastinate filling it out. You started out with good intentions, trying to find time between midterms and papers, but despite your best efforts these quickly engulfed your life.
6. You get credit for trying, right? Like a $100 deduction? Maybe?
7. You realize that you’re missing some documents. You panic and call all the people who might be able to help—your parents, their tax attorney, hey, let’s give the IRS office a crack! They can’t all be awful, right?
8. You seriously consider hiring someone to quickly do this for you. You cry because you can’t afford to.
9. You curse the heavens that you didn’t attend that tax workshop in the beginning of the semester.
 10. Do you really have to file these? Would they ever know? It could just be your little secret with the IRS. But then again, you don’t want to be dragged away and jailed for evading taxes, like these ancient Egyptians.
11. Miraculously, you finish with one day to spare. You knew you could do it. You think, "that was easy"—what were you so worried about?
12. Making it to the post office takes far more motivation and patience than you realized. Struggles.
12. Reflecting, you realize that this is just the beginning—as your finances get more complicated, doing your taxes turns into the mathematical equivalent of a yearly root canal. You’re in for the long haul.

Thursday night. A desperate time in the Lamont Café.
I had entered the Café with the express desire to escape the faint, but distinct smell of unwashed bodies that wafted from the first floor study room. There the semi-silence had been too oppressive, but in the café—I had figured—the buzz of conversation and the making of caramel-macchiatos would lull me into a fit of focus.
The instant I stepped into the Café it was apparent: An Ec10 p-set was due the next day, and the place was practically overrun. Groups of potential Econ concentrators milled about laptops open discussing the finer points of supply and demand and whatever else someone studying Econ would talk about. From the not-so-faint mutterings and cursing, it sounded as if Mankiw had created an especially difficult problem two on the p-set. Aside from the occasional outburst, the mood was almost jubilant, almost. There was laughter and I saw more than one croissant being split among friends. The time was eleven o’clock.
By 1 a.m., this feeling had died.
The semi-overachieving students had long since left the Café, having finished their p-sets. They had been replaced by the more desperate breed of scholars. These students had not even looked at the Ec p-set or simply had no clue what they were doing. Their small talk in between problems was decidedly less academic than the previous waves of students. “I would make a great trophy husband,” one insisted. “Or wife,” he added to an outburst of snorts from his group. The topic at another table was also on the subject of significant others. “I just want a boyfriend who will come give me a hug when I text him that my p-set is hard,” one girl whined. “No one will ever do that,” one of her friends assured her.
At 1:55 a.m., when the Café itself was about to close, there was a stampede to purchase the last of the night’s caffeine. Cries of “Hurry!” and “Quickly!” rang throughout the entire space as a line quickly formed. With the last coffee for the night in everyone’s hand, the mood in the Café dropped as people realized, once again, that they should have started their p-set before Friday morning.
When the faint sobbing began at 2:15 a.m., I decided that my time had come. I took my leave of the Café. The book check out of Lamont took a whole 30 seconds.
