After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’d never heard any of the Icelandic pop singer Björk’s music before a couple months ago, when her new single “the gate”(stylized in all low-caps) popped up in the New Releases page on my Spotify. And it seems like a large majority of other people my age have never heard of her either—according to the Doodle poll I sent out on the Pfoho open email list to which a grand total of 23 Pfohomies responded, 60.9% has never heard of her, 17.4% does not like her music, 17.4% likes her music, and 4.3% (1 respondent) thinks she’s “alright.”
I myself had heard of her before, but the main thing I knew from a random Google search a long time ago was that she wore a dress in the shape of a swan to the Oscars (and she even “laid” an egg on the red carpet!), and it became something of an iconic moment in fashion history, earning its own Wikipedia page. The swan dress is definitely one of her tamer outfits—she likes wearing outrageous floral masks that border on beautiful and creepy, enormous puffy wigs ranging a wild array of colors, and Alexander McQueen dresses inspired by a strange mix of technology and nature, which make her seem like she comes from a distant planet, and make some of Lady Gaga’s outfits look relatively normal. So I’d written her off as a kook, and I’d never gotten past her wacky visuals to bother to actually listen to her songs. I never imagined that I’d get so obsessed. I never thought “the gate” would truly be a gateway to her weird and wonderful musical world…
I actually am not all that crazy about “the gate.” It is a minimalistic track with a spooky wooden flute accompaniment and Björk’s typical freestyle vocals that sound more like whining and crying at times than singing. It was a little too formless and arrhythmic for me.
But I did get into a lot more into her older tracks like “Jóga,” “Hyperballad,” “Human Behavior,” “Pagan Poetry,” “Venus as a Boy.” The interesting thing about Björk’s music is that every track promises something fresh. Some tracks feature a strong rhythmic impulse from instruments that I can never identify, and some seem to lack any form at all. I read that Björk’s music sounds like a genre of its own because she is endlessly curious about an extremely wide range of musical styles.
But mostly it’s her voice that I’ve been so obsessed with. Björk is not afraid to let out shrieks and screams along with smooth, mellifluous, girlish singing that seems to glow. She indeed often tells how when she was a young girl, she would always write music in her head as she wandered outdoors through the otherworldly landscapes of her home country Iceland, where desolate plains are punctuated by tectonic rifts, sulfur-spouting geysers, and active volcanoes. Her music certainly sounds like that—wild, unpredictable, somewhere in between brutal and beautiful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2017, the release of Lorde’s sophomore album “Melodrama” after a three-year hiatus revived the relevance of the pop prodigy in the national spotlight—and on a personal level. “Pure Heroine” came out in the fall of my sophomore year of high school, and quickly became the soundtrack I listened to while I drove to school, showered, and did homework. I was dually fascinated by pop songs that didn’t sound like everything else on the radio and the girl who sang them. Only a few years older than me—the age of upperclassmen I admired—Lorde didn’t look like magazine cover girls and sang about familiar subjects: love, friendship, youth, hard feelings. Here are the Lorde tracks at the top of my playlist:
5. “Liability”The fifth track on “Melodrama” features pared-down vocals and piano backing, following the brightly-lit floors of “Green Light” and “Sober,” a heavily-electronic look at partying. In “Liability,” Lorde shines a light on the dark side of fame: “I know that it’s exciting / Running through the night, but / Every perfect summer’s / Eating me alive,” she sings. For an artist, having your art appreciated in the mainstream is gratifying, but it’s not without consequences. Behind the glitter, the red carpets, and designer gowns, there were gossip sites that ridiculed her style of dancing and Twitter trolls who used racially charged epithets to criticize her now ex-boyfriend. It’s one thing for seasoned public figures to deal with the toxic discourse of Hollywood gossip rags and fashion critics, but Lorde was only 16 when “Royals” debuted and her popularity skyrocketed internationally. That’s the age most of us learn to drive and daydream about prom, still learning about who we are and who we want to be. Fame is alienating, Lorde writes, and sometimes the only person who can understand, “the only love I haven’t screwed up,” is ourselves. But we’re also the hardest person to please, the “forest fire” of our own expectations. The chase of our ambition is like a slow dance, an act of courtship. It excites like new romance—but when the lights come on, “all that a stranger would see / Is one girl swaying alone / Stroking her cheek.”
4. “The Louvre”  The muted bass chords at the beginning of “The Louvre” sound like the beginning soundtrack notes for a film about teenage summer romance. “I overthink your punctuation use,” she stutters in the first verse. I imagine a girl fervently typing and retyping a text to her crush, then sending the screenshots to her friends for analysis: “Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do.” The love affair at the center of “The Louvre” is nothing great. She knows he’s not her type, but there’s something compelling about their “thing,” in all its ambiguity, the violence of her beating heart. “But we’re the greatest, / They’ll hang us in the Louvre,” Lorde sings. “Down the back, but who cares? / Still the Louvre.” Sure, it’s not the Mona Lisa or the Venus de Milo—not the kind of art that’ll get plastered on advertisements and pamphlets, or analyzed in textbooks. But who cares? It was memorable. It was magical when it happened.  
3. “The Love Club”While “Royals” deals more directly with the glorification of the elite, this track from Lorde’s first EP analyzes a new kind of aristocracy: adolescent cliques. The titular “Love Club” symbolizes acceptance and popularity, the kind sought by every anonymous, self-conscious kid eating alone in the cafeteria who imagines how “everything will glow” once they achieve status. But there’s something dark about these clubs, about “hanging out with the wicked kids,” Lorde points out: you’ll “forget your old address” and start to “feel severed from the people who watched you grow up.” And while we might think we left feelings of inadequacy and social exclusion back in the hallways of our high schools, the vestiges of these instincts linger even on Harvard’s campus—down to the unwittingly relevant terminology (“get punched for the love club”). Walk through the streets of the Square on Friday night, and you’ll hear muffled bass, see the neon lights flashing through dorm windows. There are parties we can’t get into and people who will never know our names. It’s not that all of us want membership in exclusive clubs, but it’s easy to be surrounded by friends and still feel completely alone. We know that the Love Club, with all its glow and allure, is partially an illusion—but isn’t there part of us that wants in?  
2. “Supercut”  “In my head, I play a supercut of us,” Lorde sings. The increasing popularity of YouTube and the accessibility of video-editing software saw the advent of the supercut: a collage of the most pertinent and compelling footage. There are supercuts of weather anchors fumbling onscreen, of cats doing funny things, of scenes in “Gossip Girl” where Chuck looks longingly at Blair. “Supercut,” in this way, is fundamentally millennial in its sensibilities. The relationship is not a scrapbook, not a collage, but a supercut: a phenomenon as fleeting and shallow as an Internet video. There are bad memories, of course, but editing the narrative means selectively including the right clips, remembering the relationship for its happy moments. It means second chances. “In my head, I do everything right,” she sings. “When you call, I’ll forgive and not fight.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could edit out all of our mistakes?
1. “400 Lux”The city in Indiana where I’m from is bordered, on all sides, by farmland. It’s flyover territory—the kind of patchwork brown and green usually seen only from 35,000-foot altitude, partially obscured by clouds. It’s the kind of city where highways stretch on and suburbia dominates: the routineness of backyards and, as Lorde sings in the chorus of “400 Lux,” neighborhoods “where the houses don’t change.” When the second track of “Pure Heroine” opens with the monotone of its long, synthesized note, I am suddenly sixteen again, driving through terrain that blurs into an unfocused color palette of grey and beige. The chords change, but that base note stays the same for all four minutes. It’s the sound of killing time: “We come around here all the time, / Got a lot to not do.” Hearing “400 Lux” is like seeing your youth in slow motion, a series of disconnected images: wrists draped over a steering wheel, orange juice bought by our friends, roads where the houses don’t change. And a car out front, waiting to take us away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many others, I am outraged by the egregious incidents of sexual misconduct made public recently through carefully documented journalism. I applaud the removal of many alleged perpetrators who have clearly abused their positions of power, often through force and even violence. I celebrate those who have stepped forward to call out sexual misconduct and demand changes in the degrading culture that has characterized working conditions for women in too many settings for too long.
However, I am concerned that in the recent rush to judgment, principles of basic fairness, differences between proven and merely alleged instances of misconduct, and important distinctions between different kinds of sexually charged conduct have too often been ignored. Similar problems plagued the imposition of new sexual harassment guidelines for colleges and universities by the administration of former President Barack Obama. I was involved in attempts to push back against those guidelines and to develop at Harvard Law School our own policies, better designed to balance the important values at stake.
My fairness concerns with the #MeToo phenomenon include the ready acceptance in many cases of anonymous complaints, and of claims made by women over conflicting claims by men, to terminate careers without any investigation of the facts. Some argue that women who speak out should simply always be believed. Others argue that if some innocent men must be sacrificed to the cause of larger justice, so be it. I find this deeply troubling. I do not contend that mini-trials should always be required before action can be taken. Sometimes the alleged conduct is so egregious, or alleged patterns so suspicious, that suspension is warranted while facts are determined. Sometimes allegations are demonstrably credible by virtue of independent evidence. But where facts are in doubt or conduct is subject to different interpretations, efforts must be made to investigate what actually happened and how the different parties understood the events.
I am also deeply troubled by over-expansive definitions of wrongful conduct. In the current climate, men are called out for actions ranging from requests for dates and hugs on the one hand to rape and other forced sexual contact on the other, as if all are the same and all warrant termination. I do not believe that all touching by a man in power is the same as touching that is clearly unwanted or the deliberate abuse of power to obtain sexual favors. I do not believe that all romantic and sexual overtures should be banned from the workplace, even between people on different hierarchical levels. Some recent cases involve peremptory dismissal for behavior that may involve nothing more than that. Women are not so weak as to need this kind of protection. Banning all such activity from the workplace would reduce the quality of life for everyone, including women.
The legal definition of sexual harassment in employment and education is a helpful guide to what sexual conduct should be the focus. It is illegal to engage in quid pro quo harassment, namely conditioning an employment or educational benefit on sexual favors. It is illegal also to create a “hostile environment” through unwelcome sexual advances that are severe or pervasive and that limit the victim’s ability to enjoy employment or educational opportunity. Objective standards apply, so the question is whether a reasonable person in the position of the alleged perpetrator or alleged victim would have thought the conduct was sexual harassment, not simply what the alleged victim subjectively felt.
Finally, I am concerned with the cynical exploitation of sexual harassment cases and related scapegoating of individuals. The #MeToo movement has helped demonstrate to the world the toxic level of sex discrimination and sexual misconduct that have characterized work life for too many women in business, entertainment, media, and government. Corporate and political leaders, who must have been at least generally aware of these problems, did little to address them until this moment of public shaming. Now they dismiss alleged perpetrators overnight, often with no regard for the facts but clearly with significant regard for their corporate reputations and electoral strategies.
All this puts real reform at risk. It undermines the legitimacy of action against serious sexual misconduct and abuse of power. It creates the potential for backfire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman year, I craved academic beauty. I wanted that elusive Harvard experience that we all look for, that feeling that overwhelms you, squeezes your shoulders and catches your breath all at once. I wanted the “aha” moment that proved to me that yes, learning is just like walking through an art museum. Learning is about appreciating and coming to understand knowledge as an art form.
To find this, I of course took a philosophy class. It took the lofty task of describing how free will and determinism can exist if a God-like being does. To help us imagine the possibilities, the professor placed us in an ice cream shop: As we tried to poke holes in compatibilist or monist reality, vanilla and chocolate chip became our bargaining chips.
Instead of asking if our intention—the thing that gives us will—is determined in and of itself, we ask, “What happens if the store only has vanilla and I want chocolate chip?” “What happens if I’ve never heard of chocolate chip?" someone shouts, hoping their fellow classmates understand them when they wonder whether free will exists when their options are taken away. We asked a lot of questions—waded knee deep in arguments about Napoleon and extra toppings—without asking much at all.
This was almost the beauty I wanted, but not quite. Something was off. The words we used to express ourselves in class were getting in the way of the concepts. Instead of focusing purely on the merits of soft determinism over free will, we were spending time picking the best flavor to represent obstacles in our argument.
Time and time again, words became placeholders. I mean this but say that. You understand this but answer that. We both agree on that, but never talk about this. We play musical chairs until the idea that we wanted to express goes around the circle without us ever having to get fingerprints on our intentions. Play it cool, play it safe, we tell ourselves. Place bets on black or red only and let the roulette spin. Don’t tell the man behind the ice cream counter what you really want, for fear that he already knows it.
I told myself that I wasn’t the type for these placeholder games. I was a no nonsense, tell-it-to-'em-straight kind of gal who was determined to see the art sans filter. Rough around the edges, not embarrassed to go for what I wanted or if it made others bleed in the process. I didn’t need to wainscot my conversation in waffle cones for it to be pretty.
But I was wrong. I cozied up to my newfound personal philosophy, dressed it up and took it for a spin. I showed it off to my friends in various outfits, asked them what they thought of each interpretation. Did they feel like monistic determinism best captured the human experience? If an omniscient being can predict your actions, does that complicate your free will? Can free will and determinism exist together as compatibilism? And—begrudgingly—if you’re a regular at the shop and the ice cream guy always gives you vanilla, does it even matter that you dreamed about chocolate chip the night before?
Unsurprisingly, people preferred talking about the nighttime chocolate chip escapades much more than monistic determinism.
And that’s when I found it. It wasn’t so much the hard facts but the expression of it, the words themselves—the ones we said aloud and alluded to in the spaces caught between our metaphors—that were beautiful. It was the way in which words were simultaneously the placeholder for a concept, the concept itself, and the passion for it that made me see learning as a piece of art.
The ice cream metaphor has since developed a mind of its own in my conversations. It’s been used to negotiate intention and desire, contemplate the balance between complacency and taking a risk for success, and—of course—free will and determinism. Now, if I realized that I preferred free will, then chocolate chip was my Mecca and I’d reach over the counter and scoop it out myself with my bare hands. Free will doesn’t argue with determinism; it now is both the ice cream choice and my cupped hands, melting. Coexisting.
Maybe compatibilism was always right there—just over the counter, sitting pretty.

Having blown off taking my science Gen Ed all throughout college, I thought it might be refreshing to attend a lecture on HIV with my friend for her class. As a Social Studies concentrator, I was surprised that, during a 30-minute introduction on the history of HIV, the disproportionate impact the HIV epidemic has on gay men and the immoral inaction of world leaders like Ronald and Nancy Reagan were not mentioned once.
My friend became visibly angry when the lecturer described her research in South Africa and attributed the HIV epidemic there to the mistakes of 14-year-old girls. For some reason, she told us, these girls were incapable of asking their partners to wear condoms. A violent culture against women was never discussed as a contributing factor to the crisis despite the fact that, in a study conducted by South Africa’s Medical Research Council, over 25% of South African men reported that they have committed rape at least once, and the current president Jacob Zuma was acquitted from a rape trial after telling the court that his accuser had dressed provocatively.
The lecturer capped off her presentation by demonstrating to us that people in the United States still get HIV, showing us a picture of Charlie Sheen. Forget the 1.2 million people in the United States, disproportionately people of color and gay men, that currently live with the disease: Once the straight, white star of "Two and a Half Men" has HIV, it is time to start paying attention.
My friend tells me that the blatant social unawareness exhibited in the HIV lecture was not an isolated instance within the Harvard science community. In another course that dealt with HIV, she was taught about the risks of HIV transmission via male-male and male-female sex. Transmission for female-female sex was completely ignored, erasing the experiences of women who have sex with women. In her Harvard-affiliated lab in Boston, a co-worker expressed her puzzlement that all the men in the lab had kids, but none of the women did. The possibility that the burden generally put on women to care for children might derail the women’s careers apparently did not occur to her.
Of course, scientists are susceptible to overlooking social realities outside of Harvard, too. But Harvard’s occasional contribution to such neglect is noteworthy because of Harvard’s self-identification as a world leader in both academic and social progress.
This aloofness from social realities—which is by no means ubiquitous but still frequent—can prevent science from doing its job. From the huge disparities in HIV rates across demographics to the striking gender gap in scientific disciplines, society is less safe and equitable when scientists do not engage with history, sociology, and politics. The “objectivity” that scientists defend in their work can sometimes serve as an illegitimate excuse for not engaging with their own blind spots.
For example, the debate on the gender gap in science is dominated by questions about cognitive and behavioral genetics (see former Harvard University President Lawrence H. Summer’s speech or “the Google memo”), even though scholarly works like Myths of Gender have long ago exposed the faultiness of much of the literature alleging inherent intellectual differences between men and women. More focus on gender-based barriers in the workplace—such as the lack of adequate family leave which disproportionately affects women—could help provide a more accurate explanation for such gender gaps.
Instead of relying too much on “objective” scientific studies to base their conclusions, some scientists—and people writ large—also need to become more cognizant of their biases. A 2013 Yale study showed that—when shown two identical applications—physicists, biologists, and chemists were more likely to hire a man and pay them $4,000 more on average. At Harvard, the Mathematics Department has come under fire for its extreme gender disparity and its unwelcoming environment for female students that has discouraged many women from taking its courses.
While math and science can certainly give us a better understanding of objective reality and advance social progress, the ways that people instrumentalize math and science cannot be divorced from their own biased purposes. It is this fact—that humans are animals of prejudice—that must always be kept in mind if science and its implementation are to become more effective and inclusive.
My hope is that, in an increasingly “post-truth” world, we work to avoid wielding a fallacious “objectivity” stripped of valuable insights from the social sciences.

BELMONT, MASS.— Members of the committee searching for Harvard’s next president convened secretly at the Belmont, Mass. home of a committee member Saturday, spending almost the whole day in private discussions as they prepare to make a final choice in the coming weeks.
The meeting—held at the home of Overseer and committee member Tracy P. Palandjian ’93—stretched for roughly seven hours, beginning around 10:30 a.m. and lasting until about 5:30 p.m. Crimson reporters identified at least three members of the search committee—David M. Rubenstein, Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67, and Susan L. Carney ’73—as they exited the meeting. Roughly a dozen total people left Palandjian’s house when darkness fell at the end of the day, sometimes sharing vehicles.
The committee—comprising all twelve members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—has been seeking a successor to University President Drew G. Faust since she announced over the summer she plans to step down in June 2018. Though committee members have repeatedly declined to discuss the search publicly, The Crimson reported in Dec. 2017 that the searchers had narrowed their shortlist of candidates to under 20 names.
The secret meeting comes nine months into the search for the University’s 29th president. In Harvard’s three most recent presidential searches, search committees started interviewing final contenders in late January or early February.
Twice over the course of the day Saturday, large SUVs with tinted windows pulled into Palandjian’s long, concrete driveway, making the turn past a green mailbox with a “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” balloon. The SUVs discharged their passengers out of sight of the road and remained by Palandjian’s house for roughly three hours before driving away.
The first SUV arrived around 10:30 a.m. and left around 1:30 p.m.; the second SUV arrived around 2:30 p.m and left at approximately 4:30 p.m, at least an hour before the rest of the attendees departed Belmont.
Senior fellow of the Corporation and search committee chair William F. Lee ’72 declined to comment on whether the committee interviewed candidates Saturday. He did not respond to a question asking about the identity of interviewees.
“Bill does not have a comment to offer at this time,” University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement on his behalf Monday.
Previous search committees often flew candidates to posh hotels and the workplaces of committee members to conduct later-stage interviews, usually with the full membership of the committee. Committees also used members’ homes for interviews; in the 1990-1991 search, the committee met with shortlist candidate Gerhard Casper for hours in then-committee member Hanna H. Gray’s Chicago mansion in February 1991.
Former search committee member Charles P. Slichter ’45—who chaired the search that resulted in the selection of former University President Neil L. Rudenstine—told The Crimson in 2001 that January is the month when Harvard search committees get “in the thick of things.”
“You have at least one person meet them firsthand, then possibly move to a stage where several of the people do,” Slichter said. “Then we worked down to a small number—four or five people—where almost all of us met with them.”
Those in attendance Saturday took measures to keep the meeting secret. When driving in and out of the building, several attendees covered parts of their faces with their hands or their clothing.
Multiple hired drivers declined to disclose the names of the individuals they were employed to chauffeur as they turned into Palandjian’s driveway. One, though—who arrived driving a Tesla—said he was in Belmont to pick up “Scott.” Scott A. Abell ’72, the president of the Board of Overseers, is one of the three Overseers who sits on the search committee.
Previous search committees often maintained tight security around their meetings. At times during the 2001 search, search committee staffers coordinated with hotel security staff to closely monitor reporters waiting outside committee meetings in high-end New York City hotels.
Throughout the day Saturday, a man wearing a red baseball cap and a grey Vineyard Vines t-shirt sat idle in a grey Ford Fusion near the entrance to Palandjian’s driveway and within 100 yards of Crimson reporters posted in the street. Lee declined to answer a question asking whether the man in the baseball cap was parked on the street for security reasons.
When asked what he was doing Saturday, the man repeatedly refused to answer.
“I’m just sitting here,” he said.
Roughly 15 minutes before the meeting appeared to disband, the man turned on his lights, made a three-point turn, and drove away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School graduates are increasingly choosing public service careers, and some credit their Harvard education with teaching them management skills applicable to nonprofit organizations and government.
Of the 937 total students who graduated from the Business School in 2017, four percent of graduates entered nonprofit or government sectors, according to the school's career office. The figure represents roughly double the number of graduates who chose those sectors in the class of 2016, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Matthew M. Segneri ’04, who received his MBA from the Business School in 2010 and is now the director of the school’s social enterprise initiative, said he has noticed that more graduates are considering entering politics.
“Over the last 12 to 18 months, I’ve had a number of conversations with folks and seen a real uptick in the number of people who are thinking about local, state, and federal office,” Segneri said.
Segneri said he thinks Business School alumni have always shown a strong commitment to civic engagement and public service. But recent alumni are choosing to get involved with public service earlier in their careers, he said.
“When you look at the prior generations of alumni there is more the tradition of learn, earn, and return—folks would go to school, have a successful traditional business career, and then later in life they would pursue public office or get deeply engaged in nonprofits and their communities," he said. "Today, there’s both an urgency and an understanding that it doesn’t have to be that way."
Timothy M. Keller, who graduated from HBS in 2005 and was elected the mayor of Albuquerque, N.M. last year, said he agrees that more business school graduates are seeking out public service earlier in their careers.
“In business school, what a lot of people do is say, ‘Oh, my second career is gonna be in public service. I’m gonna go into business, be successful, and then do public service,’” he said. “What’s different all of a sudden is that people are opting out early, and they’re like ‘I’m gonna do this right now’ because they’re upset about something or fired up and want to make a difference.”
Adem T. Bunkeddeko, who received his MBA in 2017, is one such graduate.
Bunkeddeko is currently running for Congress in New York’s Ninth Congressional District in Brooklyn. He did community work in Brooklyn before entering the Business School, and he has maintained his involvement on a local community board while attending Harvard.
“I felt compelled, given my background and given my education, to use the skills I learned at HBS to try to make a difference in the community I call home, Brooklyn,” he said.
Bunkeddeko, whose campaign focuses on housing, criminal justice, and immigration reform, said he believes his University education helps him most from a management standpoint.
“At HBS we’re trained as general managers. Understanding aspects of an organization, whether it be from the finance front or human capital, are important and useful skills that are actually quite lacking in public service today,” Bunkeddeko said.
Margaret W. Busse, a 2001 HBS graduate, has also chosen public service post-graduation. Busse is running for Massachusetts State Senate this year and said she has similarly found her business school education valuable to her public service work. After receiving her MBA, Busse worked at a strategy consulting firm for nonprofits.
She later got involved on the planning board of her town Acton, Massachusetts, and, for the past two years, she has served as associate director of the social enterprise initiative.
“Harvard Business School uses the case method almost exclusively in all of its classes, so what you’re doing every single day when you go into a class is you’re taking a real-world situation and you’re trying to figure out how to solve the problem,” Busse said. “It’s really that ability to solve real-world problems that is needed in government today, that is needed in nonprofits today, and anywhere where people are trying to make a difference.”
Another Business School graduate, Sarah R. Amico, is currently running to be lieutenant governor of Georgia. Amico said she believes the culture at the Business School naturally steers graduates towards careers in public service, whether that be through nonprofits or through public office.
“We were consistently reminded that you were going to have a world of opportunity in front of us and a tremendous amount of responsibility should go with that, and part of that responsibility is to leave the world better when you leave than it was when you entered,” she said.
Busse, along with several other graduates, said she thinks the spike in HBS graduates running for office is likely related to widespread dissatisfaction with the current political climate.
“I’m guessing a lot of people are feeling like me, frustrated with the current situation we have in politics today and feeling their skillset gives them a unique ability to help solve the problems we have right now,” Busse said.
Keller named a more specific factor: President Donald Trump.
“A big one has to be Trump. Whether you like him or not, he is motivating. You’re either motivated against him or you’re motivated for him,” Keller said. “I also do think there’s just something about the millennial group that they’re not going to wait around.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a time when many are accusing President Donald Trump of racial prejudice, University President Drew G. Faust issued a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday statement reaffirming the University’s commitment to equality and an open community.
She said this community should extend beyond Harvard’s campus to the nation at large.
“Martin Luther King Day is an opportunity for us all to reaffirm the values of justice and equality that define our nation and animate all we do at Harvard,” Faust wrote. “Now more than ever, it is our responsibility to continue his work and carry forward his legacy, at Harvard and beyond.”
Faust’s remarks come after Trump garnered national headlines for reportedly making vulgar, racially charged remarks on immigration in a White House meeting on Jan. 11. He directed his comments toward immigrants from Haiti and Africa during a discussion of a bipartisan deal to provide temporary status to certain immigrants. Trump reportedly asked legislators why the United States should accept immigrants from “shithole countries.”
Trump has since denied making those comments, but some meeting attendees dispute that claim.
In her statement Sunday, Faust emphasized the importance of making Harvard accessible to people from a range of countries and backgrounds in an effort to become a “more diverse and inclusive community.”
“We recognize that our excellence derives from our openness to the widest possible pool of talent and our commitment to  the full flourishing of all students, staff, and faculty, whatever their ethnicity, race, country of origin, gender, sexuality, economic circumstances, disability status or political perspective,” Faust wrote.
Faust has repeatedly emphasized the importance of American higher education remaining open to immigrants and international students. She has spoken out against Trump’s immigration policies, denouncing Trump’s Sept. 2017 decision to repeal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—an Obama-era program that allowed undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States—as “cruel.” Since then, Faust has continued advocacy for undocumented students by signing letters defending DACA and appearing on national television. Roughly 65 undocumented students currently attend the College.
In December, Faust continued her advocacy for immigrants by joining over two dozen University presidents in a coalition that pledges to support undocumented and international students on campuses across the United States. The alliance called on Congress to pass permanent legislation protecting undocumented students.
Protections for undocumented students from Congress, however, are still up in the air. A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily keep DACA protections on Tuesday and, on Saturday, U.S. immigration officials resumed accepting applications for the program. Trump, who declared on Sunday that he is “not a racist” amid controversy over his inflammatory comments, has tweeted that DACA is “probably dead,” continuing the debate in Congress over permanent legislation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The eyes of Harvard’s undocumented students are turned to Washington as lawmakers wrangle over a deal to protect undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.
The Trump administration announced in September it would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program—an Obama-era program that protected these “dreamers”—and set a March deadline for lawmakers to act before those protections expire. DACA protected approximately 790,000 youth, including many of the College’s 65 undocumented students.
Members of Congress from both parties have been in talks the past few weeks to work out a solution by Jan. 19, the deadline for a federal funding bill. Meanwhile, federal judge William H. Alsup, a graduate of the Law School, ruled on Tuesday that the Trump administration must allow previous DACA recipients to renew their status. On Saturday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced they would continue to accept renewal applications for DACA recipients.
The turmoil has left Harvard’s DACA recipients—and the advisers and administrators charged with counseling them—unsure how long their protections will last and puzzling over what course of action to take next.
Katie M. Derzon, the College’s fellow for undocumented students, said the fate of DACA is still not certain.
“As far as what the DACA ruling might mean, we are not yet sure, as it just happened,” Derzon wrote in an email Thursday.
Students also described how the unpredictability of Congress’s plans to address DACA has fueled their concerns about planning for the future.
“I’m very fearful of my future,” said Daishi M. Tanaka ’19, a co-director of Act on A Dream, a student organization advocating for undocumented students.
“I am a junior currently, and because I don’t know if I’ll have the permission to work, planning my future is kind of scattered everywhere,” Tanaka said. “So I think I face challenges very different than my Harvard peers.”
Amid the uncertainty, Act on a Dream members are planning for a life without DACA.
“We’ve been doing what we needed to do before DACA was a thing, and if it’s not going to be a thing anymore, then we’re going to figure out ways to make it work because that’s what we do,” Act on a Dream advocacy co-chair Bruno O. V. McCubbin ’19 said.
Jason Corral, the staff attorney at the Harvard Immigration Refugee and Clinical Program, said he is encouraging undocumented students to set up appointments with the clinic.
“We've been telling students to set up consultations with us so that we can assess whether they might be eligible for any potential relief beyond DACA,” Corral said. “We have open office hours where people can just drop in or set up an appointment during the week. We've been doing that over the course of the last year.”
The clinic has also set up a website with a frequently asked questions section that it updates as developments in Washington play out.
“We urge people to check that out and just stay in communication so we can help come up with a conclusion or a solution,” Corral said.
Both Harvard administrators and Act on a Dream members are pushing for more permanent immigration policy solutions.
University President Drew G. Faust, who has lobbied lawmakers to protect undocumented students for years, condemned Trump’s decision to end DACA as “cruel.” In December, Faust joined an alliance of more than two dozen other university presidents to call on Congress to pass legislation that would protect undocumented students.
Since the initial announcement of DACA’s termination in September, Act on a Dream members have been working on several initiatives intended to advocate for Harvard’s undocumented students.
“We’ve hosted and co-hosted various DACA phone calls to advocate for immigrant rights in various forms, and we are hosting a CAIR Conference, which stands for Collegiate Alliance for Immigration Reform,” Tanaka said.
The conference is set to take place at the end of February and will bring together immigrant rights organizations from various national college campuses to share strategies on how to best advocate for immigration reform, according to the Act on a Dream website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six new fellows—including journalists and authors, a Columbia journalism professor, technology experts, and the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission—will join the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy in spring 2018.
The fellows will study the intersection of technology and public policy, as well as issues like climate change and the divide between rural and urban America. The Shorenstein Center will also welcome a writer-in-residence to work on a writing project studying race relations.
The Shorenstein Center announced the new fellows in a press release last week. The honorees include Elizabeth Arnold, a former NPR Political Correspondent covering global warming; Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at think tank New America; Genevieve Roth, founding partner of a social impact agency involving women’s empowerment and media; and Sarah Smarsh, freelance journalist and author focusing on socioeconomic issues.
The Shorenstein Center also named Thomas E. Wheeler, the former chair of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017 under President Barack Obama, the Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy Fellow.
Hossein Derakhshan, an Iranian-Canadian writer and fellow with the MIT Media Lab who introduced blogs to Iran in the early 2000s, was chosen for the Entrepreneurship Fellows program, an initiative specifically meant for technology entrepreneurs. Derakhshan’s will study the sociopolitical influence of social media, how to counter algorithms that prioritize “popular” information within representative democracies, and the future of the news industry.
W. Jelani Cobb, a journalism professor at Columbia University, historian, and staff writer for The New Yorker, will join the fellows as a writer-in-residence. While at Harvard, he will be working on his new book about the 2015 shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C.
Cobb said he thinks it is “crucial” for professionals to participate in scholarship at institutions like the Shorenstein Center.
“There are often so many things going on at once that it’s hard to sit back and focus and concentrate on a single project,” Cobb said. “I think that’s crucial because it winds up being in those times when you can actually think deeply about something that you can do really important work.”
Many of the fellows, including Wheeler and Derakhshan, have an extensive background in technology. Following a December decision by the FCC to eliminate net neutrality, and in light of increasing privacy concerns in the internet age, fellows will inspect the relationship between innovation and media and how to respond to such changes through policy.
Ghosh, a former Facebook employee focusing on privacy and public policy, will examine public service-oriented technology. As a fellow at the think tank New America, he founded an initiative that sought to bring technology experts into “public interest-focused work.” He said he hopes to continue this work while at the Shorenstein Center.
“Shorenstein is particularly amazing because it brings together innovation around academia, public policy, [and] journalism,” Ghosh said.
Wheeler said his work involving technology and policy will form the focal point of his fellowship, adding that he hopes to study the political and governmental challenges created by new technologies.
“The Shorenstein Center is the platinum standards in terms of researching and thinking about the relationship of media and society in this new technological environment and so it makes it the place to be,” Wheeler said.

Mila Kunis, a Golden Globe-winning actress, will be the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2018 Woman of the Year.
Kunis is widely known for her roles in films like “Black Swan,” for which she received nominations for Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Screen Actors Guild, Golden Globe, and Critics Choice awards. The psychological thriller follows a ballerina as she becomes consumed by a rivalry for the lead role in “Swan Lake” that causes her to slip from reality.
The actress is also known for her roles in award-winning TV shows “That ’70s Show” and “Family Guy.”
The Hasty Pudding will honor Kunis on Jan. 25 with a parade she will lead through the streets of Cambridge. After, members of the Pudding will award Kunis the Pudding Pot in Farkas Hall. The event will be live-streamed on Facebook.
“We could not be more excited to give Mila Kunis our Woman of the Year award,” Anne T. McCreery ’19, Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ co-producer, said in a press release. “We have been watching her on both the big and small screen since we were young and can’t wait to celebrate her achievements in a truly unique and memorable way.”
“If she’s even half as fun as her character in ‘Bad Moms’ then we are sure it’s going to be a great time for all,” Pudding co-producer Hannah L. Needle ’19 said in the release.
The Pudding’s Woman of the Year award, established in 1951, recognizes women who make long-lasting contributions to the entertainment world. In earning the honor, Kunis joins ranks with the likes of Meryl Streep, Amy Poehler, Kerry Washington, Helen Mirren, and most recently Octavia Spencer, who was the 2017 Woman of the Year.
Upcoming appearances for Kunis include “The Spy Who Dumped Me,” to be released later this year, and “Amusement Park,” an animated film to be released in 2019.
The Pudding has yet to announce the 2018 Man of the Year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both wrestling dual meets this weekend were decided by one point, and the grapplers from Cambridge emerged from the fray with two victories. Besting two formidable opponents, the Crimson established a perfect start to its new year and to its dual season overall.
After a start to a season defined by competition in invitationals, the Harvard wrestling team (2-0) beat both Stanford (3-3, 1-0 Pac-12) and Maryland (3-8, 0-6 B1G) in tight contests that displayed the team’s mental and physical endurance, especially in later periods of matches.
“Obviously Stanford is a big one for us, being another big-time academic institution with wrestling,” senior captain Kanon Dean said. “That means a lot to us, going out there and getting after it with them. With Maryland, you have a Big Ten team; Big Ten is the pinnacle of the wrestling conferences, so whenever you get the chance to wrestle a team that represents that conference, you know that’s going to be top-level wrestling.”
HARVARD 22, MARYLAND 21
After the 157 pound weight class on Sunday, the Crimson was in a daunting 17-5 hole against the Terrapins. However, the team would not relent, finishing with an impressive four straight victories to take the 22-21 overall victory.
“In dual meets, there are only one or two matches in a day, and it’s really for the team, so every point matters,” junior Sam Goldman said. “I think that going in, everyone knew that regardless of how good the kid they were wrestling, everyone had to wrestle above their level a little bit and grab a couple of extra team points where it counted.”
In the 165 pound weight class, junior Peter Bearse responded strongly from a 2-0 deficit after the first period to win a 7-5 decision over Maryland sophomore Brendan Burnham, a triumph that proved to be the watershed moment of the meet and ignited the crowd in the third floor of the Malkin Athletic Center.
Senior captain Josef Johnson followed up Bearse’s victory with a resounding one of his own, obliterating sophomore Jahi Jones in a 27-7 decision in the 174 pound weight class in a technical fall win that gave the Crimson five team points.
In perhaps the biggest match of the day at the 197 pound weight class, senior Logan Kirby pinned his opponent, freshman Mansur Abdul-Malik, to give Harvard six team points and the lead. Senior Angus Cowell in the 285 pound weight class was able to hold off No. 6 wrestler in weight class senior Youssif Hemida to secure a major decision.
Goldman, who had a technical fall victory of his own, acknowledged the team’s ability to gain crucial points by extending leads.
“I think one of the biggest themes of the weekend was that we were going to out-condition and have a higher pace than the guys we were wrestling,” Goldman said. “I knew that if I kept the pressure on him, he would eventually break towards the end of the match. First period, he took a shot. I ended up stopping him and going behind, getting a takedown, and rode him on top a little bit. The deeper we got into the match, the more I could feel him giving up.”
HARVARD 21, STANFORD 20
At the end of all duels on Saturday, both the Crimson and the Cardinals were so evenly matched that the first, second, and third tiebreakers did not suffice to determine a winner. Based on the fourth criteria, which awards the team with the most turns on top, Harvard emerged victorious in a tightly contested 21-20 matchup against Stanford. The two teams had exactly the same number of team points, pins, technical falls, and accumulated individual scores.
“It was so even, and every single marginal effort by our guys was what really turned it,” Goldman said. “Guys getting over it in the third period, getting those last takedowns was really critical, so it was pretty good because everyone felt really good about it, and the whole team was involved in the win.”
Sophomore A.J. Jaffe epitomized this sentiment. With time waning in his bout against redshirt junior Isaiah Locsin, Jaffe pinned his opponent with one second remaining, giving the Crimson six team points. The fall gave Jaffe his fourth on the season and eighth of his career.
Sophomore Hunter Ladnier followed Jaffe with a dominating 17-0 fall of his own against Cardinal redshirt freshman Jake Barry, Ladnier’s second technical fall of the season.
Both Goldman and Dean won decisions of their own, Goldman 10-3 against Stanford freshman Anthony Le, and Dean 10-5 against freshman Judah Duhm. Although the Cardinals won the 197 and 285 duels, Harvard ultimately won by fourth criteria tie-break.
“I think we know that we have a pretty special and a special group of guys,” Goldman said. “These aren’t EIWA matches, so we start wrestling teams in our conference next weekend, and it’ll be really huge to take this momentum and avenge a couple of EIWA matches from last year ... and then hopefully garner postseason accolades for some individuals.”
Dean looks to continue the aggressive playstyle of his team moving forward into pivotal matchups.
“I think we’re looking to build off this style of extending our lead and constantly wrestling aggressively as we go into next week against Bucknell and F & M, both very winnable matches,” Dean said. “After that, it’s Cornell week, which is a huge week for us.”

Finishing up the second half of a road trip, Harvard women’s hockey headed to Ithaca, N.Y., to face old foes No. 6/6 Cornell. Cornell hadn’t lost at home rink Lynah since early November heading into the weekend matchup. In the Big Red, Harvard also faced an ECAC top-five goaltender in junior Marlène Boissonnault (1.96 GAA, .922% SV). Several things were on the line for the Crimson: remaining undefeated in Ivy League play, and snapping a two-game losing skid.
Cornell (11-6-1, 8-4 ECAC), however, handed the Crimson (8-7-1, 6-5-1) its first Ivy League loss on Saturday afternoon, in a 4-3 contest that went down to the last four minutes. Early in the second period, it appeared as though the Big Red had put the game away. Senior forward Brianna Veerman picked up the rebound on a shot from senior defender Sarah Knee, and beat Harvard sophomore netminder Beth Larcom glove-side to give Cornell the 4-1 lead. Larcom (2.56 GAA, .910% SV), normally the Crimson’s go-to goalie, was pulled in favor of freshman Becky Dutton.
“At that point we had nothing to lose,” said junior defender Kaitlin Tse.
Down by three, Harvard played a hard second frame that paid off four minutes after Veerman’s tally. Sophomore forward Kat Hughes backhanded the puck into a chaotic net from the slot at the 8:26 mark. The play underwent a lengthy review before the goal was conclusively awarded to Hughes, bringing her season total to a team-leading nine tallies.
“We knew it went in,” Tse said. “That was a momentum changer for us. We were like, ‘Okay, we got a second one, now let’s go get a third.’”
Hopes of a comeback were further fueled as, with 3:53 left in regulation, freshman forward Becca Gilmore went in alone on three Big Red players, and chipped the biscuit past Boissonnault to bring the Crimson within one. Gilmore also assisted on Harvard’s first goal, rookie blueliner Emma Buckles’s first career tally, in the first period. With her two apples on the night, Gilmore now leads the team with 17 points, and also has a team-leading six multi-point games.
“Everyone did their job,” said Tse of the comeback effort. “We played with speed and our forecheck was high-pressure.”
Nevertheless, the Crimson fell short, just as it had the night before at Colgate. Cornell dominated the last 20 minutes by a shot margin of 14-3, and Harvard just didn’t have the chance to wrest momentum away from the home team. Overall, that appeared to be the Crimson’s problem through the game. The Big Red peppered the net with shots and drew five penalties, ending with a power play efficiency of 20%. The lack of discipline on Harvard’s part was exacerbated by the fact that the team also went 0-for-2 on its own 5-on-4s. The team now hasn’t scored on the power play in its last three games and 14 opportunities.
“[In the last three minutes], we pulled the goalie, it was six-on-five,” Tse said. “We had good opportunities there....but the first period was definitely their game, and they capitalized on that.”
Apart from Veerman, Cornell’s goal-scorers were sophomore blueliner Jaime Bourbonnais, and forwards freshman Madlynne Mills and sophomore Kristin O’Neill. Mills’s power play notch gives her a team-leading 11 goals, while O’Neill’s shorthanded tally bumped her team-leading point total to 24, good for third in the ECAC.
The road ahead holds more ranked opponents. The Crimson next takes the ice against No. 2/2 Boston College, a team stacked with three of the country’s top-five point-getters, including freshman sensation Daryl Watts. Harvard will look to find solutions to top competition in the few days before it faces BC on Jan. 16.
“If we’re able to come out with the intensity we ended with and not get down early on, we’re going to be a tough team to play against,” Hughes said. “It was a really great weekend in terms of our energy as a group, but we just need to find a way to translate that into wins.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, excitement gripped the Harvard skiing team.
The Crimson had waited nearly 10 months for the start of the 2018 season. The team had pushed through fall conditioning, trained on roller skis, and practiced over winter break. On Saturday, Harvard skiers would finally set off at the Colby Carnival in Waterville, Maine.
But Mother Nature had other plans. Unseasonable rain hardened into ice. Officials decided that the course was too dangerous and cancelled Saturday competition.
“There was a lot of ice,” junior Lily Koffman said. “For a lot of the weekend, we didn’t know what was going to happen—whether there would be races today or yesterday. That was tough.”
Consolation came on Sunday, when race officials cleared out a 1.8-kilometer loop. On the women’s side, nordic contestants would make around three loops, while the men would make nearly six.
That was how the Crimson launched into 2018—skiing on thin ice.
Junior Nina Armstrong took advantage. Finishing in 16:31.5, Armstrong grabbed ninth place. She had landed in the top 10 only once before—last spring at the St. Lawrence Carnival Classic, when she placed seventh.
“My goal for the season, and I think a lot of our team’s goals this season, is to ski more aggressively,” Armstrong said. “I felt pretty good.”
Three other teammates made the top 50. Junior Hannah Hardenbergh broke out with a 16:43.7 race, good for 16th. Sophomore Tegan Thorley earned 33rd with a time of 17:06.1, while Senior Charlotte Cole earned 45th with a time of 17:34.7.
Sophomore Mackinley Fitzpatrick led the men’s team by sliding into 47th place. He crossed the finish line in 30:34.4. Sophomore William Rhatigan and senior Connor Green shoved past soon after for times of 30:50.2 and 30:51.5, respectively.
“It was tricky conditions,” Armstrong said. “Especially with this course, it was a lot of downhill and turning. Just taking those turns with speed and trying to carry speed really helped for the racing.”
As a team, Harvard tallied 216 points on Sunday. That total placed the Crimson eighth out of 13 competitors.
Team results are preliminary, however. Given the ice-shortened schedule, athletes competed in nordic events only. The Colby Carnival will pick up next weekend for alpine competition.
“I think the team did really well today for a first race,” Koffman said. “Our coaches and captains did a really good job of keeping us mentally focused and ready for anything.”
Perennial heavyweights Vermont and Dartmouth wrestled for first place. The Catamounts emerged with the slight edge, accumulating 490 points versus 486 for the Big Green.
The dominance started up top. In the men’s race, all three of the fastest skiers came from Vermont or Dartmouth. In the women’s race, two of the three fastest skiers did. The lone exception was Zane Fields from Colby. The hometown favorite won the men’s competition by more than 15 seconds.
From top to bottom, all competitors had to reckon with the multi-lap course. Especially in New England, college programs are used to that layout. When snow is scarce, race officials can hold long-distance events by having competitors circle the same trail over and over again.
This setup brings opportunities and drawbacks. A shorter course means that competitors can familiarize themselves with the bumps and grooves, identifying any rough spots. A shorter course also risks psychological fatigue.
Koffman mentioned another tradeoff.
“It can be difficult to pass if there’s a big group,” the junior said. “It can also be fun because you end up skiing with a lot of other people.”
Those “other people” are quite familiar to Harvard skiers. The Crimson competes against roughly the same competition every weekend. Consequently, this first weekend serves as a useful bellwether for the rest of the season.
Moreover, the icy difficulties may prepare Harvard for tough conditions later in the spring. Warmer temperatures only increase the likelihood of repeat circumstances—more rain, more ice, and more multi-lap courses. Getting race experience now in that environment may pay dividends in more high-stakes events.
“Every race, our goal is to go out, go as hard as we can, and leave it on the course,” Koffman said. “As a team, we’re definitely capable of sending a couple people to the NCAA championships. That’s always a team goal. That would be super-exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two undefeated records came to an end for the No. 2 Harvard men’s squash team this past weekend. One mark proved to be more considerable than the other, as it was initiated during the 2011-2012 season.
Feeding off its 9-0 sweep of No. 3 St. Lawrence on Thursday at the Murr Center, the Crimson (4-1, 2-1 Ivy) started off strongly against No. 15 Cornell (3-5, 0-3) in its first weekend road trip of the year. Just one day after strolling to an easy 9-0 win at the Belkin International Squash Courts in Ithaca, N.Y., however, Harvard suffered its first defeat of the 2017-2018 season at the hands of a fellow Ancient Eight competitor in No. 4 Columbia, 5-4.
“I thought it was a good performance against Cornell, everyone managed to play well even after the long journey,” freshman Adam Corcoran said. “The Columbia match was very close, could have gone either way. We knew they were a strong team and they just had the edge on the day.”
Led by senior Osama Khalifa, reigning CSA Individual National Champion and twice crowned Ivy League Player of the Year, the Lions (7-1, 3-0) claimed the program’s first ever victory against the Crimson while at home in the Dodge Fitness Center in New York, N.Y. Harvard had won the first eight matchups between the two schools with one of those triumphs coming in the form of a 5-4 conquest in the semifinals of last year’s National Championships.
“We knew going in that there weren’t going to be any easy matches,” sophomore Timmy Brownell said. “Columbia has had a target on us since the start of the season, and they came out really strong on their home courts. This match really shows how competitive the top teams are, and I think that’s a good thing for our league. Going forward, we’re going to learn from this result and come back stronger. There’s still a lot of squash to be played.”
COLUMBIA 5, HARVARD 4
The Crimson’s four victories on the day were interspersed throughout the three waves of match play, but two of those wins helped propel the squad to an early 2-1 lead after the first grouping completed competition. Corcoran and sophomore Sean Hughes helped build the advantage with the former claiming victory in three games, while the latter did so in five. The edge proved fleeting, however, as Columbia players triumphed over Brownell and senior Bradley Smith to pull even after the second wave, 3-3.
The heart of the lineup is where Harvard displayed its greatest strength on the day. To go along with Hughes’ victory, fellow co-captains Madhav Dhingra and David Ryan also bested their opponents. The trio competed at the third through fifth positions on the ladder for the Crimson with the easiest win coming from Dhingra at the No. 5 slot, 11-7, 11-7, 11-6.
With the match tied heading into the final pairings, pressure mounted for each of the players involved. Two of the three Harvard competitors, sophomore Saadeldin Abouaish and Ryan had contended in similarly close matches before, but freshman Julien Gosset was new to such an environment in a team setting on the college stage. According to Corcoran, however, he and the team’s other rookies were able to harness their focus in the moment.
“Both sets of fans were making a lot of noise so it could have been a difficult atmosphere [to play in], but I think we were able to deal with it and just focus on our own performances,” Corcoran said.
Gosset got himself into an early hole by losing the first two sets of his match against Lions sophomore Robin Mann, 11-4, 11-6. After recovering to take the third game easily, the Toronto, Ontario native faded towards the end of the fourth to end the bout. Ryan’s own four game win helped tally the Crimson’s fourth triumph of the day, while Abouaish took Khalifa to five games to set the final score of the match.
Although he had faced off against his fellow Cairo, Egypt, native two previous times in his career at the No. 1 position, Abouaish got off to a slow start against Khalifa. The senior took the first game, 11-3, but the rest of the match proved to be very contested.
The two competitors traded off the next three games to force a fifth set. But Khalifa made his stand near the conclusion of the final frame, with his triumph—11-3, 8-11, 11-9, 12-14, 11-9—helping to propel Columbia to its ultimate victory over Harvard. Abouaish’s record against Khalifa now stands at 1-2 with the sophomore having lost the last two matches in five-gamers.
“Saad fought really well throughout the match against a very difficult opponent,” Corcoran said. “He was attacking well and put Osama under a lot of pressure. He opened up the court a little too much at the end and Osama took his opportunities well to get the win.”
HARVARD 9, CORNELL 0
On Saturday, the Crimson fared much better against an overmatched Big Red side. Even with Harvard holding out Dhingra and Brownell to create more of a challenge for the squad, eight of the team’s nine players breezed to relatively routine wins over their Cornell competitors. Historically, the Crimson has dominated its Ancient Eight challenger from Ithaca, as it sports a 48-2 all-time record against the Big Red. 33 of those victories have come in similarly styled 9-0 sweeps.
In removing Brownell and Dhingra from the second and fifth positions, respectfully, Harvard played junior Alexi Gosset and senior Mandela Patrick at the eighth and ninth slots, while shifting the remaining members of the starting nine up the ladder.
For the elder Gosset, a 11-8, 11-2, 11-5 win over Cornell sophomore Jared Scherl represented his first of the season. The junior accumulated a 9-2 record last year playing primarily at the eighth and ninth positions on the ladder. Patrick’s victory, on the other hand, was his second of the campaign with the first coming as another three-game triumph in an earlier match against No. 22 MIT.
Junior Perry Hanson tacked the only game victory for Cornell on the day. He constructed points well early on to take the first against Hughes, 11-9. Hughes regrouped quickly, however, to comfortably take the final three games, 11-7, 11-7, 11-6.
