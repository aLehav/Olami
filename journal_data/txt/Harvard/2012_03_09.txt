After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today marks the last day of Women’s Week, an annual six-day series of events that aim to “celebrate women’s achievements” and explore the role of gender at Harvard and beyond. Co-sponsored by the Harvard College Women’s Center and The Seneca, Inc., Women’s Week offers a diverse array of programs related to womanhood at Harvard, in the United States, and abroad. Women’s week addresses a real need for visible discourse on gender at Harvard: while global feminist movements have been enormously successful in raising public consciousness of gender inequality and equalizing men and women in both the public and private spheres, it is undeniable that there still remain significant social barriers to the realization of full gender equality in the U.S. and abroad.
The admirable work of the organizers of Women’s Week is certainly not unprecedented—Harvard boasts a vibrant history of feminist activism that has resulted in meaningful gains for women of the Harvard community. In 1971, for example, a group of women occupied a Harvard-owned building in protest of gender inequality at the University and ultimately founded The Cambridge Women’s Center. Significantly, the protest commenced on March 8, International Women’s Day, which was also the date of Feminist Coming Out Day, a Women’s Week event that encouraged students to “come out” as feminists and showcase the diversity of voices that constitute the contemporary feminist movement. It is due in no small part to the work of feminist activism that Harvard has become and will continue to become a more female-affirming university.
Today, thanks to the work of the activists of the 1960s and 1970s, women at Harvard are supported in their endeavors and encouraged to succeed much more than they are in many parts of the country. Harvard women are also uniquely poised to become leaders in a huge diversity of fields and serve as role models to other women across the U.S.
Yet Harvard, as a microcosm of the United States at large, naturally retains many elements of its patriarchal history. Countering gender inequality is particularly challenging today because sexism tends to be expressed in subtler forms. Though female Harvard students are officially granted all of the same privileges and opportunities as male students, the barriers to gender equality are still many, in part because discrimination is much more social than institutional. The significant gender disparity among Undergraduate Council representatives and the continued influence of Harvard’s male-dominated Final Clubs, for example, are both indicative of an insidious form of sexism that cannot be eliminated by protesting institutional policies or appealing to Harvard administrators. In this way, though Women’s Week 2012’s awareness- and discussion-based events represent a kind of activism that is markedly different from that of protesters of the 1960s and 1970s, it can rightfully be understood as a continuation of the feminist activism that shaped Harvard’s history decades ago. Women’s Week’s events span a wide range of relevant and challenging topics—such as gender in children’s literature, succeeding in the workplace, gender in hip-hop, and the concept of virginity—and in doing so explore expectations and representations of women in all areas of society: in popular culture, in the public sphere, and in the private sphere.
Despite the remarkable success of the modern women’s movement, the issues of gender and gender inequality remain as important as ever, and the conversations that have been incited throughout Women’s Week will, we hope, continue to be addressed on Harvard’s campus every week of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yes, I know it’s a little late to comment on the One-State Conference. By now everyone from your roommate to the Israeli ambassador has added his or her voice to the cacophony. So if you want to stop here, that’s fine—trust me, I get it. But the topic is worth discussing at least one more time because, with the benefit of hindsight, it has become evident that while the debate surrounding the conference taught us little, the character of the debate taught us everything.
Being six thousand miles away prevented my attending the conference, so I will give the conference the benefit of the doubt and assume it rose above the destructive rhetoric used by its organizers on this page. Most of the debate on the conference revolved around two subjects: anti-Semitism and free speech. The Harvard Crimson Editorial Board and Harvard Students for Israel excellently explained those two issues in relation to the conference. However, these two issues are really peripheral to the main lesson from the conference’s hubbub—academia is a destructive force in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
For five decades, no world conflict has received nearly the disproportionate attention of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This attention manifests itself not only in United Nations Resolutions, but also in a remarkable abundance of academic scholarship, literature, conferences, symposiums, etc. But if there were any positive relationship between academic obsession and results on the ground, then Palestine would be the glaring anomaly. The remarkable quality and quantity of international resources dedicated to conflict resolution in Palestine demonstrates that sometimes more is less. And as the One State Conference indicates, there is no other field so dominated by experts without expertise.
Why have these endeavors been so futile? It is worth considering the causes of academia’s collective failure to be relevant and helpful.
Perhaps the failure cannot be placed on academia, especially when other fine explanations abound: The lack of balance between the two sides, the obsession with the “right to return,” and the failure of specific political actors are only a few among many. Nonetheless, in addition to those issues, universities and academic scholarship have tended to function more as echo chambers and less as a medium for genuine understanding and resolution. The central cause of this phenomenon is quite simple—no one rewards compromise and moderation. Being relevant in the field nearly requires selling out to one of the sides.
Ideally, academia in any sphere ought to facilitate dialogue toward compromise and away from violence. In this regard, many critics of the conference attacked it for its one-sided participants. That may be true, but it is hard to imagine a conference where the two academic sides would sit down and politely discuss real solutions.
One clear example of the destructive rhetoric utilized during the debate surrounding the One State Conference is the recurrence of false analogy. For instance, Alan M. Dershowitz asked us to consider this thought experiment: What would Harvard’s response be to a conference on the topic “Are the Palestinians Really a People?” Recommending a single state in Palestine cannot be equated to questioning the legitimacy of an ethnic identity. Additionally, proponents of the conference inappropriately compared Israel’s political climate with apartheid in South Africa multiple times, using “Desmond Tutu said so” as more or less infallible evidence.
In case there is still any doubt, the one-state solution is infeasible for multiple significant reasons—most obviously because the desires of the majority of the people in the region, in addition to its political leaders, make it a pipe dream. It is particularly unfortunate that the Kennedy School of Government, which ought to be a paragon of realism and compromise, was instead an arena for an idea that belonged in the Folklore and Mythology department.  And although this conference gathered a lot of attention from a variety of pundits, those who wield power in Israel and the Palestinian territories likely respond with a scoff—if there is a response at all.
With the future of the Arab world in deep uncertainty and tensions running high with Iran, the conference is not only tone-deaf but also myopic.
This One State Conference does not warrant a passionate conclusion. Its organizers were not remarkable visionaries bravely breaking barriers—as they no doubt perceive themselves to be. Nor are they rabid radicals or anti-Semites—as some over-enthusiastic pro-Israelites would like to convince us.
Let us diagnose this as another ivory tower issue: sound and fury signifying everything to the participants and nothing to the world. Academia has let itself become a tool for magnifying extremity instead of approaching compromise, and Palestine has been worse off for it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Newsweek published an article some months ago with the title, “How Dumb Are We?” It addressed the results of a twenty-question survey to 1000 American adults, testing their knowledge of basic American history and posing the same questions that immigrants must answer in order to become American citizens. The results were disappointing—and illuminating. Too many Americans don’t know basic American history and the circumstances, governing principles, and developments that have made our country what it is today. Such findings require national attention.
In 2006, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute administered surveys to 14,000 American students and, in 2008, to 2,500 adults, testing whether they knew much about basic American history, economics, world affairs and government. The results were dismal: every participant flunked the tests, but only the bright young minds at Harvard could muster a passing D+. The adult survey in 2008 revealed that those tested who admitted serving in public office scored five percentage points worse than the average American adult.
Based on these findings, Harvard students have urged me through our Institute of Politics Study Group topic “Why Study America?” to devise a test for federal candidates that will be modeled on the same immigrant citizenship test that foreigners seeking American citizenship must pass. We’re doing that together, hoping to create a fair obligation among those seeking public office to “prove” that they have the requisite knowledge about the American system that they propose to lead. It only seems reasonable that elected public officials should know at least as much as new immigrant citizens who pass our nation’s citizenship test. At a time when public approval ratings of Congress are at an all-time low, perhaps candidates will welcome the opportunity to assure voters that they possess the basic intellectual qualifications to hold public office. If candidates take the test, we hope they’ll publish the results, and if they don’t want to take the test, perhaps they’ll tell voters why or why not citizenship applicants should be required to take the test and they shouldn’t.
Of course, this is all undertaken with the goal that we have well-informed and knowledgeable public officials making major decisions on our behalf at the power centers of government. In an age of transparency, it’s not too much to ask that public officials be transparent about their fundamental knowledge of the American system of government. The public has a major stake in assuring that they do.
Harvard students also want the opportunity to affirm why this institution is a national educational leader. As the oldest university in America, and the one that has produced the greatest number of U.S. presidents (five), Harvard students should hardly be satisfied with being the only ones not to fail the ISI survey in 2006. A group of Harvard students, looking at a wide range of topics that test one’s knowledge of basic national history and government, are selecting some basic questions to randomly ask their fellow students this semester—Jay Leno-style. It will all be in good fun, but with a larger purpose—perhaps other universities will follow Harvard’s lead in replicating programs such as the Harvard Civics Program. This joint IOP-Phillips Brooks House Association program connects Harvard students with fifth graders in Boston to teach them more about the United States and its system of government. Harvard students are also tutoring foreign Harvard employees who are preparing to seek American citizenship to help them learn about the United States and the fundamentals of government.
Civics education should start early, helping students and incentivizing teachers to have a deeper appreciation for the roots of American freedom. The United States needs leaders who are knowledgeable about the principles of American governance—particularly citizenship rights and responsibilities—and be better prepared to perpetuate the ideals that have helped America prosper for over two centuries. Perpetuating American ideals, knowing our national story, and having leaders who know what our nation has endured will help us all gain a better perspective of where we’re headed in this new century. Our leaders, many of whom will come from Harvard in the coming years, will then be better prepared to lead our nation—and we citizens will be better prepared to follow.
So, watch for Harvard students and me around Harvard’s campus, armed with a camera and a microphone, and help uphold Harvard’s standard of excellence by knowing your civics! Harvard students will lead the way to help our nation become more civically literate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the southern neighborhoods of Beirut, far from the highways and glass towers that compose this cosmopolitan Mediterranean city’s downtown, sits the Palestinian refugee camp of Shatila. The camp is a towering complex of dilapidated apartment buildings, their concrete sides marred by bullet holes and mortar scars that speak to the decades of conflict the Palestinian people have endured.
Unlike in the Lebanese neighborhoods just beyond the refugee camps, the roads between apartment buildings here are only a few feet wide. This is because the street layout reflects the same paths that led between the tents when they were set down in 1948, when more than 700,000 Palestinian refugees were forced to flee their homeland and many found what should have been temporary housing in Lebanon. Most of the refugees expected to return soon to their homes in what is now Israel, a right guaranteed them under international law and United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194. Instead, they have lived nearly 64 years in a seemingly permanent state of poverty and dispossession, awaiting the day their right to return to their homes will be granted.
Since that time, many refugees have fought to return to their homeland, actively participating in movements for national liberation like the Palestinian Liberation Organization and others that reached a crescendo in the 1970s and 1980s. Many refugees have also looked to nonviolence, seeking to make their voices heard in Palestinian elections and other bureaucratic mechanisms. Most recently, on May 15, 2011, the 63rd anniversary of the founding of Israel, thousands of Palestinians in Lebanon, Jordan, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Syria marched to the border with Israel, reminding the world that they exist and that they must be recognized in any eventual solution to the conflict. When a few young people began throwing rocks and jumping the gates, the Israeli military opened fire on the crowds, killing around a dozen and injuring many, many more.
In May of last year, I had been teaching English in Shatila for two months and accompanied a group of my students to the border along with their families and thousands of others. Although their school was covered in maps of Palestine and they could recite with ease the villages in what is today Israel from whence they had come, they had never seen their homeland, a mere three-hour drive from Shatila. Palestine was for them an illusive dream, a land that they saw on the news but could not hope to ever approach themselves. When we reached the border with Israel that day, it was almost unreal to them, and I have little difficulty understanding why thousands marched towards the border, unable to return to the misery of the refugee camps when the verdant fields of the country their grandparents had been expelled from lay before them.
I had been standing in a group up the hill and at some distance from the border as I watched the scene unfold. It was with horror and confusion that we began to realize that the Israeli military had opened fire on the crowds of protesters who had approached the border, thwarting the potentially realizable dream of return that had captivated yet another generation of Palestinians.
Today, around 4.5 million Palestinians live as refugees, scattered across the Middle East. The one thing that unites all these refugees is their insistence on their right of return to their former homeland. Although Israel has since demolished the majority of Palestinian villages, a number still stand vacant. For many refugees, an acknowledgment of the right of return in principle and compensation for the loss of their homes would be enough, as a 2003 survey suggested. And still others hope to move to a future Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza if one were established.
Until now, however, Israel has stood in the way of these options, consistently rejecting the refugees’ right to return and suggesting that any acknowledgment of this right would be tantamount to the destruction of Israel as a “Jewish state” because it could lead to a Palestinian majority in Israel. A shifting ethnic majority is, of course, no problem for a truly democratic state. However, for one predicated on the dominance of a specific demographic, it is unthinkable.
Those who accuse supporters of the one state solution of opposing normalization are in fact, correct to a certain extent. If Israel is to remain a “Jewish state,” it will refuse to consider the possibility that Palestinian refugees have a right to return to the land that they were expelled from.
But the one state solution offers the possibility of a joint, democratic Israeli-Palestinian state. Unlike the current state of Israel, this state would not be predicated on one group’s majority status. At the very least, this option needs to be on the table because it is one of the few that allows for the possibility of the refugees becoming a part of a future resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The One State Conference hosted at Harvard last weekend helped initiate that dialogue in academic circles. It is with hope that I look forward to a future dialogue that takes into account the needs, ideas, and experiences of millions of Palestinian refugees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Housing Day always brings bells and whistles. Thanks to a piece of burned turkey bacon, residents of Matthews Hall heard one more whistle this Housing Day morning than they had expected.
At 7:40 a.m. on Thursday, Olivia M. Angiuli ’15 had just woken up when the fire alarm in Matthews began to blare, forcing residents to evacuate the building just as upperclassmen began to stream into the Yard to raucously deliver the news of the freshmen House assignments.
“My roommates and I were just confused,” Angiuli said. She surmised that perhaps the ringing was an intentional part of the Housing Day festivities: “I thought all the dorms’ fire alarms were going off to wake us up.”
But once she arrived outside to a Yard populated by polar bears, penguins, and a moose—but no freshmen—she realized that the evacuation was not planned. She later learned that the fire alarm had been accidently triggered by a Matthews proctor and several Peer Advising Fellows who had been cooking breakfast in the basement kitchen.
Although Angiuli said she was “a bit” worried that she and her fellow Matthews residents would have to receive their Housing Day letters outside in their pajamas, students were allowed to reenter Matthews by approximately 8 a.m., leaving plenty of time before housing letters were delivered.
Hundreds of upperclassmen gathered in Harvard Yard to partake in the annual Housing Day ritual of welcoming freshmen to their new upperclassmen Houses. The spirited upperclassmen brought House gear, full-body paint, boisterous cheers, mascots, and even pets on their morning romp around the freshman dorms.
James J. Yoon ’12, who ran around the Yard delivering letters with his fellow Currierites, said he thought his House “did a really good job of getting a lot of people to come out to the Yard to show a lot of enthusiasm.”
He added, “It was great weather, which was perfect for Housing Day.”
Yoon also said that he perceived a major shift this Housing Day since his freshman year, when getting “Quadded” was a cause of tears for many a newly inducted Quadlings.
“It’s nice to see that the freshmen have a more realistic understanding of how great Quad life can be,” Yoon said.
A few hours after receiving their letters, many freshmen proceeded to Annenberg for lunch, where they were greeted with a carnival-like atmosphere featuring music, games, and House-specific diversions.
Pforzheimer set up an inflatable bouncy castle; Lowell invited its new students to toss bean bags; and Leverett whipped bright green cotton candy.
Winthrop brought two small dogs, including a Welsh corgi named Chief.
When lunchtime began, Chief sported a lion costume, but by 1 p.m., he was no longer dressed as the Winthrop mascot.
“It got a little hot, so we took [the costume] off him,” Winthrop HoCo Co-chair Lauren E. Tiedemann ’13 said.
Inside Annenberg, upperclassmen stood on tables chanting, blowing whistles, and holding signs—one of which depicted the Mather tower next to the words “Erect Since 1970.”
The combined effect was “overwhelming,” said Daniel D. Lynch ’15, who donned his new Dunster muscle tank at lunch in Annenberg.
But despite the excitement of Housing Day, some students said they were disappointed by their Houses assignments.
Adam R. Hotchkiss ’15 and his seven blockmates had hoped to be placed in Adams or Eliot, but they were instead greeted by chanting Currier residents on Thursday morning.
Although Hotchkiss said he initially “had mixed feelings just because of the whole ‘Quadded’ reputation,” he said his visit to Currier on Thursday afternoon improved his spirits.
“Now I really can’t be complaining,” Hotchkiss said, praising the rooms and friendly residents.
Malcolm D. Grayson ’15 said he is “not happy” that he and his six blockmates were assigned to Dunster this morning.
“I heard it’s really bad,” Grayson said. “Most people were like, ‘You don’t want Dunster. You don’t want Dunster.’”
Grayson said that he will consider transferring to a new House for his junior year and that he hopes to live in DeWolfe rather than Dunster proper next year.
Michelle A. Chang ’15, another newly assigned Dunster resident, took a different approach to Housing Day. While she too said that her blocking group did not receive its first choice, she is optimistic about her future House life.
“I think everyone will learn to love their Houses, even if it takes a while,” Chang said. “You can be as happy as you want to be—your life in your House will be as happy as you make it.”
Even Grayson, despite his reservations about his Dunster, seemed to manage to find a silver lining in his new House.
“[My blockmates and I are] going to dinner tonight,” he said. “We heard the food’s good.”

History professor Lizabeth Cohen will serve as the next dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the University announced Thursday. Cohen, the current acting dean of the Institute, previously served as the chair of Harvard’s history department and the director of the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History.
“Liz Cohen is a distinguished and imaginative scholar with a deep knowledge of Radcliffe and Harvard and a strong dedication to Radcliffe’s pursuit of new ideas and collaborations across the academic disciplines, the professions, and the creative arts,” said University President Drew G. Faust in a statement. “As interim dean she has already strengthened Radcliffe’s ties to people and programs across Harvard and beyond.”
Faust previously served as Radcliffe dean herself before being named University president.
Cohen said that she hopes to encourage more undergraduate involvement and increase student attendance at Radcliffe events.
“I want to see Radcliffe fulfill its mission as this intellectual common space at Harvard,” she said.
Cohen added that she hopes Radcliffe will become “a hub that brings other hubs together and provides resources for faculty to also get to know scholars in other fields.”
Cohen said that she did not expect that her appointment would be permanent when she was first appointed interim dean.
“I really had no intention to continue in the job. I just thought I would be a good caretaker,” said Cohen. “But as the ten months have worn on...I have seen and begun to appreciate even more the magic of Radcliffe. When I was given the opportunity, I decided that I would very much like to do it.”
Radcliffe, which  maintains a focus on the study of women and gender, is an interdisciplinary institute that fosters academic studies in a number of different fields.
“The Radcliffe Institute was my first Harvard home,” Faust said in the statement. “I know from experience what an important role it has to play within and beyond the University.”
Cohen, a scholar of American history, joined the Harvard faculty in 1997. She is known for her work on twentieth century political, social, and cultural history.
“All of us in the History department are at the same time rejoicing for Radcliffe, proud of and happy for Liz, and feeling very sorry for ourselves because we’ll have to get along without her,” History Chair James T. Kloppenberg wrote in an email. “She is a superb choice for the job, a person with just the sort of high standards and impeccable judgment the position will require.”

High-performing teachers can change the trajectory of students born into low-income families, said Wendy Kopp, CEO and founder of Teach For America, at a panel discussion Thursday evening at the Graduate School of Education.
Kopp argued that TFA and other programs have changed the conventional wisdom that claimed a generation ago that socioeconomic background almost inevitably determined educational success.
Kopp was joined on the panel by three former participants in TFA, a program that employs recent graduates of top universities as teachers in needy classrooms.
“I was changed profoundly by the faces and stories and hearts of the little people I met in my classroom,” said Aaliyah S. El-Amin, a former TFA corps member who is now a teaching fellow in African and African American Studies at Harvard.
El-Amin, an alumna of TFA’s Atlanta corps, said that her teaching experience in a classroom which lacked even windows gave her a newfound sense of responsibility for helping underprivileged children.
Kopp addressed critics of TFA’s two-year program who argue that a revolving corps of teachers cannot bring about long-term changes to public education.
“I know we are not going to change the education system with people teaching for two years. That’s not what we are trying to do,” Kopp said.
Instead, Kopp said that TFA’s mission is to recruit enterprising college graduates who will contribute to the field of education even if they do not continue in the classroom.
“Twenty years ago, zillions of dollars were spent recruiting the next leaders to spend two years working in corporate America,” she said. “We started thinking, ‘Let’s spend zillions of dollars aggressively recruiting those people who will one day be running our country to channel their energy into something other than Wall Street.’”
Erasmo A. Montalván, another former TFA corps member, stressed the intensity of the organization’s corporate recruitment strategy.
“Recruiting is hard-core,” said Montalván, who is now a student at the Graduate School of Education. “There were more layers in between me applying and getting accepted to Teach For America than me applying and getting accepted to Harvard.”
After his time as a TFA corps member, Montalván said he has come to believe that the American education system places an unfair burden on teachers by failing to provide the training and resources that they need to succeed.
“[Many] teachers start every morning in every classroom already losing. They don’t have the support,” he said.
TFA helps address that problem, Kopp said, by providing schools with teachers who have the leadership and collaboration skills needed to successfully change the lives of underprivileged students.
“Our most successful teachers are spending an extraordinary amount of their energy on the kids and parents to get the parents invested in what they are trying to accomplish,” Kopp said. “There is no doubt in my mind that the most transformational teachers do this. That piece plays large in our initiative.”

Negative messages and mentions of racism clouded this year’s Student Government campaign at Harvard Law School. The student body ultimately elected Matthew P. Gelfand on Wednesday as president of the school’s Student Government—despite the fact that as a third-year student, he is set to graduate halfway through his one-year term.
Gelfand said that Student Government rules allow him to hold the position of president even after graduating but that he intends to step down at the end of this semester after making the reforms he promised during the election.
Despite his class year, he decided to enter the race after hearing that the field was narrow, he said. He thought that his chances were low.
“If you had asked me at the time whether I thought I would win, I would have said no,” Gelfand said. “As I asked people about the campaign, people became more interested in the message.”
In his candidate statement, Gelfand wrote that he hopes “to rewrite the HLS Student Government Constitution and Bylaws into reasonable documents constrained by rationality and common sense.” Among his proposed changes, he said he would like the government to disclose minutes from its meetings and seek student permission before changing the bylaws.
As Gelfand campaigned on these topics, tensions erupted between the campaigns of his opponents, Daniel B. Vargas and Rachna Shah.
Vargas said that he focused his campaign on diversity issues, transparency, and increased interaction between students in different Law School programs. In his campaign statement, he cited a Student Government policy that forbids the formation of organizations centered around national identity as one of his concerns regarding diversity.
“To truly fulfill its commitment to diversity, HLS should give voice and institutional support to students with new ideas to enrich the quality of our HLS experience,” read Vargas’ campaign literature. “However, Student Government has just approved a measure...that bars future student organizations based on state, national, or regional identity.”
In a widely distributed email, Shah, who served as vice president of the Student Government when this policy was put in place, responded to this criticism from Vargas and his running mate Judy Lai, along with others about the Government’s policies.
“I write to you today extremely, extremely saddened by how this campaign has developed. Otherwise meaningful discourse has devolved into accusations of discrimination and racist behavior,” Shah wrote in the email. “Vargas/Lai claim in their candidate statement that Student Government is ‘anti-diversity’ and has made these claims personal in addition to ‘discriminatory’ and ‘racist’ being used to describe my position.”
Vargas said that he never intended for his statement to be read as a “personal attack” and that he never used the word “racist.”
Shah and Andrew J. Chinsky, the vice presidential candidate on her ticket, could not be reached for comment.
Vargas said that although his ticket lost the election, he believes the Law School will benefit from the discussion of diversity.
“One of the accomplishments that will result from this campaign is to raise the level of the discussion,” Vargas said.

Elizabeth Childs, former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, announced Wednesday that she had earned the endorsement of four high-profile female politicians, buoying her campaign for the Republican nomination for Massachusetts’ Fourth Congressional District seat.
The endorsements came from former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry M. Healey ’82, former Massachusetts Republican Party Chair Jennifer A. Nassour, former Massachusetts Governor Jane M. Swift, and former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman.
“As a physician, public official and mother, Dr. Childs understands the challenges facing families across Massachusetts,” Swift said in a statement released by Childs’ campaign. “Rather than play the blame game, Dr. Childs works in bipartisan ways to find practical solutions in education, health care and public management of taxpayer dollars.”
Childs’ bid for a seat in the U.S. Congress has suffered from a lack of exposure from the outset, analysts said, but this week’s endorsements could help bolster support and generate much-needed cash for the struggling campaign.
“She’s a newcomer, and these endorsements help to make her a viable candidate, which is certainly objective number one for anyone running,” said Joseph D. Malone ’78, a Republican political strategist and former Congressional candidate.
Childs, a physician who lives in Brookline, headed the Department of Mental Health under former Governor Mitt Romney from 2003 to 2007. In 2006, she was appointed to the National Advisory Mental Health Council, a board consulted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health.
Childs faces Sean Bielat, a Marine Corps Reserve officer, for the Republican nomination. The winner will compete in the general election to fill the seat long held by retiring Representative Barney Frank ’61-’62.
Bielat ran against Frank two years ago; in that race, Frank survived with the tightest victory in nearly 20 years. Frank pulled about 54 percent of the vote to Bielat’s 43 percent.
Frank decide to retire after more than 30 years in office in the wake of redistricting that brought a large number of Republicans into his traditionally Democratic district.
Childs announced her bid for the Fourth Congressional seat in July 2011 but was eclipsed by Bielat and by Democrat Joseph P. Kennedy III, who announced his interest in the seat in January.
“Elizabeth Childs certainly has a good reason to feel pleased. However, this will be a long race, and Sean Bielat will get his endorsements,” Malone said. “I expect it will be a very competitive primary.”
Bielat is considered by most political analysts to be the frontrunner for the Republican nomination this time around, but a poll taken in January showed Kennedy with a two-to-one lead over Bielat.
Childs said that as an independent-minded Republican, she is better positioned to appeal to her district’s voters.
“I do think that I’m a real contrast with Sean Bielat and Joseph Kennedy, and the whole point of democracy is to give people options,” Childs said in an interview in late January. “Only voters can change the course of the country.... That’s why it’s the responsibility of people like me to give them choices.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting just behind first place in the giant slalom of the NCAA Championships, some athletes might have been nervous.
Harvard sophomore Rebecca Nadler was fired up.
“I think Rebecca is single-minded in purpose,” her father Steven  said. “When she makes up her mind, she’s going to do everything possible  to get there.”
And so Nadler did exactly what she did on the first run: execute the  race plan perfectly and lock up the first-ever national title by a  Crimson skier in the process.
“The number of congratulations we got from almost everyone there—the  number of congratulations I got—I’ve never seen anything to this  degree,” coach Tim Mitchell said. “People who have no connection to  Harvard skiing, people from competitor programs.... It’s probably one of  the coolest experiences I’ve ever had as a coach or competitor. I’ve  never seen anything like it. It was just absolutely amazing.”
The trip to Bridger Bowl in Bozeman, Mont., meant a sharp change in  conditions for the lifelong Easterner who grew up in Ottawa, Ont., and  skied for the Quebec provincial team and Maine’s Carrabassett Valley  Academy in her two years before Harvard. But Nadler had no trouble  adjusting to the softer snow of the west.
“You still want to ski very aggressively, but you also don’t want to  dig in too much,” Mitchell explained. “We made the[ski] edges a little  duller at the back end so the skis didn’t dig in and grind.”
The conditions also meant that Nadler had to let go of her aggressive  skiing style and focus on conquering the course rather than the  opposition.
“I can’t stress enough how well she executed,” Mitchell said. “It was  literally 100 percent, spot-on every turn. She completely, completely  nailed it. It’s kind of hard not to think about the win. To have the  focus and determination to remove yourself from focusing on the result  to focusing on the process...it was tremendous.”
“I was just trying to be patient and keep a good line, not jamming  the ski under the gate,” Nadler said. “I was trying to bring over the  things I’d been doing well in practice [like] having that long outside  leg.”
Nadler’s title was only the latest and greatest in what have been many firsts for the Crimson alpine ski team. Recently, Nadler gave Harvard its first EISA carnival win in an alpine event, and last year, she and then-sophomore Catherine
Sheils were the first Crimson alpine skiers ever to go to NCAAs.
At that event, Nadler was within striking distance of the EISA  individual points trophy, holding the lead heading into the championship  weekend when the University of Vermont’s Kate Ryley snatched it away.
Nadler exacted her retribution on Thursday by edging her new rival out by .38 seconds for the victory.
“She shares her successes but takes responsibility for her failures,”  Roanne Nadler said of her daughter. “She will just dig in and work a  little harder.”
“Rebecca has a favorite quote: ‘You can never fail until you stop trying,’” Steven added.
Nadler’s resilience has come in handy throughout her career, which  hasn’t always played out according to plan. Nadler didn’t come to  Carrabassett Valley Academy until her run at the Canadian national team  fell short. While competing for Carrabassett, she was a dark horse  candidate who wasn’t being recruited by the EISA ’s top dogs. Her  visibility increased when she won the Eastern Cup that winter.
At Harvard, Nadler has had her share of obstacles even beyond those  that come with the time strains of competing for a school from Boston.  After a promising start to her freshman season and a 21st place finish  at the World University Games, Nadler was hindered with illness and  injuries for much of her rookie campaign but was able to rally in time  for a 20th place finish in the giant slalom at the NCAA Championships.
This year Nadler simply took her skiing to a new level.
“Winning a national championship—it doesn’t get any bigger than that,” Mitchell said. “At the same time, it’s not unbelievable. I know what she’s capable of. I know how hard she works.” 
The victory secured Nadler’s place as the Crimson’s best skier ever.
“I’m just overall a mess with how happy I am,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team begins ECAC tournament play with a best-of-three quarterfinal against Yale. Should the Crimson advance, its reward is a one-game semifinal berth in Atlantic City on Mar. 16 to compete for a place in the final the following day.
As you may have noted, the usual format of postseason play—series that get longer as the rounds advance, like in MLB—is inverted here. Why, you ask? Perhaps the ECAC tournament organizers could only get away with two nights in Atlantic City before their wives got suspicious. Or maybe it’s just that Ivy sports have a bunch of stupid rules.
The reduction of the final two series to one game each introduces an element of luck that doesn’t exist in the previous rounds, diminishing the chance that the team that ultimately earns the conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament is, in fact, the conference’s best team. There’s something to be said for the excitement of Cinderella, but why do so only part of the time? Advantage, third-seed Harvard, but a defeat for logic.
In the women’s ECAC tournament, which follows the same set-up as the men, the Crimson was not so fortunate. After dispatching Princeton in two games in its best-of-three quarterfinal, Harvard faced off in the semifinal against St. Lawrence, a team it beat by a combined score of 13-2 in the teams’ two regular season meetings. Regulation ended with the two teams tied at one, and in overtime, the Saints struck first, advancing to the tournament final. Instead of being given a chance to equalize the series, the Crimson’s season was over. Despite losing to Cornell in the (one-game) final, St. Lawrence secured one of five at-large bids to the NCAA Tournament.
This isn’t quite as bad as other Ivy League regulations, which try to straddle the line between competitive athletics and highbrow tradition. Take football, for instance. Ivy teams compete in the Football Championship Subdivision in name only; the only championship they can compete for is the Ivy title. For the Ancient Eight, playoff football against the rest of the FCS is forbidden.
Let’s consider Princeton president Shirley Tilghman’s remarks on the matter in 2006, as a group of students at the university sought to overturn the ban: “If the focus of competition became postseason play, we would inevitably lose some of that great tradition [of Ivy football].” Of course! If, by some wicked contrivance, Ivy teams were forced to compete against the unwashed masses, their own self-importance might be devalued. Imagine the annual Brown-Dartmouth battle being cheapened in some way; the 250 alumni in attendance simply wouldn’t stand for it.
Never mind that our other 40 varsity sports are eligible for some form of postseason play; we invented this sport, and we’ll be damned if we have to fight for supremacy with the Appalachian States of the world. If you look for reason in your sports leagues, I encourage you to look elsewhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team set the NCAA record for ties this season, but this weekend, there will be no draws allowed.
Indeed, in the postseason, every game must end with a win or a loss, and in its ECAC quarterfinal series against Yale, the Crimson hopes it can pull out two of the former at Bright Hockey Center.
The Bulldogs, the No. 6 seed, are coming off a dramatic series win over Princeton last weekend. After beating the Tigers, 4-2, in game one, Yale (15-14-3, 10-10-2 ECAC) lost the second contest, 5-4, in overtime before finishing off Princeton, 7-3, in the third match to earn a trip to Cambridge.
Harvard (10-8-11, 8-5-9) enters the best-of-three series fresh off a first-round bye—its first in four years—thanks to a late-season push capped by a home sweep of St. Lawrence and Clarkson that made it the No. 3 seed in the conference.
The Crimson has received a recent spark from sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard. After taking the starting job from freshman Steve Michalek last month, Girard went 3-0-2 in seven February appearances in which he allowed just 1.75 goals per game and recorded a .944 save percentage.
“Raph’s been unbelievable lately,” junior forward Marshall Everson said. “With him playing solid, it just makes our whole game plan a lot easier.”
For his efforts, Girard was named the ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Month.
“I guess I just took advantage of my chance,” Girard said. “We needed big wins, and the guys played well in front of me.... It was a total team effort.”
Trying to put an end to the netminder’s hot streak will be a Bulldog offense that ranked first in the conference with 3.62 goals per game. Yale was led by captain Brian O’Neill, who finished eighth in the nation and second in the ECAC with 45 points—on 21 goals and 24 assists—this season.
Antoine Lagniere—who recorded a game-three hat trick against Princeton—Kenny Agnostino, and Andrew Miller all also recorded 30-plus points for the Bulldogs, with Miller tying for eighth in the nation with 27 assists.
“We know that Yale loves to play a transition game,” Girard said. “Our coach was telling us today about how many breakaways they can get, so we’ve got to make sure not to create turnovers, make sure especially at the start of games we pound the puck, wear them down physically, just stop them from generating momentum.”
Agnostino had two goals and a pair of assists in Yale’s 7-1 win over Harvard in New Haven on Feb. 18. That victory evened the season series for the Bulldogs, who fell in Cambridge, 4-3, on Jan. 27, thanks to two scores—including the game-winner with 1:19 to go—by senior forward Alex Killorn.
“The difference [in those two games] was the way we came out,” Everson said. “At home, I thought we came out faster and a little more physical. I think that’s going to be the key for us, to kind of get the jump on them instead of reacting to the way they play. If we can make it our style of game, I feel like we have a much better chance of winning.”
Killorn led the Crimson with 18 goals and 36 points in the regular season and finished 10th in the nation with 0.62 scores per game. He was named to the All-Ivy first team last week along with junior defenseman Danny Biega, who paced the squad with 22 assists.
The task of halting the Harvard attack will fall to Yale goaltender Jeff Malcolm, who was seventh in the ECAC with a 2.71 goals against average and .910 save percentage.
Both teams come into the series playing well. Harvard has just one loss in its last 11 ECAC games, while Yale is 4-1-1 in its previous seven contests.
But the Bulldogs have historically struggled mightily at Bright, where the Crimson leads the all-time series, 30-4-3. On the whole, after being ranked No. 1 in the country for much of last year, it has been a disappointing, up-and-down season for Yale.
Harvard, on the other hand, has surpassed all preseason expectations. After being picked to finish dead last in the ECAC media poll, the Crimson ended up third, thanks in large part to a power play that ranked second in the nation.
Harvard has won seven of its last 10 ECAC quarterfinal series but fell at Dartmouth in the quarters last year. This time around, fresh off a rest Everson says was vital for getting the team healthy, the Crimson can advance to the ECAC semis in Atlantic City by toppling the Bulldogs.
“It’s the Yale-Harvard rivalry, which always carries a little more depth to it,” Everson said. “Add in the fact that it’s playoffs, do-or-die, it makes it even more intense and exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although his tenacity on the court says otherwise, there is a soft side to Keith Wright. Just ask the 6’8” senior forward and co-captain of the Harvard men’s basketball team about his mother.
“I’m a mama’s boy, and I’ll admit it,” Wright says. “I’m not ashamed of it.”
If you have attended a Crimson basketball game, chances are high that you’ve seen the object of Wright’s affection, Sabrena Tabron. Tabron, who divorced Wright’s father when Keith was in the second grade, has been in the stands for all but a handful of her son’s games. This year alone she has attended all but the Nov. 19 game at Loyola Marymount and the Jan. 10 game against Monmouth.
Clearly, Tabron is far from the casual fan. She spends most of the games on her feet, reminding the team to keep their hands up on defense and yelling at them to make that extra pass. Occasionally, Tabron will hold up signs to encourage her son and his teammates. She is a cross between super-fan, sideline coach, and mother.
Tabron’s sign from the Feb. 24 game against Princeton, which read, “I’m Keith Wright’s mom,” indicates which  of the three roles she considers most important. This is even clearer when she tells the story of how she and Keith arrived at Harvard.
In some ways, this family journey began years before Keith’s birth, when Tabron could be found on basketball courts in California. Tabron, who played forward like her son, competed at the high school and collegiate level. She played at San Francisco State for a year, where she led the conference in blocked shots as a freshman. She followed that up with two years at California Baptist University. Keith wears number forty-four in her honor.
And Tabron learned much more from her basketball career than a couple on-the-court tips to pass along to her son.
“Basically, basketball always defined who I was, and therefore when it came to college, I didn’t have the stamina to balance education along with sports,” she explains. “So, in raising my children, I had decided that sports would never define them. I always played sports, and it was always basketball, basketball, basketball from the time I was six. So [I decided that] when I had kids, I wouldn’t allow them to play basketball and not focus on their education.”
True to her word, Tabron made sure that education came first in her household.
Keith, his younger sister, and his mother lived in California until 2001, when Tabron decided to relocate her children to the East Coast.
“I chose to leave San Francisco back in 2001 when I wanted to provide my kids with a better life, with a better public school education,” Tabron says. “So I did a little research and found that Princess Anne High School in Virginia Beach was then one of the top 10 schools in the country for their IB program. So I packed up my family and moved cross-country without a job, without a house, and without family.”
Unlike most collegiate basketball players, Wright did not play organized basketball as a child.
But as he transitioned from middle to high school, Wright’s interest in basketball grew. He tried to play during his freshman year of high school—until he called his mother from try-outs to tell her about his interim report card. When Wright informed his mother of the one C on his mid-year grades, she prohibited him from trying out for the team. Tabron says she wanted to teach her son that basketball is a privilege.
Wright obeyed his mother’s wishes and did not play that season.
A year later, Wright told his mother that he wanted to play basketball, in high school and in college. And since his grades met her high standards, Tabron let Keith play.
Both Wright and his mother agree that Keith’s basketball career did not have the most auspicious start.
Keith was competing against students who had been playing their whole lives, and his inexperience showed on the court.
Tabron knew that her son needed plenty of work if he intended to play in college, so she picked up a second job cleaning homes and apartments in order to pay for extra training and conditioning for her son. Sometimes Wright would join his mother and help her clean. Their sacrifices paid off when the family phone rang non-stop during Wright’s senior year.
He received calls from colleges across the country, including every Ivy League school. In the end, the future Ivy League Player of the Year narrowed his choices to Harvard and Princeton. Tabron believes that her son’s recruiting trip to Princeton was the deciding factor.
“I think, honestly, it was [then-] Princeton coach, Sydney Johnson, who helped him decide on Harvard,” Tabron remembers. “[Johnson] said to him, ‘You need to come to Princeton, because Princeton is rich with basketball history.’”
But Wright had other ideas.
“Keith turned and said, ‘I don’t want to be a part of history. I want to make history,’” Tabron notes.
Wright decided that he would write history in a Crimson uniform.  He credits his mother for swaying his decision to go to an Ivy League school.
“She always told me not to let basketball define me as a person,” Wright explains. “[She did not want people to] hear my name and associate that with just a basketball player.... The decision I made was solely my decision, but she definitely influenced that with the way that she raised me.”
In the fall of 2008, Wright said goodbye to his mother and headed to Cambridge.
He had a rough freshman season, contracting mononucleosis and suffering from an Achilles heel injury. Meanwhile, Wright’s sister Morgan was finishing her senior year of high school. When Morgan decided to head northeast to St. John’s University for her education, her mother followed.
Tabron decided to move to the Boston area, where she would be close to her two oldest children. The decision became official when she received a callback two days after sending out blind resumes.
At first, Keith was strongly opposed to his mother’s plan.
“I hated it,” Wright remembers. “I was dating someone from home at the time, and we were best friends in high school. And all my good friends were back home.”
But it did not take long for Wright to change his mind regarding his mom’s decision.
“It was the best thing that could ever have happened,” Wright admits.
With his family closer, Wright’s basketball career seemed to be on the upswing. He took advantage of the accessibility of the weight room and basketball courts, working out at Harvard over the summers.
The Achilles heel injury that plagued him during freshman year healed. What’s more, Tabron says that her son seemed more relaxed after the move. He stopped worrying about off-the-court issues like financial concerns and laundry.
“I think Keith’s biggest challenge was [leaving Virginia],’” Tabron explains. “And I said to him, ‘You need to realize that you are so much bigger than you see right now.’ He didn’t really get it at first, but I think as he goes back to visit friends he sees how he has evolved into a different person and everyone has stayed the same. He doesn’t mind it now because he never does laundry and he never cleans his room.”
“I guess maybe he thought I was going to cramp his style—[even though] he doesn’t even have a style—but it just works for us,” she adds. “I don’t see him every day, but we still talk at least twice a day.”
The rest is history.
Since his family moved to the Boston area, Wright and his teammates have transformed Harvard basketball. The team has increased its season win totals every year since Wright’s freshman campaign in 2008. In a couple of weeks, the team will be playing in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946.
Tabron has had a first-row view of the Crimson’s rise, and she praises Harvard coach Tommy Amaker for taking what was a talented group of basketball players and transforming them into a cohesive team.
Tabron considers the 79-67 home win against Princeton on March 5, 2011 to be her favorite moment of her son’s Crimson career.
“When they won [a share of] the Ivy League championship and everyone was rushing the floor, it was unbelievable,” Tabron recalls. “Keith left the floor and came into the stands and gave me a big hug and said ‘Thank you mom.’ This woman who sent me a picture...said, ‘What a great moment to know that he loves you so much that he thanked you for sacrificing for him.’”
“He defined himself as wanting to make history, not because he wanted to be a part of it,” she adds. “And at that moment, he did.”
Unfortunately for Harvard fans, Tabron’s time in the stands is coming to end.
She will stay in the Boston area with her two youngest children, ages eight and 11, where she will continue her work as the marketing and outreach director at an assisted living facility.
Although she vows to attend future Harvard-Princeton games, Tabron says she must dedicate a lot of her time to Wright’s siblings.
As his career comes to a close, Wright cannot help but think about how much his mother has done for him.
“I reflect on how my mom has helped me every day,” Wright says. “We’ve gone through a lot together, and I think that this portion of it has been awesome. It really caps off the tremendous relationship we have and the tremendous job she has done raising me and the man that I’ve become.”
But it’s not over.
“When they go to the Dance, am I going?” Tabron asks incredulously. “When they went to the NIT, my son called me and said were playing in Oklahoma. I hung up the phone, purchased a ticket, and beat the team there.”
“Sharon Casey, [the mother of junior forward Kyle Casey], and I have a savings account for when they are selected this year so we can purchase our tickets,” she continues. “So yes, I will be there.”
And it seems fitting that Wright and his mother will end this chapter of Harvard basketball history just as they started it: together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team earned its spot in the history books this past week, claiming its first-ever outright Ivy League championship and clinching an NCAA tournament berth. It seems fitting, then, that the Crimson will spend Selection Sunday in the Hall of History.
The Harvard squad will gather this Sunday at 6 p.m. in the Lee Family Hall of Athletic History, located on the Murr Center’s first floor, to watch the NCAA tournament selection show.
Along with the rest of the nation watching on CBS, Harvard will learn its seed and opponent for its NCAA tournament matchup this coming week. The Crimson, which was projected to be an 11 seed in ESPN’s Joe Lunardi’s most recent bracket, will also learn the site of its opening game.
The Crimson’s first matchup will be either March 15 or 16 in Albuquerque, N.M., Columbus, Ohio, Greensboro, N.C., Louisville, Ky., Nashville, Tenn., Omaha, Neb., Pittsburgh, Penn., or Portland, Ore. If Harvard wins its opening matchup, it will play again two days later at the same site.

What do Academy Award Winners Davis Guggenheim and Tom Hanks have in common with Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren? All three have a hand in a soon-to-be released documentary highlighting the challenges of President Barack Obama's first term in office.
The Obama campaign unveiled the trailer of "The Road We've Traveled" on Thursday, and it seems that Warren has landed a big-time supporting role.
Speaking as the former advisor to the Consumer Protection Bureau, Warren characterizes the manufacturing crisis as it stood when Obama was elected in 2008.
"If the auto industry goes down, what happens to America's manufacturing base? What happens to jobs in America? What happens to the whole Midwest?" Warren asks.
On screen, the implication seems to be that Obama saved the day. The lights of an empty factory go dim and by the next frame, Obama, shirtsleeves rolled, is shaking hands with auto workers, back at work.
"The Road We've Traveled" profiles Obama's leadership in the difficult early days of his presidency when the financial crisis was in full swing. In addition to Warren, Vice President Joe Biden, former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, and economic advisor Austan Goolsbee offer their thoughts and insights on the challenges Obama faced during his first term.
The documentary is directed by Guggenheim, best known for "An Inconvenient Truth" and "Waiting for Superman," and narrated by Hanks.
Warren is challenging Republican Senator Scott Brown in what is considered to be one of the highest-profile U.S. Senate races in the country. Warren and Obama’s time on the public stage have been intertwined from the start. In many ways, the story of presidential reaction to the financial crisis is her own.
Warren was named the chair of the Congressional Oversight Committee in charge of monitoring the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) just days after Obama's election. Two years later, in 2010, Obama signed Warren's brainchild, the Consumer Protection Bureau, into law.
The full-length, 17-minute documentary will be released at Obama campaign offices around the country on March 15.

Every Friday, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
March 4, 1897: College Studies
The following figures show the diverging choice of studies at Harvard, Yale and Cornell.
The numbers in the first table denote the total of hours per week devoted to each subject; in the second table the percentage.
March 9, 1963: College May Ban Animal Nudity
The Society for Indecency to Naked Animals (SINA), a national association formed four years ago "to protect our children from the sight of naked horses, cows, dogs, and cats," will attempt to start a campus chapter of the organization at Harvard, Bruce Spencer, vice-president of SINA, told The Crimson yesterday.
SINA, which now claims 50,000 members in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, was founded by the late G. Clifford Prout, who left $400,000 to his son, G. Clifford Prout Jr. for the purpose of clothing all naked animals that appear in public, including any animal "that stands higher than four inches or is longer than six inches." The junior Prout, now president of SINA, has devoted all his energies to carrying out his father's plans, despite attempts by the rest of his family to contest the will.
The Society spends most of its time distributing literature ("Decency Today Means Morality Tomorrow") and serving printed "summonses" to persons found violating SINA's Constitution by appearing in public with naked animals. These documents warn that "the SINA Constitution requires you to answer this summons in person or through a sworn statement before the Executive Board of SINA...within ten days after issuance....setting forth a complete explanation of your actions." Violators ignoring summonses shall "in the name of decency...be deemed unworthy of ever appearing on the SINA membership rolls...."
March 6, 1972: Medical School Team Successfully Implants Nuclear-Powered Heart Device in Living Calf
The National Heart and Lung Institute announced Thursday the first use of nuclear energy to power an artificial heart pump in a living animal.
Dr. Theodore Cooper director of the Institute, reported at a Washington press conference that on Feb. 14, a research team from Harvard Medical School and the Thermo-Elecron Corp. of Waltham implanted a heart assist system with a nuclear engine in a calf.
Cooper announced at the same conference that the first total artificial heart to be completely implanted has undergone short-term animal tests.
Although this complete four-chambered heart pump implant is powered electrically—with external connections or internal rechargeable batteries—it may also be powered by a small nuclear engine.
Dr. Lowell T. Harmison, head of the Institute's artificial heart program, said Thursday that the "complete system is now ready for long-term animal trials."
March 8, 1978: North House Votes Against Name Change
In a House referendum on Sunday and Monday, North House residents defeated a proposal to re-name their House after the late President Conant, members of the North House Committee said yesterday.
The proposal was defeated 67 percent to 33 percent, with 188 people voting, Boudinot Atterbury '79, chairman of the election subcommittee, said yesterday.
Nikki Kowalski '78, chairman of the North House Committee said yesterday many students voted against the change because Conant was not directly affiliated with Radcliffe.
Kowalski added there are no plans to bring up the proposal again.
Opponents of the proposal distributed position papers documenting Conant's lack of commitment to co-education and his role in developing the atomic bomb. Atterbury said this may have adversely influenced students.
