After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the face of it, the list is one of the most banal forms of literature — that is, if it can be categorized as literature in the first place. Listing is often regarded as literature’s great homemaking activity for the purposes of keeping track, counting down, or spelling out. The list is certainly a poor device even for cursory characterization, let alone for tapping the wellspring of a person’s unique subjectivity … or is it? Such is the question Matthew Dicks’s latest novel, “Twenty-one Truths About Love,” will have you asking one page in, then regretting having asked something so blasphemous as soon as you’ve finished it.
“Twenty-one Truths About Love” is a novel comprised entirely of lists, with the occasional letter and memo tossed in with all the throwaway casualness of a Post-it Note. The plot tracks the seven-month-long evolution of its compulsive list-maker protagonist Daniel Mayrock, whose dwindling finances inspire some rather foolish pluck in him when he learns that his wife is pregnant with their first child. Over the course of Dan’s ill-informed but well-intentioned plan to score fast cash, the reader is privy to all the secret longings and tortured, midnight-hour vacillations of a human being nudged gently to a brink and unsure of whether there will be a pool of sharks or a pit of cotton candy at the bottom. The result? A sometimes wild, sometimes serene, and always heartfelt ride that is, first, overflowing with second-hand embarrassment and, foremost, so worth the easy read.
At the story’s outset, Dan is somewhat of an oxymoron: He is a deeply self-loathing, self-perceived failure with (also self-perceived) everything to live for. His beloved wife, Jill, desperately wants to start a family. The catch? Dan’s bookstore is failing and he cannot bring himself to tell Jill about their impending financial doom. What ensues is the fevered attempts of a man with crippling self-doubt — fueled by intense jealousy of his wife’s late first husband, anger at an absentee father, and vexation over an annoyingly overachieving brother — to buck up and save his yet unborn family.
That Dicks’s book so speaks to the flexibility of the novel form — its utter voracity for swallowing up other types of discourse like the list and the letter, as well as its welcoming capacity to engage with multiple modes of language like confession and command — is one of its great feats. The other, more readerly accomplishment of “Twenty-one Truths” is its ability to chart in three dimensions the contours of a realistic protagonist via the seemingly narrow, hopelessly vertical list. One would not think such a structure would allow for a character’s second thoughts to poke through. Dicks achieves just that by stringing together certain lists with invisible connective tissue. A list from page three might pop up again, slightly altered, on page fifty, so that the reader is reminded in real time of the full Daniel Mayrock who comprises all these lists, not just the latest rendition. Even though readers do not get the broad, page-filling narrative voice so at home in the novel, they get a fulfilling form of tale-telling in Dan’s flighty, dedicated lists. His voice is lively, vivid, and certainly not monolithic. In fact, there are times when his obsessive list-making feels like his attempt at sitting down, pen in hand, to construct a little statue of himself that he can count on. The jig is that he is vastly unsure of what he really thinks and wants. Thus, his lists are failed self-definitions. That is where Dicks miraculously locates that sense of a character who does not entirely know himself and who therefore feels viable.
One of the chief functions of Dan’s lists is to confront himself with harsh facts. These submissions are often both revelatory and poignant for the reader. Take his self-reflexive “Why I’m always writing shit down” list, which includes “I want to write a novel someday” and “It’s all grist for the mill.” This is followed by a secondary list, entitled “Real reasons for lists,” in which Dan comes clean: “Compromise at first with therapist because journaling sucks. Finished with therapist but lists became a habit.” After building up this sequence, Dan is able to find his truth, adding that “a habit is just an obsession that pretends to be intentional and controllable.”
Dan’s spirited attempts at self-guidance are heartwarming and often cruelly familiar. Each one is a tiny testament to the human need for organizing contradictory or hazy thoughts into logical progressions. Here is where the heart of “Twenty-one Truths About Love” resides. It does not claim that a list with a beginning and an end is the way to discovering oneself. Rather, the novel relishes in those small wars we fight with ourselves, in our heads, in the hopes that we can narrow down our list of beliefs. If anything, “Twenty-one Truths” says: Away with lists. You couldn’t possibly fit it all in, anyway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Twitter, it takes roughly half a day for a meme format to generate, another one to two days for it to spread, and an additional two days — tops — for it to peter out. When life gets in the way and checking Twitter falls down a few places on a to-do list, it’s easy to return and wonder what 30-50 feral hogs have to do with anything (an actual meme that took over people’s feeds this summer).
Thus, it’s understandable to have missed the mid-November debacle that concerned Sarah Dessen, YA literature, and people’s irrational tendencies to jump into a debate about which they do not possess all the facts. The online tiff began when Dessen, known for literature aimed at teenage girls, posted a screenshot of an article in which a Northern State University student declined to include Dessen’s books on a reading list for college students. Dessen accompanied the image with a caption criticizing the student for not deeming her work worthy of being on the reading list.
At this point, the student is the one who sounds somewhat pretentious: Surely, literature for teen girls has merit. Though people have made a sport out of mocking things that young women like — One Direction, pumpkin spice lattes, discussing their emotions — it’s still a whole genre unto itself, and is worthwhile to those who connect with its themes.
But dig a little deeper, and things get uglier: Multiple famous authors, among them Roxane Gay, Jodi Picoult, Jennifer Weiner, and Jenny Han, jumped in to defend Dessen, and soon things got heated enough that the student had to deactivate her social media presence to protect herself against harassment.
It’s fair to accuse Dessen of being tone-deaf. The student chose to include books about racial justice on the list to broaden the voices heard in literature — hardly unfair, and a detail that Dessen conveniently cropped out on the image she posted to Twitter. She made it seem as though the student didn’t support books written by and about women, when that really wasn’t the point at all. Yes, sexism is still around in 2019, but there’s already enough of it without needing to find new, nonexistent strawmen that only delegitimize the problems that persist.
There are multiple items to note amid this debacle, the first is part of being a responsible Internet citizen is attempting to get all the facts before creating an angry post. Dessen should be aware of this, and obfuscating the entire story when presumably she already knew what was true is attention-seeking at best and dishonest at worst. It’s ironic that she noted that “authors are real people” when she jumped on the serotonin-producing and virtue-signaling band-wagon that is cancelling people online. It goes without saying that the other authors who jumped in should have done their own due diligence too, but thinking before speaking seems to now be associated with the distant past. Roxane Gay did, however, publicly apologize once she realized what happened — something that rarely happens online.
The second problem here is the very act of speaking, regardless of whether one’s speech is positive or negative. Twitter, among other social media platforms, makes it extremely easy to comment, retweet, and like anything in one’s timeline, and this ease has almost destroyed our ability to think about whether our discourse is adding anything productive or meaningful to what already exists. Dessen could have taken this student’s public statement in stride — especially had she looked at the facts more carefully — but she chose to not only talk about it, but outright fabricate what truly happened. Her actions had direct consequences: the proliferation of online harassment.
That’s not to say that we should roll over in the face of unfair criticism, but perhaps silence, in some cases, would be better. Everyone in 2019 is burned out, not just because of the state of politics or the fact that many of us are overworked, but because of the constant noise and the feeling of needing to react and comment that this noise creates. The Internet was supposed to make things more democratic, but now there are too many voices shouting — with the result being that we can no longer discern what is meaningful amid the cacophony.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to not feel just a little bit cheated after reading the first two dozen pages of Elena Ferrante’s new book, “Incidental Inventions.” After reading sensational Italian news articles about how a new novel, slated for release on Nov. 7, was in the works, it was an ever-so-slight let-down to receive “Incidental Inventions,” a compilation of Ferrante’s Guardian column that ran for all of 2018. The Nov. 7 release was not a fabrication, but Italian fluency is, unfortunately, a prerequisite. If you want to read it in English, you’ll have to wait until 2020.
Ferrante is an Italian novelist most famous for The Neapolitan Novels, a quadrilogy chronicling the lives of two women from childhood into adulthood. Ferrante is, however, equally famous for her anonymity and her refusal to reveal her actual name, despite the attempts of the paparazzi and the goading of those who simply don’t believe that a woman could have written such a poignant book series.
One lingering question readers of The Neapolitan Novels might have is how much of the story is autobiographical: After all, the main character’s name is Elena, after all. It’s unlikely the world will ever truly know, but after even quickly skimming one of the essays in “Incidental Inventions,” it’s clear that her fiction is undoubtedly stamped with her own voice.
This essay collection is a success, even though it isn’t fiction. Ferrante requested that her editors to ask her a question every week, to which she would respond and subsequently publish. The formula worked: Each column is its own stand-alone work, and though there is some thematic overlap, it cannot be said that she repeats herself unnecessarily.
Ferrante has an uncanny ability to remain detached from the very words she writes while managing to articulate the precise anguish of the human condition. Just like the listicles on Buzzfeed that round up the good news at the end of the week, Ferrante also finds beauty in the mundane: “I’m interested in the ordinary or, rather, what we have forced inside the uniform of the ordinary.” And, despite women’s thoughts on the pain of childbirth, she writes that “children are our body’s great, marvellous prostheses, and we will not give them literally to anyone, not to mad fathers, not to the country, not even to those machines that promise an inhumanly perfect humanity.”
Ferrante writes about the nature of being a woman, and the dangers of excess within this role: “The ‘too’ of a woman produces violent male reactions and, in addition, the enmity of other women, who every day are obliged to fight among themselves for the crumbs left by men.” Her writing is restrained and methodical, either due to the translation (not the skill of Ann Goldstein, her translator, but rather the nature of English as a more clinical language, especially compared with the emotional intensity imbued in Italian), or to her own style.
Indeed, Ferrante says in one essay that she “would like it if, on the entire planet, there were no longer any reason to shout, especially with pain. [She likes] low tones, polite enthusiasm, courteous complaints.” This discomfiting idea raises questions about whether life is complete enough without the rollercoaster of emotions that, at one point or another, threatens to overwhelm all people. Would humans be human without the peaks of joy and the valleys of melancholy? Perhaps, but to ask that reactions be subdued is to deny, on some level, one’s feeling.
Budding writers can find comfort in her thoughts on the elusive goal of originality. Put simply, new writing doesn’t exist in a vacuum and Ferrante shows that it’s okay to use an old cliché or to borrow from a favorite childhood novel. After all, “No author produces texts without debts. There are no works that make a clean break with the past, works that exclude it — no truly watershed works. Literary novelty … exists in the way each individual inhabits the magma of forms he is immersed in.”
This essay collection is subtle. Ferrante’s writing is akin to a whisper from one friend to another: It utters the truth one would rather not hear, but says it compactly and devastatingly. On jealousy, she quietly notes: “We shut the beloved up in a cage, preferring that he die spiritually and even physically—rather than expose us to the humiliating wound of his escape.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay emailed FAS affiliates Monday stating that she would support faculty who wanted to create an undergraduate concentration in ethnic studies and declared an “institutional commitment” to the discipline.
The email comes as a surge of ethnic studies organizing has reemerged on campus. The swell of activism in the past week — the latest in a nearly five-decade push to establish a formalized ethnic studies program at Harvard — was spurred by the University’s decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña.
Hundreds of students and student groups have signed onto an open letter criticizing the decision, staged a sit-in at University Hall, and interrupted last Tuesday’s monthly faculty meeting. Though several of their criticisms have been directed toward Gay, she did not address the tenure denial in her Monday email.
Gay stood by the position she first stated last fall that FAS must hire more faculty who specialize in ethnic studies before creating a formal department to house them, citing professors’ wide influence over curriculum, advising, and research. She pointed to her efforts to strengthen Native American studies at the University during her tenure as Dean of Social Sciences, as well as her previously stated commitment to hiring four new ethnic studies faculty this year, as evidence of her dedication to ethnic studies.
“At a time when funds for incremental faculty searches are increasingly hard to come by, the decision to advance this search is intended to signal a strong institutional commitment, as well as a sense of urgency to make concrete, palpable progress,” she wrote.
Gay wrote that she would “welcome the idea” of a new undergraduate concentration in “ethnicity, migration, and indigeneity,” adding that faculty, not deans, must “spearhead” the effort by developing a proposal and bringing it before the full faculty for a debate and ultimate vote.
She wrote that faculty would have “the support of the institution” for any attempt to form a new concentration, and that she is prepared to provide the undergraduate curricular committee that would host the concentration with the power to make tenure and tenure-track faculty appointments jointly with any department in FAS.
“With appointment powers, the curricular committee would be able to secure the faculty commitments necessary to sustain the concentration,” Gay wrote.
Gay specifically cited the Department of African and African-American Studies — which, she noted, had its “origins” in the “student activism of the late 1960s” — as a model for how to create a robust ethnic studies program. AAAS, she argued, experienced “years of uneven struggle” before it shored up its faculty ranks and was able to “elevate the study of the African diaspora” to the benefit of Harvard students.
“This history informs my theory of change, and is why my own efforts on behalf of ethnic studies are focused, first, on hiring,” Gay wrote Monday.
Correction: Dec. 11, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Claudine Gay "called for" an institutional commtiment to an Ethnic Studies program at Harvard. In fact, she made the institutional commitment to Ethnic Studies in her email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While disclosures of sexual and gender-based harassment increased by 20 percent in 2019, filings of formal complaints remained stagnant, according to an annual report published Monday by the Title IX Office and Office for Dispute Resolution.
The report, which reviews the University’s sexual and gender-based harassment prevention initiatives, highlighted the new measures undertaken this year, as well as how rates of disclosures and formal complaint filings have changed over the past five years.
Between the fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the rate at which Harvard affiliates disclosed harassment to the Title IX Office increased 56 percent. The jump from 2018 to 2019 was more moderate: While 416 students made disclosures in 2018, 500 did so a year later.
The annual report also found that Title IX training completion rates improved substantially as the training system expanded. The number of people who attended in-person trainings increased 50 percent in 2019, for example, and a newly mandatory staff training yielded a 270 percent improvement in employee online module completion.
The Title IX Office also introduced a new bystander intervention program over the past year.
“Since the initial pilot, the program has been customized and delivered to faculty and staff communities across 20 departments at Harvard,” University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill wrote in a letter included in the report. “The program continues to return promising qualitative and quantitative results.”
In addition to new trainings, the Title IX Office implemented a Student Title IX Liaison Committee in the fall of 2018 and a Staff Liaison Committee in January. Merhill wrote that the student liaisons were “key partners” in implementing several Title IX initiatives this year, including a gender equity summit held in April. The staff liaisons reviewed the online training module for Harvard faculty and staff, work that will be reflected in the 2020 training programs.
The University also launched an anonymous online reporting tool in 2019, but disclosures made through the tool were not included in the report’s count because the tool debuted after the end of the fiscal year.
With respect to investigations, the ODR — which handles formal Title IX complaints — also looked into “related allegations,” for example, alleged harassment based on race, color, or national origin, ODR Director William McCants wrote in a letter included in the report.
McCants also wrote that ODR worked to improve the format and readability of its final reports on investigation over the past year. Final reports for cases originating in 2019 averaged under 22 pages in length, compared to an average of almost 47 pages in 2015.
The plurality of ODR investigations over the last five years involved complaints of “verbal, written, graphic, photo, film, eyeing, sexual advance” or other forms of harassment, with 56 investigations based on this type of reported misconduct. In comparison, 47 investigated cases of unwelcome sexual touching other than penetration, and 39 cases dealt with concerns of retaliation. Thirty-one cases involved non-consensual penetration, and 16 involved penetration and incapacitation.
The Title IX Office and ODR’s annual report comes in the wake of the results of the Association of American Universities’s survey on campus climate regarding sexual misconduct, which were released in October. The AAU survey found that reported rates of sexual violence have remained largely unchanged on Harvard’s campus over the past four years.
“While progress has been made in many areas, all available data supports the need for a multifaceted approach to address issues of sexual and gender-based harassment in academia,” Merhill wrote in Monday’s report. “We are committed to continuing our efforts to this end, by exploring innovative approaches, examining and implementing promising practices, and drawing from expertise both within the Harvard community and across the nation.”
