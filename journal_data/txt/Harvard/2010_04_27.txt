After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James C. Fuller ’10 walks like a ballet dancer, bouncing up on the balls of his feet with each step, even in everyday tennis shoes. In his dancing shoes he is even more airborne, a trait recently celebrated when the Office for the Arts awarded him the Suzanne Farrell Dance Award.
Named for the New York City Ballet’s prima ballerina, the prize is given each year to the student who has achieved excellence in the field of dance. This year that prize goes to Fuller, a senior from California with numerous Harvard dance performances under his belt and a job with a professional company, Ballet Austin, lined up for next year.
Fuller began dancing when he was nine years old after taking part in the San Francisco Ballet Theater’s performance of “The Nutcracker.”
“Companies would come through Orange County and they would need little boys to sort of run around on stage for little character scenes,” Fuller says, “and those were fun so my parents thought, well, let’s try some ballet classes.”
Fuller was heavily encouraged to continue with ballet because of the severe shortage of male dancers in the ballet world. He soon became so serious that he considered skipping college and going straight from his senior year of high school into a professional dance company. “My plan had been to go straight into company” Fuller says. “So college was a big shift.”
His decision to go to college was made when, his senior year of high school, Fuller received a scholarship to travel from Orange County, Calif., to Boston to spend a year training with the Boston Ballet. While living in Boston, he attended Brookline High School and rediscovered his love of education.
“I saw how much fun it could be to be in a classroom where people really wanted to discuss,” Fuller explains. “There was a lot of give and take and exchange of ideas and it was just very exciting for me. I guess at that point I also started to discover modern dance and other ways of approaching dance. I started think that maybe ballet isn’t the only thing of value out there in life and that maybe I should give myself a chance to look around a little bit before I entrenched myself in a career.”
Despite this decision, Fuller still chose to take a year off between high school and Harvard, spending a year dancing as an apprentice for the Portland Ballet. Despite this stint with a professional company, Fuller attributes most of his growth as a dancer to the time he spent performing at Harvard with the Harvard Ballet Company as well as the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company.
“All of my experience as a performer I got here,” Fuller says. “I think that I’ve grown tremendously, just having the opportunity to perform every semester.”
This experience will help him next year in his role as a full company member of Ballet Austin, located in Austin, Texas. There, not only will his days consist of rigorous ballet classes, but he will also be performing in the company’s season of classical and contemporary works. Fuller is quick to describe this future employment as normal, despite the fact that it’s far from the average post-college job.
“It’s more or less a nine-to-five thing,” he insists. “It’s very much a standard job, except that it involves a lot of slightly different activities.”
Outside of his upcoming job, Fuller hopes to continue to collaborate with new choreographers, just as he was able to at Harvard.
“One part of the Ballet Austin is that there’s a fairly long layoff,” Fuller explains. “I’d be interested in working with choreographers who are still finding their voice. I feel like in some ways that’s the most fruitful artistic relationship. It’s very open, very malleable.”

Though some may call Jordan A. Reddout ’10 a “late-bloomer” in musical theatrics, her enthusiasm and talent both on and off the stage have earned her the Radcliffe Doris Cohen Levi Prize, given each year to an outstanding Harvard undergraduate in the realm of musical theater.
“Unlike a lot of others, I didn’t do theater as a kid,” says Reddout. “My freshman fall, I played viola in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and rode crew. Then one day my freshman roommate, and co-recipient of the award, Christine [K.L. Bendorf ’10] heard me singing and told me to audition for something.”
So her freshman spring, Reddout tried out for her first show and became a performer. In the words of her theatric “partner in crime” Bendorf, “She took off on her own! We’ve been doing musicals together since freshman fall when we both discovered that we could sing, ‘What is This Feeling?’ from Wicked. Thus began the regular jam sessions in our room.”
Since then, Reddout has thrown herself into all things music on campus. In addition to being a Choral Fellow with the Harvard University Choir and singing at every morning prayer in Memorial Church, she has been a member of a cappella group the Harvard Opportunes. She has also performed with the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, as well as the Brattle Street Chamber Players.
Her musical theater roles demonstrate her range and love of the stage. She has appeared in productions of Maury Yeston’s “Nine,” Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Utopia,” Stephen Sondheim’s “Putting It Together,” and Steven Schwartz’s “Children of Eden.”
Reddout demonstrates equal ability behind the scenes as well. She served as Music Director to the productions of “Jekyll & Hyde” and “Little Shop of Horrors.” She was also the Assistant Producer of “Urinetown (The Musical).” She is currently working on Sondheim’s “Into the Woods,” which she is directing.
“‘Into the Woods’ has been incredible,” says Reddout. “I was deciding what to do with my senior spring and again, Christine was there, and she said, ‘You should direct!’”
Bendorf is proud of her suggestion. “[Reddout] has been an absolutely fabulous director,” she says. “She really gets down to the heart of every character and makes that come across the stage.”
Aside from Bendorf’s encouragement, Reddout finds it difficult to point out a single person who influenced her most. “Theater is very collaborative to begin with.” She says. “The students I’ve worked with have been really influential and creative: you’d be surprised how much they can get done. My peers surprise me over and over again.”
With a life so invested in music, Reddout’s academic interests are not surprising. A joint concentrator in Music and Anthropology, Reddout has managed to blend the two together into a unique cross-cultural investigation.
“It’s a really interesting mix for me,” says Reddout. “I really like history and exploring different cultures, and anthropology is a really hands-on discipline. I actually just spent the last summer living in the mountains of Spain with gypsy goat herders, studying their music for my thesis.”
Next year, Reddout will be attending film school at the University of Southern California, but after that, nothing is set in stone.
“The problem is I keep falling in love with new things every two years.” says Reddout. “So hopefully something sticks. I don’t know what’s next, but I’m excited.”

“I started playing piano and composing at the same time. My first music teacher taught me both, which is pretty unique,” says Christopher T. Lim ’10, who has been playing and composing classical music since childhood. “That’s how I began my training, so I’ve never really tried to pursue any other genre of music.  There’s a lot of possibility for expressivity, detail, creativity, and complexity.”
Even though Lim studied at the Julliard Precollege Division in high school, Lim says his relationship with music progressed most during his time here at Harvard. He has been involved in various classical music organizations, such as the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, the Lowell Chamber Players, and the Bach Society Orchestra. Lim was also co-president of the student group Music in Hospitals and Nursing Homes Using Entertainment as Therapy, a community service organization that brings Harvard classical musicians to Boston area hospitals and retirement communities.
“I’ve become more involved in performing music than I had been before and more committed to it. I’m very fortunate that Harvard has provided that opportunity,” Lim says.  “The classical music community is certainly small and everyone knows one another. There are a lot of organizations, but it’s very easy to get involved and meet other people who are really passionate about it.”
Apart from his extracurricular involvement with classical music on campus, Lim is also a joint math-music concentrator. He says he wrote his thesis solely for the music department and credits his classes with having contributed to his musical development.
“I am someone who believes that the academic study of music can be related to performance and composition. Especially my coursework in music theory has definitely influenced and changed the way that I think about music. I’ve taken many of the music performance and composition options that are offered by the music department, so I’ve definitely been able to integrate performance and composition into my actual coursework” he says.
In addition to pursuing activities for his own creative growth, Lim has worked with various Harvard students in different artistic disciplines, such as composing a piece for choreographer Julia T.  Havard ’11 that will be performed in the Cambridge Queens Head Pub on Saturday. While working with artists in various disciplines is challenging, Lim views it as an opportunity to look at his craft from a different point of view.
“She was trying to describe the music to me, but I realized the easiest way to figure out what she wanted was to listen to music together and pick out examples of music that sounded like what she wanted,” he says. “It’s not easy to collaborate with people in different disciplines, but it’s certainly very rewarding and valuable. It’s interesting to see how other people experience your artistic medium when they’re not specialists in it themselves.”
Next year Lim will be completing a master’s program in piano at the New England Conservatory. While he ultimately plans to pursue a degree in medicine, he sees music as playing an integral part in his life.
“When I first came to Harvard I thought I would major in neurobiology, but, then I ended up majoring in music and math. I’ve realized that music will always be a part of me,” he says. “It’s not a coincidence.”

“I’m still getting over bronchitis and my show opens tomorrow!” A statement like this doesn’t sound so incredulous coming from Christine K. L. Bendorf ’10, a Quincy House senior whose passion for theater would never allow her to be stopped by something so trivial.
Bendorf is a theatrical powerhouse by any standards. Not many undergraduates, even the most artistically driven, can say they’ve performed in nine theatrical productions, assisted with another 18, and even directed one—all while being a member of the Radcliffe Pitches, VoxJaxx, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players (HRG&SP), and other performance-minded campus groups. This spring, alongside Jordan A. Reddout ’10, Bendorf has been awarded the Radcliffe Doris Cohen Levi Prize, which recognizes students with outstanding talent and enthusiasm for musical theater.
Dana Knox, the Production Coordinator of the New College Theatre, believes her near-omnipresence in Harvard’s theatrical world is no accident. “Christine has shown such amazing dedication to the arts scene at Harvard that it is no wonder that she rose to prominence very early,” he says.
All four of Bendorf’s years at Harvard have been centered on honing her craft. “Freshman fall I discovered that I didn’t want to be a math major,” says Bendorf, who proceeded to create a special concentration: Dramatic Literature and Practice. She describes the concentration as over 50 percent English Literature, with supplementary courses in acting, stage design, dramaturgy, and other performance-based classes. She even enrolled in a one-on-one tutorial about Stephen Sondheim with her advisor, Professor Robert Scanlan. “What other Dramatic Arts courses are there?” says Bendorf. “I’ve taken them all!”
Amidst involvement in such an extensive number of productions and performance groups, Bendorf has been able to find two main points of artistic focus: Stephen Sondheim and Gilbert & Sullivan. She had a lead role in a HRG&SP production her freshman fall, and subsequently joined the company’s board.
“My main passion in life is for Stephen Sondheim,” says the actress who, since enrolling at Harvard, has performed in four Sondheim productions. “I’m making the focus of my final concentration project Stephen Sondheim and the process of putting up one of this shows.” This project is certainly applicable to her extracurricular work; she is currently performing the role of the Baker’s Wife in the production of Sondheim’s “Into The Woods” on the Loeb Mainstage.
Sondheim was instrumental in what Bendorf considers her most positive artistic experience on campus—performing the role of Johanna in “Sweeney Todd” during her sophomore spring. “It really felt like my first show that could be professional,” she says, recalling how the production sold out the Loeb Mainstage—something the American Repertory Theater’s professional productions rarely accomplish. “We joked that we could’ve taken it to Broadway,” she says.
For Bendorf, who is in the process of transitioning to the stage name Christine Lacey, this joke may become a reality. She will spend her summer performing nine shows in ten weeks with the College Light Opera Company on the Cape Cod, and then plans to give acting in New York a try. She debated over the idea of going to graduate school, but decided soon after auditioning that she was using it as a safety net. “I need to try it out, be scared. It’s scary but I know I’m going to be doing what I love to do and what I’ve wanted to do my whole life.”
Despite her apprehensions about the future, Bendorf is as determined as ever to succeed: “I plan to move to New York, tutor, and wait tables to move my way up to Broadway!”

“He’s one of those amazing brains who can process advanced quantum mechanics and rip an awesome jazz solo. He uses both sides of the brain to the fullest,” says E. Forrest O’Connor ’10 regarding his roommate Malcolm G. Campbell ’10.
Campbell is one of the few Harvard students jointly enrolled at the New England Conservatory of Music (NEC), a highly competitive and world-renowned music institution. Ever since his freshman year, the pianist has spent time shuttling between the two campuses, taking music lessons, practicing with NEC students, and performing in jazz ensembles. After he graduates from Harvard this spring with an A.B. in Chemistry and Physics, he will continue his education full-time at the NEC and receive a masters degree in Music.
For most people, enrollment in these two schools would force them to choose between succeeding academically or musically. Campbell, however, manages to do both. “It’s interesting because the conservatory is an incredibly demanding environment, as is Harvard. To function in either one of these orbits is challenging enough. To function in both and not only thrive in both – that’s incredible,” says Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts at Harvard.
Speaking to his academic prowess, Campbell was inducted into the Harvard chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society during his junior year. Entry into Harvard’s chapter requires an outstanding grade point average as well as two heavily weighted faculty recommendations.
Music, however, is Cambell’s true passion, and his success in this arena is a reflection of his love for the sounds of music and the musical interactions that he has with others. “It’s what I’ve always loved. I derive so much inspiration from people I’m playing with and the connection you make when you’re playing with people,” he says. “Whether I’m playing funk or jazz or classical, one of the things I think I do naturally is connecting with other people when I play.”
“He’s a pretty remarkable musician,” says Ken Schaphorst, chair of the NEC Jazz Studies Department. “He can read and play at a very high level. He’s also very creative and plays with a lot of energy and passion.”
Despite the constant praise that he receives for his musical abilities, Campbell is the first to criticize himself and push to become a better player. “Music for me is so personal and I care so much about it. It can be really tough. If I don’t do well with music, it really affects me personally and really can get me down,” he says. “There are so many things that I’m not satisfied with. I don’t want to sound complacent with my playing—there are so many avenues in which to improve.”
Although Campbell’s academic and musical successes leave him with many options for the future, many think he has the ability to make it as a professional musician. “I think he has all the tools. I see him succeeding. If anyone has a good shot, it’s Malcolm. It’s a combination of talent and motivation, which I think he has,” says Schaphorst.
When asked about his post-grad aspirations, Campbell says, “I’d really love to see where music takes me. I’m sort of really realizing now how seriously tough it is, so we’ll see. Hopefully I’ll get better next year, and maybe it’ll work out so I can have a career in music.”

When one considers that during his time at Harvard College, Michael W. Zellmann-Rohrer ’10 has served as lighting designer for over 40 college theater productions, a fellow technician’s description of Zellmann-Rohrer as “a bright spot among others” becomes fitting in more ways than one. And in recognition for both the figurative and literal illumination which Zellmann-Rohrer has provided to the theater community, the Office for the Arts at Harvard (OFA) has selected him as this year’s recipient of the Louise Donovan Award for work behind the scenes in the arts and the Alan Symonds Award for outstanding technical achievement in theater.
Zellmann-Rohrer came to Harvard with very little experience in lighting design. “I had done some design in high school on a very small scale,” he explains, “but I never had any formal lessons. During my freshman spring I just started assisting on all kinds of shows and learned that way.” But according to Beth G. Shields ’10, former president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (and Zellmann-Rohrer’s girlfriend), Zellmann-Rohrer’s knack for lighting design has never been hindered by a lack of formal training. “Michael possesses a phenomenal talent as a designer,” she says. “He’s incredibly creative, and he can solve the most difficult challenges that come up in any show.”
According to J. Michael Griggs, Technical Director of the Loeb Drama Center, the most impressive aspects of Zellmann-Rohrer’s lighting career are the sheer quantity of productions on which he has served and the calm with which he manages his responsibilities. During the last four years, Zellmann-Rohrer often has worked on multiple shows at the same time, and yet, Griggs explains, “He never complains. He’ll often be the only one in the theater, fixing everything quietly until it’s finished, and then it just seems to happen like magic.” When asked how he juggles such an intense workload, Zellmann-Rohrer simply replies, “I always tried to think of it as a hobby or a fun extracurricular. I got through those stressful times by remembering that it was supposed to be fun, and also with the help of the great people in the Harvard theater community.”
Zellmann-Rohrer has become an integral part of Harvard theater during the last four years. “Everyone in the theater here knows Michael,” Griggs says. “He can be kind of shy, but somehow he appears here and there around campus and shows just seem to get lit.” In addition to his omnipresence, Shields adds, Zellmann-Rohrer has made a significant impact by mentoring other student technicians. “Michael has a real dedication to helping others,” she says. “He’s great at stepping back and helping other designers figure out what they want to happen, and then letting that happen.”
Zellmann-Rohrer, a Classics concentrator in Mather House, says he plans to pursue a PhD in Classics after graduation and does not foresee a future in lighting design. “I don’t think I’m committed to do it professionally,” he says, “but I still intend to see as much theater as possible. I’ll definitely miss it.” And the Harvard theater community is sure to reciprocate the feeling, says Shields. “Whenever Michael isn’t doing the lighting for a show, the theater feels empty without him,” she says. “Most people who have seen a Harvard theater production have been inspired by him, whether they realize it or not. He will be sorely missed.”

Inspiring, magnetic, and daring are words that frequently appear in descriptions of theatrical superstar J. Jack Cutmore-Scott ’10. During his time at Harvard, he has been involved in every aspect of the theater process—he has performed in 14 productions, directed or assisted in six others, and written four original plays. This spring, he is a recipient of the Louis Sudler Prize in the Arts for his outstanding talent and achievement in the performance and composition of drama.
Cutmore-Scott grew up in London and came to Harvard after taking a gap year to train at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He is an English concentrator, but has also studied Russian, Italian, French, and Portuguese.
At the same time, an important part of his education has come from exploring and pushing his own artistic horizons on the stage. “A big part of my ambition while I’ve been here is to try and make sure that every project that I took on has been challenging me in a different way than anything has challenged me before,” Cutmore-Scott explains. “I’ve loved trying stuff that I am not really sure I can do. Like playing in Hasty Pudding was very much out of my comfort zone—I was a wolf and then a female swan—and that was a great experience.” Indeed, he has had the courage to play roles ranging from that female swan to Hamlet, and from a manipulative thug to a homesexual man during the Holocaust. He has also acted in student films and improv comedy.
Fellow actors remark on his generosity on the stage and sense of humor. Rachel E. Flynn ’09 says, “You know that he’s going to be fun and always supportive—that you’re going to have a great time and that he’s got your back.”
Cutmore-Scott made his professional debut this April as the lead in “Entertaining Mr. Sloane,” a Publick Theater Boston production. His performance earned him a nomination for the Elliot Award, which recognizes excellence in Greater Boston Theater.
In his four years here, Cutmore-Scott has also been focused on writing and producing original work—three of his own plays as well as the original work of others. In his very first year at Harvard, Cutmore-Scott wrote, directed, and produced “Fall,” a comedy about the ups and downs of being a freshman. “There is always a spin and twist to his writing,” Zachary B. Sniderman ’09 notes. “Even with something like ‘Fall,’ which seems straightforward, he was looking for ways to break the boundaries.”
Alex R. Breaux ’09, who has acted and collaborated with Cutmore-Scott several times, characterizes him as a theatrical renaissance man. “He is really a theater artist… He has the drive, but also the charm to pull off mounting a production from its hatching of an idea all the way through casting, through rehearsals, and then really put on a good product,” Breaux explains. “He has that well-roundedness that you really need to make an impact in theater.” Breaux believes that Cutmore-Scott has made an important contribution to Harvard theater by setting the precedent of bringing fresh work to the stage. In doing this, he has both made room for original work to be produced in the Loeb Experimental Theater and helped create an atmosphere where people are receptive to it.
Reflecting on his theater experience at Harvard, Cutmore-Scott says, “I came in knowing that I enjoy theater and it’s a good hobby. I’ve realized that it’s become more than a hobby and I can’t really imagine myself doing anything else professionally.” Next year he plans to keep auditioning while writing and producing plays. “I’ll see where it all takes me,” he says.
Eric C. Engel, his director at the Publick Boston Theater, believes that Cutmore-Scott’s abilities will take him far. “I have found Jack to be an extremely gifted and gracious actor, and I look forward to seeing his career flourish. I have no doubt that it will,” he says.

When Carolyn W. Holding ’10 walked into her first audition for a Harvard theater production, director Catherine “Calla” Videt ’08-’09 knew that she had found her lead. “I felt that little reaction when talent walks in,”  she says, “and when I learned that Carolyn was a freshman, I was so happy that she would be here for many years.”
Videt had a good eye. Holding, now a senior, has distinguished herself tremendously over her past four years as an undergraduate. Since her first lead role as Lucie Cabrol in Videt’s “The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol” on the Loeb Mainstage, she has appeared on the Mainstage twice more as Electra in “The Flies” and Woman 1 in “Metamorphoses.” In addition, she played Beatrice in “A View from the Bridge,” Viola in “Twelfth Night,” and Gloria in “You Can Never Tell.” For this impressive body of work, Holding received the 2010 Jonathan Levy Award in Drama, which recognizes the most promising undergraduate actor at the College. Holding will be sharing the prize with Talisa B. Friedman ’10.
“Carolyn is luminous and transformative,” Videt said. However, for an actor so naturally gifted, Holding entered her freshman year as a hesitant artist. “I resisted theater to some extent at first,” Holding says, reflecting on her entry into the Harvard theater scene.
Holding had decided to take a gap year before coming to Harvard and discover if she was ready for the life of a starving artist. Cutting herself off from her parents financially, she moved to New York City. “I hoped to bridge the divide between high school ‘theater kid’ and professional actor, but the insight was disheartening,” Holding says with a chuckle. “Finding roles in plays, on TV, in commercials, and waitressing in between—it was a struggle.”
Despite her apprehension after this experience, for her first production at Harvard she managed to find a vibrant community. “One project just popped up one after the other,” Holding says. “I realized that the artists at Harvard are incredibly engaged, constantly working, and always motivated,” she continued. As she performed on Harvard’s many stages, her hesitancy for theater disappeared. “It seems like I’ve slowly come around full circle,” she says.
Holding notes that she also took time to explore many other facets of the Harvard community, concentrating in History and Literature with a secondary concentration in Dramatic Arts. “I sometimes feel that I only have one foot in the theater door,” she says. But this fall, she will be focusing on her art form when she begins her studies in the Graduate Acting Program of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. At Tisch, Holding said that she “hopes to gain the tools to make anything—a TV commercial, a soap opera, a dull play—really insightful.”
Holding also noted that the Harvard theater community extends to New York City. “It gives you a sense of how great the artists are here, and makes the step to New York more of an adventure than falling into a black hole,” she remarks with a laugh.
Videt, who works in New York City, said she anticipates seeing more of Holding in the upcoming years. “She is a joy to work with and a force on the stage,” Videt said. And it is because of these qualities that Holding’s adventure proves to be so promising.

Patrick H. Quinn ’10 talks about dance using colloquial descriptions not typically associated with the art. “Dance looks so fucking beautiful when you see it,” he says. “Especially to people who have never danced before and are maybe watching for the first time. It looks like the most gorgeous, graceful thing, with legs floating up to ears. It looks phenomenal.”
This inclusive view of dance characterizes Quinn’s attitude about the art to which he devotes much of his time as a choreographer and performer. Unlike most dancers, Quinn did not practice the form until he arrived at Harvard. An actor during high school, he went to the final hours of Common Casting his freshman year. There, he happened upon “American Grace,” the Harvard Ballet Company’s 2006 dance showcase that was auditioning through Casting. It was during this production that Quinn discovered the beauty of the art that would come to define his four years at Harvard.
“Backstage, I watched all the dancing and I was like, ‘This is so cool!’ I didn’t know people danced like that. I came back the next semester and enrolled in every dance class Harvard offered regardless of prerequisites, and that was it,” Quinn says.
Quinn admits to feeling out of place initially in some of these courses. “I had to walk into classes with people who had been dancing for 14 years and stand in the back and basically feel like an asshole because they all knew what they were doing and I didn’t,” he says. “It sucked. But it’s just that I have no shame, so I did it anyway. Now I can stand in the middle of the class and be somewhat mediocre.”
While he is quick to be self-deprecating, Quinn has more than made up for his lack of initial experience. He has choreographed 11 dances in his years at Harvard, served as the co-director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company (HRMDC) this past year, and taught dance at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School—all this among other activities, such as directing “Cabaret” his freshman year and helping to tech various productions. Although the Computer Science concentrator plans to work at Microsoft after graduation, Quinn will attend classes at the Pacific Northwest Ballet School, eventually using his savings to start his own dance company.
Quinn’s success largely stems from his bold, fearless attitude—when told that freshmen generally do not direct shows, he says his reply was, “Oh, that sucks. I’m going to prove you wrong”—but also from natural talent. “Though Patrick doesn’t have the extensive dance training that I and many of his other dancers have,” says Marin J. D. Orlosky ’07, a dance associate at the Office for the Arts at Harvard, “he has a unique gift for embodying dance styles—and sometimes even specific choreography—after only watching a dance a few times.”
Nowhere is this gift more evident than in his most recent piece in the HRMDC’s spring show, “In Transit,” which is titled “March 20, 1995.” Inspired by the sarin gas attacks in the Tokyo subway system on that date, the dance is the culmination of Quinn’s choreography work so far. “One night I sat bolt upright in my bed and watched the dance in incredible detail in my head and I was like, ‘This is what I want onstage,’” he says. “And now, onstage, it looks exactly how it looks in my head. That’s all I want to do. I did it once with this piece, and I can do it again, and that’s what I want to do for the rest of my life.”

Like many senior thesis writers at Harvard, Alexander J. Berman ’10 works at a desk cluttered with the accumulation of months of work. But his thesis, titled “The Anomaly,” isn’t—as the title might suggest—a study into a statistical or sociological incongruence. It’s a short film about, in Berman’s words, “an engineer who blows up stars and falls in love with his robot coworker.”
Berman isn’t just writing his thesis—he’s also storyboarding, directing, and editing it. He attributes his do-it-all mentality to the philosophy of Harvard’s Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) Program: “You have to go out and be involved in every aspect of the filmmaking process,” he says. With a Fulbright Scholarship secured for the filming of a feature-length documentary in Siberia next year, Berman has ensured that he will have the opportunity to bring that hands-on approach to a future project even more ambitious than his science fiction supernova romance.
He plans to base this documentary on a project he completed during his sophomore and junior years. That earlier project, “Songs from the Tundra,” is a musical about reindeer herders. One sequence in the film follows a small child from eating raw mountain goat brains with his father after a hunt to playing Grand Theft Auto III on his computer at home. “The punch line,” Berman says, “is that you shouldn’t take people at face value.”
“Songs from the Tundra” features lush high-definition images of tundra lifestyle overlaid with the folk songs of a 90-year-old blind native. Berman’s carefully crafted documentary won him recognition in the United States and abroad, netting him the Grand Jury Prize at the Provincetown Film Festival and a selection from the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam—the biggest documentary film festival in the world—where he was the youngest of the 15 student filmmakers selected.
Berman says those awards gave him newfound confidence but also made him realize the difference between making a film for himself and making one for hundreds of film festival viewers. “Some people want to talk about theory,” he says, “but working in this medium is about the audience and making them feel something.”
Berman brought this viewer-centric ideal to his thesis film, looking for something that would have immediate impact. “To really connect with people now you have to show them something they’ve never seen before,” he says. He found just that with supernova simulations from the University of Chicago’s center for Advanced Simulation and Computing. Using these simulations and other cutting-edge graphics available in the public domain—3-D models of space stations from NASA, for instance—he and his brother Benjamin S. Berman ’12, an animator and fellow VES concentrator, were able to construct convincing shots of a spaceship hurtling through outer space.
Berman faced the daunting task of making low-budget sci-fi believable by applying his hands-on, practical methodology to his special effects work. His process involved figuring out how to use available technology to achieve his desired, futuristic effects.
Nevertheless, his auteur filmmaking style does not hamper his resourcefulness and improvisation. “Songs from the Tundra” was originally meant to be an environmental film about the clash between Siberia’s near-frontier status and the industrialization its gas deposits are attracting. Finding himself treated as a tourist at every turn, however, Berman was forced to adapt. The result was his reindeer herder musical.
Likewise, Berman threw half of the material he filmed for “The Anomaly” away, added new animation sequences, and wrote a new voiceover in post-production. “As many little pictures that you draw or scripts that you write, you really don’t know what you’re going to have until you finish it,” Berman says. “And that’s what’s so exhilarating about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, Lillian M. Fang ’10 approached her thesis advisor Ruth S. Lingford with an ambitious proposal. “If it had been any other student, I would have advised her that combining Maya 3D digital animation with hand drawing and puppetry was way too ambitious. But Lily has a steely determination and a work ethic that is exceptional even for Harvard, and I am delighted to see that I was right to trust her,” says Lingford. Fang’s thesis “Shapeshifter,” now in the final stages of production, is a mixed-media film about a village of plaster-and-wire puppets who encounter a two-dimensional genie.
“I wanted to explore all these myths of shape-shifters across history,” explains Fang. “It was also a chance to combine a lot of the types of art that have meant a lot to me. ‘Shapeshifter’ is my favorite because I connect to it.”
This labor of love has also helped earn Fang recognition for her animation in the form of the prestigious Council Prize in Visual Arts. “Shapeshifter” will also be featured in the VES Program’s “Frame by Frame: Animation at Harvard” exhibition over Arts First weekend.
Fang looks forward to the showing. “Last year, they screened our work outside on the side of Widener. I thought that was really cool, the mix of the texture of the wall with the projected scenes. I would like to see ‘Shapeshifter’ displayed that way.”
A resident of Quincy House concentrating in Visual and Environmental Studies (VES), Fang set her sights on a career in the arts ever since taking classes at the Seattle Academy of Fine Art in high school. At Harvard, Fang has made creative strides in animation.
“Harvard’s not really known for its art department, but it’s great,” says Fang. “It’s small, but talented and supportive. I looked at Princeton’s, but it was much smaller and basically relegated to an attic space.”
Fang is also a gifted painter and illustrator; her work has appeared in Tuesday Magazine and The Harvard Advocate. And when President Drew Faust opened up Massachusetts Hall to an exhibition of student art in 2008, Fang’s painting “Self-Portrait” was welcomed into the showcase. Fang even explores the arts in her free time by playing clarinet in the Harvard Wind Ensemble. “I figured out I wanted to concentrate in VES pretty soon,” says Fang. “I basically extend it into every part of my life.”
Though many people have encouraged her along the way, Fang names Lingford, her adviser and mentor, as a particularly important influence on her work. Lingford was happy to help with the process. “I was lucky enough to be Lily Fang’s thesis adviser, and I watched ‘Shapeshifter’ develop over the year,” she says.
Though she has no specific career in mind, Fang has a promising future. She has been offered a place in the Masters program in animation at the Royal College of Art in London, England.  “She has proved herself to be a gifted artist and animator in so many ways, and I can’t wait to see how her career develops,” Lingford says.
Yet even with all her ambition and accomplishments, Fang manages to stay grounded about her work in animation. “It’s the only thing I’m good at,” Fang claims. But as Lingford puts it, “I’ve never seen a combination of so much talent with so little ego!”

“I feel like I’ve done a kind of one-eighty since I’ve come here,” says Rebecca S. Lieberman ’10, describing the evolution of her art throughout her time at Harvard. Lieberman’s final exhibition as an undergraduate will feature selections from her thesis in Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) including “Whitetail Deer, A to Z,” a two-hour video piece.
According to Lieberman, she had no intention of concentrating in VES when she arrived at Harvard. Despite an interest in photography, she was initially daunted by the rigor and interdisciplinary demands of the department. After taking a class in VES and joining the art and design boards of The Harvard Advocate as a freshman, Lieberman says her concentration “decided itself.” “She’s involved with a lot of different kinds of art, and I think in the future she’ll continue to be prolific in a lot of different mediums,” says friend Martabel A. Wasserman ’10.
Once out of the dark room, Lieberman gravitated toward sculpture and video. Her first video, “PATTY,” takes its subject matter from the security-camera footage of Patty Hearst, the heiress kidnapped and brainwashed by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), robbing a bank along with her captors. The piece incorporates aspects of the SLA’s manifesto, fairy tales, 1970s horror and science-fiction film, TV news interviews and would-be Warhol assassin Valerie Solanas’ radical feminist “SCUM (Society for Cutting Up Men) Manifesto.”
Lieberman owes much of her exposure to the influences that would inform her sculpture and video work to Amie Siegel, an artist and professor in VES. Her time as studio assistant to Alison Knowles—a Radcliffe artist-in-residence famous for her involvement in the Fluxus art movement of the 1960s alongside Marcel Duchamp and John Cage—helping to prepare lectures, participating in Fluxus performances and contributing to works exhibited in Potsdam’s Fluxus Museum, also impacted Lieberman’s work.
Lieberman attributes the most influence, however, to Helen Mirra, the artist and VES professor who taught Lieberman’s first sculpture class and advised her thesis this year. Mirra pushed the conceptual boundaries of Lieberman’s art, particularly regarding formal and material decisions in her sculpture work. “She and I are really different, but I think in the way she approaches talking about art, her work and other people’s work, we speak the same language,” Lieberman says. “I like the ways she critiques; she has the most vast body of knowledge of art and art theory and criticism that I’ve ever experienced. Everything leads me to something new.”
Her thesis exhibition consists of “Whitetail,” installed alongside several sculptures made of wood and synthetic wood substitutes. The video is a restaging of a 1984 instructional taxidermy video, where she replaces the titular animal with a driftwood log. “I was interested in taxidermy as a practice of display and representation, and the way in which the natural becomes a replica or representation of itself,” Lieberman says.
Lieberman hopes to remain critically engaged with art-making after Harvard. She plans to find a job in the field of visual arts, and later to pursue a Master of Fine Arts.

“My inspiration has always come from my teachers. Throughout high school my English teacher, seeing something special in my writing, encouraged me to continue writing, and so I did,” says Justin T. Keenan ’10. Keenan, a member of the Harvard Book Review, The Harvard Advocate, and Harvard’s poetry magazine, the Gamut, has seen several of his stories published on campus, and recently submitted a collection of stories as his creative thesis in the English department.
Keenan was honored with Harvard’s Edward Eager Fund Prize last year for his short story, “Snow.” The piece is included in Keenan’s collection, “Alive Enough,” whose stories are set in and around his home state, Kentucky. Titled ironically to reflect Keenan’s emotional and physical state at the time of his thesis deadline, “Alive Enough” addresses themes of melancholic family dysfunction and emotional confusion, presented in subtle, but evocative language. Despite the setting and the occasional piece—such as “The Dog Story”—that borders on memoir, Keenan says his work does not stem primarily from personal experience. “Your writing is always informed by experience. We all have a vocabulary of narratives, impressions, and images that is largely defined by our personal experiences. I draw a lot from my background, but I don’t consider most of what I write to be autobiographical,” he says.
Keenan, who transferred to Harvard after freshman year from Transylvania University, has spent his three years at the college steadily developing his writing. He maintains, however, that his environment is not necessarily the most conducive for writing. “I think it is important to remain conscious that you are in a very small world when you are in the Harvard literary scene,” he says.
“I don’t mean to say something so banal as ‘be yourself’ or ‘write what you want’,” Keenan continues, “but to write the things that you need to write about or that will move you regardless of whether some people say they are interested in them or not.” Keenan attempts to maintain the style and content of his work despite expectations he has encountered. “I think there is a real disparity between what I think about when I write and what you are taught to look for in your English classes, or what the Advocate looks for in the Fiction board.”
The young writer, who cites authors such as Annie Proux and David Foster Wallace as major influences, is unsure what his post-graduation plans will entail. “I don’t know what I am doing next year, but I’m going to continue writing,” he says, voicing his intentions to continue seeking publication for his stories in magazines and journals. “It is a shame that so many people here feel that they need to begin a career or begin down a certain path as soon as we graduate,” Keenan says. “But in reality, we are all going to be fine. Everyone needs to chill the fuck out.”

“The set is important in how you initially visually perceive a production,” says Beth G. Shields ’10, “because it is the fixed thing in the show. As the action, the story, and the time change, the set can really guide the audience through the atmosphere the way that the dialogue guides you through the literal events of the story.”
As Shields recognizes, the work of those behind the scenes lays the foundation for the success of theatrical productions. Although the set does not play as animated a role as the actors, it can transform the atmosphere of a performance. The set is instrumental in conveying a production’s essential message in a way that a single actor cannot.
Shields first discovered her interest in set design in high school. When she arrived at Harvard, she bonded with the theater community when she responded to a couple of requests for technical assistance. After getting to know the people she was working with and becoming more involved in building sets for Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) productions, Shields says she found her niche at Harvard.
“I definitely consider theater to be one of the biggest things I’ve done here,” she says. Shields’s repertoire includes last year’s “The Birthday Party” and this semester’s “The Pillowman,” both of which ran in the Loeb Experimental Theater. In addition, she designed the sets for the Loeb Mainstage productions, “Into the Woods” and “Angels in America.”
First serving as the Experimental Theater Coordinator, Shields rose through the ranks to become president of the HRDC this past year. However, her accomplishments have not been without some constructive learning experiences.
“It’s a hard thing to work with because a lot of times people know what they want the set to look like and do,” Shields says. “There’s a constant revision process and you have to find a balance between the set being interesting… and facilitating the action of the play. It can be a challenging process particularly as you work with new directors whose ideas change quite a bit… and as you try to nail down what you’re doing more and more.”
Harvard’s theatrical productions are unique, in that they rarely seek to make a profit. Instead, they challenge their audiences to think critically about the design, organization, and larger themes of these plays.
“I think people are more willing to take risks here. So whereas at other schools, seasons will consist of a big musical and a Shakespeare [play], we got to do ‘Blasted’ by Sarah Kane, which the American Repertory Theater has been wanting to produce for years, but hasn’t been able to because financially it doesn’t seem feasible. People are willing to do that here and get on board for that production. If there are 20 people in the house that night, that’s still 20 people who saw that incredibly amazing piece of theater,” she says.
The scholarly and close-knit environment that Harvard fosters have made Shields’ experiences especially rewarding.
“I think the theater community here, because it so small and does so much, is probably the most welcoming place you could possibly find at Harvard. It’s just a great group of people and everyone helps each other out to get these billions of shows done with a very small group of technicians,” she says. “It’s been a very positive experience for me, both from the community that I’ve become a part of as well as an artistic outlet.”

“I’m pretty boring,” says Talisa B. Friedman ’10, who in reality, is anything but. Alongside Carolyn W. Holding ’10, she was recently awarded the Jonathan Levy Award in Drama by the Office for the Arts at Harvard (OFA), a prize recognizing the most promising undergraduate actor or actress in the College. Her performance credits include eleven Harvard productions and several productions staged abroad and overseas.
In addition to playing several lead roles, notably Sandy in “Grease,” Clytemnestra in the Visting Director’s project “The Flies” and Ophelia in “Hamlet,” Friedman has performed in two Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) Visiting Directors’ Projects and one professional A.R.T. work. She is grateful to have taken advantage of professional theater.
“You really are working at a standard that I don’t think you necessarily get otherwise,” she says.
Friedman got her start in South Africa, where she lived from the ages of eight to twelve. She started singing in a touring children’s choir, then auditioned for a show choir, which she credits with pushing her in a more theatrical direction. In high school she dabbled in professional shows, small films, Shakespeare studies, and directing but found a particular passion for acting. “I realized I liked acting better than singing because it required a lot more intelligence and thought.”
“Choosing a school without a theater major was a wild move at the time,” says Friedman. She knew she wanted to work in the business, but decided against conservatory training. “Everyone in the industry that I knew told me to go to a liberal arts school,” says the English concentrator with a secondary in Dramatic Arts. “I thought maybe they were telling me that because they didn’t think I was going to make it.” However, Friedman seems to have underestimated her own talent.
“I know perhaps better than anyone how much she is capable of and how successful she will undoubtedly be,” says close friend and blockmate J. Jack Cutmore-Scott ’10, also an actor and OFA award recipient. “She brings a level of professionalism to both rehearsals and performances that is uncommon in student theatre.“
“I didn’t realize quite how much I had to offer until I got here,” she says. “I thought I’d get bored with the acting scene quickly—I really haven’t.” Senior spring marks the first semester Friedman has taken off from performing in an HRDC show. She has hardly taken a break, however—her credits this semester include performances in Edges, a collection of student-written songs; three plays for the Harvard Playwrights’ Festival; the Annual 24 Hour Plays Festival; and two student films.
“I’m going to move to New York in September and just start waiting in line for eight hours a day,” says the aspiring professional, who has already begun auditioning in New York City between on-campus performances. Luckily, she has a network of friends from Harvard with prior artistic endeavors who have already forged similar paths. “I’m hoping they’ll show me the ropes,” she says.
Friedman is, in a way, relieved to have delayed her jump into a competitive artistic environment. After an open call for the Spring Awakening National Tour, she says, “It was such a relief to come back here and have conversations with real people who could talk about more than just what their belt range was. I’m so grateful I got to spend time learning and being with interesting people.”

The studio of Vi T. Vu ’10 is stacked with paintings. Vividly fluorescent animal and vegetal figures leap across dark backgrounds, multiplying in mirror images of each other. Look more closely, and strange themes begin to emerge: anthropomorphic shapes, images of violence and renewal, all come together in a series of intricately-articulated symbolic forms. All orders and variety are thrown together, but the composition is far from careless. Vu, has created her own, hard-to-catagorize, world.
What’s strange is that although the images are so surreal, they seem familiar, as though Vu has found a way to tap into the primordial subconscious of a fairytale. There is something sublime about the pain on the canvas, and the exquisite care with which each detail is executed.
In an effort to comprehend Vu’s brightly-colored paintings of animal and human figures, the observer—trained in our hyperactive descriptive culture of tweets, texts, and Facebook updates—might be tempted to latch onto a single word—hallucinogenic, or even psychedelic. Yet, trying to capture Vu in one word does a disservice to her artistic complexity. As Vu’s thesis advisor, Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) department professor Andrew Beattie, says of the “miracle worlds” she paints: “They’re not cute and she’s not cute—that’s the wrong word. When you use the words ‘whimsical’ and ‘quirky,’ it can lead to some kind of generic impression that’s not accurate.” Vu’s work has a substance and passion that goes far deeper than any immediate superficial reaction.
The art reflects the artist. In the estimation of those who know her, Vu is a deeply sincere, rooted, and kind individual. This unique individuality stands out in Harvard’s competitive culture of networking and self-promotion. Vu is neither averse to nor solely motivated by exhibiting her work. Beattie commends this quality, noting that it speaks to Vu’s intense, personal engagement with her art. “[Vi is] not terribly moved by exhibition. She’s looking for a certain kind of standard… a more personal pursuit of something truly good.” Vu, Beattie says, is not looking for approbation from a larger community, but rather a sense of personal self-satisfaction, a more introspective and, perhaps, more genuine motivation.
Vu’s progression towards becoming an artist was in some ways unexpected. Though she says she has always had a passion for art, in her first year and a half at Harvard she focused on Molecular and Chemical Biology, taking only one VES class each semester. Her interest in medicine came from spending time with her father when he was hospitalized with cancer. She was accepted to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute internship program, which she participated in for three years before focusing wholly on her art in her senior year. Though she now has a secondary in Neurobiology, her engagement with her art has increased in intensity over the past two years, culminating in her work for her senior thesis.
As is evident from the introspective nature of her paintings, Vu’s relationship with art is an intense expression of deeply felt, personal emotion. As she says, “A painting is everything in your world, deposited in that work: everything you think, believe, and know. Or don’t know.” Yet Vu’s work is not inaccessible. Instead, it almost teases the viewer, speaking on many different levels. Vu describes her own work best: “I suppose I don’t make conversation, but whisper secrets to myself.”

What happens after “happily ever after”? This is the question that drives “Into the Woods,” directed by Jordan A. Reddout ’10 and playing on the Loeb Mainstage through May 1. In Stephen Sondheim’s retelling of several classic fairy tales, Jack (of ‘Beanstalk’ fame), Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Cinderella all find themselves wandering in the same dark woods. Tying these various stories together is that of the Baker and his Wife, who search for the four items that will lift a curse that has been cast on them: “The cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, the slipper as pure as gold.” Sondheim’s play is in itself alive with magic and mystery, but what is most enchanting about this production is the incredible energy that its cast brings to the stage.
In the opening number, “Prologue: Into the Woods,” the fairy tales inhabit separate areas downstage, in front of a flat, black backdrop. It is only once they venture into the woods that the characters’ paths begin to cross and the familiar stories become complicated. The stage, too, becomes more elaborate, as the backdrop is lifted to reveal the set, stunningly designed by Beth G. Shields ’10. The trees are stylized to appear textured, ancient, and gnarled, appropriately evoking the atmosphere of a supernatural forest. Reddout, in her direction, makes excellent use of this space. One tree doubles as Rapunzel’s tower; another becomes a vehicle for a benevolent apparition who resides at the grave of Cinderella’s mother.
With its spirits and character transformations, giants and magic beans, it would be an understatement to call “Into the Woods” a technically complicated play. Despite being interrupted with a few sound-system hiccups, this production’s technical realization of the show is subtle, but deliberate and creative. From the booming voice of the giantess to the smoke that appears alongside the spells of the Witch, the production effectively establishes the magical world of the woods without distracting from the vocal work and acting of the remarkable cast.
“Into the Woods” is necessarily an ensemble effort and, impressively, there is not a single weak link in this production. Samuel R. Schoenberg ’13 and Christine K. L. Bendorf ’10 are paired well as the Baker and his Wife, and the subtle evolution of their relationship over the course of the play forms a solid center for the many intertwining stories. A Sondheim veteran, Bendorf (who also acted as Johanna in 2008’s Mainstage production of Sondheim’s “Sweeney Todd”) creates a character that is equal parts practical and provocative. While maintaining her character’s witty charm, she effectively poses the moral questions of the play, at one point singing, “If the end is right, it justifies the beans!”
The Witch, whose curse the Baker and his Wife are trying to undo, undergoes a more dramatic physical and emotional transformation. Her role is also perhaps the most vocally taxing, a responsibility which Megan L. Amram ’10 pulls off with ease. Amram is by turns menacing, sympathetic, and hysterical as she belts, croons, and chants her way through the woods.
Some of the show’s most humorous moments reside with the antics of Gus T. Hickey ’11 and Elliott J. Rosenbaum ’12, who play the two charming but philandering princes. As a duo, they are masters of comic timing and innuendo. Hickey also takes on the role of the Wolf, who pursues Little Red Riding Hood with a relish that echoes the hunt the princes engage in as they chase after Cinderella and Rapunzel.
The princesses, similarly, are not the naïve damsels in distress familiar from Disney home movies. Cinderella, played by Samara R. Oster ’13, ultimately convinces the Baker to look beyond the woods and his insecurities, in a scene that speaks to her strength of character. And although this Cinderella can communicate with birds—and sings just as sweetly—her talent at one point draws a disbelieving quip from the precocious, ferocious, and hilarious Little Red Riding Hood (Maya S. Sugarman ’12).
Jack—played by Patrick J. Wicker ’13—is an appropriate foil for Little Red Riding Hood. Where she is adamantly inquisitive and at times even bloodthirsty, Jack is innocent to the point of utter foolishness. It is Jack’s encounter with the beanstalk that precipitates the tumultuous events of the second act. After “Ever After,” the number that closes the first act, the plot takes a turn for the darker.
“No one can prepare you for the world,” the Witch laments as the kingdom falls apart and the characters become more and more lost in their wanderings through the woods. But while the lives of the characters deteriorate, the cast’s performance only becomes stronger. They adeptly relate how their characters come to terms with a world where innocence, once lost, cannot be retrieved; where powers that are given up cannot be restored; and where there is no “happily ever after”—but, at least, there is some semblance of reality.

On Thursday, Catherine B. Lord ’71—a visual artist, writer, curator, and intellectual focusing on queer theory, feminist history, and colonialism—will receive the Spring 2010 Harvard Arts Medal. Within a matter of days she will publish an article arguing that Valerie Solanas, better known as the woman who tried to assassinate Andy Warhol in 1968, should be taken more seriously as a voice in the feminist movement.
The controversial piece is characteristic of Lord’s style. Her oeuvre is polemical, iconoclastic, and highly visceral. The exhibitions she has curated, with titles like “Pervert,” “Trash,” and “Gender, fucked” appropriate and subvert the language used to marginalize lesbians and other groups. “The Summer of Her Baldness: A Cancer Improvisation” is challenging in both form and content. A collection of images, e-mails, and journal entries, it is a breed of memoir about Lord’s experiences with breast cancer, but also a treatise on gender, language, and the culture of serious illness.
Although controversy stands out in a cursory examination of Lord’s work, a closer look reveals an inventive and nuanced thinker. Despite Lord’s concern with radicalism—in her own words, an interest in “different kinds of margins”—her work still boasts broad relevance and appeal.
Born in Dominica to multicultural parents, Lord boasts an international background and a slew of accomplishments within the U.S. Since receiving her Master of Fine Arts, Lord has traveled between the country’s universities and foundations for the past 40 years, accumulating fellowships and professorships almost continuously—including one from the Andy Warhol Foundation. Her visual art has been shown at various venues, including the New York Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center; her writings have been published in numerous artistic journals. Currently she holds a position as a professor of Studio Art and Women’s Studies at the University of California, Irvine.
The selection panel favored Lord for the interdisciplinary nature of her career—which, in their view, is emblematic of the modern artist. “I love the way she approaches art,” says Helen Molesworth, the chief curator of the Institute of Contemporary Art and a member of the selection panel for the Arts Medal this spring. “She does so from the position of someone who makes art herself, from the position of someone deeply immersed in the history of ideas or the history of theory, and she is also an extraordinary writer. She has a beautiful facility with language, and she has a way of writing that comes from a deeply personal place that never feels diaristic or narcissistic.” Molesworth gained personal experience working with Lord when the two taught an undergraduate seminar.
It is perhaps unsurprising that someone who studies sexuality is a master at deriving conceptual arguments from highly personal topics, and nowhere is this clearer than in “The Summer of Her Baldness.”
“I think there’s this thread of idiosyncracy and personal inflection in what I write. What’s important to me is to confuse that. Some people define things as either personal or political, and I’d rather taint either side of that with the other. People have politics. Politics inform people, and then they live their lives differently. People often react to ‘Her Baldness’ as a highly personal thing,” Lord says, stressing that such a view misrepresents the book’s aims. “But,” she adds, “something happens when you write down that stuff. It becomes something that’s outside of you. You put things into a form, and the form begins to have its own integrity.”
Indeed, Lord is an intellectual at heart and if anything, she seems slightly uncomfortable that her work has been controversial. Her most recent project is a survey text called “Art and Queer Culture: 1885-2005,” on which she collaborated with her colleague Richard Meyer, Associate Professor of Art History and Fine Arts at the University of Southern California. “Art and Queer Culture” was born from a failed attempt by the pair to curate a show on that topic. The idea originated from their work together on another exhibition about art and feminism.
“We looked at each other and said, ‘Why don’t we do a queer show?’” Lord said. “We made a proposal and sent it off to the obvious museums—museums I won’t name here, but that have demonstrated their dedication to contemporary art. Museums where we have connections. There was a resounding silence, if that’s possible.” Lord demurred about whether the subject matter was the cause of the show’s failure.
Meyer is more explicit about the controversial aspects of Lord’s work. “Even today,” he says, “most American art museums would shy away from a show focused on queer culture. Museum trustees and directors, especially behind closed doors, remain fairly conservative and risk-averse.”
Meyer and Lord have disagreed before. “We had a pretty extreme difference of opinion about Valerie Solanas,” he says. “I felt that Catherine was idealizing a woman whose writing was incredible but whose actions were indefensible,” he says, adding that “Catherine saw Solanas’ ‘SCUM [Society for Cutting Up Men] Manifesto’ as an indelible representation of feminist rage and lesbian revenge, and I saw it as, well, scary.”
Lord was quick to qualify the criticisms from Meyer and others levelled at her work on Solanas. “I don’t think it’s right to shoot people, unless you really, really have to,” she says. “But nonetheless I think it’s important to come up with a reading of [Solanas’ manifesto]. There are a lot of guys who shot people or strangled their wives or knifed them to death, and they continue to be taken seriously. I’m really not condoning that.”
At her acceptance ceremony, Lord will discuss her less controversial current work, a “text/image project” inspired by a group of commonplace books from the Caribbean. The book does not push a particular argument, but rather reflects Lord’s personal interests. “It’s a matter of combining things that I’m actually interested in. I’m really interested in plants, you know? I’m really interested in food, and its relation to taste literally. I’m interested in bad paintings. I love photographing paper. I like being outside. All of this stuff is actually my life.”
Lord does not see this move as a step down from her previous work. “To sound utterly cliché about it, you have to trust what you’re interested in,” she says.
Lord will receive the Spring 2010 Harvard Arts Medal at the New College Theatre on Thursday, April 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Cracks,” a dark little tale directed by Jordan Scott (daughter of director Ridley Scott) and set in a girls’ boarding school in the English countryside, all is outwardly beautiful. And how! Lips in the film, which are usually pouting and receiving of loving close-ups, are deepest crimson; as sensuously undulate as the verdant hills in the background. The water in which the girls take their diving lessons is always sparkling, set in such a contrast to the gray stone of the school that it makes the harmony of colors sing. Everything is shot with a saturation of hue that deeply excites the eye.
But the aesthetic splendor proves, perhaps a little predictably, to be little more than a patina. The lips of schoolmistress Miss G (played with tense precision by Eva Green) are put to unspeakable use by their owners, and the shimmering water becomes the site of unhealthy competition amongst her students, as well as an ill-advised night of au naturel swimming. Not all is as lovely as it once seemed.
The performance of Green as the worshiped teacher and mentor carries this tension and gives weight to the disparity between the beautiful and the miserably ugly. Miss G acts the part of the charismatic leader, the model of enlightened womanhood to her girls, but the façade is never fully convincing. There is something lurking behind the smile. The keen observer knows from the beginning, owing to the tortured duality of Green’s acting, that Miss G is no Jean Brodie—she lacks that famous character’s intelligence, refinement, and life-experience. The shallow allure that Green conveys is not to be mistaken as depthless acting—it is the indeed the very crux of her character and the lynchpin of the film entire.
This surface beauty, communicated so effectively by Scott and her able team of actresses, and so essential to the film’s message, can nonetheless sometimes work against the film’s value as a piece of engaging cinema. One can easily tire of the brooding, plaintive gazes, and the zoomed-in, sped-up shot of a blooming flower in one scene is simply indulgent. Sometimes “Cracks” can feel like a watercolor painting; still and soft and lacking dashes of exuberant feeling.
Such lazy inertia, exemplified by a drawn-out pan of the pupils lying on the grass in sundresses on a summer day, is struck away with a vengeance, though, as “Cracks” turns nightmarish in its final act. Ultimately, the story is a sordid one. As the film ends, the plot veers onto such a wild, jolting track that the cheeks redden and the hand flies to cover the gaping mouth. But somehow, though “Cracks” turns out to be a nasty little shocker, it does not feel like trash. In the tradition of other British psychological dramas like 1992’s “Damage” and 2006’s “Notes on a Scandal,” the film is presented so artfully that we are not ashamed to take a perverse pleasure in its debased thrills. The filmmakers manage to give a gorgeous sparkle to their sleaze and delight the American viewer with their Britannic bag of tricks: lush landscapes, finely tuned turns of phrase, and pretty accents with elongated vowels.

Original Student Composers
May 1, 2010
6:00 p.m.
In a variation on a surrealist parlor game, a small group of Harvard students pass around a blank sheet of manuscript paper folded like a fan, each one writing a line of music without being able to read any more than the musical notes directly preceding it. After each composer has contributed to the work, someone will sit down at a piano and play whatever surprising creation the group has devised.
Creative exercises like these are but one of the many ways in which the members of the Harvard University Composer Association help foster the work of student composers. The group meets weekly to discuss each others’ work, listen to recordings, and perform public edits, thus giving members valuable artistic feedback. During Arts First Weekend, these students will have their pieces performed in front of a live stage at a concert on Saturday at Holden Chapel.
“I’m learning so much from everyone in the group.” Zachary T. Sheets ’13 says. “It’s very rewarding.”
Among these composers whose work will be featured is co-president Oliver D. Strand ’11. Strand’s piece, entitled “Lineament 1,” is a composition for flute that was created at the request of one of his friends, a student at the New England Conservatory.
“The word ‘lineament’ refers to the distinctive lines which comprise something’s characteristics, such as a person’s unique facial features. Right now, I’m learning about musically distinctive lines,” Strand says. “In this piece, I’m looking at how melodically distinctive I can make a composition using particular musical lines.”
Maxwell A. Hume ’10 will also have one of his works performed. Entitled “Old Photographs, New Memories,” the solo piano piece was originally created for a music course.
“I was going for a jarring juxtaposition of nostalgia and trauma within the idea of false memory.” Hume says. “I was interested in the phenomena of people having false or created memories, and these possibilities were part of the emotional framework of the piece.”
Although these composers are musicians themselves, many prefer not to perform their own compositions.
“I learn more when I hear my pieces from the audience,” Strand says. “I gather so much from their reactions—a gasp, a leaning forward—all of which are very helpful to me as a composer.”
In particular, Strand says he pays close attention to the ways that the endings of his pieces are received by the audience.
“You can tell a lot about an ending by seeing how long it takes people to start clapping,” he says. “If it happens too slowly, it means that they weren’t ready for it. If it happens too quickly, it means that it was too obvious.”
In this way, Strand is able to engage with the audience in something of a musical conversation, as repeated performances of his compositions give new meaning and direction to his work. For composers like Strand, Saturday’s concert provides yet another opportunity for creative growth.

Enigma is the intrigue of “The Untitled Project,” a self-conscious play that breaks the barrier between audience and actor, and focuses on the very process of making theater. The hour-long show will run in multiple locations—ranging from the Signet Society to the Holyoke Center Gallery—from Friday to Sunday, and aims to separate itself from the typical trajectory of many of today’s plays by remaining somewhat mysterious.
“I’m generally obsessed with uncertainty,” says Director Calla C. Videt ’09. “I work in a sort of haze of uncertainty.” Within the context of “The Untitled Project,” such uncertainty is almost logistical—the form of the event depends on the impact of revelation and surprise. The audience, she believes, should arrive knowing very little about the project, but instead should be drawn by curiosity; and the show, she says, is only effective when you don’t know what to expect.
“In a theatrical experience where you know what you’re getting,” says producer Kevin J. Davies ’10, “the plot is not as important as the spectacle.” “The Untitled Project,” on the other hand, is driven almost entirely by the text—because its aim is not to merely tell a story but also to create a relationship.
The relationship between actor and audience is achieved by certain interactive moments, moments that vary from show to show, and which are not under the actors’ control. Theater, says Davies, is often all about control. But so much of this play depends on what is happening in the room before the show starts, or the way the audience responds, that control seems to dissipate. Davies intends to make people unsure of whether theater can do more than just put a story on stage, whether it can blend the border between reality and fiction.
The story, however, is indeed important. “My aim has a lot to do with process, collaboration, storytelling,” says Videt. We live in worlds with so many excess stimuli, she says, but she adds that at the same time, “We are these storytelling machines; what draws us to tell each other narratives?”
“In a world of iPads, iPhones, and Facebook,” Davies says, “face to face interaction and live performance are falling to the wayside.” Everything’s available on YouTube, but in “The Untitled Project,” the aim is to counteract this prevailing cultural current with an intimate moment that the performers and audience share.
The border between audience and performers is central to the production’s goals, and emphasized throughout. When the show begins, it is unclear who is acting and who is observing. “For a moment everything is on the same plane,” Davies says. And this blending of roles, leading the audience to question the nature of theater, and what it can become, is vital to the goals of “The Untitled Project.” “The only way to continue to be relevant is to use the medium in new ways,” Davies says. “In 100 years theater will be completely different.”

“ODDSAC,” the new visual album by psychedelic pop band Animal Collective, is enough to make you feel as if your head has been transported from your body, as if you’re standing on the other side of the world, staring back at yourself in the distance. “ODDSAC” is 53 minutes of brilliant, yet quirky mayhem.
Since the release of their debut album “Spirit They’re Gone, Spirit They’ve Vanished” in 2000, Animal Collective have invariably sought to challenge prevailing musical perceptions. With their eccentric fusion of psychedelia, pop, and indie rock, the band has achieved musical mastery on records such as the highly acclaimed “Strawberry Jam” and “Merriweather Post Pavilion.” Now, with the creation of “ODDSAC”, the band is attempting to diffuse their musical psychedelic experimentation into a visual aesthetic. But is this just another hoax from the quartet who like to refer to themselves by names like “Panda Bear” and “the Geologist,” and who wear animal masks to press conferences, or is there some greater artistic value at work here? The answer is perhaps both. It is a fundamentally subjective experience; with no coherent dialogue or plot, the film relies upon the individual’s ability to translate the visuals and sound into an aesthetically pleasing and worthwhile production. The viewer is as integral as the work itself to the success of Animal Collective’s visual album.
The “visual album” is a relatively untapped medium, with low-profile releases by the Chemical Brothers and British band One eskimO providing two of the very few other examples. The album is a series of graphics and music which only together form one coherent body. The idea is not to have a recorded album put to images, nor a movie put to music—it is for the two mediums to feed together, or as Collective member Deakin put it, the two agents must “have a circular influence on each other.”
Though not scheduled to be released until June, the film was screened last Tuesday at the Brattle Street Theatre. Following a brief introduction by director Danny Perez, Deakin, and the Geologist, the audience was plunged into a sea of psyche-disrupting images and sounds.
“ODDSAC” opens upon a distraught girl alone in a wallpapered room. As heightening drum beats pound away, the girl begins to frantically tear wallpaper off the walls unleashing a profusion of slick mud, in a scene that invokes Perkins Gillman’s story “The Yellow Wallpaper.” The mud torrent is seemingly unstoppable, despite the girl’s frantic struggles, and as the mud continues pouring, the profusion of bizarre sounds increase in volume and fury. The successful unity of the visuals and sound trigger intense emotional responses, arousing feelings even of distress as the scene totally envelops the viewer. But when one is on the verge of becoming totally overwhelmed by the uncontrollable derangement, in floats the soft vocals of Panda Bear, lending reassurance and calm.
These scenes of successful sonic-imagistic synthesis mirror the bizarre brilliance of songs such as “Summertime Clothes:” they are interesting, frightening and revelatory. However the film can, at times, become lost in its overly obscurantist mode. At one point, a single shot of a random red and black plane upon a white background lingers for at least five minutes. Multiple times, loud and abrasive sounds punctuate tranquil, motif-less scenes, with the sole aim to shock. It is in scenes such as these that the film becomes overly self-indulgent, relinquishing the aesthetic brilliance which is achieved through the subtlety of many other scenes.
“ODDSAC” seems to reject any objective analysis. Its reception is dependent upon whether one can accept the aesthetic eccentricity and allow oneself to be captivated by it. The film will attract endless speculation about its meaning, and its signification. But this misses the point. As Perez stated, “Don’t try to find a meaning.” The aim of the film is to achieve aesthetic unity, which it does.
The work displays a transcendence of the image-sound boundary, a transcendence which generates psychological disruption and shock in the viewer. But further than this analysis, we should not attempt to ponder. Any meaning the film has is what it arouses in the individual; there is no universal symbolism to the images or music. Attempting to unravel such a non-existent meaning would be futile, and would only serve to destroy the personal connection for which the film strives.

“What if we’re two loons, nutty as fruitcakes, and there’s no one else around as a sanity barometer?” asks matriarch Phyllis Hogan (Aneliese K. Palmer ’12) midway through Nicky Silver’s “Fat Men in Skirts!!!?!,” a play directed by Caroline R. Giuliani ’11 which runs through May 2 at the New College Theatre.
Silver’s script constantly questions the ways in which perspective can challenge and twist views of acceptable behavior. Throughout “Skirts!!!?!,” unsettling and bizarre topics including cannibalism, mother-and-son incest, and serial murder are presented in the same plane of sanity as familial destruction, drug use, and adultery. In this generally well-directed and effective production, viewers are purposefully left to sift through the jumble of disjointed, jarring scenes and decide what is dream, what is reality, and whether there is a true difference between sanity and insanity.
“Fat Men in Skirts!!!?!” chronicles the darkly humorous and tragic disintegration of the Hogan family. The family’s destruction is catalyzed by the play-opening plane crash in which Phyllis Hogan and her 11-year-old son Bishop (Christopher J. Carothers ’11) are stranded on a deserted island. As his family struggles to survive, patriarch Howard Hogan (Noah A. Hoch ’11) becomes more involved with his porn-star mistress Pam (Ella G. Gibson ’13) back at home. Once the family reunites, the four characters clash with disastrous results.
Despite the play’s non-linear plot progression peppered with flashbacks, internal monologues, and scene changes between the island and the outside world, the actors’ superb abilities to transition between scenes keep the show cohesive and imbued with forward-momentum.
Palmer has the most difficult task in this respect, because her character switches quickly between modes. In one moment she is a naïve newlywed; in another, a crazy woman trying to understand that her husband no longer loves her; and in another, a frustrated mother. She injects humor into all of these roles, especially with lines such as her distracted dismissal of her son: “Can’t you go play with the dead bodies or something? You’re eleven; you should like that sort of thing.” Palmer rises to the occasion in every scene, softening her character’s sharp and inaccessible edges and bringing empathy and nuance to a difficult part.
Both Palmer and Hoch shine in one of the most disturbing scenes in the play, when the 16-year-old Bishop rapes his mother on the island. Giuliani’s decision to have the actors perform the scene symbolically, with the stage bathed in sinister red light is a testament to her excellent direction. Hoch angrily stands at Palmer’s feet—yelling “Shut up!” over and over—while Palmer writhes on the ground, screaming and moaning in a scene as visceral and chilling as a literal representation.
While the rape scene continues, Gibson walks onstage and announces, “Ding! There will now be a short intermission.” Her nonchalant delivery of this tension-displacing line exemplifies her disturbingly humorous performance throughout the play. Her eventual transition between a desperate mistress and a paranoid schizophrenic effectively blurs the play’s reality.
The show’s elaborate set-design and lighting also have a hand in confusing viewer perception. In the first half of the play, the stage is divided into two raised platforms: one containing a deserted island scene and the other, a fully furnished living room. When the lighting switches between platforms, it seems that there is a scene or temporal switch.
When, however, characters interact across the platforms or wander between them—as they frequently do—any understanding of the island and the outside world as separate and unconnected realities is shattered. The set’s spatio-temporal malleability works in tandem with other design details: the offstage director’s chair labeled “Hogan” that Bishop frequently occupies, and the disembodied voices that suggest the play might be a product of Bishop’s insane mind.
“Fat Men in Skirts!!!?!” excells at engaging its themes, but it does have some notable flaws. Occasionally, Giuliani’s direction crosses the line between dark humor and graphic tastelessness, as in the scene when Bishop eats a dead baby and continually spits chunks of it across the stage. In moments like these, the play is completely inaccessible and repulsive, rather than thought-provoking or funny.
Additionally, Giuliani’s attempt to break the fourth wall fails. Moments where the actors directly interact with the audience are out of place and serve no practical purpose in a play that is already jarring and difficult to comprehend. The debris strewn across the back rows of the theater feels unnecessary, while the moment when Palmer tosses a beach ball into the crowd is awkward and confusing.
“Fat Men in Skirts!!!?!” is a mind-bending, extremely dark, and very funny play that questions the conventional understanding of sanity. While not perfect, Giuliani’s direction creates a baffling, yet ultimately rewarding theatrical experience.

April 30 to May 2, 2010
4:00 p.m., 11 a.m., 12 p.m.
Every year for the past 14 years, the Sunken Garden Children’s Theater revives a portion of every undergraduate’s childhood by putting on a performance of “The Ugly Duckling,” a fairy tale written by Hans Christian Andersen. The performances run all through the weekend of Arts First.
“The Ugly Duckling” separates itself from many of the other dramatic performances during Arts First weekend for several reasons. For starters, it will last roughly 20 minutes and will be performed outside. In addition, the show’s attendees can expect that the performance will not take itself too seriously. Gus T. Hickey ’11, the show’s director, says, “It’s kind of silly and very fun.” Indeed, though many of show’s 17 actors are seasoned performers on the Loeb Mainstage, Hickey says that the audience can expect, “lots of silly, loud voices and silly jokes. There will be lots of fun and energy,” making it clear that the show will carry a light, enjoyable, and easy-going air despite its veteran cast. And, though the show is scripted, Hickey says “There was very minimal rehearsal for the show,” which should, as it has in the past, create some fun, impromptu humor that highlights each actor’s personality.
Unlike many of the other shows put on during Arts First week, this performance will not be catered directly to Harvard undergraduates. Rather, the performance is designed to bring the performing arts to younger audiences and the Cambridge community as a whole. Anthony J. Sterle ’11, the show’s producer, says, “This is one of the few shows on campus which targets members of the Cambridge community.”
Hickey adds, “The show is for the little kids. It’s a really silly fairy tale, and it’s nothing serious. The show is about exposing kids to theater and having community involvement in the Arts First weekend.” Although the show is primarily targeted at much younger audiences, the performances nevertheless draw a wide range of age groups. Sterle explains, “There’s definitely humor in the show that undergraduates and adults will understand and find amusing,” he says.

At 8:30 on a Tuesday night, all is quiet in Memorial Hall. The tourists who spend their days shuffling around outside the exit to Annenberg Hall have shuttered their cameras, rubbed the John Harvard statue once more for good luck, and gone back to their hotels. Inside Sanders Theatre, however, all is surreal chaos. A wiry, white-haired man sings a complex passage of music without any consonant sounds while encouraging the chorus that encircles him to enunciate more. When he finishes the passage, the entire chorus starts whistling, and he grins sheepishly before counting them off.
As they sing, he rises on his toes, bends his knees, and rocks back and forth, his mouth moving in time to the music and his feet quivering across the platform. One might easily think the entire sound of the 65-man Glee Club is emanating from Jameson N. Marvin, the Holden Choirs’ Director of Choral Activities and a Senior Lecturer on Music.
This June, after 32 years of conducting at Harvard, he’s stepping down.
A PERFECT SOUND
Marvin, affectionately known as “Jim” by his students, is the latest of five conductors for the Holden Choirs—composed of the Glee Club, Collegium Musicum, and the Radcliffe Choral Society—since the Glee Club was founded in 1858. Marvin holds one of the most prominent choral conducting jobs in the country: the Glee Club and the Radcliffe Choral Society are, respectively, the oldest men’s and the oldest women’s collegiate chorus in the country.
“Jim has elevated all three groups to a level of national recognition that I don’t think any of them really had,” says Adam M. Gann ’12, the Glee Club Historian. “Jim’s legacy, the thing that Jim is particularly good at, is making the three different sounds—Men’s, Women’s and Mixed—sound particularly good, whereas most conductors will only have experience with one or two of those types,” says Stacey R. Hanson ’10, Manager Emerita of the Radcliffe Choral Society. The level of excellence shared by all three of the choruses has been one of Marvin’s most significant achievements in his historic tenure.
“I wanted them to sound equal to each other so that there was this wonderful community of kindred spirits,” says Marvin, sitting in his Paine Music Hall office crowded with posters from past performances, an upright piano, and a towering bookshelf stuffed with sheet music.
He taxes his students, pushing for a level of excellence that some professional choirs never attain. In 2003, for a celebration of Marvin’s 25th year in his position, the choruses sang Beethoven’s “Missa Solemnis.” The performance required an unprecedented amount of dedication, but elicited an effusive wave of praise from its audience. It received a glowing review from the Boston Globe: “Beethoven’s bursts of scurrying fast-tempo polyphony were as sure, swift, and unimpeded as mere human agency could make them,” wrote correspondent Richard Buell, “additionally enlivened by the performers’ awareness (visible in their faces and demeanor) that they were indeed daring the impossible.” Marvin was praised throughout the piece. “It was the kind of conducting that has a lot of ‘there’ to it but somehow disappears, egolessly, into the music,” Buell added.
Marvin, however, credits most of the success of the choirs to the students’ own talents: “I think it’s that kernel [of musical knowledge] that excites students, because if they know they can really grab it and own it,” he explains. “I’ve taught the students in each of these choirs how to hear and therefore how to take the responsibility of how to fix.”
Even to the untrained ear, the sound of the Holden Choirs is impressively unified and unique. Marvin is renowned for his unparalleled talent in choral direction, and he is also credited with the creation of a particular ‘Harvard sound.’ Marvin’s long-time friend Kevin C. Leong, the Associate Conductor of the Holden Choirs, sees this musical achievement as one of Marvin’s greatest.
“It’s basically a total refinement of all components of what you hear. Everything is aligned and there’s attention given to alignment of vowel and perfect tuning and balance,” Leong says. He adds, “Jim teaches his students how to listen and how to adjust what they sing according to what they hear in order to create the perfect sound. It’s very compelling. It’s a beautiful sound and it’s one of his priorities to create that sound, sounds that people don’t hear every day. It’s the difference between a chorus and a bunch of people singing together.”
In essence, Jim is a musician who has the ability both to play and to sculpt his instrument, and the students in the choirs are the most essential part of that instrument.
“One of the things he teaches is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” says Isabel W. Draves ’91, a Collegium alumna and Chair of the Jim Marvin Retirement Celebration Weekend. “It’s something that’s really useful at Harvard; it’s really about the team effort and not the individual at all.”
MARVINCUES
“They were the Holden Choirs before, but it was more an internal name that was used. It was not, as it is now, an external name,” Marvin says. The Choirs were initially known as the Holden Choirs simply because the groups all used the Holden Chapel as a rehearsal space. Under the exuberant direction of Marvin, however, the Holden Choirs have become a cohesive entity within the school.
“Holden is a real community of singers, so I’m not just friends with people in Collegium,” says Allison S. Brandt ’10, President of Collegium Musicum, “I’m friends with everyone else.”
Marvin has been successful in creating the immeasurably close community of the Holden choruses due to his sincere interest in developing close relationships with his students. “He genuinely cares about the students in each of the three groups,” says Kristina R. Yee ’10, the Radcliffe Choral Society Historian. “I think that Jim is a very fatherly conductor figure.”
Students across the three choruses fondly discuss the ‘Marvincues’ he holds at his house three times annually. These feature the infamous ‘Marvinburgers,’ a burger so thick that it’s charred on the outside and rare on the inside, and, during the ‘Christmascues’ of yore, Marvin’s festive eggnog.
The stories from the Christmascues especially are so heartwarming that they would be a welcome addition to anyone’s holiday experience. Piling into school buses on a cold winter’s night, the members of all three Holden Choirs drive the half-hour it takes to reach Marvin’s house in Lexington, Massachusetts. There, they bask in the glow of the fire that Marvin tends (carefully, as if it were the fourth Holden chorus), drink eggnog, and converse with his oft-referenced wife Polly.
After an initial period of comfortable conversation, the three choruses, totaling over 100 students, crowd around Marvin’s piano to practice Christmas carols. Then they take to the streets of Lexington, caroling for the neighbors and hurling snowballs at each other, weather permitting.
For many, the Holden Choirs become the dominant aspect of their social scene; they provide lifelong friends and constitute the most memorable part of college. Some alumni joke about the fact that they came to several choral reunions before attending a class reunion. “My parents would accuse me of concentrating in Glee Club, minoring in the band and occasionally taking classes,” said nostalgic alumnus David F. Jackson ’82.
This tight-knit community only strengthens in the intense rehearsals for which Marvin is known. Even the lengthiest rehearsals are rendered bearable by Marvin’s fierce energy and ridiculous teaching-phrases, known as Marvinisms. The singers collect these bizarre phrases in their music, send them out over email chains, and eventually create year-end books with pages devoted to them.
“These usually don’t get explained ever,” laughs Molly C. Storer ’11, manager of the Radcliffe Choral Society. “Sometimes they get explained at the beginning of the year but he uses them so often that it gets to the point where he could say something that seems totally random to anyone outside of the [Holden Choirs], but we know exactly what it means and respond to it.” When a chorus isn’t grasping a passage, Marvin shouts, waves his arms and utters seemingly incomprehensible torrents of nonsense. This seems slightly ridiculous until the chorus tries the passage again—and performs it infinitely better than they did before Marvin’s outburst.
“Every rehearsal, I’m constantly kept on my toes—there’s nothing boring about rehearsals with Jim,” says Brandt. “He’s loud, and crazy, and funny, and energetic, and sometimes scary, but just to get us to do something that would be outside our comfort zone to make the music better.”
A commonly cited Marvinism is his advice for singers trying to hit a high note: “You’re either pregnant or you’re not.” He also frequently refers to “Santa’s bag of psychological problems,” the baggage that a distraught Santa carries around, which prevents him from effectively carrying out his job. He encourages students to leave their bags on the roof.
LEGEND AND LEGACY
Tales of Marvin have been passed down from students too, and they form the subtext on which his unusual rehearsal demeanor sits. Storer passed on a popular story from a Radcliffe Choral Society tour, which featured a karaoke bar in Tennessee, an RCS rendition of “I Will Survive,” and—most importantly—Marvin’s unbuttoning his collared shirt, unveiling his neon pink t-shirt, and swinging the former over his head as he danced.
These stories are so deeply ingrained in the institutional memory of the Holden Choirs—a  memory that stretches back further than the Crimson’s archives—that whenever a Holden singer discusses anything that the choruses have done, they’ll use the first person plural. As a result, 19-year-old students with laptops in bag and cell phones in pocket develop a verbal tic of referring to high jinks they enjoyed during the late nineteenth century or early 1970s.
In many ways, the history of the Holden Choirs mirrors that of Harvard. From the creation of Collegium, which coincided with the merger with Radcliffe, to the lyrics’ change in gender in Charles Gounoud’s “Domine Salvum Fac”—the song that is traditionally sung at Harvard Presidential Installations—to accommodate current President Drew Gilpin Faust, the Choirs have participated actively in Harvard history.
These deep historical roots help produce the remarkable alumni culture surrounding the choruses. The alumni of the groups are extremely committed; almost five hundred alumni of Marvin’s Holden Choirs plan to return for the Holden Reunion Weekend. The weekend will kick off on Friday with a joint performance of all three Holden Choirs called “A Celebration of the Career of Dr. Jameson Marvin.” The concert will feature the premiere of “Song of Awakening,” a piece commissioned from the composer Robert Kyr for the occasion.
Gann says Marvin creates common ground between current and former Holden Choirs participants. “When I talk to alumni, I know that we have this common background of having been a part of producing the same sound and that’s a pretty special historical connection,” he says. Draves voices a similar sentiment. “You meet these people and you’ve never seen them before in your life, but you instantly have something in common with them because you know so many of the same songs and when you sing something with someone you have an instant bond,” she says.
Marvin possesses a rare combination of natural leadership skills and musical dedication.  In his social and musical legacy, he has set a precedent that will not be easy to maintain. The college has organized a search committee to find a new director, but they have yet to reach a decision.
GRAZIOSO
Marvin has both perpetuated and altered the rich history of the Holden Choirs in his time here. Widely credited with the creation of the Pan-Holden community, and critically acclaimed for his unparalleled ability to bring the three distinct choruses to an equal skill level, Marvin has technical achievements and community-wide accomplishments sufficient to satisfy anyone’s criteria for a fulfilling career. Still, he doesn’t consider any of these accomplishments to be his greatest achievement—or his motivation for staying in the same position for 32 years.
At the end of a forty-five minute interview with Marvin, I am well aware that—despite his patience—I am making him terribly late for an important engagement. With feverish swipes at my laptop track pad, I scan through my unending list of questions for one that would grant me access to some greater truth about Marvin’s career. Flustered, I turn to him and ask simply, “What will you miss most?”
Without a second thought or a moment’s hesitation, Marvin, who opened the interview by describing himself as “verbose” and prone to “rattle on and on,” answers, “the students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Responding to the economic crisis and ensuing political corruption that hit Argentina in 2001, the poor, unemployed citizens of Buenos Aires took to the streets to sell cardboard. Two years after the chaos, an informal publishing house called “Eloisa Cartonera” opened to buy cardboard from cardboard-pickers called “cartoneros,” and to create “libros cartoneros,” books made with cardboard covers. This movement was born out of economic necessity and creativity, showing that literature can help build community.
Inspired by the cartonera model, the Paper Picker Press has run educational workshops encouraging people to engage with literature and take ownership over it since 2007. At 2 p.m. on Friday in CGIS, the Press will run a book-making workshop exposing attendees to the revolutionary idea that hatched this successful social and economic project.
The terms that the Press uses to describe its project confront the standard top-down model of literary education. They call the creative interpretation of literature “intervention,” and teachers “facilitators.” “If this is a revolution,” says Doris Sommer, a Professor of Romance Languages and Literature and African and African American Studies, “it’s in the spirit of [Marxist thinker Antonio] Gramsci—of reformism through cultural practices, because it gets people to read and write at a high level, in which creativity and critical thinking are recognized.”
The Press encourages active engagement with high-level texts through its activities. “The program can change the culture of school,” Sommer says. “When you develop critical thinking and understand it through the arts, you’re in fact changing the world simply by trying to understand it.” True to the project’s Latin American roots, the students write “literature de cordel,” understanding an existing work by writing their own version of it, and hanging it on a clothesline.
The Press is part of the Cultural Agents Initiative, a project which advocates for active humanities, and of which Sommer is the Faculty Director. “What we’re saying here is that the humanities are a field that can create and promote effective interventions, because it trains and promotes judgments and an exercise of possibilities. Most humanists would be averse to thinking of the humanities as a field for preparing you for other things—that the humanities should be fixed on purposelessness, on disinterested art. The whole mission of Cultural Agents... is about reviving, linking up again the mission of civic development of the humanities. The humanities used to be the obvious place for citizenship preparation,” Sommer says.
The Press believes that the concepts and skills one can develop by actively using the humanities are necessary for civic engagement, mirroring part of the mission of the Harvard Task Force on the Arts. “Giving people outside of Harvard an understanding that the arts are vehicles of exploration is a way of underlying the importance of arts in the development of the curriculum. All of the issues that the Arts Task Force are communicating come alive in an immediate and practical way with the Paper Picker Press. Arts become a way of interpreting, exploring, rehearsing ethics.” Sommer says.
Marcela Maheca, the Executive Director of the Cultural Agents Initiative, says that the Press uses the arts to take risks. “If you put a mission to the arts, it’s going against the tenets of the field,” she says. “That’s the risk they are taking.”
“It’s a new way to think about teaching,” says Tyler A. Brandon ’12, who has adapted the methods of the Press to the PBHA group South Afterschool Boston, whose curriculum she coordinates. Brandon was inspired to do so by the Press’s “new creative solution to get kids reading by drawing and visual arts, drama, photography, music, and dance.”
The Press’ emphasis on lateral, reciprocal action and risk-taking helps make them revolutionary. Maheca says the group is aware how difficult it is to do this. “My personal experience is how the community here perceives Harvard—how they are not interested at all,” she says. “By being able to go down lower, and speak with them... in the same language, and bring something sophisticated into their own words, it’s also a risk. Organizations don’t like to feel that they don’t understand what you’re saying. What we’re doing is crossing the bridge.”
In doing so, the Press demonstrates that “our partners outside of the university are quite as sophisticated as our partners inside,” Sommer says. “To show people that they’re already sophisticated or can be, just by making art, is part of the bridge that we’re making with the community. It’s not top-down. It’s really reciprocal.”

It’s not often that the arts at Harvard cater to freshmen exclusively, but a new program called the Freshman Arts Collaborative Experience Showcase (FACES) hopes to do just that. FACES brings together seven members of the Class of 2013 in a collaborative environment to create an original exhibition for Arts First weekend.
The diverse group of freshman artists involved with FACES has spent the spring semester creating a unique, interdisciplinary showcase of artwork. The event—titled “Who We Are”—focuses on the theme of identity, and will run on April 29 and 30 in the Ticknor Lounge in Boylston Hall.
The program’s creator, Rory Michelle Sullivan ’09—a freshman proctor and Graduate School of Education student—led the seven students of FACES throughout the semester. Sullivan says she conceived the program in the hope of creating a space for collaborative artistic exploration where students could hone their skills and also learn about other arts forms.
“The idea of FACES was... not to stick disparate art forms together, one on top of the other, but to really teach and learn from each other and meld the art forms together into something greater than each individual part,” Sullivan wrote in an email.
After an application process in the fall, the freshmen involved in FACES spent much of the second semester participating in what Sullivan calls “community-building arts workshops,” creating work to be presented at the Arts First showcase. The end product will be a unique event, according to Sullivan: “It will be a multimedia living art exhibit of music, acrobatics, photography, film, painting, and live performance exploring the concept of identity.”
Through this study of identity, the students have developed significantly, according to Sullivan. “Freshmen often don’t have a chance to be in charge of this much of such a large undertaking,” she writes. “Since each of the FACES team members co-creates and is in charge of a significant aspect of a large project, seven new arts leaders have been created.”

As Harvard exhibits the full diversity of its artistic talents this Arts First weekend, the campus’s Native American community is making sure to display its contribution to Harvard’s culture. On Saturday, Native Americans from the student body and beyond will gather to demonstrate their continued strength and cultural achievements in the 15th Annual Harvard University Powwow, a traditional honoring of Native customs.
“The powwow is a celebration of native songs and dance,” says Steven H. Abbott, Associate Director for Recruitment and Student Affairs at the Harvard University Native American Program (HUNAP). “It’s really about celebrating the community that’s here at Harvard, as well as the larger community here in the Boston and New England area.”
The powwow aims to both bring Native Americans together and to welcome in people who may have far less experience of these events. Cesar Alvarez ’13, an event organizer who is affiliated with the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara tribes, says that one of the Powwow’s key goals is to show the importance of native culture to Harvard. Since this year marks the 15th anniversary of the Powwow, the 40th anniversary of HUNAP, and the 360th anniversary of the signing of the Harvard Charter—which stated the young university’s commitment to educate American Indians as well as Europeans—this year’s iteration offers a special chance to commemorate the importance of Native Americans to Harvard’s history.
“We want to remind everyone that, first and foremost, Harvard was an Indian college when it first existed,” Alvarez says. “We’re definitely trying to raise more awareness, and I think we’re doing a good job.”
Abbott agrees that the Powwow is an excellent means to show the continued importance of Native Americans in contemporary culture. “It’s very important for people to understand that native people are their friends, their colleagues, their coworkers,” he says. “Often native communities are locked in people’s opinion in an historical context, so that’s one of the things we hope people will take away. We hope they’ll see their peers in a slightly different context.”

Herbert, Hopkins, Goethe, and Dostoevsky are only a few of the voices that C.K. Williams conjures in his new collection, “Wait.” In one poem, he applies fertile Hopkins-like music to descriptions of dust and destruction, while in another he re-imagines a scene from “Crime and Punishment” in which Raskolnikov notices a “Jew on a Bridge.” But even as he takes on the styles or subjects of canonical writers such as these, Williams manages to consistently maintain the gentle, witty, and honest voice that he has spent a lifetime crafting.
In “Wait,” Williams does not limit himself to a single theme or style. He meditates on subjects ranging from war to desire, from nature to literature. While he often employs the long, fluid lines characteristic of so much of his work, as in his poems “Brain” and “Apes,” he also tries out more chiseled, succinct forms in poems such as “Vertigo” and “Rats.” Even as he displays his virtuosity as a writer, however, Williams remains humble and unassuming, calling himself at one point “a long-faced, white-haired ape with a book, still turning the page.”
This awareness of his age, his accomplishments, as well as his shortcomings recurs throughout the collection. Williams’ reflections on his work more often than not lead him to a kind of melancholy. In “Apes,” he wonders, “Could I have passed through my own golden age and not even known I was there?” What is more, Williams acknowledges the wide breadth of his literary knowledge, but also hints that such erudition is not necessarily satisfying or comforting. In the same poem, he writes, “It occurred to me I’ve read enough; at my age all I’m doing is confirming my sadness.” Reading, after all, brings him not only to the study of the poetic voices that influence him, but also to the confrontation of political issues that crop up throughout his work, from Roe v. Wade to the war in Iraq.
Williams’ politically motivated poems, which display his deep engagement and discouragement with contemporary affairs, are nevertheless not the most compelling ones in his collection. Rather, the most riveting moments in “Wait” come from Williams’ autobiographical ruminations, which give his reader glimpses of the past out of which this careful, quiet poetic personality has evolved. Though it is hard to imagine this wise voice as a wayward student, in one poem, Williams disparagingly describes the self of his school days: “I was an indifferent student; I fidgeted, / daydreamed, didn’t do my homework, didn’t / as my teachers often said, apply myself.”
Elsewhere, Williams recollects his relationship with an old mentor. “I suppose I understand now what drove him: all artists know times when the gates close, / or when everything you continue is despoiled by haste,” he writes. As Williams revisits his earlier memories, he eloquently shows the thought process behind his revisions of his understanding of his own life. Though as a young man the actions of his mentor seemed unfathomable, from this end of his career, Williams is able to understand the older writer’s paralyzing lack of confidence.
In no poem is the evolution of self-doubt more apparent than in “I,” in which Williams directly addresses the idea of lyric subjectivity. After referring to Goethe as “One of those ‘I’s who aren’t truly at one with themselves, / who in construing themselves betray the ‘I’ they could/should have been,” Williams implies that his own “I” is, like Goethe’s, not entirely trustworthy. However, although he casts doubt on the reliability of this subjective “I,” it is in fact the apparent genuineness of his voice that makes his work throughout the collection so transfixing.
But even amidst his contemplations of selfhood and subjectivity, Williams also continually returns to the vivid observations that give his work such buoyancy. In “Riot,” Williams evokes the music of dawn’s approach after a tumultuous, sleepless night: “The first dawn crows / sound like humans imitating crows, / but hungrier than crows, or more afraid. / The rising light gilds / then slashes red the fallow fields.” Throughout “Wait,” Williams consistently reveals perceptions of the world unique to his own alert senses. In “Teachers,” the poet imagines a schoolroom at night, after both students and teachers have returned home: “Come dusk, the classrooms emptied, / the book shut tight, those forsaken treasures / of knowledge must batter the fading blackboards / and swarm the silent, sleeping halls, / like shades of lives never to be lived.” It seems here that Williams is wondering whether his own work will eventually rest unheard and unread in closed books and dark classrooms. One can only imagine, however, that a voice this full of candor and sensitivity will remain audible and appreciated for a long while yet.

It is a little-known fact that when the Carpenter Center was designed in 1959, the sidewalk that cuts through the building was intended to be the main pedestrian route between Harvard Yard and the rest of campus, whose expansion beyond Prescott Street was planned but never realized. The purpose of this, according to architect Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris), was to force students to walk through a space for the arts on a regular basis, and in so doing, to make art literally more central to life at Harvard. Last year, the Task Force on the Arts argued that the arts remain peripheral on Harvard’s campus. In its second year, the Harvard Student Art Show attempts to address this perceived marginalization. The show features 120 pieces from 76 artists, primarily Harvard students.
“Our mission,” says co-director Alissa E. Schapiro ’10, “is to really show the visibility and importance of visual arts on campus. It’s not just in VES, and it’s not just at the Graduate School of Design. Harvard students are incredibly talented. There are ceramicists at the graduate school who would have no other venue to show their work. [The show] is a way of bringing together divergent communities that have a central focus on visual art.”
Shelby E. Doyle GSD ’11 agrees that the Art Show plays a key role in increasing awareness of the arts at Harvard. “It’s really great that they’re doing it, especially since Harvard isn’t always known for its presence within the arts. When I came here, I was listening to Drew Faust and she said that she was making the arts at Harvard a priority. It’s exciting to have this opportunity.”
Students involved with the show appreciate it as a unique opportunity to interact with other visual artists. David J. Tischfield ’09, an instructor for the Harvard Ceramics Program, participated last year and has two pieces in the show this year. “There are remarkable artists, painters and sculptors at Harvard,” he says. “I came into college as a rather established potter and sculptor, but I obviously couldn’t do that here. It wasn’t a very social club. This is one of the few ways on campus that I can share the thing that I do, my talent—my superpower, if you will.”
Schapiro and co-director Julia V. Guren ’10, who is a former Crimson illustrator, focused this year on catering to a variety of audiences. The show attracts Harvard faculty and staff, as well as residents of Boston and Cambridge. However, Schapiro notes that in the previous show, “most of the art that was affordable to students was gone the second we opened our doors. [This year] we wanted to have more works that were in the student price range, at 20 to 75 dollars.” To accomplish this, Schapiro and Guren asked the artists they anticipated to be the most popular to “edition” their works— to print five copies of the pieces, with unframed prints to be sold at lower prices than the original.
A minority of students expressed discomfort with the commercial aspect of the show. “In many cases it seemed like they selected pieces that were aesthetically pleasing rather than conceptually provocative,” says Intiya Isaza-Figueroa ’10, who is selling a collage and a drawing in the show this year. “There are, of course, exceptions. This is an obvious result of it being a show about selling student work to a broad audience. So while I see the point and am grateful that the show exists, I don’t think it closes the gap between quality work produced by students and the opportunities to show that work.”
Guren acknowledges this tension. “I was really skeptical of the sale aspect of the show last year,” she says. “But I was a volunteer the day of [the event], and I was just blown away by the sense of community I saw for visual artists on campus. I think the sale component of the show is important. It adds a level of professionalism, and draws in semi-professional artists.”
“A big part of it is teaching [the artists] how to market themselves and their work,” Schapiro adds. “It helps artists understand that they can pursue a career in the visual arts, and gives them the tools to do that effectively right after graduation.”

Chuck Palahniuk’s fourth book in as many years, “Tell-All,” focuses on the mid-twentieth century world of celebrity, as seen through the eyes of an aging star’s personal assistant. The book is one part Bette Davis in “All About Eve,” one part “American Psycho,” and several parts not up to Palahniuk’s usual storytelling ability.
In most of the nearly dozen novels he’s published, Palahniuk has employed his unique, repetitive writing style to illuminate a hidden world—that of fight clubs, sex addicts, televangelists, pornstars, and so on. One of the pleasures of reading many of his books is asking oneself if his revelations involving drugs, sex, bombs, and world history are actually true.
With “Tell-All,” Palahniuk picks a subject with very little mystery left in it—Hollywood’s Golden Age and its decline. In a culture where the public is inundated with the 24-hour news cycle, paparazzi pulp, and celebrity gossip, an author is going to be hard pressed to capture an audience already exhausted with the idea of the tell-all tale, even if he is trying to lampoon it.
The book is narrated from the point of view of Hazie Coogan, the handler of aging actress and box office gold, Katherine Kenton. Though this pair is fictional, the world they occupy is full of real characters, although at the mercy of Palahniuk’s historical and anachronistic distortions. In the style of Patrick Bateman of “American Psycho,” Coogan’s narration is a constant barrage of brand names, celebrities, and historical references. The narrator self-consciously refers to this multiple times as “name-dropping Tourette’s syndrome,” and flipping through the pages, one sees that each and every name has been set in bold.
In the long run, this name dropping convention is frustrating because overall only about one of every three references are immediately identifiable by a modern audience. Here are just a few from one page: Stephen Boyd, Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Natalie Wood, Frank Powell, D.W. Griffith, Joan Leslie, Tallulah Bankhead, H.B. Warner, Max Steiner, and Louise Brooks.
What becomes increasingly frustrating about this is that Palahniuk uses these references as he builds images of scenes and characters. Understanding his references will surely enhance one’s reading of the story, but the amount of research left to the lay reader is simply too daunting for such a short book. One could imagine a future edition containing a compendium of glosses in the back.
Palahniuk takes his time at the beginning of the novel introducing the character of Katherine Kenton, who seems like a cross between Katharine Hepburn, Angelina Jolie, Elizabeth Taylor, and Lindsay Lohan. In the narration, Coogan discusses her own endless maneuvering to manage Kenton’s movie-star image, calling the actress, “my work-in-progress,” and adding, “My job title is not that of nanny or guardian angel, but I perform duties of both.” The reader follows as she juggles Kenton’s drug use, serial marriages, and generally surreal behavior and lifestyle.
About halfway through, as the plot of the novel gets rolling, a young man, Webster Carlton Westward III, enters Kenton’s life with seemingly suspect intentions. Just as happens often today, Westward positions himself for the opportunistic memoir, the “tell-all” of the title. At this point, Palahniuk proves he still has the incredible ability to build suspense and surprise his reader with twists, though the story moves toward a fairly predictable end, given his hints earlier in the novel. The book ends with Palahniuk’s penchant for the macabre, though there is a redeeming twist or two in a fashion typical of his writing.
Where this book succeeds most is on the level of satire. Unlike in his previous books, Palahniuk does not show his readers a secret or paranormal world, but instead takes one especially familiar to most modern audiences and exaggerates its flaws to significant comic effect. For example in one scene, Katherine Kenton decides to adopt a child, and after an extended perusal of infants, she decides that none of them go with her newly painted walls. There is a similar kind of witty iciness throughout, which gives off the air of certain modern celebrities under the guise of a distant era.
The fact that there are traces of the frenzy around Angelina Jolie or the death of Michael Jackson in this novel certainly make it stronger, but Palahniuk needs to take his satire farther if he is going to be successful with it. He absolutely has the ability to make something over-the-top, but he needs to be more fantastical than he is in “Tell-All” when he is only at his most farcical when describing hilarious sex scenes.
Like most Palahniuk books, “Tell-All” will probably satisfy the core readership of his books, though even they may be disappointed by the lack of Chuck’s usual revelations. Since starting his career almost fifteen years ago, Palahniuk has been a champion of the groundbreaking and the avant-garde. Though “Tell-All” may have been groundbreaking 20 to 50 years ago, it seems unlikely that it will resonate as much with an audience today—one that feels it already knows too much about celebrities.

“I’m a non-religious Jew, directing a musical about Jesus,” says Sam L. Linden ’10, director of “Godspell,” running in the Loeb Experimental Theater. This Stephen Schwartz musical is a retelling of the Gospel of Saint Matthew. “So, basically Jesus and the disciples,” says Linden. However, the production is working to take it outside of that context by using the story as just a starting point instead of focusing on its religious aspects.
According to Linden, “Godspell” is frequently produced in high schools and community theaters. “They do it because it’s easy to give a lot of different parts... Everyone gets to get a line, everyone gets to get a song,” Linden says.
This ubiquity does not necessarily encourage high-quality adaptations, and Linden says, “It’s done badly all the time.” He promises to give it a new angle. “We sort of recreated the show,” he says, “doing the essence of the script, but as if it was written today, as opposed to doing a piece from the 1970s.”
When asked to cite an example of the difference between this staging and previous renditions of “Godspell,” he says, “Let’s just say, there’s Jesus hanging out with some lesbians.”
The show aims to politicize the script, a move Linden sees as natural because religion is so politicized today. “We have some addressing of religious LGBT issues, we have some addressing of the repression of shame that is caused by the specter of organized religion,” he says.
Both of these issues highlight the ways in which the community and the institutions that serve it can become misaligned, and are tensions that Linden is looking to subvert even in the presentation of his play. For example, there is no line dividing the musicians from the actors.
“The musicians are the actors, are the performers, are the singers,” says Yi Jun Tan ’13, who will be playing Jesus. “The idea behind the staging is that the songs come spontaneously from the performers. It’s a group of people getting together and having fun,” Tan adds.
Even beyond blurring the line between actor and musician, Linden is aiming to blur the line between performer and audience. “This isn’t the kind of show where you sit down and the actors pretend the audience isn’t there. We’re going to talk to you, we’re going to shake you, we’re going to grab you up to dance, we’re going to try to get you on stage and have a sing along during intermission,” he says. “We want you to leave feeling you didn’t watch something, you participated in something.”                                                                                      —Staff writer Rebecca A.

Pericles
April 29 to May 1, 2010
8:00 p.m.
On its website, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club describes William Shakespeare’s “Pericles”—written in part by the much less eloquent George Wilkins—as a “rarely produced tragi-comic-histori-vulgar monstrosity of the Shakespeare canon.” A late and obscure work, “Pericles” tells the story of the eponymous prince of Tyre. According to Meryl H. Federman ’11, producer and president of the Hyperion Shakespeare Company (HSC), Pericles “is the great guy that horrible things happen to.” She continues, “In that sense, it’s kind of a dark, weird fairy tale.”
“Pericles,” the HSC’s annual spring Visiting Director’s Project, will be playing at the Adams Pool Theatre from April 29 to May 1. Each year the company invites a professional director from the Boston area to select and direct a Shakespeare play. This year’s pick is Adam Stone. “Adam absolutely gets this play, and knows how to use humor to really bring out the absurdity of the script,” Federman says. Stone saw potential in the tension and energy of Shakespeare’s and Wilkins’ joint work. “The script poses a lot of problems right off the bat, and the cast and I necessarily rose to the challenge to come up with exciting solutions,” he says.
Noah J. Madoff ’12, who plays Pericles, stresses that an innovative play like this one needs an innovative director. “This play has a cluttered, bizarre script that doesn’t follow the rules of normal Shakespeare—but Adam has been fearless in editing, cutting, and reworking the production,” Madoff says. Stone adds, “I just developed the production word for word from the script based on the images and references that filtered into my mind and that of the cast.” In addition to directing, Stone also sound-designed the entire production. “You will hear everything
from heavy metal to seductive songs,” Madoff says. Stone even extended his creativity to the props. “At one point, a microwave and a ‘soup-in-hand’ will appear on the stage,” Madoff says.
Stone also places importance on the ideas of his cast. “The ensemble process is very important to me,” he says, “and I casted students who could bring something unique to the final production.” Madoff notes that Stone is skilled in bringing out the best in his cast. “Adam is remarkably good at extracting from the script—and from us,
the actors—layers of meaning and context that you won’t necessarily see in the shallow, episodic plotline,” he says. Federman agrees: “We may not have had a promising production under different leadership, but Adam is the kind of director who can get people excited about a Shakespeare play, and an obscure one at that.”
Though “Pericles” has its dark moments, it is ultimately a comedy. “Pericles is just a normal guy who encounters the wackiest of the wacky, and humors us all as he navigates through the horror show of his travels,” Federman says.
“This production isn’t only Shakespeare like you’ve never seen it,” she adds. “This is a play like you’ve never seen it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Art is a discourse and language that the average Harvard student is rarely compelled to examine deeply, particularly if that student is in the midst of midterms and exams, or churning out papers and problem sets. It is precisely this problem that the Harvard Task Force on the Arts has sought to rectify. As the Task Force has affirmed, “To allow innovation and imagination to thrive on our campus, to educate and empower creative minds across all disciplines, to help shape the twenty-first century, Harvard must make arts an integral part of the cognitive life of the university: for along with the sciences and the humanities, the arts—as they are both experienced and practiced—are irreplaceable instruments of knowledge...” To this end, the Harvard Arts Initiative is presenting the event “Art-making=Risk-taking” this Thursday in the Ticknor Lounge at Boylston Hall from 3 to 5 p.m. This event is the culmination of a months-long attempt to maximize the presence of the arts in Harvard classrooms.
The event is an interactive showcase of 12 to 14 classes inspired and supported by the Harvard Arts Initiative. The Initiative includes freshman seminars, General Education and departmental courses, all emphasizing a strong focus on engagement with art and development of students’ understanding of what it means to create art. The classes featured in this event are only a few of the classes supported by the Initiative, and are intended to offer the viewer a cross-sectional view of the project.
Literature and Arts B-85, “American Musicals and American Culture,” taught by Professor Carol J. Oja, will be featured in the event, focusing specifically on a visit to the class by Lin Manuel Miranda, writer and composer of “In the Heights.” Miranda’s visit was documented on film and will be presented at the event. Miranda was an invaluable addition to the class, according to course participant Margaret E. Johnson ’11. “I thought it was one of the best classes we had. He was incredibly entertaining, and he made the class even more current and relevant, because his work is so current.” The class studied Miranda’s work as the culmination of a survey of American musical theater history and its political implications.
Culture and Belief 12, “For the Love of God and His Prophet: Religion, Literature, and the Arts in Muslim Cultures.” will also be showcased at “Art-making=Risk-taking.” Taught by Professor Ali Asani, students in the class experiment with differing media traditional to the Islamic world, such as calligraphy, mosque design and Islamic poetry. According to Asani, focusing on a more interactive and personal way of understanding Islamic art and culture is unusual and not without its challenges, but ultimately successful. As he says, “[The class has] convinced me of the effectiveness of the arts and literature as pedagogic bridges to understand the Islamic worlds. It may be useful to just my specific subject, but I think it may be useful to others. Arts are a fundamental aspect of the human experience and what it means to be human.”
Courses such as Culture and Belief 12 can compel its students to come to an individualized understanding and expression of a certain art. For that reason, the class and others like it are not for the faint of heart. As Professor Asani says: “Those [Harvard students] who are afraid of taking a risk are not likely to take a course like this, but the students who are open to challenging themselves would find this course rewarding.” Peyton G. Greenside ’11, a student in the course, agrees. “I really enjoyed the artistic projects in the class because they offer a new way to interact with the material,” she writes in an e-mail. “You gain something more when you not only study religion, history and culture, but use them to construct an original work like designing a mosque for an urban American environment.”
Art can sometimes seem like too abstract of a concept in the often quantitative academic environment of Harvard. In reality, however, the creation of art is simply another form of understanding and thinking. “Art-making=Risk-taking” celebrates a new direction in the pursuit of knowledge at Harvard.

“It’s incredibly low-key and incredibly fun. If for no other reason, go for the unique theatrical experience of being crammed into a tiny basement in Adams to watch five plays that didn’t exist a day ago,” says Matthew C. Stone ’11. He is referring to the 24-Hour Play Festival, produced this year by Stone, who is also a Crimson arts comper, and Megan L. Amram ’10.
The 24-hour Play Festival is a biannual tradition now in its 14th semester at Harvard. In the span of only a day, about 30 students write, rehearse, direct, and perform five short plays. Even more impressively, the fifth is often a musical with original songs.
The timeline of the festival is nothing short of a whirlwind. At about 6 p.m. the day before, the writers begin to write the plays, which they finish overnight. At 7 a.m. the next morning, the actors start rehearsing them with the directors. During the day the actors costume themselves, find crazy props, and then put on a show three times over the course of the night—this year at 7, 8:30, and 10 p.m. on May 1. Amram recommends the last showing because it is the wildest: “The plays get crazier and crazier over the night as the audience get drunker and drunker—I mean, more excited,” Amram says.
Indeed, it is practically impossible to predict what one will encounter on the Adams K-Space stage. Stone recalls that one year he was wearing hot pants while another actor came out in nothing but underwear, rubbing paint all over himself.
“Mostly because the K-Space is underground, the festival maintains that underground feel. But it’s not supposed to be a secret,” Amram says. She encourages people to come, calling the festival “a celebration of experimentalism and creativity that even people who aren’t [in] theater will love.”

Ballet Folklórico de Aztlán’s (BFA) high-energy performances often involve twirling skirts and snappy footwork. Dancers may wear rattles on their hands and candles on their heads, all the while flirting with their partners and with the audience.
“When we perform for other people who are familiar with the dance, there’s a lot of audience interaction, like yelling and chanting,” says former co-director, Marisol Ramirez ’10.
BFA, which was founded in 1961 by undergraduates to celebrate Mexican heritage through traditional dance, is one of the oldest cultural groups on campus. The group performs dances from across Mexico, although they mainly focus on pieces from the state of Jalisco.
Although they won’t be wearing candles in their Arts First performance in Lowell Lecture Hall this Saturday, BFA aims to introduce a lesser-known tradition to the Harvard campus. Former co-director Alejandra Beristain-Barajas ’10 says, “A lot of times we stick with Jalisco because we know it’s a crowd pleaser. People know the Mexican Hat Dance, but we’re trying to show other regions that haven’t been showcased as often.” One such energetic piece, “Zacatecano,” features men in tight charro suits and women in full skirts. It originates from the state of Zacatecas.
BFA thrives off its cultural value, which it believes instructs and entertains its audiences. “It’s not just a dance,” Beristain-Berajas says. “It’s a skit and a way of preserving culture and showing it to younger generations.”
Many members joined as inexperienced dancers who were simply eager to experience one form of Mexican culture. However, BFA’s Arts First performance combines the group’s cultural and artistic merit. “We’re usually considered a cultural organization, and this time we’re considered an art. We’re considered something that’s providing to the arts—the visual arts, the performing arts,” Ramirez says.
Though the Arts First audience will comprise a different crowd than BFA’s usual one—which normally consists of members of Harvard’s or Boston’s Latino community—current co-director Maricruz Rodriguez ’12 is excited for the opportunity to introduce BFA to a new group of spectators. “One of the reasons why people should come specifically to Arts First is because you’re exposed to a lot of different performance arts groups you don’t usually see,” Rodriguez says. “We know it’s a new audience for us, and it’s a really unique experience for them.”

Last Friday, Arizona’s Republican governor Jan K. Brewer signed into law the nation’s strictest bill on illegal immigration to date in spite of concern expressed by President Obama. Under the legislation, police may now detain individuals whom they reasonably suspect entered the United States illegally and authorities can charge immigrants with state crimes if they fail to carry proper immigration papers at any given time. In addition, it even grants citizens the right to sue their cities should they feel that the law is not being enforced strongly enough. While we understand that Arizona is arguably the nation’s most active hotspot for human and drug trafficking from Mexico, we nevertheless find its new immigration law entirely unacceptable since it can only lead to a heightened atmosphere of racial profiling.
What is perhaps most offensive about this new law is its dependence on the vague, highly problematic language of “reasonable suspicion.” This provision will permit police officers to arrest any individual they superficially judge to be suspicious, and it seems reasonable to suggest that such superficial judgments will only perpetuate the racial tension so deeply entwined with the issue of immigration in the U.S. In a border state such as Arizona, it is unfortunate that this new piece of ill-advised legislation will likely reinforce existing stereotypes and legitimize to some degree the de facto racial profiling that already troubles the region.
The law’s requirement that immigrants carry required papers at all times is an unnecessary inconvenience—one that seems designed as a trap that will simply make it easier to arrest a greater number of immigrants. After all, is it really reasonable to expect an entire immigrant population to carry around a host of bureaucratic documents during every daily activity? Also, the bill does not provide nearly enough protection of the right to privacy, which, while not explicitly included in the Constitution, has nevertheless been upheld by the Supreme Court. Finally, allowing citizens to sue their cities for being too lax on enforcement will accomplish little, and places an enormous amount of pressure on law enforcement officials to uphold the terms of the law. In fact, this particular provision could even lead to hyper vigilance, which would only increase the opportunity for unfounded discrimination.
On the subject of such discrimination, there is no telling just what sort of effect this bill will have on Arizona’s Latino communities, as police are now likely to stop people simply for looking Hispanic. Will Latinos still feel comfortable speaking Spanish, even in the sanctuary of residential areas? Will they still be able to celebrate their cultural heritage in a society that is meant to be pluralistic?
The passage of this bill does not appear to offer any economic gain. Since police officers will need training—and some citizens may, in fact, sue their cities—the new legislation will inspire high costs without the prospect of fiscal benefits in return.
What, then, is the point of this law? Regardless of its intended impact, it functions to enforce racial divisions already deeply entrenched in American society. Needless to say, Arizona’s new stance on illegal immigration does not constitute a constructive way to deal with the issue—an issue that certainly needs addressing. In the meantime, we can only hope that other states confronted with similar circumstances do not follow Arizona’s embarrassing lead.

Recently, Tea Party protestors swarmed Boston Common. But even before that they had laid claim to Boston and more so, to the Republican Party. Their turnout arguably contributed to Scott Brown’s election to the senate seat formerly held by Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, and although many Tea Party-supported Republican candidates have failed, most of the “Tea Party patriots” are staunch Republicans. However, the Republican Party would do well to steer clear of this extreme, disordered group.
What is sometimes called the “Taxed Enough Already” Party poses the danger of offering a slightly more libertarian alternative to the Republican Party. The Tea Partiers delve into strange territory with their discussions on the constitutionality of government, among other things. Their oft-regarded founder, Eric Odom, is a confused Libertarian-Republican, and his party followers seem to be the same. He has re-joined the Republican Party, it seems, only because it is currently the best avenue for the Tea Party’s cause; the Tea Parties are hardly a loyal branch or even ally for the Republicans.
In fact, Odom’s party is willing to contest the seats of current Republicans, including, it seems, Senator John S. McCain (R-Ariz.), the 2008 Republican presidential candidate and one of the most prominent and respected members of the Grand Old Party. During the first National Tea Party Convention this February, former Congressman, 2008 presidential candidate, and founder of the Tea Party Convention Tom G. Tancredo exclaimed that McCain was a repeat of “Bush one and Bush two” and “thank God John McCain lost the election.” Although this antipathy may have stemmed from Tancredo’s own primary loss to McCain, his words were met well by the convention attendees and its main organizer, Judson Phillips.
Because of the party’s hostility toward mainstream Republicans, it comes as a surprise to me that Republican Party Chairman Michael S. Steele has called himself a member along with prominent Republicans like Republican House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt L. Gingrich. Perhaps this is because the party is, at least, united with the Republican Party in their criticism of Congressional Democrats, big spending, and most importantly, President Obama.
Although this united opposition to the Democratic establishment is healthy for the Republican opposition, the Tea Party’s rhetoric is not. Calling the president of the United States a socialist is the type of extreme language the Republican Party needs to disassociate itself from, and using similarly harsh language toward Republicans in office or the idea of government altogether is certainly not conducive to a GOP electoral victory this fall.
The Tea Party’s methods also alienate mainstream Republicans. In April 2009, protestors threw boxes of tea bags at the White House—hardly patriotic. Unlike what some of the protestors’ signs contend, President Obama is not King George III. The colonists that the current “Tea Party patriots” profess to follow were rankling under taxation without representation under the Townshend Acts and the 1773 Tea Act. By melodramatically associating their movement against a democratically elected government with the fight against British imperialism, modern tea parties only belittle themselves by comparison.
The Tea Party movement adds more disunity to the Republican Party and has the potential of alienating the party even more from mainstream voters. I alternate between “party” and “parties” when referring to the Tea Party movement because the organization is a confusion of several groups. I am sure Republicans would not want to add such incohesiveness to their already-scrambling coalition. The popularity of these Tea Parties suggests that the Republican Party should articulate coherent policies of their own to reach out to unsatisfied masses instead of simply blocking Democratic attempts at reform—especially since Tea Parties include a sizable segment of the Republican voter base. This is unfortunate because the organization has proven that it has more potential to create revolutionaries than loyalists within the Republican Party.

Harvard  undergraduates and prefrosh have more in common than they should. This  past Visitas weekend meant the arrival of 1000  excited prospective students and, for many current members of the College,  memories of their own similar experience a year or years ago. To prefrosh,  Harvard can seem like a confusing place, and not just because of difficulties  in navigating the campus.
Then,  once the previously-bewildered enroll, Harvard life gets simpler, the  intuition runs. Foreign names like “Mather” eventually take on a determinate geographic  location, class schedules are ironed out, and these once-unaware students  figure out what it means to be at Harvard.
But  the last part of this story, unfortunately, only sometimes holds true.  When, for example, the Class of 2014 accepts their offers, they will  join a community, but it’s not at all clear what identifies our community  here at Harvard.
The  easiest reply is that students join a community of learning. While the newest members of the undergraduate  class are, according to Harvard’s admissions website, supposed to “pursue excellence in a spirit  of productive cooperation,” such lofty language appears markedly out  of place given the rest of Harvard’s judgments.
Dig  a little deeper and you’ll find that Harvard hesitates to say explicitly  that such a common bond unites us. Undergraduates’ latest institutionally-sanctioned  educational philosophy comes from the Report  of the Task Force on General Education.  The task force’s framing of its new set of requirements fall  well short of a claim to excellence. “The general education curriculum,”  the authors admonish, “does not pretend to constitute  a comprehensive guide to everything that an educated person should know.  There is simply too much information to cover.”
Yet,  the task force’s modesty concerning anything an educated person should  know prevents it from establishing any sort of educational standard.   If you were to read through the rest of the Gen Ed report, you’d find  that the task force never does get around to saying whether there is  any specific content whatsoever that an educated person should know.  Officially, Harvard will not even broach the topic of whether specific  information is necessary for education, let alone declare in what way  excellence comes from academic study. In general, the language of this report centers on a rhetoric  of preparation, not a rhetoric of common pursuit with one’s fellow  students.
Academics,  then, probably isn’t the common thread. Maybe there’s another unifying  element to the Harvard experience. Yet the other list of possible candidates—athletics,  extracurricular activities, and community involvement—are subject  to even more division and are less likely to focus students around a  common goal.
This  appraisal might seem correct, but some readers might not take issue  at Harvard’s individualistic approach. After all, it seems that the  idea of community at a university is not appropriate in today’s spirit  of modern equality. Each student, free to make of his time here what  he wishes, can, as the College’s admissions video reminds its viewers, make academics “whatever  you choose it to be.” The same could be said, then, of every other  component of student life as well.
Harvard’s  official outlook, to be fair, does mention “late-night talks and dinner-table  debates” as an important element of undergraduate life. Presumably,  the collegiality present in these informal interactions could drive  education at the College. However, to raise student collegiality to  the level of the lecture hall would come precariously close to making  academics not “whatever we choose it to be” and instead a matter  of a common search for understanding—one that can’t be left at the  exit of the classroom.  This collaboration might then serve as  an unofficial limiting of each student’s self-direction of study,  and counteract the administration’s insistence on autonomous determination  of academics.
In  this manner, collegiality and individuality exist in tension, for the  truly sovereign student does not need the input of his fellow classmates.   Harvard, as a result, will tolerate but remain uncomfortable with an  approach that emphasizes interdepenence, since collaborative efforts  have as their logical prerequisite a common understanding or goal.   Prefrosh and students are alike in this respect in that however long  students remain on campus, a community of learning never coalesces around  a shared pursuit.
Answering  the question of “what makes a student educated?” without reference  to specific content is a good way to ensure that academics do not serve  as the basis of community. The modern university seems uncomfortable  with the language of common pursuits. Instead, as the Gen Ed report will remind us, education is about  my ability to respond to the changing world as I, not the community,  sees fit.
The  Harvard approach to student life is motivated by a strong individualism  that enervates attempts to establish a community, since the idea of  community requires that each of us not make college life “whatever  you choose it to be” and instead identify a common end as worth pursuing,  whether that’s in or outside of the classroom.  It’s for this  reason that college undergraduates are no wiser than prefrosh—spending  time here doesn’t really tell each individual what Harvard life is  all about. Instead, Harvard purposefully structures its attitudes and  educational rhetoric to comment only on each person’s life  as it matters to the student, but certainly not to the wider community.  A collection of nominally associated individuals can affect powerful change in the world at large, but not the  shifts in attitude that would establish collective striving within.   Without this last change, community at Harvard will remain up to individuals’  efforts to forge it,  For prefrosh and undergraduates alike, membership  in the wider Harvard community will remain a nebulous concept.

Martin Heidegger was no Steve Martin. Pictured on the back cover of his seminal tract, “Being and Time,” with frown and furrowed brow, it’s difficult to imagine this German phenomenologist cracking a joke. Yet, this fall, mulling over his magnum opus for class, I eked out a few laughs at his expense. Encountering impossible semantic permutations of the word “being”—capitalized and uncapitalized, infinitive and participle, singular and plural—I took to narrating the most esoteric examples aloud. What else could I do with a phrase like “Being means the Being of beings”? So abstract, Heidegger’s words seemed completely hollow—devoid of meaning, else hyper-meaningful in ways that eluded my 20 year-old brain. Faced with the daunting task of reading 80 pages in 10-point font, all I could do was laugh.
Heidegger, I surmise, would not have been amused. Amongst his academic aficionados, such an act marks me as intellectually unserious or even blasphemous. I like to think that my laughter was neither of the two: Innocuous in tone, it evidenced the basic—and, at the time, insurmountable—fact that I simply had no idea what Heidegger was saying. To me, “Being and Time” was philosophical Dada, the Jabberwocky stripped of satire and iambic meter. Sure, the work possessed some semblance of sense, its sentences cohering in the internal logic of English grammar. Recited with intonation and interspersed with caesura for dramatic effect, the book’s claims certainly sounded significant. Yet, despite its enigmatic profundity, I could not help but impute a certain absurdity to Heidegger’s prose. For all I knew, “Dasein” might as well have been Orwell’s “two plus two equals five.”
Chuckling at academic writing has a long history. In 419 B.C., Aristophanes derided Socrates’s philosophizing as opaque and specious. Today, a website—the Postmodern Generator—crafts a new grammatically correct and vaguely coherent scholarly article, complete with footnotes and a fake department, each time the viewer hits refresh. (“The Consensus of Collapse: Baudrillardist Simulacra in the Works of Debord” by Ludwig M. Werther, Department of Gender Politics was a recent output). And, up until 1998, the journal Philosophy and Literature held an annual Bad Writing Contest which celebrated “the most stylistically lamentable passages” in recent academic work.
Judith Butler, a professor at U.C. Berkeley best known for theorizing gender as performative, recently received the journal’s accolades for a 98-word sentence—which, admittedly, was entirely inscrutable. Several months later, Martha Nussbaum, herself a feminist academic at the University of Chicago, penned a scathing critique of Butler’s oeuvre for The New Republic. Through its “ponderous and obscure” prose, Nussbaum argued, Butler’s writing created “an aura of importance,” which “bullied the reader into granting that, since one cannot figure out what is going on, there must be something significant going on.” In reality, Nussbaum contended, Butler simply rehashed stale concepts: Obscurity filled the void engendered by her lack of substantive content. Exhausted by deciphering Butler’s prose, the reader had little energy (or patience) remaining to assess the veracity of her claims. Nussbaum further assailed Butler for what she deemed “bad-faith feminism.” Retreating from political engagement to self-indulgent scholarship, Butler’s gender politics proved decidedly hollow. “Feminism demands more and women deserve better,” Nussbaum concluded.
Arbitrating the in-fighting amongst contemporary feminists, Camille Paglia chimed in against both Butler and Nussbaum, would take tomes, not a column. What is clear, however, is that some philosophers—particularly those grounded in the Western Continental tradition—engage in an almost compulsive drive to make complicated. Replete with cryptic neologisms and allusions, the writings of Butler and company often leave the reader as mystified as Alice in Wonderland. Yet, the fault does not rest solely with the authors: Readers too indulge the tendency to speak in intellectual tongues. Stand in an abstract art gallery, even one filled with blank canvases, and the din of theoretical citations overwhelms. Viewing these works that appear eminently simple, the spectator finds not nothing, but rather, a surfeit of things that could be said. Ultimately, as my art history professor jests, modernist art appears to partake in one long inside joke to which the spectator is not party.
Upon joining the Mad Tea-Party, Lewis Carroll narrates, “Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to her to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. ‘I don’t quite understand you,’ she said, as politely as she could.”  Coming into section that week, where recourse to parody seemed ill-advised, I was forced to admit the obvious: Heidegger’s concept of being was far beyond the grasp of my own. Three lectures and one final exam later, I had managed to reconcile with the philosopher who enjoined his readers to eschew philosophical abstraction on his own breathtakingly abstract terms. If we were never going to be friends, at least I could respect his monumental intelligence for what it was—equal parts profound and abstruse.
In the end, beyond elucidating the question of being, Heidegger taught me that all academic disciplines are forms of gibberish—specialized lexicons that must be mastered before they can glean any insights. Each is comical in its own way, whether through overzealous use of the word “being” or too much C++.
Perhaps, after all, it’s not so bad just to laugh.

A recent study published last week by a Harvard Medical School research team links napping and dreaming to enhanced memory.
Subjects who sleep after memorizing a 3D computerized maze are better at navigating the maze several hours later than those who did not nap, according to Erin J. Wamsley, a research fellow in psychiatry at the Medical School.
While earlier studies have supported the idea that sleep aids in memory consolidation, Wamsley said that the team was particularly interested in studies where rodents showed identical patterns of neural activity both when navigating through a maze and when sleeping afterward. The researchers, led by Medical School psychiatry professor Robert A. Stickgold, sought to investigate this phenomenon in humans.
"If these memories are replaying during sleep, is that going to be consciously experienced?" Wamsley said.
The control group remained awake throughout the experiment and showed difficulty navigating through the maze after the break. The experimental group napped between memorizing and navigating the maze and showed improved performance, according to the study.
More importantly, said Wamsley, experimental participants who spontaneously reported dreaming about the maze showed markedly better performance.
According to Wamsley, the subjects who dreamed about the maze generally performed below average on the first task and performed on par with the rest of the participants for the second task. But after controlling for the poor baseline performance of the dreaming group, their improvement was significantly higher than the other participating groups.
Wamsley said she thought that the initial poor performance of the dreaming group "could be causing them to both dream about it and improve a lot later."
She added that it is possible that the group dreamed about the task because their brains classified the information as important, not necessarily because they deemed the task difficult.
Students said the results of the study helped to confirm something they intuitively knew to be true.
"I find that taking a break from work and taking a brief nap refreshes me and helps me focus better," Rishabh K. Sinha ’12 said. "I think there are diminishing returns to forcing yourself to focus for extended periods of time."
Sinha wasted no time applying the study’s findings to his daily routine. After the interview, he said, "I’m going to go take a nap now."

A modest number of people attended the Cambridge City Council meeting last night to urge the passing of a calendar item and a policy order.
During public comment, several Cambridge residents voiced the need to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The requested charter right was passed unanimously.
Other residents attended the meeting to ask City Council members to pass a policy order that will encourage workers of the Shaw’s distribution center and management—which is owned by SUPERVALU neighborhood grocers—to "return to the bargaining table" to arrive at a "fair and reasonable" contract.
More than 300 Shaw’s workers have been on strike for the last six weeks and lost their health benefits on April 1. The Council unanimously agreed that Council members would go on the record to have both parties involved in the dispute—the United Food & Commercial Workers Union, Local 791 and SUPERVALU—come to "fair and reasonable" negotiations.
Additionally, Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 led a resolution to congratulate the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College on their 40th anniversary. He said he attended their concert earlier this month, and also mentioned at this meeting that he was a member of the then-newly established group of Kuumba singers 40 years ago.
Though the city budget has been released, dates for reviewing it have been set for early to mid-May. City Manager Robert W. Healy briefly attended the meeting.

 Harvard Medical School Professor Marie-Louise Jean-Baptiste has been highlighted in the Harvard magazine Focus for her efforts to increase recruitment of minorities to medical school, spread cultural awareness to medical residents, and increase access to health care for the homeless.
The article in Focus—a biweekly journal covering the Harvard medical community—praised Jean-Baptiste’s accomplishments within the community as well as her remarkable life story.
Jean-Baptiste, a physician with the Harvard-affiliated Cambridge Health Alliance, grew up in Haiti and was forced to adjust to a new mode of medical practice after arriving in the United States.
Her recent efforts center around educating medical students about how to interact with patients who may present cultural barriers.
As director of CHA’s Health Care for the Homeless program, she is also pushing for increased dental, psychiatric, and pediatric care for the homeless.
CHA Associate Residency Director Pieter Cohen has worked closely with Jean-Baptiste on recruiting minority residents and said that her efforts are paying off.
"We have one of the most vibrantly diverse residency training programs in the area," he said.
According to Jean-Baptiste, Health Care for the Homeless is facing difficulties with understaffing and funding shortages due to the recent financial crisis.
As a result, the program has been seeking out volunteers with experience in social work and even just compassionate students to care for homeless patients.
Jean-Baptiste said she often attempts to reach out to nurse-practitioners as well as inpatient social workers in team meetings to discuss specific cases, patient discharges, medical issues, projects, and troubleshooting, and her colleagues have noted this compassion permeating her work and teaching.
Cohen described Jean-Baptiste as one of his favorite teachers when he was in his residency, calling her "very warm, open, and compassionate human being first" and a "remarkably talented...and amazing doctor second."
CHA Director Richard J. Pels offered similar praise, saying that Jean-Baptiste’s "teaching is very much in demand."
"There are lots of us who are happy to have a chance to speak on her behalf," he added.

Harvard affiliates and other members of the global health community in New England gathered at Boston University yesterday to discuss the future of global health.
The symposium, co-sponsored by Boston University, Harvard, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, discussed the strategies outlined in a CSIS commission report entitled "Smart Global Health Policy: A Healthier, Safer, and More Prosperous World."
The report—released last Thursday, one year after 25 commissioners joined together to brainstorm a long-term plan for the United States’s role in global health—outlines steps to be taken over the next 15 years in a five-part plan. These strategies include maintaining the commitment to the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; prioritizing women and children in U.S. global health efforts; strengthening prevention and health emergency response capabilities; ensuring that the U.S. has the capacity to match global health ambitions; and making smart investments in multilateral institutions.
Yesterday’s conference was the first of a nation-wide series aiming to discuss both the ideas presented in the report and the United States’ role in global health.
Peter R. Lamptey, a commissioner of the report and the president of Public Health Programs at Family Health International, said during the symposium that the value of this report lies in its commitment to a longer period of responsibility. In addition to addressing health from an international perspective, the plan seeks to keep developing countries in the conversation to address mortality, Lamptey said.
As for the future of global health, the symposium recognized that the next generation already has the necessary foundation to sustain efforts in the long term.
"Your generation understands the global world that we are in and, more importantly, the need for global health," said Jeanne Shaheen, the current New Hampshire senator who once served as director of the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The same idea was extended when five students from Boston University, Brown, Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth presented their current research in global health-related topics.
Among the students was Amy K. Bei ’03, a doctorate candidate at the School of Public Health who spent a year in Tanzania, where she developed a method for conducting reverse genetics in the human erythrocyte.
The symposium was also attended by other Harvard affiliates, including University Provost Steven E. Hyman and School of Public Health Dean for Academic Affairs David L. Hunter.
Robert A. Brown, president of Boston University and Michael E. Capuano, representative in Congress for Massachusetts’ eighth district, were also in attendance.

 Rose B. Styron, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center and a prominent human rights activist, held an informal conversation about her life experiences with an small audience in the Kirkland House Senior Common Room last night.
At the event—sponsored by the Harvard College Human Rights Advocates, the Institute of Politics, and Kirkland House—Styron told stories about joining protests with college students in Germany, being invited to a secret meeting of Poland’s underground resistance movement with author Kurt Vonnegut, and attending the Amnesty International World Concert Tour with Peter Gabriel and Bruce Springsteen. "It was the most fun I’ve done with anything in my life," Styron said.
Stryon, who started out as a poet, said she first became interested in human rights after an Afro-Asian writers’ convention in Russia and then joined Amnesty International.
"I’d met all these writers [who] had all of their incredible, dreadful experiences, and were such extraordinary writers and human beings themselves that I got drawn into their stories," she said. "And when I came back here to the United States, I couldn’t get anything done for them, and then found Amnesty International."
Tyler A. Brandon ’12, co-organizer of the event along with Joanna I. Naples-Mitchell ’10, said that Styron’s experiences could help Harvard students learn more about human rights campaigns.
"She brings her personal experiences from working for over three decades across the entire world and many continents," Brandon said. "She gives students insight into those missions and what you can do with the resources we have at our disposal at Harvard with a passion for human rights."
Former Harvard Advocates Co-President Quinnie Lin ’09 said that Styron’s stories have already had an impact on her career choices.
"I heard her speak last year during my senior year of college and her words were part of what inspired my career choices as a human rights activist," Lin said. "It’s hard to sometimes get a sense of these real heroes like Rose Styron who go out and do human rights work in the field."
Last night’s talk marks the second time Styron was invited to have an informal conversation with Harvard students.
"I think the event tonight was very inspiring just like it was last year," Lin said. "I never cease to be amazed when I hear her speak."

 Harvard University participated in derivatives trades with Goldman Sachs in 2007 that exposed the University to losses as the real estate market collapsed, according to e-mails released by a Senate committee yesterday.
According to the e-mails, Harvard entered the $500 million credit default swap—essentially an insurance policy that would pay off in the case of mortgage defaults—with Goldman paying about 100 basis points, or $5 million, per year for protection against defaults.
As the real estate market soured, credit default swap rates increased to 200 basis points, and Goldman stood to profit from the trade while Harvard, as a counterparty, suffered losses.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake said in an e-mail yesterday that this trade was part of an investment strategy that is "no longer pursued" at Harvard Management Company, which invests the University’s endowment.
It is unclear how much Harvard lost on the trade.
The emails’ release comes just days after Goldman was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with misleading investors about a pool of mortgage-backed securities that later lost significant value.
The firm has come under increased scrutiny in light of allegations of acting against its clients’ interests by speculating against the housing market while continuing to structure mortgage-backed securities for investors.
On Feb. 22, 2007, Goldman managers directed traders to close out positions that bet on a decline in the housing market in order to reap large profits for the firm at a time when many investors were suffering huge losses from their exposure to real estate.
"We need to buy back $1 billion single names and $2 billion of the stuff below—today." Daniel L. Sparks, the former head of the firm’s mortgage division, wrote to a group of traders in reference to deals—including the one with Harvard—that would lock in profits from shorting the housing market. "I know that sounds huge, but you can do it—spend bid/offer, pay through the market, whatever to get it done."
"You called the trade right, now monetize a lot of it," he added in the e-mail.
On April 16, the SEC alleged that Goldman misrepresented to investors the involvement of hedge fund manager John A. Paulson—who famously made billions through bearish bets on the housing market in 2007—in assembling a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities that he later bet against.
Goldman has vigorously denied charges of fraud.
But Goldman CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75, who is speaking before a Senate committee today, admitted that the public could perceive the firm’s actions as an example of uncontrolled Wall Street speculation.
"We have to do a better job of striking the balance between what an informed client believes is his or her investing goals and what the public believes is overly complex and risky," Blankfein said in prepared remarks released yesterday.

Several speakers explored the relationship between alcohol and sexual assault at last night’s talk "Rape or Sex with a Buzz?" as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month and discussed the difficulty in distinguishing victim and felon in rape cases involving alcohol.
Susan Lewis, Senior Communications Advisor for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, said that alcohol-induced physical and cognitive impairments can complicate a situation.
"The assumption is often that the woman was drunk and the man was not at fault," she said, adding that the victim is often blamed for appearing promiscuous or not putting up a fight. "In the face of general and even legal acceptance of violence against women, we need to work to change attitudes and laws, and individual awareness is especially important."
Wendy J. Murphy, a criminal justice system expert, also spoke about the legal difficulty of determining what constitutes rape, especially when alcohol is in the picture, rebutting arguments that a case in which two people are equally drunk—and thus equally unfit to make decisions—cannot be considered rape.
"Two equally incapacitated people are not suffering the same harm," Murphy said. "People have the right to know what it means to make the choice to have alcohol or drugs and either impose yourself on another or submit to having sex."
She said that the law offers protections for inanimate property—for example, if a person is too drunk to sign a contract about his or her house, the contract is considered involuntary and therefore null. But the law falls short in terms of evaluating consent regarding autonomy over one’s body.
"Every person has 100 percent authority to decide who touches them," Murphy said. "To say that someone was drunk so she deserved what she got deflates that 100 percent authority."
She also said the argument that a man was intoxicated and didn’t mean to commit rape similarly diminishes the woman’s right to her body.
"In these cases, she loses fundamental autonomy over her body, and he loses an erection," Murphy said.
Michael D. Burks ’11, a member of the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response’s Advisory Committee, said that consent is the most important consideration.
"Consent IS sexy," he said, referring to the Sexual Assault Awareness Month t-shirts. "There’s nothing wrong with asking, but having that conversation is something people shy away from because they think it’s going to interrupt the flow of the night."
He added that being an active bystander can help both women and men in potentially risky situations.
"People need to watch out for each other," Burks said. "Whether you don’t want to intrude on another person’s rights or you don’t want to get in trouble, it’s important to be aware."

The Economics Department recently gained authorization last week to push for a new concentration advising structure for the next academic year that would see three of the current seven graduate student advisors replaced by one staff member dedicated to concentration advising, according to Economics Department Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron.
The plan approved so far, which is only part of what the department hopes to implement in a larger-scale redevelopment of concentration advising, would grant concentrators one key staff member whose time will be devoted to undergraduates’ concerns, Miron said.
"While our past advisors have dedicated energy to their jobs, they were also students," Miron said. "When you have someone’s job is to be an advisor, there’s an obvious benefit in that specialization."
Miron said that the plan would also provide the benefits of continuity in advising and ease in identifying a point person for advising issues.
"Students will be working with one person, instead of graduate students who will ultimately graduate," Miron said. Having a level of "identifiability"—having one person instead of three—will also help students be more comfortable approaching their concentration advisor, he added.
Currently, the department hopes to add at least two staff concentration advisors in the next few years.
As of yet, according to Miron, the costs associated with additional staff hires may not increase the total expenditures of the current concentration advising program.
"We might be spending less on graduate students and more on staff, and it’s unclear if we’re going to be running much higher costs," Miron said.
Miron added that he did not think that any potential addition to expenditures would "crowd out faculty hiring."
This actual plan comes after a few years of discussions of changing the advising structure, which Miron said was "appropriate" given the prolonged nature of vetting proposed structural changes.

Harvard has entered an agreement with the Egyptian government to provide need-based financial aid to Egyptian graduate students pursuing careers in public service, an initiative which is funding three masters students this year.
The agreement, signed in October 2009, supports Egyptian citizens living in Egypt who wish to pursue a masters degree at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Graduate School of Education, or the Harvard Design School; to attend executive education programs; or to take courses at the Harvard Summer School.
According to the Harvard International Office’s statistics, 12 students from Egypt currently attend the University—a disproportionately small number for a country of more than 80 million. In comparison, Lebanon, a country with a population of just over four million, currently has 23 students enrolled at the University.
The initiative to increase the number of Egyptian students at Harvard was spurred in large part by the experience of Egyptian government officials who have benefited from an American education.
The current Egyptian minister of finance, who received his doctorate from MIT after taking classes at the Harvard Summer School to qualify, and the current cabinet minister, who graduated from the Design School, were instrumental in putting this agreement in place, according to Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez.
"The agreement reflects in part their own biography and the need to improve the capacity of leaders in the government," Dominguez said.
Last year’s agreement set up a $10 million fund, but it is unclear what its current value is after the past year’s financial uncertainties.
The University is collaborating in a similar way with Chile and South Korea.
Harvard’s agreement with South Korea, which was originally signed in 1975, had to be renegotiated last year after much of the funds for that program—which was intended to support professors—went unused because the University had no plans to endow new professorships in the East Asian Studies department.
Such a situation—where the University has funds but is unable to use them because of legal restrictions—has been a common problem in recent years, according to Dominguez.
"My nightmare is to sign an agreement and then have no Egyptian students be admitted," Dominguez said. "Fortunately, that didn’t happen."

For the Harvard women’s sailing team, this weekend brought a do-or-die situation. Finish in the top half of the field at the Reed Trophy, and the Crimson would be guaranteed a spot in the postseason. Finish outside the top seven, and the season would be done.
But Harvard surpassed even its own expectation, finishing second and earning a berth in the ICSA Women’s National Championship.
“Our main goal was just to qualify for semifinals,” sophomore skipper Emily Lambert said. “So it was really exciting that we were able to go above and beyond our goal and qualify directly for nationals.”
The co-eds finished near the top of the pack in their final tune-up before next weekend’s national qualifier regatta, placing sixth out of 18 teams at the Thompson Trophy.
REED TROPHY
It came down to the last race, but the Crimson women stepped it up at the right time, beating Boston College to the finish line in both divisions in the Reed Trophy’s 10th race.
Harvard finished the regatta, hosted by Brown, in second place, just three points ahead of the Eagles, to grab the second and final automatic bid to nationals.
“The weekend went really well overall,” Lambert said. “This was the one chance we had for women’s to qualify for nationals.”
The consistent performance of Lambert and sophomore crew Alex Jumper in the A division propelled the Crimson to take second in the event for the second-straight year.
Though the pair didn’t win a race all weekend, the sophomores placed outside the top four just once—a ninth-place finish in Saturday’s final race.
“We were really excited by it,” Lambert said. “We were just trying to in every race make sure that we worked as hard as we can to minimize the number of points we got, and luckily we were able to be really consistent. It was something we’d struggled with in the past, so it was nice to iron it out this weekend.”
In the B division, senior Liz Powers and sophomore Marie Appel placed in the top three in five of the 10 races, including two wins. The pair finished fifth in the division.
“They sailed really well, we were really psyched,” Lambert said. “We’re just really pleased with it. It was a good team effort.”
At the regatta’s end, the quartet took home not only an automatic trip to nationals—bypassing the semifinal round—but some individual hardware as well.
Jumper and Appel were named to the NEISA First Team as crews, while Powers and Lambert made the second team as skippers. Powers was also honored with the league’s Sportsman of the Year prize.
THOMPSON TROPHY
Despite finishing in the top third of the field, the co-ed team walked away from the Thompson Trophy, hosted by the Coast Guard Academy, feeling disappointed.
“In my mind, it was a pretty mediocre performance,” junior crew Meghan Wareham said. “But I was happy that we did have some good races. There was good competition there. It was good to sail against some people outside of New England after the New England Championships last weekend.”
Wareham and junior skipper Alan Palmer racked up three second-place finishes through the 13-race regatta, coming in sixth in the A division.
“We had some very good races, but a lot of bad ones too,” Wareham said. “It was definitely tough conditions, but you can’t blame that. We had some major mess-ups at the start—we need to work on that this weekend at semifinals.”
Junior John Stokes skippered the B division boat, with senior Michelle Konstadt and junior Quincy Bock splitting time at crew.
The boat finished in the top six six times on the weekend, placing fifth overall.
But the co-eds focus lies squarely on this weekend’s opportunity to qualify for next month’s national championship regatta.
“What we need is to put in two solid performances this weekend on both days, keep it consistent,” Wareham said. “We don’t have to be winning races to qualify, but that would be nice.”
PRIDDY TROPHY
While the upperclassmen were sailing in the weekend’s big intersectionals, a pair of rookies stayed close to home, taking second place in the all-freshman Priddy Trophy, hosted by Mass Maritime.
Ryan Byrne and Alma Lafler finished second in a 14-team field, beating out third-place Brown by three points. Vermont won the regatta easily, amassing 49 points through 14 races.
Skipper Byrne and crew Lafler won three races, finishing as runners-up twice.
BU TROPHY
Sparked by a second-place finish in the A division, Harvard took seventh at the BU Trophy.
Junior skipper Colin Santangelo and sophomore crew William White, who is also a Crimson news editor, won two of the four races to finish four points behind A-division leader Vermont.
Freshman skipper Sam Millham and sophomore crew Caroline Lowe did not have as much success in the B division, finishing 10th.
NORTHEASTERN TECH INVITE
A quartet of sailors spent Saturday on the Charles, taking fourth in the local-level Northeastern Tech Invite.
Senior skipper Ali Beyer and sophomore crew Grant Wonders took seventh in the A division, while the freshman duo of skipper Nick Waldo and crew Nicholas Gordon took third in the B division.

Talent is something gained through hard work, practice, and dedication. But for freshman Jeff Molinari and his siblings, talent is something that runs in their blood.
Molinari is the fifth child in his family to stake his claim on the college lacrosse field. His sister, Morgan ’06, and brothers Shane ‘08, Cullen ’09, and Terrence ’10, have played at Notre Dame, UMass, Georgetown, and Duke, respectively. Madison, the youngest of the bunch, is now a freshman in high school playing on her high school varsity lacrosse team.
The lacrosse bug hit the Molinari children at a young age.
“When we moved from New York to Florida in ’89, I bought them all little fiddlesticks, which is like a lacrosse stick that you can play with in your pool,” said Mr. Molinari, Jeff’s father. “Then when we moved [back to New York, we moved] to Manhasset because of lacrosse, and I kind of pushed them that way… and they actually went for it, and then we got the family all involved.”
Between the spirit of the town and having each other for encouragement, it was no wonder they all got hooked.
“There was a very deep tradition of lacrosse [in Manhasset],” Mr. Molinari continued. “It had… a very good youth program where all the college guys who played would come back and raise their families, so there was a very good support for the town. At a young age, they already had great teachers in the sport.”
“I always liked to play,” Jeff said. “My older [siblings] always played so it was natural that I played with them… around the house or in the backyard.”
With all the athletes in the house, there was a strong, supportive environment that motivated Jeff to succeed in lacrosse.
“I looked up to [my older brothers], so I definitely pushed myself in the sport and wanted to pursue it because of that, but I also enjoyed it a lot.” Jeff recalled. “When they were in high school, they were all on the same team [that] won the state championship, and in 2004, they were the number one team in the country, so that really motivated me to get where they were, but even before that, I was playing and really had a passion for it.”
That passion allowed Jeff to make his own mark on the field. He made his high school’s varsity team as a freshman and would go on to earn all-county honors his junior and senior year. He also was a two-time All-American finalist and won the state championship in his senior year. Off the high school pitch, he played as a member of the competitive Empire State Games lacrosse team.
His success gained him the attention of several college coaches, and Jeff needed to decide if he wanted to play at the same college as one of his brothers or to go his own way.
“I was considering going where my brothers went, but I wanted to do my own thing,” Jeff said. “It would have been cool to play with my brother Terrence at [Duke], but I just liked what Harvard had more… like the coach, the team, Boston, being in an urban city… and the education is top to none.”
“Our offer to him was to do something really different, to go to a program like Harvard and to carve out your own identity… to be Jeff Molinari, and not anyone’s younger brother,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “I think he’s really doing that. Being a freshman and playing as much as he’s doing, which is incredible, I think people have a tremendous amount of respect for him… and that’s a credit to his hard work and dedication.”
In his rookie season, Molinari is definitely not living in anyone else’s shadow and is making a name for himself as a valuable player on the Harvard squad.
“He’s done a great job,” Tillman said. “He’s a guy who is very consistent in terms of his approach and his demeanor. He never seems to get rattled… and he is very, very intelligent when it comes to the athletic IQ… His versatility is really important to us, and it certainly has helped us so far this year.”
Even though Molinari has followed in the footsteps of his siblings when it comes to his love of lacrosse, he has forged his own path as a valued individual on the Crimson.
The fit has been a win-win situation for everyone.
“It’s been great so far; it’s been a lot of fun,” Jeff said. “The people on the team are awesome and are my best friends, the coach is really good, and it is something I look forward to every day, whether it is a practice or a game.”
“I think it would have been really easy for him to just go where his brothers went, but that’s not really him,” Tillman said. “He’s the type of guy who loves to take on challenges and broaden his horizons, and I think that’s one of the reasons why he took to Harvard… We are certainly thankful that he decided to come this way. We wouldn’t be having some of the success this year we’ve had without him. He’s been a very important guy for us.”

When a team splits every single weekend, is it a model of inconstancy or just the opposite? Whatever it is, the Harvard baseball team (14-22, 7-7 Ivy), which has split every weekend that it has played league opponents, must change its course in order to keep the Crimson’s hopes for the Ivy League playoffs alive.
Saturday seemed like a perfect opportunity for Harvard to break the trend. After two disappointing losses to Brown (12-25, 9-5) the Sunday before last, the Crimson put up convincing victories over the Bears the next day—including a 9-0 blowout in which junior Max Perlman and freshman Andrew Ferreira combined for a five-hitter with no walks. Even with a Beanpot loss, Harvard seemed to have more than enough momentum to break its streaking habit with dominant wins over Yale (17-19-1, 4-10), the last-place team in the Rolfe Division. One game into the doubleheader, the Crimson was right on track. But the goal of a sweep was soon derailed when the Bulldogs scored seven runs in the first inning of game two and rolled on to a 15-1 win, facing few challenges in the process.
“It was a missed opportunity,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said at the time. “We know that we have to sweep the doubleheader.”
But despite Walsh’s and the team’s understanding of the urgency of the situation at hand, Walsh insists that Harvard hasn’t tightened up or recoiled in the face of inconsistency.
“I don’t think anyone is feeling any pressure,” Walsh said. “We’re all playing nice and loose.”
In some sports, that might represent a lackadaisical attitude, but for the Crimson baseball team, it actually makes sense. Despite its mediocre record, Harvard has demonstrated time and time again that is has all the talent it needs to get the necessary victories to make the Ivy League tournament. The team has had strong offensive outbursts from its leadoff batters down to nine-holer Kyle Larrow, and has had intimidating performances from a plethora of pitchers, including Perlman, Ferreira, junior Eric Eadington, and sophomores Brent Suter, Marcus Way, and Will Keuper.
“Every time we get a good outing, we seem to put it together,” Walsh said.
But though the rotation has proven talented, it has been far from consistent as well. Despite numerous strong performances on the mound, the Crimson has also had plenty of regrettable ones, most notably a 24-1 loss to Columbia (19-17, 10-4) on Apr. 11.
But luckily for Harvard’s hurlers, they have the luxury of working with experienced players in the middle of the field in junior captain Tyler Albright and juniors Sean O’Hara and Dillon O’Neill. In its preseason release, College Baseball Insider named Alright and O’Hara the best defensive players in the Ivy League at their respective positions. Meanwhile, Albright and O’Neill were both All-Ivy Honorable Mention a year ago.
“Our strength is in the middle,” Walsh said. “We have an excellent catcher, a terrific shortstop, and a great center fielder.”
Luckily for Walsh, two of those players—Albright and O’Hara—have also proven to be powerful at the plate this season. O’Neill hasn’t had the same offensive success this year as last, when he batted .322, but Walsh said the junior has been dominant in the outfield—especially this past weekend.
“[O’Neill] had a tremendous weekend last weekend,” Walsh said. “[He made] a pro-catch. He has the potential.”
But while O’Neill looks for his sophomore swing, he has plenty of younger teammates who are just as comfortable with the bat as he was a year ago. Sophomore Jeff Reynolds leads the team in batting average (.352), hits (44) and slugging percentage (.504), while classmate Marcus Way leads the team in on-base percentage at .431 and walks with 22. The older O’Hara is right behind the pair, standing at second in batting average (.323), on-base percentage (.411), and walks (19), while slugging at a .476 clip for third-best on the team. Reynolds and Albright are tied for the RBI lead with 21, and O’Hara leads the team in runs with 27. But while such a balance is impressive, it’s hardly telling the whole story as the Crimson has seen strong offensive outbursts from all of its hitters
“Even Kyle Larrow, who’s down in the nine hole, he had a couple outstanding games,” Walsh said.
So there’s really no question that Harvard has the talent to make the Ivy League tournament, and with a doubleheader against Yale coming up tomorrow, the team has another opportunity to take control on the field and roll into its weekend games against Dartmouth (19-13, 9-5) with momentum. It just has to make strong performances a certainty rather than a question mark. And should the Crimson succeed in making the tournament, its raw talent alone over the course of the season indicates that Harvard can make it all the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James Williams could soon be getting the chance to suit up at Raymond James.
After not being selected in this weekend’s NFL Draft, the Harvard star left tackle has signed an undrafted free-agent contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he will compete with three other undrafted free agents to make the team as a backup offensive lineman.
Making the Bucs—who already have five offensive tackles on their current roster—will be no easy task for Williams.  Many scouts feel Williams is a better fit at guard in the NFL, so if he can learn the position, his versatility could become a major asset.  The three other linemen the Bucs signed–Eastern Kentucky's Derek Hardman, Tennessee's Vladimir Richard, and Virginia Tech's Sergio Render–are all rated higher by ESPN's Scouts Inc., so any advantage Williams can get over his competition will be extremely helpful.
For the time being, Williams becomes one of five Harvard football players on NFL active rosters.  The others are Ravens center Matt Birk, Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, Packers quarterback Chris Pizzotti, and Raiders defensive tackle Desmond Bryant.
Williams had been projected as a mid-round draft pick at points during his college career, until inconsistent production during his senior year and a poor pro-day showing (5.54 40-time, 16 bench press reps) hurt his stock.
But the three-time All-American will put that behind him starting this weekend, when he will be in Tampa Bay for the Bucs’ minicamp.  There, Williams’ technique will be tested in a hurry, as he’ll have the formidable task of going up against Tampa’s first two draft choices, defensive tackles Gerald McCoy and Brian Price.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Jeremy Lin doesn’t get  to play professional basketball, maybe Harvard fans won’t have to wait as long  as they thought for the next Crimson baller to make it to the pros.
Considering  that Columbia’s Judie Lomax just signed with the WNBA’s Connecticut  Sun, it doesn’t seem too far of a stretch that Harvard junior Emma  Markley, who twice thwarted Lomax in the Crimson’s two wins over the  Lions this season, will have a chance at the pros before it's all said and done.
Lomax sits second in the all-time  rebounding category and tenth in all-time scoring after only two seasons  of playing for Columbia. The forward also set the Lions’ single game  rebounding record when she put up 27 against Brown on March 6. Clearly a talented player.
But Markley had her number this season as  the junior put up more rebounds and blocks than Lomax in both  contests. In the second meeting between the two, Markley blocked a Lomax shot that  would have sent the game into overtime in a 69-67 win on February 20  in New York.
While some are overjoyed to see  Lomax—who has one semester of eligibility left—heading to the WNBA  because it means that they won’t have to play against the 2010 Ivy League Player of the Year anymore, Markley might be happy to see the  Columbia forward headed out for a different reason.
She could be next.

Prefrosh snaked through the Student Organization Center at Hilles to grab goodies from tables manned by members of 167 different student organizations Sunday. We at FlyBy decided to do a little review of the clubs and their antics.
Best Food
Harvard Model Congress's tomato-basil pizza from Noch's beat out the Three Muskateers and Snickers that crowded other tables. Sadly, this FlyBy correspondent managed to overhear some disgruntled prefrosh complain about the food, with one saying, “God. I’m going to die if I have to eat this ever in my life." Apparently, she had yet to try Annenberg food.
Best Performance
Running up and down the stairs wearing baby costumes, dresses, and sartorially clashing outfits, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals took the stage in terms of pep and enthusiasm. Prefrosh must have been thankful that they didn’t show too much spirit.
Best Weapon
The Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association's female members carried swords made out of cardboard and other house supplies. “We’re calling [the routine] ‘Cute Girls with Large Swords,’” Tatyana V. Avilova ’13 said.

Next time you’re in a rush to run to lab or turn in a problem set in the Science Center, be sure that you don’t let your hurry prevent you from holding the elevator. You never know when the person you don’t hold the elevator for will physically assault you for your “rude” behavior.
This past Saturday night, Boston police broke up an altercation at 1050 Tremont St. when two women punched, kicked, spat on, and beat a man with their handbags after he did not hold the elevator door for them, according to an article on the Boston Herald's website.
The man was also attacked with a plate of pasta. When the police arrived they observed noodles dripping off of Mohammed Warsam. The victim said he threw water bottles at the woman to defend himself. But we think it might have been more productive if he had saved the water to rinse the noodles off of his body.
The police characterized the women as “extremely agitated,” “uncooperative,” and “verbally abusive toward officers,” according to the article. The women, Kenyana McQuay and Waltia Funches, ages 27 and 28 respectively, were both summoned to Roxbury District Court on assault and battery charges.
The take-home lessons here are clear. Hold the elevator door for people, keep your anger in check, and don’t waste leftovers in petty squabbles. It’s little considerations like these that can keep you out of court and your clothes pasta-free.

Summer is coming up, which means two things: it’s time to find the best spots to fix that unnatural pallor you’ve gotten from spending your days indoors and it’s time to find ice cream to counter the soon-to-be searing Cambridge heat.
In this subjective and unscientific review, we’ll give you the lowdown on where to get the best ice cream based on a sample of the $4 vanilla ice cream cups at four different Harvard Square ice cream parlors.
4th Place. Lizzy’s Homemade Ice Cream
This two-store chain has the boutique appeal that a large chain like Ben & Jerry’s lacks, but the ice cream leaves something to be desired. The friendly cashier said that the regular sweetened vanilla contained Splenda and was “mad good.” But we found ourselves overwhelmed by the artificial sweetness. The ice cream didn’t really taste natural, and the texture could be described as “brittle.”
Rating: Unremarkable (4/4)
3rd Place. Ben & Jerry’s
If you’re willing to dive into the depths of the pseudo-punk faux-postmodern world of The Garage, you’ll be rewarded with a great cup of ice cream for around $4. The vanilla ice cream here was great and boasted a nice, natural flavor, but after half a cup we felt ourselves yearning for a sweeter experience.
Rating: Pretty good (3/4)
2nd Place. Baskin-Robbins
The Baskin-Robbins/Dunkin Donuts combo seemed questionable, but the ice cream itself assuaged any fears that there was intermingling between egg sandwiches and the ice cream. The ice cream was delicious—it tasted sweet like Lizzy’s but the sweetness was more comparable to the natural sweetness of a fruit than the unwholesome sweetness of Splenda. The texture was fairly standard—it didn’t conjure up images of a majestic cow in Vermont, but didn’t get in the way of the experience.
Rating: Delicious (2/4)
1st Place. J.P. Licks
This is the ice cream that made us think not of a majestic Vermonter cow, but the beautiful bovine of India. After the transcendent experience of eating this ice cream, you’ll understand just how deep that imagery was. The vanilla ice cream represents a perfect union of creamy texture and full vanilla flavor, and after we finished our cup, we felt ourselves yearning for more.
Rating: Flawless (1/4)

April is the month for fashion shows with a cause, it seems, and on April 13, the Harvard Business School’s Retail and Apparel Club hosted its 7th annual HBS fashion show at Mantra, a restaurant in downtown Boston. Every year, the fashion show aims to raise awareness for a selected charity “through the lens of fashion,” according to a press kit for the fashion show.
This year, the students celebrated beautiful people, beautiful clothes, and beautiful bodies in an effort to raise awareness for this year’s charity, the Harris Center for Education and Advocacy in Eating Disorders at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Despite the irony of a fashion show benefitting the prevention of eating disorders, the show attracted a large crowd and sold out the venue, according to Harbus, the HBS weekly student-run newspaper.
The attendees had the pleasure of watching models saunter down the runway in designer duds from a broad range of labels including Marc Jacobs, Marchesa, Banana Republic, and DKNY. These couture brands weren’t worn by professional models, but instead by 35 HBS students and their partners—including former beauty pageant winner Miss Malaysia 2009.
Harbus reported the organizers treated their guests to goodie bags filled with fashion essentials, including make-up, coupons, sample sized fragrances, and the zero-calorie, zero-guilt beverage Skinny Water.
Watch a recording of their fashion show here.
