After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seated in the back of his parents’ van, Enrique Ramírez ’16 felt a surge of panic as the blinding red and blue lights of a police car blared behind them. Enrique and his parents had just moved his older sister into her dorm at the University of Texas at Austin. Driving back to Houston, his father had unknowingly crept over the speed limit. The family escaped with only a speeding ticket, and the officer moved on. As the police car drove away, Enrique sighed with relief. He, his parents, and his siblings are all undocumented immigrants to America. Had the officer inquired further, their routine traffic violation might have led to deportation.
Natives of the central Mexican state of San Luis Potosí, Enrique’s parents decided to move to the States in 1996, driven primarily by a grave devaluation of the peso in the early-1990s and the resultant rise in their debts. In his attempts to recoup some of their losses, Enrique’s father moved to Houston, Texas to work alongside his brothers in the petroleum industry. But having discovered the better quality of education that existed in America, he stayed, bringing his wife and children over on visas that quickly expired.
At the time of the northward trek, Enrique was only two years old. “Everything I know about San Luis Potosí, my extended family, my culture, and my family’s transition to the United States, I learned through my parents,” he recounts. “I do not have any memory of Mexico whatsoever, which is kind of weird for me, because it is the country of my citizenship.”
Enrique’s childhood was typically American: he joined the Boy Scouts (eventually becoming an Eagle Scout), attended church regularly, and dreamed of one day enlisting in the Air Force. He developed a strong sense of patriotism and appreciation for the States fostered by his parents’ comparisons of how much better life was in America than in Mexico.
“Knowing that my parents were willing to give up everything that they had in Mexico, were willing to never see their own parents again, only reaffirms for me how much better life in America must be.”
But realizing the legal disabilities imposed by his status as an undocumented immigrant, Enrique began to feel a sense of disillusionment, trepidation, and above all, alienation. During his childhood and adolescence, he never once spoke publicly about his status. Writing his admissions essay for Harvard, an opportunity many use to tell their immigration stories, Enrique left the issue aside.
Upon his arrival in Cambridge, though, Enrique recognized the necessity of opening up about the experiences and needs of undocumented students. Reconciled to the prospect of deportation, and inspired by the Obama Administration’s 2012 “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” directive, he “came out” as an undocumented immigrant in the pages of The Crimson. In a later piece he published in support of an Undergraduate Council referendum on immigration reform, Enrique detailed the routine difficulties he encountered because of his status. His interactions with friends and teachers, he wrote then, were marred by “fear, secrecy, a sense of being undeserving, illegitimacy, invisibility, and a heavy form of guilt.”
Choosing to write under his name and not anonymously, Enrique hoped to ease the coming out process for other undocumented undergraduates. “My family was mad at me at first because openly acknowledging our status was something totally unheard of for them, but I felt compelled to speak out and give a voice to the many students in my situation who had similar fears about opening up.”
Since coming out, Enrique has joined several immigrants’ rights organizations on campus. During his freshman year, he co-chaired an immigration policy group at the Institute of Politics, working to outline improvements to Harvard’s support structure for undocumented students. His work, along with that of others, led to the appointment of Dean Emelyn dela Peña as the University’s first administrator to be given the specific task of assisting undocumented immigrant students at the College.
To help undocumented students adjust to life on campus, Enrique has also started a mentorship-based support group in which undocumented freshmen and upperclassmen are paired together. “There were times freshman year before I came out when I would just cry because I felt like I didn’t know what to do when I needed help,” he remembers, adding that he also hopes to launch an awareness campaign in the coming months to demystify common misconceptions about undocumented students.
While his future and, indeed, his ability to stay in America remain uncertain, Enrique is committed to continuing his advocacy for immigrants’ rights.
“Being undocumented is a struggle, but I see it as only one struggle among the many others that Harvard students face. Sometimes people feel like they can’t come out, that they have to face the challenges alone. I had lived my whole life hiding. I hope to help other people to be open, to look for help if they need it, and to be more comfortable in coming out.”

When I’m not churning out these biweekly pieces, I spend a great deal of time reading articles on Grantland, Deadspin, and ESPN. As some of you may know, these sites have posted an article or two (sarcasm) regarding the Donald Sterling fiasco and what it means for basketball. Recorded telling his mistress not to bring black people to Clippers games and not to take photos with them, the business magnate and former attorney was on Tuesday banned from the NBA for life and fined $2.5 million. Soon he may be coerced into selling his team. From “despicable and prejudiced” (his wife’s words), to a “piece of human waste,” Sterling has deservedly taken on many labels in the past few days.
Sterling’s audio rant is not his first brush with racial insensitivity. In deposition for a discrimination lawsuit brought in 2003, one of his top employees testified that Sterling said that “all of the blacks in this building, they smell, they’re not clean” and “all of the Mexicans … just sit around and smoke and drink all day.” In 2006, the United States Department of Justice charged Sterling with housing discrimination, after he allegedly refused to rent his Los Angeles residential complexes to African- or Mexican-Americans. Both cases were settled without public admission of guilt.
Fast forward to 2009, when former Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor filed for a wrongful-termination lawsuit, claiming that Sterling discriminated against him due to his age and race. In court papers, Baylor, an 11-time All-Star and a Hall of Famer, claimed that Sterling confided in him his desire for a “white Southern coach coaching poor black players.” The report alleged that potential head coach candidates were turned down for racial reasons. Well, Doc Rivers, an African American head coach, just led the Clippers to their winningest regular season in franchise history. In his first season with the team. Imagine that.
ESPN’s Bomani Jones wrote an article in 2006 titled “Sterling’s Racism Should Be News.” But it wasn’t. More people read that column this week than when he wrote it nine years ago. Why? Journalist Howard Kurtz recently quipped that “lawsuits are dry,” while “secret tapes are hot.” True, but there’s more to the story than that.
Think back to 2006. If you wanted to pass along an interesting news story, what were you going to do? Mail a newspaper clipping to a friend? Build a fire and send smoke signals? Myspace it? All kidding aside, what may seem like minute technological advancements have actually contributed to a major shift in the dissemination of news.
Back to 2014, we all have smartphones. Okay, 65 percent of us do. Personally, mine alerted me approximately 4,050 times about the developing scandal, and that’s before I even placed my thumb on the fingerprint scanner. Whether I opened up Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or even 2048, I just could not escape this guy.
Social media allows for current events to transcend reality and assume an online metanarrative. Take CNN’s coverage of the tragic Malaysian Airlines Flight 370. I cannot begin to fathom the frenzy our world would be thrown into if historical tragedies like President Kennedy’s assassination or the Challenger explosion occurred in today’s day and age.
No longer are articles limited by the numbers of interviews conducted, as anyone can post their thoughts on Twitter. And they have.


No longer is the viewing of related visuals limited to subscribers to a certain source, as photographs and videos can go viral on social media. And they have.
But perhaps most importantly, social media allows each and every one of us a larger stake in the public discourse. That is the reason why this story blew up now rather than in 2006 or 2009. In 2006, the initial TMZ report could very well have remained just that: a TMZ report. But because hundreds of thousands of Twitter users became justifiably invested in this story, major news outlets and the National Basketball Association sprung to action. Because ultimately, the media is a business that caters to the curiosity of the public. And social media has provided this public a powerful mechanism in dictating the way events unfold around us.
Prior to the advent of Twitter or Facebook, civilian efforts to alter the status quo often relied on mass protests or boycotts that drew attention to the issue at hand. While honorable and often effective, these efforts were frequently plagued with the problem of “free riding.” But sending a tweet or sharing an article takes much less effort and is in turn more likely to reach a larger audience. Whether online protests are as effective as their predecessors is yet to be determined, but in this instance, the media latched on and Donald Sterling is banned for life.

Yesterday, I finished up my last problem set of junior year. After a quick nap and two or three short hours on Facebook, I realized just how much free time I have over course of the next week. I know, I know, finals are coming up, and I have four too many of those. And true, I have an essay to write in the meantime, comparing and contrasting Stalinism, surrealism, and Shintoism for my History of Philosophical Governance class. But I mean who really cares? The real issue is that I’m not yet 21 and all my friends seem to be hitting their midlife crises already. Talk about struggling through finals period.
 
Now don’t think for a moment that I am apathetic toward surrealism, sexism, or any other -ism. I believe that they are bad. Various -isms distort our ability to express our inner natures and think for ourselves as individuals. To quote Kanye West, “I embody every characteristic of the egotistic. He knows, he’s so fuckin’ gifted.” Excellent point there. That man is the self-proclaimed greatest of all time. I could be the self-proclaimed greatest of all time, but it doesn’t change the fact that I’m still only 20 and some bars actually check.
 
Despite my age, I am left with a wonderful week, before a desperate panic sets in about finals, in which I have all the time in the world to find something to do. 
 
I thought about making a trip over to the Institute of Politics for one of their forums. I might go, except I already went to the speech last time by the politician who lost an election in that foreign country a few years ago, and don’t really feel like doing the same thing all over again. I mean hell, I can’t even find Canada on a map, and that’s America’s hat. I’m certainly not going to know anything about a country that doesn’t even resemble an article of clothing.
 
I’m just kidding, guys. I love the Institute of Politics. They usually have free food.
 
Speaking of free food, Annenberg opens itself up to all classes during exam period and the week beforehand. This would be a fantastic thing to remember, if I were ever looking to walk for 20 minutes to eat a slightly worse version of my own house’s dining hall food.
 
Of course, there’s more to life than food. There’s Netflix, too. One of my friends suggested I start watching a show called “Drop Dead Diva.” “You have to get past the first episode!” she told me. “I promise it’s a really good show.” So, like any good friend would, I went on YouTube and watched a two minute clip before coming to the conclusion that maybe I need to find new friends. I wound up spending most of the evening watching the latest reruns of “Archer” before being reminded by my editor that I had a column to write for this newspaper.
 
I know what you’re thinking. I should stop fooling around, tell my editor to be fruitful and multiply with himself, and write my essay for class already! The one about spiritualism and stoicism, or something like that. Let me assure you that the assignment is not due until Tuesday, so I’ll be spending the better part of Monday night trying to extend sentences and reach the minimum word count.
 
But you’re absolutely right that writing an entire essay all about -isms is not the simplest task. Classes seem to get harder and harder with every passing year. Freshman year was about being able to find the intersection of two lines on a graph. Sophomore year had more complicated equations that involved both numbers and letters, and now I’m working on long-winded essays about topics I’ve never heard of, possibly because they were only discussed in lecture, or section, or the readings, or some combination of the three. By next year I’ll probably need to cure some obscure disease to meet my science requirement.
 
And things are just looking harder from here on out. Just wait until we have to earn our own livings, out in the wider world where we aren’t always provided with free Toastie-O cereal at the convenient hours of 9:15 to 10:45 p.m. So before we have to worry about real problems, like what the little blinking light on the dashboard means or how to figure out the neighbor’s Wi-Fi password, we should all take a moment, an afternoon, or maybe all of reading period to slow down and watch reruns of “Archer.” Or smell the roses, but let’s try not to be too ridiculously trite. As the great Ferris Bueller once mused, “Pardon my French, but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you’d have a diamond.” Don’t be Cameron, unless you want a diamond.
 
Take it with a grain of salt, though, because this was a guy who once licked his palms to play hooky in high school. I don’t know about you, but my parents would have told me to wash my hands instead.
 
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be busy trying to turn 21, one pint at a time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This Monday, the White House issued new guidelines for combatting sexual assault on college campuses. The guidelines were released by a task force that President Barack Obama convened this January after a string of high publicized rapes on college campuses. The recent guidelines are a much-needed update to Title IX, the portion of the Education Amendments passed in 1972 that holds universities accountable for ensuring a campus environment free of gender discrimination.
The new guidelines correctly focus on the role that both school and government administrators should play in addressing campus rape. While prosecution of attackers should remain a priority, we should not deny the important role universities can play in creating a culture of safety for its students. The study notes that, at the present time, many universities do a poor job of disseminating helpful information to survivors of sexual assault. Eastern Michigan University, for example, was fined for failing to inform its student body that a female student was sexually assaulted and killed.  This problem should be simple to fix, and the fact that it hasn’t been lends insult to injury.
We also commend the president’s task force for focusing on sharing best practices between colleges. Specifically, the guidelines have cited bystander awareness policies being implemented at the University of New Hampshire and University of Kentucky as examples to follow. The government also launched a website, NotAlone.gov, that seeks to educate college men and women about Title IX and the realities of sexual assault. Democratizing the access to information regarding students’ rights is an important step in the right direction.
The new guidelines also address the question of whether universities should be expected to punish rape that occurs on campus at all. Some critics may point to the fact that other heinous crimes, such as murder or battery, are dealt with through legal means. But it is important to note that the Title IX guidelines do not exclude this option. In fact they explicitly state that “a criminal investigation does not relieve a school of its independent obligation to conduct its own investigation—nor may a school wait for a criminal case to conclude to proceed.”
Certainly in an ideal world, allegations of sexual assault would be swiftly dealt with by the police. Women would not feel shame for coming forward as survivors. Unfortunately, it is clear that the current state of affairs is far from this ideal. The government’s study shows that roughly two percent of “incapacitated sexual assault survivors” (such as those who were under the influence of drugs or alcohol), and 13 percent of forcible rape survivors report their assault. It is true that in order to fully bring an end to rape, a massive societal shift must occur. But millennia of misogyny do not dissipate overnight, and in the meantime the government guidelines serve a necessary purpose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Faculty Council—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ top elected body—voted Wednesday to approve legislation creating the College’s first ever honor code, which includes an honor board to hear cases of alleged violations of academic integrity.
The legislation will likely go before the full Faculty for a vote next Tuesday, according to standard procedure of the body. If approved, the honor code would likely go into effect at the beginning of the 2015-2016 academic year.
“I think it is important that we make progress toward instituting the Honor Code and the Honor Board quickly, and therefore hope that it will be approved at our next Faculty Meeting,” History professor Alison Frank Johnson, a member of the Faculty Council, wrote in an email Thursday.
The faculty most recently reviewed a draft of the proposal at its monthly meeting in April. Most of the discussion surrounding the possible code at that meeting centered on the issue of how frequently students would be required to make an affirmation of integrity.
That question remains unanswered in the legislation approved by the Faculty Council, Johnson said. Instead, it delegates the decision to the dean of the College, a stipulation that was previously stated in the draft distributed to faculty members in April.
“I voted in favor of a proposal that left this open because I think it is wise to leave some discretion on this matter to the incoming dean,” Johnson wrote in an email. “I did not believe that resolving this [question] should delay the proposed introduction of an Honor Code and Honor Board.”
Incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana would have a year to decide on the frequency with which students would make the affirmation. His office would also be responsible for working out the honor board and its relationship with the Administrative Board, the College’s existing disciplinary body.
According to a draft of the code distributed before last month’s faculty meeting, the honor code would not include a requirement that students report instances of cheating that they observe. In addition, under the new policy, exams would continued to be proctored. Alleged violations of academic integrity would be heard by an honor board partly made up of student members, separate from the Ad Board.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This is the part II of a two-part series on Harvard's proposed student honor code. Part I ran on April 30. 
Supporters of the proposal for the College’s first-ever honor code have not been shy about their ambitions for the policy.


Members of the Academic Integrity Committee—the group of faculty members, students, and administrators who developed the proposal—have repeatedly said that they hope that the honor code, if adopted, will change Harvard’s academic culture. Much of the conversation about the honor code has centered on campus attitudes toward academic integrity. The motivation for the policy, as described in a mid-January draft, is “strengthening a culture of academic integrity” at the College.
Supporters of the proposal emphasize that inspiring student and faculty “buy-in” to the policy is necessary to create this shift in culture. They suggest that adding student voice to the disciplinary process and prompting more conversation about academic integrity issues will be key to gaining student support.
With the Faculty Council’s approval on Wednesday and a vote expected among the broader Faculty of Arts and Sciences next week, it seems more likely than ever that the proposal—one that would establish a student-faculty judicial board to hear cases of academic dishonesty and a requirement for students to sign a statement affirming their commitment to the code—will become policy.
But even if the proposal passes, the honor code will face challenges beyond faculty members critical of its contents. In their ambitious effort to change the culture of a 377-year-old institution, those charged with implementing the honor code may also encounter hurdles created by a restructured disciplinary system and a community that may be apathetic to the policy’s purpose.
IMPLEMENTING HONOR
If the Faculty approves the proposal next week, College administrators and others will be tasked with implementing the honor code, and with that will come its own challenges, some of them purely logistical.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who chairs the Academic Integrity Committee, has previously said that he expects the honor code to be implemented by the fall of 2015, leaving College administrators just over a year to put into place the mechanisms and infrastructure necessary for its operation.
That implementation process will come in tandem with a period of transition for the College and its disciplinary system. The Administrative Board, which would still hear academic dishonesty cases next academic year even if the policy is approved, will experience a change in leadership as incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana chairs the body for the first time. The board will also have to adjust to the departures of longtime secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison and Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell this summer.
As the administration fills existing positions within its disciplinary system, if the honor code proposal becomes policy, the College will also be tasked with filling newly-created roles with students, administrators, and faculty. College leaders will be navigating a new disciplinary system that will involve students in the process of adjudicating cases of alleged academic dishonesty for the first time.
Although a mid-January draft of the honor code offers only limited information on plans for the student-faculty board it proposes, the draft stipulates that the body’s membership be composed of half students and half faculty and administrators.
Michael C. Ranen, the resident dean for Ivy Yard and a member of the Academic Integrity Committee, called selecting students for the board and training them properly a “major challenge.” Ranen said that making the student members “understand that they’re not just token members” of the honor board will be necessary for it to be successful.
Peter F. Lake '81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said that student members of judicial boards need to be trained extensively, something that could present a challenge during implementation.
“One of the big problems is just trying to manage the training and consistency issues,” Lake said, adding that student members could bring with them possible conflicts of interest and bias and risk being retaliated against after convicting a peer. Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 added that he worries that student members of the board would be “harsher” than administrators.
Even after student members of the board are trained, the honor code’s adoption might spur another logistical challenge, according to outside experts, in the form of an increased academic dishonesty caseload.
Gary Pavela, a former director of academic integrity at Syracuse University who has consulted other colleges on integrity issues, said that Harvard should have the administrative infrastructure in place to handle a “sharp increase” in the number of reported academic integrity infractions after the honor code becomes policy. When he worked at the University of Maryland during the adoption of its honor code, Pavela said the number of reported cases increased as faculty reported at a higher rate.
Similarly, Ellison said that he expects the College to see a spike in reported infractions after the honor code’s adoption because the policy will increase faculty focus on integrity issues. Harris wrote in an email that it “seems hazardous to offer any guess” as to the possibility of an increase.
AN APATHETIC SHIFT
Implementers of the proposed honor code may face a broader obstacle than facilitating a change in the College’s disciplinary system. Not only will they have to convince some apathetic faculty members and students that an honor code is necessary for the community, but also that their enthusiasm is essential to the policy’s success.
Supporters of the honor code have emphasized that community buy-in will be key to successfully creating a culture shift at the College and increasing student and faculty focus on the integrity issues emphasized in the policy. Those involved in shaping the honor code have suggested that starting more formalized conversations about academic integrity throughout undergraduates’ four years at Harvard would help spur that support among students.
Terah E. Lyons ’14, a student member of the Academic Integrity Committee who was one of several members to draft the proposal, said that faculty members and others who have criticisms of the policy “certainly have legitimacy in voicing it.” Still, she added, “in implementing something like this, optimism really is the key to success.”
If initial reaction to the proposed honor code is any indication, the Academic Integrity Committee may find itself hard-pressed to inculcate a high level of enthusiasm around the honor code.
Undergraduate attendance at the four feedback sessions on a draft of the honor code held at the beginning of the semester was low. The largest of the four meetings, held in Kirkland House, drew less attendance from students than the number of individuals who sit on the Academic Integrity Committee, while only two students not involved in the committee attended a session held in Cabot House.
Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who attended a high school with an honor code, said a minority of students are “very passionate” about the honor code proposal, either for or against it.
“I think the majority of students don’t really care about it,” Mayopoulos said. “I think even when the honor code is enacted, which I hope it will be, I think still the majority of students won’t care about it.” He maintained that students’ indifference is for the best because it indicates that most are not cheating and therefore are less affected by the regulations.
Students are not the only members of the community apathetic towards the possibility of the College’s first honor code, as faculty discussion of the proposal has been limited in both public and private conversations. At multiple faculty meetings this semester when the proposal was under discussion, Harris fielded only a handful of questions on the code.
According to government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, although faculty care deeply about academic integrity, the specific proposal is “nothing to write home about.”
“It’s a response to an emergency, or what the administration saw as an emergency,” said Mansfield, referring to the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest in recent memory. “I think that’s generally understood and generally appreciated, but not enthused over. We had to do something and this is what we’ve done.”
While Harris has denied that the Academic Integrity Committee’s work was a response to any one case, the cheating scandal accelerated the group’s efforts.
Lyons, for her part, said that she thinks there is a “large contingent” of faculty members enthusiastic about the honor code, among them members of the Academic Integrity Committee who helped create it.
“I think once people come to understand it in a deeper sense, people will sort of adopt that enthusiasm,” Lyons said.
Still, Lewis said he thinks that some faculty members are not engaged because the proposal, as it stands, has limited effect on how professors teach their classes.
“I’m not terribly surprised it hasn’t caused a lot of conversation in the faculty. And it’s not because Harvard’s faculty doesn’t care about undergraduate affairs; they do when it really impacts the way students engage with education and research,” said Lewis, also a computer science professor. “It’s just not clear that this does that in the same way.”

Eric E. Schmidt, current executive chairman and former chief executive officer of Google, discussed topics surrounding entrepreneurship and technological innovation during an address at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Thursday evening.


During his talk, entitled “Innovation and Leadership in the New Digital Age,” Schmidt laid out the attributes of effective and ineffective entrepreneurs.
“The successful entrepreneur doubles down, fights harder, leads harder, challenges harder, and eventually wins. The unsuccessful entrepreneur gets scared, gets timid, loses confidence, falls apart,” Schmidt said. “That’s the difference between a billion dollars and zero.”
The forum’s moderator David R. Gergen, current director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School of Government and professor of public service, asked Schmidt if joblessness was the “dark side” to innovation.
“I’m personally very worried about [joblessness],” Schmidt said, explaining that automation in the technology industry has reduced the need for many traditional workers’ skills.
In light of this increasing automation, Schmidt said that the U.S. public education system must be reformed to better teach students the analytical skills they need to compete in the modern job market.
”So, we don’t educate the kinds of people we needed 50 years ago, we educate the kinds of people we need in the next 50 years,” Schmidt said.
In an interview after the forum, Gergen agreed with Schmidt on the importance of educating students to meet new demands.
“Clearly one of the questions that this university is grappling at is how do we do a better job of preparing our students for this new age, so they understand the underlying principles and can think ahead of the curve,” Gergen said.
Gergen also praised Schmidt, calling him “one of the most insightful people on the planet about the new digital age.”
Schmidt closed his address by explaining how the effects of technological innovation may alter society today.
In a question and answer session with the audience after his address, Schmidt said he was optimistic about the expansion of Google Fiber, the company’s recently-launched broadband internet service. He also commended methods of innovation in other countries like Israel, and warned of the permanence of information on the internet.

The Undergraduate Council honored exceptional faculty members and students with various awards for teaching and advising at its annual awards ceremony Thursday evening.
The event allowed students to celebrate professors, advisors, and peer advising fellows who have shown support both inside and outside the classroom. During the ceremony, each award recipient and one of their nominators gave a short speech. 
UC representatives read through about 200 nominations and ultimately chose three recipients for the Joseph R. Levenson Memorial Teaching Award, three recipients for the John R. Marquand Award for Exceptional Advising and Counseling of Harvard Students, and one recipient for the Thomas Dingman Award for Freshman Advising.
“The process was very, very difficult because all the nominators had wonderful stories,” UC Education Committee Chair Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 said. “We stayed up until one in the morning discussing all of the stories, factoring in the number of nominations they received.”
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 received the first Freshman Advising award, which was subsequently renamed in his honor, at the ceremony in 2012. This year, the award was given to James P. Biblarz ’14, a PAF for freshmen in Lionel Hall.
“A characteristic of a good advisor is constancy,” said Mira S. Hayward ’17, who nominated Biblarz. “No matter the seriousness of the issue, he’s always there to help.”
Goyal said he believes the large number of nominations is indicative of how supportive the advising staff is at Harvard.
“It’s very hard for them to make their selection given how many remarkable students and faculty members have made this campus effective in advising and teaching, and it’s important to honor those people that do it very well,” Dingman said.
The Levenson award went to one senior faculty member, one junior faculty member, and one teaching fellow. This year, the teaching fellow prize went to an undergraduate student, Felipe A.S. Da Cruz ’15, who assisted in teaching an engineering course.
Da Cruz said he was influenced by his own experience as a student in the course.
“My TF and other teaching staff were incredible,” Da Cruz said. “They all stayed with us all night and really made sure every student understood what was going on.”
As the undergraduate population at the School of Engineering and Applied Science has grown, Da Cruz said he wants to be able to provide the same experience for current students, adding that he does not think of his teaching as work. Many other award recipients shared similar sentiments.
According to their nominators, the award recipients shared traits such as the ability to foster a community, demonstration of willingness to help, and availability to students.

It might be time to take a closer glance at the nearest landline phone cord. Harvard researchers recently discovered a new shape—the hemihelix—which can be found in helical-like structures such as phone cords or slinkies. Shapes like the hemihelix might shed light on the process of creating three dimensional shapes from two dimensional starting materials, researchers said.
A team of five researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences discovered the shape while studying how flexible helical springs were formed. The hemihelix, they said, is special form of helix that frequently reverses the direction in which it spirals. 
“At first we were very surprised,” said Katia Bertoldi, a SEAS associate professor in applied mathematics who contributed to the discovery of the hemihelix. “This surprise motivated us to understand the reasons for such a shape to appear.” 
For Bertoldi, the most exciting part of the hemihelix discovery is that it represents a step towards a greater understanding of how strained flat systems can make complex 3D shapes.
 
“In our daily lives, we observe many intricate and well controlled patterns in natural, slender structures, such as flowers or leaves,” Bertoldi said. “These are often the result of specific mechanical instabilities, but our understanding of how in-plane stresses generated by non-uniform growth lead to 3D complex shapes is incomplete.”
Although the synthesis of of three dimensional shapes like the hemihelix in the laboratory is currently limited, Bertoldi added that she hopes the mechanisms of hemihelix formation can help create “simple strategies to engineer flat systems that shape themselves into desired 3D configurations.”
Looking towards the future, the hemihelix researchers said they hope to compare helices and hemihelices in terms of their mechanical properties, and in particular, how they respond to light.
The team, which included a SEAS graduate student, two SEAS post-doctoral students, and two SEAS professors, continued studying the hemihelix shape and published their findings in the journal PLOS ONE on April 23.

Acclaimed author Margaret E. Atwood was honored with the 2014 Harvard Arts Medal in a ceremony Thursday to mark the beginning of the 22nd Annual Arts First Festival.
Atwood received a master’s degree from Radcliffe College in 1962 as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. She is well known for her books of fiction and poetry as well as her critical essays on issues from the destruction of the environment to the role of women in society. Her notable works include the books The Blind Assassin and The Handmaid’s Tale, the latter of which is set in a dystopian Cambridge.
In an interview with The Crimson last year, Atwood described her experiences as a graduate student in a time when women were not allowed in Lamont Library.
“It meant that I spent a lot of time in the Widener stacks, where somebody had made a little collection of Canadian Literature which was right next to the Witchcraft and Demonology—so two of my interests were just right there, side by side,” she said.
The Harvard Arts Medal was established in 1995, making Atwood its 21st recipient. The award seeks to honor alumni or faculty of the University that have made a special contribution to the arts. Past recipients include Matt Damon ’92, Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and, Tommy Lee Jones ’69.
When asked what advice she had for aspiring writers at Harvard in an interview with the Harvard Arts Blog, Atwood stressed the difficulties associated with pursuing a writing career.
“Don’t do it unless you really have to, and are very determined, and can deal with disapproving relatives, and are prepared to accept the roles that luck and chance play in such things,” she said. “There’s no boss, but there’s also no pension plan.”
Thursday’s awards ceremony kicked off the 2014 Arts First Festival. The annual festival is a showcase of artistic talent from faculty members and students all across the University produced by the Office for the Arts. The festival will last from Thursday to Sunday and  provides a wide variety of events accessible to the local public, including several free performances.
Some of the notable events at this year’s Arts First Festival include the Party on the Plaza on Friday which features several student and alumni bands such as the Cantab Cowboys and The Love Experiment. Other attractions include a Japanese Tea Ceremony sponsored by the East Asian Languages Department, the 19th Annual Harvard Pow Wow, and a performance by Grammy award nominee and Harvard professor Vijay Iyer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: May 2, 2014, at 7:11p.m.
The day after one of its undergraduate members was arrested during a protest in front of Massachusetts Hall, the environmental activist group Divest Harvard held another rally in front of the home of the University’s central administration and continued to demand an open meeting with its top leadership.
Since its founding in 2012, Divest Harvard has urged the University to unload its holdings in fossil fuel companies and demanded an open audience with University President Drew G. Faust and the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Though Faust and members of the Corporation have met with members of Divest Harvard, the organization has criticized the meetings for taking place behind closed doors and for not leading to discernible progress.
At Friday’s rally, which was attended by a crowd which swelled to nearly 75, members of Divest Harvard continued to clamor for an open meeting with University leadership, but much of the event focused on the University’s response to protesters the previous day.
Among the first to speak was Brett A. Roche ’15, the student who was arrested by Harvard University Police Thursday morning and quickly released after all charges against him were dropped. As Roche recounted the story of his arrest, murmurs in the crowd ceased and gave way to a loud applause. Roche said that the adversity has been formative for the group.
“This has been an experience of incredible growth for many members of Divest,” Roche said. Afterwards, he added that he thought that his arrest, and the group’s organized protests this week, would together “draw a lot of attention to the administration on this issue.”
After Roche, a host of students, faculty members, and others—some not affiliated with Harvard—took the microphone. Frederick E. Small, a graduate of Harvard Divinity School and a Unitarian minister based in Cambridge, said that in his mind the Divest movement is about justice.
“I don’t think Harvard is scared of Brett [Roche] physically,” Small said. “I think Harvard is scared about Brett morally.”
Tim M. DeChristopher, a student at the Divinity School who has been involved with environmental responsibility protests across the country, attacked University leadership for its treatment of protestors the day before, and for not agreeing to an open meeting with the community on the issue of divestment.
“Yesterday was one of those moments when Harvard’s values were on display, and as the leader of this institution, the public face of this institution, Drew Faust’s values were on display as well,” DeChristopher said. “What we saw was pretty disappointing. We saw this University respond to a request for open dialogue with repression and with bullying, and it needs to be known that that kind of action is unacceptable for this institution.”
DeChristopher went on to accuse Faust and other top administrators of “[using] the police to do their dirty work because they weren’t willing to come out here and engage in a dialogue.”
Kevin Galvin, a University spokesperson, wrote in a statement on Thursday that “[Harvard] welcomes the exchange of ideas and respects the rights of individuals to air differing views. At the same time, we put a premium on respecting the rights of individuals to carry out their duties to the institution.”
The event concluded with representatives from Divest Harvard, along with Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, delivering a ceremonial box of petitions demanding an open meeting to the front door of Mass. Hall. The box—the real petitions are electronic and will be emailed to Faust—was accepted by Faust’s senior special assistant Lars P.K. Madsen, who said that he would deliver it to the president. Roche’s arrest on Thursday morning came after Madsen was unable to enter Mass. Hall due to the blockade.
Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, who sits on the board of Divest Harvard, said after the event that she feels the group is gaining momentum.
“We will be organizing around alumni reunions, we will be organizing over the summer,” she said. “We have big plans for the fall.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“You can’t outwork a bad diet.”
So reads the whiteboard in the weight room of the Palmer Dixon Strength and Conditioning Center, where men and women from across Harvard’s 42 varsity sports come to lift, train, and prepare for the grind of their seasons.
But perhaps these athletes don’t need the added reminder that this sign provides.
For athletes, eating habits don’t just regulate their choices in the dining halls. They also affect their lives on the river and on the field, in classrooms and in dorm rooms. Whether it is bulking up for training camp or slimming down for a weigh-in, for many Harvard athletes, diet remains a constant in the forefront of their minds, impacting their academic, social, and athletic experiences at Harvard.
Much has been made in the media about abnormal eating habits and disorders in young adults. But what happens when those exceptions become the norm? When the proscribed behavior on a team urges athletes to focus more on immediate results—a rower’s eligibility to race on Saturday—than possible long-term health ramifications?
Work done by sports scientist Marriane Martinsen and sports medicine professor Jorunn Sundgot-Borgen indicates that, for some athletes, the answer to that question is simple: to achieve peak performance level, they must subscribe to the demands—and diet—of their sport. In their 2013 study, the researchers found that young elite athletes (50.7 percent) were twice as likely than non-athletes of the same age (25 percent) to be considered “at risk” for an eating disorder.
This emphasis on the “correct” body type for an athlete has created a culture in which athletic feats and disordered eating go hand in hand, experts and Harvard athletes say—a phenomenon only intensified at schools like Harvard by the pressure to adhere to team expectations.
“WHAT DOES ‘FIT’ MEAN?”
If the white noise of the media wasn’t enough to portray the need to have a certain body to college athletes, the motivation to perform at a high level only fuels the flame.
Kate, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson due to the sensitivity of the topic, was a walk-on to the Harvard women’s track and field team; she eventually walked off, but not before witnessing widespread patterns of “disordered eating.”
“[Runners] have the media, whoever, saying be skinny,” Kate said. “And they know…mathematically speaking, if I’m skinnier I can go faster. But you also have to remember you need to consume those calories to be able to make your body go faster. It’s such a very, very delicate balance between eating enough so you have enough energy, and then being skinny enough for society.”
For Emily Kroshus, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Social and Behavioral Science at the Harvard School of Public Health and a former All-American distance runner at Princeton, these pressures create a standard that athletes feel compelled to meet.
“I think ‘looking fit’ is a term that is used by coaches quite a bit, usually with reference to someone looking thin,” Kroshus said. “But are you looking fit? No, you’re looking thin…. I think in many cases, team members want to please [their coaches], want to do well, want to move up in the roster spots, and I think often times they are looking for cues from their coach for what’s good.”
This influence of team dietary practices—established by coaches or upperclassmen—is one factor that can lead athletes to fixate on their weights. According to a 2002 study by University of Utah clinical professor Katherine Beals, 55 percent of female student-athletes reported “experiencing pressure to achieve or maintain a certain weight” from both internal (the self) and external (teammates and coaches) sources.
This pressure, said Kroshus, can often lead to serious consequences. The National Eating Disorder Association characterizes an eating disorder as a mental illness, one that “include[s] extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors surrounding weight and food issues.” While the common perception may be that those with eating disorders necessarily also have anxiety over their body images, the two are not mutually inclusive, experts say. As The American Psychiatric Association has stated, individuals can meet the criteria for an eating disorder if they exhibit “persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain,” whether or not this is directly related to self-image.
Those suffering from eating disorders are likely to have impaired physical, emotive, and cognitive functions. In fact, work done by University of North Carolina professor Patrick Sullivan indicates that eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.
While eating disorders are certainly present throughout the athletics, “disordered eating” is both more common on individual teams and more pervasive across teams. According to clinical psychologist Carrie Gottlieb, the difference between an eating disorder and disordered eating is a matter of gradation. An athlete suffering from the latter is “engaged in some of the same behavior as those with eating disorders, but at a lesser frequency or lower level of severity.” Due to the similarity between the conditions, those with disordered eating may “be at risk for developing” the more acute eating disorder.
Since witnessing such disordered eating firsthand at Princeton, Kroshus has investigated the impact of teams in promoting healthy behaviors.
In a qualitative study of two analogous cross country programs, Kroshus found that runners were significantly more likely to respond to and report a team member’s potentially problematic eating habits when nutrition had been an open topic of discussion amongst the group throughout the season, rather than when dietary habits were largely kept to one’s self. Kroshus attributes much of this effect to the former situation’s positive eating culture created through emphases on constant communication from both coaches and captains.
“People may be internalizing [supposed team norms], or there may be explicit pressure from teammates,” said Bryn Austin, the director of Harvard’s Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders. “[Coaches] need to take a lot more responsibility for these types of things, [as] their expectations, whether they’re implied or explicit, can lead players to take desperate measures to try to control their weight.”
“IT’S A SHARED BURDEN”
For sports such as lightweight crew in which weight dictates whether or not one can compete in a given race, this pressure to control one’s eating habits becomes an obligation.
Consequently, for the men and women lightweight rowers, Friday afternoons mean one thing: weigh-in.
At 3 p.m., the women lightweight rowers take their turns climbing onto the scale at the boathouse, flitting their eyes across the screen to make sure their weight is less than 130 pounds. Just hours later, their male counterparts go through the same motions, hoping to make the 160-pound cut-off.
According to members of both teams, many rowers’ natural body weights are higher than the team-specific maxima, creating a situation in which the athletes must be continually aware of their caloric intake from the first day of the season—a cognizance that is amplified in the week before a race.
“I think a successful weigh-in is when you don’t need to starve yourself the day of,” said junior lightweight rower Tiffany M. Fonseca.
For senior lightweight rower Cameron J. Heron, “regimentation” would be the word to describe the seven days leading up to a weigh-in. Heron explained that on the Monday before a race, desserts, juices, and unnecessary calories will be eliminated from his diet, his focus on consuming proteins and vegetables. By Thursday, he restricts his diet to light foods, and on Friday, he says that rowers tend to “just eat what sustains [them] throughout the day,” as “whatever weight you put into your body [at that point] is going to be with you on weigh-ins.”
By the time of the Friday weigh-in, Heron said that he will have generally cut six to seven pounds off of his early-week weight.
The immediate necessity to weigh in at the right number largely results from the sense obligation rowers feel to their teammates.
“[There’s] a desire not to let your team down,” Fonseca said. “[Preparing for weigh-ins] is something you have to do because obviously you don’t want to be the only person to not make weigh-in, and then you let your whole boat down…. Sometimes it’s stressful if you have a lot of weight to lose, but I don’t think it’s something we’re afraid [to do].”
For men’s lightweight crew, the need to ‘average’—each boat must average 155 pounds a man—only places more emphasis on the unity of each eight-man boat, transforming weigh-ins into a collective effort.
Heron said that each boat member weighs himself daily, deciding upon a goal weight that he feels capable of hitting. This process enables some rowers to exceed the 155 mark, while letting others who are naturally smaller remain below.
“It’s a give and take just depending on how everyone is doing every week,” Heron said. “You end up being very conscious of where your body is. So in the process of losing weight it’s not like a couple big guys have to lose a ton and the small guys don’t need to do anything, we all help each other out.”
“It ends up that everyone’s losing about the same proportional amount of weight, so it’s a shared burden,” he added.
Neither of the lightweight coaches could be reached for comment.
While it might take place on the mats instead of on the river, wrestling, too, requires its participants to have a weigh-in prior to competition.
Sophomore Nick J. Stager, who wrestled in the 149-pound weight class this past season, spent last summer bulking up through both weightlifting and eating, trying to get as big as possible. The end result was that he approached the 170-pound mark in August, with the expectation that in September he would shed the added-weight and make the 149-pound weight class.
“My idea was to get as big as possible first, because it’s really hard to put on muscle when you’re starving yourself or when you’re close to starving yourself,” Stager said. “You have to expand before you can contract.”
In the week prior to a weigh-in, Stager would walk around anywhere from 155 to 159 pounds, needing to lose up to ten pounds in the days preceding the competition. For the final 24 hours before a meet, Stager would limit both his liquid and nutrient intake, eating only a sandwich for lunch that day if he considered his weight “good.” His dinner that night would be contingent on how he performed at practice in the afternoon.
On the morning of the competition, he would have just two pounds left to lose. After wearing added sweatpants and sweatshirts to induced increased perspiration during a morning-of practice, Stager would typically weigh in at 148.8, about 10 pounds less than his Monday mark.
“You never want to make the battle about making weight, because you want the battle to be the competition,” Stager said. “The competition isn’t making weight, but that’s a prerequisite.”
While cutting weight on a weekly basis might be the norm for his sport, Stager sees a wrestler’s choice of weight class as a potentially problematic situation—one in which too large of a weight drop could have related health complications.
 
“There are some people that may try to reach weight classes that aren’t optimal, that are unhealthy for them to wrestle at,” Stager said. “I have seen people, especially in high school, but even here, get injured…. When your body is depleted, when it doesn’t have the nutrition that it needs, injuries are more likely.”
“IT COULD BOTHER YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SO BIG”
Then there’s the other extreme: bulking up to fit your assigned role on a team in which strength determines potential.
That is the situation that many Harvard football players find themselves in when they first enter Palmer Dixon in August of their freshmen year. In those early weeks, Director of Strength and Conditioning James Frazier assesses the incoming players, telling the athletes whether they need to size up or slim down in order to fill their role on the squad.
While it may seem counterintuitive, junior tight end Tyler D. Hamblin describes the diet required for bulking up as more regimented than that followed when trying to lose weight.
“You’ve got to be detail-oriented, you’ve got to be disciplined,” said Hamblin, who had to gain a significant amount of weight in order to change his body type from that of a quarterback to that of a tight end after his freshman season. “It’s a lot easier I would say to lose weight than it is to gain weight.”
While size may be key to the sport, it can also play a less welcome role off the gridiron.
“Self-esteem and body image are things that people [in general at] our age grapple with all the time,” Hamblin said. “[When people] see football players, they stick out like a sore thumb. When we’re not wearing our red jackets, you just know us by our stature.”
“And we’re at Harvard—smart people tend to be slimmer, fitter,” he added. “Being an athlete, especially a football player, it could bother you that you have to be big—you’re bigger than everyone else…. So I could definitely see how that would weigh on a student athlete in any sport.”
For these players, though, “getting big” always comes back to sizing up in the right way. According to Hamblin, transitioning from high school to collegiate play forces athletes to be increasingly “conscious” of their bodies, placing an additional “stressor” on the players.
No longer can the athletes solely rely on their instincts or athletic ability as they did in high school, but now they have to be wary of the foods they consume as well.
“An athlete’s diet is transparent by the way they play on the field or court,” Hamblin said. “You can always tell which one of the players is eating well compared to which one of the players went out at 11:30 at night to the Hong Kong…[and I think this need to be ‘conscious’] bothers a lot of guys when they’re starting off.”
“I WAS NOT GOING TO STOP AT MUCH TO GET OUT THERE”
Former lightweight rower Erin F. Flynn ’13 knew that there was an issue. In the days leading up to a weigh-in, she was performing poorly on the river and in the classroom, feeling both a mental and physical strain. After walking on to the team her freshman year, she decided to walk off after her sophomore season.
While athletes often recognize the link between poor nourishment and injury, few take the time to reassess and prioritize their health. But when Flynn did that following her second year on the team, she decided to walk off crew and walk straight onto ECHO, Harvard’s peer counseling group that specializes in body image and eating concerns.
“Seeing the practices and being part of the practices of really trying to maintain a low weight, and dealing with the stress of it both mentally and physically was tough,” Flynn said. “I found that when we were going to have weigh-ins, I didn’t really want to get out of bed, and was just waiting for that moment when I could eat a bagel.”
While there has since been a coaching change on the women’s lightweight crew team, Flynn stated that the culture on the team just three years ago was one in which it was “taboo” to discuss weight-related issues.
“I don’t really know whether it was an actual lack of awareness on the coach’s part that this was happening or if it was a tacit understanding that it wasn’t in the coach’s purview,” Flynn said. “I would never accuse any of the coaches of knowing and perpetuating this...but I think it was a tough topic to broach.”
While it may not have been in the team management’s purview, it is a recognized concern for the Crimson athletic department, said Harvard University Health Services Sports Dietitian Meg S. Schrier.
“Our first priority is always the health and wellbeing of every student,” wrote Schrier in an email to The Crimson. “We work directly and regularly with student athletes to ensure that they are receiving the nutrition education they need to stay healthy, in and out of their sport. As part of this work, we would immediately respond to the needs of any student athlete who demonstrates signs of nutritional deficiencies or disordered eating.”
However, in Flynn’s experience, taboos remained loud and clear within the team, largely silencing conversations on potentially harmful eating habits. What developed in its place was an undercurrent of unhealthy weight-cutting strategies, including completing additional workouts, skipping meals, and chewing gum to induce incremental weight loss prior to weigh-ins.
“There was this ‘healthy way to lose weight’ that everyone wanted to follow, and of course if you could do that, then you did it,” Flynn said. “Then there was the reality of the situation where if you still had a few pounds to lose before the weigh-in, you had to...skip a couple of meals.”
More than once, Flynn saw a situation go too far: what had begun as cutting weight for a sport, turned into a more prolonged, out-of-season eating disorder.
Similarly, in long-distance running, the perception that trimming one’s weight would trim one’s competition time has led some athletes to restrict their diets in ways insidious to both their health and their performances.
“For some people, there is an idea that being thinner is being faster,” said Daniella, a former long distance runner who was granted anonymity by The Crimson due to the sensitivity of the topic. “And to an extent, that’s true, but only for a limited amount of time, and only for some people. [A] lot of the people that do take the more dangerous path toward becoming thinner in order to go faster end up getting injured. It’s a pattern [and] it’s just not something sustainable.”
But while an athlete’s problematic eating habits may have become self-apparent, a lack—or fear—of communication between the athlete and coach led to the former racing, whether he or she was physically and psychologically ready or not.
“I wanted to compete, and I was really not going to stop at much to get out there because the reason I did crew was that I loved to race,” Flynn said. “From the athletes’ side, [the question becomes] how do you admit to [eating concerns] when you’re scared you might be pulled out of the boat because [the coaches] realize that you are nutrient deficient?”
 
According to Kate, this need to compete—and compete at the highest level—can drive runners to fixate on their nutritional choices as the one training area entirely under their control.
“You can control your muscle mass to some extent, you can control your training to some extent, but you can really control your eating,” Kate said. “If you want to eat less, and if you have the willpower, you just eat less.”
However, it’s not always easy to differentiate between what is needed to excel at a sport and what can be considered disordered eating. For some, the boundary between the two is blurred and always changing.
“For the distance girls, is this a disorder? Is this just what you need for athleticism? Are the two mutually exclusive?” Kate asked. “It’s hard to draw the line for any psychological disorder, but it’s especially hard with eating disorders with athletes, who are perfectionists, who are under a ton of pressure from the athletics and the academics—is that an excuse for not eating? Is that an excuse for being too skinny? I don’t know. I wish it were that simple.”
“GOODNESS, I NEED TO DO THAT AS WELL”
For many, this preoccupation with diet is perpetuated by two concerns: wanting to perform well for the team and wanting to be aligned with the team.
However, athletes are aware that their sports require a precise balance between dietary restriction and nutritional needs. Too much weight shed or too restrictive of a diet would produce the opposite effect of what was desired, debilitating their performances completely.
“[The coaches] don’t want any of their athletes to be starving themselves because then they won't be effective rowers,” Heron said. “We’re not going to win races with someone who doesn’t have the energy to even practice.”
For one individual, however, this effort to strike a supposed sweet spot only exacerbated the existing issues in her sport’s nutritional habits.
“I think it was always the generic, ‘eat healthy or else hard work goes to waste.’ Eat healthy or all these hundreds of hours will be for nothing—I guess you could call it a fear tactic,” Kate said.
Kate stated that this “or else” mentality convinced her to look to her older teammates for advice in how to avoid “wast[ing]” her training
“I think [seeing how the older girls acted] definitely made me think twice before I would open a bag of chips, as opposed to a banana or something,” Kate said. “You just look up to these girls. They’re phenomenal athletes...and if they’re eating an orange and going on to win the Ivy League Championships, goodness, I need to do that as well.”
However, perhaps due to the importance of endurance in long-distance running, eating concerns continue to affect a majority of cross country teams.
“I would say it’s very rare for a distance runner in college not [to be] somewhere on the spectrum of disordered eating,” Kroshus said.  “[On my team at Princeton, there was a] disordered preoccupation with food that I think we thought at the time was very normal, but looking back now was clearly problematic…. [I feel] that our eating behaviors were really tied into feeling like there was something wrong with us."
“I think we had a pretty normal culture for the sport—some shining stars, some people who had real issues, but most people somewhere in the middle trying to figure it out for themselves,” she added.
“MAK[ING] NUTRITION A NORMATIVE CONVERSATION”
While disordered eating affects athletes on a day-to-day level, so too does it have consequences for the months and years that follow.
The long term effects are myriad. Eating disorders and disordered eating can result in anomalous heart rate patterns, pregnancy complications, kidney failures, and earlier age of death. According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, nearly half of those with eating disorders fit the clinical criteria for depression.
But on the track or on the river, often the only statistic in an athlete’s mind is that of a personal record or a team-best. This emphasis on the now rather than the later is what many believe perpetuates disordered eating.
If practices aren’t changed and this fixation on weight remains a part of athletes’ collegiate experiences, the research demonstrates that their nutritional restrictions and disordered eating will endure even after they cross the final finish lines.
“Those patterns are going to continue after college,” Austin said. “They’re not going to stop after track season is over or after they stop competing in whatever sport. Those patterns are set, for most people, until they get treatment.”
Kroshus’ work indicates that it is within the abilities of coaching staffs and team leaderships to change how athletes think about food.
“[Coaches need to] make nutrition a normative conversation,” Kroshus explained. “They shouldn’t dance around the issue of nutrition and let the team interpret it…. I think there isn’t enough conversation about how teams can play a really positive role—because they can.”
While the possibilities for improving team cultures are becoming apparent, the first step to alleviating some of this disorderly behavior is for athletes to recognize that the norms set forth by their sports are anything by normal.
“For me, I never questioned it or was surprised by it because I was living it,” Flynn said. “When you’re in it, it’s really hard to see anything else because you are living it yourself, you’re living it with the team, and you’re living it with the whole culture that you’re ingrained in. It can be really hard to break out of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A baseball player injured in last year’s bombings who returned to raise money for the Gillian Reny Stepping Strong Fund. A men’s lightweight crew coach who ran all 26.2 miles while undergoing chemotherapy. An 18-year-old sailor who was the youngest runner in the field. An assistant hockey coach who was given a bib to raise money for Parkinson’s disease. An assistant baseball coach who finished with a qualifying time and made his team’s Beanpot game against UMass immediately after. This handful of Harvard athletes and coaches all had one thing in common: they left their primary sports on Monday to participate in the 2014 Boston Marathon.
Kyle Larrow, second baseman on the baseball team, stood near the finish line last year watching his girlfriend, Danielle Reny, finish the marathon. When one of the bombs went off 10 feet from where they were standing, Larrow suffered severe burns and had shrapnel lodged in his legs. Danielle’s sister, Gillian Reny, suffered much more serious injuries, but her mangled legs were ultimately saved by doctors at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
This year, Larrow and Gillian’s family and doctors, teamed up to run in honor of the Stepping Strong fund, which the Reny family started to fund research for similar trauma type events that they experienced at last year’s marathon. The team ran together for the entire 26.2 miles and passed the bombing location and finish line holding hands.
“I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t incredibly emotional,” Larrow said. “I knew it was going to be a powerful moment before we ran and it exceeded expectations.”
Marathon running is out of Larrow’s element as a baseball player accustomed to running in 90 feet segments. Although Larrow trained up to 18 miles, he had to cut back for the six weeks before the marathon once his baseball season picked up.
“I’m definitely not a self-proclaimed distance runner,” Larrow said. “But I pretty much ran on the backs of the people cheering around me from mile 18 on.”
Linda Muri, men’s lightweight crew coach, was also lifted up by the crowd support and especially the cheering of her rowing team in the final mile. Despite receiving a breast cancer diagnosis six weeks ago and beginning chemotherapy just three weeks ago, Muri decided to follow through on the commitment she made to run last year.
Matthew Mollerus, a freshman skipper on the sailing team, earned his spot in the marathon by raising money for the American Medical Athletic Association through the Harvard College Marathon Challenge. Mollerus had to balance his training runs with sailing practices and races, especially in the weeks leading up to the marathon when the sailing team entered the heart of its season. At 18, Mollerus was the youngest entrant in the marathon this year.
Hayley Moore, assistant coach for the women’s hockey team, knew that after the events last year, she definitely wanted to run Boston this year. She also knew she wanted to run to raise money for Parkinson’s Disease, as both her aunt and grandfather are suffering from it. At first, she didn’t have a bib and she couldn’t find a charity associated with Parkinson’s.
Eventually, she found a family that receives a complimentary entry each year and wrote them a letter about why she wanted to run for Parkinson’s. They were generous enough to give her the bib. Her next challenge came with balancing training and coaching.
“Our [hockey] schedule isn’t very consistent as far as travel goes and with recruiting on top of that, so I could be doing my long run on a Sunday or Tuesday or Saturday,” Moore said. “I had to learn to be flexible and just hold myself accountable.”
For Moore, the highlight of the race came at mile marker 16 when she saw her aunt who she was running for and stopped to take pictures with her.
“It was the only time I stopped throughout the race,” Moore said. “I had to swallow my pride a little bit, but I stopped and took a moment to take it all in because she was the reason I was there.”
Morgan Brown, assistant coach for the baseball team, had previously qualified for the marathon. Brown’s finish time of 3:02:08 on Monday was not only enough to qualify him for next year, but also to allow him to make the baseball team’s Beanpot Championship against UMass that same afternoon. The Crimson went on to defeat the Minutemen and claim its first Beanpot Title since 2005.
