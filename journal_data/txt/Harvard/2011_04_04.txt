High in demand and short on time, it's becoming increasingly difficult for students to find their soul-mates. Fortunately,workaholic Ivy League students have a new service to help: IvyDate.
Harvard Business School alumni Beri Meric and Philipp B. Triebel have recently developed a new dating service, IvyDate.com, which connects singles, alumni, and current students, from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Columbia, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Cornell, Oxford, Cambridge, and London School of Economics, according to their website.
Francois de Lame, an employee of IvyDate, says that the service immerses members in a dating environment that, "connects amazing singles who value intelligence, creativity, and ambition."
However, before one can connect with other available singles, one has to apply and be approved as a member of IvyDate (Yes, it's as exclusive as the Ivy League).
Applying and receiving matches is free, and once one becomes a member, the website states that you can, "receive preferred access to exclusive events, dating experts, and high end dating related products and services." The website also lauds its exceptional privacy settings as a good tool for those who want to keep their love search low key.
Exclusivity and high standards, sounds like IvyDate knows its market.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Boston Ballet’s February press release, famed choreographer Jorma Elo said of his newest production, “I hope the audience comes to the theater with no expectations.” Indeed, convention was thrown aside from the very start in “Elo Experience” at the Boston Opera House last Friday night: dancer Jeffrey Cirio pushed an illuminated box on to the stage, knocked on its door to reveal the delicate Larissa Ponomarenko, and burst into a flurry of robotic movement before crying, “does she like sunshine?”
Elo, a longtime dancer of Netherlands Dance Theater, began his career as a choreographer with his old friend Mikko Nissinen, artistic director of Boston Ballet, by his side. Six years after Elo was appointed resident choreographer of the company, Nissinen decided to create a showcase of Elo’s work in Boston and around the world in an honorary production entitled “Elo Experience.”
The performance was split into 15 movements, eight of which were excerpts from Elo’s established repertoire. The remaining seven movements, woven in between Elo’s featured works, were set to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “Piano Concerto No. 1,” its score serving as a kind of soundtrack behind Ponomarenko and Cirio, the evening’s spunky narrators. Elo’s works in themselves were gems, but synthesizing them together into a cohesive night of ballet was an undeniably daunting task.
Elo chose Ponomarenko and Cirio for “Elo Experience” to “dramatiz[e] the discoveries he has experienced in his own artistic journey, to create a complete picture for the audience.” The duo’s flirtatious manner made them a lovable pair—perfect travelers through Elo’s choreographic world who not only danced, but also mimed and narrated throughout the performance. However, the voiced narration detracted from the beauty of their performance rather than guiding it. From their babbled call and response—when Ponomarenko says, “How fast was I going, officer?”, Cirio collapses to the floor and does the “worm”—to the cast’s comical rendition of Frank Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon,” Elo’s narrative element lacked the nuance and attention to detail that characterize his choreography and musical selections. On the contrary, it seemed out of context with the rest of the work and was sometimes a disservice to the dancers’ artistry. Often, the comical narration was laid over Tchaikovsky’s score in a way that seemed to mock the gravity of his composition.
The strongest work of the evening’s first half was “PLAN,” an excerpt from Elo’s 2004 work “Plan 2 B” previewed at the Harvard Dance Center this February. Lia Cirio, Jeffrey’s sister and the star of “PLAN,” distinguished herself among the company’s women with agility and femininity combined with thrilling athletic strength. Her dynamism was complemented by Isaac Akiba, whose lilting turns and flawless technique managed to shine even through Elo’s contemporary movement.
In a bold gesture of informality and accessibility, Elo directed Cirio and Ponomarenko to begin dancing on the stage during the intermission as the audience filtered into the hall—yet another way Elo led the audience through his choreographic world. The first of Elo’s excerpts that followed, a piece entitled “DOUBLE” that was set to the music of Philip Glass and Vladimir Martinov, opened an undeniably stronger second half. With bold red lights and a strong percussive rhythm, Elo’s choreography here was noticeably more balletic than modern, with split-second leaps and unforgiving leg extensions that revealed Boston Ballet’s classical virtuosity. Lorna Feijóo masterfully portrayed the affective qualities of Elo’s choreography by displaying an emotional intensity too often lost in the shock-and-awe athleticism used as a crutch by some of Elo’s contemporaries.
Elo’s “BLUE” continued in this more balletic vein, with the tutu-clad women transforming undulating modern movements into classical arabesque lines. Often, the work’s musicality and geometric formations seemed just a breath away from Balanchine’s neoclassicism. Throughout the evening, though particularly in “BLUE,” John Lam portrayed Elo’s style with a striking elasticity that did not forsake his articulation, but rather distinguished it among his fellow dancers.
The lighting design was as much a part of Elo’s artistic vision as his choreography. With Boston Ballet’s lighting designer John Cuff, Elo framed all three sides of the stage by hanging harshly lit rectangular panels that flashed from deep red to blue and even to white. However, Elo outdid himself in “LOST” when two metal beams, hung with stage lights and arranged in a cross, suddenly lowered from their usual posts high above the stage to hover mere feet over his dancers. The menacing, metallic structure of lights seemed almost predatory over the white-clad women, vaguely reminiscent of the white swans in Petipas’ classical masterpiece, “Swan Lake.” Dancing to the dream-like music of Bernard Herrmann, the Boston Ballet’s women evoked a delicate vulnerability that contrasted the looming lights and their forceful male counterparts. “LOST” presented Jorma’s vision at its best, and his lighting transformed his choreography from a spectacle into an experience.
The eye-popping lighting design, like the narrative element, the mime, and the unconventionally casual opening to the second act, was part of Elo’s congenial effort to portray a sense of connectedness as Boston Ballet’s dancers traced his choreographic journey: Elo worked to bring his audience along for the ride in every possible way. “Elo Experience” was a superlatively focused and exhaustive synthesis of contemporary work. Boston Ballet should be lauded for asking their audience not simply to admire the athleticism and beautiful physique of their dancers, but to push their perspectives in an altogether refreshing direction. And for that, I can stand some playful reinterpretation of Tchaikovsky’s “Piano Concerto No. 1.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There aren’t many ballet performances that incorporate aerial dance, snowfall, and a shopping cart into a single production, but the Harvard Dance Department knows no boundaries. Last Saturday in the New College Theatre, the Office for the Arts at Harvard held its final showing of “Dancers’ Viewpointe 11,” an eclectic and highly creative program that incorporated both professional and student choreography.
The show opened with an air of spontaneity: most of the dancers were positioned in the audience before the show, leaping through the rows of seats and skipping through aisles to reach the stage. A lighthearted improvisation followed, during which dancers moved to their own interpretation of a spoken word track composed of a succession of vignettes and anecdotes.
The highlight of the evening was the program’s second piece “RE +,” a multi-part collaboration between Keith A. Thompson—a professional dancer from the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange—and Harvard dancers who participated in the dance performance intensive during the January Optional Winter Activities Week. The first movement of “RE +” resembled a slowed-down martial arts routine, which expertly showcased the physicality and agility of male dancers Christian A. Rivera ’13 and Tabare A. Gowon ’11. “Red” was the theme of the next movement: bathed in red light, the dancers moved with and around red objects, including a giant red ball, a red book, and a red shopping cart, while one of the dancers repeated a short monologue into a red microphone. During the final movement, dozens of red microphones were lowered from the ceiling while the dancers performed from the floor, using only arms and legs to convey a searching motion. Capturing the eclectic nature of the show as a whole, “RE +” was a successful embodiment of the skillful collaborative effort between choreographer and dancers in the January intensive.
“Gamble Away,” choreographed only by students, featured the most experienced dancers in the program: Natalie A. Cameron '11, Whitney R. Fitts '12, Merritt A. Moore '10-'11, Kevin Shee ’11, and Elizabeth C. Walker '11. The piece was an elegant presentation of talent that was undoubtedly at a professional level. Though it was much more traditional than the other pieces—meticulous in form and technique, and free of props—“Gamble Away” was an admirable achievement for the dancers, as they succeeded in physically express their own vision onstage.
Exemplary technique and flawless execution characterized Brenda Divelbliss’ “Two and One,” the third piece of the show. Whitney R. Fitts ’12 and Kevin Shee ’11 completed one effortless lift after another in their impeccable performance. With sad, sweeping arm movements perfectly mirroring the grim piano melody, Fitts and Shee displayed both a beautiful chemistry and a technical prowess that established the stylistic versatility of Harvard’s performers.
With somber, church-like music set to solemn, heavy choreography, the appropriately titled “Elegy,” by Jessica Berson and the dancers was another outstanding work in the evening’s program. A tower of white silk was the only reprieve from a stage immersed in darkness. The aerial dancing from this white silk, set to a fascinating track of vocals, was certainly one of the most captivating moments of the production. Like “Re +,” “Elegy” was also the product of student-choreographer collaboration between Jessica Berson—Acting Dance Director of the Harvard Dance Department—and the dancers.
The show ended on a cheery, though perhaps overly simplistic note, with choreographer Peter Pucci’s dance of changing seasons, “sprangsprungspring.” Though a few exemplary solos raised the caliber of the piece, “sprangsprungspring” seemed elementary compared to the preceding works: it began with dancers bundled in winter coats under artificial snowfall on the stage and ended with dancers sweeping across the stage under bright lighting in beachwear. Though it ended on a somewhat of weak note, “Dancers’ Viewpointe 11” was, overall, a masterfully produced production that achieved its goal: to display the work of student collaboration that contributes to Harvard’s thriving college dance scene.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among Harvard students, Charlie Albright ’11 is a pre-med economics concentrator in Leverett House. However, as the Washington Post writes in their February review, Albright is “among the most gifted musicians of his generation.” On Albright’s website, Joe Biden is quoted as saying to him, “If I did my job as well as you do yours, I’d be President.” Now, Albright, the first classical pianist ever enrolled in the Harvard/New England Conservatory of Music (NEC) Five-Year B.A./M.M Joint Program, looks ahead as his last few months at college draw to a close in hopes of launching a full-time professional career.
The Harvard Crimson (THC): How did you enter the world of music?
Charlie Albright (CA): I was three and a half, so I only go by what I’ve been told that happened because I don’t remember. We had an upright piano in our house because [of] my mom—she’s from Korea, so almost every Korean knows how to play a little bit of piano, right—[and] she would play every once in a while. I climbed up on the bench and started pecking out “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” She saw that I had a knack for it. For several years, I played by ear, and when I was seven, I met my first real classical teacher, Nancy Adsit.
THC: Did you consider a strictly conservatory experience?
CA: Yeah, I did. I applied to a lot of schools, both conservatory and non-conservatory, and a lot of joint programs. I love music but I didn’t know if that is what I wanted to do solely because I was scared that if music didn’t work out, I [would] end up under the bridge. I knew my parents couldn’t support me, so I had to be able to do something where I could support myself. Medicine was something I was really interested in, and business, which is where economics comes in. I knew I wanted to do a joint program because it is a good fall-back.
THC: Do you feel like the joint program has prepared you well as a musician?
CA: Yes. It’s interesting because the joint program itself doesn’t require an immense amount of work. Getting into it is competitive but once you’re in it, you don’t have to go there for classes all the time [and] you can take classes that will double count for your master’s and your bachelor’s [degree]. So, it’s not a lot of work in terms of that, but what takes up a lot of time is traveling and giving concerts. It can get kind of rough.
THC: It has been announced that you are to be the next Artist-in-Residence of Leverett House. What will that be like?
CA: [The position] will begin next year. I’ll be around because I’ll be doing my fifth year of Masters [at the New England Conservatory] so I’m going to be around campus. It’ll be different because my closest friends will all be gone and I technically won’t be a student here. It will be kind of weird ... but I will still know a lot of people.
THC: After you complete your masters degree at the NEC, what do you plan on doing?
CA: I’m not sure. I want to do piano, but it’s hard. I’m giving myself a year and a half until I finish my Masters and seeing where the ball is going. If it looks like it’s going well, I’ll probably keep at it a little longer. If not, then I’ll apply for medical school that year and start the following year.
THC: You’ve played three concerts with Yo-Yo Ma at the age of 22. Are there any musical milestones you have yet to pass?
CA: Oh yeah, an immense amount. It’s not like pre-med. For most people, pre-med is pretty straightforward. It’s very hard, but it’s very straightforward. You go to high school, you go to college, you take pre-med classes, you take the MCAT, you go to med school, do the residency, and you’re a doctor. Easier said than done. But with piano or any music, so much of it is good fortune and luck and having great mentors and being in the right place at the right time. So, it’s a lot harder. There’s no way to become a concert pianist.
THC: What role do you think music will have in your life?
CA: Ideally, I would be a concert pianist, full time, and maybe a professor at a conservatory. That would be ideal but it’s really hard. You know the saying, “How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, Practice, Practice.” [But I think] it’s “practice and be lucky.” Sometimes, I would put my money on me becoming a movie star before a classical musician. But I think music will always be part of my life. I’ll always play for myself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard (12-8, 1-1 Ivy) went up against Cornell and Columbia this weekend at the Murr Tennis Center in the host’s first Ivy League matches of the season. The Crimson lost a close match to the Big Red on Friday, dropping four singles matches to lose, 4-3, but then rebounded against the Lions the next day for a 5-2 victory.
“It was a devastating loss to Cornell because it was so close,” junior Ali Felton said. “We could have beaten them if things went our way. But we bounced back against Columbia. I think we’ve definitely learned from the match against Cornell. We’re really looking forward to next weekend.”
HARVARD 5, COLUMBIA 2
On Saturday, Harvard showed its resilience and took down last year’s Ivy League champion, Columbia (6-12, 0-2 Ivy), 5-2.
The No. 3 duo of Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen earned the first doubles win of the day over juniors Rajeev Deb-Sen and Haig Schneiderman. At first down, 3-1, the Crimson fought back to 5-5, to eventually win, 8-6.
The No. 1 team of freshman Casey MacMaster and captain Aba Omodele-Lucien picked up the squad’s second victory to clinch the doubles point, defeating sophomore Nathaniel Gery and senior Kevin Kung, 8-6.
The No. 2 doubles match was more contested, as a tie-break was required to determine the victor. Junior Jon Pearlman and sophomore Josh Tchan were unable to convert on their first match point, but they eventually came through to help Harvard sweep the doubles matches.
In singles play, No. 1 Pearlman displayed impressive form to win his match, 6-2, 6-3. The Crimson also notched victories from Omodele-Lucien, Felton, and MacMaster. Omodele-Lucien and Felton both needed three sets to pull off victory, but MacMaster won decisively, 6-4, 6-2.
The only blemishes on the day’s record were losses by Nguyen and Tchan at the No. 5 and No. 6 spots, respectively. Nguyen lost a tough three-setter 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 to sophomore John Yetimoglu. Tchan faltered in two close sets, 7-6, 6-4.
CORNELL 4, HARVARD 3
The afternoon matches started with the three doubles teams taking the court, hoping to head into singles play a point ahead.
The Crimson’s team of MacMaster and Omodele-Lucien won their match over seniors Andy Gauthier and Jeremy Feldman, 8-5.
By then the Harvard tandem of Felton and Nguyen had fallen to visiting seniors Evan Bernstein and Jonathan Jaklitsch, 8-4.
The deciding match for the doubles point fell on the shoulders of Pearlman and Tchan. They clinched the doubles point with a win over senior Mirza Klis and McElwain, 8-6.
With the Crimson up 1-0, the Big Red’s No. 2 singles player Gauthier evened the score with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Omodele-Lucien.
But the Harvard players took the lead again when No. 5 MacMaster and No. 3 Felton downed Bernstein and Klis, 6-4, 6-4, and 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, respectively.
Though the Crimson was up, 3-1, and needed only one more win to seal the deal, Cornell surged back with two victories to even the score.
The Big Red’s Jaklitsch edged out Pearlman in a tough close set and then blanked him in the second at the No. 1 position, 7-6 (2), 6-0.
In another three-set thriller, Cornell’s Feldman defeated Nguyen, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, at the No. 4 position.
“I played a very consistent player and got a lot of balls,” Nguyen said. “For me, it was trying to stay in the point, and when I got a short ball, I tried to come in and attack. He was the better player that day.”
Being the last player on the court, with each team holding three points—in the third set, no less—is one of the most difficult situations a tennis player can face. That’s the situation in which Tchan found himself on Friday.
After losing the opening set, 7-5, to the Big Red’s freshman Evan McElwain, Tchan bounced back to tie the match at one set apiece by winning the second set, 6-4.
The two men played down to the wire, leveling the score until it was 3-all in the third. Soon after, McElwain gained momentum and won the next three games, clinching the match with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 victory to push Cornell ahead of the home squad, 4-3.
“It was really nerve-wracking,” Felton said. “There was nothing you can do. You just have to hope that he can pull it out. The last player always feels horrible because they lost the deciding match, but there is really nothing you can do about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s safe to say that it can be difficult for teams to get back into the swing of things after playing only one match in the past month—but not for the Harvard women’s tennis team.
Over the weekend, the No. 54 Crimson (7-6, 2-0 Ivy) defeated both Cornell (8-6, 0-2 Ivy) and Columbia (9-8, 0-2 Ivy) at the Reis Tennis Center in Ithaca, N.Y., and the Dick Savitt Tennis Center in New York, N.Y., respectively, giving up only one point in its first two matches of Ivy League play.
HARVARD 6, COLUMBIA 1
On Saturday, Harvard competed against the Lions in the second match of its opening weekend of Ivy play.
The No. 2 duo of junior co-captain Holly Cao and freshman Hannah Morrill finished first to give the Crimson the edge in doubles play. They defeated Columbia freshmen Bianca Sanon and Tiana Takenaga, 8-1.
Next to finish was the No. 3 team of co-captain Samantha Rosekrans and freshman Natalie Blosser, who secured an 8-4 victory over sophomore Katarina Kovacevic and freshman Ioana Alecsiu to earn the doubles point for Harvard.
Sophomores Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton added to the spotless doubles’ record for the weekend, winning, 8-4, against sophomore Nicole Bartnik and senior Natasha Makarova.
“It was a very solid start to the Ivy League season,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We’ve been training very hard, and we haven’t played in a while, so it was good to get some matches under our belt.”
The Crimson did not let its intensity falter going into the singles part of the match.
Cao, undefeated this season, added another victory to her record. Winning 6-4, 6-1, over Bartnik, she emerged as the first singles win that afternoon.
“I’ve played all of these players before last year,” Cao said. “I just try to stick to my game plan. I try to stay aggressive from the baseline. I knew what their games were like, and nothing was too much of a surprise. I played two pretty solid matches over the weekend, so I’m pretty pleased with that.”
The other singles matches proved to be slightly more difficult for Harvard.
Norton was the next to finish, closing out a tough first set in a tiebreak; she won the match against Kovacevic, 7-6 (5), 6-3.
Morrill, Tachibana, and Blosser also added straight-set wins over the Lions for a 6-0 lead.
The only blemish on the Crimson’s record for the weekend came from the No. 5 singles match between junior Samantha Gridley and Columbia’s Alecsiu, the last match on the court. Alecsiu edged Gridley in the first set, 7-5, and took care of business by winning the second set, 6-1.
“It is definitely a huge confidence boost going into the rest of the Ivies,” Cao said. “Every match will be difficult, and we have to take it one match at a time, but we’re definitely up for the challenge.”
“Anything can happen on any given day. Our team has been really coming together and fighting for each match, one at a time,” Green added.
HARVARD 7, CORNELL 0
On Friday, the Crimson took on the Big Red and won every match with relative ease.
The No. 2 doubles team of Cao and Morrill obtained the first victory for Harvard, beating its Cornell counterparts, sophomore Christine Ordway and freshman Ryann Young, 8-4.
Shortly after, the No. 1 tandem of Tachibana and Norton earned another victory for the Crimson along with the doubles point by defeating freshmen sisters Kelly and Shannon Comolli, 8-5.
With the doubles point clinched, Harvard’s No. 3 team of Rosekrans and Blosser added salt to the wound with an 8-4 victory over seniors Ruxandra Dumitrescu and Sinziana Chis.
“We have been focusing on our doubles play, getting used to our partners, and coming up with different strategies,” Cao said. “It was pretty successful considering that we won all of our doubles matches.”
In singles play, Cao played the Big Red’s Ordway again, demonstrating her consistency with a 6-0, 6-3 win.
The Crimson also notched straight-set victories from Morrill, Tachibana, Gridley, and Norton, in that order, securing Harvard’s victory over Cornell.
Blosser, the lone Crimson player left on the court, edged out her opponent, Kelly Comolli, 7-5, in the first set. In the second set, Blosser was down, 2-1, before Comolli retired, allowing Harvard to blank the Big Red.
“We were pretty rusty, but the rust wore off quickly,” Green said. “And we started playing good Harvard tennis in no time. We just played one match at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team had won just twice in its last 12 contests heading into this past weekend. The woes continued last Friday, when the Crimson (8-11, 0-5 EIVA Hay) was dropped by Sacred Heart (10-8, 4-2), 3-1.
But after dropping the first two sets to Princeton—putting it on the verge of losing yet another contest—the Harvard men’s volleyball team won the match’s final three games to pull out a 3-2 victory Saturday.
The win over the Tigers (3-15, 1-8 EIVA Tait) helped the Crimson earn its first road win of the season while snapping a six-game losing streak.
“[This victory] means a lot to us,” junior co-captain Matt Jones said. “This is our first road victory of the season, and that means a lot, since we are a young team.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
Jones and freshman Kyle Rehkemper played a key role in Harvard’s victory at Dillon Gym in Princeton, N.J., leading their squad with 14 and 13 kills, respectively.
In the first set, neither team could grab the advantage until a kill by Princeton freshman Jeff Stapleton started a 4-0 run to give the home team a 17-11 lead.
The Crimson cut the score to 23-19, but Princeton recovered though and closed out the first set, 25-19.
Late in the second set, a Harvard service error gave Princeton a 24-19 advantage and put the Crimson on the edge of a 2-0 game hole. A kill by sophomore Michael Dye gave the Tigers a commanding two-set lead.
“We came out a little flat the first couple of games,” Jones said. “As the game progressed, we started competing harder, and most importantly, we shifted our [defense] and started picking up a lot more of their off-speed shots.”
The Crimson came out strong in the third set and held onto the lead until Princeton’s 5-1 run gave the home team an 11-8 lead. When Tigers junior Scott Liljestrom tallied a kill, Princeton had a comfortable 21-17 and needed only four points for a clean sweep of the visitors.
But the Crimson wouldn’t give in.
Jones and Rehkemper each recorded one kill en route to a 7-1 run that gave the visitors the pivotal third set.
“We battled back ... after dropping the first two [games],” Rehkemper said. “We had a couple of good overhand serves and some nice blocks. We really finished that [third] game, whereas we couldn’t finish out the first two. We just took [the set win] and rode it out the rest of the match.”
Neither team could pull ahead in the fourth set, until a 3-0 Harvard run gave the Crimson a 19-18 lead; later, a 5-1 run helped Harvard pull out the set and tie the match at 2-2.
In the deciding fifth set, the visitors made sure it wasn’t even close. The Crimson jumped out to a 12-3 lead, capped off by three consecutive serving aces.
The lead proved to be too much, and a kill ended the set, 15-6, and the match.
SACRED HEART 3, HARVARD 1
Traveling to the Pitt Center in Fairfield, Conn., Harvard jumped out to a quick start in the first set against the Pioneers, taking a 5-1 advantage by capitalizing on four Sacred Heart errors.
The Crimson maintained the lead at 17-12 until the Pioneers rallied with four consecutive point—the last of which came off a combined block by freshmen Bradley Borsay and Patrick Sibley. Borsay had 12 kills, while Sibley contributed 11 kills in the match.
A Sibley kill completed the comeback and provided the Pioneers with a 25-22 first-set win.
Sacred Heart carried over its strong play to the second set, jumping out to a 6-3 lead.
A Jones kill pulled the score to 16-15, keeping the Crimson’s hopes alive, but a service ace by Pioneers senior Tim Sadowski pushed the score to 23-19, and Sacred Heart ended up putting away the set, 25-22, giving it a daunting 2-0 lead.
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead in the third set, but the Pioneers came back again, knotting the score at 20-apiece off a kill by freshman Enzo Mackenzie.
The teams made alternating runs at the end of the third set, resulting in a 23-23 tie. A Harvard kill and Sacred Heart service error pulled out the win for the Crimson, cutting the deficit to 2-1.
Sensing a momentum shift, the Pioneers doubled their efforts to ensure Harvard didn’t get any closer.
Sacred Heart rallied off seven consecutive points to start the fourth set, establishing a lead it would not relinquish en route to a 25-19 win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taking on the Colonial Relays, the Sam Howell Invitational, and the Snowflake Classic this past weekend, the Crimson squad divided and conquered to bring back several IC4A- and ECAC-qualifying scores.
“Twelve people made regional-level qualifying marks,” senior Dan Chenoweth said. “I think that it was a good trip overall.”
SAM HOWELL INVITATIONAL
A contingent of Harvard vertical jumpers made its way down to Princeton this past Saturday to take on some of the toughest competition in the Ancient Eight.
Clearing the bar at 1.70 meters to match her personal best, sophomore Mary Hirst captured third in the high jump behind Columbia’s Monique Roberts and Tara Richmond. Her mark, good enough for an ECAC ticket, also marks the fourth best in team history.
Sophomores Sydnie Leroy and Fedor Garin also secured slots in later competition action through dual second-place pole vault finishes—Leroy captured an ECAC qualification with a mark of 3.70 meters, and Garin matched his personal best of 4.80 meters to garner an IC4A qualification.
Although the outdoor season is still quite young, these marks will be crucial for later tournament bids.
“One of the great things about setting good marks early in the season is that [it has] a role later in the season when it comes to seeding,” Chenoweth explained.
SNOWFLAKE CLASSIC
Another group from the Crimson track and field squad stayed local for the weekend, making the short trip up to Tufts in Medford, Mass., on Saturday to compete in the throwing events.
On the women’s side, sophomore Shannon Watt won the discus with an ECAC mark of 43.11 meters and the shot put with 12.09 meter toss.
The Harvard men saw a 1-2 finish in the discus throw, as sophomore Edward Brucker claimed the winning mark of 48.68 meters, good for an IC4A qualifier, and rookie Dustin Brode settled below his teammate on the leaderboard with a distance of 44.35 meters.
The pair switched up the order of finish in the shot put, but both of their marks were good enough for IC4A qualifications.
The Crimson similarly dominated competition in the hammer throw. Senior Eric Clayman punched his IC4A ticket with a throw of 55.96 meters, and co-captain Ablorde Ashigbi snagged the No. 2 finish with a mark of 51.32 meters.
“I think that we did particularly well this past weekend,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We had a number of standout performances, and the team overall got a great experience with the competition.”
COLONIAL RELAYS
For the third meet, Chenoweth and the other Crimson runners hit the road Thursday through Saturday for the Colonial Relays at William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va., where they gained valuable experience for tougher matchups down the road.  “I was pretty pleased with how our distance runners performed this past weekend,” Saretsky said. “I know that it’s still early in the season, but I think that their best performances are still ahead of them.”
But a better performance may be hard for some. In what Saretsky called “stand-out” performances, senior Claire Richardson nailed down a third-place finish in the 5K, and Chenoweth won on the men’s side. Co-captain Brian Hill also nabbed a No. 2 finish in the 800 meters.
Yet to Chenoweth, more important than winning was the team’s experience.
“Getting good outdoor racing experience helps us all acclimate to the conditions for the rest of the season,” the Illinois native explained.
The qualifying marks also continued to roll in for Harvard.
The 4x800 team of sophomore Jeffrey Homer, juniors Darcy Wilson and Brian Paison, and Hill finished just behind Virginia Tech with an IC4A-worthy time of 7:38.19.
On the women’s side, senior Hilary May, freshman Natalia Paine, junior Meghan Looney, and rookie Alaina Murphy captured fourth place in the relay thanks to May’s powerful opening leg. The mark was good enough for yet another ECAC qualification.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dealing with damp spots from the previous day’s precipitation along with strong gusts, the Harvard men’s golf team managed to defeat both Dartmouth and host Yale and propel itself to a fourth-place overall finish at the Yale Spring Opener in New Haven, Conn.
“It was really a battle of the conditions,” Crimson sophomore Max Campion said. “It was quite cold, extremely windy, and playing a course that really was not in summer conditions, but we fared well against other schools in the battle.”
The Crimson scored 303 and 306 in the first and second rounds, respectively.
Shooting a 49-over total overall, Harvard came in fourth out of 10 teams in competition by the end of Saturday.
The University of Rhode Island came in first with a 37-over 597, shooting 296 in the first and 301 in the second.
Crimson junior Mark Pollak led the way for Harvard, shooting 71 and 75 to tie for the individual title with an overall score of six over par.
Rams freshman Andrew Fiorenzano and Holy Cross sophomore Steve Zychowski also shared a piece of the crown.
“It was kind of a surprise,” Pollak said. “I’ve been playing really poorly for a while, leading up to the tournament. Something just clicked on the range in the morning before we went out, and I just took that confidence with me.”
Campion chipped in with the Crimson’s second-best score, turning in a 12-over-par 152 to finish in a tie with Rhode Island senior Billy McDonald for 17th place.
Ending up in a four-way tie for 26th place, freshman Theodore Lederhausen was three strokes behind Campion with a 152.
Freshman Kevin McCarthy and junior Connor Wentzell shot 159 and 160 to wind up in a tie for 38th and 42nd, respectively.
And rookie Michael Lai rounded out Harvard’s competitors with a 32-over-par 172 to finish in 64th.
Despite posting higher scores than Rhode Island, Sacred Heart (601), and Temple (607), Harvard was able to come out on top of the Big Green and the Bulldogs, which placed fifth and seventh, respectively.
With the Ivy League Championships looming at the end of the spring season, the most recent results gave the Crimson more confidence going forward.
“We’re just trying to build our confidence,” Pollack said. “Especially the two teams we beat were Ivy League rivals, it’s just something to build on and continue to work for the rest of the season.”
“We know that we’ve got a great shot this year at the Ivies,” Campion added. “And beating them this week was huge. We’re just looking to bring our confidence to the upcoming tournaments.”
Since the dual match between Harvard and Columbia two weeks ago was canceled, the Opener was the Crimson’s first opportunity this spring for players to showcase their talents and efforts that they put in during the offseason.
“We were working in the bubble across the river in addition to the new golf center we’ve been using,” Campion said, “so over the winter we spent quite a bit more time practicing.”
“It was just really good to see a lot of work I put in the offseason pay off,” Pollack added.
The tournament was also a chance for Harvard to get back to a competition-ready mentality.
“We really consider the Yale Spring Opener as the practice tournament to get us prepared for the rest of the season,” Pollack said. “There’s still a lot of variability in turf condition and weather, so we look at this tournament to get ourselves ready for the rest of the season.”
“I thought that it was a fine start to the season,” Campion added. “We accomplished our goal of getting ready for the Ivies. Obviously we would’ve really liked to win, and it seemed like a field we could’ve beaten. But it was a decent start.”
As the weather continues to improve and courses get into better shape, the Crimson will look to best its Ivy competition again next week at the Princeton Invitational.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team may be five weeks deep into its schedule, but the real season has just begun.
The Crimson (18-10, 4-0 Ivy) opened conference play on the road this weekend and didn’t waste any time asserting itself as the favorite to defend its Ivy League North title.
With strong pitching from junior Rachel Brown and freshman Laura Ricciardone and a combined 13 RBI from co-captain Ellen Macadam and rookie Kasey Lange, Harvard swept its four-game set with South Division foes Penn (10-11, 2-2) and Columbia (8-19, 0-4).
The Crimson recorded 2-1 and 10-0 victories over the Quakers on Saturday before turning in matching 4-2 wins over the Lions yesterday.
“It was a great weekend to open the Ivies,” junior Whitney Shaw said. “We just did a great job of sticking with the other teams and working inning to inning and making sure we came up with the results.”
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 2
In its weekend finale, Macadam made sure Harvard got off on the right foot, putting the second pitch of the game over the left-field fence en route to a 4-2 Crimson win.
“Ellen’s a veteran, and she came out really poised and came out really focused,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “She battled every at-bat—I thought she was one of our toughest outs all weekend.”
Macadam’s solo shot gave the Crimson an early 1-0 lead, an advantage that the squad doubled in the fourth. Lange led off the inning with a double and came around to score on freshman Alison Scott’s double to left center.
Lange then made the lead 4-0 in the top of the fifth, driving in Macadam and co-captain Emily Henderson with a single to right.
Ricciardone held Columbia scoreless until the seventh but couldn’t quite hold on for her second shutout of the weekend.
Alison Lam scored the Lions’ first run on a fielding error, and Jennifer Bergeron drove in a second run with a single. But that was as close as Columbia got, as Ricciardone got Karen Tulig to hit into a fielder’s choice to end the game.
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 2
In yesterday’s opener, Lange’s third-inning grand slam provided all the offense the Crimson and pitcher Brown would need in a 4-2 win at CU Softball Stadium.
Lange’s bomb to center field plated sophomore Ashley Heritage, Macadam, and sophomore Stephanie Regan, who had reached base on three straight Columbia errors.
“Kasey was on fire at Columbia,” Shaw said. “She did absolutely great. She just focused in and really picked us up offensively.”
The Lions jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first on Anne Marie Skylis’s RBI single, but Brown kept Columbia quiet until the seventh, when Christie Taylor led off with a home run down the left-field line.
Brown sat down the next three Lions in order to finish off her second consecutive 11-strikeout complete game.
“Columbia came out and was pretty aggressive,” Allard said. “But [Brown and Ricciardone] did a pretty good job of keeping them off the bases and keeping the opponent’s offensive production down, and letting us win with our bats.”
HARVARD 10, PENN 0 (5 inn.)
For the third time in four games, Harvard reached double digits on the scoreboard, while strong pitching from Ricciardone gave the Crimson an easy 10-0 win in a five-inning game at Warren Field.
Though both offenses were relatively quiet through the first three innings, with Harvard taking a 1-0 lead in the third off a sacrifice fly from Regan, the Crimson broke the game open in the fourth.
Junior Mari Zumbro opened the inning with a dinger to left off of reliever Taylor Tieman, and junior Jane Alexander and co-captain Emily Henderson followed with back-to-back singles. With one out, Macadam and Regan launched matching RBI doubles to left to bring the score to 5-0.
Lange singled through the left side to bring Regan home, and Harvard took advantage of a pair of Quaker errors to put two more runs on the board before the inning was over.
Macadam iced the game with a two-run bomb to center field in the fifth, putting the run rule into effect at the end of the inning.
Ricciardone quietly dominated the Penn offense, allowing just a fourth-inning single in her five-inning shutout while fanning five.
“The pitchers did great ... they really buckled down and focused on their game to allow the defense and offense to focus on their game,” Shaw said. “Laura pitched outstanding—in her first Ivy game, she just completely shut them down.”
HARVARD 2, PENN 1
The Ivy opener between the Crimson and Quakers on Saturday afternoon turned out to be a showcase of aces, with Brown coming out on top over Penn rookie Mikenzie Voves in a 2-1 victory.
The Quakers nearly got on the board in the first inning, but Henderson ranged over the center-field fence to pull back a would-be home run off the bat of Alisha Prystowsky.
Henderson then provided the catalyst for Harvard’s first run, drawing a walk to lead off the third inning. She moved to second on a sacrifice from Heritage and came around to score on Macadam’s RBI single.
The Crimson doubled its advantage in the sixth when Shaw launched a homer to center.
Penn got one back in the bottom of the inning, with Samantha Erosa reaching base on a walk and coming around on an error and a wild pitch. But Brown struck out the side in the seventh to hold on to her one-hitter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y.—The Crimson baseball team hoped that the beginning of Ivy League play would present a fresh start. Unfortunately for Harvard, a weekend trip to New York did little to end its struggles.
The Crimson (3-19, 0-4 Ivy) dropped all four of its road contests against Penn and Columbia, losing a doubleheader to the Quakers in Philadelphia on Saturday before falling short in a pair of games against the Lions yesterday.
Harvard made it a habit this weekend of turning things around late, but the visitors’ rallies never proved to be enough. The Crimson opened the weekend with a lopsided 8-1 defeat against Penn before storming back in the nightcap. The squad could not hold its lead and fell in 12 innings, 8-7. Harvard couldn’t muster the same level of offense against Columbia, posting 11-2 and 8-0 defeats over the day.
“We’re struggling right now,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “We’re a better team than we’re showing out there.”
COLUMBIA 8, HARVARD 0
The Lions (11-11, 2-2) carried the momentum from a solid first-game effort, scoring runs in the first three innings against Crimson junior starter Conner Hulse. Hulse’s counterpart, Stefan Olson, continued a run of dominant Columbia pitching, tossing seven scoreless frames to keep the reeling Harvard offense at bay.
“We get guys on base a lot, we’ve just got to score them,” captain Tyler Albright said. “Hitting is contagious for us, so we’ve just got to get our leadoff guys on, and I think the rest of the guys will come through.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, it never could find a rhythm against Olson or reliever Harrison Slutsky, failing to reach base at all from the fourth through seventh innings. The Lions, on the other hand, plated four additional runs in the seventh, pushing the lead to 8-0 en route to a two-game sweep.
COLUMBIA 11, HARVARD 2
A sluggish start hurt the Crimson on Sunday morning, as junior Brent Suter yielded five runs in the bottom of the first before senior Dan Berardo came on to relieve. Lions pitcher Dan Bracey had an easier time, relying on solid defense behind him. Sophomore Danny Moskovits earned Harvard’s first hit of the day with two outs in the third, lacing a double to left-center field that rolled all the way to the wall. Senior Dillon O’Neill then worked a full count before looping a line drive the opposite way in right center. But center field Nick Cox—who was four-for-four at the plate in the nightcap—made a nice break on the ball from center field and came up with a diving catch to save a run.
“Defense was solid today,” Albright said. “Columbia made some really nice plays in the field, and so did we.”
With the Columbia defense committing just one error all day, the Lions’ offense kept the pressure on.
Designated hitter Dario Pizzano belted a three-run home run in bottom of the fifth for an 8-0 lead, and the home team would push it to 10-0 before Harvard struck. The visitors notched a pair of runs in the top of the sixth on RBI doubles from juniors Jeff Reynolds and Marcus Way, but the Crimson could not close the gap. Columbia closed out the seven-inning contest, 11-2, for its first Ivy win.
PENN 8, HARVARD 7 (12 INNINGS)
The nightcap between the Quakers (12-10, 4-0) and the Crimson highlighted the importance of key defensive stops, as three Harvard errors resulted in eight unearned runs for Penn. The Crimson erased any bitter taste left from the morning loss with a three-run outburst in the top of the first, capped by a two-RBI single from O’Hara. But Penn took advantage of the shortstop’s throwing error in the bottom half for six unearned runs against senior starter Max Perlman.
Perlman would not allow another run until the sixth inning, as Harvard fought back yet again. The Crimson plated a run in the third and two in the fourth—including a steal of home by O’Neill—before Way belted a solo homerun in the fifth to give the visitors a 7-6 lead.
But Penn would scratch out another unearned run in the bottom of the sixth, this time resulting from a Perlman throwing error. The senior ace finished the day with four strikeouts in seven innings and a no-decision.
Despite six errors from the Quakers, Harvard could not muster any more runs of its own, as the bats on both sides went quiet until the 12th. Senior Ben Sestanovich came on in relief after four scoreless innings from junior Will Keuper and fell victim to another throwing error. After allowing a leadoff single, Sestanovich attempted to field a sacrifice bunt only to hit the runner in the back with his throw, allowing Dan Williams to advance to third. The Crimson intentionally loaded the bases to face Spencer Branigan, but the designated hitter lofted a fly ball deep enough to score Williams, sending Harvard to an 0-2 start in Ivy play.
PENN 8, HARVARD 1
The first Ancient Eight game of the season featured much less drama. Senior Eric Eadington and Penn hurler Paul Cusick were locked in a pitching duel through two innings, before Harvard broke through in the top of the third. Albright reached base on a fielding error, and a sacrifice bunt and O’Neill single moved the captain to third. Franklin’s groundout proved enough to plate Albright and stake the Crimson to a 1-0 lead.
But Penn would fire right back, as Rick Brebner belted a homerun to right to tie the game. From there, luck seemed to swing toward the Quakers. A pair of infield singles and errors set Penn up for three more runs in the frame—a lead Harvard could not make up. The Quakers would add three runs in the fifth and one in the sixth, plenty of offense behind Cusick’s complete-game, 12-strikeout performance.
“It was a difficult weekend, but it’s the Ivy League—we’ve got 16 more games and anything could happen,” Albright said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starbucks employees, Harvard workers, and students joined together on Friday to protest a talk by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who spoke at Harvard Business School about his experiences running the international coffeehouse chain as well as about his new book, “Onward.”
The protesters gathered to call for better working conditions at Starbucks, which the National Labor Relations Board—a federal agency charged with investigating unfair labor practices—has found to have wrongfully terminated employees and violated labor laws.
The protest, which took place outside of Spangler Auditorium at the Business School, was organized by members of the Starbucks Workers Union (SWU), who said they felt it was necessary to rally in order to expose Harvard students to the controversy regarding Schultz.
“We were showing the opposite voice [and] revealing the truth,” said Starbucks barista and rally organizer Anja Witek, who said she flew from her home in Minnesota to attend the event.
Organizers estimated that 25 to 30 individuals came out to protest Schultz’s talk. During the protest, several Starbucks employees shared their experiences with the crowd, alleging instances of spying and union busting and claiming they had faced pressure against union membership.
“They tell [workers] there is no such thing as a Starbucks union,” Witek said. “That is just simply not true.”
Beyond sharing their individual experiences, speakers at the event criticized Schultz for his refusal to meet with the SWU. Several speakers claimed that he was actively avoiding union members in order to avoid any sort of negotiations.
“This is a man worth $1.1 billion, and he’s running away from low-wage workers,” said Starbucks barista and union organizer Liberté Locke. Locke and others called for Schultz to face the workers he is allegedly mistreating instead of presenting his company as labor-friendly.
Organizers of the event—as well as several workers and students in attendance—said they thought the protest was successful in bringing attention to the accusations of poor working conditions at Starbucks.
“Howard definitely heard us,” Witek said of the rally, adding that “students came out from the lecture and said that they had heard us.”
Anna J. Murphy ’12, who was among the protesters, also called the rally a success.
“The event was to put pressure on [Schultz], to embarrass him, to make people going to this event see that whatever claims Schultz is making in his book, really, he is afraid,” Murphy said.
Geoff Carens, an assistant librarian and member of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said he came out to the protest in order to show solidarity with his fellow workers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The much anticipated rematch between the EARC co-Crews of the Year, Harvard and Cornell, turned out to be rather one-sided.
The No. 3 Crimson men’s heavyweight crew team topped the No. 6 Big Red by 17.9 seconds in the first varsity eight race and completed a Harvard sweep of its EARC rival.
The two squads were among the few who braved the conditions of the Charles on Saturday morning. Several teams, including the Radcliffe heavyweights, originally planned to race on the Charles but moved the location of their races on account of the conditions.
“It was like surf-rowing,” said junior five-seat Mike DiSanto. “It was pretty ridiculous. There was a very strong headwind and waves breaking over the bow ball.”
The conditions were particularly bad in the first varsity eight race, the final event of the day. The wind and whitecaps forced crews to row at lower stroke ratings than usual.
“I think we went down to a 31,” said captain and varsity two-seat Anthony Locke. “We’re usually at a 36. I think we topped off at the start at 37 where we’re usually at a 45. It was such tricky conditions. It was difficult to row well.”
The Crimson took advantage of better water in the second 500 to make its biggest move of the day, granting the squad an insurmountable lead by the halfway point.
“By 1000 meters, we had a full length of open [water],” DiSanto said. “By then, it was pretty hard for them—and for us—to keep going. But we had the advantage.”
“We definitely tried to push on them in the second 1000,” Locke added.
And Harvard continued building its lead throughout the second half of the race to win by nearly 18 seconds. But DiSanto said Cornell may be faster than the results indicate.
“I think their boat was pretty water-logged,” he said. “I think their bow was almost completely submerged by the finish. It was a fun race. Obviously it’s good to win, but you obviously can’t take too much stock in that race.”
The water had worsened over the course of the morning to the point that the first varsity eight race was actually the slowest event of the day. But DiSanto attributed the times in part to the depth of the team.
“I know we are such a deep squad,” he said, “Throughout the season, it won’t be surprising to see the 3V close to the 2V and the 2V close to the varsity. There’s just so much talent. Guys have worked really hard. If one boat doesn’t have a good piece or one boat has a really good piece, they’ll be able to catch the boat [that’s ahead of them]. That’s going to help the squad as a whole get faster...it’ll make sure you’re on your game.”
While the first varsity eight won convincingly, the second and third varsity eights won by much tighter margins, with both boats rallying from starting down.
“I think all the boats had very strong races, particularly the 2V and 3V,” Locke said. “They did a fantastic job”
In the second varsity eight race, the Big Red went a length up early in the race, but the Crimson walked through Cornell’s crew for a 9.3 second win.
“That’s encouraging to hear that the guys stayed relaxed and trusted the coxswain,” DiSanto said.
Harvard’s third varsity eight never had the luxury of a nine-second lead but was able to eke out a 2.2-second win.
“I heard it was a very hard-fought race,” DiSanto said. “It’s great to know guys on your team dug deep on got the victory.”
The freshmen had no such trouble. The freshman eight led off the start and kept moving for a 14.3 second victory.
“The freshmen also had a really good race, which will give them confidence as they get used to college racing,” Locke said. “They have bigger races coming up. It was a good confidence builder for them.”
While the Crimson pulled off the sweep this time, the rowers know of the Big Red’s ability to peak for later races.
“They haven’t spent a lot of time on the water,” Locke said. “We’re expecting them to get quicker and to have much more competitive races.”
While Harvard’s top boats were taking care of business on the Charles, a crew of fourth-varsity and second-freshman boat rowers was dispatching the first varsity eights from the University of Vermon and Tulane University on Malden River in Medford, Mass. The Crimson’s 4V and 2F edged Vermon by 4.1 seconds and dominated Tulane by 34.2 seconds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team (11-9, 2-2 CWPA) had a busy Saturday afternoon, hosting a doubleheader against Connecticut College (4-7) and Marist College (9-15) at Blodgett Pool.
Though both games resulted in victories for the Crimson, the twinbill was a tale of two games: while Harvard easily dispatched the Camels, 19-2, the squad needed two periods of extra play to topple the Red Foxes, 13-12.
Saturday was also Senior Day for the Crimson. The team’s two veterans, goalie Shami Entenman and attacker and co-captain Patricia Smith, played in the last home games of their collegiate careers. Younger members of the Harvard squad wanted to give the duo a pleasant memory of their last games at Blodgett Pool.
“I think that was definitely a motivating factor at the end of the game,” junior attacker Monica Zdrojewski said. “Our seniors are great and we’re going to miss them a lot, so we wanted to send them out on a high note.”
HARVARD 13, MARIST COLLEGE 12
With six seconds left in overtime and the score leveled at 12-12, sophomore defender Elise Molnar found her classmate, attacker Aisha Price, three meters from the goal. Molnar lobbed the ball to Price, and as the final seconds were ticking off the clock, the sophomore rose up and hurled the ball toward goal.
Price’s shot split two Marist defenders and found the back of the net, giving her team a one-point advantage with just three seconds left in the game. This was all that the Crimson needed, as time expired during the Red Foxes’ attempt to even the score.
“Aisha at three meters at center goal, I’ll take that all day, every day,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “She’s got a cannon.”
Following her game-winning shot, Price’s teammates rushed to the center of the pool to celebrate with the sophomore.
Though all eyes were on her after the game, Price felt that the other members of the team also deserved recognition for their contributions in the squad’s victory.
“I was just the lucky one who got to put the last one in,” Price said.
It seemed as if Marist was in control of Saturday’s matchup from the get-go. The Red Foxes picked up a lead early in the game and were on top by three points twice during the contest. The Crimson found itself trailing, 9-6, in the third period of play.
Minnis said that the team changed its defensive scheme midway through the contest. The coach was unhappy with how many isolations Marist had but felt that the alteration on defense solved the problem and allowed his team to make a comeback.
“That was a big turning point in the game,” Minnis said.
With two goals from Zdrojewski and one from Price, the squad knotted the game at nine apiece. Following a go-ahead score from Marist, Harvard junior attacker Shannon Purcell scored with 4:57 left in the fourth quarter to tie the game, 10-10.
The Red Foxes nearly pulled off the victory with a game-winner of their own. With 15 seconds to go in regulation, senior defender Agnes Konopka’s shot got by Crimson junior goalie Laurel McCarthy but sailed just over the goal.
When Harvard faced Marist on the road earlier in the season, the Red Foxes earned the victory, 13-10.
Members of the Crimson team were glad to have avenged the loss, and Price pointed to the change of venue, among other things, as a contributing factor.
“It’s always an advantage playing at home in our bigger pool,” the sophomore said. “We have some great speed that we utilized today. We went to California and improved a lot; I think this goes to show how much we’ve improved.”
HARVARD 19, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 2
In the first game of the doubleheader, Harvard was firing on all cylinders and topped the Camels by one of the largest margins of its season.
The Crimson raced to a six-point lead in the first period and didn’t relent, until a goal from freshman attacker Christy DiSilvestro put the team on top, 18-0. Connecticut College avoided being shut out with two fourth-period goals.
Eleven members of the Harvard squad scored in the team’s matchup with the Camels. Freshman attacker Shayna Price was a top performer for the squad in the early game.
The Honolulu, Hawaii, native tallied up three goals, two assists, and three steals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 20 Radcliffe heavyweight crew’s races proved to be grisly on Saturday when it lost all four races to No. 5 Brown.
Originally taking place at the Charles River, the head-to-head contest changed locations to the Seekonk River in Providence, R.I. Although the water was suitable for racing, the Seekonk River had increasing crosswinds throughout the day. The Bears handled the gusting winds well, but the weather and the change away from their home river did not fare well for the the Black and White.
Radcliffe rowed neck-and-neck with the Bears in the varsity eight race but ultimately lost by 2.43 seconds. Brown finished with a time of 6:27.30, while the Black and White had a time of 6:29.73. Radcliffe exploded off the line first, and the race stayed very even for the first 500 meters, but during the second 500 meters, the Bears moved in on the Black and White and gained a half-boat lead. The loss of the lead seems to have been due to troubles within the Radcliffe team.
“We didn’t exactly know how hard we were able to push ourselves,” said sophomore four-seat Celia Kohl. “The second 500 is where you really settle into your base pace that you’re going to race that middle portion of the race at, and I think that we had more in us that we weren’t aware of.”
Brown looked to push to get the Black and White’s bow, but Radcliffe refused to yield.
The third 500 meters saw the two teams race at the same speed, until the the Black and White moved back in on the Bears in the final 500 meters. Radcliffe’s final sprint did not make up enough of what it lost earlier in the race, and Brown came out with the win.
The following event was less contested: the second varsity eight race saw the Bears easily come out on top.
The Black and White began the race slower than Brown and stayed behind the entire 2000 meters. In the final stretch, Radcliffe was able to push back a little, but Brown was too far ahead at that point to give the Black and White a chance at victory.
Radcliffe rowed at 32 strokes per minute in the loss.
“The good thing is that even though we lost by a lot, it was definitely an underperformance on our part,” said co-captain Rachel Rauh, coxswain of the second varsity eight. “We’ve had some fairly successful practices, and it kind of felt like our race yesterday was a step back, so we really just need to regroup and really figure out how to perform on race day. Everyone needs to get on the same page in terms of what our goals and expectations are.”
The second varsity eight race saw a 6:31.93 finish by the Bears and a 6:44.36 finish from Radcliffe, creating a 12.43 second difference.
The third race of the day was the third varsity eight race. The Black and White lost this matchup by the largest margin of the day, 15.81 seconds. Brown finished in 6:55.73, while Radcliffe rowed the race in 7:11.74.
The day concluded with the varsity fours race. Brown had two teams competing in this event, both of which finished before the Black and White. The Bears’ A and B teams crossed the finish line in 7:31.92 minutes and 7:35.01 minutes, respectively. Radcliffe followed 15.49 seconds after Brown A in a time of 7:47.41.
Nodding towards the future, the Black and White seeks to improve its performance by looking at itself, not the opponent.
“We don’t really tailor our race plan week-to-week based on who we’re competing against,” Rauh said. “The plan really is for us to race our own race and stay focused on what we need to do, rather than reacting to the competition.”
Radcliffe also is taking its losses over the weekend in stride, looking at the positives from Saturday.
“I think this is a great race for us to have in the beginning of the season,” Kohl said. “Obviously, we would have loved to come out with a win, but I think we learned a lot this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Headed to the University of Albany coming off a comeback victory over No. 16 UMass last Tuesday and looking ahead to rival No. 7 Cornell next weekend, the No. 20 Harvard men’s lacrosse team was in great danger of falling prey to a trap game against the Great Danes Saturday afternoon.
And for the second straight weekend, the Crimson (6-3) fell on the road by one goal, losing 12-11 to Albany (4-5) at John Fallon Field.
In a back-and-forth contest in which neither team was able to gain more than a two-goal advantage, Danes attack Miles Thompson scored twice in the final 2:14 to give his team the win.
“It was a disappointing loss,” junior attack Jeff Cohen said. “It was a game I felt we should’ve won.”
A high-scoring first quarter saw nine total goals, as Albany jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead when attacks Joe Resetarits and Ty Thompson scored within six seconds of each other in the third minute of action.
“I think we came out flat,” freshman attack Daniel Eipp said. “Emotionally, I don’t think we were there for whatever reason.”
But Harvard responded right back, with junior midfielder Terry White scoring just 14 seconds after Thompson, and co-captain Dean Gibbons tying the game shortly over a minute later.
Gibbons’ next goal, his 20th of the year, was sandwiched between two scores from Ty Thompson, whose hat trick gave the Danes a 4-3 lead. But junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan and senior attack Matt Hull each scored in the final 3:18 of the period to give Harvard the 5-4 advantage after one.
Ty Thompson scored his fourth goal of the contest 1:16 into the second period, but Eipp responded under a minute later to put Harvard back ahead.
At 7:44, Resetarits beat Harvard sophomore goalie Harry Krieger for his second score of the contest. Cohen tallied his team-leading 22nd goal of the season with 2:39 left in the period to put Harvard up 7-6, but the Danes tied things up again with just eight seconds remaining in the half on a Brian Caufield score.
“We didn’t pull away with a lead off the bat like I think we could’ve,” Eipp said. “We weren’t clicking as a team.”
In the third, an unassisted goal on a bouncing shot from the left by Crimson sophomore attack Ryan Stevens was sandwiched by two Miles Thompson goals that put Albany ahead, 9-8, heading into the final period.
Harvard jumped out to an early lead in the fourth on two Eipp scores, both assisted by Gibbons. The freshman’s first goal came from the right of the crease off Gibbons’ pass from behind the net, and Eipp finished the hat-trick with a spinning underhand shot shortly thereafter.
“I was trying to take advantage of my matchup,” Eipp said. “My defender wasn’t as quick as other defenders I’ve seen in the past. I tried isolating him at times and playing a one-on-one game with him, which worked.”
Albany’s Ryan Feurstein beat Krieger from the left side a minute later, but Crimson sophomore midfielder Jack Doyle responded by firing one into the lower right-hand corner of the net from the middle of the zone.
With Harvard up 11-10 with 11:12 to go, neither team could score until Caufield split two defenders at the top of the zone and hit Miles Thompson, who beat Krieger with a sidearm shot from the left to tie things up at the 2:14 mark.
The Crimson won the ensuing faceoff, but White turned the ball over, and, in transition, Miles Thompson spun right and fired a low shot past Krieger to put the Danes up one with 1:17 left.
Harvard junior defenseman Daniel DiMaria forced a turnover in Albany’s zone with 24 seconds to go and was able to clear. But with five seconds remaining, Stevens’ final attempt soared wide left, and Albany held on for its first win in five games.
Krieger had just four saves for Harvard, while freshman Edmund Cathers had 12 for Albany. Eipp’s three goals led the Crimson, while the Thompsons had four each for the Danes.
Harvard lost despite taking more shots (41-28), winning more ground balls (38-25) and faceoffs (19-8), and having fewer turnovers (18-17) than its opponent.
“It’s a game we’re going to have to learn from and move on,” Cohen said. “I think it would have been great if we were able to pull away but we need to get better at winning the close games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling behind 6-0 with 10:27 left in the first half, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team took a stand.
The Crimson (4-4, 2-1 Ivy) responded with eight unanswered goals to pull out an 8-6 victory over New Hampshire (5-5, 0-1 America East) Friday night under the lights at Harvard Stadium. Sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen, who finished with a team-high three scores, notched the tying and winning goals in the victory.
New Hampshire got on the board first with a goal by junior JoJo Curro. Starting from behind the net, Curro gave a quick spin move and slipped a wrap-around shot past junior goalie Kerry Clark for the first score.
A goal by junior Hayley Rausch and consecutive scores by sophomore Amber Casiano gave the Wildcats a 4-0 lead with 16:37 remaining in the half.
New Hampshire further extended its lead with goals from senior Allie Duclos and sophomore Jenny Simpson. Junior Ilana Cohen gave a nifty pass from behind the net to a streaking Duclos, who fired the shot into the goal.
After the score, which extended the Wildcats lead to 6-0, it seemed that Harvard was in for a long night.
“I think we came out a little slow in the first half,” VanderMeulen said. “[After the] 6-0 lead by UNH, [we] were taken aback…and it was [like] alright, this is enough.”
Just nine seconds after the goal from Duclos, junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind ignited the Crimson comeback. Baskind took the draw and raced down the field on a one-man fast break, firing a low shot past the keeper that finally put Harvard on the board.
“Mel had a great momentum goal, and we started to build off that,” VanderMeulen said.
Junior Jess Halpern continued the rally with a score off an attack from behind the net, cutting New Hampshire’s lead to 6-2.
Harvard ended the half in a fury, scoring three goals in the final minute and 23 seconds of the half.
Halpern started the streak, notching a score with 1:23 remaining. Sophomore Danielle Tetreault followed with a quick goal just over a minute later off an attack from the right sideline.
The two goals put the Crimson down two with 16 seconds left in the half.
But VanderMeulen would not concede that Harvard was done for the half. The sophomore took a pass from freshman Chelsey Newman and wrapped a shot around the goalie for a score with only four ticks remaining.
The goal completed the momentum shift, as Harvard entered the locker room only down one goal, 6-5, to the Wildcats.
“I thought the defensive unit did a nice job adjusting and the attack started to score in transition,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “[The team] adjusted to a different game plan and got a little bit mad and played with a bit more energy and intensity.”
In the second half, scoring goals came at a premium with neither team finding the back of the net in the first four and a half minutes.
But after being fouled and given a free-position shot, VanderMeulen had the first real opportunity for the Crimson to tie the game.
As soon as the whistle blew and play commenced, the lefty snapped a shot off that tied the match with 25:33 remaining.
Both teams charged back and forth from goal to goal with several missed opportunities by the Crimson to take the lead. With under 11 minutes to play, the score remained tied at 6-6.
But VanderMeulen was again fouled and given another free-position opportunity, this time with the chance to give Harvard its first lead of the game.
“Being down one and being tied, I knew that someone had to step up and put some shots away because we were having some troubles with their goalie,” VanderMeulen said. “A free position is a free chance to score; you have to try to capitalize on those. I know my team needed me to put it away.”
VanderMeulen did just that, finding the net with a bounce shot for her third goal of the day.
While Harvard tried to run out the clock, the Wildcats were on the attack the rest of the game trying to even the score—and with about two and a half minutes remaining, New Hampshire seemed poised to tie the game.
The Wildcats gained control of the ball in front of the Crimson net and fired a low shot that looked destined to be a goal only to be saved by Clark, who kept Harvard’s lead intact.
The Crimson gained possession and charged the ball up field, running out the clock with sharp passing, culminating in an empty-net goal by junior Tyler Petropulos with no time remaining, giving Harvard the 8-6 win.
“Apparently we are going to be in close games all this year,” Miller said. “That seems to [be our] M.O. It’s fun for the fans…[but] a little nerve-racking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard freshman Isabelle Clarke scored her first goal in a Crimson uniform with 7:41 remaining to tie the game, it appeared as if the Harvard women’s lacrosse team was poised to pull off a come-from-behind upset over No. 7 Virginia. But the Crimson’s comeback attempt would be in vain as Harvard fell to the Cavaliers, 19-18, yesterday afternoon at Harvard Stadium.
“We just came out kind of slow and fought back, but we just kind of ran out of time,” junior tri-captain Tyler Petropulos said. “It was a tough one to lose. We keep losing…the big games by one, so it can be frustrating, but at the same time, it’s really positive for the whole program in general, putting Harvard back on the map.”
Junior Jess Halpern scored the first goal of the game, giving the Crimson (4-4, 2-1 Ivy) an early 1-0 lead over Virginia (7-5, 0-4 ACC). Harvard and the Cavaliers traded goals back and forth, with the Crimson claiming a 3-2 lead. But with 19:57 remaining in the first half, Virginia sophomore Annie Thomas scored to knot the score at three.
It would be the last time Harvard would hold the lead.
In just over a minute, the Cavaliers scored four unanswered goals to gain a 7-3 edge.
“They’re very good in transition,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said. “They got out underneath us a couple of times…We’re just going to have to get better at that.”
A Harvard free-position goal by freshman Chelsey Newman with 8:05 remaining stopped the bleeding. But Virginia responded by scoring two in a row, giving the Cavaliers their largest lead so far in the game.
Virginia and the Crimson would each trade another goal to bring the score up to 10-5 with less than three minutes left to play. Harvard held off a strong offensive push to keep the Cavaliers’ lead at five at the half.
“We knew what we had to do [at halftime,]” Petropulos said. “It was just a matter of doing it.”
Less than two minutes into the second half, the Crimson came out of the locker room strong and quickly cut the lead to four off of VanderMuelen’s goal. After a big save by junior goalie Kerry Clark, the sophomore scored again on a free-position shot to bring the score to 10-7 with 26:08 to go in the game.
But Harvard would struggle to close the gap the rest of the half. Despite goals by Petropulos and Baskind, Virginia would net five more goals to claim its largest lead of the game at 15-9 with less than 15 minutes to go.
In the next five minutes, Halpern would score twice and VanderMuelen would net another, but the Cavaliers added two more to their tally to set the score at 17-12, keeping a five-goal lead with under 10 minutes to play.
But when the Crimson got a second wind, everything seemed to change.
In a little over two minutes, Harvard scored five goals, with Baskind, sophomore Nina Kucharczyk, Halpern, VanderMuelen, and Clarke all contributing to the tally. After trailing nearly all game, the Crimson and Virginia were tied, 17-17, with under eight minutes to go.
“We were doing a nice job of clearing space for each other,” Miller said. “I thought early on we threw some knuckleballs at their keeper…You just have to drop your shoulder and fire the ball at the college level.”
“It was a big team effort,” Tetropulos said. “I think everyone contributed today…You had [Isabelle] Clarke who came in, got some draw controls, [and] had that huge goal to tie the game. It was definitely a team effort, and it was just everyone working together. It was really motivational.”
But the run wouldn’t last.
Juniors Julie Gardner and Josie Owen scored two quick goals to gain the lead back for the Cavaliers.
With less than a minute in the game, Baskind scored to give Harvard some hope. But Virginia won the draw control, and the Crimson failed to regain possession as it ran out of time.
“We fought back, and we tied it up…I just thought we didn’t have a good handle on critical moments in the game,” Miller said. “We needed to either come up with a draw control or we needed a sustained possession.”
Halpern and VanderMuelen led the team with five goals apiece, and Clark recorded 10 saves on the afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 1, fashion-conscious students on campus gathered together in Adams House for the Harvard Vestis Council’s “Cocktails and Couture” in order to discuss problems prevalent in Harvard’s fashion community. Well-dressed representatives from Eleganza, Identities, and other groups participated in a fashion summit of sorts that, according to some, has been long overdue. “Cocktails and Couture” is just one of many ways that Vestis has sought to facilitate further dialogue about fashion on campus.
The Harvard Vestis Council was founded in 2005 by Chelsae I. Smith ’07, Kristen D. O’Neill ’06-’07, and Alexandra M. Tan ’06. In its first iteration, the Vestis Council’s primary mission was to showcase student designs in two annual shows: “Haute” and “Cocktails and Couture”. Gradually, however, there were fewer and fewer student designers, and the Vestis fashion shows began to suffer. “[Jane Chun ’12] and I made the decision to not do any Vestis fashion shows this year because the quality and quantity of student work available just wasn’t compelling enough to base an entire show on,” said Angela Su ’12, one of Vestis’s co-presidents. Instead, this year’s leadership opted to take Vestis in an entirely different direction—starting with the transformation of “Cocktails and Couture” into an intimate mixer that fosters conversation.
“Nothing like this has ever happened before on campus. We felt that it was time to have a very open and honest discussion within the community,” said Jane Chun ’12, the other co-president of Vestis. Ultimately, the Vestis Council aims to legitimize fashion as a pre-professional field of study, and provide students with the resources to pursue their passions. Vestis now works with Harvard’s Office of Career Services to foster a connection with local fashion retailers that students can later use to make their way in a notoriously difficult industry.
Vestis is also the fashion organization on campus that meets consistently all year. “There’s a definite need for a steady fashion group on campus. Other groups mainly build up to this one single event, and then disband,” said Ge “Andy” Zhang ’13, Vestis’s events director. “We want ‘Cocktails and Couture’ to become our hallmark and signature event in future years in order to maintain a connection with the other groups on campus,” he added.
Diversity is an important factor for Vestis, and is one of the reasons why the organization has been successful. “We bring people together from all walks of fashion … Jane and I had a hand in every other fashion organization on campus,” said Su. Each Vestis member also brings a different insight into fashion and its place in society. Most people consider the clothes that they shop for ‘fashion,’ but fashion itself is almost impossible to define. Fashion encompasses design, photography, modeling, and individual style among other things. In addition, fashion is in itself timeless. “Fashion reveals a window into history and culture. For instance, Franklin D. Roosevelt [’04] wore a Brooks Brothers cape to the meeting at Yalta, and Lincoln wore a Brooks Brothers topcoat to Ford’s Theatre on the night that he was assassinated,” Zhang said.
Interest in the Vestis Council has sharply increased within the last year, which is due in part to Vestis’s new fashion blog. Maintained by freshman Thomas Dai, the blog references fashion trends and events both on and off campus. “The internet started a huge revolution in the fashion industry. Emphasis on individual fashion trends was due in part to the fashion bloggers around the world. It just made sense for Vestis to have a blog of its own,” said Anna S. Ho ’11, former president of the Vestis Council.
After a night of champagne, hors d’œuvres, and laughter among colleagues, the Vestis Council’s immediate mission became apparent. “April is Harvard’s unofficial fashion month, so Vestis will be involved in almost every aspect of it,” said Su. The Harvard Vestis Council adds to the richness and diversity of interests on Harvard’s campus, and serves as a reminder that fashion—like other art forms—extends far beyond its medium.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stark contrast between the opulent, neoclassical architecture of the Cutler Majestic Theatre’s interior and its sleek, modern, and minimally decorated stage echoes the contrast between common interpretations of William Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice” and the radical new production directed by Darko Tresnjak. Tresnjak opts to change the setting from 14th-century Italy to the fast-paced world of modern-day Wall Street. The dramatic alteration of the play’s location allows for a unique, subtle, and tremendously effective rendition where heroes and villains are reversed, comedy surprisingly arises from most dramatic moments, and anti-Semetic undertones fade.
“The Merchant of Venice” primarily concerns a quarrel between a rich merchant Antonio (a chilling Tom Nelis) and the object of his prejudice, Jewish moneylender Shylock (a scene-stealing F. Murray Abraham). Shylock lends Antonio a large sum so that Antonio’s friend Bassanio (Lucas Hall) can travel to Belmont and woo his future wife Portia. Shylock, who hates Antonio for his anti-Semitism, demands that, if Antonio cannot repay his money, Shylock will be allowed to “remove a pound of flesh” from Antonio’s body, essentially killing him. Usually, productions of “The Merchant of Venice” portray Shylock as a foolish, villainous, and greedy Jewish man. In contrast, this production makes an unlikely hero of a very human Shylock.
F. Murray Abraham’s performance as Shylock is a tour de force that covers a complete spectrum of emotions. His Shylock is loving, vengeful, desperate, jealous, and hopeful; often times these emotions are subtly depicted in tandem. Abraham colors his character with a vast array of hand motions and vocal inflections that make him seem undeniably realistic. His performance is so far removed from the usual unsympathetic performances of Shylock that near the end of the play, when Shylock screams “take my life” in court and raises his arms as if on a crucifix, he begins to take on a mythological aura. The supporting performances are also uniformly outstanding. Kate MacCluggage’s sexy, confident, and aloof Portia, Ted Schneider’s idiotic, frat boy-like Gratiano, and Andrew Dahl’s strange yet hilarious Balthasar all hold their own even in Abraham’s company.
Tresnjak brings out the immense humanity of Abraham’s Shylock by setting the play in Wall Street and populating it with unsympathetic characters. Three MacBook Pros and three large plasma televisions displaying stock values lie on the sparsely decorated stage, as mechanical as are the play’s supporting characters. These characters, dressed in expensive investment-banker attire, are played with much less fervor and more emotional distance than Shylock. For instance, the opening scene introduces Antonio and Bassanio, supposed friends, having a conversation from opposite sides of the stage. The lighting supports this separation by enshrouding Bassanio in the only dark area on stage; it is as if he has no connection with Antonio at all. In contrast, none of Shylock’s interactions are distant. He is constantly in other characters’ faces, gesturing and shouting wildly.
To further this impersonal portrayal of Wall Street’s inhabitants, Tresnjak takes away the messengers in Shakespeare’s play and replaces them with dehumanizing cellphone conversations. Shylock is the only major character never to be seen with a cellphone. Even when interacting with members of lower social class, such as his servant Launcelot Gobbo—played to comedic perfection as a pothead by Jacob Ming-Trent—Shylock always speaks face-to-face.
Equally impressive is the symbolic use of color in lighting and costume design to further humanize Shylock. Every time a heinous act is committed against Shylock—the robbery of his house, his yarmulke being ripped off, his being kicked to the floor—the stage becomes doused in red light. Further, the two characters who play the largest role in Shylock’s demise, Portia and Antonio, are the only ones to wear hints of red. The symbolic meaning of the color is ultimately explained in a scene where Portia’s father, a dead king, speaks in a demonic voice to one of her suitors, repeatedly using the word “devil.” Here again the stage is doused in red. Shylock’s enemies are thus associated with evil, and Shylock himself with good.
While the show offers a variety of successes, it is Tresnjak’s skilled, subtle direction that stands out in the end. He so clearly reinforces Shylock’s true humanity that he achieves the near impossible: overriding centuries of interpretation and successfully changing the play’s meaning. At the end of the play when Shylock barks “I will have my bond” and forces himself onto Antonio, attempting to remove his owed pound of flesh, we do not fear for Antonio’s safety from the Jewish devil, as is often intended. Instead, we urge our hero on—his humanity has earned him justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of the Vietnam War, with "Tricky Dick" Nixon in the White House, 1100 members of the recently formed Graduate Student/Teaching Fellows Union closed down Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences for a day—March 28, 1972. The tutors and Teaching Fellows picketed, the students in solidarity stayed away, and some faculty sympathetically held classes off campus. The Crimson published editorials in favor of the Union and gave our leaders space to explain their causes.
The anti-labor legislation starting in Wisconsin, the recent pro-labor rallies at the Massachusetts State House, which I attended with friends in full voice, and the “We Are One” movement mobilizing around the nation on April 4 suddenly make all issues of unionization and workers' rights today's top issues.
In that sense, what causes people to fight back?
The bitter immediate cause for busy Teaching Fellows in the 1970s was a cut in a major part of our compensation. The University unilaterally decided to rescind $1,000 in tuition remission. The top salary was $3,200 a year, so we were going to suffer a humiliating 35 percent cut in pay and be charged tuition for a third year when we no longer took courses. To add extra bitterness, the University simultaneously announced a move instituting "need-based" fellowships that would consider spouse and parental assets in determining need. We "Officers," as we were still called—whose teaching in sections, tutorials, and seminars saved Harvard 313 full-time faculty salaries—were going to be forced into embarrassing dependency on our families. The administration argued that we were mostly middle class and could pay. The new Union pointed out that parents who earned as little as $7,000 would be asked to contribute to their adult offspring.
FAS needed more low-paid teachers, as the 1970s were the years in which the College, wanting to add more undergraduate women to improve its gender ratio, grew rapidly. FAS could in theory have eliminated sections and tutorials, but those were necessary elements in a College whose students complained about the size of their classes and their distance from the elite research faculty. $1 million was at stake, which was real money in 1972. Foundations and the government were cutting grants for graduate education. Without our million dollars, the FAS said it would have a deficit.
It was soon to be the moment—1974—when the University decided to move from a conservative investment strategy toward a riskier one, overseen by the establishment of the Harvard Management Company with the same sort of aggressiveness that led to the recent stunning billion-dollar losses from the endowment.
One hundred-fifty of us turned up at the meeting on March 13 where the Dean of GSAS announced this. That night we decided to form a union. We organized all the departments. People came together; some later became major scholars—Mahmood Mamdani, Theda Skocpol, Mike Ferber, and Frank Ackerman to name a few. I was a tutor in History and Literature, and although I had a full foundation fellowship (and so was financially unaffected by the changes) and a four-year-old child and a thesis to write, I was moved by the injustice. I became a fervent drudge of an organizer and a press liaison. We had great posters, cartoons, and persuasive rhetoric.
To us in the Union, Harvard's attitude was a lesson in bad labor-management relations, and the irony was not lost on us that this struggle took place under two lawyers who were labor experts, Derek Bok, then the president of Harvard, and John Dunlop, then Dean of the Faculty. In two weeks, the Union transformed us from isolated and detached individuals into a collective of intellectual laborers and junior colleagues–the "Officers" of the University that our ID cards called us.
But Dean Dunlop said a commission should study the issues and report back. The other grad students put down their picket signs as he knew they would. I was on that futile Commission–one of six student members. John Rawls, fresh from having published “A Theory of Justice,” was on it. Only later did he tell a Union member privately: "The students’ cause is just." Before we could make more than one recommendation, however, the administration made the first of those decisions I’ve described, which resulted in the weakening of the power of the faculty in governance issues.
Teaching Fellows still have similar gripes against administrations, although they are future colleagues who ought to be treated with respect. Our experience then might be a lesson—not to lose in committee, not to give up. There are still many vibrant TF unions on campuses around the nation.
What is still perfectly clear is the solidarity that the TFs, the graduate students, the undergraduates, and some faculty all shared. Thinking about all this, the old indignation and fever for justice rush back—the resentment at hypocrisy, the contempt for careless power, and the exultation of belonging to a collective organization with shared values. Maybe such motives will send Americans into the streets now, in a national time of crisis for labor organizing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Greetings, future member of the Class of 2015.
Let’s talk—I hear you’re considering Harvard. We all know it gets a bad rap in the social life department, but if you want the real deal before you make a decision, forget what you’ve heard. I’ll tell you a few things you need to know. But don’t flatter yourself, future ’15er, I’m not doing this just for you. I hope that this will also help current students speak with more specificity and insight about the things they like or don’t about Harvard. After all, you’re showing up on campus in two weeks and every Harvard student owes it to you to provide the 411 on life in the 02138.
First, the administration’s increasingly aggressive attempts to eliminate venues for underage drinking are robbing students of critical social outlets. Students cannot ask the University to condone or fund underage drinking, but from cancelling “golf” in Pforzheimer House to banning hard liquor served at off-campus House formals, the administration impairs House Committee programming without helping HoCos recoup the community lost as a result of these restrictions. In four years, I have not seen an effective or widely enjoyed program emerge from the Office of Student Life to replace programs and traditions that are disbanded. It is no surprise that students have turned away from the administration in search of social fulfillment.
Also, the lack of University-sponsored social programming is especially problematic for freshman males. One effect of the University’s crackdown on underage drinking is a growing inability of University programming to compete with final clubs. For all the (warranted) discussion about the impact of male-dominated social spaces on females, little attention is paid to the effects of this phenomenon on non-member males. Freshman males are often barred from entering, and so nights consist of wandering from one soon-to-be-shut-down room party to another. The final clubs can thus begin to acquire an importance of epic proportion in the minds of freshman males, seen by many as the ultimate antidote to nomadic nights of wandering. Every year the administration fails to provide social options for freshmen, they strengthen the appeal of the final club system.
You should also know that not all final clubs are created equal. Some clubs do more harm than others and are enclaves of sexual predation, objectification of females, and homophobia. Others are more responsible, less exclusive, and undeniably safer social spaces. The administration and groups like OSAPR and UHS should work together to evaluate the clubs individually.  As someone who stands fully behind the policies and procedures of my organization, the Fox Club, I see this as a way both to exonerate the clubs that are exemplary as well as hold accountable the organizations that do less to protect party-goers. Without being publicly scrutinized, these organizations have little incentive to work toward reform.
But, nevertheless, the decision to join a social group can define your social experience at this school. Upon admission, members of final clubs, sororities, and other societies enter a veritable wonderland of parties, mixers, open bars, and cocktail attire that makes freshman year seem like a bad dream. So, pre-frosh, if you have the option to join a final club, a sorority, a fraternity, or another organization with a strong social component (The Crimson, The Advocate, and The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, come to mind) I urge you not to turn the offer down. For many of us, membership in a social organization has been the largest contributor to our social satisfaction.
Therein lies a major reason why final club critics often fail to engage in meaningful dialogue with club members. Most members do not deny the inherent unfairness and arbitrariness of the system, and for years, I have struggled with persistent guilt about final club members’ embarrassment of riches. Nor do I deny the fact that some clubs are unwilling to confront the ways in which their policies and cultures allow for truly harmful behavior. Still, attacks on the very existence of the clubs as social organizations fail to resonate with members. From without, these organizations may appear one-dimensional and distasteful, but from within, they also represent friendship, camaraderie, belonging, and social fulfillment at a school where it can be hard to find those things. So, pre-frosh, if you take flak for joining a social organization that you love and cherish, brush it off as many of us final clubbers learn to do. Suggest that critics work to build alternatives and confront specific practices instead of attempting to discredit and dismantle entire organizations that form the foundation of hundreds of students’ college experiences.
So there you have it.
A few things to consider as you decide whether Harvard is the place for you. While I am a self-confessed Harvard booster who believes that this is an incredibly fulfilling place academically and socially, I acknowledge that the feeling is not universal and that there are serious challenges associated with social life at Harvard. This place can be both fantastic and endlessly frustrating. But current students owe it to you, our future classmate, and to ourselves to be able to speak honestly and openly about the problems we face. When you come to campus in two weeks, don’t be shy. Ask about these things and demand details. Let’s call it your first homework assignment as a Harvard student in the Class of 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Obama fans rejoice! With Japan struggling to manage one of the world’s worst nuclear disasters in recent memory and Libya still torn apart by destructive forces from both Moammar Gaddafi and the opposition rebel army, President Barack H. Obama has at least one reason to smile: He’s around 88 percent. While that metric may not be his approval rating—which lingers at a tepid 40 percent after a general downward trend—Obama’s NCAA March Madness tournament bracket currently ranks in the 87.8th percentile as of Saturday’s semifinals.
To some, the inclusion of analysis of a college basketball tournament on a presidential agenda may seem incongruous compared to the urgent international crises also on his docket. Certain caustic critics attack his ESPN appearance to present his bracket as insensitive and unconstructive, neglecting to mention that Obama utilized the television appearance to implore the public to help Japan relief efforts. To these skeptical, irritated evaluators, I ask: Would another press conference have been more effective? A brief television appearance does not detract from Obama’s commitment to his presidential duties, especially as the White House has been consistently active on reshaping plans on how to best address situations in Libya and Japan. Given the fact that the international crises have not gone untended, Obama deserves the right to pursue his leisurely pastimes—meaning the study, analysis, and successful construction of his bracket—without public revulsion.
Understandably, the main reason the critics express such outrage over Obama’s surprisingly successful bracket seems to be that it projects an image of disinterest and inactivity towards more critical matters. Even so, the United States has consistently provided support in numerous ways for nations in need such as Japan and Libya, revising the form of aid or best approach. In the ESPN segment which has come under attack, Obama opens the four-minute blurb with heartfelt plug for Japan. As a result, because of similar efforts, the United States has shown its tireless support in other ways, including sending  robots to Japan. With regard to Libya, Obama recently defended American-led military assault, citing it as a matter of “national interest.” Whether or not one agrees with his policies or approach, the fact that Obama has treated the international crises with fervent attention and care in accordance with his political and moral beliefs is undeniable.
True, public acceptance of Obama’s NCAA bracketing centers around a simple truth: Presidents are people, too. Before Obama expressed his ardent passion for college basketball by publically releasing a bracket for the third year in a row, presidential pastimes trace back to Nixon with his bowling and even George Washington and his love of brewing beer. It is absurd to think that he should place all frivolous activities on hold whenever a global crisis emerges. Denying Obama the chance to pursue to follow college basketball while students around the nation take several five-minute breaks to watch YouTube videos presents a ridiculous double standard. Granted, the delicate combination of diplomacy and military action required to mend relations in the Middle East does not compare to my Expos paper on Impressionist art, but Obama and I would both benefit from a break to recharge the brain.
So stop condemning Obama for being human in the least harmful way imaginable. In an age when the government seems so distanced from the American people—think back to the last time you spoke to your local representative—knowing that the commander in chief of the United   States kindles a love for basketball is somewhat charming. If he can balance international affairs, wrestle with the economy, and still pick an alarmingly accurate first round, then play on, sir, play on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, at an event co-sponsored by The Women’s Center, the sorority Delta Gamma, and the all-female social organization The Seneca, Inc., students discussed whether Harvard should officially recognize single-sex organizations in order to help correct the “slanted power dynamic” between male and female social organizations on campus. Although such a change may be a reasonable short-term solution to the perennial problem of gendered social space on campus, it would do little to address that problem’s real cause,  which is, of course, the drinking age. Indeed, because one must be 21 to drink legally, the only places on campus underage students can currently drink without fear of administrative action tend to be final clubs or other social organizations that discriminate on the basis of gender or other factors. We acknowledge that the College cannot be asked to ignore the legal drinking age. Still, at this point, addressing the issue of gendered social space means enforcing a far less rigid alcohol policy than it currently does.
In this debate over social space, it seems relatively easy to get distracted by the question of single-sex organizations and their intrinsic value. Of course, given that last week’s event was hosted by three women’s groups, there are many that maintain that all-female social organizations offer many benefits to their members and would conceivably would have an even greater effect if officially recognized. And there are others—like The Crimson Staff—that maintain that any single-sex organization inevitably reinforces the gender segregation that already permeates the Harvard social scene. That, however, is another discussion altogether.
In other words, the real issue here is alcohol, the de facto currency that governs collegiate social life, and who exactly has access to that currency.
Assuming that the term “male-dominated social scene” generally refers to the significant social cache held by the all-male final clubs, the problem of gendered social space is more nuanced than simply a matter of official recognition from the University. Although to most current undergraduates it may seem that final clubs have always been a seminal part of Harvard social life, their status has in fact fluctuated over time and has only (relatively) recently enjoyed a resurgence in prominence. Why? Although the resurgence might be attributable to a culture shift, we feel confident in speculating that final clubs have become even larger fixtures in Harvard social life merely because after 1984, when the drinking age was raised from 18 to 21, they became the only outlets in the campus vicinity where un-policed drinking could still occur. In terms of social space, then, these exclusive, single-sex social organizations are not popular among students just because they own large Mt. Auburn Street mansions but also because those mansions are not subject to 2 a.m. shutdowns, administrative interventions, or “must be 21 to drink” signs.
In that sense, it is difficult to see how expanding official recognition to single-sex organizations would be greatly beneficial to Harvard’s social scene in any concrete way.
The irony, of course, is that the administration of a College so nominally committed to non-discrimination only encourages the popularity of these gender-exclusive spaces by cracking down on the all-inclusive campus social events that occur routinely in the Houses. Take for instance the recent shut-down of Pforzheimer House “golf” and the prohibition of House Councils from serving hard liquor at House formals. In many Houses, the weekly Stein Clubs are already closely monitored, reducing the incentive for underage House residents to attend. The strictness of these policies drives many students from these types of events into a social environment of gender segregation in which disciplinary action for having a drink is an unlikely possibility.
Of course, the College is bound by the laws of the state of Massachusetts and is legally in an unambiguous position with regard to underage drinking. But does the College’s eternal fear of liability truly justify what seems to be a tacit approval of a gender-divided social environment?
After all, Universities across the country all face similar legal responsibilities and choose to deal with underage drinking in a variety of different ways. In the name of committing itself in theory and in practice to the non-discrimination policy it so proudly promotes, we call on the College administration to consider the role it plays in facilitating a male-empowered social dynamic on campus that is an anachronism of a Harvard better forgotten than emulated.

It’s not every day that a college team gets to play a country’s national team, but the Harvard men’s soccer squad will have a chance to play against a competitive international opponent while supporting a great cause.
The Haiti national soccer team, ranked 99th in the world out of 202 FIFA teams, is traveling on a five-day tour through the Northeast to help raise money for relief efforts in the country. Harvard and Haiti are working with Partners in Health to help Haiti rebuild after the devastating 7.0 M earthquake on Jan. 12, 2010. Though new crises have struck the world, the Caribbean nation is still in a reconstruction phase one year later.
The earthquake had lasting effects for the squad; during 2010, the Haitians lost 30 people close to the soccer team. Even so, the Haitian team looks to build its soccer program back to its glory almost 40 years ago, qualifying for the World Cup in 1974.
The Crimson (5-7-5, 2-3-2 Ivy) finished the season under .500, but the game will be a good exhibition for the returning players before season play picks up next fall.
The match will take place on April 10 at 5 p.m. at Harvard Stadium. It is part of a series of games against the Ivy League, as the national team will have played Dartmouth on Friday. Tickets will be $10 for the general public and free to undergraduates, but donations will be accepted. All should attend to watch high-caliber soccer while supporting the Haitians and their recuperation efforts. For those who cannot make it, there will be live video stream online.
See the YouTube video for a preview of the match. It's interesting to note that graduated Crimson forward Andre Akpan '10 is featured on the game's poster—hopefully, the Haiti national team's game plan does not involve having to account for the Colorado Rapids forward's prolific scoring.

Two Harvard undergraduates were awarded the prestigious Harry S. Truman Scholarship, a public service award that recognizes the work of approximately one college junior from each of the fifty states who has demonstrated a strong commitment to leadership and public service.
Anthony C. Hernandez ’12 and Niharika S. Jain ’12 were among the 60 winners announced last week by the Truman Foundation out of an original 602 applicants. They will each receive $30,000 to be used towards tuition at a graduate school of their choosing.
The scholarship was awarded based on “leadership potential” and “likelihood of ‘making a difference’ in public service” after an intensive application process that included an in-house competition for Harvard’s four coveted nominations, three letters of recommendation, personal essays, and multiple rounds of interviews.
“I felt like I was taking a sixth class in the fall. It’s a big time commitment,” Jain said.
“It made me think a lot about my future goals and plans,” she added.
Both Jain and Hernandez have strong interests in education policy. Hernandez said education has always been a big part of his life.
“My mom was a teacher. My biggest role models growing up were teachers,” Hernandez said. “I really do believe in the power of education, and I always knew I wanted to go into public policy.”
Hernandez said a course he took at Harvard—Government 1368: The Politics of American Education—inspired him to pursue American education policy.
“My interests snowballed from there,” he said. “I worked at a Minneapolis charter school last summer and I will be student-teaching at a Cambridge public school in the fall.”
Jain said she has always known that she was going to go into public policy.
“My parents instilled in me a value for public service at a very young age,” she said. “I’m really interested in addressing inequalities in education in America. I’m also interested in social entrepreneurship. My plans for the future involve both of these ideas.”
Both students submitted policy proposals highlighting improvements that could be made in their areas of their interest.
“My policy proposal advocated for mayor control for the Minneapolis public school system,” Hernandez said.
Jain proposed that the Department of Education do more work on combatting the commercial sexual exploitation of children.
Upon completion of graduate school, both Truman Scholars will be required to work for at least three years in public service.
Jain reflected on the experience as both humbling and enjoyable.
“I met so many amazing people,” she said. “It was really a great experience and I’m lucky to have been a part of it.”
“I’m ecstatic about this award,” Hernandez added. “I’m just super-excited to have been chosen.”

Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors water bottles have taken the campus by storm thanks to the National Alcohol Screening Day that took place on Friday.
The event, organized by DAPA, aimed to raise awareness about alcohol consumption on campus.
In order to receive a water bottle, students filled out a questionnaire about their alcohol use and then met with a consultant about their responses.
The conversations were conducted in private, and the results of the survey were anonymous.
After speaking with the consultants about safe alcohol consumption for a few minutes, participants received a DAPA CamelBak water bottle.
“The water bottles are obviously a huge draw,” said Ryan Travia, director of alcohol & other drug services for Harvard University Health Services. “But in my mind it’s about whatever works just to get students in the door.”
Getting students in the door is exactly what happened.
Travia estimated that between 1,500 and 1,600 people filed through the fourth floor of the Malkin Athletic Center.
Student turnout was so high that DAPA ran out of water bottles a full hour before the end of the event.
Last year, Harvard’s alcohol screening event saw the highest turnout of any screening event in the country with over 1,330 students in attendance, according to Travia.
“We had high expectations coming in [this year], and I think we exceeded those expectations,” said Chair of DAPA’s Events Committee Daniel E. Minamide ’12.
Although the national screening day is about advocating responsible drinking, many of the students who attend the event are either non-drinkers or low-risk drinkers, Travia said.
Sometimes these students are simply lured in by the free water bottles, but students can use the opportunity to get advice about a friend or family member who has problems with alcohol, Travia said.
The consultants give tips and strategies of how to handle situations, and they make students aware of resources available.
This increase in alcohol awareness, Travia said, helps explain the increases in the number of students admitted to UHS for alcohol consumption this year.
Harvard’s amnesty policy also seems to correlate with the rise in UHS visits. The amnesty policy allows students to take intoxicated friends to UHS without facing disciplinary repercussions from the College.
“I think, if anything, [the increased UHS visits] is not a negative,” Minamide said. “That’s people being more aware around campus of what they can do and of what they should be looking for when people are out drinking.”

The controversial Social Transformation Conference—aimed at promoting “faith-based social transformation efforts,” according to its website—took place in the Northwest Science Building this weekend as a group of protestors rallied outside to criticize alleged homophobic and Islamophobic remarks made by two of the conference’s key speakers.
The two-day event—hosted by the Harvard Extension Service and Leadership Society—examined the incorporation of religious principles in societal reform, featuring panel discussions and speeches from numerous faith-based leaders.
Gay rights groups criticized the conference for the inclusion of speakers Os Hillman, a prominent Christian business leader, and Lance Wallnau, an expert in personal and organizational transformation, pointing to inflammatory remarks they have made in the past. On Friday evening, approximately 20 activists gathered outside the building to protest the event, and more joined them on Saturday.
“They’re trying to infiltrate Harvard and bring on the next level of Christendom,” said Sierra E. Fleenor, a Harvard Divinity School student and one of the organizers of the protest. “The message is hateful. It sets Christians as if there’s a homogeneous group called a ‘Christian group’ against Muslims, against gay people, and I think that that silences everyone who’s not that brand of Christian.”
Harvard College Queer Students and Allies Political Committee Chair Samuel J. Bakkila ’11-’12, who participated in the protest, said he felt the conference promoted “homophobia and hatred.”
“It does not send the message, to students and especially to incoming freshmen that were just admitted, that Harvard will be a safe space for them,” he added.
“If I had my way, Harvard wouldn’t welcome people like this here,” Fleenor said.
Conference attendees expressed a different perspective on the event.
“I think the purpose of this conference is to give perspective of ... God’s heart, that He wants to make things better in culture and make things better in general and that He loves people so His plan for them is good,” said Charis H. Brown, Hillman’s daughter.
One focus of the conference was on Harvard’s 1692 motto: “Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae”—translated from Latin as “Truth for Christ and the Church”—in juxtaposition with the current perceived lack of spirituality at Harvard.
“If Harvard’s original purpose was that, then we want to help bring that framework to society,” Brown said. “I think we’re trying to bring that true disposition of Jesus into the world.”
Brown added that she disagreed with many of the claims made against her father.
“I don’t personally believe my dad wants to do harm to anybody,” she said. “He doesn’t hate gays and he doesn’t hate Muslims.”
Robert L. Wing, a volunteer at the event, said he supported the idea of a faith-based society.
“We’d just like to see a restoration, not only of Harvard, but every school, that would mix faith, relationship with God, with a way that we conduct ourselves,” he said.
Conference attendee Kobi A. Rex ’14 said he was interested in the topics of the conference.
“[Wallnau] is a powerful speaker, so I’m excited to hear what he has to say,” he added.
Some protesters attempted to enter the conference on Friday evening.
“We were just going to sit with our signs; just sit and listen to what’s going on,” said former QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11.
But they were escorted back out into the drizzling rain by Harvard University police officers.

Senator Charles “Chuck” E. Schumer ’71 said the Democratic Party must help restore the public’s faith in the “American Dream” during a talk in the Kirkland Junior Common Room on Friday.
“The goal ought to be to have the American Dream alive again,” Schumer said.
The Democrats need to convince the middle class that they are working on its behalf, he said.
The event—which filled the JCR—was organized by Kirkland House and the Harvard College Democrats.
His remarks spanned a range of topics, including his thoughts on the economy and his time at Harvard.
Speaking about the state of the economy, Schumer described the country as “a big strong giant with a cake moustache.” He said that while the U.S. has the capacity to out-produce other nations, it is currently riddled by overconsumption.
“[We need to] resume being the production giant rather than the consumption giant,” he said.
The senator, who received both his A.B. from Harvard College and J.D. from Harvard Law School, also talked to the audience about his experiences at Harvard, including his initial worries about being able to fit in at a time when the majority of Harvard students came from private schools.
“When I went to Harvard everyone was either from very wealthy suburbs or from university towns,” Schumer, who was brought up in Brooklyn, told students in the audience.
President of the Harvard Young Democrats as a student at the College, he described how he first became involved in politics at Harvard. He said his interest in politics led him to change his concentration from chemistry  to government.
“It’s where people and ideas meet,” he said, explaining why politics appealed to him. “I realized I was much more of a people person.”
He also talked about his career path in answer to an audience question on what inspired him to run for elected office, advising students to “do what you love.”
“When I graduated so many people wanted to run for office,” Schumer said, expressing his pleasure at the current pattern of students becoming involved increasingly with programs like Teach for American after graduation.
Audience member S. Susan Zhu ’11, said that the Senator was able to relate to students and was “very down to earth.”
“Having worked in the Senate, I know that they’re not always able to interact with students. Some of them aren’t the most comfortable around the younger generation. I thought he did a great job,” Zhu said.
“It went really well,” said Nicholas R. Perkons ’14, adding that the senator was “very articulate.”

With a razor blade resting on her tongue, Debbie Moccia threatened Associate Justice John “Jack” T. Lu’s court that she would commit suicide by swallowing the blade unless sent to a state hospital instead of prison.
It was the second time Moccia, who is a Level 3 sex offender and trans-identified, had smuggled a blade into a courtroom by hiding it in her mouth.
Local press reports describe the situation as tense and potentially dangerous to individuals in the court as Moccia, with a long criminal record, proceeded to try and negotiate her way out of jail. Lu, however, was able to avoid a tragic ending that day.
“Lu calmly but firmly told her that he was willing to listen to her but that first, she had to spit out the blade,” the Gloucester Times reported in January.
Lu is set to preside over the trial of Jabrai Jordan Copney—the alleged gunman in the May 2009 Kirkland shooting—which is slated to begin today in Middlesex Superior Court. Interviews and a review of cases that have passed through Lu’s courtroom indicate a man with a calm control of his courtroom, someone who can move through his docket—and even end the occasional tense stand-off.
“He’s been in the county for a while and he’s very serious and conscientious,” Superior Court Judge David Lowy said of Lu.
Although the official trial—which, according to prosecutors and the defense, will likely last two to three weeks—starts today, pre-trial hearings have been ongoing since July of 2009.
Lu was appointed to the trial after the original judge—Superior Court Judge Wendy Gershengorn—retired mid-trial.
As a member of the Massachusetts Superior Court, Lu presides over a variety of cases—ranging from parental kidnapping to the legality of a neighborhood fence—but Copney’s is not the first murder trial that he has overseen.
In 2008, he presided over the case of Jeremias Bins, who was accused of beating his wife and stepson to death with a hammer.
Bins was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and ordered to serve two consecutive life sentences.
At the time, Gerard T. Leone ’85, the District Attorney currently involved in the Kirkland case, praised the ruling of Lu and the jury.
“We thank the jury for rendering this just verdict and speaking for [the wife], [the son] and their family,” Leone said to the Metro West Daily News in 2008.
Recently, Lu heard the case of a Salem woman who is charged with the attempted murder of her autistic son.
Kristen A. LaBrie allegedly withheld medication from her cancer-stricken nine-year-old son, who died in March of 2009.
LaBrie’s trial is also slated to start this month.
Attorney Randy S. Chapman, who served as one of the defense lawyers for a hearing under Lu, referred to him as “extraordinarily fair.”
“He’s very patient and soft spoken,” Chapman continued. “He allows the lawyers to try the case but will control the pace of it.”
Before becoming a judge, Lu served as both a trial lawyer with a private practice and as a Massachusetts public defender, specializing in, among other practices, felonies and drug crimes, according to an online database of lawyers and judges run by LexisNexis.
As a trial lawyer, he worked on several double murder cases.
Lu served as a justice of the Boston Municipal Court—a general jurisdiction trial court—from 2001 to 2006. In 2006, the governor appointed Lu to the Massachusetts Superior Court.
Lu graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1981 and from Boston University School of Law in 1984. He is currently an adjunct professor of law at the New England School of Law.
He is a member of the Asian American Lawyers Association.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Columbia University advisory board passed a resolution on Friday advancing the process of welcoming the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps back to Columbia after more than 40 years, following in the footsteps of Harvard’s recognition of ROTC last month.
But the greater transparency of Columbia’s process has raised concern among students and faculty about the way in which Harvard recognized ROTC.
The Columbia University Senate—a university-wide legislative body made up of students, faculty, and staff which informs administration policy-making—voted 51-17, with one abstention, to approve a resolution on ROTC.
The resolution paves the way for ROTC recognition at Columbia, stating: “be it further resolved that Columbia University welcomes the opportunity to explore mutually beneficial relationships with the Armed Forces of the United States, including participation in the programs of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.”
The resolution does not ensure that ROTC will be formally recognized or that the military will be invited to establish a unit on campus. Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger and other administrators would be required to negotiate the terms with the Department of Defense for a military presence to be established on campus.
Harvard was the first major University to recognize ROTC following the December repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the military policy which banned gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military.
Since Harvard’s recognition of Naval ROTC on March 4, many have said that the University’s move will influence other institutions to follow.
Harvard Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen said at the signing ceremony that he believed that Harvard’s recognition is “likely to have a ripple effect across the nation.”
While Harvard has been praised for leading the way in welcoming the military, some students and faculty have criticized the lack of transparency and community involvement in the process in comparison to Columbia’s handling of ROTC.
According to the Columbia Spectator, the University Senate created a Task Force on Military Engagement and hosted meetings and town halls, inviting students and faculty to debate the issue.
Prior to the Columbia Senate’s decision, neuroscience professor John E. Dowling ’57 expressed concern in March that Harvard’s decision to recognize ROTC was made without any faculty-wide discussion. He said at the time that he hopes that the administration will consult the Faculty in the case that military classes are introduced into the curriculum.
“Maybe the president feels she doesn’t need to discuss this with the Faculty,” he said.
Harvard trans and intersex rights activists said that, while they do not agree with the Columbia Senate’s decision, they appreciate Columbia’s approach, adding that a similar process at Harvard would have allowed them greater opportunity to voice their worry that the military violates Harvard’s non-discrimination policy.
“I appreciate the Columbia process much more,” said Trans Task Force leader Jia Hui Lee ’12. “It gave a lot more space for discussion and it allowed people to raise their concerns about this issue.”
Citing the military’s exclusion of trans and intersex individuals from service, a contingent of students and faculty members have criticized the University’s recognition of ROTC, claiming that it violates Harvard’s non-discrimination policy.
Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11 said he is “deeply concerned” about the lack of student and faculty participation in the University’s decision to recognize ROTC.
“Anyone who’s concerned about transparency or democratic decision making should be concerned about the way Harvard made its decision on this issue,” Chan said.
Lee added that Yale has also initiated a more transparent process, forming a faculty committee last Monday to assess the return of ROTC.
But Michael M. Segal ’76, a member of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC, wrote in an email that Columbia needs broad faculty and student support because Columbia may be compelled to establish an on-campus NROTC unit. Unlike Harvard, where students can participate in NROTC at nearby MIT, NROTC is not available elsewhere in Manhattan.
Segal added that “Columbia had the more radical reputation from 1969, and that a formal vote was important to overcome this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students spilled out into the halls of the Office of Career Services building to listen to panelists answer questions about the culture and work environment in China—which some described as competitive and reliant on networking.
At the OCS-hosted discussion Friday afternoon, representatives from McKinsey & Company, Johnson & Johnson, D.E. Shaw Group, and HSBC talked about their experiences working in China.
“Corporate China is much more cut-throat,” said Mike Chan, a Harvard Business School student who described his experiences with the corporate culture in China as more political than in the United States.
While the panel discussion was geared towards corporate occupations, many panelists said their advice was applicable to other fields in China.
Panelists emphasized the importance of developing interpersonal relationships with co-workers while developing a career in China, which they said can be especially challenging for students who are not from China and who have not immersed themselves in the culture.
“Connections and who you know is how the work gets done, so it’s much more difficult for a foreigner to break in,” said Lusi Fang, who is a student at the Harvard Kennedy School and has worked at HSBC in China.
Adding to the difficulties for foreigners to break into Chinese firms, home-grown Chinese university graduates continue to flow into the labor force.
“Yet, the Chinese educational system still has troubles. It doesn’t produce the type of creativity and innovation
that Western universities are still generating,” said Jevan Soo, a student at the Kennedy School and at Harvard Business School who has worked at McKinsey & Company.
Students working in China will also have a chance to witness a quickly changing economy, panelists said.
“Any given year you choose to go, it will be very interesting. This island near Shanghai was inhabited by goats,” Suri said. “Six months later, they had 22,000 workers building large dry docks on that same island.”
Despite the challenges that foreigners face in China, the panelists said success was possible as long as one put in the work. They also said that although some people initially get paid at a lower rate than they would in the United States, the hands-on experiences that one gets in China are often more engaging than those in the U.S.
Soo encouraged students at Harvard to make use of all the resources that are offered, such as fellowships and traveling grants for research in China. Panelists added that students and graduates should also take advantage of the Harvard Club and its network, especially the small Harvard community in China.
Attendee Xiaojing Yang ’14 said that the panel “relieves some fears of trying to work in China. And seeing people that didn’t have a strong background in China was comforting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted unanimously to endorse Eventplease—a new website that provides a potential alternative to the current Harvard Online Events Calendar—at its general meeting last night.
In contrast to the catch-all Harvard Events Calendar, Eventplease will allow student groups to create profiles and post events that may be more directly applicable to the undergraduate population.
“We find that many of the events posted on the current Events Calendar are irrelevant, which has caused a lot of students to stop using the site,” said Alisha D. Ramos ’12, co-creator of Eventplease. “We wanted to create a solution to that and create something more useful.”
According to the UC legislation, the new website will improve upon the current Online Events Calendar in a variety of ways—namely by offering iCal, Google Calendar, and Facebook integration, as well as event tracking and a unified interface to showcase all Harvard events.
In addition, the website will be able to suggest events that might appeal to individual users, allowing for a more personalized experience.
“It can be thought of as the Pandora of events,” said Michael B. Wong ’12, lead creator of Eventplease. “Different people have different tastes, and we want to accommodate that.”
Wong, who created the website with his three close friends, said they touched base with the UC during the Hack Harvard event in January, and the UC subsequently agreed to help publicize the site.
Wong and his friends’ creation was the only project entered in Hack Harvard that was not created as a requirement for Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science.” According to Eventplease creators, this has proven to be an advantage in the long run.
“The site wasn’t created as a CS50 project, so we weren’t working under the mentality that we had to get this done in two weeks,” Wong said. “Instead, it has become a work in progress and we are constantly open to new ideas and suggestions.”
Council members stressed the important role publicity will play in the success of the website.
“Something like this requires a lot of strong advertisement in the beginning to create an initial user base,” UC Secretary Michael C. George ’14 said. “Once we launch the website and get it off the ground, we need to give student groups an incentive to post events.”
According to Wong, they will initially launch the site by posting a variety of events, but he then hopes that student groups will begin claiming or creating their own profiles on the site so they can advertise their own events.
“In order to get this off the ground we need the UC’s help,” Wong said. “After that I hope that it becomes automated and self-perpetuating.”

Service Employees International Union, the union that includes many Harvard janitors and security guards, officially launched its contract campaign for Harvard security workers on Saturday with a gathering in the Science Center.
The event—which was attended by union members and students as well local supporters—included a variety of speeches stressing the importance of the union during the coming negotiations.
Speakers told the audience that SEIU was not afraid to fight Harvard in order to achieve their goals. They also stressed the importance of unions to the Harvard community.
“You make Harvard Harvard,” said Cambridge City Councilor Leland Cheung, a student at Harvard Kennedy School. “The City Council stands with you,” he added.
Karen A. Narefsky ’11, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, emphasized that it was essential that SEIU members attain a fair contract. Speaking in English and Spanish, she told the audience members that they have the support of the Harvard student community.
“We are behind you 100 percent,” Narefsky said. “We are calling on Harvard to provide jobs that are just and sustainable.”
Speakers also stressed the need for unity, both within SEIU and among workers outside of the union.
“If we are not united, we lose,” said Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for SEIU Local 615.
The audience responded enthusiastically to many of the speakers, breaking out into applause and chanting, “When we fight, we win!”
Narefsky said she considered unity to be the primary theme of the event.
“The message was linking the struggles that are happening here to struggles that are going on a national level,” she said.
Organizers of the event said they thought it was a good kickoff to the campaign, but were focused on the difficult negotiations ahead.
“We think that the University has the resources and furthermore the obligation to provide us with a fair contract,” Langley said. “As a non-profit, Harvard should be a leader in [fair] labor relations.”
But Langley said he is not looking for a battle.
“I think we should try and work out our differences,” he said. “To fight does not serve anybody’s best interest.”
Following the union meeting, many attendees of the rally marched in solidarity with employees of The Upper Crust Pizzeria.
The Upper Crust is currently facing allegations that the pizza chain violated labor laws by demanding repayment of back wages, paying workers less than the minimum wage, and firing workers unfairly.

Showing slides of a snake expanding its body as it gulps down an egg five times as large as its head, biology professor Farish A. Jenkins Jr. demonstrated Friday the benefits of using specimens in his Organic and Evolutionary Biology classes.
In the third and final conversation on teaching and learning—a principle that Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith has set as a priority—Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds led a panel discussion on the importance of using collections to teach.
Jenkins considered the collections that he used “essential to his classes.”
“Although I know some of my colleagues from the [Harvard University Office of] General Counsel might see this picture and say it screams ‘liability,’” said Jenkins, who paced energetically as he pointed to the projected picture of a College senior holding a lethal snake.
But Jenkins, who showed pictures of 30-foot anaconda snake skins spanning desks in a classroom, said that this interaction allowed for a sense of understanding of the objects of study.
“How are you going to teach animal diversity or variation in a species without looking at them?” Jenkins asked. “Collections are necessary to our students.”
History of Art and Architecture professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger presented on a final project he assigned to students in lieu of a research paper.
Hamburger described and showed pictures of students recasting old medieval texts into modern books and drawing modern books into a medieval form.
“I think the students at first think it will be easier than writing a research paper,” Hamburger said. “But some of them really provide imaginative products.”
But Hamburger said that these projects—“which help instill real research habits”—are both time and resource intensive.
“It requires the cooperation of the libraries,” Hamburger said. “And so it requires investment and more resources.”
University Professors Laurel T. Ulrich and Peter L. Galison ’77 also joined Jenkins and Hamburger in the panel discussion.
Smith, who was at the Friday event, has re-emphasized the importance of teaching and learning this past academic year, as FAS has worked to recover from a $220 million deficit.
The initiative hopes to strengthen the school’s educational priorities and to benefit research and teaching initiatives, recognizing that both are crucial for the development of better classes.

Amy Poehler will be the Class Day Speaker for this May's Commencement exercises, the Senior Class Committee announced earlier today.
Poehler, a Boston-native, former cast member of Saturday Night Live, and current lead actress in the NBC comedy "Parks and Recreation," will headline the day's speeches. The ceremony will also feature the traditional Ivy and Harvard orations, as well as remarks from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
"We wanted someone people could recognize, who could give a funny and engaging speech," Senior Class Marshall Toby Stein '11 said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette. "During her time on SNL, Amy was a part of our growing up, and there's no doubt she's pretty hilarious."
Last year's speaker was veteran reporter Christiane Amanpour.
