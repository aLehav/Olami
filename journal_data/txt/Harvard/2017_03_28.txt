Accio…. Crustacea?
The Harry Potter universe seems to not only maintain its relevance, but to further cement its legacy every year. The franchise already has hundreds of millions of book sales, billions of dollars in the box office, and multiple amusement parks, but it can now claim something else as its own: a species of crab. If you’re still wondering where to find fantastic beasts after watching the movie released last fall, try Guam. That is where Harryplax severus brings magic to the beaches.
Its name actually serves two purposes, as the researcher who originally discovered it was named Harry Conley, according to Time Magazine. Sadly, Conley passed away before the crab gained official classification as a new species, but fortunately the two University of Singapore scientists who conducted further research decided to pay homage not only to Conley, but to another legendary scientist who missed the eventual recognition of his life’s work—Severus Snape.
The crab joins a long directory of things named for characters and objects from J. K. Rowling’s Wizarding World. This list of namesakes ranges from Australian children—the name Harry skyrocketed in popularity in New South Wales in the years following the release and development of the franchise—to dinosaurs (see Dracorex hogwartsia at a children’s museum in Indianapolis). Furthermore, headlines were made in India last month as a spider, now known as Eriovixia gryffindori, was noted for eerily resembling the famed Sorting Hat of Hogwarts. It’s likely that Ron Weasley would not have been placed into the House most closely associated with bravery if the small arachnid were placed on his head.
Harvard students looking to capture a Harryplax severus crab this Spring Break might want to find Buckbeak or a broomstick first—flights to Guam are stupefyingly expensive.

The interior and exterior of the Qube, Quincy House’s library, are in some ways strikingly different. The inside is colorful, homey, delicate, and decorative. Couches and armchairs are scattered across the space. The floor is covered with ornate rugs and a glass case displays intricate architectural models. A geometric chandelier hangs above and a spiral staircase ascends from the ground floor to the balcony level.
The exterior, on the other hand, is relatively plain and aesthetically simple. Aside from the columns that elevate it from the ground, the only shapes in the facades are rectangles, from the form of the building to the windows to the bricks themselves. Unlike the multi-colored interior, the facade is primarily red and white. The facade’s austere simplicity contrasts with the interior’s playfulness.
Despite their differences, the interior and exterior are united by several key elements. The Qube is elevated, creating space underneath. The balcony inside has a similar effect. Four large columns raise the Qube up from the ground, and four columns support the ceiling inside. The spiral staircase in the Qube is mirrored by an exterior staircase. This staircase is rectangular and therefore more in keeping with the facade’s style, but it, like the spiral staircase, doubles back on itself. Large windows serve as literal portals between outside and in.
The result is a space that is separate yet harmonious with the rest of Quincy House. Silent and spacious, the Qube seems like a library out of a fantasy novel.
The importance of aesthetics is clear: the design of the Qube, with its giant armchairs, bright colors and striking geometries, creates a relaxing yet stimulating space that is ideal for study. In fact, images and design are prominent in libraries in general. Libraries are often architecturally intricate, and sometimes even, as with Widener or the Boston Public Library, decorated with murals and paintings which provide a visual education to the visitor in history and mythology.

Given the comparison and sometimes even competition—think of the phrase “a picture speaks a thousand words”—between visual and written images, the importance of the visual aesthetic in a house of words is intriguing. With a library like the Qube, this comparison is particularly striking. It is easy to see how the visual elements of a library could serve the written elements: Design can be used to create an environment conducive to reading. As libraries are, at their core, spaces for books, this subservience of the visual to the texts seems logical.
But the Qube is neither staffed nor circulating, which means that it is harder to find and use books, suggesting that its purpose is a space for study rather than a container to hold books. The colorful spines of the books add to the visual effect. Here, not only does the visual support the textual, but the textual serves the visual as well.

In “Things We Lost in the Fire,” Argentinian author Mariana Enriquez’s new collection of short stories, disturbing and eerie tales of Argentinian life seep onto every page. "Things We Lost in the Fire" is a macabre collection of stories narrating the lives of Argentinians from very different backgrounds and lifestyles. The collection is strikingly entertaining, but instead of facilitating a connection to the characters with its pithy emotion, it eats into you with its morbidity. While the stories often incorporate the supernatural in some way, they are far from being what one consider “ghost stories.” The paranormal elements are more additions than they are the cruxes of the stories, and as such often feel forced. The terse endings and abstract nature of the problems the characters face leave you wanting more.
"Things We Lost in the Fire" is rooted in escapism and people’s ambivalence regarding the circumstances in which they live. We see the lives of the various characters through a lens of numbness and an odd, somewhat misplaced sense of contempt. “The Dirty Kid,” the opening story, lays the foundation for what this book could have been: a deep and introspective look into how Argentina’s troubled past is shaping its present generations. The story provides a glimpse into the life of a fairly well-off journalist who chooses to reside in one of the poorest, most crime-ridden neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. It is a tale of how poverty can affect more than those who are directly affected by it. Most importantly, it is a commentary on should-haves and regrets. It comes off as the foundation for the book, providing relatable peeks and glimpses of raw emotion through the development of the relationship between the dirty kid and the unnamed main character. From saints of death to the gritty underground of Buenos Aires’ subways, “The Dirty Kid” provides intense narratives with a deep social context.
The social commentaries in the stories following “The Dirty Kid,” however, do not share this style as much. While still macabre, grotesque, and emotionally gripping, the stories often add ghostly or paranormal elements that undermine, or conversely, magnify the problems facing the characters. This technique gives the stories an aura of ghastliness and makes for a very interesting read, but the paranormality of the situations often takes away from the problems at hand by making them seem unfixable or inexplicable. The plights of the characters are often undercut by this supernatural component even when the message and moral of the story are otherwise strong.
Rather than letting the problems be human ones that require insight and introspection to solve, the author abstracts the problems from the characters through paranormal instances which diminish the impact of the characters’ actions, like in the story “Adela’s House.” While Adela has a compelling backstory and the plot is developed effectively, it is difficult to feel empathy for the supporting characters and their struggles due to the dehumanization of their problems. This comes from the fascination that the characters have with an abandoned house located in the neighborhood where they live. The connection one makes with the characters, particularly Adela, causes a feeling of empathy that diminishes throughout the story with the unveiling of the house’s paranormal side. This fundamentally detracts from that connection, and because of that it is difficult to truly perceive the quandaries in which the characters end up.
Aside from the menacing tone, the stories are captivating, interesting, and just disturbing enough to keep you up at night. Approached from the viewpoint of a one-off read, they are delightful and leave the reader wanting more. However, by the same token, this disparateness leaves one looking for extensive meaning where there may not be. Mariana Enriquez is a wonderful storyteller with terrific prose and a wild imagination. The collection as such did not live up to the potential that the individual stories carried with them. The disconnectedness of the stories ultimately makes them fall flat—allowing the reader to abstract him- or herself from the lives of the people in each one. The manifestation of problems as paranormal happenings provides a fascinating read, and fans of the horror genre will not be disappointed by the twists and turns evoked throughout the collection. Ultimately though, upon closing the cover, something crucial to the coherency of the stories is missing.

Part of what makes “The Americans” one of the best shows currently airing is the nuanced and often unexpected ways the episodes of the season fit together to make what is usually a truly great narrative arc. This style can lead to individual episodes feeling somewhat sluggish, but that’s generally not a problem in most episodes where the audience gets to savor the brilliance of actors Matthew Rhys, Keri Russell, and Noah Emmerich, among others.
I wrote over the last few weeks that the season seems a bit slow. This episode made me rethink my analysis. The season is definitely slower than previous ones; that hasn’t changed. But it might be less of an issue than I first thought, because these first few episodes, taken together, constitute the beginning of a metamorphosis for both Stan and the Jennings.
The Jennings, of course, are all on their own journeys of moral evolution and emotional self-discovery. Philip, who has questioned his allegiance to the Soviet Union multiple times over the course of the show, is brought back to those questions by the defector working in the Department of Agriculture. Are bread lines so much better than restaurants and supermarkets? Elizabeth is more of a true believer, but her experience with her children will certain test her allegiance to her mother country. And Paige, who is learning to fight and lie like her parents (but feels terrible about it), will surely come to a point where she either must commit to living like her parents, or tell the world their secret—a possibility that would not end well for any of the Jennings.
Even Stan’s steadfast belief in the U.S.’s fundamental goodness was shaken in episode two, after he came face to face with the shrewd pragmatism of his country’s intelligence agencies. The F.B.I.’s willingness to blackmail former Soviet diplomat Oleg, even though it would put him in mortal danger, forces Stan to rethink his commitments. This episode, we see the F.B.I. acting on their plan, as Oleg is delivered a recording of himself revealing state secrets. In the wrong hands, the tape could mean a very dead Oleg. To further emphasize the U.S.’ lack of moral superiority, this scene takes place just after Oleg refuses a bribe from the operator of a Soviet grocery store trying to evade inspection. There’s a deep irony here: one of the few decent men left in the Soviet government is blackmailed by a country which claims the moral high ground.
So far, season five of “The Americans” seems to be all about knocking America down a peg or two with cold, hard facts (abet through the edifice of fiction). This episode, Philip and Elizabeth discover that mass production of crop-destroying insects has already begun. As they explain to their daughter, “they [the U.S. government] go after us any way they can, including the food people eat.” Their work, then, takes on a certain moral quality, as Philip describes: “if we stop this, then a lot of people won’t have to suffer.”

As a longtime fan of Mass Effect, a series of video games set among the stars in the distant, intergalactic future, the weeks leading up to the release of the newest game in the critically acclaimed series were particularly nerve-wracking. Article after article bemoaned the game’s animation, or writing, or any of a number of technical complaints. Driven in part by the piecemeal review embargo placed on the game, players were fed a trickle of information that seemed to indicate the game might be going the way of so many ambitious sequels before it: downhill.
After a good number of hours with the game, my fears of a completely bungled sequel have been, for the most part, assuaged. The first thing the player understands after booting up “Andromeda” is that the game is absolutely giant. You play as Ryder, daughter or son of the Pathfinder aboard one of several Arks sent out from Earth to the Andromeda systems to colonize the galaxy. Within the first ten hours, you have taken on the mantle of Pathfinder and are gallivanting across alien planets in search of viable homes for your people. Not only are the environments large enough in scope and scale to be imposing—more importantly, the game will require a lot of your time.
While the main storyline might take a mere sixteen hours or so on average to complete—not a lot for a full-price, AAA title—early reports from players indicate a fully finished game might require an average of just over 81 hours. That’s a lot of hours, to be sure, but only completionists are likely to spend that kind of time on a single playthrough. The practical longevity of “Andromeda” is somewhat undercut by its own genre. As anyone familiar with the standard role-playing or massively multiplayer online game will know, many of these hours will follow largely the same structure. Despite genuine attempts by the developers to dress up humdrum fetch quests or “kill x many of y creature” tasks, there’s only so much creativity allowed in the limited format.
The developers have gone back, in some ways, to the greater focus on role-playing featured in “Mass Effect,” which was rolled back in favor of more straightforward combat through the second and third games. This means a couple of things, both good and bad. First and foremost, it means you should expect to spend a lot of time in this game: a lot of time thinking about what abilities you want, and a lot of time getting the experience needed to level up and acquire them. In earlier Mass Effect titles, you were pretty much locked into your abilities once you picked them. This didn’t mean much to hardcore players who’d done their research, but it could make the games well-nigh unplayable for the novice just picking abilities that sounded cool without considering effective combinations. It also meant that you couldn’t reinvent your character: if you wanted to shift from a focus on combat to a focus on team support, your only real option was to start a new game. To its credit, each level you gain in “Andromeda” provides enough points that you can try almost all of the abilities within the first ten hours of the game, and you can refund your ability points to change up your play style much more easily and frequently than in previous games.
But make no mistake: “Andromeda” is nothing like the arcade style of Call of Duty or Halo, where you can just drop into the game for a half hour or so and have a good time. This is a game that’s been designed around the idea that you’ll want to take your time and explore a new universe. If you decide to play this game, be prepared to put in a number of hours.
And you’ll need to, if you’re playing for the story. BioWare prides itself on great stories, and often the most interesting components of their narratives are the characters you meet along the way. “Andromeda” really pushes this emphasis on characters to the extreme, with hundreds more voiced characters than the previous games. Unfortunately, their commitment to story hasn’t made them any better at introductions. Characters will often cross the player’s path at convenient plot points or agree to join your team after almost no persuasion. Once they’re on your ship and you’re getting to know them, the writing ranges from passable to excellent, as is standard for BioWare games.
This isn’t necessarily a departure from form—many of the most beloved characters of the original series were introduced in a similarly awkward fashion, and it took players time to come around to and eventually cherish them. A revamped conversation system that does away with the binary good-or-evil conversation options of the previous games makes these interactions much more interesting and responsive than before, although it doesn’t allow for the same level of ‘badass pragmatic asshole’ dialogue you could squeeze out of an ‘evil’ playthrough in the first three games.
The game as a whole is much the same as its predecessors in thematic ways—interesting characters, an emphasis on player choice, and a solid combat system—while adding a great number of technical improvements. It’s graphically on an entirely different playing field than the first games. (Animations, however, are still a bit wooden.) The addition of the jetpack and dodge features make combat more fluid and movement more fun, and the Nomad is surprisingly fun to drive around on a variety of planets.
These are welcome changes which enhance the feeling of exploration that the original games attempted to create, changes which are helped along by the shakeup of your character’s position and mission. In the first three games, you were a highly trained special operations soldier tasked with protecting the Milky Way from a race of super-powerful space squid-robots bent on destroying all sentient life, so it didn’t make a ton of sense that you had time to help find lost jewelry or help someone run an errand. In “Andromeda,” however, your mission is to explore, and there’s no existential danger that would reasonably require a short timeframe. You are (very occasionally) reminded that there are still people in cryogenic pods who need safe planets to live on, but the game doesn’t go out of its way to do so. For the most part, the story leaves you free to do side quests or main story missions alike at your own pace and in whatever combination you wish.
Ultimately, “Andromeda” is a great game that improves in almost every way on its predecessors. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, and no game ever is. “Andromeda” is a bit rough around the edges in some respects, but let’s remember that many of these same issues were present in the original “Mass Effect,” which grew into a monstrously successful trilogy. This game provides a solid foundation for future games to build on, while being a great game in its own right.

In addition to headliners such as Chance the Rapper and Mumford and Sons, Boston Calling Music Festival, coming to the Harvard Athletic Facilities May 26-28, will also feature many bands native to New England. Among them is Piebald, an alternative rock band hailing originally from Andover, Massachusetts. Singer and guitarist Travis Shettel talks to The Crimson about how his band came back together, having previously also included Aaron Stuart, Andrew Bonner, and Luke Garro, and how it has kept him young.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you guys meet and start the band?Travis Shettel: Aaron and I went to high school together, and we went to school with Andy, the bass player’s sister, and through her we met Andy. And Luke, in the original four—the drummer—also went to Andover High School, so we went to high school with him as well.
THC: How did you come up with the name?TS: The name was in a book when we were in high school and when we were searching for a name, so I guess around 1994-ish. I can’t remember the class, I don’t remember what the book was anymore. But I remember seeing the word and not knowing what it meant. So Aaron and I looked it up, and it means spotted and of opposite colors which really doesn’t have any specific meaning to us. But we just liked the word and thought it sounded cool … So we just went for it!
THC: Piebald disbanded for a couple of years. What led to the break?
TS: Everyone’s life took priority. People wanted to go back to school, people were starting families. We weren’t as popular as we once were, and it was harder to go on tour. Less tours were being offered, and it was a natural time to call it. Obviously, we remained friends. Growing up, you know?THC: Did being a part of a band keep you from having to grow up?
TS: Yeah, I’d say so. I still don’t know what I want to do when I grow up. And I’m almost forty. I should already be grown up, and I’m not. I think there is something about being in a band and traveling around that means that you might not realize that you’re getting older. It’s different when you’re surrounded sometimes by someone that might have a nine-to-five desk job. And I think it’s interesting because I had a youth in my twenties that I wouldn’t trade for anything. It was a unique experience. Not everybody gets to travel around the United States and Europe and play the shows with their friends. It still is. We’re playing shows now. It’s nice that it’s being re-appreciated.
THC: What’s changed in the time off?
TP: I’d say that we are more proficient musicians. All of us have still been playing even though Piebald hasn’t together. I was in a few bands in Los Angeles, Aaron was in a few bands, Luke and his wife played together. Andy’s probably played the least of us, but I do think that there is at least a slight [addition] to our maturity now. We’ve had at least ten years of life and playing, and as adults you may see things that change you a little, you know?THC: What’s the connection like between you guys?
TS: I hate all the guys in the band. they’re terrible people. I play guitar and sing and I try not to talk to them if it’s possible.
THC: You’re joking, right?
TS: Yes, absolutely. I didn’t quite have a good/real response.
THC: What’s been your favorite Piebald song?
TS: Just one. Just one?
THC: You can pick a couple.
TS: Well it’s really hard, because I think I would’ve had a clearer answer for this ten years ago, but now … they’re like chapters in a book, and I can’t change them. And that book is part of my life. I’m sure I have one, but they’re all like our little children. One of my favorites is “Karate Chops for Everyone But Us.” I really like that one, it’s fun. I like the lyrics a lot still. We often play it first, so you just immediately see what may be the energy of the show from the first 30 seconds, and that’s kind of a cool feeling.
THC: What are you most excited about for Boston Calling?
TS: That I get to see Converge and Chance the Rapper. I’ve never seen Tool, that’ll be cool. So I’m excited to see other bands. See some friends, see other bands. And to drink beer? I like drinking beer. And it’ll probably be free, too.

Terrence Malick’s “Song to Song” opens with what seems like a trailer for the rest of the film, yet the two hours that follow introduce little more in narrative content or character development. The film also disappoints in its overindulgent similarity to Malick’s recent work, such as the 2015 “Knight of Cups.” Although visually stunning, and occasionally impressive in its ambition to portray human intimacy, the lack of a narrative theme results in a work that is for the most part annoyingly boring.
The film stars Rooney Mara as a soul-and-self-searching young songwriter called Faye who enters a love triangle with Ryan Gosling’s charming musician and Michael Fassbender’s manipulative music executive. Faye seems to be the movie’s focus, although its attention drifts (in somewhat the same way that the movie’s characters do in their lives) from character to character, with each presenting his or her perspective on fragmentary moments of their lives in a series of voiceovers certainly familiar to any fans of Malick’s oeuvre. The performances in the film rely heavily on the obvious natural charisma of the main trio, which unfortunately results in a sense of boredom for audiences who have seen Gosling play another struggling yet agreeable musician in “La La Land” or aren’t interested in suffering through (and with) Fassbender in yet another one of his roles as a cold-blooded, debauched, and unhappy man.
The voiceovers seem to be a double-edged sword for Malick. Occasionally they result in laughably cheesy moments, such as a scene when Faye talks about her desire to be weightless and to fly away, accompanied by shots of the trio departing to what looks like Mexico on a private jet. In other cases, however, they fortify the supporting characters. When the film introduces the music executive’s internal perspective, for example, the voiceover evokes empathy rather than producing eyerolls, as it might have in earlier scenes narrated by Faye. However, it is unfortunate that while female characters dominate the voiceovers, their stories in the film do little to further explore their psyches. Natalie Portman’s teacher-turned-waitress Rhonda, for instance, becomes a perfect trope in the story after she marries the music executive.
Malick shot most scenes in his collage-like, highly stylized manner, with quick cuts and impressionistic cinematography that make it hard to tell if the narrative is entirely linear within scenes. The framing of architecture makes it highly suggestive, and Malick rarely shows two characters fully in the same image, often cutting off parts of faces. The actors’ bodies and spatial relationships become important clues to their feelings for each other, especially in the overwhelming absence of dialogue.
Malick is aided in the creation of such images by the Academy Award-winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. He translates the emotional exuberance the characters experience into intense, beautiful visuals full of light despite the seemingly necessary imprecision that comes with Malick’s signature use of handheld camera. The technical brilliance of the two allows Malick to realize his ability as master of portraying intimacy. Despite rarely taking the visual perspective of any of the characters, the film never feels voyeuristic.
However, while the music industry is the focus of the film, the relevance of music in the movie is questionable. Despite numerous cameos by artists such as Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, only Smith and Lykke Li play truly important roles. Smith appears as a sage mentor (although very rarely a musical one) to Faye, and her air of wisdom is convincing enough to warrant her addition to the movie’s array of characters. Lykke Li, on the other hand, is much less successful in the translation of her real-life enigma to her onscreen counterpart as a freewheeling ex-girlfriend of Gosling’s musician. Finally it seems that despite setting the movie in the music scene of Austin, the only role of music (beyond setting and disrupting moods, which is rather commonplace) in the movie is to create conditions for the characters to dance and for Malick to further cinematically explore physical contact through visual language in these sequences.
Putting the music theme aside, most sequences of “Song to Song” can blend into any other recent Malick movies. Both the characters and the aesthetics are a note too familiar, and the film soon starts feeling conventional rather than experimental. Malick seems to romanticize the irregularity of the lives of musicians, without ever truly engaging with the nature of their work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At his talk at the Harvard Art Museums last Tuesday evening, Barkley Hendricks, an American portraitist famous for his depiction of African Americans subjects in everyday life, presented a series of his paintings. “Give yourself a round of applause for coming out,” he said as he ascended the podium. “Enjoy and put your heads to work a little with some of the imagery that you’ll see.” As he presented a slideshow of his work, Hendricks maintained a light and friendly manner, telling stories, cracking jokes and introducing the audience to his subjects. Hendricks framed his presentation around the stories that defined his art.
He then sat down for a short discussion with Matt Saunders, assistant professor of Visual and Environmental Studies, and questions from the audience. Hendricks discussed his life, his interests, his philosophy and the politics of his work, but seemed happiest to discuss individual paintings.
Asked to describe the most difficult thing he ever did as an artist, Hendricks answered simply,  “It wasn’t difficult for me.” For Kathryn A. McCawley ’17, this ease came across in Hendricks’s presentation of his work. “It was very clear that he was someone who just took a lot of joy from his work,” McCawley said.
At some points, Hendricks offered advice to the audience. While discussing “Mayreh,” a portrait of a young white woman, Hendricks paused to tell the story of someone who told him they could not paint black people, and someone else who said they could not paint white people. In both cases, Hendricks said, he denied their claims. “If you can paint, you can paint anybody. You’ve got to learn how to sort of work with color, and don't let the stupidness of the culture mess up your eyes in terms of your visual thinking."
Mostly, though, Hendricks told narratives, allowing race and politics to come through in the pieces themselves. “His focus was just presenting the artwork and then talking about the people who were represented in the piece,” McCawley said. “It was just beautiful to see how much he truly cared about the people in his paintings.”
Hendricks told stories of how he met his subjects. It seemed almost as if he was introducing his audience to the people in his paintings. “This is ‘Big Chuck,’” he said as one piece appeared on the screen. It was unclear whether he was referring to Big Chuck, the man, or “Big Chuck,” the painting. “I would have to credit Big Chuck with introducing me to my current wife today,” he added.
As he presented his works, Hendricks told stories about the people he depicted. He described an old friend, his former girlfriends, a friend who joined and then left the Black Panther Party, and Corbett, who grew up drawing with Hendricks and then went to prison while Hendricks went to art school. As he discussed his subjects, the artist wove narratives with his words just as he did with his paintings.
Mary Schneider Enriquez ’81, curator of modern and contemporary art at the Harvard Art Museums, commented on Hendrick’s effective depictions of not just physical features, but people as individuals. “When he tells you who they are, you see that he really is giving a sense of who the person is,” Schneider Enriquez said.
Hendricks structured his presentation around simple explanation of the subjects in his portraits and the materials he used to construct them. Joel Seidner, a teaching assistant in Harvard’s Visual and Environmental Studies department, believes the stories are interwoven with the images. “The images do stand for themselves, and he feels no need to explain them and the way that they have gone unchanged from the story that influenced them,” said Seidner.
According to Schneider Enriquez, this focus on the work is what made the event successful. “The purpose of an event like this is precisely a means by which we all learn more what is behind the thinking of what an artist brings to his work,” she said.
Schneider Enriquez said that Hendricks’ presentation revealed why and how he makes choices. For her, the importance Hendricks afforded his subjects’ individuality was a striking revelation of his talk. This revelation is particularly useful to Schneider Enriquez as a curator who helps decide how to display Hendricks’ work, but she believes that learning how artists think is valuable for others as well.

“I think it allows us all to see art with more layers of meaning and understanding because it can strike us as extraordinary, but when you have the person who created it explain why and how they did it, it gives it a whole other life,” said Schneider Enriquez.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Boss Baby” has an interesting and unique enough premise that one might walk into the theater expecting a smart animated movie. Potential parallels between the film’s titular baby, voiced by Alec Baldwin, and President Trump (also impersonated by Baldwin on Saturday Night Live) are immediately obvious and, especially in today’s political climate, incredibly clever. Unfortunately, although the film starts on a relatively promising note, it never becomes as smart as it wishes to be, and dumbs down into an unintentionally silly ride with a ridiculous plot and feeble attempts at humor that will only appeal to the most immature of kids.
The film opens with an introduction to the narrator of the film, Tim Templeton (Tobey Maguire), and the Boss Baby. Tim seemingly has a perfect life with his parents, but when the Boss Baby arrives at the Templetons’ home, briefcase in hand, that perfection is immediately disrupted as a contentious relationship is set up between Tim and his new baby brother. Instead of exploring this power struggle between the two brothers, the film quickly puts aside their differences in favor of an outrageous plot involving a rivalry between babies and puppies. It is here that the film starts tumbling downhill and becomes a turn-off-your-brain children’s movie.
The problem here is a script so lazily written that everything seems to be held together only by a thin thread. Characters are haunted not only by muddled motivations, but also by drastic, unjustified changes in emotion. For example, the film sets up the relationship between Tim and the Boss Baby as toxic, but when the Boss Baby reveals his true nature, Tim immediately forgets about his hatred and offers to help him. The structure of the film is similarly hectic, with masses of misplaced exposition arising at random times. It’s almost as if the writers did not know how and when to integrate the backstories of the characters into the film, so they just clumped together all the exposition into three montages and placed them in random spots. It’s also obvious that the writers didn’t put much thought into the movie’s humor, judging by the overabundance of butt shots and fart jokes.
Perhaps the most glaring issue is the film’s overall lack of attention to detail, both in writing and in directing. There are plot holes, narrative inconsistencies, and conveniently placed objects and set pieces left and right. So often the film introduces an element meant to create suspense, only to forget about it one minute later. In a bizarre and miserable attempt to impress the audience, the film attributes the inconsistencies to an unreliable narrator in Tim. However, whereas an unreliable narrator is generally meant to make the viewer question the reality of the events unfolding on screen, the one in this movie serves no purpose but covering up plot holes. What could have been a refreshingly smart element in an animated movie is instead used to conceal the lack of effort by everyone working on this film.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Calvin is a pulsating and terrifying Martian-octopus. He comes to life aboard the International Space Station, after scientist Hugh Derry (Arion Bakare) nurses the beast from a suspended flagellum to a virtually invincible, shockingly bloodthirsty beast. Calvin’s progression from scientific marvel—the celebrated first evidence of life on another planet—to tentacled, sharp-toothed supervillain propels Daniel Espinoza’s terrifying “Life,” a bald-faced “Alien” send-up that succeeds largely on the impressive and understated rendering of its central alien.
Like Ridley Scott’s seminal 1979 film, “Life” explores the compromises that a crew must make as it navigates a vessel infected by a hostile extra-terrestrial intruder. The international crew of initially awed astronauts—led by the serious David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), outgoing Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), and calculating Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson)—push the limits of their ship’s technological capabilities and their own psyches as they dodge Calvin, discuss the existential implications of his unclear motivations for killing, and watch the bizarre amphibian tear their crewmates to gory shreds. Despite its genre trappings, “Life” avoids becoming a retread of an established cinematic formula of existential science fiction, bolstering Calvin’s brilliant CGI rendering to generate legitimate surprises and bringing up salient questions about our collective fetishism toward alien life forms and the universality of cutthroat Darwinian principles.
Near the beginning of “Life,” Espinosa, a Swedish director relatively new to English-language features, offers only fleeting glimpses of civilization back on our pale blue dot. The astronauts, having recently acquired pieces of martian dirt, watch in awe as Hugh adjusts temperatures and chemicals in the Space Station’s lab to spark a seemingly-deceased cell into being, thus signaling the beginning of humanity’s interaction with alien life forces. The being, initially resembling a slimily transparent flower, is undeniably cute, grabbing onto the scientist’s metallic wand and dancing about its airtight chamber. Soon, the astronauts have hooked up to a slightly-futuristic Skype, which they use to beam the new being onto the buildings of a subtly-updated Times Square, where thousands of revelers cheer on the arrival of a new epoch. The shot, complete with a subtle “9G” smartphone advertisement and an array of full-building, interlocking video monitors, highlights Espinoza’s keen eye for technological reference. Once Calvin begins his reign of terror, Espinosa employs another subtly futurological tool—a 3D holographic map at the ship’s center of each crew member’s location vis à vis their tormentor—both to further suggest the contours of his speculative technology and to provide an interior device for understanding the layout of the station.
Where Espinosa impressively places his thriller in a plausible and understated near-future, his actors populate his universe with an understated naturalism that makes the film’s bloodiness all the more terrifying. Gyllenhaal gives a particularly impressive performance as David, a veteran of a seemingly expanded Syrian conflict who moves with a tired but sympathetic grace suggestive of his wariness of earth. After Calvin breaks out of his terrarium and begins his pursuit of the crew’s bodies, David reacts with an icy, profoundly relatable fear, quickly giving out directives and hypothesizing strategies for barricading the creature with whispered intensity. Gyllenhaal’s unique ability to appear simultaneously ready to die and able to defend himself is on thrilling display. Bakare plays the scientist Hugh—a British paraplegic who increasingly regrets his sparking Calvin with life as an unforgivable, Frankensteinian act—with a tenderness that makes his self-loathing incredibly sad to watch. The other players, with the exception of the jokester Reynolds, are almost antiseptically professional even in crisis, but their focus ultimately heightens the tension despite leaving their characters a bit flat. “Life” has no ambition to be an ensemble character study, but it works well as a chase movie with a selective emotional conscience.
A bit of fatigue eventually sets in after the tenth iteration of disaster: The fuel runs out, the heat turns off, a simple spacewalk turns into an inner-helmet coolant drowning, and the crew’s desire to keep the bloodthirsty alien isolated from earth leaves them with few options but self-sacrifice, all while Calvin runs rampant and continues literally eating astronauts’ heads. Despite the drag of the chase, the set pieces are consistently clever and scary, Gyllenhaal remains charismatic, and every shot of Calvin, who continues to morph and grow into a more efficient and hefty killing machine, is more unsettling than the last. By the time the surviving humans finally seem in a position to kill their creation, the script seems headed toward a relieving and somewhat welcome resolution. Screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, however, completely pull the rug out in the last sequence of the film, offering a visually-stunning twist that makes the atrophying relentlessness of the film’s second act seem a necessary interlude that provokes viewers to let their guards down before a shattering end.
“Life” is not a particularly profound science fiction offering when stacked up against the likes of “Ex Machina” or “The Martian”, but Espinosa’s eye for the near-future, Calvin’s infectious sliminess, Gyllenhaal’s reliable intensity, and the screenwriters’ third-act magic make the film genuinely scary and often beautiful.

The recent Crimson reporting about current distance running coach Patrick Wales-Dinan underscores the delicate equilibrium between academics and athletics at Harvard. While current members of the team have praised the coach for creating a healthy environment and providing mentorship, others, including former members, have criticized his coaching style for negatively impacting their social lives, academics, and health. In particular, some have alleged that he allowed athletes to overtrain, miss meals, and lose excessive amounts of weight, all as part of an unhealthy team culture with intense pressure.
Athletics are a large or even integral component in the experiences of many students; however, we recognize that the student-athlete balance varies from student to student.  Joining a varsity team is a decision that has major ramifications, shaping schedules and various other parts of college life. The Athletics Department and Jason S. Saretsky, the head coach of track and cross country, have all highlighted the concurrent importance they place on academics, but the controversy suggests that the balance can sometimes not be adequately defined or implemented in practice.
Academics, social life, and physical and mental health are all critical to formulating the overall liberal arts experience that Harvard seeks to provide to its students. Athletes should not have to compete in an environment where they feel the commitment asked of them is detrimental to any of those aspects of their lives. Each day, student athletes seek to balance each facet of their life; athletic responsibilities or coaches' expectations should avoid fully infringing on their attempts to strike that balance.
That is not to say that students should fully dictate the terms. As a commitment, athletic teams, like student organizations, are right to ask for a certain level of involvement from their members. It is appropriate for coaches, as the managers and leaders of their teams, to ask for an appropriate amount of time and personal investment from their athletes. Nevertheless, they should always be mindful of the exact commitment demanded and endeavor to never reach the point where athletics overshadows other parts of the Harvard experience.
The current situation on the cross country team demonstrates the crucial role that student-athletes can, and should, play in keeping coaches accountable for their handling of the academics-athletics balance. Responsible action can ensure that a better balance emerges or stays in place. Since students are the ones whose lives are ultimately affected, it is essential that they make their voices heard.

Nine out of ten times, a two hour class is a mini-fugue. The clock ticks in memorandum for the time you could have spent anywhere and everywhere else. You could’ve had the pulse of the world under your thumb, but those two hours (of which you cannot remember learning a thing) robbed you of these opportunities. When the class ends, that fiery fervor you had for life two hours ago has now whimpered into barely-glowing coals raked over your shoulders, under your tongue, below your feet. You feel your will steep, the passion seeping out from all over. The only mercy you crave is for the sweet embrace of a nap to wrap its hands around your shoulders and lull you into comfortable quasi-amnesia. But that’s your bit of sacrifice for a good grade, two hours. Seems relatively harmless, doesn’t it?
Yet, a two hour class I had a few weeks ago was not like the others.The professor usually starts class with an anecdote and leads into the topic; ironically, I don’t remember what the intended lesson was. What I do remember, however, is the lesson I took home:
“We were on a road trip to upstate New York, and I—my wife was driving—I was in the passenger seat reading a research journal for work and was taking notes like I do on all the family trips, and my son was in the back doing something…” He trailed off tangentially, blurring thoughts together. “You know, I once participated in a sleep chamber experiment. I thought I was one of those guys who could run on four-five hours, but I was wrong. That’s when I changed my life around. I started leaving the lab a bit earlier. Taking more vacations with my family. Putting them first and work second. Or at least I tried to. I think I did.”
Maybe I remembered his words wrong. Maybe I should’ve thought twice when he spoke of car rides and family and all I heard was the clock ticking, little boy calling out for attention. Maybe it’s the way my memory held his like hands overlapping, smoothing out the raw edges until I could hold his thoughts like a snow globe between my synaptic gaps. I shook the memory around anyway and watched the pieces of his life I knew float around the scene: top of his field, two time Ivy League graduate, successful, tenured Harvard professor, renowned researcher, former revered medical professional. He had all the attributes a typical Harvard student aspires towards—yet this was simply the snow, the fluff in the globe.
These titles are powerful, indubitably so; however, they are also heavy with the weight of sacrifices. Some of us know the word all too well by now: the typical high school experience lost between the pages of a textbook, the grade in lieu of the adventure, the litany of exciting, carefree potentialities compromised by the actuality of calculated academia and future careers being top priority. Our conception of the word sacrifice is finite. We tell ourselves that what we miss out on is “just for now”, that we can relive these missed opportunities in heaps and reams once we reach our respective successes. We convince ourselves that sacrifice is simply a necessary evil that must occur for us to reach our dreams.
The snow globe tells me a different story. This sacrifice, this torrent of snow, is infinite. Despite the lies we dress up as truths in the mirror, the reality is that the sacrifices never end; they simply reinvent themselves in new ways. One could reach the pinnacle of their respective field as my professor has, yet there will always be something one must give up in order to achieve such success in other aspects of their life.
And this give and take seems logical; one could say that this isn’t really a sacrifice at all, that doing what you love and achieving your lifelong goals is more of a gain than anything else. I’m tempted to agree with this rosier reality. We came here for our studies, and due diligence to them plus tunnel vision and a dash of luck gives way to the results we are looking for. Simple input and output process, as it seems; we shouldn’t be quick to criticize the path we’ve chosen for ourselves. Yet, when I cling to this thought, the thorns bristle under my grasp, drawing out more crimson in me than I expected. To reach such heights, you’re bound to become oxygen-deprived. To accomplish such feats, you’re expected to see only your goals, cataracts developing instinctually in the face of anything else. To be at the top of your field, you can’t quagmire yourself in the moment; you must always be working towards the peak. I don’t know if I am ready to give the sights along the way for the vistas at the top.
Although I don’t want to miss out on the sights or any of these definitive moments, if given the option to throw caution to the wind and follow this path, nine times out of ten I would turn my back to it. Maybe this can be chocked up to negligence or fear of change or some twisted sense of pomp or even out of pure stubbornness, but I fear that I will continue along this trench that so many of us students dig ourselves into, pigeonholing into this hollow mold in the hopes that sacrifice is the wrong word for the choices we’ve made.
Quietly, almost inconspicuously so, most of us will likely marshal ourselves into the contained snow globe world—but to how many will this world be a blizzard? How many will see the beauty beyond the snow—how many would care to know what’s past it?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 3, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study hosted a conference “to explore the relationship between slavery and universities.” During the conference, University President Drew G. Faust and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates discussed the prospect of reparations for American slavery. As in previous discussions, President Faust did not directly charge Harvard with the responsibility to recompense for its involvement.
It strikes us as odd that President Faust—a historian who has dedicated much of her academic life to the study of the American Civil War (and therefore the history of American slavery)—could both acknowledge Harvard’s ties to slavery and simultaneously fail to articulate a plan of repayment. Preferring to confront the damning legacies of slavery and Jim Crow through small plaques and platitudes, President Faust has made it clear that the sins of the past are not directly transferrable to the present.
But how do we clear the iniquities of the past? How do we correct for historical injustices? What does it mean to erase our longstanding debts to previous generations? The answers to these questions are bound to the American conscience. And Harvard’s moral account continues to collect interest.
The maintenance of a system that subjugates black people in America is not accidental—it is a product of ideas promulgated at institutions of higher learning. Segregation, slavery, and racism are deeply tied to the American intellectual spirit. They are components of an epistemological ideology that was pioneered at Harvard University.
In the 19th century, Professor Louis Agassiz forwarded human polygenism, the theory that human races have separate evolutionary origins. Because of this racist ideology, the seemingly burgeoning solidarity between free blacks, poor whites, and European immigrants—who were all exploited by a system of cheap labor—was transformed into a relationship of division, mistrust, and bigotry. This prevented several opportunities for robust interracial cooperation within labor organizations. The intellectual development of scientific racism robbed black individuals of potential allies, thereby enabling America to dehumanize and criminalize black bodies en masse.
Harvard has continued to give credence and public platforms to individuals who endorse scientific racism. Take, for example, psychologist Richard Herrnstein, who, though an expert on pigeon behavior, claimed to have discovered a biological basis for human intelligence (and opportunely found that black people had lower IQ scores due in part to genetics). In collaboration with Charles Murray (designated a white nationalist by the Southern Poverty Law Center), Herrnstein published “The Bell Curve” in 1994. While one might hope to see some type of honest debate or discussion following the publishing of the book (something that critics always bellow when anything controversial occurs on college campuses), there was little to none.
Dehumanization (on the basis of intelligence or natural ability) is an often-used justification for inequality. And it is deeply linked to the ways that we selectively understate the harm borne by certain groups. Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, in his book, “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined”, argues that “it’s a good time in history to be a potential victim.” By peddling intellectual excuses for oppression, he is ironically celebrated for his intellectual bravery. Unfortunately, the legacy of Harvard University is one in which too modest a space has been granted to progressive scholars and too large a space has been reserved for apologists of oppression.
Apologists and apologies do nothing to ameliorate historical trauma. Though newly freed black individuals, the white working class, and European immigrants might have created coalitions to challenge the status quo following the abolition of slavery, elite institutions such as Harvard dedicated resources and platforms to individuals who would continue to distort the working class identity in America.
Harvard’s legacy is also tied to the Christian ministry. Although Christianity was a tool used to legitimize racial hierarchies, the religious abolitionists who fought against slavery understood that moral debts are not easily repaid.
President Faust and administrators have once again chosen to defer the repayment of Harvard’s moral debt to Black America. But unlike God, they lack the power to deliver themselves from debts of the soul.
“The past never dies or disappears. It continues to shape us in ways we should not try to erase or ignore.”—President Drew Gilpin Faust

Landscape Services, a unit of Harvard Campus Services, is replacing their traditional, fuel-powered landscaping equipment with battery-powered counterparts in an attempt to reduce noise and air pollution.
Landscape Services installed new leaf blowers, grass trimmers, and tree pruners following a pilot program that tested electric leaf blowers in the Science Center Plaza last year. Workers reported that the battery-powered versions performed just as effectively as gasoline-powered ones.
Landscape Services Manager Wayne P. Carbone said quieter, gasoline-powered leaf blowers were adopted ten years ago in response to a 2007 Cambridge ordinance requiring lower decibel levels in leaf blowers. The new leaf blowers are not only quieter than the old leaf blowers, but also emit no air pollution.
“We wanted to go one step further and see if we could start working on not only reducing the decibels on our blowers and small engine equipment, but also [reducing] emissions–which would be advantageous to the community, the environment, the University, and the operators of the equipment,” Carbone said.
The leaf blowers are part of Harvard’s larger Organic Landscaping Initiative, which has replaced chemical-free fertilizers, and introduced composting and organic fertilizers over the last ten years.
“Our organics program is one of the leaders in the country, and this is just an expansion of that,” Carbone said. “We’ve eliminated all chemical use on campus, all synthetic fertilizers; it’s been a pretty successful program. As always, we’re always looking for green products.”
Carbone said his long-term goals as Manager of Landscaping Services are sustainability-driven and that Harvard can set a precedent with its landscaping practices.
“I think they’re positive changes. I’m glad that Harvard is giving us the opportunity to expand these programs, and my goal is to reduce or eliminate all small combustible engines in the future,” he said. “If we can do that and prove that it can be done in a university setting, then hopefully others will take on the challenge.”
After evaluating the success of the Yard program, Carbone said Landscape Services could expand the battery-powered equipment to all undergraduate residential areas, and potentially academic areas after that.

UPDATED: March 30, 2017 at 4:44 a.m. 
Months after announcing it would radically revise its investment strategy by the end of the fiscal year, Harvard Management Company will invest at least $300 million into a hedge fund formed by some of its former money managers, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
The money is earmarked for a hedge fund formed by former HMC employees Michele Toscani and Graig Fantuzzi, two investors who previously served as portfolio managers at the University’s struggling investment arm. The news came earlier this year after HMC’s Chief Executive Officer N.P. Narvekar announced the firm would cleave its internal staff in half by the end of the calendar year and shutter most of its internal investment team by the close of the fiscal year.
Additionally, Rene Canezin, a managing director at HMC and head of public markets and natural resources, is considering striking off from the firm to launch his own hedge fund, according to Bloomberg. If he does, HMC will reportedly place another $300 million in the care of his new hedge fund. Canezin did not respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment, and HMC spokesperson Emily Guadagnoli declined to comment for this story.
Harvard’s highly-successful real estate investment team will also split from HMC but still invest some of firm’s money, according to a letter Narvekar wrote in January outlining a five-year plan to improve the University’s lagging endowment returns. The shift, while significant in the scope of HMC’s history, aligns the firm’s investment strategy with that of peer institutions and will likely yield increased returns, some experts predict.
It is typically more expensive to use external managers to invest a firm’s money than to rely on internal teams, but University President Drew G. Faust said in February that the additional costs Harvard will incur are justified if new external managers can revitalize the University’s languishing endowment. In fiscal year 2016, Harvard returned negative 2 percent on its investments—the lowest it has posted since the height of the financial crisis. Faust said the poor endowment performance was likely to pressure University budgets for years to come.

UPDATED: July 10, 2017 at 4:53 p.m.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life, which officially opened in the basement of Boylston Hall in 2012, celebrated its fifth birthday Monday night. Dozens gathered in Ticknor Lounge to celebrate the anniversary with cupcakes, toasts, and conversation.
Sheehan D. Scarborough '07, who has directed the office since Feb. 6, said he found the event successful.
“The event went really well,” Director of BGLTQ Student Life Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 said. “The most important thing for me was that students would come today and see that there is a vibrant community of people to support them.”
The celebration featured button making, education about resources, celebratory toasts, and food. The food display included an array of rainbow cupcakes boasting a candle with the number five in the middle.
During the celebration, Scarborough toasted to the Office’s fifth birthday and spoke about his hopes for the future of Harvard's BGLTQ student life. Scarborough said he is excited for the office to move into its newly-renovated space in Grays Hall next year. The new space will be on the ground floor of the building, and will have a kitchen, lounge, and library, Sheehan said.
“This is a really wonderful moment for Harvard College,” Scarborough said about the new space. “They’ve invested so much in this space and now we get to be the ones to use it and make it the best that it can possibly be.”
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair also spoke at the event, highlighting her hope for the office’s future success.
“We’re really looking forward to the next century,” she said in her speech. “It’s not gonna be another five years. It’s gonna be another century.”
The current BGLTQ Office was preceded by several initiatives attempting to support BGLTQ-identifying undergraduates.
The Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporter Alliance Resource Center opened in 1998 in the basement of Holworthy, according to the office’s website. In 2009, the BGLTSA Resource Center changed its name to the Queer Resource Center. Then, in 2011 former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced that the College would hire a full-time staff for the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
Scarborough acknowledged, however, that there have also been setbacks in the Office’s recent history, citing the potential arrival of the anti-transgender “Free Speech Bus” in Boston on Tuesday as a key example of homophobia and transphobia that still exist.
“In 2012 when the office was created, it was a very different political landscape. We were on the cusp of huge political achievement. We are entering into such a different political environment, and we’re seeing the effects of that everyday,” Scarborough said. “This bus can come to town, it has its own message. We have a different message. It’s important to make that message loud and clear all the time.”
Although the BGLTQ community continues to face prejudice, Scarborough still believes the community is “in a very good place in terms of rights and visibility.”
Jessica R. Fournier ’17 said she was optimistic about the Office’s future.
“This is an important office and it’s part of a much larger and vibrant core community,”said. “I think it will be around for many years to come.”

Adding a Scandinavian touch to the Square, Swedish outdoor brand Fjällräven held its grand opening—complete with live music, food, promotions, and giveaways—at 63 Church St. on March 24.
Fjällräven is best known for the Kånken backpack, its top-seller originally designed for Swedish schoolchildren in the 1970s. The brand also sells a wide variety of outdoor and hiking clothing and accessories, all marketed as streamlined, sustainable, and with durable Scandinavian design.
The Harvard Square store is Fjällräven’s second Boston-area location, after its smaller Newbury St. counterpart opened in 2013. The Square location sits next door to the recently shuttered American Apparel at the corner of Church St. and Brattle St.
Nathan Dopp, President at Fjällräven North America, wrote in an emailed statement that he is excited about the new location and larger store, and looks forward to reaching the Cambridge population. The store will offer a ten percent discount to Harvard students. Most Kånken backpacks range from 50 to 100 dollars.
“We know that we resonate well with consumers of all ages and outdoor experience levels. Cambridge has a community that we believe will understand the value and uniqueness we offer,” Dopp wrote.
Elizabeth G. Ashford ’19, who currently sports a Kånken backpack, said she was a fan of the brand.
“I really like this backpack because it is a really good size and you can fit a lot of stuff in it but it’s not too big and it’s comfy on your back,” Ashford said.
Ashford said she was excited about the store’s opening and thinks many Harvard students will enjoy it.
“I really like the brand so I would definitely be happy to go check out more stuff they have,” Ashford said.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, reached out to Fjällräven as they moved into the Square. She said the store expressed interest in becoming a member of the association.
“[They] love Harvard Square and really wants to be a solid contributor to the Square, both as a good community partner and participating in events,” Jillson said.
Dopp wrote that he hopes the store will fit well with the Harvard Square community.
“We hope to bring a place of vibrant energy and a variety of products to the Square,” Dopp wrote. “We want to be a community anchor, a place where explorers, adventurers and families can all come to experience a bit of Sweden.”
Jillson echoed the excitement of Dopp and Ashford.
“It looks like a fun store and we don’t have anything quite like it in Harvard Square, and from what I’ve been told, it has a very, very nice product and it’s a product that everyone who goes to Sweden sees all over the place—children are using their little backpacks going to school and they have a big following in Sweden,” Jillson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Office of Student Life examined student organizations’ activity last semester ahead of the office’s plan to audit student groups every five years, according to Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller.
Speaking to the Undergraduate Council at the body’s general meeting Sunday night, Miller said he asked his staff at the OSL to review student groups’ practices last semester.
“We were able to do some really kind of digging around who’s active, how long, and what’s going on with those groups,” Miller said.
Miller told the UC members that his office will conduct audits of student groups every five years.
“We will do an audit of all our student groups every five years. That is something that I’ve asked our staff to look at,” he said.
Undergraduate student groups previously had to register themselves with the OSL each year in order to remain recognized by the College. If groups failed to renew this registration, they would be deemed “inactive” by administrators and thus ineligible for certain benefits such as Harvard funding and advising resources.
On Sunday night, the Undergraduate Council amended its constitution and bylaws to give itself the responsibility to recommend the creation of student groups. The move marks a major shift in the process by which student groups join the College.
Miller said the data from the audit revealed a significant portion of student groups end up become “inactive” after launching.
“We have seen turnover within the first two years of the groups. We average around 20 to 30 percent of groups going inactive after one to two years,” Miller said.
Miller’s remarks come weeks after a committee to implement penalties on unrecognized social groups recommended that recognized groups “should be examined” to ensure their inclusivity.
“While these organizations are not addressed specifically in this policy, concerns have been raised about the culture that is created by exclusive practices of currently recognized groups,” the report reads.
The Undergraduate Council leaders previously outlined plans to create a “Q Guide” for student groups’ comp processes, to provide students with information on various groups’ application processes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard graduate students continue to criticize Harvard’s response to President Donald Trump’s immigration orders more than a month after they presented a petition to University President Drew G. Faust requesting additional support for international students.
More than 800 people have signed the petition, which the International Student Working Group prepared last month. It urges Harvard to provide more legal, mental health, and immigration support resources for international students affected by Trump’s orders.
On Jan. 27, Trump released an executive order that temporarily banned immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. On Feb. 2 and Feb. 21, Faust signed letters to Trump urging him to repeal the order.
Although the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed that order, Trump released an updated version of the ban that bars immigrants from six majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. A Hawaii district court struck down the ban before it could take effect.
In the petition, delivered to Faust on Feb. 21, students asked for legal and financial support for international students, as well as “immediate and transparent communication” about the effects that immigration policy changes could have on students.
In response to Trump’s orders, Harvard held 18 information sessions about the bans that attracted over 1,000 students. The University has also offered written legal advice to students affected by the ban through the Immigration and Refugee Clinic and has conducted counseling sessions for students through Harvard University Health Services.
Harvard also hired another advisor in the International Office to help international students navigate effects that Trump’s immigration bans will have on them.
But some members of ISGW maintain that Harvard’s response to the immigration orders has been too little too late. Specifically, they argue that Global Support Services, a group that helps Harvard affiliates traveling abroad, cannot adequately assist international students who need to reenter the country.
“It’s a 24 hour service primarily intended for medical emergencies and extreme political events, not immigration services,” Niharika N. Singh, a member of ISWG, said.
According to a Harvard Gazette article about the University’s response to the executive order, Harvard affiliates who are denied reentry to the U.S. can contact “six law firms and legal aid organizations” through Global Support Services.
Signatories of the petition said they were reluctant to use the Immigration and Refugee Clinic, another resource for international students.
“These clinics are used by the broader community—we might be overwhelming and expanding the capacity of already highly busy organizations,” Laura Correa Ochoa, another member of ISWG, said.
Likewise, union organizers asserted that Harvard has not provided mental health resources that adequately address the needs of students affected by the ban.
“Mental health care is quite complicated and often inaccessible,” Correa Ochoa said, urging the University to “hire or train medical practitioners so that they are attentive to the kinds of issues that are affecting international students,” including “cultural or religious concerns.”
But Harvard asserted that it has worked to support international students and respond to the demands outlined in the petition.
“Over the past several months, the University has worked to provide additional resources and support and to advocate for our international students and scholars, who play a critical role in Harvard’s academic mission,” University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an email.
Union organizers also said that Harvard waited too long to respond to the petition.
On March 1, one week after graduate students delivered the petition to Faust,  graduate students said they received an email informing them of resources they could access in the aftermath of the executive order. On March 15, signatories of the petition received an email from Paul R. Curran, Director of Employee and Labor Relations, responding to their demands.
In his email, Curran encouraged them to read a Jan. 29 letter Faust sent to the Harvard community that outlined the University’s response to the executive order and an article published by the Harvard Gazette on the same day he sent his email.
“The University will continue to monitor developments in this space and will adopt as circumstances may evolve,” he wrote.
But Singh and other union organizers did not think this response was adequate.
“The first official response that we received from the administration was nearly three or so weeks after the delivery of the petition,” Singh said, adding it was “remarkable” that Harvard did not respond sooner.
While union organizers criticized the University’s response to some of the petition’s demands, they praised Harvard’s March 1 announcement that the University would pause GSAS students’ G clocks--the number of years that students have to complete a PhD--if they are stuck abroad.
“In some sense, they do address the concerns,” Correa Ochoa said. “For example, G clock pauses—that’s something they addressed.”
The union’s criticisms of Harvard’s response to the petition come during a contentious unionization election. The University and Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers have until April 3 to file post-hearing briefs with the National Labor Relations Board. After receiving these briefs, the NLRB could decide the fate of student unionization at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 28, 2017 at 11:30 a.m. 
When Mark E. Zuckerberg speaks at the University’s afternoon exercises in May, he will be the latest in a series of heads of state, television hosts, journalists, award-winner actors, and Cabinet members to have addressed a year of Harvard graduates.
But he will also join a cadre of overwhelmingly male speakers. In the past 30 years, the University has chosen seven women to deliver the Commencement Day oration—a pattern that some involved in planning graduation exercises criticize.
Avni Nahar ’17, a class program marshal in the Senior Class Committee, said it is “pretty disappointing” to hear that seven women in the past thirty years have been selected for the honor.
“I hadn’t realized the numbers were that low,” Nahar said.
The University President joins the president of the Board of Overseers, president of the Harvard Alumni Association, and chair of the Advisory Committee on Honorary Degrees in selecting Commencement speaker each year, according to University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga.
The Commencement Day speaker addresses all of Harvard’s graduates, gathering from each of the graduate schools and the College. Zuckerberg, a Harvard College dropout, will finally receive a Harvard degree at the 366th commencement ceremony.
DeLuzuriaga declined to comment on whether gender or racial diversity is taken into account in the selection process, but highlighted the diverse backgrounds speakers come from.
“In recent years, Harvard’s Commencement speakers have included a wide range of distinguished individuals from diverse backgrounds and with varied professional accomplishments,” DeLuzuriaga wrote. “The list of the speakers since 2008 is testament to that diversity.”
Since Faust became president in 2008, Harvard has invited three women—author J.K. Rowling, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey—to be commencement speakers.
Nahar and her colleagues in the senior class committee will select the College’s Class Day speaker. The process for selecting Commencement and Class Day speaker is separate, although a liaison from the Harvard Alumni Association checks over the senior class committee’s final list to ensure that the groups are not inviting the same person.
Nahar said she has heard from “a lot of people” that they would “prefer to have a woman class day speaker, even ideally that they would like to have a woman of color.”
“Just because given the environment of Harvard, the makeup of professors, the historical speakers that have been at both commencement and class day—I think many people find it important to highlight voices that haven’t typically been highlighted in this way before,” Nahar said.
Victoria H. Jones ’17, another program marshal, said the committee decided to circulate a survey this year to the senior class, where students could submit write-in recommendations for the speaker. Jones said several hundred seniors responded to the survey.
Jones said gender diversity is “something we’re conscious of, but we’re not actively making a decision based on.”
“If a woman is chosen, that’s just because the person with the highest amount of excitement from the grade was a woman,” she added.
Nahar said she and Jones were proud of the list they have come up with, and said there was a significant amount of racial and gender diversity in the names submitted to the survey.
Some of Harvard’s peer institutions, like Yale and Brown, do not invite commencement speakers. The University of Pennsylvania invited the same number of women as Harvard in the past thirty years.

CORRECTION: March 28, 2017
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that six women had been Commencement speakers in the last 30 years. In fact, seven women have been Commencement speakers in that time frame.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana rejected a proposed summer program for low-income and first generation students earlier this semester, though the College will offer alternative initiatives tailored towards them.
The proposal—dubbed the First Year Institute and developed in part by Freshman Dean’s Office employee Katie W. Steele—calls for a brief freshman pre-orientation program to help low-income students adjust to Harvard.
The First Year Institute is modeled closely after the Freshman Enrichment Program, another summertime initiative for low-income students which Savannah N. Fritz ’17 first proposed to the Undergraduate Council in spring 2015.
A pamphlet for the most recent version of the Freshman Enrichment Program proposes that low-income students arrive on campus a few days before school starts to share meals with College administrators, attend panels with academic counselors, and speak with representatives from the Financial Aid Office and the Office of Career Services.
Both programs were met with “resistance” from Khurana, according to Fritz. She said that in late January, Khurana informed Steele he was not interested in the First Year Institute, prompting Fritz to publish an op-ed criticizing his inaction.
“In lieu” of a program for low-income students, the College plans to create a new, part-time position in the Freshman Dean’s Office titled the “First-Gen Low Income Student Advocate,” Steele wrote in an emailed statement Monday. This individual will specifically advise first generation and low income students, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
“The Advocate will be a dedicated adviser of incoming students, helping them to navigate any academic, personal, financial, or social hurdles they may face,” Steele wrote. “The Advocate will have knowledge of Harvard’s resources and services so that they can connect students with the person or office that is in the best position to address that particular student’s needs.”
Fritz said she thinks the creation of an adviser for low-income undergraduates is “absolutely great.” Still, she said she was saddened to learn Khurana had rejected the First Year Institute.
“It was devastating to hear from him,” Fritz said. “To work on something for two years and to care so much about the future students that it would benefit, and then to have our Dean reject it was devastating.”
In the days following Khurana’s dismissal of the proposal, Fritz said she met with the Dean to ask him why he did not endorse the First Year Institute. She said Khurana did not give her a “clear rationale” for his decision.
Dane wrote in an emailed statement Monday that “Harvard College is deeply committed to facilitating a successful college transition for all students, with the understanding that additional support may be needed for students from under-resourced high schools.”
Fritz said her motivations for starting the Freshman Enrichment Program are deeply personal.
“I come from a very small town, and most people go to a local state school or a community college,” she said. “I definitely had a tough time adjusting to Harvard freshman year… I would like to help prevent students from stumbling in the same way that I have.”

MERRICK MADSEN
Becoming the new center of attention on campus, the Harvard men’s hockey team clinched its first trip to the Frozen Four last weekend since 1994 with wins against Providence and Air Force this past week.
This historic team achievement likely overshadows important personal distinctions awarded over the weekend, such as the Most Outstanding Player in the East Region; this was given to none other than Merrick Madsen, the stalwart junior goalkeeper for the Crimson.
On Friday’s regional semifinal against Providence, Madsen dominated through a complete shutout, tallying an impressive 41 saves. Harvard allowed a total of four power plays during the game, but Madsen preserved his goalless streak through these eight minutes of undermanned play to help the Crimson win 3-0.
“I thought Merrick was our first star,” head coach Ted Donato said. “Merrick was excellent early on and gave us a chance to not have to chase the game.”
Saturday’s 3-2 regional final victory against the United States Air Force Academy was much more nerve wracking, but Madsen’s eight saves in the final period were crucial for Harvard to preserve its lead and emerge victorious. Madsen finished the contest with 27 total saves, holding off a very aggressive Air Force team down three goals by the halfway point of the second period. Madsen’s win extended his single-season wins record to 28 wins, a program-high.
“For me, it’s just getting some bounces and staying focused,” Madsen said. “Once we got through that we felt like we were in a much better place as the game went on.”
Madsen also earned a spot on the 2017 All-East Regional Team along with Harvard senior forward Tyler Moy, sophomore forward Ryan Donato, and freshman defenseman Kyle Fox. In the Crimson’s history, only two members of Harvard’s hockey program have ever been awarded All-Regional honors.
“We’ve gotten big saves when we needed to,” Donato said. “Certainly Merrick had some saves coming down the stretch.”
For the Crimson to continue its quest for a national championship, Merrick will without a doubt need to continue anchoring what appears to be an impenetrable net.
DEAN FARRIS
After a dominant performance in the Ivy League Championships, freshman sensation Dean Farris carried tremendous momentum heading into the 2017 NCAA Championship Meet. Farris did not disappoint, earning three All-America honors during the meet and breaking two school records.
“I think I accomplished all my goals this year,” Farris said. “I was so happy with how the team performed and I think this year sets us up for the future.”
In the 200 freestyle finals on Friday, Farris finished fourth with a time of 1:32.25. This may not immediately jump out as noteworthy until recognizing that the top-three finishers were all former Olympic swimmers. Among these three Olympians, two of them—Texas sophomore Townley Haas and Indiana junior Blake Pieroni—own gold medals in freestyle relays from last year’s Rio Games.
In addition to proving his ability to compete against Olympic-caliber swimmers, Farris set new standards for Harvard swimming, breaking the school record in the 200 back prelims with a finish of 1:39.99. As a team, Farris’s performance in the 800 free relay helped to set a new school-record with a finish of 6:17.26, which earned him his third All-America honor.
“Huge shoutout to Dean for putting our team on the map and proving that you can do incredible things in the Ivy League,” senior Max Yakubovich said. “I’m glad I could finish out my last season with him.”
This championship meet simply topped off a remarkable season for the star freshman, which saw him deliver a nation-leading 200 free time during Ivy Championships as well as take home more All-America honors than any Harvard swimmer in the past seven years. The Crimson dominated the Ivy League, not only capturing the Ancient Eight championship but finishing the best among the Ivies at this year’s NCAA Championships, at 27th overall.
“Dean was great all year and he did what we all knew he was capable of doing,” sophomore Brennan Novak said. “I thought it was really impressive how he handled the pressure of coming into this meet as a freshman.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An impressive weekend for Harvard athletics saw outstanding performances from a number of athletes. Freshman Dean Farris of the men’s swimming and diving team and junior Merrick Madsen of the men’s hockey team were awarded co-Athletes of the Week recognition. However, Gabby Thomas of women’s track and field and Marisa Romeo of women’s lacrosse also had notable performances, earning them Athlete of the Week runners-up honors.
GABBY THOMAS, WOMEN’S TRACK AND FIELD
Saturday proved to be yet another distinguished day for sophomore sprinter Thomas at the Hurricane Collegiate Invitational, hosted by the University of Miami. The all-American placed first in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.34 seconds. Her time marked the fastest recorded in the East region for the event this season. It was also just four-hundredths of a second slower than her previous personal record in the event, which is a Harvard school record.
Not only did Thomas medal in the 100-meter, but she also played a record-setting role in the 4x400-meter relay. The Massachusetts native, along with teammates Jade Miller, Zoe Hughes, and Karina Joiner, placed fourth in the relay event. Their time of 3:42.12 was enough to break the top-10 for the fastest recorded times in school history.
Thomas also participated in the 4x100-meter relay with Miller, Joiner, and Ngozi Musa. The group set another school record with a time of 45.43 seconds. The time earned Thomas and the others sixth place and marked the third fastest time in the history of the Crimson’s program.
MARISA ROMEO, WOMEN’S LACROSSE
Senior attacker Romeo scored four goals in Saturday’s game to lead the Harvard women’s lacrosse team to a 10-8 victory over Cornell. Adding to her high-scoring act, Romeo had two assists on the day. The Syracuse native has now recorded 37 points and 27 goals on the season. Romeo’s strong performance this weekend also added the 10 assists she has put up in the first eight games of the season.
Romeo’s solid showing was also enough for her to pass Kaitlin Martin, class of 2009, on the Crimson’s all-time leading scorers list. Romeo is now ranked fourth with 141 career goals.

It’s a Friday night (or a Thursday night, if you’re particularly wild), and you’re ready to do things you’ll either regret or forget. No night out goes off without a hitch, though. Not only does Harvard have a complicated social scene, there’s always that one person who can turn a banger into a bummer. This one’s for those rude folks.
“Sorry, we’re at capacity.”
You yourself know this is the biggest lie you’ve ever told. Your frat house is barely full and the party’s only just started, but the bros left you in charge of weeding out the girls who aren’t hot enough and actually go here instead of Wellesley. You figure this is the nicest way to put it. Hint: We see right through you and your boat shoes.
The Elbows and Knees Dancer
We’ll say this as gently as we can. You are a danger to everyone around you. Whether it’s your flailing arms or your ponytail whipping around, your moves are this close to taking someone’s eye out. No matter how much you love to pop and lock and jam, you really have to rein it in. Or take it to a corner of the party.
The 2 a.m. Party ‘Source’
You assure the handful of people around you that you know where to go despite the fact that most parties are winding down. And then...you lead them on a wild goose chase that’s a FOP-level trek through Cambridge before finally saying the party’s ‘over.’ What’s that, you say? You’re sorry? Tell that to all the people who followed you in high-heeled shoes.
The Ambiguous Boston-Area Student
You loiter by a side door to Adams and wait for someone to swipe you in. You refer to the Quad by its street address—where the heck is Linnaean Street? But we don’t fault you for that. You’re the one who does all the rude things on this list in addition to not even going here, and then you complain—in clear earshot of Harvard students—about how bad the parties here are. Yeah, the door’s that way, buddy!
Odds are you’ve been a victim of at least one of these churls. But if you recognize yourself in any of these behaviors, let us be hopefully the last to tell you: Dude, that's rude.

If you’re reading this it’s too late, but Vince Staples came to give a talk at Harvard Tuesday afternoon. The 23 year-old rapper was invited to campus by the Black Men's Forum to give a talk with David Wall Rice, a professor and chair of the Department of Psychology at Morehouse College. Don't fret if you missed it—Flyby was there to cover it for you. Or actually, do fret. You freaking missed Vince Staples.
The Rundown: Wait, what was this?
So the event consisted of two main parts: a conversation between Staples and Rice and a Q&A with the audience. Overall, it was about an hour and a half of everyone in the room realizing that Vince Staples was smarter than them. The majority of the time Vince told his story of growing up in Long Beach, California and what led him to create his art.
Quotables: So what did he say?
Dude is seriously smart. His answers sounded like the perfectly constructed answers you think you’re giving in class, but, for you, it turns out sounding like flowery crap. Peep the examples below:
“They’re not buying music at this point. They’re buying ideas and identities.”Think about this the next time you say, “Omg. This [insert SUPER generic artist] just gets me, you know.” Also, think about this the next time you’re tryna be fake deep about some lyrics.
“A lot of times we’re running from as we’re running to.”Staples said this in reference to his choice to actively never forget when he came from. This is the type of stuff that makes you introspective af. And here you are having a Jaden Smith moment. You’re probably gonna use this as an insta caption.
“The hardest thing is getting someone to look themselves in the mirror, to face their own identity.”Now, listen. Think about your life. Think about all the things you’ve ever said. Do you think that you could ever say something this profound? The answer is no, you couldn’t. And he’s 23. When you’re 23, you can but hope to be a functional alcoholic realizing ~the real world~ can’t support your college drinking habits.
Final ThoughtsVince Staples is better than you, and us. If you already listen to his music, great. If you don’t, start with “Norf Norf” or “BagBak.” You’re welcome in advance.
