After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard women’s water polo team played only six games at home this season, it is fair to say that those six games were the defining points of the year. Clear-cut victories, comebacks that fell short, strong freshman play and intra-league troubles characteristic of the 2009 campaign all occurred within the confines of Blodgett Pool through the course of six games.The Crimson witnessed a slight decline this season as compared to last year, putting forth a 10-14 record after breaking even at 12-12 in 2008. Despite the slight difference in records, co-captain Devon MacLaughlin is proud of the season her team produced. “We ended the season much better than we have in the past by making [Eastern Championships] and winning a game,” MacLaughlin said. “We also played a much harder schedule this year.”The team fell just short in several of its losses, with only six defeats—all to opponents receiving votes in the national poll—decided by more than five points. Harvard had difficulty coming out strong and was often forced to overcome a deficit in the second half.Beginning its season at home with a 10-6 victory over the New York Athletic Club as part of the Harvard Invitational, the Crimson ultimately split the four games of its season-opening tournament and would close out its home schedule later in April with losses to Hartwick and Brown. Next competing in the Princeton and Elite Six Tournament at Bucknell, Harvard came out of the tournaments with a 5-6 record, including two frustrating losses to Princeton.Regular season play occurred mostly in Connecticut, New York and California. On the West Coast, the Crimson experienced its toughest loss, a 20-2 rout by then-No. 1 Stanford, and greatest victory at the time–a 17-10 triumph over Cal State Monterey Bay.Harvard returned to the East Coast to compete in the Northern Division Championships, in which the Crimson fell to Hartwick and Brown before crushing Utica and Connecticut College. The two latter teams were no match for Harvard throughout the season; in four matchups with the divisional opponents, the Crimson won by a combined 68 points. The Crimson finished in the middle of the pack of the CPWA North behind archrival Brown. In three encounters with the Bears, Harvard dropped all of its matchups by a combined three points with one of the games going into overtime.  “Those games were the most heartbreaking,” freshman Devan Kennifer said. “It’s good that they were close but I felt like we could have come out on top in at least two out of three of those.”Squeaking into the Harvard-hosted Eastern Championships as the eighth seed, the Crimson dropped its first two games against Hartwick and Indiana before winning its final contest of the season against Bucknell to determine seventh place. “It was also exciting for us to finish out on a win, especially in our home pool,” MacLaughlin said.Anchored by the two co-captains, the team relied heavily on its numerous freshmen in the pool. Kennifer often led the charge from center, backed by classmates Monica Zdrojewski, Shannon Purcell, Ita Barton-Kettleborough and Lizzie Abbott. Kennifer led the team in scoring and was deemed Rookie of the Year by her team and the CWPA North division.  Next year Harvard will look to its core of rising sophomores to set a new tone for the team, both at home in Blodgett and away in foreign waters. —Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Testimony from three individuals revealed Friday that Chanequa N. Campbell ’09—the student Harvard barred from graduation after a deadly shooting in Kirkland House last week—was the subject of a serious disciplinary investigation by the College in her freshman year. 
In 2005, Campbell was brought before the Administrative Board, the College’s chief disciplinary body, for allegedly stealing a blank check, making it out to herself, and redeeming the check for $300, according to the three individuals, who asked that they not be identified because they don’t want their names tied to the story. 
It is not clear what, if any, punishment Campbell received at the time of the incident. For their part, several of Campbell’s friends have said that it was unlikely that she would be involved with any criminal activity. 
Campbell allegedly stole the check at a party for a campus publication, two of the individuals indicated. Later, the student whose check she allegedly forged noticed that the handwriting was not theirs, and because Campbell had allegedly written the check to herself, the guilty party was easily identified, the individuals said. Campbell was not originally known to the person who had the check stolen, according to two individuals.
Campbell was then reported to the Ad Board, said the individuals, who added that Campbell defended herself after the incident by saying she needed the $300 for dental work.
In recent weeks, Campbell has told multiple media outlets that Harvard’s decision to bar her from graduation was unfounded and motivated by bias. While she is not making an “overall claim of racism,” she told The Globe, “I do believe I am being singled out...I’m black and I’m poor and I’m from New York and I walk a certain way and I keep my clothes a certain way,” she said. “It’s something that labels me as different from everyone else.”
Citing policy prohibiting comment on disciplinary matters involving individual students, administrators have declined to comment on Campbell—making it difficult to put together a cohesive picture of the record of the woman who claimed recently to the New York Post that she has been “scapegoated” and “can’t defend [herself].”
Repeated requests for an interview with Campbell through her lawyer Jeffrey T. Karp were denied. Karp did not respond to a request for comment on this story Friday night. 
Friends of Campbell have come to her defense in the past week.
“She has had a difficult upbringing. She came from a very tough neighborhood in Brooklyn,” said a friend who did not want to be identified because he did not think Campbell would want her personal details exposed. “People are trying to paint her in a certain light,” the friend said. “I think that people want to put her in this archetype role of somebody who’s from the ghetto.” 
Friends say Campbell is an accessible, social person.
“You could be in conversation with Chanequa and it would be broken up five or six times in one street because everyone loves Chanequa,” said Jonah C. Priour ’09, who said they “spent a good amount of time” together freshman year and “kept in touch over the years.”
“I think what sort of distinguished Chanequa for me was that I always left conversations with her with a new insight because she had such a wise perspective about the world,” Priour said. “We spent a lot of time having intellectual conversations in the middle of the night or during the day, too.”
Campbell, who is from New York City, was involved in “Prep for Prep,” a program that prepares minority students for private schools. The program sends many students to prestigious colleges and universities across the country. Campbell was also a New York Times Scholar. 
“She got into pretty much every school that she applied to,” said William Wong, Campbell’s friend from the program, who attends Yale. “She’s very, very good academically and really smart.”
Campbell comes from a single-parent home and has a large extended family, according to Wong.
William J. Houghteling ’09 lived in Campbell's entryway in Canaday freshman year. He said he and Campbell sent Internet messages to each other, then later Campbell knocked on his door. “I put my hand out to give [her] a handshake and she says, ‘Come on man, I already know you, and gives me a big hug,’” he said.
Friends said they were shocked to hear that Campbell had been asked to leave campus and tied to the drug related shooting.
“It’s shocking to hear Harvard wasn’t going to let her walk with the graduating class,” said Wong, her friend of 10 years. “It’s definitely shocking she was mixed up in something like this.”
Priour said he was also surprised to hear Campbell was allegedly involved.
“I was honestly a bit shocked to hear some of the connections that were being said to [exist] between her and anything causing anyone harm,” he said. “Because, I don’t know, she’s always been sort of very ladylike, very conscientious, very sweet, and she always thought of others.”
Christian B. Flow and June Q. Wu contributed to the reporting of this story.
—Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.eduREDACTION AND CLARIFICATIONAn earlier online version of the article contained information about one individual's relationship to Campbell that violated a source agreement. It has since been redacted.The same version incorrectly implied that only students of African American or Latino descent qualify for "Prep for Prep." In fact, some programs accept students of Asian-American descent as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Decade-long drought. 10-game winning streak. Star point guard. 
Oh, and add to the list the fact that the Harvard men’s basketball team had never won against a ranked opponent since its inception in 1900. 
There were a number of reasons why it should not have happened.
But none of those reasons seemed to matter on Jan. 7, when the Crimson bested then-No. 17 Boston College in Chestnut Hill. 
Perhaps BC is not the first school brought up when discussion arises on men’s college basketball. The Eagles are not a household name like Duke, nor a decorated squad like UCLA, with scores of banners and retired jerseys hanging from the gymnasium rafters. 
But just three days before, the Eagles had crushed one such team. In fact, the top team in the country at the time: North Carolina. 
The transitive property does not quite hold true when discussing wins, rankings, and team prowess, but that 85-78 destruction of the future NCAA Division I champs instilled confidence in BC. Led by offensive expert Tyrese Rice, who dropped 25 points on the Tar Heels, the Eagles were impervious in their previous 10 home games and boasted a 13-2 overall record before facing the easy-to-overlook, 7-6 Crimson, which had not beaten BC since before the turn of the millennium.
Harvard embraced the Eagle pride.
“It was the perfect time to play Boston College given what they had just accomplished,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “This was an opportunity if there was ever a time to play them since they were still riding high from that victory. If there’s anything that’s going to happen, this was probably going to be one of those moments.”
At the center of that storm which beset Conte Forum was junior guard Jeremy Lin. Assigned to defend the highly-touted Rice, Lin stole the spotlight for a night. Scoring 27 points, dishing out eight assists to two turnovers and generating six steals, Lin clipped his fair share of feathers, while the All-American Rice contributed a mere 14 points.
Lin’s rampage and Harvard’s shot at winning were not evident from the start. Despite opening with sloppy play and a shot that went off the side of the backboard, BC held a 17-11 advantage with 9:23 left in the first half. From there, Harvard began its steady takeover as the players and fans in gold and maroon looked on in disbelief. The Crimson took the lead with 7:32 to go in the first off of a three. There would not be another lead change.
“The most important thing is that you just have to respect every opponent you play, and when you don’t play, this is what happens,” BC coach Al Skinner said. “It creates a situation where you make yourself very susceptible.” 
The visiting team took advantage of that situation throughout the second half—Harvard shot 60.9 percent from the field as the Eagles’ defense stalled out. A Lin steal from Rice set the tone for the rest of the game, prompting a 9-4 Crimson run.
“Start building confidence, that’s the biggest segment of having a win like that,” Amaker said. “Our kids gained tremendous confidence as the game grew on...you could just feel and tell that it was just on our side that night.”
Lin’s supporting cast featured freshman Oliver McNally, who racked up 17 points and went 10-of-11 from the charity line, and captain Andrew Pusar, who put forth a then-season-high 13 points and valuable minutes. Down low, junior forward Doug Miller nabbed a career-high nine rebounds.
BC threatened to make several comebacks throughout the second but ultimately could not successfully sustain the effort. With a minute left and the score at 70-63, Rice seemed to wake up, nailing three consecutive free throws after scoring only three points in the first 36 minutes of play. 
With Rice actively scoring, foul shots became crucial for the Crimson in the waning moments of the game, but Harvard remained stalwart and made 10 of 12 free throws in the final minute of the contest.
As the clock ticked down to zero, the reality set in. An underdog Ivy League team had just overturned the high-flying Eagles, and did so in a double digit, 82-70 win. The Crimson topped a ranked team for the first time in its existence.
Drought ended, streak terminated, star player overcome. 
“Call it a layover, hangover, whatever phrases you want to use,” Amaker said. “It was not that they lost the game. We won the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The only player in Division I men’s basketball to rank among his league’s top 10 in every statistical category this year did not come from the ACC or the Big East. It was Harvard’s own Jeremy Lin, who has helped launch his name, as well as Crimson basketball, onto the national radar.
After a breakout season last year, the 6’2 guard took his game to another level in his junior campaign, which culminated in a first-team All-Ivy nod. A threat to score every time he touched the ball, Lin was a formidable offensive weapon in every facet of the game—from scoring in transition to dribble-drive penetration, not to mention deadly long-range shooting.
“He’s a great athlete, and he really worked on his shot a lot over the summer, and that got a lot better,” senior guard Drew Housman said.
While Lin’s team-leading 17.8 points and 4.3 assists per game were both among the top three in the Ancient Eight, his league-best 68 steals underline the star’s importance on the defensive end.
Most importantly, Lin stepped up when his team needed him the most. He put together a personal highlight reel against then-No. 17 Boston College, accumulating game-highs of 27 points, eight assists, a career-high six steals, and two blocks.
His team’s first option on every crucial possession, Lin often saved his best work for crunch time. Against Brown on Feb. 9, Lin hit a free throw with no time left on the clock to give Harvard a 64-63 home win, capping his 22-point second half.
In the Crimson’s first win at Penn in nearly two decades on Feb. 1, he poured in seven points during the game’s final 35 seconds, including a long three that broke a 58-58 tie.
And 15 of his game-high 19 points came in the final period in Harvard’s season finale against the Bulldogs, the team’s first win at Yale since the 1998-99 season. Fans at that game saw Lin become only the seventh player in Crimson basketball history to score his 1,000th point during his junior season.
Although his sophomore year performance, which garnered him second-team All-Ivy honors, was nothing to scoff at, a committed work ethic and Harvard’s improved play paid dividends this year for Lin.
“Our team had a much better year this past season, and I think that propelled Jeremy to new heights,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker wrote in an email.
Named co-captain by his teammates for the upcoming season, Lin will face a few challenges in his transition to a more visible leadership role, which will be particularly important for the highly-regarded incoming class of 2013 recruits.
“He’s definitely going to need to be more vocal,” Housman said. “He’s one of those quiet leader types, but once he’s the captain, he’s going to have to…let guys know what he wants them to do. It’ll be alright, because everyone’s going to listen to him, because he’ll be the best player.”
Regardless of Lin’s new title, the ultimate goal will be the same.
“As a leader and co-captain, Jeremy recognizes that the way for him to have the greatest impact at Harvard is for us to win,” Amaker wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What has been my favorite part of my four years on The Harvard Crimson? Besides the great people on The Crimson’s staff I have met, I also have had the opportunity to watch numerous Crimson sports games. I have listed below the five favorite games I had the pleasure of watching and reporting on.
GAME 5: WOMEN’S WATER POLO 6, BROWN 5, 4/23/06
Harvard’s archrival in women’s water polo is Brown, and the Crimson had fallen to its neighbors from the south the first three times they had met that season. But none of those games were as important as this one, taking place at the semifinals of the College Water Polo Association Northern Division Championships in Harvard’s own pool. The Crimson had to win to guarantee itself a spot at the Eastern Championships the next week, and if tensions were not high enough, Harvard had to live down losing its previous three meetings with the Bears, as well as having suffered a blowout by Hartwick the previous night. No matter, as the players overturned a 5-4 deficit with two goals early in the fourth quarter, then bolted the door on defense to hold on for the win. Crimson coach Erik Farrar was quite visibly pumped and was much more excited to talk about that game than he had been the previous night. No surprise there, as this was an exponentially more important contest, and the players performed appropriately.
GAME 4: SOFTBALL SWEEPS PENN 4-0, 4-2, 5/6/07
Upsets like water polo’s victory over Brown are thrilling, but not if you are rooting for the favorite. Instead, there can be just as much beauty in watching a team you support and expect to win go out and show its superior talent in bringing home victory. That is what the softball players did on their home field in the Ivy League Championship against the Quakers. Shelly Madick ’08 threw a no-hitter in the first game, then got the save in the second, shutting Penn down when it had the winning run at the plate in its last at-bat. Shortstop Lauren Brown ’07 provided the winning margin with a two-run homer in the fourth inning. The players and coach I interviewed afterward were so excited and happy that they thanked my fellow beat writer and me for our work throughout the year. In my experience, players and coaches, unsurprisingly, are better to talk to after a win than after a loss, so talking to them after they had just won a championship was fantastic.
GAME 3: MEN’S BASKETBALL 62, MICHIGAN 51, 12/1/07
This is the loudest crowd I have ever heard at a Harvard sporting event. The atmosphere rocked with a sizable number of Michigan fans and a student section that stood and screamed the entire game, resembling students at games in bigger and better conferences. An excellent performance on both ends saw the Crimson take each Wolverine blow in stride before scoring the final 11 points to win. Harvard students high on euphoria then stormed the court. Michigan may have been a terrible team in the Big 10 that year, but it still is a big-time program, and its visit to Lavietes Pavilion was a big deal.
GAME 2: MEN’S BASKETBALL 71, CORNELL 70, 2/28/09
Two years ago, Harvard beat Cornell at Lavietes with a last-second layup.  The next year, the Crimson gave the Big Red its toughest test in an undefeated league campaign before losing a five-point lead in the final half-minute. 
This time, in arguably the most gut-wrenching game I covered here, the Crimson did what it could not do a year ago. It finished the game, thanks to an excellent defensive effort that preserved a one-point lead against what was easily the best team in the league for the final 1:46 of the game, sending the boisterous Cornell fans home empty-handed and silent. 

GAME 1: BASKETBALL 82, BOSTON COLLEGE 70, 1/7/09
As a fan of Boston College basketball, I was quite excited by the chance to watch that team play up close as it hosted Harvard. As the game went on, my excitement grew. The Crimson was not playing the traditional role of a mid-major visiting a big conference team and getting blown out.
It grabbed a lead by halftime, then kept the distance throughout the second half with tremendous offensive execution and tenacious defense. Junior Jeremy Lin, the best player on the court that night, fouled out with time winding down and the game in hand. He left to rousing applause from the Boston College fans, an acknowledgment of not just his amazing feats, but the entire team’s. That day was truly amazing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into the spring season, most people expected the Harvard men’s volleyball team (11-8, 6-2 EIVA Hay Division) to win a couple more games than it did a year before.
Just being able to tack on a few more in the win column would have certainly been a step in the right direction for first-year coach Brian Baise and his players. 
“When I took the job, I didn’t know how we were going to do, what sort of players I would have,” Baise said.
But the Crimson had loftier goals in mind.
Surprising even the most optimistic of supporters, it won a share of the division title and made its first appearance in the playoffs since the 2005 season, marking a significant turnaround in just one year.  
“I thought going into it that we were going to be a really strong team,” co-captain Brady Weissbourd said. “You can never really go into a season expecting to go into the playoffs, but we definitely knew that we were good enough and really wanted it.”
Despite a roster depleted by multiple injuries and the unexpected departure of freshman star Nicola Ivica, the scrappy Harvard team was able to defy the odds. The team relied on strong leadership from the upperclassmen—led by Weissbourd and junior co-captain Gil Weintraub. 
“The leadership of the upperclassmen made it really easy for the freshmen to come into this team and play an important role,” Baise said. “The team was very supportive of each other, very demanding of each other, expected to play hard and play well.”
With its record at .500 after four games, Harvard faced its toughest stretch of the season as it traveled to play two difficult road games against defending national champion Penn State and league rival East Stroudsburg on consecutive days. 
But while the Crimson was intent on making its presence felt, the team flopped, hitting rock bottom as it fell, 3-0, in both matches. 
Just when it seemed like that nothing could have gone right for Harvard, the players began to come together as a team, gelling with each other off the court and passing the ball with confidence on it.
The Crimson won four of its next five games and nine of its next 11, including a thrilling victory against league rival Rutgers-Newark.
“We decided to practice harder and play harder, certainly not let that weekend get us down,” Baise said. “In some ways, that was clear on the bus ride home. We weren’t going to stay down for long.”
“After that weekend [against Penn State], we beat Rutgers-Newark in five, which really showed them that we could come together and compete with the best in our division,” Weissbourd added.
From then on, Harvard played like a team worthy of a league championship, using Weissbourd’s and freshman outside hitter Matt Jones’ hitting abilities to score, and juniors Soren Rosier and Erik Kuld’s prowess on the defensive end to block. 
“Because we have so few players, we really needed everybody to have a breakout season,” Weissbourd said, mentioning contributions from Kuld, sophomore Shaun Mansour, Jones, and freshman Dan Schreff. “I was really impressed with how everybody did having to be on their game all the time.”
While the Crimson fell in the first round of the playoffs to George Mason, 3-2, that Harvard was able to persevere and win a share of the league title is a testament to just how much it has achieved this season. 
For a volleyball program looking to achieve higher goals, there is no doubt that the foundation for its future has been set.
“We set our goals on winning the Hay Division,” Baise said. “I think the fact that we got a share of the title is really great.”

Coach Brian Baise watches every Harvard men’s volleyball game from his courtside seat with a cool demeanor, rarely showing emotion at any moment in the game. 
But underneath this collected appearance is a volleyball mastermind hard at work, analyzing every intricate detail of the match from player matchups to defensive strategy. 
In just his first season as the head coach of the Crimson, Baise has brought a renewed sense of enthusiasm and commitment to the program.
And though Baise used players recruited by his predecessor, he had no problem convincing these athletes to buy into his system. 
“I’ve had three coaches in the last four years, and Coach Baise really came in as a new coach really wanting to be in this for the long run and establish a strong program, which was something that we’ve been missing,” co-captain Brady Weissbourd said. “He’s extremely organized and dedicated.”
Baise brought his coaching expertise from Berkeley, where he successfully led the Cal club team to the quarterfinals of the 2000 National Intramural Recreational Sports Association Championships.
Additionally, Baise played his college ball at Princeton, where he realized that excellence in both academics and athletics is possible. 
“Going through that program helped me understand what was needed to coach at a school like Harvard,” Baise said. “Those experiences were my foundations as a coach.”
Seemingly the perfect fit for the Crimson, Baise got down to business with his players from the very first practice, emphasizing that hard work would be the key to success.
As the soft-spoken coach demonstrated a firm commitment to the achievements of his players both on and off the court, his advice began to resonate with them. 
“[Coach Baise] emphasized that the only way to get better is to push yourself and make yourself better,” Weissbourd said. “It’s not going to happen naturally; without everyone focusing on making themselves better, you’re not going to make the team better.”
Despite lacking enough players to form two scrimmage squads during practice, Baise still managed to create intense sessions for his players to emphasize his doctrine. 
“To go through an entire year without having a single scrimmage is extremely difficult,” Baise said. “Practices need to have some real competition and momentum. You have to practice the intensity level of games.”
“He made every practice challenging and as competitive as possible,” Weissbourd added.
The hard work put into the season by both coach and players paid off, as Harvard earned a share of the EIVA Hay Division title, going 6-2 in conference play while defeating league foes East Stroudsburg, NYU, and Rutgers-Newark along the way. Topping it all off for the turnaround effort was the Crimson’s first appearance in the playoffs since the 2004-05 season.
Without a doubt, Baise has made an instant impact on the volleyball program. If his first-season success proves to be any indication of just how much Baise can achieve as a coach, it could be only a matter of time before Harvard solidifies its status as one of the premier programs in the league.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard women’s volleyball team, it was a season of impressive accomplishments juxtaposed with frustrating defeats. It was a combination of epic comebacks and dropped leads. It was a season of opposites that balanced out to a 10-16 record and hopes for next season.
The Crimson closed out the 2008 campaign fifth in the Ivy League, having gone 5-9 against conference opponents. Harvard had difficulty dealing with the likes of Yale, Cornell, Penn, and Princeton, and was unable to defeat these Ivy League opponents despite coming close on several occasions. But Harvard easily handled Dartmouth and Columbia, sweeping both matchups over the course of the season.
Senior Kathryn McKinley set the offensive rhythm for the Crimson, ranking first on the team in kills at 327. McKinley played in all 97 of Harvard’s games, and the statistical pinnacle of her play came on Oct. 10 and 11 at Brown and Yale, when the senior racked up a combined 46 kills and 39 digs. But despite McKinley’s efforts, Harvard fell in both games.
In addition to the team’s seniors, junior co-captains Katherine Kocurek and Lily Durwood excelled this season. Durwood tossed up 1034 assists, good for second in the conference, while Kocurek focused on the defensive elements of the game and registered 348 digs.
“We were the strongest we’ve been since I’ve been playing Harvard volleyball,” Kocurek said.   
Prior to Ancient Eight competition, the Crimson witnessed mixed results. Competing in assorted non-conference matchups and three invitationals, Harvard entered the Ivy season with a 7-7 record and a six-game win streak. It could not handle then-No. 22 Long Beach State, losing three games in a row at home, but took control several weeks later to win the Dartmouth Invitational.
Prominent accomplishments this season included coach Jennifer Weiss’ 200th career victory, Kocurek and McKinley’s 1000th career digs and freshman Anne Carroll Ingersoll’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors.  
The Crimson also displayed its resilience, earning several victories with substantial comebacks—including its 3-2 decision over New Hampshire early in the season. Down 24-11 in the second set, Harvard rallied and put up 13 straight points to tie the game and set up the victory. Although the Wildcats grabbed the next two sets, the Crimson reestablished dominance in the fifth to emerge victorious.
But the marathon matchup against New Hampshire was the only five-game match that the Crimson won all year. Harvard struggled to finish strong in contests that extended beyond four games, losing five such matches throughout the season. Shorter matches went both ways—the Crimson posted six shutouts and was held winless in seven confrontations.
“When it’s five games and 25 points, you really can’t tell by looking at the score,” McKinley said. “We fought for every point.”
Although McKinley graduates this year, Harvard can look forward to the return of several rising sophomores in addition to Ingersoll—Christine Wu and Sandra Lynne Fryhofer. Each will provide valuable talent in different areas of the court. Wu led the team in digs with 378 and was sixth overall in the Ivy League in the category. Playing in 21 matches, Fryhofer dropped 40 blocks on opposing teams while racking up 143 kills, finishing third and fourth on the team in those statistics, respectively.
“Each of the freshmen has their own personality—strong, reassuring, constantly supportive, or just them tearing it up,” McKinley said.
Next year the Crimson will look to its rising sophomores and incoming co-captains Chelsea Ono Horn and Miyoko Pettit, a rising senior and junior, respectively, to shift the balance towards the win column.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team made significant progress this year, finishing with a winning record for the first time since 2004 and ending the season with an 8-5 record—3-3 in the Ivy slate.
The Harvard men set the bar high for next year, beating a top-10 opponent for the first time under head coach John Tillman. But a handful of one-goal losses denied the Crimson the chance to vie for the Ivy League title and kept them from postseason play.
“We made great strides for the program,” said senior co-captain Nick Smith, who led Harvard with 55 ground balls on the season. “We didn’t reach all the goals that we wanted to reach, but I think the senior class can’t be too unhappy with the legacy that they left.”
The Crimson began its season with a bang, pulling out a huge 9-6 upset over then-No. 5 Duke. Freshman Jeff Cohen also made his debut, breaking out onto the collegiate lacrosse scene with a hat trick.
“It certainly set the tone and set the bar high for our season,” co-captain Max Motschwiller said. “[After Duke] we knew that we had the potential to beat any team, but when we came up short in those one-goal games it was pretty upsetting.”
Harvard followed this victory with another confidence booster, thrashing Stony Brook, 12-4, on the Seawolves’ home turf. Recovering from an illness that kept him out of the Duke game, sophomore standout Dean Gibbons returned with a vengeance, finding the Stony Brook net four times. Senior Eric Posner also led the Crimson defensively, picking up four ground balls.
In the team’s home opener, UMass handed No. 11 Harvard its first loss of the season, ending its non-conference winning streak. The Crimson bounced back in its next two matchups, trouncing Hartford and Penn, 18-7 and 11-4, respectively.
But as March ended, so did Harvard’s lacrosse honeymoon. In a crushing defeat, Georgetown squeaked past the Crimson, 9-8, with an early overtime goal.
Suffering from a one-goal deficit would become the rule rather than the exception for Harvard. After briefly recovering with a 17-2 destruction of Presbyterian, the Crimson suffered a three-game losing streak that would effectively dash its hopes for an NCAA playoff berth.
Although senior goaltender Joe Pike made 14 saves on the day, then-No. 3 Cornell was able to overwhelm Harvard, 13-12. The following week, then-No. 2 Princeton handed the Crimson another one-goal defeat. The Tigers sealed Harvard’s fate with an unassisted goal with two minutes to play, giving the Crimson a 10-9 loss. Brown followed suit the next week, defeating Harvard, 8-6.
These three loses proved to be too much for the Crimson to overcome, keeping them from this year’s NCAA tournament and the Ivy title.
But Harvard bounced back, finishing up its season with three straight victories. The Crimson sped past Holy Cross, Yale and Dartmouth, with 11-4, 13-8, and 8-5 wins, respectively.
“In our last couple of games, we just went out and played,” Motschwiller said. “The biggest overall improvement is we just played more as a team as the season went on.”
Although Harvard wasn’t able to accomplish all of its goals for the season, the Crimson men made great strides in improving a program with a less-than-stellar record. The senior class leaves behind a team that can draw on support from each other and from its alumni.
“I’m really excited, now that I am an [alumnus], that the alumni are invigorated about the program,” Smith said. “I hope that continues.”
Harvard will look to continue on its path back to the top of the Ivy League in the upcoming seasons, with its graduated seniors keeping a close eye on their team’s improvement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team finished its roller coaster of a season with a bang. 
The Crimson, ending with a 6-10 overall record (2-5 Ivy), waited until only one second remained in the final game of its season to pull out its last win, as freshman Katie Doherty found the back of the net for a 9-8 victory over Boston College.
“We definitely improved throughout the season, and I am looking forward to picking up where we left off next fall,” freshman attacker Tyler Petropulos said.
An early surge for Harvard opened the campaign with confidence, as the Crimson beat Holy Cross and Quinnipiac in two of its first three games. But Harvard faced some tough luck, falling to UMass by only one goal in the last minutes and New Hampshire in overtime.
Despite the rough patch that Harvard hit midseason with a five-game losing streak, the Crimson players held their heads up and continued to push through until the last minutes of their season.
“One of our strengths was not giving up by the end of the season,” junior tri-captain Sara Flood said. “By the last few games, we knew we wouldn’t make it to the tournament, but we still fought for some wins.”
Harvard’s final Ivy League game against nationally-ranked Cornell showed the true character of the Crimson. 
Harvard came out as a formidable opponent, proving that its ranking and record were not a true reflection of its talent and beating the Big Red, 11-7.
“Our game against Cornell was definitely our most memorable game of the season,” Petropulos said. “We came together and really played like a team. Plus, we knocked off a ranked opponent, which was the best way to close out our Ivy League schedule.”
“We played hard for 60 minutes and everyone did their job,” Flood said. “At the end of the game, you could see in everyone’s faces how good it felt to just get the job done, especially against an Ivy competitor.”
Harvard’s season was marked by impressive individual performances. Sophomore Jess Halpern—who led the Crimson in goals this season with 46—and Petropulos were named to the women’s lacrosse All-Ivy League team. 
“As someone new to this team, the best thing about our season is knowing that we are only going to get better and more competitive next year.” Petropulos said.
Harvard’s team, consisting of only 19 players this spring, relied on each and every member to make an impact on the field. 
Senior Kaitlin Martin was a close runner-up behind Halpern in the goal count, tallying 39. Flood scored 21 goals alongside her 16 assists this season. Junior Delia Pais led the defense throughout the season, picking up 29 ground balls this spring. 
“We are just going to keep chipping away and focusing on the little things, which we hope will get us to the next level,” Petropulos said.
Overall, Harvard was not pleased with its record, but the Crimson is optimistic about its future. With a powerful incoming class and a strong backbone of players that remain, Harvard may be a fearsome opponent in the upcoming years.
“Next year we have nine solid freshmen coming in,” Flood said. “I think we need to get right to work when we get back to school so that we can be as prepared as possible come Feb. 1. During season I think we have to remember how important every single game is and focus on practice every day in order to get the job done come game time.”

If he can replicate the success of his freshman year, Jeff Cohen’s name could become a verb. This season alone, opposing goalies were owned, pwnd, and Cohened 34 times. 
It is no coincidence that Cohen’s arrival coincided with the best season in the last 10 years for Harvard men’s lacrosse. The freshman’s 34 scores were the most ever for a Crimson rookie, and the ninth-highest single-season total in Harvard history. His 2.62 goals per game placed him third in the conference and eighth in the nation in scoring.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” co-captain Nick Smith said. “He’s not the best athlete out there by any standard…He’s slower and not as strong as most of the guys he’s playing with, but because he’s so lacrosse savvy, he’s scoring five or six goals against the best teams in the country.”
With Cohen’s gaudy statistics came numerous accolades. He was honored three times as the Ivy League Rookie of the Week, twice as the NEILA Rookie of the Week, and once as the NEILA Player of the Week. At the end of the season, he was named the NEILA Rookie of the Year and an All-Ivy honorable mention.
Cohen’s arrival in Cambridge had been in the making for a number of years. His older brothers Steve ’06 and Greg ’07 played lacrosse for the Crimson, and watching them play in the stony confines of Harvard Stadium made quite an impression on the younger sibling.
“I always knew this was the place for me,” Cohen said. “I remember coming to games when I was a teenager, sitting in the stands and…feeling like I was almost part of the team.”
Before he put on a Harvard uniform, Cohen rewrote the Long Island high school record books. In the lacrosse hotbed, he scored a record 260 goals and was a two-time All-American. With these accomplishments preceding him, Cohen entered his first season with lofty expectations.
“I definitely put pretty high expectations on myself,” the freshman said. “The coaches put high expectations on me too. I always considered myself a goal-scorer—it’s what I did a lot of when I played in high school. So I knew when the coaches gave me my opportunity to get in there, I was going to score goals.”
Any concerns about Cohen’s ability to succeed at the college level were assuaged in the Crimson’s first game of the season.  
Harvard opened the spring in Durham, N.C. against traditional powerhouse Duke. With sophomore attacker Dean Gibbons sidelined by illness, Cohen got the starting nod against the No. 5 Blue Devils, and immediately made his presence felt. 
“Maybe if [Gibbons] hadn’t gotten sick I wouldn’t have had as many opportunities in that game, and I wouldn’t have gotten the confidence,” Cohen said.
The freshman notched two goals in the second period to give the Crimson a 2-1 lead, and tallied a third score in the second half as Harvard defeated Duke, 9-6. The win was the Crimson’s first victory over a top-10 team under current coach John Tillman.
“I remember after the game, that night being in [the] Durham airport,” Cohen recalled. “We got delayed for two hours, and we were all sitting there, getting phone calls from everyone we knew just saying, ‘Did you really beat Duke? Is that a joke?’” 
Cohen’s excellence persisted throughout the season, and he improved as the year wore on. He scored five goals in a blowout against Hartford, four goals in a heartbreaking loss to then-No. 3 Cornell, and six goals in a win over Holy Cross. In total, Cohen recorded six hat tricks, including three in a row to close out the season. 
“He’s a great finisher, one of the best I’ve ever seen,” co-captain Max Motschwiller said.
Cohen’s prolific scoring helped               	Harvard to its best season in a decade. The Crimson went 8-5 overall and 3-3 in the Ivy League, narrowly missing an at-large berth to the NCAA tournament.
“Jeff was awesome,” Motschwiller said. “Coming in his freshman year and having the season he had, he was so important to our team.”
With his freshman season under his belt, Cohen is determined avoid a sophomore slump next year as Harvard’s rising lacrosse program continues to develop. 
“[The coaches] told me I’m going to have to step up and be a leader,” Cohen said. “I’m not going to be able to surprise teams anymore. I need to be able to adapt and make myself better.”

It was the first Ivy League game of the season, and the Harvard women’s soccer team was rolling with a six-game unbeaten streak, including a 1-1 tie against then-No. 12 Boston College. After having played a grueling nine games in 22 days, the Crimson players were optimistic about their ability to succeed. But with missed shots—including a close attempt from freshman Melanie Baskind that deflected off the crossbar—and Penn finding the net once in each half, the Harvard team emerged from the game in a completely different mood. “It was our first Ivy League game, and we lost it,” junior Christina Hagner said. “After that game, we got together because people’s heads were down, worrying, ‘What does this mean for the season?’”Seven wins and one tie later, the Crimson’s worries had disappeared. Playing against Columbia in the season finale on Nov. 8, junior defenseman Lizzy Nichols scored on a penalty kick with nine seconds left on the clock in double overtime to give Harvard a 2-1 win and clinch the Ivy League title—and the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament that comes with it. “It’s kind of amazing,” junior goaltender Lauren Mann said. “[Winning an] Ivy League championship is something that every Ivy League team strives to do, so the fact that we did it, it was a great day.”What was the secret to such success? According to Harvard head coach Ray Leone, who in his two years at the helm has led the Crimson to as many 10-win seasons, it’s that the team had fun. “I think what they took out of it is that when they truly play for fun and compete as hard as they can, they can really accomplish anything,” he said. “When they just think of the result, they don’t do as well—like when we played Penn. In some respects, [after the Penn game] the pressure was off, and we just quietly made our journey to the top.”A month after the disappointment in Pennsylvania, the team proved its coach was right on an away trip to Princeton. “Our game against Princeton was ridiculous,” Hagner said. “The game was delayed because of lightning, and halfway through, there was a torrential downpour. We had to leave the field, but in the locker room the excitement and energy to go out and play was unreal. It speaks to the character of this team and how we just love playing the game and playing with each other.”Harvard eventually won the game, 2-1.“The team in the locker room was kind of insane,” Mann said. “We were very fired up. Everyone just wanted to get back on the field and continue playing and continue winning.”This formula of having fun while winning developed thanks to the leadership of the seniors. “To win the Ivy League Championship, you have to be quite resilient,” Leone said. “For us to have our seniors go from the experience of winning three games in their sophomore year to winning the Ivy League Championship their senior year, it just doesn’t get any better than that.” It was one of these seniors, in fact, who helped turn the team around after the tough loss at Penn.“One of our seniors, Rachael Lau, pulled us together and said, ‘Guys, wipe that look of doubt off your face. We can do this,’” Hagner said.  “I don’t think we lost after that point until Northeastern [in the NCAA tournament].” Finishing with a 10-3-5 record, 5-1-1 in the Ancient Eight, the Harvard women’s soccer team ended the year on top. The focus now is on maintaining that position next year.“The major thing is how do you handle success?” Leone said. “Now we are the marked one, and it’s much easier to be the chaser. We are talented enough to do it, so I just need to remind our team, and they need to remind each other, that what got us there was incredible, incredible determination, and I hope we can get that again.”—Staff writer Alex Sopko can be reached at sopko@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman sabre fencer Caroline Vloka has let the entire nation know that she is here to stay. Vloka capped off an impressive rookie season last March, finishing the NCAA tournament with a silver medal in the sabre, second in the nation to Duke freshman Becca Ward.As one of the most consistent fencers on the women’s team, Vloka participated in every match for the Crimson this year, guiding the team to a 20-1 overall record. Vloka, a stranger to defeat, finished with a perfect record in many key tournaments throughout the year. She went 12-0 in the second part of the Ivy Championships, 6-0 against defending national champion Ohio State and St. John’s, and 9-0 in the annual Beanpot tournament. This, along with various other stellar performances, places Vloka among the best fencers in the country.“After the first day [of NCAAs], when I saw I was in top four and had my tough bouts out of the way, I felt really confident and really happy with my fencing,” Vloka said. But when Vloka found out she would face Ward in the championship bout, she knew about her opponent’s past and how tough a first-place finish would be. The girls have fenced each other since the age of ten, and Vloka has never quite been able to show dominance over Ward. Because of this, Vloka found it was difficult to mentally prepare for the match. “I was really nervous and it really showed in my bout,” she said.Luckily, the rookie will have three more years to fight for the top spot in the country.“Caroline had a great year,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “She was a very good fencer on the junior level and has really been a tremendous competitor for our squad this year.”Vloka exited the preliminary rounds of the NCAA tournament with a 20-3 record and 105 touches. Her accomplishments in the tournament earned her first-team All-American and first-team All-Ivy League honors. Vloka ultimately fell to Ward, 15-4, in the final bout of her season.The rookie attributes much of her and the team’s success to chemistry. In a sport where individual accolades could easily override the unity of the team, the women’s squad was able to win many matches this year by members of the team winning key bouts at the right times. “I’m really happy I came into freshman year with this team,” Vloka said. “It helped to have someone to fall back on. We really clicked.”The women’s squad will lose a few key fencers to graduation next year, including co-captain Emily Cross and senior epee Maria Larsson. Vloka will now be asked to carry Harvard in a different way—as one of its leaders.“Both her and [classmate Noam Mills], unusually, as freshmen will be coming into their sophomore years as captains,” Brand said.—Staff writer Melissa Schellberg can be reached at mlschell@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a sport that on the surface seems to revolve around the individual, it’s hard to imagine how teamwork could have been essential to the success of the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team this year.
But at the Ivy League Championships, the Crimson showed just how important the team mentality can be in swimming. 
While three-time defending champion Princeton relied on the talent of a few superstar swimmers, Harvard used its impressive depth to decisively reclaim the title it last held in 2005.
“There is something very special about this team.” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said after Ivies. “They are very positive and work together. They mentor each other and support each other. On every little opportunity they rose up to the challenge. And all those little things together add up and make the difference.”
Though the Tigers won 10 events to Harvard’s six, more Crimson swimmers reached the A finals, making a championship victory nearly inevitable. 
“I think that what is really impressive is the way that everybody swam up to their potential and really exceeded our expectations,” junior co-captain Alexandra Clarke said. 
The focus on a group effort arose in practice and translated into success in competition.
“Even if someone was struggling, there was always someone to pull them up and not someone else to pull them down,” Morawski said. “And I think that is really important when you look at the strength of your team.”
Harvard rode that cooperative mentality to a phenomenal regular season, highlighted by nine school-record performances at the early-season Georgia Invitational, and six dominant Ivy League wins. 
And though the team effort fell short against Princeton in the HYP tri-meet, the swimmers never lost faith in each other.
“The big point that anyone who was watching the meet saw is that we were a team,” Morawski said after the meet. “If they were in a heat with their teammates, they worked with their teammates to touch them out and win. Swimming as fast as we did and staying that close to Princeton without getting the wins—that was the group effort.”
With the Ancient Eight crown on the line, the Crimson’s depth and cooperation came through. Led by its distance swimmers, four of whom placed in the top five in three events—including a 1-2-3 sweep of the 1000-yard freestyle—Harvard took the crown by a 249.5-point margin.
And fittingly, the Crimson capped the meet with two school records in the 400-yard and 800-yard freestyle relays, with the team taking home the title in the 800-yard distance.
“I had an amazing time watching all of my teammates succeed and swim incredibly fast,” sophomore Kate Mills wrote in an e-mail. “Our championship truly was a team effort. We always said that we were a special team, and in the end, we proved that we really were a special group of girls. I think that speaks to the atmosphere of our year.”

The Harvard women’s golf team found itself in an unusual position entering the 2008-09 season.After earning its first-ever Ancient Eight crown in its 2007-08 campaign, the Crimson became the hunted instead of the hunters as it looked to defend its title this year.Not only did Harvard respond by topping the Ivy League ranks for the second- consecutive year, the Crimson did so in unprecedented fashion, winning all but one of its tournaments along the way. Harvard placed second in its lone defeat of the year to Princeton, but quickly avenged the lone blemish on its schedule by besting the Tigers a week later at the Ivy League Championships.While there were likely many factors contributing to such a successful season for the Crimson, none was more important than the extra practice many team members put in throughout the year.“Each person on the team worked hard individually this season,” rookie Christine Cho said. “Even when we did not have team practice during the winter months, many of us would practice in our indoor facility, and this really helped us at the end of the year.”Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads also played a crucial role in preparing the girls throughout the season, which included victories at the Princeton Invitational and the Yale Fall Intercollegiate for the first time in Harvard history.“Coach Rhoads was great,” Cho said. “He is helpful when he needs to be, and lets us figure things out on our own when we should.”Despite the success the Crimson found during its regular season and throughout tournaments in the Northeast, Harvard was unable to improve on its 19th-place showing at the NCAA Regional Championship in early May.“[That] was a tough weekend for us,” departing senior Emily Balmert said. “We did not play as well as we would have liked or probably as well as we could have based on our performances this year. We are a little disappointed, but I don’t think [that] weekend can erase the strong year that we did have.”While the national tournament did not go as well as the Crimson would have liked, the fact that Harvard made the NCAA field for the second-consecutive year shows just how far this program has come. In the course of Coach Rhoads’ five seasons at the helm, the Crimson has won 20 tournaments—four times the number Harvard had won in the team’s entire history before Rhoads joined the program.As can be seen through its performances this year, the Crimson has risen to the top of the Northeast ranks in women’s golf and now looks to tackle tougher competition on the national scene.“We just need to keep doing what we have been doing,” Cho said. “If all of us had played the way we know we could have, we probably could have advanced at the national regional tournament this year. I am excited to see what we can do at that tournament next year, hopefully, if we qualify again.”With the way things went this season, the organizers of the NCAA Regionals may want to hold a spot for the Crimson at next year’s tournament.—Staff writer Thomas D.

For the 18 members of the Harvard men’s squash team, this season was nothing more than a rollercoaster ride.“Up and down,” junior Frank Cohen said. “We had a couple really good wins and had a couple very disappointing losses.”The Crimson began the season ranked No. 4 in the nation. Living up to expectations, the team started off with three straight home wins in late November, including a sound 9-0 crushing of then-No. 14 Brown and an 8-1 win over No. 10 Williams. With junior Colin West outscoring his three opponents 81-2 and crucial wins from the No. 5 and No. 9 spots, Harvard also grabbed a close 5-4 victory over No. 9 Dartmouth. The opposition only became more competitive as the team then faced No. 6 Cornell in Ithaca, receiving its first loss of the season at the hands of the Big Red, 3-6.“Our match against Cornell during the season, that was very disappointing to lose to those guys,” Cohen said. “They had never beaten us before.”Despite the letdown, Harvard bounced back with a 7-2 win that same day against No. 8 Western Ontario and followed it up with another close 5-4 win against a No. 5-ranked Rochester team a week later.“In the Rochester match, Colin [West] sort of expected a win, [senior Niko Hrdy] played a higher ranking, and [senior Verdi DiSesa] just had the match of his life to pull out a win for the team,” Cohen said. “We were the underdogs, so Rochester thought they could beat us, but those three guys just put it out of their minds.”The rest of the regular season consisted of two defeats by No. 1 Trinity and No. 2 Princeton. Harvard managed a close 5-4 win against Penn, but a tough 5-4 loss to Yale brought the team down a spot in the national poll.Going into the College Squash Association tournament, the main goal was to finish the year on a strong note, especially for the outgoing seniors.“There was a very strong senior presence so a lot of us really wanted to have a good season for them,” Cohen said. “We were all thinking that we would try to give them the season they deserve.”“It was hard to go from our freshman year when we won the Ivy League title [to this],” Hrdy added. “We lost to Cornell for the first time ever, and we lost to Rochester for the first time ever, so it was kind of a disappointment to finish off the senior season like this. But I think that we worked harder than the previous oh-so-talented teams.”The Crimson continued its ride of a season into the CSA tournament with a 5-4 win against Cornell. But two losses against Trinity and Rochester cost the team any form of a top-three medal.“Next year is going to be interesting,” Hrdy said. “I think the team has great leadership. Outside of that, I think kids are going to need to step up, especially with [team captain] Verdi and I leaving the No. 2 and 3 spots.”But Harvard has reason to be optimistic, with a handful of new recruits coming in and seven juniors stepping up to fill the leadership position that this year’s senior class will leave behind.“We are going to stress a lot of fitness, we are going to do a lot of match play, mental preparation,” said Cohen, who will be next year’s co-captain alongside West. “We are going to be ready for our season next year.”  —Staff writer Alex Sopko can be reached at sopko@fas.harvard.edu.

With a lopsided female lineup and a few tough losses early in the season for the men, a successful year was never a certainty for the nationally-contending Crimson. Yet with strong leadership from tri-captains Emily Cross, Kai Itameri-Kinter, and Benji Ungar, the Crimson worked its way up to finish fifth in the country for the Ivy League-champion women, and seventh for the men, who entered the tournament ranked 10th. Harvard ultimately sent nine individuals to the NCAA Tournament. “Our women were the stars this year,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “Overall, this was one of our best years since [the national championship in] ’06 because so many individuals made NCAAs. It was a stellar year for us.”Early in the season, Brand expressed concern for the lack of depth on his women’s squad, but was reassured early by Cross that the team would pull through and win the Ivy Championship. On paper, the Harvard lineup varied, with some of the best fencers in the country leading all three weapons but also including a few women with little collegiate experience. Brand attributed the success of the women’s team to Cross and her skills as a captain.“She was a tremendous leader for the women,” Brand said. “She didn’t just cheer, but helped coach the other women. She clearly was the premier leader on the women’s side.”The Crimson women (20-1) were able to shine the entire season, losing only one match to Penn State in early December. Cross finished her stellar collegiate career with a strong fight, losing a close 8-7 bout to the Nittany Lions’ Doris Willette and eventually claiming third place in the nation in the foil. Freshmen sabre Caroline Vloka and epee Noam Mills were also outstanding in their first year. Vloka finished second in the country in the sabre, notching a 21-4 record, and Mills followed suit with an astounding 22-3 season. In the tournament, Mills finished second overall in the epee. Brand describes Mills as one of the best fencers on the team.“She continues to work extremely hard, more than anyone else on the team,” Brand praised.Mills and Vloka capped off their amazing rookie campaigns by receiving first-team All-American honors. Joining them were Cross and senior epee Ungar.Ungar led the way for a men’s team (9-9) that finished the season on a high note, despite a few difficult losses. The tri-captain earned a third-place finish in the men’s epee and along with freshman sabre Valentin Staller—who had nine victories and 78 touches in the tournament for a 15th-place finish—propelled the men to seventh overall at NCAAs. At the NCAA Regionals, junior epee Karl Harmenberg mirrored his female counterpart Mills, as both took home the gold medal in the weapon. Senior Maria Larsson finished behind Mills in second.Other Crimson fencers who competed in the NCAA Tournament included freshman foil Shelby MacLeod and Larsson—both of whom finished 17th in their respective weapons—along with Itameri-Kinter, who finished 20th in the men’s foil, and Harmenberg, who finished 23rd.Although a far cry from a national championship, the Crimson made its way back to the highest echelon of American fencing this season, something that has been missing since 2006.“I’m really proud of the team in general,” Vloka said. “Everyone did a really amazing job.” Harvard will be put to the test next year after losing many key fencers to graduation, perhaps none more crucial than Cross. Still, with a few talented freshmen on its side, the Crimson should prove a fierce competitor both in the Ivy League and nationally.—Staff writer Melissa Schellberg can be reached at mlschell@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A season that started out with promise and tough expectations saw a team blossom into a true national power, full of potential for seasons to come. The Harvard women’s squash team put together a highly successful campaign, finishing with a 10-2 record and a No. 2 ranking in the nation. Both losses came at the hands of No. 1 Princeton in close 5-4 meetings, including a highly-contested matchup for the national title. The Crimson started out the season with a winning run, blanking its first three opponents, 9-0, and beating the next four by wide margins. Harvard did not lose a single game in its opening match against Brown, shutting down all of the Bears in 3-0 contests. A sweep of Williams earned the Crimson a No. 4 ranking in its next matchup against No. 8 Dartmouth, who fell by the same 9-0 score.Harvard then hit the road to face No. 7 Cornell and No. 6 Stanford. The Crimson beat them both, 8-1, proving worthy itself of its top-four ranking. Harvard’s first real tests came in the first week of February against three opponents that were seeded higher than the Crimson. “We knew that we were strong going into that week, but we knew [Trinity, Penn, and Princeton] were going to be tough,” junior captain Johanna Snyder said. “It was [a] hybrid of confidence and viewing them as true competition that made us successful.” The Crimson impressed in every way possible against No. 3 Trinity. Seven out of the nine matches went past three games, but Harvard’s young talent came out on top, 7-2. Harvard rose to No. 3 in the country, and had a chance to prove itself once again against No. 2 Penn three days later. The Crimson rose one more spot in the rankings with another 7-2 victory. The final test of the week came the next day, when No. 2 Harvard traveled to New Jersey in a marquee matchup against the top program in the nation. The Crimson had momentum on its side, but Princeton stopped the team in its tracks. The Tigers won five out of the nine matches in an intense encounter that would be echoed again later in the national championship match. No. 5 Yale gave Harvard another chance to pick up where it left off. The Crimson beat the Bulldogs, 6-3, in the final match of the season and solidified its No. 2 ranking going into the CSA National Team Championships. The team breezed through its early matches with Stanford and Penn, setting up a highly-anticipated rematch with Princeton.Going for its 13th national title, the Crimson sought to upset the Tigers in the championship match. Harvard was able to win in the No. 5 and No. 6 slots, but five hard-fought losses forced the Crimson to settle for second place. Harvard was able to gain two victories at the No. 4 and No. 7 slots to attenuate the loss, 5-4. The Crimson capped off the season by sending junior Catherine O’Donnell, sophomore Alisha Mashruwala, and freshmen Emily Park and Nirasha Guruge to the CSA Individual Championships. Guruge was the most successful in the tournament, ranked at No. 7 and falling in the quaterfinals to the No. 2 seed. Snyder won the Holleran Cup—the “B” bracket of the CSA tournament. Five All-Americans were selected from Harvard’s squad, and Guruge became the third Crimson player in the past four years to be named Ivy League Rookie of the Year, making this season one of the most memorable for women’s squash. With no seniors lost from this season, Harvard is poised to make a serious run at the national title next year.  “Next year we’re bringing in five new freshmen, and the team has three juniors that have two championship game appearances,” O’Donnell said. “We definitely have experience and its great preparation for the next year.”—Staff writer Brian A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are some things Harvard students have come to expect in the month of May: improved weather, online TV episodes during reading period, and lots of e-mail spam regarding senior sales. One thing that should be added to this list of May mainstays is the presence of the Harvard sailing team in national championship regattas. After the women’s squad’s one-year hiatus from the national championship, the Crimson’s co-ed and women’s teams qualified for all three of their national affairs, with the contests taking place in the windy waters of San Francisco, Calif. “It is our goal to qualify for all three of the national championships every year,” senior skipper Jon Garrity said. The women’s squad finished its season with a 10th-place effort at the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association Women’s National Championship from May 25-27. The co-ed squad competed in the ICSA Team Race National Championship from May 29-31 and the ICSA/Gill National Dinghy Championship from June 1-3. The women’s squad was led throughout this season by senior skipper Megan Watson, who ended her stellar Harvard career with a selection to the ICSA Women’s All-America team. “[Watson] was the A-boat skipper for three years and constantly worked to push the team to achieve its best,” junior co-captain Liz Powers said. “We were very happy her consistent effort every weekend was recognized by her earning All-American status, which means she is among the top eight skippers in the country.” Watson and Powers teamed up in the A division in the national regatta, where they placed 10th in a contest that top-seeded Yale won. Freshman Emily Lambert skippered the B-division boat, with fellow rookie Alexandra Jumper and junior Michelle Konstadt sharing the crewing duties. But neither group could overturn the Bulldogs.“We were a little disappointed with our 10th place finish,” Powers said. “We lost by just three points earlier this season to Yale at New Englands.” For its part, the Crimson co-ed squad placed second at the New England Team Race Championships and seventh at the ICSA National Semifinals in early May to earn its two national bids. Garrity felt that Harvard would be well prepared for the conditions the team would face on the West Coast by changing its practice routine. “We needed to practice in big breeze, in open water venues, where we have to deal with more waves,” Garrity said. While the Crimson performed well in the most crucial part of its season in late spring, Harvard also began its year in impressive fashion with nine top-three team finishes from mid-September through mid-November. Despite the grueling schedule that runs throughout the academic year, Harvard has proven itself well-conditioned to compete on a national scale. The Crimson can expect trips to nationals in the coming years, as most of the team remains intact next season. “We only lose four girls [and two men] next year,” Powers said. “I am excited to see how our recruits fit in on the team and how well we are able to perform next year.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

Coming off a historic campaign and its first-ever Ivy League championship in 2007-08, the Harvard women’s golf team looked to stay atop the Ancient Eight standings and advance among the ranks nationally in 2008-09. While the Crimson would have liked to end the season on a slightly better note, Harvard accomplished precisely what it set out to do in this year’s campaign. Capturing its second Ivy League title in as many years and placing three women on the All-Ivy team—including inaugural Ivy Rookie of the Year Christine Cho—the Crimson steamrolled through its Northeast competition. “This season went phenomenally,” incoming captain Claire Sheldon said. “Winning all but one of our tournaments is really impressive, and we performed very well week in and week out throughout the season.” Claiming titles at the Princeton Invitational and the Yale Fall Intercollegiate tournament for the first time in Harvard history were highlights for the Crimson in the year’s early stages. But the Harvard women did not rest on their laurels after such early-season victories, continuing their winning ways at Lehigh, Brown, and out in California before taking second at the RoarEE Invitational in mid-April, finishing behind Princeton. The Crimson responded to its lone defeat of the year by besting the Tigers and Yale the following week to take home the Ancient Eight crown, and qualifying for the NCAA Regional Championships on the campus of The Ohio State University in the process. There, Harvard would match its finish from a year ago, placing 19th out of a field of 21, a few key rounds away from mixing it up with some of the nation’s top collegiate programs from the Midwest and West Coast. “Our scoring average per round has been getting lower ever since I came to Harvard,” Sheldon said. “However, we did not have as many remarkable rounds as we did a year ago. If we are able to combine our consistent play from this year with some extraordinary rounds here and there, we should be able to improve our finishes in a national tournament.” Senior Emily Balmert, Harvard’s first individual Ivy League champion in program history in 2006 and the first women’s golfer and second Crimson golfer to earn All-Ivy four times, also recognized the steady improvement Harvard women’s golf has seen over its recent campaigns. “The team has gotten stronger every year over the past four years,” Balmert said. “We have amazing depth, as you could take any five of us to any tournament and get a similar result. That type of team can withstand the test of time, and our recruits next year will be great additions.” The Crimson welcomes two new rookies next year, including the highest-ranked recruited player in Harvard history, who should be able to contribute greatly to the team’s efforts. With these new additions next year, the Crimson looks to maintain its grip on the Ancient Eight crown and to continue its progress nationally. “This was our second time at the regional tournament, and I feel it can act as a huge learning experience for us,” Sheldon said. “We can gain a great message from the event, and while it will be tough to recover next year with the three seniors that we lose, I feel next year has the chance to be a really fun year for us.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

For a team that returned every player from last year, the men’s golf team certainly hoped to see a marked improvement over last year’s results. But when the season culiminated with the Ivy League Championships the last weekend of April, Harvard had to be disappointed. After finishing fourth in last year’s league championship, the squad slipped two spots to sixth this year.“I think we accomplished a lot,” captain Michael Shore said. “We had two wins, which is pretty huge. Unfortunately, Ivies...to say it was a disappointment is an understatement.”But all told, the team has high hopes for next season, as most of the squad’s major players will be returning next year.“You’re going to have a solid core of players coming back next year,” Shore said. “You’re going to have four solid seniors, and we have one recruit coming in, so all the holes are going to be filled.”Carrying the Crimson at the championship was junior Greg Shuman—recipient of the 2009 Alex Vik ’78 MVP Award—who finished tied for eighth at +4 on the par-70 Atlantic City Country Club course. Shuman competed in every tournament this season and consistently finished at or near the top of the Harvard competitors. “Greg is the best player on the team,” freshman Mark Pollak said. “That showed consistently throughout the year. I know he was a little disappointed with how he did [at Ivies], but he’s definitely a better player than most of the guys that beat him. We’re looking for him to take it home next year, because he certainly has the ability.”At the GEICO Intercollegiate, Shuman was third-best among the 14-team field on par-3 holes, averaging 3.08 strokes. Shuman was the Crimson leader at the MacDonald Cup in October and the Princeton Invitational in April, in addition to the league championship.Harvard was further supported by the stellar play of rookie Mark Pollak, who led the Crimson in five of the 10 tournaments this season. In the 15-team Big 5 Invitational in October, Pollak finished tied for ninth, shooting 71 the first round and 75 the second. With his signature monster drives, Pollak dominated the field on long par-5 holes, leading all golfers with -4 on those holes.“He’s a great ball striker,” Shore said of Pollak. “He has a very sound, solid game. To play any sport in college, it’s all about focus and priorities.”At the Harvard-Riverside tournament at PGA West in La Quinta, Calif., Pollak tied for the low round by shooting 74 in the tournament, where the Crimson got just narrowly edged out by the Highlanders, 307-305.But losing Shore and fellow senior John Christensen—winner of the 2009 Rob Erickson ’01 Team Player Award—will surely cut into Harvard’s depth next season. Shore kicked off the Crimson’s season with a team-leading +5 at the McLaughlin—a tournament Harvard finished last in last season, improving to ninth of 18 teams this season.Shore’s leadership was instrumental to the team as well.“There is no question that we all have each other’s back,” Pollak said. “Mike definitely contributed to that connectivity, but he wasn’t afraid to get things done even if it challenged the will of the group at the time. He always steered us in the right direction, even if we didn’t want to.”And Christensen was an integral part of Harvard’s first-place finish at the Yale Spring Opener at the beginning of April. His daily low round in Round 2 helped clinch his first-place overall finish and ensured the Crimson’s secure 15-stroke win over the Bulldogs.“It was great to recognize John,” Shore said regarding Christensen receiving the Team Player Award. “Here’s a guy that played on the team for four years, has a great work ethic. Everybody was really happy to see him win.”Despite losing the two seniors, Harvard retains freshmen Antonio Grillo and Connor Wentzell along with Pollak and sophomores Louis Amira and Timmy Wu. Juniors Danny Mayer, Nick Moseley, and Peter Singh will also return supporting Shuman. Next season, Mayer will assume the role of team captain, and together the squad will try to build off what it managed this season and improve on its place in the Ivy League ranks.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

Although the Harvard field hockey team enjoyed some early success, a six-game losing streak at the end of the schedule spoiled what looked to be a promising season.The late-season slide, which included 1-0 losses to Cornell and Dartmouth, dropped the Crimson to 6-11 overall and 2-5 in the Ivy League, good for a fifth-place tie in the conference. The losing streak came largely as a result of a struggling offense, as Harvard managed to find the back of the cage only twice in the final six games.“We had many close games, and hard-fought ones, too,” co-captain Kylie Stone said. “Some went our way and others didn’t. It’s all about the competition and giving it your all, and I think we did that this season.”Over the course of the 2008 campaign, the Crimson had its share of triumphs. Harvard won its opening game, 1-0, against Holy Cross on a second-half goal from sophomore midfielder Chloe Keating. The Crimson dropped its next three games, including a heartbreaker against UMass. Trailing the Minutewomen, 2-1, in the closing minutes, sophomore forward Leigh McCoy stole the ball and blasted a shot into the goal to force overtime. Although Harvard survived the first overtime, it fell in the second extra period, 3-2.The Crimson experienced the emotional high point of the season in its next game against Yale. In a scoreless contest, freshman midfielder Carly Dickson earned a penalty stroke with ten minutes remaining. She lifted a shot into the top right corner, her first collegiate goal, to propel Harvard to a 1-0 victory.The Crimson dropped its next two games before entering its best stretch of the season. Against Vermont, Brown, Northeastern, and Saint Louis, Harvard rolled off four straight wins with the offense totaling 16 goals in the process.The catalyst for the offense proved to be McCoy, who notched a team-leading six scores for the Crimson. Against the Billikens, McCoy tallied two goals en route to a convincing 6-0 victory. Senior forward Tami Jafar also buoyed the Harvard attack, chipping in five scores on the season. Keating added four goals, including three game-winners.The defense was anchored by Stone’s superlative play in net. Stone, the team MVP, held seven opponents to one goal or fewer, including shutouts against Holy Cross, Yale, Brown, and Saint Louis. Her 43 saves and 1.71 goals-against average were both second best in the league against Ivy opponentsTwo talented freshmen were the only Crimson players to earn league honors. Dickson was named to the All-Ivy First Team for patrolling Harvard’s midfield, and teammate Georgia McGillivray earned an All-Ivy honorable mention after starting every game on the back line.“[Dickson and McGillivray] had a huge presence and maturity beyond their years on the field,” Stone said. “It was so fun to be able to see them at the start of what I’m sure will be great careers.”Although the Crimson dropped its last six contests, it has much to look forward to next season under the leadership of co-captains Kristin Bannon and Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon. Harvard returns several top scorers and a foundation of young talent that the program can build upon.“There were definitely some bumps in the road, but there were some good high points,” Crimson coach Sue Caples said. “We can learn a lot from this season.” —Staff writer Timothy J.

The Harvard men’s hockey team’s season shaped up to look a lot like its season last year.A high-flying start to the year with early-season wins over perennial league foes like Clarkson and St. Lawrence devolved into a 17-game winless streak that lasted from November until early February. A strong performance in the Beanpot and a string of late-season wins seemed to indicate that the Crimson had a shot at the ECAC Championship and a bid to the NCAA tournament.But the seemingly miraculous turnaround screeched to a sudden stop with a first-round loss to Brown in the ECAC Championship tournament.“This season was obviously a disappointment for us all,” incoming captain Alex Biega said. “I think overall we showed some promising signs…but unfortunately we couldn’t consistently put it together.” Despite the team’s lack of offensive rhythm, Harvard’s regular-season performance indicated potential for a stronger and more cohesive team next season. This year, junior forward Doug Rogers led the Crimson’s offense with 21 points and eight goals. Rogers was instrumental in leading Harvard’s late-season turnaround. Following the Beanpot tournament, where the Crimson nearly defeated Boston College and Boston University—ranked 15th and first, respectively, at the time—the team went 4-0-2 until it fell in the ECAC tournament. The almost fairy-tale-like turnaround mirrored Rogers’ rise this season as he struggled to find the net until second semester rolled around. With the arrival of spring, the junior scored all eight of his goals and added five assists.“I think in January we started playing smarter as a team,” Rogers said. “In the first half of the season, we had some mental lapses during games. Once we came together and took care of the puck more, scoring goals and playing defense became a lot easier.” Freshman forward Alex Killorn also played a substantial role in Harvard’s late-season comeback. Killorn led all Crimson rookies in scoring with 13 points on six goals—five of which came on the power play—and seven assists.Biega led the team on the defensive end of things and also contributed offensively, nabbing 16 assists and four goals—two of them being game-winners. Biega nearly had five tallies on the season, but his would-be tying goal hit the net a split-second after the final whistle in the opening-round of the Beanpot against BU. The strong performance in the Beanpot came at the end of Harvard’s winless streak and inspired a comeback in league play. “The reason the Beanpot is so special is because it’s anyone’s game, and no matter what your record is or how poorly you have done since then, you always have a shot at winning it,” Biega said. “We were close [to winning] but close doesn’t cut it.” For the second-round of the Beanpot against BC, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 made a switch in net to give sophomore Ryan Carroll his first collegiate start. The gamble paid off for the team—Carroll made 42 saves in that game and contributed to the Crimson’s improvements on the defensive end. The sophomore had another 40-plus save game in the team’s win against then-No. 6 Cornell.The victory came as a result of a full-team effort—something that the Crimson was unable to achieve during its winless winter stretch—as sophomore Matt McCollem, freshman Daniel Moriarty, senior Nick Coskren, and Killorn scored goals.  “When you’re losing, that’s when the team has to be more loose and come together collectively…to find a way out of the hole,” Biega said. “A lot of times, teams tend to become more individualistic and become more frustrated and nervous on the ice. The way you come out of a difficult stretch is getting more as a team and playing more at ease.” While Harvard was able to reach a high level of play throughout the run-up to the ECAC tournament, the Crimson ultimately fell to bottom-ranked Brown in two low-scoring games in the first round. “We played our worst hockey at the most important time of the year,” Biega said. “You can’t win like that no matter who you play. Playoffs are a win or go home mentality each and every game, and I don’t think we illustrated that consistently through the series.” With the likes of Rogers, Carroll, and Biega at the helm for next season, Harvard will look to regain a position at the top of ECAC and national hockey. “Next year will be better for us,” Rogers said. “To have a successful season, we will have to come out of the gate strong while improving week by week. If we can do this, we will see ourselves on top of the leader board in the ECAC.” —Staff writer Lucy D. Chen can be reached at lucychen@fas.harvard.edu.

So much for a sophomore slump. In just his second season at the helm of the Harvard women’s soccer team, head coach Ray Leone guided the Crimson to a 10-3-5 record, which earned his squad its first Ivy League championship since 1999 and its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2004.The third Harvard coach in as many years when he took the job before the 2007 season, Leone has brought stability and a standard of excellence to the program. “It was nice to have consistency,” co-captain Nicole Rhodes said. “Coming into this year we knew what he expected of us…I think that was something no one on the team had had before.”Since Leone’s arrival, the Crimson has gone 20-9-6 overall and has earned 10 All-Ivy selections, including its second and third conference Rookies of the Year in a row.After six successful seasons at Arizona State, Leone faced an immediate challenge in taking over a Harvard squad fresh off a 3-13-1 season in which it had been shut out nine times. He focused on the Crimson’s courageous performance in its 2006 regular-season finale against then-Ivy League champion Columbia. “I said, ‘That’s a team with a lot of character,’” Leone said. “To have nothing on the line other than their own personal pride…we just built upon that. They had the foundation already in them.”Blessed with a roster full of potential, he proceeded to give his underclassmen plenty of opportunities to thrive, and the Crimson responded by finishing with 10 wins in its best performance since 2001.With its stellar freshmen and sophomores one year wiser and its seniors ready to take charge, Harvard had high hopes heading into the 2008 season. It did not disappoint, improving its league record to 5-1-1 and entering the NCAA tournament on an eight-game unbeaten streak.The turnaround was partially a product of Leone’s ability to take full advantage of his situation.“We’ve had great recruits the last couple years, and our senior class was the first core group to stick together in a while, so I think having that experience mixed with the young talent was great for us,” Rhodes said. “That was definitely key.”While the numbers bear witness to his coaching acumen—Leone is 24th among active Division I coaches with over 200 wins in his 17 years of experience—his influence is most apparent in the intangibles.His team has displayed class, competitive fire, and resilience—all the hallmarks of a well-coached group. And most importantly, his players simply love playing for him.“His dedication to the team is unmatched,” junior Christina Hagner said. “He is thinking about [Harvard women’s soccer] 24/7. He’s always thinking about us, the players, about what he can do for us.”“He’s so passionate about what he does and about our team, and he puts so much time into it,” Rhodes added. “His excitement kind of spreads to the team.”Leone drew praise for his tireless efforts compiling extensive scouting reports and editing game film, as well as his motivational techniques.“You need that special ingredient to make everything click, and I think what Ray does a really good job at is spending the time to figure out our strategy against specific teams,” Hagner said. “Ray just loves being a coach…I think that’s really what’s been driving our success.”With the help of his wife Tracey, a coaching assistant, and assistant coach Katie Shields, Leone has created a family environment that facilitates camaraderie and a passion for the game.“We couldn’t have done it without him or [his wife] or Shields,” Rhodes said. “You can really tell they love what they do. It’s definitely been said more than once among the players that we wanted to win for them as well.”And with Leone at the helm, the Crimson appears to be well on its way to establishing a long-lasting legacy in the years to come.“Shields and Ray do an excellent job of recruiting,” Hagner said. “We have tons of players looking at our team, and they have really done a great job of getting the word out there.”No matter what, one can be sure that success will be earned the Leone way—with hard work and an open mind.“We just believe that there’s greatness in every player, every person, and it’s our job to uncover that,” Leone said.—Staff writer Dennis J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of one of the most successful seasons in program history can be both a blessing and a curse. For the Harvard women’s hockey team, which returned 21 players from a squad that made it all the way to the Frozen Four in 2008, the pressure of those high expectations proved to be just a little too much.The Crimson’s up-and-down season, which saw the team rebound from a sub-.500 start to take the ECAC regular-season title, came to a heartbreaking end in the ECAC tournament.Top-seeded Harvard’s semifinal draw was sixth-seeded RPI, a team that had never beaten the Crimson and was playing in its first-ever championship weekend. And though Harvard outshot the Engineers 50-17 for the game, missed Crimson chances and gritty play from RPI’s goaltender pushed the contest to overtime.Thirteen minutes into the extra session, with the Engineers’ power play about to expire, the puck was launched from the point and found its way past junior goaltender Christina Kessler’s glove.Game—and season—over.“Honestly, it’s kind of devastating to have that game decide the remainder of the season,” Kessler said. “It was a tough loss—we totally dominated, and we had a number of chances, and it didn’t seem like anything was going our way.”But simply to get to that point was an accomplishment in itself for Harvard.Though the Crimson lost only one contributor from 2008’s fairy-tale team—Olympian Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08—things didn’t immediately click for Harvard.Tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt and Kessler took time off to play for their Canadian national teams, while tri-captain Jenny Brine and junior Cori Bassett each missed several games due to injury.“I think we just didn’t really get the team together,” Brine said. “We knew what we had to do. It was relatively the same team as last year, so we knew we had the capabilities…We all hunkered down and believed in each other and did our best.”The Crimson was swept twice on the road in November, first by ECAC rivals Clarkson and St. Lawrence, and then by Minnesota.A 3-2 loss to Connecticut knocked Harvard out of the rankings for the first time in six years, and things looked bleak heading into a Dec. 17 matchup with then-No. 3 Dartmouth.But spurred by sophomore Liza Ryabkina’s third-period goal, the Crimson beat the Big Green, 3-2, to head into winter break on a high note.That was the beginning of an impressive turnaround that put Harvard back on top of the ECAC.Starting with a Jan. 9 win over Brown, the Crimson went undefeated in its last 10 ECAC regular-season contests. Along with Harvard’s comeback came the resurgence of Vaillancourt, who was a top-three finalist for the Patty Kazmaier award, honoring the best player in collegiate women’s hockey. “I think starting the season, we felt like we were the hunted,” Kessler said. “Every team, they knew they were playing Harvard, and they put on their game faces and came out to play. The biggest difference [at the end] is that we were the hunters. We weren’t ranked near the end, and we had nothing to lose. We came out every game trying to prove something.”And a little bit of luck gave Harvard the chance to take the ECAC title in the final weekend of play.League-leading St. Lawrence came to town on Feb. 20, and the Crimson took advantage of its golden opportunity. Harvard crushed the Saints, 4-0, to take the conference lead, and sealed the title with a 6-1 thrashing of Clarkson on Senior Day. “It was unbelievable,” Brine said. “It was so exciting to play in. You knew your teammates wanted to win the trophy, but also wanted to win the trophy for our class.”The loss of the senior class will hit Harvard hard next year, as its top three scorers—Vaillancourt, Brine, and Sarah Wilson—are graduating. But left with the bitter taste of disappointment, there’s no doubt that come October, the Crimson will come out hunting.—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

The most important part of Christina Hagner’s offseason didn’t take place in a training facility or on a soccer field. It was all inside her head. But boy, did it show on the field. One of two players to start all 18 games for the Crimson, Hagner led the team with seven goals, good for fifth in the Ivy League, and was third on the team with 15 points.“She was absolutely amazing,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “It happens to every player at different times, and fortunately for us, it happened to her going into her junior year.”But to fully understand how she made her great leap forward, one must first look backwards. Hagner arrived in Cambridge in 2006 as a highly-touted recruit, and by no means was she a bust in her first two seasons.She started every game as a rookie, scoring once and turning in three assists. She made 15 appearances her sophomore season, starting eight, and matched her previous assist total.But there was still something missing. Here was a two-time high school All-American, named by Soccer Buzz as one of the top-100 recruits in the nation, who had simply not yet realized her full potential in college.This year, she finally figured it out.“In the past few seasons I had been a little disappointed,” Hagner said. “I used to have this problem freshman year where I’d pass the ball instead of shooting, and my coaches hated it. You’ve got to have a nose for the net, they say—not being afraid to take risks…having the confidence you can beat your defender and go to the goal.”And that is exactly what she did, catching fire as the month of October began. Hagner kicked off her scoring spree with a goal in a 3-1 victory over Yale Oct. 4, and she notched another goal and an assist in Harvard’s win over Cornell a week later.She would then make it three scores in three games in a victory over Maine, and the ball kept rolling. Hagner came up with the game-winning goal early in the first half at Brown later that week to earn her second Ivy League honor roll of the season.  Her goal-scoring rampage reached five games in a row after she found the net with a header in the 61st minute in a win at Holy Cross Oct. 20. Though the streak ended there, Hagner continued to come up huge in the clutch. With fellow standout forward sophomore Katherine Sheeleigh sidelined by an injury most of the Nov. 8 regular season finale against Columbia, Hagner picked up the load and scored on a one-timer in the team’s title-clinching victory.“She always had the talent,” Leone said. “She would always be in that position, but this time, she would take the opportunity. She created some opportunities totally on her own, and when her teammates created opportunities for her, she was ready to finish.”Her importance to the team’s success this year is undeniable. It’s no coincidence that during the Crimson’s eight-game undefeated streak following its disappointing Ivy-opener loss to Penn, Hagner had 13 points. And in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament against Northeastern Nov. 14, she knocked in a goal, too.Hagner, Sheeleigh, and reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year Melanie Baskind form a three-pronged offensive attack that is downright frightening for opposing defenses to handle.“I play with two of the best forwards in the league,” Hagner said. “They were both Rookies of the Year. They are so awesome to play with, and I’m just so excited to be able to play with them again.”Hagner’s personal style of play is marked by efficiency. Her seven goals came on only 34 shots, representing a team-leading .206 shooting percentage.Although she was pleased with her junior campaign, Hagner still has a lot to prove—she “really should have made All-Ivy,” Leone said. And the ultimate objective, of course, will remain the same as always.“Our goal is to win the championship again, which would be a dream come true for us,” Hagner said.Harvard’s best shot at doing so will hinge on her newfound willingness to take the shot.—Staff writer Dennis J.

And it just keeps getting better. The Harvard women’s soccer team righted the ship in 2007, winning 10 games in its best performance since 2001. Proving that the transformation was no fluke, this year’s squad was even more impressive. The Crimson (10-3-5, 5-1-1 Ivy) equaled its win total from a year ago while taking the league title, as well as nabbing its first NCAA tournament berth since 2004. It was another huge step in second-year coach Ray Leone’s development of the program, which had last won the Ancient Eight crown in 1999. Harvard’s season-long journey ran into trouble right from the get-go, as the Crimson dropped its first two contests in California without managing a goal. But the bonding experience was merely a warm-up for the slew of games left to play. The team’s return back east was accompanied by a six-game unbeaten streak, ignited by a shutout win at New Hampshire and a 2-1 victory over previously-unbeaten Davidson. “That was definitely great for us, and to get that kind of confidence heading into Ivies was integral to our success,” co-captain Nicole Rhodes said. The good times kept rolling as the homestand continued, with Harvard battling to a 1-1 deadlock against Wisconsin on Sept. 14 and a 2-1 overtime win against Northeastern three days later. After a pair of draws on the road against then-No. 12 Boston College and Fairfield, a loss would yet again threaten to derail the team’s season. Defending Ivy champion Penn drilled visiting Harvard in a crippling two-goal shutout on Sept. 27, but the Crimson refused to fold. “One of our seniors, Rachael Lau, pulled us together and said, ‘Guys, wipe that look of doubt off your face. We can do this,’” junior Christina Hagner said. “...I think what separated us this season is that we played with so much confidence and played like we believed in ourselves—because we did.” Harvard bounced back in impressive fashion the following week, making Yale its first victim by a score of 3-1. Seven days later, junior goalkeeper Lauren Mann’s six saves paved the way for a tremendous 3-0 win over Cornell, which was hapless against Harvard’s 20 shots. The Crimson then extended its winning streak at home to four games, putting up four goals against Maine on Oct. 15. Four different players—including Ivy League Rookie of the Year Melanie Baskind and Hagner—got on the scoresheet that day. The Crimson went down to Brown on Oct. 18 and came away with a 3-0 win. Two days later, Harvard finished off its non-conference schedule with a 2-1 victory at Holy Cross for its fifth-straight victory. Another 2-1 win—amidst very stormy conditions—at No. 20 Princeton on Oct. 25 moved Harvard into first place in the league. Jumping ahead with a pair of goals in the first six minutes, the Crimson kept its focus through a 70-minute postponement and held off a desperate Tiger offense to clinch the win. The next weekend’s contest against Dartmouth was looking grim until First Team All-Ivy sophomore Katherine Sheeleigh found the net late in the second half to give her team a 1-1 tie, setting up Harvard for a chance at the Ivy League Championship. As league play came to a close, Harvard found itself tied with Columbia and Princeton with a conference record of 4-1-1. A dramatic double-overtime win over the Lions gave Harvard its eighth league title. Both defenses held strong until, with nine seconds left in the second extra period, All-Ivy First-Team defender Lizzy Nichols snapped the 1-1 tie, nailing a penalty kick in front of a raucous home crowd. The opening round of the NCAA Tournament pitted Harvard against cross-town rival Northeastern. The Crimson held a 2-1 lead in the second half, but the Huskies went on to win the game in penalty kicks, 4-2. —Staff writer Dennis J. Zheng can be reached at dzheng12@college.harvard. edu.

The massive crowd was silent for a moment, as incoming co-captain Lizzy Nichols lined up for her penalty kick. As she put cleat to ball, the crowd began to shout. When the shot ripped the upper nineties, it roared.When the swarm of students sprinted onto the field, it became pure bedlam, and deservedly so.Nichols’ penalty-kick goal with nine seconds left in double overtime not only won the game, 2-1, for the Crimson, but more importantly, it secured an Ivy title.Were it not for that goal, a tie would have resulted, handing Princeton the championship and leaving Harvard on the outside looking in for an NCAA berth.But all that changed in a split second.“It’s just a shock,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said after the game. “To end the game like that, it’s just, I just can’t believe it. To end the game like that and to be the champion in the same second that it ends…”No one would have predicted a miracle finish after the first two overtimes saw the Crimson outshoot Columbia, 9-3, but come away empty-handed.In the first overtime, a shot from Harvard’s freshman standout Melanie Baskind ricocheted off the bottom of the post, bounced down, and looked to have crossed the plane. But the potential goal was not given.Luck, it seemed, was not on the Crimson’s side.With less than a minute left, it was almost a foregone conclusion—Harvard would barely lose out on its Ivy title.But everyone on the field had hope.“It was almost unbelievable,” co-captain Nicole Rhodes said. “Even with a minute left, we thought we were going to win.”With the clock threatening to end the Crimson’s dream run, Baskind was brought down in the box. A few tense moments later, Nichols held her nerve from the spot, and Harvard was crowned champion.“After the goal went in, it was just pure excitement,” Rhodes said.Overall, the Crimson outshot the Lions 25-15, dominating play from the start. The team tallied its first goal of the game in the 27th minute, after a ball from senior Rachael Lau was tucked away by junior Christina Hagner. But the Lions were able to even the score five minutes into the second half, sparking the exciting finish that would define the season for the Crimson.After a stellar year that saw Harvard run through the Ivy competition, this was the game to have. And the crowd knew it. Shirtless men skirted the sideline, not one person in the stands remained seated during overtime, and the noise was of a magnitude rarely seen at a women’s soccer game.It’s been 36 years since Title IX, and the frenzied enthusiasm of the fans demonstrated just how far women’s sports have come.“The crowd meant a lot; it meant a lot for women’s sports in general at Harvard,” Rhodes said. “To have that many people there, it was like a 12th player out there.”For the seniors, the win represented the culmination of four years of coaching switches, struggles on the field, and constant hard work.Through it all, they stayed together and were granted the satisfaction of an Ivy title in their final year, in the final game, with only nine seconds to play.It was a miracle, to say the least, in one of the most memorable games in Harvard soccer history.“It solidified all the hard work our class has put in during our four years,” Rhodes said.  “To finally win one, it gave us something to forever be proud of.”—Staff writer Walter E.

For cross country and track and field—two sports dictated mostly by individual results—it is often difficult to measure team success. But ever since head coach Jason Saretsky brought his coaching expertise to Harvard, it has become apparent just how much both programs have improved in his three years with the Crimson. In the fall, the cross country team posted impressive results despite fielding a young team comprised mainly of freshmen and sophomores. “I thought the cross country season went well,” Saretsky said. “The team competed hard and continued to show what Harvard is capable of.”The Crimson truly stood out in the Heptagonal Championships, where sophomore Claire Richardson, who completed the 5K course in just 17:43.00, finished fourth to lead the women. Pacing the men was junior co-captain Chas Gillespie, finishing fifth overall in the 8K with a time of 24:47.30. As the indoor track and field season rolled around, the team made strides as well, relying on a fusion of leadership from the seniors and young talent from the freshman class—all working towards the common goal of improving the Harvard program. “There was never any issue with us meshing together,” co-captain Becky Christensen said. “It was more like everyone wanted to do well. We were really excited to be leading such a great group of freshmen. The seniors set a good example of pushing through all the way to [the end of] your career.”While the Crimson performed well in numerous events this season, the Battle of Beantown and the HYP meet proved to be the highlights of the indoor season. The Harvard men, just half a point behind Northeastern with only the 4x400-meter relay remaining, relied on the speed of freshman John Dingus, junior Justin Grinstead, junior Jonathan Meminger, and captain Derek Jones to pull off the stunning upset and capture the Beanpot trophy. “To go from fourth to all the way to the top this year is really exciting,” Saretsky said. “It gave them a lot of momentum about how competitive and how successful we can be as a team.”The following week, it was the women’s turn to earn their share of the glory, beating Yale and Princeton by 54 and 18 points, respectively. Christensen moved into second all-time in the high jump record books, clearing 1.91 meters. “[Winning the Battle of Beantown and HYP] hasn’t happened in a long time,” Christensen said. “It definitely shows that Coach Saretsky is building a much stronger team than he had when he came in. It’s only going to keep getting better.”The Crimson carried its newfound success into the outdoor season. Rookie standout Nico Weiler continued to dominate his competition, finishing second at the prestigious Drake Relays with a pole vault of 5.30 meters. At the Penn Relays, Gillespie qualified for the NCAA regionals by clocking in at 14:01.99 to finish fifth in the 5K run. At the outdoor Heps championships, senior Shannon Flahive capped off her career by winning the heptathlon in dominating fashion—185 points ahead of her next competitor. Richardson became the first Harvard runner to claim the women’s 5000-meter title in 19 years, while Christensen became just the third Ivy athlete to win the high jump event all four years. Despite the departure of many contributing seniors who have made a lasting mark for the Crimson, the program remains in good shape, as the talented underclassmen become one year older. “For both indoor and outdoor, it’s been a lot of fun, and it’s exciting to see both the men’s and women’s teams continue to take the next step,” Saretsky said. —Staff writer Kevin T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman Nico Weiler has been a winner all of his life. But unlike some people, winning only makes this outstanding pole vaulter work that much harder. 
“A lot of what makes Nico so successful is just how competitive he is,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “He doesn’t like to lose. I think Indoor Heps was the first time that he had lost in three years.”
A winner in the 2007 and 2008 California state championships and an Under-18 World Champion, Weiler brought his pole vaulting pedigree to Harvard and the Ivy League, where he has dominated the competition since the beginning of the indoor season. 
The accolades for Weiler have already begun to accumulate in mass numbers, as the talented freshman won the IC4A Indoor Championship, the Battle of Beantown, the HYP meet, and qualified for the NCAA Indoor Championships with a jump of 5.20 meters, which was good enough second-best in Crimson history. 
“Mentally, he’s got a great approach,” Saretsky said. “He has an unbelievable ability to perform the best when it matters the most.”
As successful as he has been this season, Weiler continues to remain disappointed with his performance at the Indoor Heps—a clear indication of his competitiveness as an athlete. For many, his second-place finish would have been a great accomplishment, but for Weiler, there is no such thing as a moral victory. 
“A couple competitions indoors didn’t go as I wanted them to go,” Weiler said. “I definitely hope I can get a solid foundation next year.” 
“His competitive nature is a testament to the talent that he has and how hard he works to be the athlete that is,” Saretsky said. “Freshman year is always that transition and making those adjustments. He learned a lot about what it’s going to take to realize his potential.”
Not surprisingly, Weiler found the most difficult transition from high school to college to be off the field. Like most freshmen, he saw his sleeping hours reduced to a mere three or four hours. 
“Probably the biggest problem I had in the first semester was sleep,” Weiler said. “It didn’t really reflect well on the track. That might be a reason why I was injured in the beginning of the indoor season with a hamstring injury.”
But as Weiler slowly adjusted to college life, he began to see successful results in the pole vault. By the time the outdoor season came around, Weiler was jumping better than ever, winning week after week. In fact, he posted his highest jump of the year, 5.30 meters, at the prestigious Drake Relays. 
But Weiler doesn’t just attribute more sleep and settling into college life as the key to his success. 
“The important thing is that every coach in pole vault has different views, and it’s always great to hear those views, because everybody has something right for me,” Weiler said. “Pole vault can’t be done just one way; it’s very flexible. The coach here [at Harvard] is great; I have a lot of fun.”
With just one meet to go—the NCAA Outdoors Championship—Weiler will look to end his freshman season on a even stronger note, setting the stage for a potentially record-breaking sophomore season. But the humble Weiler realizes that he still has a lot more to learn before cementing his status as one of the Crimson greats in the pole vault.
“I want to be faster, be stronger, jump higher,” Weiler said. “I’ll just do my best; we’ll see how it goes.”

After a record-setting junior year in which she finished fourth at the NCAA Indoor Championships, garnered All-American honors, won both the Heps Indoor and Outdoor titles, and won the ECAC Championship, what could Harvard women’s track team captain and high jumper Becky Christensen do for an encore?
Do it all over again. 
The senior followed up her third-year campaign with another outstanding season, earning All-American honors for the second straight year with a fifth-place finish in the high jump at the NCAA indoor competition. 
But for Christensen, there was never much pressure to replicate her tremendous success from junior year. 
“There were expectations that I would do well, but it was more like I was excited to see if I could do better than last year,” Christensen said. “And I managed to do that.”
Christensen’s improvements in her final season included a new personal record at the HYP meet, helping the women to a decisive victory over Yale and Princeton. She set her new personal record at 1.91 meters, a mark that is second on the Crimson’s all-time list. Yet throughout all of her accomplishments, Christensen never appeared distracted by the allure of records.
“She never gets too up or too down,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “That’s one of her greatest strengths. She’s just so competitive, and she’s able to keep things in perspective and just focus on the moment as opposed to getting caught up in the bigger picture and allowing something beyond her control to take her off her game.”
Christensen also made a strong fifth-place showing at the NCAA Indoor Championships, although her finish represented a slip by one spot after she took fourth as a junior. In a year that produced better overall jumps, Christensen saw her championship effort as a bittersweet result.
“I was kind of disappointed because I was hoping I would jump higher,” Christensen said. “I jumped three inches lower than my PR, but at the same time, you can’t be disappointed with placing at Nationals. I was still happy with my place.”
Known throughout the Ivy League for her consistent performances, Christensen won the high jump in nearly every meet during the indoor and outdoor seasons. On her way to yet another resounding selection to the All-Ivy First Team, the star athlete won the Indoor Heptagonals and the ECAC Championships for the second year in a row. 
But as accomplished as Christensen already is, she recognizes that the opportunity to learn never stops.
“We’re still trying to improve our approach, which is my runup to the bar,” Christensen said. “There are a lot of things that I I do well, but I only do them well sometimes, so getting more consistent with my run is something that still needs to be improved, and can help me jump even higher.”
Though she will graduate this year, Christensen will remain in the Boston area to continue to train with her coaches. Christensen harbors hopes of competing at a professional level and will look to attract the attention of a sponsor as she trains.
“I’ll find some random job that will give me enough money to eat and sleep in a bed,” Christensen said. “All I know is that I want to keep jumping.”

Senior Beier Ko has seen it all as a member of the Harvard women’s tennis team. She’s been the eager freshman, sidelined by injury on a team that bulldozed its way to the Ivy League title in 2006. She’s been the veteran on a rebuilding squad that floundered to a 2-17 mark last year. And in 2009, Ko was the leader of an extraordinary story of resurgence. As the undisputed No. 1 player on the Crimson (13-8, 6-1 Ivy), Ko went undefeated in the Ancient Eight and led her team to a share of the Ivy League title. She was unanimously named the Ivy League Player of the Year. “[This year] was amazing,” Ko said. “It’s nice to win Ivies freshman year and senior year. I think it’s a great way to finish my career in college tennis.”Ko, who describes herself as an aggressive baseliner, has improved her play over the past four years, establishing herself as one of the nation’s top players. Ko finished the season ranked No. 99 by the ITA.“As coaches, we’re very proud of the way she’s developed in the last year,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We’re definitely going to miss a super reliable No. 1-type player in our lineup.”In the Ivy League, Ko was more than just reliable. She was perfect. The senior went 5-0 at No. 1 singles and 6-0 at No. 1 doubles. According to Ko, she became more comfortable at net as Green pushed her and the rest of the team to improve their doubles play. The extra practice showed as Ko and her partner, sophomore Agnes Sibilski, took down two ranked teams—No. 36 Hillary Bartlett and Taylor Marable from Princeton and No. 67 Bianca Aboubakare and Cassandra Herzberg from Brown—en route to being voted unanimously to the Ivy League First Team. Ko, honored as the ITA East Senior Player of the Year, was also the lone representative from the Ivy League at the NCAA Women’s Tennis Singles Championships in late May. She is only the third player in Harvard history to be invited to this tournament three years in a row. At the championships, hosted by Texas A&M, Ko challenged No. 46 Nadia Abdala from Arizona State. After an epic three-and-a-half hour match, Ko ultimately met her demise, falling 6-2, 6-7, 6-4. “It was a good match,” Ko said. “I didn’t play very well to be honest, but I put up a good fight, I thought. I definitely gave her a run for her money.”Despite the outcome at the NCAA tournament, Ko showed this year that she was a national threat. She opened the fall season on fire, and at the William and Mary Invitational in September, Ko tore down three nationally ranked opponents—No. 109 Bianca Eichkorn of Miami, No. 46 Ela Kaluder of Arkansas, and No. 94 Katarina Zoricic of William and Mary.Ko’s accomplishments, according to Green, can be attributed to a new drive to succeed. “She’s really matured a lot in the last four months especially—she became more goal-oriented,” Green said. “I think after spring break she was setting more individual goals...getting the first point for the team, sweeping every doubles match.”After sustaining a wrist injury in the spring non-league schedule, Ko was forced to sit out the first two Ivy matches against Cornell and Columbia. When she returned, Ko showed no signs of lingering pain. In matches against Penn, Yale, and Dartmouth, she won in straight sets. “She really stepped it up in Ivies,” captain Laura Peterzan said. “She really wanted to win.” Ko’s endurance also proved to be a major weapon. In tough matches against Princeton and Brown, Ko was forced into a third set. However, she stayed poised and emerged victorious in both battles. “She put a lot of work in as far as her endurance goes,” Green said. “She did a lot of cardio. I think her conditioning really paid off.”Ko’s contribution also came in the form of helping Peterzan lead a young team. After sophomore Agnes Sibilski clinched the Ivy League Championship with a win against Dartmouth, Ko was the first to congratulate her. “I was really close to everyone on the team this year,” Ko said. “It was a great feeling. It was a really close bunch.”Despite Ko’s accomplishments this season, it’s the camaraderie, not the accolades, that she will remember most. “The best part of the experience was meeting the people on the team, bonding, all that stuff,” she said. “I really cherish those moments.”—Staff writer Jake I.

Picked in the preseason to finish in the middle of the Ancient Eight pack, the Harvard women’s tennis team rose above expectations in 2009, and captured the 18th Ivy League Championship in the program’s 35-year history. After a handful of preseason contests, the Crimson (13-8, 6-1 Ivy), ranked No. 66 in the nation by the ITA at the end of the season, battered Columbia, 6-1, and Cornell, 7-0, in the first Ivy weekend. “I think we are playing the best at this moment,” sophomore Samantha Rosekrans said after the Big Red match on April 5. “Our goal has been to be the most improved Ivy League team, and thus far I think we’ve accomplished that goal.” In its next match, Harvard took a step back, falling, 5-2, to No. 46 Princeton. With a 2-1 mark, the Crimson had to win out for a chance at the title. And win out Harvard did. In two thrillers, the Crimson edged out Penn, 4-3, and No. 58 Brown, 4-3. In arguably the year’s defining match, Harvard surged past the defending Ivy League champion, No. 44 Yale, 5-2. To clinch a share of the Ancient Eight title with the Tigers, the Crimson took down Dartmouth, 6-1. The clinching point came from a win at No. 4 singles by sophomore Agnes Sibilski. “We knew we could win,” Harvard coach Traci Green said about the Big Green match. “We all had a feeling we would win, but [the only question was] how and when. And Aggie stepped up nicely, and the overall thought was just, ‘Yes, we did it.’ A little bit relieved at that moment, but at the same time excited, and pumped, and proud. I couldn’t be more proud.”Early in the season, injury setbacks and close losses took a toll on Harvard’s record, and brought into question whether the team would be able to climb in the Ivy League standings. But the Crimson found its stride just in time for league play. “We were surprised [about winning the Ivy title],” senior Beier Ko said. “We wanted to win, but we didn’t expect it too much. We really worked hard, and I think we really deserved it. “Ko was the standout performer on the championship team. Ranked No. 99 in the nation by the ITA at the end of the season, the senior went undefeated at both No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles and was unanimously named the Ivy League Player of the Year.  Captain Laura Peterzan, playing at No. 2 singles, earned second-team Ivy League honors. She went 4-3 in singles and undefeated in doubles. A pair of sophomores, Rosekrans and Sibilski, held down the middle of the singles lineup. Both went 4-3 in league play. Freshman Holly Cao went 5-2 at No. 5 singles, and a batch of rookies combined to go 3-4 at No. 6. For Peterzan, who was a member of the last Ivy League Championship team in 2006 with Ko, this year’s title was a different experience. “As a freshman, we did so well and everything came really easily,” Peterzan said. “We didn’t really understand what it all meant. The two years [after] made us realize how much we took it for granted.”In 2009, Harvard took on a different role—the underdog. Instead of steamrolling opponents, the Crimson needed to pull out several tight matches to take the title. “This year’s win was much harder work,” Peterzan said. “In that way, it was much more valuable to me because we had to work so hard. This one really meant a lot more.” Ko seconded Peterzan’s sentiments. “Being the underdog and winning the Ivy title means so much more,” she said. “The team wanted to win it so badly. It was such an amazing feeling.”—Staff writer Jake I. Fisher can be reached at jifisher@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Harvard softball team may not have ended its season with the title it hoped for, the ups and downs of the 2009 campaign have not only given the team many memorable moments, but, more importantly, have revealed the foundations of a strong team for next season.After a pair of preseason tournament wins at the Miken Classic and the Highlander Classic, the Crimson suffered a string of losses to Ivy League opponents. But a late-season turnaround gave Harvard the opportunity to win it all.With a trip to the Ivy League Championship Series on the line, the Crimson ultimately dropped both games of its final doubleheader against Dartmouth to relinquish the Ivy North Division title.“Obviously, we would have wanted to go further than we did,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “But that being said, it was great to be in it until the last game.”Harvard opened the season with a win for the first time in five years, and followed up tournament play in Kansas with tournament victories in Boca Raton and Radford. In the last contest, the Crimson edged out the Highlanders, who were recently ousted in the first round of the 2009 NCAA tournament, 3-2, to nab the title.But Harvard couldn’t maintain its preseason momentum, as the team split with perennial basement-dweller Columbia in its Ivy opener. Though the Crimson bounced back with back-to-back doubleheader wins against Penn and Rhode Island the next week, the team struggled to maintain consistency as the regular season wore on. “In general, it’s great to see that we were able to beat every team in the league at least once,” Vertovez said. “This was the year of splits. It was clear that we could have taken both games from teams, but we weren’t able to put that together.” After losing the first game of the twinbill to eventual Ivy League champion Cornell, 3-0, in its Ancient Eight home opener, Harvard stormed back to edge the Big Red, 6-5, in the nightcap to snap Cornell’s 15-game winning streak. Harvard then split a pair with defending league champion Princeton the next day.The Crimson faltered in its Ivy North opener, getting swept by Yale, but responded by sweeping the Bulldogs two days later and picking up three crucial division wins against Brown. “It’s been said that we always kind of come through at the end, so I think this team does show a lot of heart,” freshman pitcher Rachel Brown said. “I think we knew it was going to come down to the last weekend all along.” And in the end, it came down to a home-and-home series with Dartmouth on the final weekend of league play. Win three out of four and Harvard would win the Ivy North Division title and advance to the ILCS. Any less, and the season would effectively end.“On Saturday, we knew we had to take at least one of those games so we could win at least one of them at home [on Sunday],” Brown said. “We played our hearts out on Saturday, and we were behind in both games. Coming from behind on Saturday in both games was really exciting.” Harvard staged sixth-inning comebacks in both contests to sweep the afternoon, 7-3 and 6-3.But the bats ran out of steam on Sunday, as the Big Green got the better of the Crimson in two low-scoring games. “It was a very emotional day on Sunday—last home games, Senior Day,” Vertovez said. “After we lost that first game, it was kind of a shocker. We didn’t expect to lose that first one and in the second we put too much pressure on ourselves and that’s when things fell apart. It’s not like we gave it to them on Sunday, they played better than us so they took it.” Despite the disappointing end to the season, Harvard can look forward to a strong returning squad in 2010. Graduating only two seniors and with six returning juniors–not to mention freshman pitching sensation Brown and first-year offensive powerhouse Whitney Shaw–the Crimson will look to be better than ever next year. —Staff writer Lucy D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traditionally mired in the cellar of the Ivy League, the Harvard men’s basketball program showed signs of rejuvenation this season, capturing headlines and personal accolades en route to a .500 record. 
The pre-Ivy League schedule brought the Crimson mixed success. Harvard enjoyed wins over strong programs such as Holy Cross and Santa Clara, but lost to local rivals Boston University and Northeastern. 
But the Crimson's last game of the non-conference schedule provided the team with its signature moment of the season, when it defeated then-No. 17 Boston College. Days after the Eagles beat eventual national champion UNC, Harvard traveled to Chestnut Hill, where the Crimson shocked the basketball world. 
Junior guard Jeremy Lin’s sensational effort—27 points, eight assists, and six steals—carried Harvard to an 82-70 victory, the Crimson’s first-ever win over a ranked opponent.
The game against BC was merely the start to a historic season for Lin. The junior, who averaged 17.8 points per game, 4.3 assists per game, and 5.5 rebounds per game, earned first-team All-Ivy honors and the team MVP award. Lin was the only player in the country to rank among the top 10 in his conference in every statistical category. Next season, Lin, along with junior forward Doug Miller, will serve as team captains. 
“[Lin] was fantastic,” captain Andrew Pusar said. “He is so versatile and can help in so many ways…We were impressed by his ability every single game.”
After receiving attention from the national media for its stunning upset over BC, Harvard settled into Ivy League play. Yet during this pivotal stretch, injuries began to accumulate in the frontcourt. With prized recruit Andrew van Nest and junior Pat Magnarelli already out for the season, senior forward Evan Harris and Miller went down with injuries, and the Crimson stumbled to 2-7 in the Ancient Eight.
The silver lining to this bad luck was that Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker got to showcase his first-class recruits. Forwards Keith Wright and Peter Boehm filled the holes in the frontcourt, averaging 8.0 and 6.1 points per game, respectively, and guards Oliver McNally and Max Kenyi provided valuable minutes off the bench.
“It will help a lot in the coming years,” McNally said of the experience. “It will be positive in the sense that I made some mistakes and I learned a lot…Hopefully, I can build on that.”
As the freshmen gained experience, the Crimson started finding success. Harvard gutted out a 66-60 victory at Penn and prevailed, 72-63, over Columbia before facing Cornell in its last home game of the season. Lin and senior guard Drew Housman each poured in 20 points, and a late defensive stand gave the Crimson a 71-70 win over the tournament-bound Big Red.
Housman’s performance was one of the main ingredients in Harvard’s late turnaround. The senior reached double digits in points in his last eight games, averaging 15.3 points per game over this stretch.
In the final game of the season, the Crimson faced a Yale team that had won the last seven meetings. A complete team effort, with four players scoring in double figures, helped Harvard capture a 69-59 win in the final collegiate game for seniors Housman, Pusar, and Harris.
“The way we finished the season, the toughness we showed after struggling for a little bit, was the most impressive thing to me,” Pusar said.
The win over Yale brought the Crimson’s record to 14-14 and 6-8 in the Ivy League. The team, which returns seven players with at least 10 starts, as well as a healthy front line and a widely-heralded class of recruits, is poised to make a run next season for its elusive first Ivy League title.
“We have a pretty tough schedule, so it’s going to be fun,” McNally said. “I think we can do some really good things with what we learned, with a strong nucleus coming back and some good freshmen.”
“It’s a bright future for the program,” Pusar said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a diamond in Denton, Texas, freshman pitcher Rachel Brown stepped into the circle for the Harvard softball team. It was Opening Day, and Brown had gotten the call. Kansas leadoff batter Stevie Cristoso came to the plate, and before long, was caught looking as the ball sizzled past her for the first strikeout of Brown’s career.The freshman couldn’t have asked for a better start—or an out more representative of her rookie season.“Strikeouts, that has kind of been my pattern the last few years,” Brown said. “Last year I was definitely a strikeout pitcher, but I didn’t expect it going into college because the competition is better. But I guess I just spin the ball, and if I don’t think about it, it’s a lot easier.”Brown’s 211 strikeouts—a total that broke the Crimson single-season record by almost 30 K’s—don’t even begin to tell the story of her sensational campaign. Beginning the season against a Big 12 opponent with more than a dozen games under its belt, Brown hurled a complete-game, two-hit gem to allow the Crimson to claim a 3-2 walkoff victory—its first Opening Day win in five years.“It was my first college start, and my dad was there, and I remember coming off the field and him telling me to call my pitching coach and tell them,” Brown said. “There was a big tournament in [Brown’s hometown of] San Diego and I know they were talking about that there, how Harvard upset Kansas. It was so exciting to see that our team could do this, and that I could pitch in college.”Brown continued her dominance through the preseason slate, taking MVP honors at the Miken Classic and Highlander Classic while leading Harvard to victories in both. And when the whirlwind Ivy season began, the rookie was up for the challenge.In the Crimson’s Ancient Eight opener against Columbia, Brown made perhaps her best showing of the season—a one-hit shutout in which she rung up 14 Lions and walked none—helping Harvard to a narrow 1-0 victory. “You couldn’t even tell she was a freshman out there,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “She dominated as a senior would have. It was so inspiring to play with her…She owned her role as no one else can.”Brown’s consistency and ability to eat up innings proved vital to the Crimson’s success. She finished 15 of her 21 starts, pitched more than half of the team’s innings and earned 16 of its 27 wins—hurling a pair of one-hit shutouts and three two-hitters along the way.And as good as she was as a starter, Brown also made seven appearances in relief, earning a league-high four saves. Against Cornell, Princeton and Dartmouth, Brown pitched a complete game in the opener of each twinbill before coming in to save the nightcap, averaging 9.2 innings per day in those doubleheaders.“As a freshman, she’s really stepped up with [former ace Shelly Madick ’08] leaving last year,” Vertovez said. “She stayed composed. I’m not going to say she was perfect every time, but she would bounce back the next inning and give a solid performance.”When all was said and done, Brown finished the season with a 16-7 record and a 1.49 ERA, her 211 strikeouts coming in just 150.1 innings pitched.Unsurprisingly, Brown was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year after leading the league in strikeouts, saves, innings pitched and opponent batting average (.183), as well as ranking in the top three in every other major pitching category. Brown’s 9.8 strikeouts per seven innings pitched set a new school record and placed her 10th in the nation in that category—making her one of only two freshmen to crack the top 30 and earning her one of the two pitchers’ spots on the All-Ivy First Team.But despite all the recognition and the records broken, Brown never anticipated such success.  “I definitely did not expect everything that happened,” she said. “I didn’t expect to pitch as much [as I did], but I think coming into this, I knew this team would be something special.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

A fitting end just wasn’t to be for the four seniors of the Harvard women’s basketball team. For the second straight year, a final-day loss to Dartmouth derailed the Crimson’s shot at a NCAA Tournament spot—and this year, the Ivy League title slipped away with it.Playing for a share of the championship and a chance at a one-game playoff for the league’s tournament spot, Harvard fell uncharacteristically flat, going down, 64-51, to the Big Green in Hanover, N.H. on March 10.“Unfortunately, in the biggest game of the season, we played our worst,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said after the loss.But while a third consecutive championship may have been too much to ask of the decorated veterans, their farewell season still saw a great deal of resilience and, ultimately, a berth in the NIT.There was one other important development for Harvard over the course of the year: the emergence of its two newest stars.“[Sophomore] Emma Markley came right in and took control,” said senior Katie Rollins, Markley’s partner in the paint and a stalwart down low in her four years on the team. “Emma is really athletic—she’s strong, aggressive, and just has a basketball player’s body.”Freshman Brogan Berry stepped into the shoes of Lindsay Hallion ’08 and did not miss a beat. The rookie point guard started every game, finishing the year second in the Ivy League in assist/turnover ratio and first in three-point percentage. She was the unanimous selection for the conference’s Rookie of the Year.“She could be Player of the Year the next three years and be one of the best players to ever graduate from Harvard,” Rollins said. “The sky is the limit for her.”With the play of Markley and Berry, along with the experienced seniors and a solid supporting cast of underclassmen, the Crimson went 8-6 in the busy non-conference part of its season.An upset over Vermont on Dec. 11 was followed by a trip to California, where, in the first game, the Crimson would come back from a seven-point deficit in the final two minutes against UC Santa Barbara in a win that outgoing co-captain Niki Finelli would label a “stepping stone.”An overtime victory over Northeastern capped off an impressive first half of the season.However, in its opening conference game, the Crimson fell just short against rival Dartmouth, with Harvard unable to get a shot off in its final possession.“To lose to Dartmouth on your home court in the first game was a blow,” Rollins said.The Crimson knew it had to dig itself out of a hole, and bounced back with wins over Penn, Princeton, Yale, Brown, and Cornell.On Feb. 14, however, another heartbreaking loss ensued—this time, at the hands of Columbia. Again, Harvard was just one shot away from the victory.The defeat was incredibly costly, placing the Crimson two games back of then-undefeated Dartmouth. Another slip-up would surely end any chance that Harvard had at the league title.The group met the challenge head on, overcoming a lot of adversity along the way. First was the 22-point comeback against Princeton. Then there was the fact that the squad of just ten girls—often left with no subs for practice—had to deal with Finelli’s season-ending injury.But Harvard, led by its core of four seniors, continued to win.In a 91-57 demolition of Yale, co-captain Emily Tay put on a show, scoring a career-high 34 points in her final game at Lavietes. Tay, who earned her third consecutive first-team All-Ivy honors, finished her career second on Harvard’s all-time assists list and eighth on its scoring list.“She has made her mark on the Harvard basketball program, and players like her don’t come around often,” Finelli said.Six consecutive victories set up the decisive showdown with Dartmouth. While the Crimson did not get the championship it had hoped for, it did achieve a spot in the NIT, where it would lose to a very strong St. John’s team in the first round.“We fell short of our ultimate goal in terms of not winning the Ivy League,” Finelli said. “It’s disappointing, but when I reflect back over the year and over my career, I don’t regret a minute of my experience.”—Staff writer Jay M.

In sports, it is often difficult to measure progress, especially when numbers fail to provide much insight. For the Harvard baseball team, which went 10-30 last year with an 8-12 Ivy League record, this season did not present much of a contrast statistically, but consistent observers of the Crimson would likely attest to the team’s improvement.Harvard finished its 2009 campaign at 13-28, going 10-10 in conference play, in large part due to an injury-ravaged pitching staff that forced the Crimson to rely heavily on untested freshmen and sophomores. But Harvard also took steps towards future success.“This year set the team up nicely to come back strong, especially with our pitching staff,” captain Harry Douglas said. “A lot of pitchers were forced to step up in big spots and get a lot of experience.”The Crimson rotation was already full of question marks coming into the season, but more uncertainty was piled on after sophomore ace Max Perlman went down in his first start with an elbow injury and had to undergo Tommy John surgery.“I don’t think you can lose your No. 1 pitcher—not only the No. 1 pitcher on our team but perhaps the No. 1 in the Northeast—and not feel it,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “Losing a big gun like Perlman—in retrospect, we just never were able to recover from that.”But while the Crimson may not have rebounded from the early end to Perlman’s season, it did get an opportunity to preview its future.While rookie hurlers like Brent Suter, Conner Hulse, Jonah Klees, and Will Keuper had their share of struggles, they also flashed potential.Suter and Hulse especially impressed near the end of the season, leaving Harvard optimistic about boasting a formidable rotation next year.“I thought the freshmen did a great job,” senior Tom Stack-Babich said. “It was pretty impressive. Ideally you wouldn’t like to have a bunch of freshmen out there learning on the go. It wasn’t the best for us this year, but it certainly should help the program.”As rookies defined the Crimson’s pitching, Harvard’s seniors set the tone at the plate. Along with Douglas and Stack-Babich, Matt Rogers and Taylor Meehan put up big numbers, with Stack-Babich and Rogers combining for 17 home runs while Douglas and Meehan hit .342 and .331, respectively.The Crimson fourth-years not only posted impressive statistics, but they also produced when their team needed them the most.Douglas drove in the game-winning run in the final inning twice, while Meehan and Stack-Babich each blasted walk-off home runs this season.“It was our last chance to make an impact,” Douglas said. “When we had a chance to come back in a game late, we were jumping on that opportunity.”As it does every season, Harvard faced a tough early schedule, playing its first 16 games down south against nationally-competitive opponents. The Crimson only mustered two wins in its travels, and got off to a rough start in the Ivy League season, dropping both games of a doubleheader to Columbia. But Harvard soon caught fire against its Ancient Eight foes, jumping out to an 8-4 league record and giving itself an outside chance to catch Rolfe Division-leading Dartmouth and earn a spot in the Ivy League Championship Series. Unfortunately for the Crimson, its offense hit a cold spell at the worst possible time, and the team suffered a sweep by Brown in a four-game series that knocked Harvard out of Rolfe contention.“That was a real shot to the gut,” Stack-Babich said. “That made the next weekend not worth anything, which is always hard. It was pretty embarrassing.”Still, the Crimson kept its pride in the final stretch of the season, splitting a four-game weekend set with the eventual Ivy champion Big Green and capping off the year with a thrilling comeback win in a 16-13 slugfest against Northeastern.While Harvard’s final record was not ideal, the team recognizes the importance of the progress it made.“I liked our ballclub,” Walsh said. “I thought every game we had a chance. For a team that played as many games as we did on the road, losing our No. 1, I guess that was kind of the philosophy. As Bill Parcells says, ‘You are what you are.’”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

Coming into the 2008-09 campaign as the defending Ivy League champion, the Harvard men’s tennis team (13-9, 5-2 Ivy) was confident about its potential, but the season was far from easy for the Crimson rackets. Harvard started off the year facing a number of top-30 teams—including No. 1 Georgia—in a series of diagnostic tests for the Crimson. Harvard struggled against the top-notch competition, although No. 69 Chris Clayton, the Crimson co-captain, provided one bright spot, beating No. 12 Nate Schnugg of Georgia. Harvard competed in a series of invitationals throughout the fall and winter in preparation for the spring. Clayton had a very successful Wilson/ITA Northeast Tennis Regional tournament, in which he was seeded No. 1 in both singles and doubles. The senior recovered from his quarterfinal loss at last year’s regionals by beating Columbia’s Bogdan Borta in the finals, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3. After two tiebreakers, Clayton got the best of Borta with relentless shots and solid serves. Paired up with sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans, Clayton also won in the doubles final against Brown’s top pair.“It looked like we were going to have a great year after our performances at Napa Valley [in the Tennis Classic] and our showing at Flushing [in the USTA Invitational],” Chijoff-Evans said. “We did pretty much what we had to do early on.” In February, the Crimson also fared well at the ECAC Men’s Indoor Tennis Championships, a tournament that featured fellow Ivy League opponents as well as St. John’s and Boston College. After easily disposing of the Red Storm, 4-0, Harvard faced tough opposition in Penn. Chijoff-Evans captured the winning point for Harvard in an exciting matchup against the Quakers’ Hicham Laalej. After dropping the first set, Chijoff-Evans won the second in a tiebreaker, 7-6 (10-8). The sophomore showed that he wasn’t ready to give up, and the third set was a thrilling finish for a tense encounter. Chijoff-Evans proved to be the victor, holding on to a 9-7 win. Columbia, which would prove to be a thorn in the Crimson’s side later on in the spring season, was Havard’s opponent in another narrow contest. The Crimson lost both its doubles games and found itself down a point early in the meeting. But senior Sasha Ermakov, sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien, and freshman Davis Mangham were able to turn the tables as Harvard went up, 3-1. Columbia bounced back to take two more singles matches, and the competition boiled down to the final matchup between freshman Alistair Felton and Columbia’s Ekin Sezgan. Felton shook off his doubles loss by showing his determination in winning the match in three sets, 3-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4. Harvard took the ECAC Championship in what would be its last championship of the season. The Crimson couldn’t defend its Ivy League title successfully this year, ceding the crown to Columbia. Harvard began its Ivy League campaign against the eventual champions and lost, 4-3. It was the first loss for the Crimson in Ivy League play in two seasons. “I think it was fair to say that this year was disappointing because the team had done a great job improving,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “We had every reason to think that we could win the championship again.”Harvard bounced back with a close win at Cornell, 4-3, but couldn’t build on to that victory, losing to Princeton the following week, 4-3. “We were really excited after the ECAC, but we suffered too many losses in Ivy League play,” Chijoff-Evans said. “We got unlucky when we played close matches.” Two losses would prove costly to the Crimson, which was forced to settle for a second-place finish at best. But Harvard would not lose for the rest of the season, beating Penn, No. 73 Brown, and No. 64 Yale, 5-2. Defeating two ranked opponents in three days earned the Crimson a No. 64 ranking. The end of the season would pit Harvard against lowly Dartmouth, a team that failed to muster a win this season. The Crimson won in dominant fashion, 6-1, and the victory secured a joint second place finish in the standings. Clayton represented Harvard in the NCAA singles tournament but lost in the first round.With a strong core of players returning, the Crimson will look to reclaim its Ivy title next season.—Staff writer Brian A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For four years, Harvard baseball captain Harry Douglas was entrenched in a constant struggle with consistency.
In his first two seasons with the Crimson, Douglas could not consistently stay healthy. He appeared in just 29 games and logged only 37 at-bats, unable to remain on the field long enough to have a chance to display his skills.
Last year, Douglas could not consistently hit a baseball. He kicked off 2008 with a bang, pounding two home runs in Harvard’s season-opening series against then-No. 16 Wichita State. But from that point on, his production dropped off, and he finished the season with a .194 batting average and just four extra-base hits.
This season, Douglas and consistency faced off for one final battle. Only this time, Douglas won.
After picking up a hit in six of his first seven games, the captain unleashed a longball in the eighth inning of a matchup against UAB on March 15 and never looked back. Douglas continued to hit the ball with authority for the remainder of the season, finishing with a team-high .342 batting average along with three homers and 27 RBI in 41 games. The third baseman’s performance was good enough to land him an All-Ivy League Honorable Mention.
“I really think it’s just from taking a better approach this year,” said Douglas, who credits a more aggressive mentality at the plate for his resurgence. “I definitely felt confident after the first few weeks. That helps you, even when you’re struggling a little bit. ”
But while Douglas’ impact in the batter’s box undeniably provided a boost to  an explosive Crimson offense this season, his contributions as captain were perhaps even more significant.
With a depleted pitching staff and injuries to key players, Harvard faced an uphill battle in 2009, especially after a grueling spring break trip down south that pitted the Crimson against some of the top teams in the nation. After losing 16 of its first 18 games, including the first two of the Ivy League season to Columbia, Harvard easily could have resigned itself to a lost season. But Douglas’ leadership set an example that the rest of the squad could not ignore.
“Harry was very aggressive and very intense,” senior Tom Stack-Babich said. “He’s just a really competitive kid who loves to win. That helped, especially with the younger guys.”
While the Crimson finished 13-28 with a 10-10 Ivy League record, the team exhibited resilience throughout the season, winning several games via comebacks and walk-off hits. Douglas—who had two game-ending hits of his own this year—was a key factor behind Harvard’s refusal to give up. For all of Douglas’ struggles with consistency, his strong work ethic has always been a constant. In fact, it is the aspect of his personality that captured the Crimson’s attention in the first place.
When Douglas was in high school, Harvard coach Joe Walsh had no intentions of making a hard recruiting push for the South River, N.J. native. But Mike Garlatti, an old acquaintance of Walsh’s and a scout for the Colorado Rockies, had coached Douglas on a fall-season team for high schoolers looking to play at the college level and recommended him to the Crimson skipper.
“[Garlatti] had said to me, ‘Joe, if you take [Douglas] and he doesn’t play right away, he’s going to make everyone in front of him work harder,’” Walsh said. “‘This kid’s just going to work his tail off and get better for you.’ Mike was right.”
After four years, Walsh’s investment in Douglas has paid off, and the graduating captain has found that elusive consistency, on and off the field.
“Harry handled a lot of things very well and did a great job with the team,” Walsh said. “I won’t forget his contributions, that’s for sure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Senior Night for the women’s basketball team in February of 2006, a freshman covered her first live game for The Harvard Crimson’s sports section. I took my seat on press row alongside the then-chair of the Sports Board, excited by the crowds that were (slowly) filtering into Lavietes Pavilion and the Harvard and Princeton squads exchanging high-fives in their layup lines. Noting my wide eyes, my fellow reporter said, “Remember, you can’t cheer.”I had my pen and pad, my tape recorder, and my eye for basketball at the ready. But at that moment, I realized that sportswriting would require more from me than I ever anticipated—and more than I could ever really deliver. The Crimson holds itself to high standards of journalism. One of its more sacred rules is its conflict-of-interest policy, which prohibits writers from covering blockmates, close friends, and significant others (poorly-masked man-crushes are apparently fair game, as the cross that multiple male members of the Sports Board carry for star hoopster Jeremy Lin has demonstrated). While this policy is an essential component of the Crimson’s ability to provide unbiased coverage, it clashes with what sports are meant to deliver: pride, personality, and a connection between teams and fans.My four years covering sports for The Crimson have only confirmed what I suspected at that first women’s basketball game: that I, a sports fan once and for all, won’t ever be able to separate myself from the personalities, the excitement, and the stories that make sports great. Just like my mother, who insists on being told whom to root for whenever a sporting event is on in my home, I find it difficult to watch a game—especially a Harvard game—without my allegiances shining through. Every game I’ve covered for The Crimson has been an exercise in maintaining neutrality, in walking the fine line between knowing the Harvard teams the best I can and realizing that I’m a fan of those same teams. I’ll admit it: more often than not, I’ve failed in walking this line. My experiences covering sports for The Crimson have been anything but detached. Like the sporadic e-mail correspondence I’ve kept up with a graduate of Harvard’s Class of 1944 and grandfather to a member of the women’s basketball team; he follows The Crimson’s coverage of the team because his age keeps him from traveling to watch his granddaughter play in person. Like the interview I conducted with the baseball team’s hearing-impaired student manager, whose enthusiasm for his teammates and life showed me the best that sports and Harvard have to offer.Stories like these have made it impossible for me—and, I suspect, the other writers whom I’ve been lucky enough to call friends—to cover Harvard sports with complete objectivity. Far from interfering with our coverage, these connections strengthen it. I don’t cover Harvard teams because it’s my job (it’s not) or because these teams are the best in the country at what they do (though occasionally, they are). I cover them because sports and college are about making connections to people, places, and events. Sports and its fans—writers included—would be far worse off if these connections were avoided, and perfect neutrality maintained.For me, the Sports Board—and The Crimson overall—has been many things. It’s made me a better fan, and a better writer. It’s been a free trip to Fenway, a place in the press box, and a lesson in watching three-win teams alongside league champions.I’ve seen my sports knowledge expanded by covering teams like volleyball and sailing along with my better-known favorites. But inevitably, my experience at the Crimson has gone far beyond the coverage—and, in so doing, gone far beyond neutrality. No one who follows sports can maintain that the joy they find in it is just about sports: it’s about family, friends, lasting memories, and unforgettable moments. College, unsurprisingly, is the same way. Covering sports in my four years at Harvard has led me to unexpected people and places, and even made me reconsider my career plans. Most importantly, it has included me in a group of people who unabashedly love sports, Harvard, and each other. I won’t apologize for my bias—I embrace it. —Staff writer Emily W.

Objectively, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had a fantastic season.Finishing with an 8-1 (6-1 Ivy League) record, the Crimson only dropped one contest—to its archrival Princeton—over the entire campaign. In addition, Harvard claimed a second-place finish at both the ECAC and Ivy League Championships, while sending two swimmers and one diver to their respective NCAA tournaments in late March.The Crimson was close to perfection in its performance in the pool this season. But following the team’s flawless 2007-08 showing, close was not good enough.“As a team, we didn’t achieve what we wanted to achieve,” co-captain David Guernsey said. “We set some goals to go out and win Ivies, but we didn’t, so I think we were disappointed in that sense.”Harvard began the season a little shakier than last year, squeaking by Cornell, 158-142. But the men picked up the pace after the reality check, speeding by Dartmouth and Columbia, 253-47 and 200-100, respectively.This three-win streak was followed by three non-conference contests. The Crimson placed second in the Georgia Invitational and eighth in the Big Al Invitational, before pulling out a dual-meet victory over Arizona State.With the start of the second semester, Harvard returned to its home pool and began the sprint to the Ivy League and ECAC finish line. After trouncing Navy, 188-112, the Crimson breezed past Penn and Brown, 213-85 and 169-119, respectively.But Harvard was still less than pleased with its performances in the pool.“Starting in the beginning of the season, it took us a while to come together as a team—like to get our [stuff] together, basically,” said distance standout and incoming captain Alex Meyer. “A lot of things were not going as smoothly as they should have been.”The Crimson’s real test to prove themselves as a team came during the HYP meet, which pitted the swimmers and divers against their main competition, the Tigers.In contrast to the previous season, this year’s Harvard squad entered the matchup as the underdog instead of the team to beat. But after the first day of competition, the Crimson found itself three points ahead of Princeton.“That moment for everyone pretty much solidified the fact that we [needed] to get moving because we could beat Princeton,” Meyer said. “There was a major mental shift at that moment.”Harvard defeated Yale, 251-102, but wasn’t able to pull out the win over Princeton, which passed the Crimson, 193-160.This defeat was followed by two more, with Harvard placing second at both the ECAC and Ivy League Championships. Navy got the best of the Crimson, 703.5-512.5, in a rematch at ECACs, while the Tigers outswam Harvard once again at Ivies, 1663.5-1311.5.Even with these losses, the Crimson had finally begun to swim to its full potential, and act as a single unit.“Our main improvement was coming together,” Guernsey said. “Definitely by the end of the season, we were one team with one goal. I think that’s a huge accomplishment, having 40 guys come together and really strive for excellence.”Harvard also was able to send three of its athletes to their respective NCAA swimming and diving tournaments. Sophomore standout Zac Ranta finished 11th in the three-meter dive with 596.5 points at NCAA Zone A’s, while also competing in the preliminaries of the one-meter event.Senior Bill Jones and Meyer also donned their crimson and white on the national scene, representing their school at NCAAs at Texas A&M. Jones placed 28th in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 47.11, while Meyer finished 25th in the 1650-yard freestyle and 44th in the 500-yard freestyle, with times of 15:06.58 and 4:24.38, respectively.With these individual performances and team improvements in mind, the Crimson will look to make another run at Princeton in the coming season.—Staff writer Alexandra J.

The Harvard men’s soccer team will look back on its 2008 season and forever wonder what could have been.What if outgoing co-captain and star forward Michael Fucito had not been forced off the field by injury after only 30 minutes in the 1-0 loss to Dartmouth? What if the Crimson had capitalized on one of its many chances in a game that it dominated against Penn, instead of going down, 1-0, in overtime? What if Harvard had avoided the two mental lapses that led to two South Florida goals in a 2-1 loss in the second round of the NCAA Tournament?“Overall, it was a great season,” Fucito said. “But unfortunately a few key moments overshadowed the good and made it disappointing.”Still, the Crimson—led by a strong senior class—was able to put together a solid season containing some outstanding highs on the way to a 12-6 record.In his first year on the job, Harvard coach Jamie Clark was immediately thrown into the fire, as the Crimson opened the season with a tense matchup against his predecessor John Kerr’s Duke Blue Devils.Harvard went down, 3-1, to Duke, but was able to bounce back just two days later against NC State. Three second-half goals helped the Crimson to an impressive 3-1 victory.An overtime loss to Rhode Island was sandwiched in between wins against Vermont and New Hampshire before Harvard was soundly beaten, 5-1, by Boston University in the final game before the start of Ivy play.Again, the Crimson showed its mettle following a loss, downing Yale and Cornell to set up a showdown against 2007 Ivy League champion Brown.“Going to Brown had that extra edge,” incoming co-captain Andre Akpan said. “[The game] was passionate and hard-fought, and something about the atmosphere really made us take off.”In the end, the much-anticipated matchup was not even close, as Harvard destroyed its fierce rivals, 4-1, in Providence.The win put on display the main strength of the team: an extremely potent counterattack. All season long, the Crimson used its pace to move the ball quickly up the field, utilizing the creativity of senior midfielder John Stamatis, who finished the season with a team-high nine assists, and the attacking prowess of Fucito and Akpan, who combined to score 19 goals.Three wins followed—including a notable 3-1 victory over Providence—before the loss to a very strong Dartmouth squad on Nov. 1.Harvard got back on track with a nonconference win against Maine before crushing Columbia, 6-1, in a game that saw Akpan break the Crimson’s all-time records for both points and assists.In the final league match of the year, then-No. 26 Harvard faced off against then-No. 24 Penn, with the Ivy League title up for grabs. The Crimson dominated the game, outshooting the Quakers, 15-7, in regulation, but was unable to find the net in the biggest game of the season. Instead, Penn snagged a goal five minutes into overtime.“We blew it in the Ivy League,” Fucito said. “The goal that Penn scored was a soft one, and we had chances to win that game early. We were the better team.”Despite the disappointing third-place finish in the conference, Harvard earned an at-large spot in the NCAA Tournament.A 1-0 win in the first round against UMass provided the high point of the season for the Crimson. “There were horrible field conditions and everyone was exhausted, but we somehow managed to pull out a victory on opponents’ territory,” said Akpan, whose strike in the 102nd minute sent Harvard into the second round.The season ended with a 2-1 loss to No. 8 South Florida, with the Crimson pushing the powerhouse Bulls to the brink. “I thought we were brilliant,” Clark said after the match.Akpan led the team with 10 goals on the season, and was named a semifinalist for the Hermann Trophy, awarded to the top collegiate player. Fucito was a finalist for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award, and was selected by the Seattle Sounders in the 2009 MLS SuperDraft. Stamatis led the Ivy League in assists and joined the striking duo on the All-Ivy First Team.While Akpan, Fucito, and Stamatis deservedly garnered most of the attention, Harvard’s defensive unit kept seven clean sheets on the year. Senior Michael Giammanco and co-captain Luke Sager were rock-solid at the back all season long. Junior Kwaku Nyamekye—also a first-team All-Ivy selection—and sophomore Robert Millock rounded off a back four which gave up only 18 goals over the course of the season.—Staff writer Jay M.

The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team had a year of record-shattering success, the culmination of which was winning, for the first time ever, both the Ivy League and ECAC conference championships in a single season. “It’s a pretty amazing feat,” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said. “It’s hard enough to win one.”The Crimson last won the Ivy Championship in 2005, and took home the ECAC crown in 2007, so to win them both together required contributions from every member of the team. The Ivy championship limits the squad to 18 swimmers and three divers, so Harvard was forced to split up its 26 swimmers and six divers. “They were competing against full squads of 18 and they won,” Morawski said. “So to split the team and to have both halves of the team win their respective [championship] meets is pretty amazing. That was definitely a highlight for everyone.”Harvard had four individual Ivy champions—sophomore Kate Mills in the 200-yard freestyle, junior co-captain Alexandra Clarke in the 1000-yard freestyle, sophomore Katy Hinkle in the 100-yard backstroke, and freshman Meghan Leddy in the 200-yard backstroke—with all of those victories coming in school-record time.The Crimson also won the 200-yard and 800-yard freestyle relays, setting a new school benchmark in the latter.“[The 800-yard relay] was a really great performance,” Clarke said. “I think that was the first time [we’ve] ever won that race. It’s definitely the first time that we’ve beat Princeton since I’ve been here. They have a really impressive group of 200 freestylers, so beating them was a pretty big accomplishment.”Those records represent just a fraction of Harvard’s impressive season. All told, 12 new standards were set by Crimson swimmers this season.Clarke reset her own records in the 500-yard and 1650-yard freestyle at Ivies, and junior Sophie Morgan set a record of her own in her runner-up finish in the 100-yard butterfly, tying the benchmark set by Mills earlier in the year. Mills reset the 200-yard butterfly record, and the 400-yard freestyle relay team added its names to the record board as well.But that record-breaking trend started way back in December, when Harvard set nine school marks at the Georgia Invitational—unprecedented for such an early-season meet. The Crimson finished third in a field that included national powerhouses Georgia and California.Harvard was no less dominant against Ancient Eight competition. The team won its first five league meets by an average of 93 points before running into its first major competition in the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton tri-meet.The Crimson fell to Princeton, 170.5-148.5, in head-to-head competition. The sheer number of wins generated by the Tigers’ superstars made a dual meet victory difficult for Harvard to attain, but the Crimson was able to get even at the championship meet, where the scoring format tends to favor depth.At Ivies, Harvard beat runner-up Princeton—which had held the title for the last three years—by a final score of 1583.5-1334.Mills and Clarke, who together had a hand in setting eight school records, represented the Crimson at NCAAs, with Mills recording Harvard’s top finish by placing 23rd in the nation in the 200-yard butterfly. The Crimson graduates just two seniors this year, and with the addition of a strong recruiting class, Harvard has built the foundation to be an Ivy powerhouse for the forseeable future. “I always say that of course I want to win, but its much more powerful when [the swimmers] truly not only want it but when they do everything that it takes to make it happen, and I saw that on a daily basis this year,” Morawski said. —Staff writer Alexandra E.

The Mighty Ducks had the Bash Brothers. Harvard wrestling has its co-captains. Junior co-captain Louis Caputo concluded a stellar season with an eighth-place finish at the NCAA championships on March 21, joining junior co-captain J.P. O’Connor as one of five Crimson wrestlers to achieve All-American status twice.In a year that featured a number of team struggles for Harvard (5-12, 2-3 Ivy), its all-star captains led a three-man charge to the championships—with sophomore Corey Jantzen completing the trio—finishing 41st in the nation to notch a positive conclusion to a roller-coaster season.“We had our ups and downs, but that’s been the story since I got here,” O’Connor said. “With injuries, we don’t have the depth that other teams have.”Despite a slew of setbacks that sidelined Jantzen, Caputo, rookie heavyweight Spencer Desena, and others, Crimson coach Jay Weiss took encouragement from the squad’s resilience all season.“When the injury bug hits us, some of our [team] goals are unattainable,” he said. “But we really kept focused on what we needed to do at the end of the year…If our guys wrestle their best at the end, then we’re doing something right.”A number of grapplers made strong showings to complete their campaigns, including junior heavyweight Andrew Knapp (7-13), who upset fifth-seeded Mike Sprigg in the first round of the EIWA championships. O’Connor (32-5) and Jantzen (14-3) took second in the tournament at 157 and 141 lbs. respectively, while Caputo (34-8) took third at 184, justifying the trio’s season-long ranking in the top 10.With solid competitors at the squad’s helm, the Crimson also promoted the development of its rookies, many of whom faced immediate pressure filling in for injured teammates.In particular, freshman Walter Peppelman (149) excelled in his first season, going 21-13 with a seven-bout win streak in the dual season. The rookie standout led the team with eight technical falls, more than the rest of the squad combined. Still, Weiss lauded his rookies even more for their resilience than for their accomplishments.“When you look at Peppelman, he lost more times this year than he has in his career,” Weiss said. “When you get pressed into action, the biggest thing you need is experience, and [the freshmen] had that experience right away without having the opportunity to take their time. I’m amazed at how they responded.”The Crimson’s rookies may have weathered the challenges of collegiate wrestling so well in large part due to the squad’s tight-knit dynamic. O’Connor praised a program that promoted a supportive atmosphere for the small squad throughout the season.“Overall, we had a great time,” O’Connor said. “This was the closest our team has been in terms of being a family.”Unfortunately for Harvard, it will lose important members of its “family” next year with the departure of seniors Tommy Picarsic (10-7), Pat Ziemnik (4-7), and Dominic DeNunzio. Picarsic (133) in particular finished with a flourish, putting together a four-match dual winning streak in his final season en route to a career record of 18-15.Still, as Harvard showed throughout its campaign, the squad has the potential to bounce back from the losses.Despite continuing to falter against juggernauts No. 24 Penn (12-7, 4-1) and No. 6 Cornell (12-2, 5-0)—both of whom bested Harvard by more than 20 points this year—the Crimson has confidence that its close-knit group of returning grapplers sets the team apart.“There was great team chemistry [this year],” Caputo said. “We had a fun group of freshmen, and it’s sad to see the seniors go, but we’ve got great talent coming back.”—Staff writer Max N.

Though it wasn’t always pretty, the No. 6 Radcliffe women’s heavyweight crew team is back where it ended last season—at the NCAA Championships. The 2009 season held its share of losses to perennial rivals, but the Black and White saved some of its most competitive racing for May and managed to earn a bid to Camden, New Jersey.In addition to the victories on the race course, four rowers—sophomore Olivia Coffey, incoming co-captain Laura Huppert, senior Esther Lofgren and captain Anna Kendrick—were named to the All-New England team while coach Liz O’Leary took home the honor of New England Coach of the Year.Earning a bid to the NCAAs was particularly satisfying for Radcliffe, as the Grand Final of the Sprints saw the Varsity Eight edge Princeton and finish within one second of the No. 2 Yale Bulldogs.“At Eastern Sprints, we got second, and I think that we should have been rowing like that all season and our previous results don’t really reflect that,” Coffey said. “It’s a little frustrating not to peak earlier, but now that we’re coming into final races, we’re where we want to be.”Earlier in the season, the Tigers had finished 6.8 seconds ahead of the Black and White to win the Class of 1975 Cup while Yale beat Radcliffe for the Case Cup by 5.9 seconds on the April 25 Charles River Challenge.The Black and White showed early season promise by beating Dartmouth and Syracuse on April 18 to win the O’Leary Cup.Both the Varsity Eight and the Second Varsity Eight showed good speed in the second half of the race course to comfortably edge the Big Green and the Orange.But the Charles River Challenge saw the Black and White lose to three ranked opponents—the aforementioned Yale, USC, and Virginia—before bouncing back with wins against Gonzaga and Tennessee to close the weekend. On the first day, Radcliffe struggled to find a consistent rhythm and prevent other crews from pulling away after the first 500 meters—something that the Black and White’s hopes to refine leading up to the NCAAs.For the lightweights, first-year coach Heather Cartwright has moved into the top job without missing a beat, leading the No. 5 lightweight women’s crew team to a 5-1 dual record that included defeats of top-ten opponents Georgetown, Prinecton, and MIT during the season.“We feel like we set a great foundation for the future by working really hard and having a really great team dynamic and ultimately having a lot of fun,” captain Rebekah Kharrazi said.The season began with a 3-0 start after wins against Holy Cross and Smith, as well as the Hoyas, who the Varsity Eight defeated by a 6.4-second margin to win the Class of 1999 Cup for the first time in five years.Radcliffe saw its national rank rise as high as No. 2 after its open-water win against Princeton on April 25, one week after coming up just 1.53 seconds short against No. 3 Stanford.“That was a really big win for us because, in its 11-year history, we had only won [that race] once before this year,” Kharazzi said.But the Black and White could not prevail against No. 1 Wisconsin —which also claimed first place in the EAWRC Sprints on May 17—as the Badgers won the Knect Cup on April 11 with a margin of just over 10 seconds.Though the Black and White finished in a disappointing fourth place in the Grand Final of the EAWRC Springs, Radcliffe will return to the Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Championships on June 4 in Sacramento, Calif.At Sprints, it was largely the same story, with Wisconsin dominating the field, except that Princeton and Georgetown were able to avenge their dual season losses in the Grand Final, which saw Radcliffe finish fourth with a time of 6:57.341 and 28.7 team points.But the Black and White are determined that the letdown will not be repeated early next month when many of the same crews compete for the national championship.—Staff writer Robert T. Hamlin can be reached at rhamlin@fas.harvard.edu.

Coming off a year in which the alpine squad was forced to enter many early-season contests with no coach at the helm, the only way the Harvard skiing team appeared to be able to go in its 2008-09 campaign was up. But with a rash of injuries and a few team members taking temporary leaves of absence, the Crimson’s results actually worsened this year, as the team’s consistent ninth-place finishes of 2007-08 were replaced with 10th-place efforts this winter. But despite these poor results, the Harvard skiing team performed much more competitively in comparison to its fellow New England colleges this year. While the season’s first five carnivals were marked with 10th-place efforts, the Crimson’s alpine and nordic squads combined to place ninth at their final competition of the winter, the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Championship in Sugarloaf, Maine. The men’s alpine and women’s nordic teams led the way for Harvard this year, often earning the most points for the team at its weekly carnivals throughout New England. The men’s alpine squad’s performances this winter were especially promising with so many underclassmen stepping up and contributing to the team’s efforts. “On a whole, I think the team performed well this year, based on our situation,” said men’s alpine junior captain Chris Kinner. “It was a tough season for the freshmen, coming into the big leagues of skiing for the first time, but the sophomore guys had a great year. They really improved in their racing skills and helped the team a great deal.” The women’s alpine squad faced an especially daunting task this year, with only one active female member competing on a weekly basis. “With Tess Wood out from competitions with an injury, Caroline McHugh was the only girl competing for us, which meant that no matter how well she skied, she just did not have enough help to improve her team’s finish,” Kinner said. The alpine squad welcomes five additional team members next winter, with three freshman recruits coming in and another pair of skiers returning from time spent away from the team or school. This added depth should only help the alpine contingents continue to close the distance between them and other collegiate alpine skiing programs throughout the region. “Everyone has to step up next year,” Kinner said. “I’d really like our team to get out of ninth place and beat St. Michael’s College on a consistent basis. Getting any higher than eighth place would require a lot of work, but I think we will definitely improve next year with a bigger squad.” The women’s nordic team, with a mix of talented underclassmen and seasoned veterans, had one of its best years in recent memory. The contingent was the largest of Harvard’s four skiing squads and often placed the highest among the four at weekly carnivals. “We had a pretty strong girls’ team,” said men’s nordic junior Joe Tofte. “They skied well all year and should continue to place well next year.”The men’s nordic squad, meanwhile, suffered from a rather small squad size and was not able to match the efforts of its female counterpart. “We had a small team this year, consisting of only four guys,” Tofte said. “But based on our situation, we actually skied pretty well this year. We have a couple good recruits coming in next year as well, so we should be able to build on our finishes this year.” Overall, despite Harvard skiing’s presence at the back of the pack among New England collegiate programs this winter, the Crimson looks to improve next year having gained valuable experience throughout the 2008-09 campaign.—Staff writer Thomas D.

The Harvard men’s water polo team showed marked improvement through the 2008 season, but the Crimson could not manage to demonstrate its growth in the win column. The young squad struggled often in its fall campaign, amassing a 5-12 (3-5 ECAC) record before ending the season with a sixth-place finish at the Northern Division Championships at MIT in November.“We’re definitely not satisfied with the outcome this past season,” junior Egan Atkinson said, referring to the regression in the team’s record following a 14-16 effort in 2007. “In terms of the trajectory of the team, though, we’re much better.”Harvard certainly hopes to take some positives out of a difficult year, which included heartbreaking overtime losses to then-No. 19 Brown at home in October and to MIT in the Northern Championships.Although the Crimson began the year 2-1 and looked to be adjusting well to head coach Erik Farrar’s new system, the squad struggled mightily with transition defense, prompting an eight-game losing streak. But rather than give into frustration, Harvard tightened its play and went 3-3 over its final six games, an encouraging sign for 2009.“Guys for the most part tried to focus on what we weren’t doing well,” sophomore Bret Voith said. “We didn’t necessarily see the results of our adjustments within the season, but…beginning next August I think there will be improvements.”New captains Atkinson and Voith will lead the charge after enjoying breakout seasons for the Crimson, earning Most Improved Player and the Coaches’ Award respectively at the team banquet. But while Harvard graduates only two seniors, it will lose crucial contributors in co-captains Jay Connolly and David Tune.“David and Connolly are going to be completely irreplaceable,” Atkinson said. “Those guys were huge to this team in many ways. They were superior leaders but also outstanding water polo players.”Connolly—a two-time All-Northern Division goalie—notched 113 saves in his final season, as well as his first goal, often keeping an overwhelmed defense in the game.For his part, Tune anchored the offense from his utility position. The standout bore the brunt of opposing defenses by occupying the middle of the offensive zone and routinely shrugged off defenders to net 31 goals in 18 games.“Last year [Tune] was incredible,” Voith said. “He was there day in and day out…and he and Jay were both phenomenal.” While the captains carried much of the load for the Crimson during the season, the squad’s youth also demonstrated tremendous talent. Team Rookie of the Year Luka Babic tallied 12 goals on the season, and Voith added 20 in only his second campaign.With a strong youth movement and another year of experience with a new system, the Crimson can anticipate a successful turnaround in the fall. But it will have to accomplish its goals without the help of two program stalwarts. Assistant coaches Ellen Estes Lee and Rick Offsay will depart after two and eight years with the team, respectively, with four of Offsay’s coming as a player. Whereas Farrar credits Offsay with influencing two generations of Harvard water polo players, he also points to Lee’s experience as a two-time Olympian as a driving force behind any improvement.“It’s impossible to overstate the impact [these coaches] have had,” Farrar said. “We have a giant vacuum where two of the very best assistant coaches in the NCAA used to be.”The squad will undoubtedly feel the loss of both its coaches and key seniors, but Voith summarized Harvard’s optimism that a disappointing season will not go to waste.“I think that no one on our team is happy with how we did,” he said. “But in the scheme of things, all the returning players will use last year as motivation going forward to make sure that we make significant improvements for next season.”—Staff writer Max N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduating fifth-year senior Chris Pizzotti is living the high life right now. Having completed one of the greatest Harvard football careers in history, Pizzotti is now vying for a backup quarterback role behind Mark Sanchez with the New York Jets. For a guy who’s been part of three Ivy League Championship teams, this is an appropriate punctuation to an already-stellar career.“Chris Pizzotti is the best football player...to ever play at Harvard,” outgoing captain Matt Curtis said. “He’s the most winning quarterback in Harvard history. We had a lot of really good players who had a lot of personal recognition, but Chris Pizzotti was the best player on the team. If we don’t have him, we don’t win two Ivy League championships. More important than just being a good player on the field, he’s the best teammate I’ve ever had. I can’t say enough about him—words can’t express what he means to Harvard football.”Though Pizzotti’s collegiate trajectory was unconventional—getting the start sophomore year, only to be replaced by classmate Liam O’Hagan midway through the year, and then reclaiming the No. 1 spot midway through his junior year—the Reading, Mass. native iced his role as Harvard’s leading man this season.“I wasn’t always having success in terms of getting out on the field,” Pizzotti said of his early days with the team. “But the last two years, winning the Ivy title back-to-back is a dream come true.”In his final performance at the helm of the Crimson offense against Yale in The Game, Pizzotti looked like an NFL-caliber quarterback. Up against the nation’s top defense in terms of points allowed, in addition to driving 30 mile-per-hour winds and single-digit temperatures, Pizzotti led Harvard in a convincing 10-0 victory over the Bulldogs.But as decisively as the season ended, the beginning was not so clean.In the Crimson’s annual night game against Holy Cross to kick off the 2008 campaign, Pizzotti committed four turnovers. But heading into the fourth quarter down, 17-6, Pizzotti buckled down to notch three final-frame touchdowns—one by air, two by land—to edge out the Crusaders, 25-24. He finished the day with 370 passing yards in the spectacular comeback.In the next contest against Brown, Pizzotti kept a drive alive as the clock wore down, setting Harvard up for a touchdown to bring the team within two. But a failed two-point conversion resulted in a 24-22 loss to the Bears.As the season progressed, that loss to Brown began to fester, nagging at Harvard’s Ivy title hopes. But Pizzotti kept the team in the hunt, averaging roughly 250 yards per game and rolling past both league and non-league foes.In the third-to-last week of the season, Pizzotti notched a record game when it counted most. Against Columbia, Pizzotti passed 25-of-40 for a career-best 376 yards and four touchdowns. He also spread the wealth among his receivers, connecting with both sophomore Levi Richards and junior Matt Luft for more than 100 yards.“We knew that Columbia’s defense was high risk, high reward,” Pizzotti said. “We caught them in some blitzes sometimes...It showed the depth of our receiving corps that [Luft and Richards] got 100 yards.” In the same week, Yale topped the Bears to open up a chance for the Crimson to take a share of the Ivy League Championship, barring losses to either Penn or the Bulldogs—two of the better programs in the Ancient Eight.“We knew all we needed was a slight opening of the door,” Pizzotti said. “We went down to the locker room and watched film every night. We weren’t going to let anything get in the way of us being Ivy champions again.”And Pizzotti answered the call. In Harvard’s 24-21 victory over Penn, the Crimson held the ball for just 20:19, but Pizzotti worked efficiently, passing 16-of-23 for 156 yards and two touchdowns.With the shutout of Yale in The Game, Harvard and Pizzotti earned their second consecutive Ivy title, the first back-to-back championships for the Crimson since 1982-83.And Pizzotti’s hard work and persistence paid off, as he’s now fighting to make it out of Jets camp and extend his football career. “It is a little interesting,” Pizzotti said of playing with the Jets. “Growing up, I was always a die-hard Patriots fan. I’ve been taking a lot of heat from my friends and family.”—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

It was the most basic of stories—one of the underdog defying the longest of odds. Sports are usually pretty good for that, actually. In the context of running and jumping, catching and throwing, we often derive some greater meaning out of the athletic exploits we engage in (or, as was the case for me, write about).
But sometimes, life can be a microcosm of sports, too. When a kid loses both parents, lives an adolescence defined by constant change, and uses his naivety to break down the barriers of segregation, we assign to him the most fundamental tenets of sport: winner, champion, victor.
This is not my story. It’s the life of a boy named Jeffrey, the protagonist in one of the greatest stories ever told. An orphan with nothing, he’s best known as Maniac Magee, the title character from Jerry Spinelli’s timeless Scholastic classic.
For the children he meets, he is their version of the ideal, engaging in their playground games so effortlessly and with such prowess that he becomes legendary. 
He runs fast, jumps high, hits home runs and catches touchdowns. For them, it is sport as life.
For the adults, he is something else: a uniter, someone who brings people together, someone who accepts people despite their flaws in order to accomplish a lofty goal in the face of long odds. For them, it is life as sport.
I tell Jeffrey’s story not as an example comparative to my own, but because I have done my best to apply the lessons learned from Maniac Magee during the past four years. We sportswriters are the aspirant athletes who were not blessed with the skills to excel on the playing field. Instead of playing, we do the best we can to engage ourselves in the pursuit of victory that we enjoy so very much, in the closest way possible.
The single commonality shared by each of my colleagues on The Crimson’s Sports Board for the past four years is a love of the craft. That love of the craft of sports has translated into a life choice, the choice of this institution as our principal extracurricular exploit. The pursuit of writing, editing, and reporting has symbolized the very events we cover: we aim to be our best, engage in (friendly) rivalry with publications both down the street and down the interstate, and we become close because of our mutual goal to make the best product possible every day.
Sometimes, though, it’s even simpler than that. Sport is life in our basic joy—even if such an emotion is a violation of our ethics as journalists. I will never forget the moment, nearly four years ago, that crystallized this reality for me.
As a humble freshman, lacking even front-door access to the organization I would one day lead, I traveled down the road for a Game. A Denver native, I didn’t understand the significance of The Game, but my love of football brought me there. 
And in New Haven, on a late November day as the sun set, my fellow writers and I did not intend to learn a life lesson, and we entered the Yale Bowl with no hopes of deriving any great meaning—nor did it ever come.
But what did come was a shriek of unbridled joy from the mouth of one of my colleagues, in response to the remarkable fourth overtime turnover in the triple-overtime edition of The Game that still sits with me as the most amazing athletic competition I’ve ever seen in person.
On that day (which ultimately turned into night), there was no greater meaning to what happened on the field. All in the stadium were privileged, and the outcome didn’t even deliver trophies to the ultimate victors. On some level, it wasn’t even about The Game—it was the game that we really cared about.
I guess that’s still sport as life, though. That’s certainly the case for Jeffrey, who never quite understood why a white kid catching passes from a black kid on the “black” side of town was such an extraordinary achievement. For him, it was the simple joy of being able to run, to compete and not to worry about anything else in the process.
Perhaps that’s something we should keep in mind more often. We as sportswriters are among the most guilty of describing a performance as “heroic,” or writing about the “battles” in the “trenches” during a contest between students. We’d be remiss not to acknowledge these things for what they really are, too—just games.
Sometimes they do matter more than that. Sometimes there’s greater meaning to be found in athletics. Sports can break social barriers and make broader statements, as Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, or Maniac Magee would be quick to tell you. 
But just like in life, sometimes we just love things for their core value, and we keep coming back not because of anything other than what they are in their most fundamental forms.
There’s meaning in being first, the champ, or even a maniac. But there’s meaning in simply doing (or watching, or writing about) what we love, too.
That’s what I did, and I’m so much better off as a result.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On paper, it seemed like the 2008 edition of the Harvard football team was the class of the Ivy League. And in reality, the Crimson proved to be just that.Led by fifth-year senior quarterback Chris Pizzotti and a defense with a wealth of experience, Harvard finished this year’s campaign 9-1 (6-1 Ivy) to successfully defend its Ancient Eight title. “It was a great season, the first Harvard football team in 25 years to win back-to-back Ivy League titles,” captain Matt Curtis said. “That’s the goal for Harvard football every year, to win the championship, and we accomplished that goal.”Turnovers and mistakes plagued the Crimson in its early-season matchups, but a fourth-quarter charge in the season opener against Holy Cross allowed Harvard to come away with the 25-24 win. Pizzotti scored two running touchdowns in the last 6:16 to lead his team out of a 24-12 hole to victory—the first of four Crimson wins to be decided by four points or less.“Every time you open up the season, you want to start on the right foot,” Pizzotti said. “I think that game really set the tone for the season. No matter what position we were in, whenever we were in a hole, we could get out.”But things didn’t go so well in the Crimson’s Ivy opener against Brown, and on that rainy September afternoon, the goal of repeating as Ivy League champions suddenly seemed a lot harder to attain.Though Harvard jumped out to an early lead, a missed extra point and three fumbles put the Crimson in a 24-16 hole in the fourth.With a minute left to play, Harvard looked to have seized the momentum. Backup quarterback Liam O’Hagan found junior Matt Luft in the endzone to pull the Crimson within two points of the Bears.But Harvard was stopped short on its two-point conversion attempt, letting Brown walk away with the 24-22 win, its first against the Crimson in nine years. “You always learn more about your team from a loss than any win,” Curtis said. “We had some holes, we had an opportunity to win the game...They were a good team and we caught them on  a good day.”Harvard took the lessons learned against the Bears to heart, rattling off eight straight victories to finish the season. The Crimson’s experienced starters led the team to close wins over Lehigh and Princeton, while its depth of talent proved crucial to keep pace in the Ancient Eight.The season’s penultimate game pitted Harvard against another one-loss squad in Penn. After jumping out to a 17-0 third-quarter lead, the Crimson let the Quakers back in, and the lead narrowed to 24-21 with less than five minutes to play.Penn was threatening at the Harvard 12-yard line with 20 seconds on the clock when senior Ryan Barnes pulled down his third interception of the day—this one in the endzone to seal the victory. The win at Franklin Field set up Harvard for a shot at the Ivy title against Yale in the 125th edition of The Game.The single-digit temperatures and 30 mile-per-hour winds stalled the Crimson’s potent passing offense, as Pizzotti was just 12-for-21 for 109 yards on the afternoon.With Harvard forced to turn to its running game—a weakness for the team all season—Gino Gordon stepped up. The sophomore carried the ball 39 times for 168 yards and the game’s only touchdown.“[Coach Tim Murphy] said, ‘If we run the ball well, we’ll win the game,’” Gordon said after the game. “The offensive line, they stepped up, they had huge holes, and I pretty much just ran through them all day.”Once again, Harvard was anchored by its defense, which held Yale scoreless on seven straight snaps inside the 10-yard line late in the fourth quarter to preserve the 10-0 victory and the championship. With the departure of such a talented class of 2009, it seems like an era of Crimson football is coming to a close. But fittingly, the seniors ended their careers exactly as they were expected to—as champions. —Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As sports journalists, we get the unique opportunity to explore the pivotal moments in games, seasons, and programs. But no matter the twists and turns, with journalistic integrity on the line we feign indifference, pretending that outcomes don’t affect us even as we affect their perception.
Yet as writers, we form connections to these outcomes in ways unexpected and in many ways different from the average fan. We pour over statistics, trends, and interview transcripts, looking for the right angles to take. We form fascinations—obsessions, even—with the development of the programs and athletes that go largely unrecognized by anyone beyond the Crimson Crazies. And for many of us, Harvard sports become intertwined with our lives.
*
Sitting in Harvard Stadium for the first time, I was underwhelmed. The Crimson started the day by laying an egg and falling behind Brown, 16-0, in the first quarter. Accustomed to a more solid brand of football, I became slightly disenchanted with my college football prospects. Never one to leave sporting events early, I resorted to restlessly checking baseball scores on my cell phone and chatting with the people around me.
I got the usual “Wow, you know a lot about sports,” a phrase with which every female sports fan is all too familiar. But before I could give my usual spiel about box scores and baseball, one of them said, “You should comp The Crimson.” 
I began to weigh the statement I had initially deemed ridiculous: could I, a premed who had never written a story in her life, add anything to one of the best college newspapers in the country? 
While I did so, the Crimson began to mount a comeback. As the double overtime victory—the Bears’ only blemish on an otherwise perfect Ivy League Championship season—came to a close, my passion for Harvard football was just beginning. 
The next day I went to a sports meeting, picked up a football preview, and began my four-year foray into sports journalism.
*
Sitting in the Yale Bowl press box two years later, I looked down on a scarcely populated stadium and a blowout game. The most anticipated meeting of the Crimson and Bulldogs since 1968 had produced one of the more lopsided wins in the storied rivalry’s history. 
Having spent nearly every weekend covering football, I knew the team pretty well. I knew its tendency to play down to the level of the mediocre teams it faced, I knew its struggles to close out close games, and I knew it had to stop Yale running back Mike McLeod to have any chance. I knew this all too well—I had written columns about it in the weeks leading up to The Game.
But the first two problems became nearly instantly meaningless, since Harvard coach Tim Murphy had clearly solved the third. The Crimson had a 27-0 lead by halftime and went on to win, 37-6, and claim its first Ivy League Championship since 2005. 
As students started filing in from the tailgate mid-third quarter realizing they had missed almost the entirety of the game, I began writing my story—one of the stories hundreds of people would have to read in order to actually find out what happened; a story about the keys to the game from my point of view.
*
Harvard football is initially what drew me in to the world of Crimson sports, it’s what held my interest, and it’s in large part what led to over 130 stories, nearly 20 road trips, and two executive positions. 
As much as we may try to remove ourselves from the sports we cover, as those responsible for conveying trends and outcomes, our passion and devotion for our beats is what ultimately makes us successful. 
Commiserating with my fellow sports writers, fawning over players, cringing with injuries, and feeling excitement after Ancient Eight championships all played an integral role in my continued commitment to writing.
But with this, my final column, I officially cut myself off from the writing world and retire to life as a fan—a role I’m beginning to realize is not so different from what I’ve been the last four years.

Quadlings have faced a lot of hard times recently, losing their library, café and potentially some of their shuttle service.  However quadlings can now drown their woes with delicious fro-yo.  Berryline—a beloved staple in the diets of River dwellers—has come to the quad!  Berryline’s new location is on Mass Ave going towards Porter Square, right next to a Starbucks.
FlyBy wandered over to the new location that opened a couple of weeks ago today…hear about our findings after the jump.
The new location is still slightly unfinished.  There is no real sign outside yet—only a whiteboard and a poster, so it is easy to miss.  The inside is decorated with familiar paintings of bug-eyed yogurt creatures and is a lot more bright and spacious than the arrow street location.  The walls are lined with bamboo, there are skylights, large windows and 3 tables for patrons to sit at while they devour  their froyo.   And of course there’s free Wifi, which FlyBy loves.


Owner Matthew Wallace said that the new location’s purpose was to expand (of course), as well as draw some of the crowd away from the other location.  “This new location’s aim is to be more family oriented, as well as stroller and handicap friendly.  Our old location was mostly frequented by Harvard students, and more convenient for Harvard students.  A lot of families that lived near by had to come pretty far.”
Right now the menu is pretty in-line with the Arrow Street location, except with different flavors (Blueberry and Peanut Butter, currently) and a cool mango smoothie.   Eventually, however, Matt says they will incorporate an entire new smoothie menu.   The new location, when finished, will have window seats at a bar, and much more seating in the form of benches around the walls.  The owner joked about how people sitting along the street at the Arrow street location was actually a fire hazard:  “We want this to be a more of a sit down place, while the Arrow Street one is more of a to-go place,” Matt said.
A consolation prize, Quadlings? You have to take what get, right?
