After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CARY, N.C.—After coming back home after my last spring-semester final exam, my friend and I drove to a Lowes Foods-anchored strip mall and ordered bubble tea, mine taro flavor with nata jelly and red bean, hers green tea snow cream. We sat on stone benches outside of a State Farm and talked about our college lives.
Before moving away from Cary, I used to instead satisfy my bubble tea cravings by buying the pearls and tea bags from our local Asian food market and brewing it in pots on the stove. I’d never gone out and purchased bubble tea with a friend; I didn’t have the option to. But now, I can, and I did—at Kung Fu Tea, the second bubble tea joint in my hometown, a chain that, after two semesters of going to college in the Boston area, I recognized.
And, in Cary, it’s not only bubble tea that’s new. When I went home I saw countless restaurants on Yelp that I hadn’t even heard of before. I drove on streets that didn’t previously exist and bought groceries at new supermarkets. I saw kombucha sold in Cary for the first time, and fewer and fewer parking spots at the gym my family goes to.
But this feeling—a feeling of coming home to constant change—is familiar. Beginning when I was in late elementary school, my family and I would take summer trips to China to see family, trips that were three or four years apart. I separate these trips in my head by the new things in China each time: In 2008, there was my first trip back and the Olympics; in 2014, there was the new high-speed train system that eliminated the need for 30-hour long sleeper car train rides to my mom’s hometown; in 2017, there were mobile payments and bike sharing. But just as I saw China change in four-year periods, I am now seeing Cary change in periods of three or four months between short college breaks; I just didn’t notice it before when I lived there year-round. Every time I go back, there is something different, something else I have to learn about the town.
The phrase “coming home” has a connotation of something familiar and stable, like a soft couch you sit in after a long and full day, where you get to eat all your parents’ food that you miss, see old friends, and go back to familiar places to let all the memories wash over you. I love coming home for these reasons, but city-wise, it feels like home is the one that is changing, while Cambridge—specifically Harvard—feels like the static, stable place that I come back to. In this way, for me, the roles of hometown and college town are reversed, and I can’t tell whether it’s good or bad, because it’s just different.
I was in Cary for two weeks at the beginning of the summer. I’m away now, and when I go back home in two months, maybe there’ll be something new I’ll have to learn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Art Museums appointed Soyoung Lee—currently a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York—as its new chief curator earlier this week.
Lee will assume her role starting Sept. 24. Lee first joined the Met in 2003 as its first curator for Korean art, and in her 15-year career, has served as curator, associate curator, and assistant curator in the Department of Asian Art.
Martha Tedeschi, director of the Harvard Art Museums, said the museum intends to launch several new initiatives under its new curator.
“We’re undergoing a period of strategic planning this summer,” Tedeschi said.
Tedeschi said the museum is looking to revamp its training programs, as well as those that provide “pathways to the museum field”—including high school programs and postdoctoral fellowships.
Tedeschi said Lee will be instrumental in the review process to create an “up to date and effective pathway into the field.”
Tedeschi also said Lee will be responsible for overseeing the development of areas that had previously fallen outside the museum’s focus, including pieces from people of color or those “of a particular medium that has been undervalued in the past.”
“It is hard for an individual curator embedded in the field to see the institutional needs,” Tedeschi said.
The chief curator, however, should have an idea of the bigger picture and be able to nurture the necessary discussion across departments, according to Tedeschi.
Lee has organized a number of international loan exhibitions, and is currently collaborating  with colleagues at the Met on two major cross-departmental exhibitions—to debut in fall 2018 and spring 2020, according to a press release.
From 2016 to 2017, Lee served as chair of the Met’s Forum of Curators, Conservators, and Scientists and currently serves on the museum’s Diversity and Inclusion Task Force and the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee to the President.
She is also a trustee-at-large for the Association of Art Museum Curators and one of twelve fellows in the Center for Curatorial Leadership’s 2018 cohort.
According to a press release, her research interests encompass “cross-cultural exchanges in East Asian art and culture.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of pages of court filings made public last week revealed previously unknown details of the process by which Harvard admissions officers rank applicants—but withheld certain information, including the “distinguishing excellences” that the College looks for in top students.
Documents penned by the University’s lawyers and a Harvard-paid expert contain over 20 redacted references to information about the admissions process, including the qualifications or traits that will earn applicants  high marks from the admissions committee.
Friday’s filings mark the latest development in a lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions first filed the lawsuit in 2014.
In a brief filed in March, lawyers for the University argued that revealing “highly proprietary” details could compromise the College’s admissions system.
“Publicizing this information would cause applicants and college consultants to seek to orient their applications to what they perceive Harvard wants, to the detriment of the authenticity of the information Harvard receives and its ability to make its best judgments,” that briefing reads.
Last Friday’s filings—which outline what Harvard considers undisputed facts in the case and argue that the University does not discriminate against Asian-American College hopefuls—reveal that admissions officers assign applicants scores ranging from “1” to “6” in approximately 14 categories, including academic achievement, extracurricular involvement, athletic prowess, strength of character, teacher recommendations, counselor recommendations, and “personal” and “overall” ratings. “1” is the highest possible score a candidate can receive in each category.
Lawyers redacted sections of filings outlining what specific qualities or achievements allow candidates to garner a “1” in categories including academics and extracurriculars. But Harvard left unredacted some descriptions of the ratings system.
The documents report that an applicant who receives a “1” academic rating usually “has submitted academic work of some kind that is reviewed by a faculty member,” but redacted a more detailed description of what constitutes a “1.” A candidate with a “2+” academic rating typically has “perfect, or near-perfect, grades and testing, but no evidence of substantial scholarship or academic creativity,” per the documents.
Lawyers redacted information about what constitutes a “1” in extracurriculars, although they left visible guidelines about who typically receives a “2”: someone who has “significant school, and possibly regional accomplishments,” like a student who is “student body president or captain of the debate team and the leader of multiple additional clubs.”
Harvard’s redactions not only included guidelines about how to grade applicants, but also numerous quotes from the Casebook Discussion Guide and Interviewer Handbook—training aids used to teach admissions officers how to evaluate Harvard hopefuls. In one instance, Harvard’s lawyers write that a “variety of examples from applications in the Casebook” demonstrate “the wide variety of factors Harvard considers in order to distinguish among the many academically strong candidates in its pool.”
Although the document goes on to list some of these factors, direct quotes from the Casebook are redacted.
Other redacted filings included do not seem to include sensitive material about Harvard’s admissions process but rather personal details of students whose unsuccessful applications form the basis for the lawsuit. In more than 10 places throughout the filings, names of candidates whose admissions files were specifically mentioned as part of the suit are blacked out.
Lawyers from Harvard and SFFA conferred to determine which portions of the documents to redact before submitting their filings Friday—and it is possible that Judge Allison D. Burroughs could decide to remove some of the redactions in the future.
A filing submitted jointly by Harvard and SFFA dictates that, if the parties cannot agree whether to redact certain parts of the filings, the Court must decide.  Burroughs could choose to remove redactions from some of the material that Harvard or SFFA blacked out, if the other side argues it should not be redacted.
The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in October. Although both sides asked Burroughs to issue a summary judgment beforehand, many experts—and Burroughs herself—have said that is unlikely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Newton mayor Setti Warren will be joining the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy in July as its next executive director.
Center Director Nicco Mele announced Warren’s appointment in an email Thursday. Warren will be replacing Nancy Palmer, the Center’s retiring longtime executive director.
Mele said as executive director, Warren will not only be responsible for the daily operations of the Center, but will also be in charge of helping him “set strategy and direction.”
Warren previously served as the mayor of Newton, Mass. from 2010 to 2018 and entered the 2018 governor’s race as a Democrat, before dropping out in April due to a lack of funds and poor name recognition among voters.
Mele said that although choosing the center’s next leader was a “tough decision” among a “strong group of finalists,” Warren stood out for his leadership ability as the mayor of a city and for his various roles in higher education and politics.
“Being a mayor is both about kind of the politics and the vision but also about the nitty-gritty and the details, and that combination is just a rare one,” Mele said.
Warren also served in the Clinton White House, was active duty in Iraq from 2007 to 2008, and served as an intelligence specialist in the U.S. Navy Reserve.
Warren said he was “excited” to begin his role at the Center because of  the “critical mission” it has to study “how people learn facts,” citing several Shorenstein Center projects around information disorder, new media platforms, and issues within the field of journalism.
"All of those areas are incredibly exciting because they are a part of the issues of our time, of today,” Warren said. “How are we, as a democratic society, going to be able to learn what the facts are and make principled decisions around them? The Center is in fact right in the middle of that.”
Warren also said he was “thrilled” to join the Shorenstein Center at this time, as the research institute prepares to launch several long-term research projects during the upcoming midterm and presidential elections.
“I'm thrilled that I will have the opportunity to work with an incredibly talented team led by Nicco, who is a real visionary when it comes to many of these issues,” Warren added. “I saw an opportunity to come in and be able to scale up the Center and to make sure it grows in a strategic fashion."
