After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"When did you decide to become a writer?" academic philosopher Donald (Sope Dirisu) asks orphan, aspiring writer, and former maid Jane Fairchild as she struggles with writers’ block in Eva Husson’s film “Mothering Sunday.” Adapted from Graham Swift’s 2016 novel of the same name, the film follows Jane (Odessa Young) through three different stages of her eventual writing career, each woven together through lush flashbacks.
"Mothering Sunday" takes place in three different decades across the 20th century, reminiscent of the sensual slow burn of "Normal People" (both films shared the same screenwriter — Alice Birch), and also the charming scenery and British set design of classic Jane Austen adaptations. When we first meet Jane in the summer of 1924, she's a maid for the Nivens — a couple played by Olivia Colman and Colin Firth — one of three rich Berkshire families who have been longtime friends. Despite this, Jane’s true interests lie with the Sheringhams, whose son, Paul (Josh O’Connor), is the only surviving son of the wealthy family trio post-World War I. Paul is betrothed to Emma Hobday (Emma D’Arcy), the trio’s only other living child, but Paul’s affections are reserved instead for Jane, with whom he has an intoxicating affair.
The film follows Jane on Mother’s Day (or Mothering Sunday) in the summer of 1924. While Jane is given the day off to explore, Paul invites her over for a tryst. Bright summer sunlight gives the scene a vibrant, gauzy feel — an ethereal setting for the blossoming love between the two actors. Their relationship celebrates rich sensuality without concern for shame or censorship. As Jane aptly tells Paul, the tone captures more of “aching” than anything exploitative or cheap.
That day with Paul was the first of three stages in Jane’s life that answers why she decided to become a writer. It also seems to be the answer that Husson seems most interested in: Instead of building a clearer connection between the three different plotlines, Husson relegates the other two (one being her relationship with Donald) to the realm of haphazard coverage. In choosing to tell Jane’s life through a collage of memories across timelines, Husson's film often fumbles when the intertwining plot points aren’t as clear as they should be. And as a result, the resolution of these three stages of Jane's life feels awkward and unearned come the film's end.
Still, the film is so technically beautiful — filled to the brim with vibrant, lush imagery — that any temporal missteps do little do detract from the film’s many successes. As a critique of class, for example, “Mothering Sunday” provides a compelling view of the ways freedom and pleasure are often inextricably tied to status. For example, in a scene repeated throughout the film, Jane pretends to be the mistress of the Shermingham’s estate, walking around naked, perusing the bookshelves and eating their pie without a care in the world.
Above all, however, “Mothering Sunday” is a film about grief — both the ability and inability to mourn, and what it means for someone to mourn. By focusing on families sending sons to the war, the film explores grief not just on a collective scale, but also peers into how it affects individual families, individual relationships. Mrs. Niven, for example, is largely emotionless, almost catatonic, when it comes to her relationship with her husband and the other families — a far cry from the joyful and candid person Paul remembers from before the war. Emma and Milly (Patsy Ferran), Jane’s fellow maid at the Niven house too, are held up as case studies in grief, with both of the women being forced to mourn their soon-to-be-fiancés only as one could mourn a friend.
So concerned is the film with grief that Mrs. Niven even tells Jane to be grateful for her being an orphan, for being “totally bereaved from birth.” “You have nothing to lose and never shall,” she tells Jane during a particularly gripping performance from Coleman. Though, of course, the film soon proves through a series of tragedies that such an immunity to grief couldn’t be further from the truth.
And while Jane is told over and over (mainly by Donald) that immeasurable heartache is a prerequisite to becoming a great writer, audiences never get the chance to see that grief put into action as an ingredient for her prophesied greatness outside of short, incongruous flashes of an older Jane clicking away on a typewriter. Of course, showing a thorough writing process in the film would have been a bore for audiences, but it would have made the film so much more cohesive if viewers were shown even slightly more insight into Jane’s process as a writer, and how “total bereavement” was necessary for her. Husson would have made Jane's writing career significantly more believable, since as the film exists, Jane's writing feels more like a trope than a reflection of her character.
In its many triumphs, “Mothering Sunday” proves a strong next step for Husson as she continues to develop her career as a filmmaker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though they may seem like polar opposites, sexual intimacy and social isolation are closely intertwined — and the Covid-19 pandemic has only complicated that intricate relationship in the digital age. Young people, it seems, have been impacted the most, as our default form of communication encourages detachment as much as it does connection.
In “Les Olympiades” (or “Paris, 13th District”), which premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, director Jacques Audiard explores these relationships through the stories of three residents in the titular Parisian neighborhood. Shot in a romantic, sultry black-and-white, the veteran director’s latest film is charming, moody, and refreshingly unassuming as it delves into the realities of intimacy in the modern world.
The French-Chinese call-center worker and post-graduate Émilie (Lucie Zhang), English teacher and doctoral student Camille (Makita Samba), and the 33-year-old law student Nora (“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” breakout Noémie Merlant) are all outcasts in their own way. They are impacted by the social isolation of the digital age and the oft overwhelming loneliness of life in a big city. Much like the separation felt by the film's subjects, "Les Olympiades" situates audiences on the outside, looking in from a distance — with only fleeting, almost episodic glimpses into each of the characters' genuine attempts at love, and the losses that follow. Audiard passes little judgement upon his characters, with audiences instead treated to a loose collection of coincidences and narrative quirks that bring Camille, Émilie, and Nora together in interesting and ever-evolving ways.
The screenplay — co-written by Audiard, Léa Mysius, and Céline Sciamma (“Portrait of a Lady on Fire”) — is adapted from some of the short stories in U.S. cartoonist Adrian Tomine’s 2015 comic collection, “Killing and Dying.” It mostly unfolds in one apartment block, focusing on the intersections between the three millennials, but told almost exclusively through unspoken words and stolen or lingering glances. The result is a convoluted mesh of relationships where, for much of the film, Émilie loves Camille, Camille loves Nora, and Nora loves cam girl Amber Sweet (French singer-songwriter Jehnny Beth), whom she connects with after being mistaken for the sex worker at a law school party. Throughout, the most obvious of the intersections between these characters is sex and their constantly evolving relationships with it.
As the central theme of the film, sex is also the main way in which characters are introduced. We first meet Camille, for example, when he responds to Émilie’s solicitation for a roommate, and, after she invites him in, shares that he “channels professional frustration into intense sexual activity.” When he starts asking her more questions about her own life, she responds “fuck first, ask later.” (Though, when he asks what that means, she says she was simply reciting an old Chinese proverb about shoes and feet.) Immediately after, they begin a passionate, if short-lived, sexual relationship that manages to linger long after it’s over.
In a story where sex often happens before characters fully know one another, the connections they form are fraught and volatile. And it’s the heartbreaking, lonely, or stoic aftermath of their desire that drives the characters through the film to the end. Still, it is also through their relationships to sex that “Les Olympiades” allows its characters to actually learn about each other. As the four characters — Amber included — are caught in a constantly shifting web of relationships and sexual partners, the sex they have (or don’t have) is crucial to their narrative arcs. Nora and Camille’s relationship in the bedroom, to cite a notable example, is what ultimately lays bare Nora’s insecurities when it comes to sex, allowing her room to grow as the film progresses.
That the sex — beautifully choreographed in the film’s many extensive sex scenes by Stéphanie Chêne — is truly vital to the characters and the story itself is a fact that Audiard never shies away from. It is both what dictates the stories that make up the essential fabric of “Les Olympiades,” and what makes Audiard’s competition selection so compelling a watch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is about “desire, desire, desire, and more desire.” That’s how a Sorbonne literature professor introduces Arabic poetry to her students at the beginning of Tunisian screenwriter-director Leyla Bouzid’s latest film, “Une Histoire d’Amour et de Désir” (“A Tale of Love and Desire”), which premiered on July 14 at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. The film can be described in much the same way.
“Une Histoire” follows reserved French Algerian college student Ahmed (Sami Outalbali (“Sex Education”)) and the lively, magnetic Farah (Zbeida Belhajamor), a Tunisian student whom Ahmed first sees in his Arabic poetry class. The chemistry between the pair is palpable from the very beginning, and the film wastes little time in establishing them as lovers — physical ones, at that. Therein lies the central tension of “Une Histoire,” and the one that Bouzid appears most interested in: Ahmed’s relationship to sex is a complicated one, repressed by internalized misconceptions of purity and respect. Farah, on the other hand, acts as the foil to Ahmed, providing a fresh and unrestricted look at physical desire not as a shameful act but as a very manifestation of the love Ahmed tries so desperately to keep sacred, often at his own expense.
Throughout the film, Bouzid expertly teases out this tension in Ahmed and Farah’s relationship, creating a high-strung, slow burn of an exploration into the complex spaces between sex and love, between divinity and desire. In one of the best moments of the film, Bouzid lays bare all these intersections in a single scene. While presenting the Arab story of Layla and Majnun — in which the poet Majnun, while completely enamored with Layla, refuses to add a physical dimension to their relationship — Ahmed claims that it’s because to do so would be to ruin her divinity and thus go against his all-consuming love for her, no doubt a reflection of his own views, distilled into one single explanation. When his professor reminds him that his interpretation is more old-fashioned and only one of hundreds, she sets Ahmed on a path to re-evaluate his entire worldview. Immediately, we see his devotion to the madonna-whore complex crumble in a telling moment of growth.
Similarly compelling is Bouzid’s treatment of the cultural and situational factors that play into Farah and Ahmed’s relationship. Ahmed, as the son of immigrants who maintains strong ties to some of his culture but not others — for example, he subscribes to culturally-relevant patriarchal standards of purity, but can’t speak or read Arabic — is often depicted as torn between the two worlds. Unlike Farah, who is secure in her identity as an Arab person, he is at first bound tightly to beliefs that even his own family members don’t hold. Instead, he is often found at odd ideological ends when it comes to his relationship with Farah as he pursues what he thinks is the “perfect Arab life.”
The whole film, really, is about sex and what it means for love, connection, and intimacy. Through the re-examining of his relatonship with sex through various moments of awakening, Ahmed not only imporoves his relationshp with himself but also his culture, family, friends, and, of course, Farah. And to add to its many narrative and thematic successes, the film is also visually and emotionally stunning — the sex scenes, for one, are exemplary of how cinematographer Sébastien Goepfert’s skill in capturing a fleeting sense of intimacy — coming together to add depth to a story that is itself irresistible.
“Une Histoire” not only excels at what it sets out to do, but also leaves its audience rapt and aching for more. As Bouzid said of her hopes for the film at the beginning of the premiere, “I hope you’ll want to love, and to wish to do something else than love. To touch, too.”

There are some emotions the brain will not let in. They can overwhelm the nervous system and threaten the fundamental sense of who we are. The brain will shift and contort to avoid them, but we emerge from these experiences isolated — from the outside world, and from ourselves.
Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s “Drive My Car” is an intimate exploration of that unreachable kind of emotion. It traces traumatic grief through generations and cultures, following the story of actor and director Hidetoshi Nishijima (Yusuke Kafuku) as he stages a multi-lingual adaption of the famous Russian play “Uncle Vanya.” “Uncle Vanya” is the story of an old man consumed with regret over lost love and a wasted life. Re-enacted by a cast who cannot understand each other and speak a range of Chinese, Japanese, English, and Korean sign language, the play-within-a-film provides well-timed insights into the depth of regret in Hamaguchi’s film, while also foreshadowing the healing and catharsis to come.
The entire cast of "Drive My Car" breathes subtle, multi-layered range into their characters, with often-quiet, occasionally thunderous performances. Kafuku brings precision and carefulness to Hidetoshi — an actor in ruthless control over each feeling he allows the audience to glimpse. Subtle glances, sarcasm, and a tight-lipped delivery of layered metaphors all hint at the love and ugliness hidden beneath the character that’s slowly unraveling his sense of self.
Koji Takatsuki is also fantastic as Misaki, the youthful, unbridled foil to Hidetoshi’s stoicism. He is wide-eyed in contrast to Kafuku’s restraint, and Takatsuki expertly captures the slight exaggerations in most of Misaki’s pronouncements on his supposed inhibition and wild abandon. But in a scene where the movie’s many plot threads come together, he also gives the young womanizer a serious side that’s compelling and deeply believable.
In a mirror of Kafuku’s performance as Nishijima, Hamaguchi also keeps a tight grip on the film’s emotions, only allowing viewers rare glimpses through perfect music selections or subtle framing choices layered with meaning. We often see characters through a barrier: Nishijima catches his wife through a doorway, he is trapped in a blaring elevator, two lit cigarettes are framed through the top of a car door. These well-composed shots force the audience to see the characters exactly how Hamaguchi does — impossibly separated, isolated in their emotional world, connected across differences by a shared vice. Hamaguchi pulls his characters into their own worlds so he can throw them back into each other, demonstrating that they are not so different after all. Aided by these thoughtful technical choices, he achieves a rare sweet spot: The significance of his frequent metaphors and foreshadowing is clear and deeply felt, but also subtle, artful, and never heavy-handed.
Perhaps the greatest strength of “Drive My Car,” however, is the payoff of all of this symbolism and intricacy. Two of the film’s quietest characters visit a grave and one tells the other: “If I was your father, I would put my arms around you and tell you it wasn’t your fault. But that’s not true.” After hours of mystery and silence, the truth is finally faced — and it is a scene you will not soon forget.
In another unforgettable moment, a mute character gives perhaps the world’s greatest performance of the final lines of “Uncle Vanya” in Korean Sign Language — in a silent, elegiac tribute to living after the unimaginable.
In “Drive My Car,” Hamaguchi guides viewers into the depths of grief and guilt with the careful understanding of someone who has been down those same roads — and, perhaps, has truly found a way out. “Drive My Car” is a rare invitation: not only to look deeper into the human soul than most filmmakers have dared, but to emerge with a new understanding of yourself.

“Stillwater,” the latest film by writer and director Tom McCarthy, premiered on July 8 at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. Loosely based on the 2007 incarceration of the American Amanda Knox by an Italian court, the film follows Bill Baker (Matt Damon), an oil rig worker from Stillwater, Oklahoma whose estranged daughter, Allison (Abigail Breslin) is imprisoned for the murder of her ex-girlfriend and roommate in the French coastal city of Marseille. On a routine trip to visit his daughter for a few weeks, Bill meets Virginie (Camille Cottin) and her daughter Maya (Lilou Siauvaud), who decide to help Bill improve his life after Allison reveals that there is new evidence which could possibly exonerate her.
What ensues feels like it should have been two different films. While Virginie and Maya help Bill track down the person who could be the key to releasing Allison from prison, they share plenty of tender moments. Charming, heartfelt exchanges between Bill and Maya, who is helping the American learn French during their daily hangouts, and between Bill and Virginie, who is acting as both translator and detective in the hunt for new evidence, redeem the movie somewhat. The chemistry between Maya and Bill is especially endearing to watch.
The problem with the film is that it is not only about Maya, Bill, and Virginie — nor is it only about Bill’s desire to “do better” with this surrogate family than he did with his family back in Oklahoma. Ultimately, the storyline about Allison’s purportedly unjust sentence is what drives the film, creating an uncomfortable and, at times, awkward clash in its attempts to balance the genres of legal thriller and romantic dramedy. The result is a jumbled narrative which gives the impression that even McCarthy was unsure of exactly what he was going for.
Throughout the film, Bill’s ignorance of French culture and rash, violent decision-making skills can easily be seen as an example of how the rest of the world sees the U.S. working class. (The film itself is a collaboration between American and French filmmakers, after all.) But therein lies the problem. That Damon is wearing the right type of denim or sporting the most authentic goatee does not make his character any more valuable or even believable as the representative of the U.S. working class the film touts him to be.
While McCarthy and other screenwriters Noé Debré, Marcus Hinchey, and Thomas Bidegain had the opportunity to create a more nuanced and genuine depiction of the community that Damon calls “roughnecks” — one that isn’t rooted in inherently classist assumptions — they choose to base the entirety of their protagonist’s persona on the flimsy stereotypes that color the world’s depiction of the rural U.S., or “middle America.” Whereas a well-executed representation should have complicated what it means to be a working class person from the U.S. Midwest, there’s nothing about Bill’s character that departs from tired stereotypes of what Oklahomans are like. The result is a character whose depiction feels lazy and generally unearned.
It’s not just the fact that Damon’s Bill Baker is a Trump supporter, works in an oil rig, speaks in a thick midwestern accent, and owns multiple guns — though those are certainly stereotypes themselves — but also that he is a character whose own racial prejudices are not only left largely unchecked, but guide much of the film. From the outset, “Stillwater” expects its audience to quickly get on board with problematic depictions of communities of color and other marginalized groups. For example, apparent liberal Virginie — who represents one of the film’s weak attempts at making a statement about social justice and racism — wastes no time in telling Bill to stay out of the immigrant, low-income neighborhoods because she thinks they’re dangerous. When Bill refuses to listen, Virginie’s superstitions are proved correct.
At another point in the film, Bill and the folks helping him with Allison’s case insinuate that she — rather than an immigrant suspect — was jailed for killing her French Arab roommate precisely because of her whiteness and privilege. And if that’s not enough blunt stereotyping for a film released in 2021, add in that the other French Arab characters that are shown on screen are largely depicted as members of gangs or otherwise dangerous people to be around.
Even when openly and aggressively racist characters are introduced, “Stillwater” hardly attempts to mediate or push back on their views in a responsible way. The closest the film gets to pushing back against racism is when Virginie simply walks out on a conversation with a racist bar owner. Bill isn’t upset, and he claims that that’s just the way people are.
“Stillwater” is not itself a totally irredeemable film. Like most films which feature legal drama, unexpected romance, and stress-inducing action scenes (this hodge podge of a film includes all three), “Stillwater” is truly entertaining. Or rather, it can be, if one is only able to ignore both the blatantly racialized and classist stereotypes it hinges most of its unnecessarily messy plot on. By the end, few of the film’s many plot holes are explained, and the message is an unsatisfyingly contradictory one. Despite its attempts at engaging with complex concepts of racism in Europe and America, classism, family, and acceptance, the film essentially leaves its characters where they started. The Americans Bill and Allison, specifically, come out largely unscathed from the wild series of events that occupy the latter half of the movie, despite the extreme disruption it wreaks on the French family that was so dependably hosting them — a conclusion which the film ultimately argues is okay.
