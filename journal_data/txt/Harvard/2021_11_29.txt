After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This holiday season, in trying to find gifts for my friends and family, I’m struggling profoundly. And this is even within our post-modern, consumerist landscape of the 21st century, where so many of the advertisements I see are for ethically produced goods. I should be happy, right? I can admit this is a major shift from even just a few years ago and one that marks the larger societal recognition of the need to think more about what we’re buying and where it’s coming from. However, I still can’t shake the feeling that we’re not being sold the full story — or, maybe, we’re not understanding the more important point.
Thanks to our generation’s prioritization of ethical consumption, it’s now becoming the norm that major companies are promising sustainable sourcing of resources, fair-trade standards for their factory workers, and infamous “buy-one-give-one” slogans in which our purchase is matched with a donation of equal value. Initially, I was thrilled to hear about all of this.
I mean, my favorite companies were so committed to campaigns ranging from social justice to environmental stewardship that I was excited to shop again amidst the growing conversations about carbon footprints, toxic consumer culture, and overseas factory labor abuse. For a while there it even increased my spending. I mean, why not tack on an extra hoodie if it means that I’m supporting inner-city youth? Or, why not snatch just one more pair of shoes if, by doing so, a low-income child gets a pair, too?
That kind of thinking got dangerous, though. It soon occurred to me that a lot of these major corporations promising big donations with our increased spending get tax breaks for such self-proclaimed noble gifts. So, while their contributions are legitimate (and I’m not looking to take away from that), there are alternative motives driving what might be quickly turning into surface-level philanthropy by major companies. As usual, it seems greed is behind something even as seemingly good-natured as some of the increased social awareness of the companies we’ve been buying from. And, more annoyingly, it really works in getting our generation to keep the gears of capitalism turning.
At the core of many of these altruistic advertisements is the same motive that has always been there: the desire to convince more buyers to buy more products so that the company can make more money, regardless of impact. So, while it’s encouraging to see big corporations setting new standards for everything from carbon reduction to reductions in packaging, I still can’t seem to find peace in my holiday gift shopping this year.
It makes me think that the solution to our shared dilemma surrounding the impact of creating all of this “stuff” is to just stop buying it. Tied up in so many parts of our daily lives are the horrific impacts of everything from fast fashion to factory farming that we never thought twice about until the past few years. However, even as I seek to turn away from my traditional conception of gift giving, I struggle to find a satisfactory way to do so.
Even in attempts to gift meals instead of tangible items, there are caveats. Trips to the grocery store have become irritating. Walking through the aisles of the frozen food section makes me feel like somebody hired Willy Wonka to do the advertising for Tyson and Perdue and I question whether I really want to give someone a meal cooked with the gross byproduct of factory farming.
It’s not enough to only see things for what they are just in the moment they become relevant to us. Everything from the food we eat, to the clothes we wear, to the packaging that it’s all wrapped in has a history. In doing our holiday shopping this year, it’s important that we question not only what we’re giving and where it’s coming from, but if it's necessary to bring new “stuff” into being at all.
Going into the Christmas season, I’m trying to have the mindset that a gift doesn’t need to be a consumer good. And while I don’t have much of a solution quite yet for how to reframe gift giving, I do have a few goals for myself as I shop this year.
When I do shop, I want to keep it local. What I do buy, I want it to be artisanal and hand-made, unique in how it was crafted so it can be unique to the person I give it to. And, in most cases, I’m beginning to see how much further a small gift, something as simple as a handwritten note and a used book or small piece of art, can go in sharing love with friends and family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over a week ago, numerous members of our editorial board joined the broader Harvard community on a trip to the isolated enclave of New Haven, Conn., home to our supposed rival (and favorite safety school) Yale. To be more specific, we finagled the 130-mile trip by bus, train, or rented car to watch the Bulldogs lose 34-31 in the last seconds of an almost four-hour-long game. The Yale Bowl may have had awful reception, but the Harvard football team sent a crystal clear message — go Crimson! And, as always, thank you Yale for setting up a perfect Harvard win.
Beyond petty rivalries, we are thankful for the almost surreal joy of the weekend itself. As a board, we have repeatedly grieved that and those we lost to Covid-19, from the tangible things like time on a physical campus, to the abstract friendships and goodbyes. The Harvard-Yale weekend, however, offered some much-needed respite. Arguably everyone who attended — yes, even those donning those weird blue sweaters — won that day. From the forgotten joys of sharing a physical space, to bonding with complete strangers over witty chants, the game helped make our weird, Covid-defined collection of class years feel like a unified community again.
We are almost embarrassed to admit how much we needed a spirit-lifting, Harvard-beats-Yale weekend after the abundant personal and public misery that has characterized the past year and a half. But we did, and badly.
New Haven, of all places, made Harvard feel like home. For the very first time since March 10, 2020, we lived through an event that seemed almost untainted by the pandemic, despite the restrictions enforced by both universities; being inside a stadium with tens of thousands of people certainly helped. The casual, serendipitous run-ins with friendly faces reminded us of what we sorely ached for while at home, of the value of feeling known and seen and loved in a shared space.
Yet the Game also felt, in some ways, radically different than before. From the crowded tailgates to the field-storming, socialization at the game was broader and more inclusive in character — a trend that we hope remains a staple of future campus social life. For our peers who never before experienced a full-density campus and those who were evicted from it on March 10 alike, the game was profoundly reassuring, proof that not all fun times died with the turn of the decade. The synchronous, cautious suggestion from University Provost Alan M. Garber ‘76 that pandemic-related restrictions might ease next term only adds to our general feeling of triumphant return.
That’s not to say the pandemic is over or that we expect a complete return to normal — recent developments highlight just how unlikely that is in the immediate short term. But it does mean that we feel, for the first time, vindicated in our optimism, certain about our ability to find some light while trudging through the tunnel. For that alone, we are grateful — particularly to the wonderful, impressively talented athletes who dragged us all to enemy territory and boosted our school spirit with their win.
Harvesting that optimism — directing the positive buzz of our newly strengthened appreciation for each other's company — will be crucial in the spring. We have now seen what Harvard can look like at its best: inclusive, comfortable, fun. Simply put, our togetherness is uniquely powerful. There’s no reason to confine it to the time we spend away from campus, in some godforsaken Connecticut hamlet. The pandemic break in social life gives us a chance to rebuild and reimagine our spaces, to create a social scene that we care for, that serves all of us better.
At the Bowl, Harvard overcame Yale at the very last minute. In doing so it made us feel, in a cheesy, symbolic way, like we were overcoming the past year, too. Though we were not sure what the outcome of the game would be when it first started, and though things looked bad until the very last minute, our peers pulled through for a victory. We too are hoping to ultimately pull through after the uncertainty of that first March; to accept, adjust, and welcome a new post-pandemic (or, at the very least, post-initial-pandemic-trauma) era. Rushing the field to mark our victory was a run towards celebrating all the hard-fought victories, all we have weathered together since we first heard someone utter the term ‘Covid-19’.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money — at least if you avoid making unfortunate comparisons with weightier sums like the Harvard endowment or El Jefe’s presumable nightly sales revenue. At the start of each school year, Harvard adds a $200 student activities fee to our tuition. This money is collected by the administration, and $500,000 of it is given to the Undergraduate Council to be spent on behalf of the student body. Whether or not you agree with the quantity that is asked or even the fundamental logic behind it, it is hard not to get excited about the possibilities so much money represents.
Fundamentally, the Undergraduate Council is elected by the student body to spend our money to improve campus life and effectively advocate for our interests with Harvard administrators. These are not easy tasks, but they are relatively straightforward directives compared to the kinds of challenges facing real governments and other organizations tackling larger social issues.
When my friend Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and I decided to run for UC President and Vice President, we did it out of a sense that our student government has been diluted by unnecessary bureaucracy and politics. As a UC outsider, I was shocked when Mike slammed his personal copy of the UC’s 21,612-word Constitution on my desk during a conversation about his frustration with the organization. My surprise was two-fold: First, I had no idea why Mike would carry something like that around with him, nor from where he had produced the enormous document. Second, I couldn’t imagine why an organization responsible for improving student life and advocating for our interests with Harvard’s administration would need a document the length of a minor novel to regulate its actions.
At my first UC meeting, I was blown away by the amount of time and energy lost negotiating red tape and complex political relationships. Three hours were spent wading through an agenda that had been projected to take one hour, and by the end a member was in tears following an intense debate on complicated constitutional changes. I left the meeting upset, saddened to see people who are hardworking and passionate about making Harvard better being held back by a broken system. I was angry at what I saw as distractions from the basic tasks of student government and frustrated by the allegations of UC financial mismanagement.
Faced with structural inadequacies such as those that plague the UC, dramatic reform seems the only viable option. When Mike and I campaigned under the (admittedly provocative) slogan “Defund the UC,” we weren’t advocating for the end of student activity funding or the end of student government. Rather, we were calling for the establishment of a new student government that more effectively advocates for students, free of the UC’s bureaucratic inefficiencies.
After being inaugurated on Dec. 5, our first task is organizing a constitutional convention composed of Harvard students who want to build a student government that works. The convention’s goal is to write a constitution for a new student government to replace the UC. While Mike and I will participate in the Convention as facilitators, decisions will be left to the will of students at the Convention and the final Constitution will be sent to the student body for ratification by referendum. If our vision for the new government is not seen out through the Convention, so be it; our highest priority is giving Harvard a student government that is more legitimate and effective, and that only happens if students decide what their student government looks like.
A new student government would help address the inefficiencies of the current UC, but we must also allocate energy and resources to better serve Harvard students’ needs. With the money saved by financial reform, we hope to improve campus social life by establishing a Party Committee. The committee would provide resources for students to host social gatherings, making Harvard’s social scene more open. It will partner with House Committees and student groups to throw larger themed events, leveraging the student activities fee into events that are enjoyed by all.
Furthermore, Mike and I will lead advocacy campaigns to save Shopping Week and use civic tech tools, such as Pol.is, to improve our student government’s responsiveness. We will appoint a cabinet of people to work on concrete improvements to campus life — such as improving shuttle wait times and reliability, increasing institutional support for first-generation, low-income students, and bringing tomato basil raviolini soup back to our dining halls.
We deserve a student government that effectively serves us and delivers on the resources we contribute to it. We deserve a social scene that everyone can find a space in, a say in how our money gets spent, and to be well-represented with Harvard’s administration. Given the UC’s failure to meet these standards, I say it’s high time we engage in a proud Boston tradition: revolution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike most students who submit their college applications after four years of high school, Ashley N. Emann ’23 applied to Harvard after serving four years in the United States Marine Corps.
Emann said she found herself calling the admissions office every week with questions about the application process.
“When I was applying, I was constantly calling in the office,” she said. Even that caused her to wonder, “'Am I making the right decision admitting that I don’t know what I’m doing?’”
“You’re like, ‘I’m applying to an Ivy League, I’m sure all these high school students know what the heck they’re doing. I don’t know what I’m doing,’” Emann added. Though she decided that she “might as well ask,” there are “other veterans who don’t know how to ask for help.”
In her role as a student coordinator on the Harvard Admissions Office’s Undergraduate Admissions Council, Emann is working to help answer those questions for veterans applying to the College. She and her co-coordinator, Hudson T. Miller ’23, hold talks for prospective veteran applicants covering topics including housing, financial aid, and transfer credit.
Miller, who also served in the Marine Corps, said he and Emann are working to make the Undergraduate Admissions Council a more effective resource for veterans applying to the College.
“For the most part, the majority of vets are low-income, they’re first-gen often, so those are hard demographics to reach just in general — let alone when you’ve taken four to 12 years of a break from college since high school,” Miller said. “The position with the UAC is perfectly set up to allow us to cater the message from administration to these guys and girls who are interested in applying.”
Miller said veterans can experience increased pressure and self-doubt when applying to college.
“A lot of vets are too scared, or scared out of going to college, because they need to provide for their family, they need to do all these things,” Miller said. “They need protection, because the military provides so much support, and often that support — though helpful — can become a crutch.”
Emann said increased support was crucial in her experience applying to college as a veteran. She spent a year preparing to apply to college and took military-sponsored courses designed to help service members plan their lives after their time in the military.
“I was very lucky and I was very adamant about getting that year,” she said. “You have others who are in shops that don’t allow that, they give you a month to check out, get all your stuff together and be ready to go wherever you need to go when you leave.”
Marcus E. Shoberg ’25, who served in the U.S. Army for eight years before arriving at Harvard, said he relied on third-party services, like Service to School, to help him apply. He said having a veteran-specific student coordinator on the UAC when he applied would have made the application process clearer.
“I don’t think veterans need — or want — handouts, or to be coddled, or to be catered towards, during the application process,” Shoberg said. “But I think more than anything, just having the point of contact and the ability to clarify during the application process is probably going to be huge for veterans in the next application cycle.”
Miller said he is pleased with this new role on the UAC.
“We’re in the room now,” he said. “I think that’s a very important thing, and a lot of people want that.”

Researchers in Harvard’s Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department discovered that after they manipulated the cells of worms, the worms passed on those genomic changes to their offspring, a finding that may offer other insights into cellular regeneration.
Professor Mansi Srivastava, who has been analyzing three-banded panther worms for over a decade, led the study — published in Developmental Cell last month — alongside postdoctoral researcher Lorenzo Ricci.
The researchers performed the process of transgenesis, in which scientists insert foreign material into the genome of an organism to observe how its cells respond, on the three-banded panther worms, a species of acoel worm.
The acoel worm is particularly representative of a “major yet understudied animal lineage” and its genome was recently sequenced, according to the study.
“Development of more genetic tools in acoels has the potential to advance the study of an important yet understudied animal group as well as to inform the evolution of pathways for development, regeneration, and stem cell biology,” the study reads.
Srivastava developed a transgenesis process that creates a glow-in-the-dark gene, giving the worms a fluorescent glow, according to the study. She created a process of microinjection of DNA into gut or skin cells, which progresses to create red or green colored proteins.
The worms kept in the lab surprisingly started reproducing, allowing the researchers to delve deeper into how genomic manipulation can transfer through generations, according to Srivastava. The worms also created embryos, which allowed for the creation of transgenic lines, an especially powerful tool in studying any biological phenomenon, she explained.
“What we did was one thing that’s one step further [than previous research],” Srivastava said. “We made a stable transgenic line — not only is the thing that we injected the information into glowing, its babies are also going to be glowing.”
“[This] means that the manipulation of the genome was not just incorporated into all of the adult cells — it also gets incorporated into the germline, the cells that will make the next generation the egg and the sperm,” she added.
Understanding regeneration in the transgenic worms could provide important insights into the regenerative process for humans, according to Srivastava. Further study on species that are more closely related to humans could help advance regenerative medicine, she added.
“We’re over time going to gather enough information to have a good understanding of what has changed along the line of human evolution that prevents regeneration from happening, and thereby use that information to solve those problems as well,” Srivastava said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s committees on shareholder responsibility — composed of an advisory committee and a sub-group of the Harvard Corporation that advise the University on matters related to social responsibility in its investment decisions — voted on three resolutions presented to Facebook shareholders during the last fiscal year, according to a report published earlier this month.
The Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility is comprised of 12 University affiliates who advise the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, which consists of members of the Harvard Corporation — the University's highest governing body — who have voting power.
The report, which spanned the past two academic years, included nine new guidelines for the Harvard Management Company’s external investment managers. It also summarized the votes on the three resolutions presented to the shareholders of Facebook, the tech giant that was renamed Meta in October.
The Corporation Committee voted in support of two shareholder resolutions that would ask Facebook to detail the extent to which it addresses issues of child exploitation and “disinformation.”
The first resolution requested that Facebook combat the sexual exploitation of children with new privacy tools, such as end-to-end encryption to protect underage users.
CCSR members voted in favor of the proposal following the recommendation of the ACSR. Members of the advisory group noted the “seriousness of online child sexual exploitation” and Facebook’s influence in the matter, according to the report.
“Members also expressed the view that Facebook has a responsibility to understand and communicate to shareholders the potential implications of a broad shift to end-to-end encryption, especially as it relates to the company’s ability to continue detecting and addressing exploitative content and behavior,” the report continues.
The second resolution approved by the CCSR asked Facebook to study the benefits and harms to the company and its employees of the platform’s actions instituted during the 2020 election cycle to “limit the spread of disinformation and ‘divisive information.’”
The committee voted in favor of the proposal, in line with the unanimous recommendation of the ACSR, citing the University’s past support of similar measures requesting Facebook to publish reports evaluating policies on content governance and assessing risks of such strategies.
The CCSR abstained, however, on another resolution calling for the nomination of a human and civil rights expert to Facebook’s Board of Directors. The ACSR recommended a vote against the resolution, noting that the company already hired two senior managers with civil and human rights experience.
The report also mentioned that some members wondered how Facebook could determine whether an individual qualifies as an expert and suggested that the scope of expertise was “ill-defined.”
Committee members also worried that adding a rights expert to the board could absolve the rest of Facebook’s corporate management from the responsibility of engaging with issues related to human and civil rights, according to the report.
In recent years, the Harvard Management Company has relied on investments managed by outside firms to gain better exposure to public equity markets. In response to the move, both committees have shifted their focus on developing guidelines that can help Harvard's external investment managers.
In 2019-20, the Corporation Committee voted on two resolutions presented to companies in which the University held shares — PepsiCo, Facebook, and Alphabet are named in the report — and abstained on all other measures.
The report claimed that the ACSR did not have time to review the social responsibility consequences of these resolutions, citing the “extraordinary circumstances” of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Following long-standing practice with proxies not considered by the ACSR, the CCSR voted on two such proposals in 2020 for which prior ACSR recommendations and CCSR votes provided controlling precedent,” the report reads.
In 2020, the ACSR resumed deliberations and created nine new voting guidelines related to Environmental, Social, And Governance, Board Diversity, Deforestation Risk, Human Rights Policy, Diversity, and Water Contamination Risk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team rode a five-game winning streak to Princeton, N.J., for the Northeast Water Polo Conference playoffs on Nov. 19-21. The No. 2 Crimson (26-6, 9-2 NWPC) entered the playoffs poised to make a run at defending its 2019 crown after it was stripped of that opportunity by the pandemic last fall.
Harvard began its postseason run with a 21-10 quarterfinal thrashing of No. 7 Connecticut College (1-16). However, that would be as far as the team would go, as its title hopes sank with an 11-10 defeat to No. 3 St. Francis College (16-7, 6-3). The Crimson still had the chance to salvage third place but fell 15-13 to No. 4 Brown (20-14, 5-4).
“It was a great season, and I am proud of my team and what we accomplished,” wrote Harvard head coach Ted Minnis in an email. “We did not achieve our ultimate goal, but we were able to compete this season, which is what we all wanted to do after this past year.”
HARVARD 21, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 10
Harvard’s quarterfinal matchup against Connecticut College marked the second contest of the season between the two teams. Led by freshman forward Andrej Basica’s early hat trick, the Crimson jumped to a 12-6 commanding lead after the first half and never looked back.
The Camels scored two points to open the second half before the Crimson began a 9-0 run to balloon its lead to 21-8. Basica and fellow first-year forward Alex James each netted four goals while junior goalie Nathan Wu contributed 14 saves. Harvard extended its win streak to six games with the victory.
“I think our energy was really high and everyone was clicking in the first game,” junior co-captain Alex Tsotadze said. “Unfortunately, we weren't able to carry that momentum through the weekend.”
ST. FRANCIS 11, HARVARD 10
Harvard’s momentum flamed out in its semifinal matchup against St. Francis. The game was even late in regulation until St. Francis sophomore defender Adonis Vlassis netted the game-winning goal with 42 seconds left to crush Harvard’s hopes of repeating.
The match was the third and most important installment of the season series between the two teams. Each team held a win over the other with Harvard earning the most recent win in the series, a 20-5 rout on Oct. 30.
The Terriers were on fire early, notching the first three goals of the game. After a quick timeout, Minnis rallied the Crimson, as first-year forward Tyler Zarcu scored the first goal for Harvard, beginning its own 3-0 run to claw back into the game. The Terriers scored the last goal of the first quarter with one second left to go up 4-3.
“Those first three goals weren’t the best of goals to give up,” junior co-captain Noah Hodge said. “After that timeout, we just took the time to take a deep breath and regroup and kind of recenter ourselves.”
The second quarter saw the same amount of scoring, giving the Terriers an 8-6 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, a defensive battle ensued, as the teams were held scoreless for nearly six minutes. Harvard sophomore center Mot Stothart broke the tension by netting a goal — only for the Terriers to quickly respond. Each team added another goal to get the score to 10-8 entering the final stanza.
Sophomore forward Owen Hale opened the scoring in the final period to cut the Terriers’ lead to one goal. After five minutes of scoreless action, sophomore forward Alexandru Bucur notched the equalizer with 1:58 remaining. Momentum was on Harvard’s side as an overtime period loomed, but the Crimson gave up the game-winning goal with 42 seconds left. Harvard’s ensuing offensive possession stalled as St. Francis became the only team to defeat the Crimson twice this season.
BROWN 15, HARVARD 13
After its disappointing loss, Harvard faced a familiar foe — Brown — with the chance to earn a third-place finish. Harvard swept the regular season series against the Bears.
But the playoff matchup turned out to be a different story. Once again, Harvard was caught in a late stalemate against its playoff opponent. Harvard crumbled once more, as Brown’s junior forward Cole Atwell scored the game-winner with 27 seconds left to deliver a second straight heartbreaking playoff loss for the Crimson.
Harvard’s Basica opened the scoring by tallying the first two points of the game. Brown responded and led 8-6 entering the second half. Harvard scored five goals in the third quarter and Hodge added in a clutch penalty save to give the Crimson an 11-10 lead at the end of the third quarter.
Brown took a 13-12 lead halfway through the fourth quarter until Tsotadze scored the equalizer late. Another potential overtime loomed, but a critical expulsion of Harvard junior center defender Gabe Putnam gave the Bears a power play. Brown took full advantage and regained the lead with 27 seconds left. Once again, Harvard came away empty-handed in its final offensive possession, and then Brown added an insurance goal to win 15-13.
“It is definitely harder to play against a team that is really familiar with you,” Tsotadze said. “When you play water polo at the collegiate level, and especially in the playoffs, it all comes down to game-to-game adjustments. Both St. Francis and Brown were able to implement and execute at a high level.”
Even after the disappointing end to the season, team morale has remained high.
“In no way is it a failure of a season because we got fourth place in [the] playoffs,” Hodge said. “There are a ton of positives that came out of this season, and it just makes me excited for the next [season].”
Some of those positives included Tsotadze earning the NWPC Most Valuable Player Award and a spot on the all-conference first team. Hodge also earned a spot on the team — his third consecutive bid — along with Putnam.
The Crimson will look to reclaim its title next fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s squash team has started the season strong with consecutive 9-0 wins — over No. 10 Rochester (1-1), Brown, and MIT (3-2).
“The culture on the team is as good as it has ever been … with brilliant captains and leadership,” Harvard head coach Mike Way said. “I think we’re in contention for a title, but because there’s been two seasons since [competitive play], we’re not sure what our opposition looks like, so it’s going to be exciting from that perspective.”
Almost two years away from the competitive squash arena left the Crimson hungry to return to the court. In the time off, players worked to stay in shape and prepare for a hopeful return, but for many, finding access to courts and opponents was a difficult task. Not all players were able to find courts or open gyms during the pandemic, and for those with access, many were only allowed to hit solo.
“Overall, I think the guys have come back in pretty good shape,” Harvard senior captain Sam Scherl said. “The various Covid restrictions had a large effect on how much people were able to train, but I think overall, the guys really did the best they could in the circumstances and showed up ready to perform to the best of their ability this season.”
Scherl and co-captain Marwan Tarek were instrumental in keeping the team organized and motivated during the time off. Way lamented that team Zoom meetings became more of a chore than a benefit and that, due to the cancelled season, many players felt they were training in a vacuum. He said the captains were able to step up and help the squad remain focused and engaged.
That focus paid off immediately in Harvard’s pre-season games, when the Crimson narrowly beat out the University of Pennsylvania, 5-4, in an Ivy League scrimmage. The Ivy schools are traditionally the Crimson’s most challenging opponents, so the victory in the Ivy Scrimmages bodes well for January, when it will face conference opponents again in an official setting.
Harvard’s early success carried into its first matches, where it swept all three opponents. The first match of the season against Rochester saw the Crimson lose just one of the 28 games played by its nine starters. Freshmen Neel Joshi and Tate Harms began their Harvard squash careers with 3-0 victories over their opponents.
The Crimson experienced similar success in consecutive 9-0 matches over Brown and MIT. Harvard won all 27 games against Brown, with two more first-years — Erik Wang and John Ho — making their collegiate debuts with respective 3-0 wins over opponents from the Bears. Freshman Connor Stoltz made his debut the following day with a 3-1 win against his opponent from MIT, against which Harvard won 27 of the 29 games played.
The decisive 9-0 wins have been a confidence boost as the Crimson prepares itself for more difficult opponents.
“The team has performed well so far, and the real test of our season is going to be in January,” Scherl said. “I think these matches have been really helpful to get a sense of where everyone’s playing, where to improve, and kind of gearing up for when […] we’ll really be tested against the other top teams.”
The team has two more trials before the meat of its season in January, following the winter break. Harvard will face off against Tufts on Tuesday before playing Dartmouth on Wednesday. Way said the Crimson approaches every opponent with equal respect and effort and will be focusing especially on No. 11 Dartmouth, which has not yet played its first game.
“Dartmouth is a team where, on paper, we are the favorite, but we always have tough matches against [them],” Way said. “With Dartmouth, we have to prepare as if we are playing one of our top competitors. The match [this] Wednesday is a check-in – are we on track?”
Historically, Harvard has been one of the strongest men’s collegiate squash teams in the country. It secured undefeated seasons during its national championship runs in 2020 and 2019. The pandemic put a pause on its success, but the squad has picked up where it left off thus far in the 2021-22 season. The Crimson hopes to maintain its winning streak as it faces Tufts and Dartmouth this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard first-year Sophia Montgomery’s strong performance at the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association Women's Singlehanded Nationals on Nov. 6-7 rounded out a strong season for the Harvard sailing team this fall. Montgomery finished in fourth place in a field of 18 sailors who raced on the Chesapeake Bay in Annapolis, Md., placing ahead of all other freshmen who were racing.
Montgomery’s showing at the ICSA Nationals came after the sailing team finished in the top five in five of its final six races of the season. Montgomery said she stayed after practice to do additional training in order to get prepared for singlehanded nationals.
“I prepared by doing extra sailing sessions with the coach at different venues around Boston like the harbor and the river,” Montgomery said.
Montgomery finished with 51 total points in the 14 races.
“Sophia in particular has been a really impressive addition to the team,” Harvard co-captain Emma Kaneti said. “It was awesome to watch her do so well in nationals, and she was the highest-performing freshman.”
“I am looking forward to seeing her come back next year and hopefully take the title,” Kaneti added.
Harvard posted a strong performance on Oct. 30 as well, with two top-five finishes and a twelfth-place finish. In the 2021 Victorian Urn Trophy, the Crimson placed fourth with a final score of 190 points. The team also placed fifth in the Schell Trophy with a total score of 254 points. To cap off the weekend, the Crimson finished in twelfth place at the Nickerson Trophy with a final score of 166 points.
“Everybody is working really hard right now just getting up the learning curve really quickly, so I’ve been really impressed with our entire class of walk-ons,” Kaneti said.
The Crimson also captured two first-place finishes, a third-place finish, and a seventh-place finish between Oct. 23-24.
“Senior experience and leadership showed this weekend, which led to our dominance at the regatta,” said Crimson senior co-captain Eric Hansen on Oct. 27
At the Norman G. Reid Trophy Team Race, which was held by Boston College on Oct. 23 on the Charles River, Harvard finished in first place, ahead of Brown and BC. Harvard also won the Lane Trophy Team Race, held at Tufts on Oct. 24. Harvard boats went 24-1 between the two regattas.
At the Yale Women’s Regatta, also held on Oct. 23, the Crimson finished third place with 132 points. Yale won its home race with 78 points, finishing ahead of Brown (128 points).
Compared to other races, Harvard struggled at the Co-ed Atlantic Coast Tournament on Oct. 23, finishing in seventh place. The Crimson had a final score of 139 points, leaving them 43 points behind first-place SUNY Maritime College.
“Sailing — it’s tricky because unlike other sports we have different competitions each weekend, and each of these competitions have different levels of competitiveness,” Hansen said. “We are used to sailing in the river which has flat water and more shifty conditions, whereas the ocean is more wavy and shifty,”
Despite this loss, Harvard overall had a strong performance last weekend, partly due to its practice methods, Hansen said.
“The coaches did a great job of teaching us how to make the boat maneuver smoothly, making sure that our tacks and jibes became second nature, especially given that we have many new people and keeping them up to speed,” Hansen said.
As the sailing team moves into the Spring sailing period, they are eager to prepare and become a better team.
“I look forward to learning how to team race and becoming more comfortable in double-handed boats for the Spring,” Montgomery said.

Expectations 
Harvard-Yale. The game of the year. A must-attend event. The ultimate showdown between age-old rivals. Or, at least that’s what I’ve heard the Office of Student Engagement continually sends me emails about. As a freshman, the pro-Harvard, #yuckfale mentality runs deep, and I simply can’t wait to experience my first heavily attended college football game.
First and foremost, I expect Harvard to win. That’s a given. I’ve already come up with five jokes shitting on Yale to tell to my Yalie friends, so it would be pretty embarrassing for me if we lost. I also hope that I see a heated argument between a Harvard and Yale student (bonus points if they are two guys with J names). I’m not sure how deep the Harvard/Yale rivalry actually is, but I personally wouldn’t trust any Yalie after the 2004 Harvard-Yale prank.
On the other hand, I’ve heard that Yale students are pretty attractive and have great style. Only since you definitely asked, I wouldn’t mind finding myself a Yale guy. We would have the best meet-cute and could live out an eternal Harvard-Yale rivalry that’s simultaneously very serious and very charming.
Unfortunately, the weather reports indicate we will be in jacket territory, but I’m excited to wear my Harvard merch on the one day when it’s socially acceptable to have school pride.
I’ve already started preparing myself for the ultimate rally from the party at Toads up until the 9 a.m. pregame. And while I have a couple lodging options, I think it could be fun to spice it up a bit and sleep in an unplanned location for a night. Why not?
While I’m confident there will be a substantial amount of chaos and disorganization, Harvard-Yale will be a great opportunity to bond with my Harvard friends <3 and kick some Bulldog butt.
Reality
The Yale Bowl has absolutely no service. Someone did warn me about this, but I didn’t fully believe them. While this did contribute to a 50 minute Uber wait, it also forced me to be very present during the nail-biting game. By the top of the fourth (is that baseball? That’s definitely baseball), my friends thought we had no chance. I told them not to lose hope because Tom Brady wins most of his games in the last quarter, and I think that obscure sports reference (that may or may not be actually correct) definitely garnered me some respect.
Winning was a great feeling. Although, I will admit the Yalies had better roasts (“Harvard is just one big red flag!” “They’re called majors, bro” “Harvard not good school”). Someone even yelled “You guys smelled bad.” And yes, that is what happens when a school forces its students to pay for laundry. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the energy of our student section; it was definitely all those “safety school” chants that brought us to victory.
There’s a lot to unpack regarding the Yale party scene. From athletic houses and frats to Toads and live music in random basements (don’t ask), Yale does hypothetically have more options for a fun night out. Compared to Harvard, though, the quality of these functions was lacking (in this writer’s humble opinion).
Picture the lax house, for instance: A thin layer of a mud-like substance covers the floor. You look around only to see everyone dancing the “shopping cart” or “imaginary DJ.” One guy is passionately singing, but it’s painfully clear that he doesn’t actually know the lyrics. The music stops and an ad plays; this, unfortunately, will happen several times throughout the night.
Even with these twilight zone parties, I had such an incredible experience and can’t wait for next year’s game. And, while I didn’t find the perfect Yale man, I did get a great selfie with a random football player!
