After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“The Walking Dead” returned this past Valentine’s Day with a mid-season premiere that leaped back into the siege of Alexandria, culminating in its liberation as well as the convergence of our favorite group of survivors. The episode held the hefty ambition of tying together every conflict and character arc left loose in the last half-season’s cliffhanger. The narrative continuously jumps between four to five perspectives in a matter of minutes, resulting in a busy, muddled, and whiplash-inducing experience. Yet with an estimated death toll of 800 zombies and four semi-important characters, the episode is a genuine blast to view, delivering gleefully wicked and sadistic deaths to rival those in “Game of Thrones.” “No Way Out” seems to have been a field day for the show’s writers, granting them a full hour to clumsily kill off any character they felt tired of writing about and to nix several character arcs out of necessity and/or fatigue.
The opening moments slingshot Daryl (Norman Reedus), Abraham (Michael Cudlitz), and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) into the hands of Negan’s goons, who force their way into an already busy episode. Even so, the sequence established Negan as a promising villain who could rival “The Governor” in his cruelty and psychopathy. The writers cleverly subverted the show’s tense Mexican standoff routine by replacing Daryl’s signature crossbow with a bazooka. Daryl and his deus-ex-bazooka later become an preposterously efficient device for disposing of Alexandria’s zombie infestation. Harnessing the powers of redneck science, Daryl sets fire to the town’s pond, which lures them all to a crispy death.
We then return to the very last moments of the episode’s cliffhanger, wherein Crazy Rick and company adopted a sheep-in-wolf’s clothing tactic from Season 1’s “Guts” episode. Traveling through a mob of zombies with only a layer of zombie guts for protection is hard enough without bringing obtuse characters along. Unfortunately, they bring Rick’s short-lived girlfriend, Jessie, and her son Sam, who are still not aware of zombies as a life-threatening presence. The result is a gloriously self-indulgent chain reaction of death reminiscent of SNL’s “Dear Sister.” Sam first goes into shock after realizing that zombies exist and starts to cry; he is, of course, subsequently torn to pieces, after which Jessie loses all sense of her surroundings and virtually throws herself into the hands of these flesh-eating creatures. The domino effect strikes Ron, who attempts to remedy the situation by pointing a gun at Rick. Thankfully, Michonne impales Ron with her katana—but Ron then shoots Carl in the eye. The surrounding zombies merely stand around as if this slaughter were all one bloody party foul. The comical, near-slapstick sequence reminds viewers that “The Walking Dead” is fundamentally aware that its best moments are sometimes its most unapologetically twisted and sickening.
Other survivors, such as ex-pacifists Gabriel and Eugene, undergo exercises in rediscovering their willpower. Through the magic of motivational speeches concerning loved ones and perseverance, all of Alexandria eventually join Crazy Rick in his zombie killing spree to avenge Carl’s right eye. The last act evokes the Greek carnage from Zack Snyder’s “300” and even features a fast-cutting close-up montage of our bloodied characters indulging in chops and stabs that stylistically inflect their triumph with a ironic, biting tinge of ruthlessness. The true tragedy of the once-pristine, isolated Alexandria is that its invasion by external forces and beliefs drove it to embrace bloodshed and violence. Even amidst the episode’s overwrought melodrama, plot absurdities, and unabashed ultraviolence, the writers preserve the show’s serious questions about corruption and morality in this “New World.”
“No Way Out” constantly shifts between dark soap opera and self-indulgent violence. Extraneous characters are killed for the sake of it, even though Alexandria seems to be stocked with an indiscriminate supply of miscellaneous town members, and conflict resolution is as nonsensical as an ’80s action movie. At this point, however, invested fans need not be reminded that “The Walking Dead” has always been as bad as it has been good. Here, the writers have somehow been able to turn the show’s conventionally weak qualities into a fun hour of entertainment that clears the way for Negan, who looks to be another villain born from tragedy.

Imagine yourself on the dance floor an hour before midnight, but you’re not dancing. Instead, you watch. The room is dark save for a spotlight projected on a man. Glow-in-the-dark dots on the gloves of the performers move around you like flickering neon lights. Suddenly, one of the glowing hands flashes in front of your face. You make eye contact with the dancer: a woman covered in black from feet to eye shadow who gives you a fierce stare before moving away.
This was one of the many mesmerizing moments at ToUch’s “AcousticaElectronica,” an immersive theatrical event that played at the OBERON on Feb. 12. Meshing classical and electronic music with dance and acrobatics, the show managed to subvert and transform perceptions of both beloved tropes and theater for an innovative experience.
“AcousticaElectronica” told its story using dance and music and no dialogue, except for a brief introduction of the characters at the beginning. This narrative decision, along with the show’s use of seemingly distinct vignettes to advance the plot, created a story that was ambiguous and often open to interpretation. The fragments of information that are available introduce the audience to Carmen (Sarah Naughton), who is a performer and the lover of the MC, Dorian Gray (Sebastiani Romanaglo). Her good friend, the Conductor (Travis Artz), is a struggling composer. When tensions increase between the Conductor and Dorian Gray, the characters’ lives soon spiral downhill toward a tragic conclusion.
While the use of familiar characters gave the show its foundations for subversion, the technical design elements, such as costumes, further emphasized the characters’ roles and the way they played on common tropes. For instance, Dorian Gray donned a simple black suit and a mask, both embellished with shards resembling mirrors. As the only adornments on his costume, the mirrored jewels suggested his obsession with appearances, a notable trait found in his eponym from Oscar Wilde’s novel. Meanwhile the mask recalled the crafty, domineering Phantom of the Opera—a role that Dorian also fulfilled throughout the show by manipulating characters from the background, including a number in which he puppeteered various dancers.
The show’s greatest element, however, lay in its impressive music and dancing. The accompanying music was an EDM remix of famous classical works that seamlessly blended the sound of orchestral instruments with electric guitar, synths, and harsh beats. “Habanera,” the famous aria in Georges Bizet’s “Carmen,” remained an operatic feat, sung flawlessly and in keeping with classical tradition by Naughton. Under the touch of “AcousticaElectronica,” however, it also gained a modern quality as the DJ (Danny Satori) spun a head-banging, toe-tapping rhythm to support her powerful and operatic gusto. The performers likewise successfully meshed ballet with contemporary and modern dance in all of their numbers—a subtle mix that asserted the innate similarities between the styles.
Furthermore, by experimenting with the boundaries of theater and performance art, “AcousticaElectronica” created a unique experience for the audience, both intimate and exciting. Performers executed graceful acrobatics on trapezes and ribbons in between the storytelling vignettes, recalling a disco-esque Cirque du Soleil. Meanwhile, the dance floor setting allowed for immersive, creative staging that employed every corner of the room, from the mezzanine to the actual stage itself. Such endeavors to transform storytelling were the greatest success of “AcousticaElectronica.”
In this way, among many others, “AcousticaElectronica” not only stunned with its visual effects and dance numbers but also managed to use these histrionics to develop a connecting thread that suggested the temporal universality of stories and themes. It was a romp for a weekend night—and a thoughtful one at that.
ToUch’s “AcousticaElectronica” will return to the OBERON on Mar. 25.

Uncertainty dominates our lives. From what the Catch of the Day will be (we may never truly know) to generally accepted interpretations of the mathematics describing the fundamental nature of matter, the world is rife with possibility. In some sense, it’s amazing that we aren’t paralyzed in our decision-making by the unknowability of the future—though you might have felt as much as you stared down your iPhone’s gray ellipses bubble, desperately hoping for a "yes" to some follow-up Netflix and Chill with your Valentine.
Indeed, love and uncertainty inevitably go hand in hand. And while we are comfortable using mathematics to quantify risk everywhere from the stock market to weather forecasts, it strikes most as an affront to even suggest that economics and statistics could say anything about the institution of love.
I’ll be the first to admit that these fields could never come close to reducing the human experience to a set of equations. In spite of their names, solutions to the stable marriage and secretary/marriage problems won’t and can’t reveal the secrets of affection; however, these and other ideas from financial theory can offer new perspectives, orthogonal to those of Márquez or The Bachelor, on navigating the travails of romance.
Take the idea of expectation. Intuitively, and with an apology to probability theorists, the expectation of an unknown outcome—think the roll of a die—is simply the outcome on average. More precisely, it is equal to the sum of every possible outcome multiplied by the probability that it occurs; hence, the expected number of dots thrown on a die is three and a half, since each side of the die has a one-in-six chance of being thrown.
Expectation plays a central role in finance because it is the foundation for valuing stocks, bonds, and financial derivatives. To a first order, a financial security is worth the expected cash flows it offers you: You should be willing to pay up to about fifty cents for a one-shot machine that prints out a dollar bill half the time and nothing the other half. You’d be giving away money on average if you paid any more.
In our everyday lives, expectation provides a baseline for luck. You might consider yourself lucky if you like big numbers and throw a four, five, or six on a given die roll, and unlucky if you throw below your expectation of three and a half. With this in mind, consider a game in which you have two chances to roll a die with the option of walking away after either throw. I will pay you, in dollars, the number of dots showing on the die you just rolled. What’s your strategy?
Since you know that a fresh die roll will pay out $3.50 on average, you would only want to roll again if you unluckily threw a one, two, or three at first; otherwise, you would forgo the second roll to lock in your above-average winnings. If you were given more chances to roll, you would be become weakly more willing to pass on any given number, and with infinitely many rolls, you would pass on every throw until you hit a six.
So what’s love got to do with it?
Imagine you knew that there were only two people left on Earth who would date you (perhaps a rosy view of reality for me), and suppose you found yourself slightly happier than expected upon dating the first of the two. Then, you probably wouldn’t want to take your chances with the second, since you would be less happy on average than you are now. Even if your current partner isn’t quite your soulmate, the fact that you did better than expected means you’ve, in some sense, won this dating game.
Like with dice, you can be more discerning if you know you’ll have more chances for love later on. We know this intuitively: college students jump from relationship to relationship while middle-aged singles take what they can get. But the (somewhat unscientific) evidence loosely suggests that we might not have as many chances as we think, and that the scenario above might not be completely abstracted from reality: On average, we only have two long-term relationships—two rolls of the die—before settling down for good.
Of course, dice games are far from a correctly specified model for love: The expectation of our happiness with our next romantic partner is near-impossible to pinpoint and ever-changing, and our relationships themselves aren’t just points on some goodness scale. It’s not a simple thing to leave a relationship as soon as you realize you could be better off on average with a new significant other, nor should we be indifferent to the risk of being forever alone at the end of the day.
As this column will note over and over again, all models are wrong, but some can be useful. We should not (and frankly could not) compute expectations over all our potential dating partners; rather, what we can take from rolling dice is an understanding that we ought to think a little less about what our perfect partner or best-case relationship might look like. It doesn’t make sense to wait for our soulmate to show up at our doorstep, just as it doesn’t make sense to wait until we hit a six when we only have a few rolls of the die. Though it might sound less-than-romantic to settle for better-than-expected, perhaps thinking about how lucky we are to be in our current relationships, and being consciously grateful for when we are happier than we otherwise should have been, is yet another path towards figuring out what love really is.

In theory, there’s nothing wrong with the friend zone. It supposedly describes a common phenomenon: you develop romantic or sexual feelings for your friend, but your friend doesn’t reciprocate. Boom, you’ve been friend zoned. It sucks, it’s awkward, and it happens to everyone, men and women alike.
Yet, even though the friend zone is a gender-neutral concept, it seems to be almost exclusively used by men to describe their relationships with women. Sometimes, men who use this term actually start off as good friends with a woman and develop feelings for her over time—a perfectly natural and innocuous phenomenon that nobody can control.
But more often than not, men complaining about the friend zone were never really friends with the woman at all. They simply wanted to get with the woman, did all sorts of nice things to try to woo her, and then accused her of friend zoning him when she turned him down. In this case, being friend zoned is nothing more than a euphemism for rejection—one that places the blame on the woman, rather than on the man’s own undesirability or incompatibility.
In my experience, women are much less likely to complain about being friend zoned. If they develop feelings for a man that are not reciprocated, women might be more likely to internalize the rejection and accept that her male friend just isn’t interested. Women may also be less quick to jump to the conclusion that he somehow owes her sex for all the time she spent with him.
This gender difference is telling. Women don’t complain about the friend zone simply because they don’t feel entitled to men’s bodies. At the end of the day, friend zoning has nothing to do with friendship and everything to do with entitlement over women’s bodies.
Think about all the men, both on the Internet and in real life, who complain about having been “totally friend zoned” by a woman they were trying to get with. Friend zoned men see themselves as long-suffering victims who invested time and energy into a woman only to be relegated to the role of “just a friend.” They held doors open for her, bought drinks for her, spent time with her, and even listened to her talk about her feelings. Doesn’t she owe him sex, after all he did for her?
No, actually. She doesn’t owe you anything. Friendship isn’t an exchange of favors, but rather the enjoyment of each other’s company. You don’t spend time with a friend because you expect something in return. Friendship is not a means to an end—at least, real friendship is not.
If you start talking to a woman and do nice things for her just because you want to have sex with her, that relationship was never friendship. That was just an attempt to have sex with her. And whether or not your attempt is successful is based purely upon if she wants to have sex with you, too—not how many drinks you buy for her or how much time you spend with her.
The friend zone suggests that women are machines that men can put kindness tokens into until sexual favors come rushing out. Unfortunately, that’s not how it works: women are humans who are attracted to some people and not others. Whom they choose to have sex or not have sex with is their own decision, and it’s one that other people ought to respect.
When you describe a woman’s refusal to have sex with someone as friend zoning, you are disrespecting her right to make that decision. The term, when used by a man, essentially communicates that he deserved to have sex with a woman, and is now being denied that right. It makes him angry and resentful towards the woman who denies him sex, because he feels like it’s something he deserves.
It was exactly this sense of entitlement that motivated Elliot Rodger, who killed six people and injured 14 in 2014. In his manifesto and accompanying video, he described his plan to invade a sorority house and “slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up, blond slut I see inside there. All those girls I’ve desired so much. They have all rejected me and looked down on me as an inferior man.” He vowed to “punish” them. Rodger specifically targeted attractive blonde women in his shooting spree and killed them for not having sex with him.
While many considered the shooting an exceptional case, this sense of entitlement is pervasive in society and manifests itself in equally pernicious ways. It is this sense of entitlement that leads women to experience violence when they reject the sexual advances of men—from getting attacked with acid, stabbed to death, raped and beaten, or smashed in the head with bowling balls and glass bottles. Male entitlement to female bodies manifests itself in bitter but harmless rants about the friend zone, but also in brutal acts of violence and murder.
The friend zone persists because it is a comforting idea. It’s tough being turned down. But even though getting rejected hurts, it’s important to respect the other person’s right to turn you down. No woman owes a man anything—least of all her body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, Harvard’s Houses collectively moved to designate dinner on Thursdays as “Community Night.” Spurred by the desire to foster community within the Houses, administrators developed this program to compel students to dine in their own residences with their Housemates at least once a week. This restriction on inter-House dining in the name of community had previously been staggered, occurring on different evenings in different Houses. The decision to settle on Thursday, according to then-Dean of the Office of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, was made in the name of simplicity. Now if it's Thursday evening, students need not look up the dining restriction calendar to know that they can’t eat anywhere but in their own House.
We understand that inter-House dining restrictions are a necessary evil. While we would all love to eat in Adams and Quincy in between our classes in the Yard, these two dining halls simply cannot accommodate everyone. That said, the system is unnecessarily complex as it stands. The need to create convenient eating space for undergraduates has given rise to a system of restrictions that needs to be streamlined, not complicated by the added variable of trying to foster community.
The present set of inter-House dining restrictions is too difficult for students to remember or keep up with. Each House has its own set of rules that differ by day and mealtime. Some Houses encourage their residents to bring an upperclassman guest; others ban guests altogether. Quincy, for example, bars freshmen from ever eating in its dining hall. As the busy undergraduates that we are, we sometimes struggle to fit in a quick bite to eat, let alone budget the time to wade through the long list of restrictions to figure out where we can eat.
Likewise, the ban seems counterintuitive more generally, as it hampers the integration of freshman into Harvard’s social community. If community night dining restrictions are meant to create community, they should shepherd upperclassmen to their own Houses voluntarily, not block freshman from connecting with older students who are eager to be mentors or friends to freshmen.
For students who require their dining halls to be accessible, however, the dining restriction system is more than just an annoyance. It is incomprehensible to keep students whose mobility is limited out of accessible dining halls in the name of community building. In such cases, blanket bans like Quincy’s on freshmen seem irresponsible. Until all dining halls are accessible, these restrictions pose an additional burden on students who use wheelchairs.
In the same way, instead of fostering House pride, community nights come across as attempts to force us to bond with each other. In actuality, most students end up simply sitting with their blockmates on Thursday evenings, foregoing the opportunity to meet members of their House because it feels forced. Meanwhile, other houses have instituted alternative bonding structures—like Lowell’s weekly tea—that are much more effective because attendance is optional. However the Houses try to foster community, it should be voluntary so that it does not foster resentment.
Placing unnecessary restrictions on students is almost never efficient. In the current scenario, community night hampers inter-House and inter-class socializing, instead of encouraging bonds within a House.
Harvard should eliminate Thursday night dining restrictions and replace them with a voluntary system that gives students the opportunity to be more involved with their respective Houses through truly engaging options, like Lowell's tea. Those who choose to participate will reap the benefits of the community they seek.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a friend asked me if I’m registered as a Democrat or a Republican, and my gut reaction was to respond with “I don’t know.”
For the record, I do know: I am a registered Democrat. And, were I given the chance to register anew today, I wouldn’t change my affiliation.
Yet the question seriously tripped me up. I babbled about how I’m proud to be socially liberal, but sometimes lean conservative, and I even assured him that I’m partial to Republicans because my grandfather is one, and I love him.
I’ve been thinking about why I danced around giving my opinion ever since. Why I preferred to ramble like an idiot instead of just stating the truth. And as I’ve been thinking about that one instance, I’ve realized that I often avoid voicing my opinions. Maybe even more often than not.
Which is weird, because I write for The Crimson’s Editorial Board. My job is to have opinions and to express them. And what’s more, I respect people with opinions. Opinions about fashion. Opinions about Kanye. Opinions about campus news or the presidential race. Well-researched, unapologetic, clear opinions.
You’d think I’d want to share my own.
The thing is, I’m afraid of what will happen if I do but then decide I’m wrong. With the Internet tracking my every move and thought, I feel as if I’m accountable for everything I’ve ever said. I feel like I’m going to be accused of betrayal or ideological inconsistency if, for whatever reason, I decide to change my mind.
More than ever before, we’re able to publicly and globally project our political and social values to whomever cares to read about them. We’ve created social environments where it’s easy to exchange opinions with people who see the world differently than we do. But instead of creating a platform for eye-opening conversation and maximum exposure, we’re fossilizing our opinions—tracking and setting them in stone. Instead of being free to explore ideologies as we please and adopt new ones as we see fit—God forbid!—we’re expected to remain steadfast in our beliefs for the sake of continuity.
So I wonder, at what point, on which topics, and in which scenarios is it okay to take a stance, listen to the opposing rebuttal, and then realize I’m wrong?
These days, I’m not sure I ever can. And that’s a problem.
Consider Hillary Clinton, who may be enduring more criticism than any other modern American for changing her mind. Pundits fairly point out that she’s revised her initial opinion on gay marriage and has now come out in favor of it. Likewise, she has criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership despite initially promoting it three years ago. At best, she’s accused of triangulating; in the past several months, she’s been called an “inauthentic” flip-flopper who alters her stance on policy issues at the whim of “polls and political pressure.”
Apparently, Clinton’s earlier support of the nascent Trans-Pacific Partnership precludes her from criticizing the deal today. Her previous statements against gay marriage have doomed her to eternal homophobic status. Somehow, it is unimaginable that Hillary Clinton, in the intervening years since she spoke out against gay marriage—or the TPP, or gun control, or immigration—may have realized that she was being insensitive or unsympathetic or simply wrong. And while it might be speculative to propose that this is why she’s changed her stance, it’s no more so than to argue that she’s doing it simply to win votes.
If Clinton is worthy of criticism, it’s not because she has switched her opinions, but rather because she is not willing to openly admit that she’s previously been wrong. I don’t blame her: That’s a scary thing to do.
I wish we’d do it more. I wish we’d humble ourselves when we realize we’re misinformed, or our alliances have shifted, or we’ve simply changed our values. I wish we’d give others the benefit of the doubt when they do the same.
Far be it from me to argue in favor of political party-hopping and its equivalent in other fields. Just as you can’t decide to like the Yankees when they’re playing well and the Red Sox on the rare occasion that they’re playing better, you don’t get to be feminist or liberal or conservative or anti-racism or pro-abortion or Team-Aniston-over-Jolie only when it’s convenient. You don’t get to momentarily espouse an ideology because it is temporarily easy.
I put a lot of pressure on myself to have opinions that are strong and controversial, opinions that will give rise to op-eds that I can publish in The Crimson. Opinions that will divide the student body in half, with a fiery contingent behind me and an even fierier one against me.
But I think we all—me, my peers, my grandparents, and maybe you—often forget that it’s possible to stand by our beliefs and also honestly explore other ideas and try them on for size. We forget that our opponents are smart too, that listening to them is not blasphemy. We forget that considering a thought is not the same as espousing it.
And worst of all, we’ve forgotten that sometimes it’s healthy to change our minds.

Last summer, I spent a month traveling alone, and two catastrophic events took place. In Belgrade I ran out of books—except for Martin Heidegger’s easy-breezy beach-read “Being and Time”—and in Sarajevo I got food poisoning. This meant that I spent my last 72 hours in the Balkans alone in my room, vomiting garlic-soaked lamb’s head, with nothing to do but read Heidegger. This was a terrible experience. But in the weird interplay between being alone and “Being and Time,” I came to understand why it was terrible—and that it might be for a good reason.

That reason requires a bit of background, so bear with me a bit if ontology isn’t your cup of tea. Heidegger was a 20th century German philosopher who believed his predecessors, from Plato to Nietzsche, had all made a fatal error in how they conceptualized the world. They presumed it was composed of distinct entities, entities that existed independently before coming into contact with each other. Heidegger, on the other hand, believed that people and objects were inseparable from their environment and were always co-creating each other. Developing the correct relationship to that co-creation determined whether one’s Being (and Time!) was “authentic” or “inauthentic.”
While in the Balkans, I’d developed a complicated relationship with that authentic-inauthentic binary. Weeks before the lamb’s head was present-in-toilet and ready-to-flush, I was spending a lot of time alone. With little access to home and only sparing interactions with locals, I would often spend days trapped in my head. Eventually, I entered a swirling, detached mental state, somewhere between stoicism and hallucination. Objects that I normally handled fluidly became confusing and fraught. Co-creation did not seem to be working the way that it should. I remember eating polenta one caffeinated morning in Belgrade and being fundamentally unable to tell if it was delicious or rotten—which, looking back, may have contributed to the food poisoning. Sunsets could become miserable, thunderstorms signs of peace. It was as if I could redesign my entire symbolic and emotional relationship with the world. First, it was disorienting. Then, it became frightening.
Heidegger, strangely enough, was a big fan of this mental state. For him, it signaled stepping outside “Das Man”: A social-conditioning force that means, literally, “the man”—as in, I’m getting screwed over by “the man”—but is often translated as the “they” or the “Others.” You can think of Das Man as an average opinion, or as received logic: not the specific objects and people co-creating you in the seminar room, but the larger social phenomenon that positioned you in that college. Heidegger thought that Das Man was the main driver of inauthentic Being. When we bumble along and believe in received logic—e.g., “Sunsets are pretty”—we are not thinking critically about what Das Man’s “idle chatter” is actually saying; about why we value anything we do. Authentic Being had something to do with being alone, with leaving all that chatter behind.
This was all rather validating in a find-yourself-abroad sort of way. But as the August weeks stretched on and I read further into “Being and Time,” my reality was becoming flimsier, not clearer. Sure, lonesome travel hushed that verbose Das Man, but it also pared down the meaning of whatever lay before me. My life’s slow pace allowed expansive looks at my past and future. Instead of just eating the polenta, I’d compare it to porridges I’d had before—and ones I’d soon see—in a mild form of dissociation that could last for hours. It soon became second nature to relativize the present.
That’s where the Time part of “Being and Time” came in. Heidegger believed that those who live authentic and inauthentic existences experienced time differently: Each has its own so-called temporality. Inauthentic temporality occurs when we forget the past, passively await the future, and exist solely in the present. It’s what we have to do to get through our work days, our papers, our midterms. We must forget, await, and exist if we want to be well-functioning members of society. But that also leaves us defenseless against Das Man. When we live only in the present, we naturally accept the average opinion, for we have nothing with which to compare it.
Authentic temporality is just the opposite. It considers the millions of potential futures we may have, the way past experiences have shaped us and our world, and recognizes with intense awareness how those eras coexist to create us, right here and right now. In being active and personal, it sets our trajectory apart from Das Man. By incorporating that principle of co-creation, it avoids that Platonic belief that entities arise in sundered worlds. This sort of Time tends to hit us at major events, like graduations, birthdays, and weddings. In those moments, we remember, we anticipate, and we examine. We can be critical or celebratory; we seem to flirt with transcendence. But if traveling alone let me do this to every bowl of polenta, why was I so miserable?
One reason, I think, is that I was addicted to the idle chatter of Das Man. I craved its social validation and social direction. I wanted to read on Yelp that the polenta tasted good; I wanted a travel guide to assure me how stunning a Danube sunset must be. Heidegger was aware of how trying this process could be. He thought that if one’s angst spiral didn’t involve thoughts of death, it wasn’t working properly. (No one ever said authenticity was cheery!) That’s always been a requisite hurdle to approach authentic Being. I also believe that some things have changed: Recent technological triumphs have fed our natural addiction to idle chatter, letting us fill any moment of lonesome angst with Das Man. It’s scrollable on Facebook, streamable on Netflix. The average opinion is always just a click away. We all used to wake up and go to bed with a good chunk of lonely, authentic temporality. These days, we have to flee to the Balkans.
It’s not just angst that we’re missing out on, though. Like most bad experiences—a workout, an exam, a tough conversation—there’s an endorphin kick at the end of the spiral. Being alone might lead to contemplating death, but it can also induce what Heidegger calls an “Augenblick,” or “moment of vision.” An Augenblick (I read between bathroom runs) does not quite escape Das Man’s world of Facebook scrolls and Netflix streams, but it lets us spot it for what it is. The end-goal is not isolation in a Sarajevo bathroom (thank god). Isolation is only that first step toward a more earnest and intentional relationship to our co-creating comrades. We can never escape social determinism, but we can decide how to treat it.
“Overnight,” Heidegger wrote, “everything that is primordial gets glossed over as something that has long been well known.” I think what he meant here is that the most intense moments, the flashes of authenticity, will always flatten into a narrative as we return to normal life. I finished “Being and Time,” recovered from food poisoning, slowly tuned back into Das Man. But every morning, in the chilled Lowell courtyard, I hope to access that primordial Augenblick. I pause, take a sip of coffee, summon Sarajevo or Housing Day or graduation, and try to fuse past, present, and future into some kind of an authentic temporality. To remember that I will die, that I could have but didn’t, that this is all unique and interconnected, that I am never really alone.

It goes like this: as much as S.Y. Lee’s parents love Hong Kong, they’re outta there the minute Mao says, “The revolution needs you!” S.Y. turns to her twin sister (who isn’t really listening) and says, “I’m gonna be a nurse!”
Turns out she won’t. When they get to China, she marches her entire 4 foot, 11 inch self up to the clinic and the guardians of the revolution say, “You, a nurse? Whose stretcher will you carry, a doll’s?”
Seething, she ignores them as they shout after her: “But introduce me to your sister—lookin’ at her awakens my proletariat, if y’know what I mean.” She almost tosses her biology textbook to the side of the road, but, well, the New China doesn’t have a lot of books. She keeps it and reads it on the way to and from her newly-assigned job in the accounting department of her factory work unit.

So we leave S.Y. single, watching her carbon-copy walk arm-in-arm with the Reddest of Guards, thinking: “At least after the revolution, I’ll be a learned intellectual and she’ll just be married.”
And then it goes: As much as Y.F. Luo’s parents love Hong Kong, the minute Japanese bombs hit that port they’re outta there. Y.F. remembers: “When I was young, teachers hung my paintings on the walls. After the invasion, they just used them like cloths to wipe away blood.”
Mao says: “No such thing as art for art’s sake”—sorry, kid. Y.F.’s family moves to the mainland. Y.F. gets a job doing logistical operations work in Guangzhou. A girl—tiny, bitter, determined—catches his eye, and before you can say “women hold up half the sky” his entire horizon re-centers on her.
What does a collectivized courtship even look like? Y.F. settles for an anatomically accurate brush painting of the atria and ventricles, and S.Y. bites. It’s only a couple months until S.Y. admits that the way to her heart is truly through the superior vena cava, so he’d had her from day one.
Mao says: “Marry late for the revolution!” “But,” Y.F. explains to his work unit supervisor, “it’s already pretty late for me, see?” And he shows his supervisor a single white hair (plucked from one of his calligraphy brushes, but no one’s telling). So Y.F. gets the O.K. from the danwei, and a week later the newlyweds are laughing and handing out candies at their Party-sanctioned party. The days ahead are tough—nobody has time to paint or read when their sons are getting sent to the countryside for farm work—but through it all, Y.F. remembers that S.Y. is the kindest person he’s ever known.
Years and years later, Mao dies, but not as fast as Y.F.’s and S.Y.’s hopes for art and scholarship. Y.F. hasn’t held a brush in years, and S.Y. can’t tell spleen from spine. S.Y. and her twin sister both immigrate to Canada. They meet up in Vancouver. It’s the first time they’ve seen each other since the New Marriage Law of 1950. Their husbands hit it off.
As much as my grandparents S.Y. and Y.F. love us, as soon as we start speaking English at the dinner table they’re outta there. I started learning Mandarin in middle school but still can’t say “pass the salt” without sweating; kept up just enough Canto to ask for the bill after dimsum.
The dining room empties more and more quickly. Grandma’s almost all the way deaf now and can’t remember if I graduated college yet. A few years ago, Dad called to tell me that Grandpa’s stroke had left him garbled: He could hear words in his head but when he went to ask for a glass of water, “elephant” would come out.
I know they must’ve fallen in love somehow, though, so over break I ask them how they met each other. Grandma said, “What?” as her hearing aid whined, and went back to reading the newspaper.
Grandpa said, “I—I—glass—no. Glass—no—can’t talk,” before clenching his fists in frustration and sighing. Me neither, man. I held his hand, rubbed his knurled skin with my thumb, and decided to hit the library instead.
The love song of K.Y. Lo goes: hours of HOLLIS+ skullduggery to better understand the People’s Republic, three-semesters-no-citation in Advanced Modern Chinese, and a transnational Asian Americanism that I don’t quite know how to study.
It goes: Do I dare disturb the university education that should ensure a post-grad nine-to-five job such that even if I become a writer on the side, I’ll still have a stable income to show for it? Because I don’t know what you’d rather see before you go.
It goes: If I’m too late for the revolution, I’ll make it up to you somehow.

Matthew E. Cappucci ’19 stands in front of the green screen and adjusts his tie, the same gray one that he wears for most of his forecasts. An off-camera monitor shows a storm creeping across a map of the East Coast. The digital reproduction is far more tame than some of the storms Cappucci has seen—he’s chased a fair number of tornadoes and hurricanes. A production assistant applies Cappucci’s makeup and feeds a microphone wire down the back of his shirt.
“We’ll be barbecuing way past dinnertime by June 1,” he says, motioning toward invisible figures on the Green Screen. The monitor shows Cappucci standing in front of a chart of sunset times, pointing to “June 1st—8:16 p.m.”
With Cappucci’s TV-ready voice and bumping electronic music that plays between takes, you’d never guess that this entire scene is taking place beneath one of the quietest spots on campus—Widener Library. The Hauser Studio, a state-of-the-art production facility located in the library’s basement, provides the set for Cappucci’s weekly forecast videos, which he posts to his Youtube channel.
At Harvard, Capucci has made a name for himself as the unofficial meteorologist of the Class of 2019 Facebook group. When students’ travel plans were threatened by snowstorms at the end of winter break, Cappucci responded to dozens of concerned commenters.
“Oh… that [flight is] not getting off the ground,” he replied to a student flying to Boston from California. “And if it does, that is NOT a flight I would want to be on!”
Cappucci’s forecast posts have continued since the beginning of second semester, predicting temperature and snowfall and sharing them with the Class of 2019.
“Good morning Harvard,” begins his post from Feb. 7. “Enjoy the sunshine today, because we’ll see another 7-10” of snow tomorrow!”
When one commenter said that the prospect of a snowstorm made her want to cry, Cappucci wrote, “Don’t cry! Those tears will just freeze onto your face. Even with the salt that will reduce freezing temperatures,” he explained further, “they’ll still crystallize because of the below-average conditions.”
Cappucci has put together a forecast every day for the last six years—to do this well, he tells me, one has to “get intimate with the weather.”
“You have to know what it’s doing at every moment,” he explains. “Whether it’s consciously looking at models and getting data and analyzing it, or just passive observation, you always have to know what’s going on.”
Cappucci’s fascination with weather began when he was two years old. During storms, he would go outside to watch lightning strike, or stay inside to observe anemometers spin. Cappucci hails from Cape Cod, Mass., a place that offers a host of interesting weather features.
“We have a little bit of everything,” he says. “Thunderstorms, tornadoes, droughts, severe weather—I think that’s what really kind of kindled my interest in meteorology.”
His encyclopedic knowledge of the subject is largely self-taught. Cappucci’s first formal training came at a meteorology camp he attended in ninth grade.
“The best experience was just to be around 11 other kids who shared my passion,” Cappucci recalls. “Whenever it was thundering, we’d all run outside. We’d all be tracking the radar.”
Running after storms has remained a part of Cappucci’s life. He lists storm chasing as one of his extracurricular passions. He tells me that storm chasing, which sometimes involves standing outside in 80 miles per hour winds or following tornadoes, is not as scary or difficult as many people think.
“If you know the science, if you know what you’re doing, you shouldn’t be caught off guard,” he says. “There are too many amateurs clogging up the roads.”
During high school, classmates and teachers depended on Cappucci for snow day predictions. He could usually call a snow day at least three days in advance, and was correct nine out of 10 times last winter. Cappucci pulls out his phone and shows me a collage of all-caps Facebook messages—he received more than 150 complaints after his one slip-up.
At Harvard, Cappucci has already begun to design his specialized concentration, Atmospheric Sciences, although he is still searching for a faculty advisor. He is cross-registered at MIT, where he’s currently taking a course.
At age 15, Cappucci presented at the annual conference of the American Meteorological Society; he was the youngest presenter in the convention’s history. Unsurprisingly, Cappucci’s end goal is to be a full-time weather reporter on television. Even in a casual conversation at Greenhouse Cafe, he speaks at prime-time speed and gesticulates as if there’s a map of the United States behind him.
Cappucci’s dream of a full-time job on television isn’t far out of his reach. With the production team at the Hauser Studio, he films his forecasts weekly. He was also recently hired as a field reporter for WeatherNation TV, a Colorado-based channel, and reports on some storms in the Boston area.
“I was out for six or seven hours the other day covering the snowstorm as it was moving in on top of the I-90 overpass,” Cappucci recalls. “I was standing there in the snow, but it’s what I love to do.”

America has seen a strong female candidate in two of the last three presidential elections. In fact, in some eyes, a woman’s name on the ballot might now seem almost commonplace. What (and who) happened to make this possible? Historian Ellen Fitzpatrick, author of “The Highest Glass Ceiling: Women’s Quest for the American Presidency,” weighs in.

FM: Given the upcoming election, your book seems timely. But you’ve written a number of books about women in history. What prompted your decision to write about women, and why women aspiring to the White House?
EF: I have studied both women’s history and political history, and what I have observed is that very few women historians are interested in the history of the presidency, for obvious reasons. And most presidential historians are not interested in women’s history, for obvious reasons. Most [presidential historians] are men, and there are no women [Presidents]. So this was a topic that had fallen between my two areas of interest, and I thought that this would be an opportunity to try to bring them together.
I didn’t know when I decided to write the book whether Hillary Clinton was going to run or not… I figured that probably there would be a woman candidate this time, but it might not be Hillary.
FM: A lot has been said about the role of gender in criticisms of Clinton and other female politicians. How did gender affect the campaigns of the women in your book? How is it influencing Clinton’s campaign?
EF: All of them had to deal with the prevailing ideas about gender from their different historical moments. Victoria Woodhull [the first female presidential candidate, who ran in 1872] faced very traditional ideas… which she violated in almost every respect. She was divorced, she was very radical, she was a free love advocate…. She was depicted as ‘lacking virtue’… and that led to one of the great celebrated sex scandals of the late 19th century.
Shirley Chisholm [the first African American major-party candidate of any gender, who ran in 1972] had a very devoted husband. She would be outraged when people would say to her, “Your husband must be a wimp. How can he be married to a woman running for President or Congresswoman?” She would say, “No, he’s very manly. You don’t know what he’s like.” But in fact he did devote himself to promoting her political career, and they did have a very traditional marriage in that respect.
None of these women could escape the gender stereotypes of their time, but all of them challenged them through their run for the presidency. At the same time, they had to demonstrate that they were upstanding, respectable women, even though they were doing something completely nontraditional that violated prevailing gender norms.
FM: You’ve talked about the enormous influence of Betty Friedan’s 1963 book, “The Feminine Mystique.” How did second-wave feminism influence the possibility of a female president? Did the women of your book think of themselves as feminists?
EF: I’ve had people say to me, “How can you consider these people feminists?” It was before the feminist movement. But yes, they were, all three.
Margaret Chase Smith [a woman who ran for the Republican nomination in 1964] denied that she was a feminist… She supported efforts to progress women’s equality… [and] she did a lot for women in her Congressional career. She was very interested in women’s issues. But [she was] uncomfortable with the label ‘feminist.’ She didn’t like the association. She didn’t want people to think she was like Gloria Steinem. She was a dignified Republican with pearls.
FM: Has third-wave feminism made it into federal politics? How has the role of feminism in politics changed since the eras covered in your book?
EF: The landscape for women has completely changed since the early ’60s…. The number of women in national politics is still miniscule compared to the number of men, but political parties were very much changed by the challenges that feminists, civil rights activists, and radicals made at the end of the ’60s and the early ’70s.
There are pieces in place in the foundation for someone like Hillary Clinton to build on. And no one has put the pieces together better than she has: the money, the patronage, the backing from party elites, the exposure to the public, the admiration.
But—if her husband hadn’t been President, if the country hadn’t come to know her as First Lady, if we hadn’t been through two terms of scandal and recovery, if she hadn’t become admired for standing by her philandering husband…. Her stock soared after he was impeached, because she stayed with him. A lot of feminists thought it was terrible, that she wasn’t a real feminist because she stayed with him… but the average person out there greatly admired her for it.
She blends these traditional and feminist components. She might have been in national public office, but she wouldn’t have gotten 18 million votes for president, if she didn’t have… all those other bits that she put together. That’s my view, anyway, and I’m sticking to it.

If someone told you that samurai warriors wage battle with bamboo swords on Harvard’s campus every night of the week, you would accuse the person of lying. And, of course, you’d be right. Harvard’s samurai only practice four times a week.
On Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, Harvard’s most unassuming soldiers arrive at gyms in the area ready to fight, donning protective headgear (“bogu”), bedazzled name tags (“zekken”), and, of course, bamboo swords (“shinai”).
This motley mesh of largely average-height, average-shaped, and occasionally balding Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, and alumni makes up one of the most physically (and spiritually) dangerous crews at the University: the Harvard-Radcliffe Kendo Club.
Founded in its current form in the early 1990s, the club exists almost entirely outside of the mainstream Harvard community. Its practices are conducted largely in Japanese, and members sometimes smack each other on the head with their swords. Despite the fact that they face off, though, members are quite close to one another.
“It’s kind of like a big family,” the club’s public relations officer, Mary B. Schleicher ’18, tells me. “We have socials where we all just get together and watch movies and eat snacks.”
But this camaraderie need not be mistaken for mercy: Harvard’s kendo fighters are not messing around. Their head coach (“sensei”) flies in from Japan to instruct them. They host the biggest kendo tournament in North America (called Shoryuhai), and their practices are hard to differentiate from a battle montage in a “Kill Bill” movie.
Before warm-ups officially begin, the warriors practice their sword strikes in the mirror, screaming with every swing of the shinai. Then the majority of the team lines up to face the two captains for a series of stretching-based, vocal warm-up rituals—picture a lesson of Shaun T’s “Insanity” conducted in Japanese. I half-expect one of them to say that his name is Inigo Montoya and inform me that I should prepare to die.
After stretching, introductions, and drills, the striking begins. This is when the Kendo Club’s practices transform from what seem like innocent expressions of body, mind, and spirit—filled with meditation (“mokuso”), joviality, and togetherness—into what looks like all-out battle.
Swords connect with heads. Screams connect with eardrums. I connect with the corner of the room. After trying to get the hang of swinging the shinai, my neuroses tell me I’d be better off sitting around and watching. But as vicious as kendo fights appear to be, many of the team’s members insist the sport is safe. “Nobody has gotten hurt actually fighting,” Schleicher assures me, before eventually conceding that “some people just hit like a truck, and you can’t avoid it.”
As the practice goes on, however, it becomes clear to me why the club’s members are so secure in their personal safety: They really care about one another. You see it in the way they help each other out with form, the way they instruct beginners, the way they smile when you ask what it was like the first time they picked up their shinais.

“The biggest thing kendo has given me is a space where I can be physically active and engage with other people,” the club’s vice president, Courtney C. Okwara ’18, says. “If I’m feeling stressed and have a p-set due, sometimes I just want to go to kendo.”
I don’t blame her. After all, while some of us here at Harvard treat friendship as networking and going to the gym as a path towards a “sweet bod, bro,” Harvard’s kendo fighters are not strictly focused on getting ahead or getting in shape. “Even not being in the best of physical states,” Schleicher notes, “I could still come in, practice with people, and feel like I’d accomplished something at the end of the day.”
Unlike other sports team practices, which often conclude with scrimmages and water breaks, last Thursday’s kendo practice ends with a birthday celebration. But rather than giving out gifts, the Harvard-Radcliffe Kendo Club blows out the proverbial candles by throwing a funeral. That’s right, the girl celebrating her birthday is told to make her way through the gym fighting one member of the club after another, fending off the team’s current co-captains, veterans, and one of the club’s founding members: a 53-year-old man who was introduced simply as “grandpappy.”
But the birthday girl's tireless efforts prove unsuccessful as she falls to the ground—proclaimed dead by her teammates.
“Don’t worry,” one of them tells me. “We don’t do this to beginners.”

Here’s the thing: I’m sitting in a plane on its way out of Boston, the whole city sparkling. It looks like a jewel when the camera pans over it in a helicopter shot during a commercial break in a football game. The seat next to me is empty, which is nice, and lonely.
This is the first flight in a while during which I haven’t called you to tell you I’m taking off, and I love you, and I’ll let you know when I land. I resisted because you’re not mine to call, and I’m not yours to hear from. Something in me whispered "Go", so I did.
When we were together, it was hard to go away: hard to go to Georgia, and Nebraska, and New York. I always wanted to see those people in those places, but I didn’t want to leave you. It always felt like we only had so much time, even though I saw you more than anyone else. I had to calculate opportunity cost. I would still go, but not for very long, and I would miss you while I was gone.
Now I miss you all the time. But I can go, and it doesn’t feel like it’s costing anything. I can stay as long as I want and not be afraid of missing you. I miss you, but I’m not missing you—if I were home, you wouldn’t be there.
In Boston, all the streets look like rivers. People complain that it’s not a grid, but I like it. In Manhattan, you can see all the way down the avenues. And that’s nice. But from up here, Boston looks like a patchwork quilt, and no straight lines last long. You can tell it was built a little at a time, with more attention to the curves of the river than to convenience of navigation.
Once, in an airport in Kansas, I found a card that said: “Make sure you don’t get too comfortable and fall asleep and miss your life.”
I don’t think I could end up in a city without a river.
I do think I could end up with you. But not for a while. Other things need to happen first. Other people and places and planes. The summer we were first together, I went to a wedding in Chicago. My cousin asked if we were going to get married, and I said I doubted it, but I’d consider myself lucky if we did.
When we were in an airport in Tampa, I told you I wasn’t sure I ever wanted to get married, but I wanted to have a wedding.
When we were in an airport in Boston, and you were on your way to Tampa, you kissed my forehead and told me it was going to be O.K. You kissed my lips, too, but I remember the forehead kiss more vividly.
When we were 36,000 feet in the air, halfway between your city to mine, I hid my head in your shoulder and you rubbed my back. There was a toddler behind us who couldn’t stop crying. His mother kept trying to get him to be quiet, but he said, “I can’t help it, I’m just so sad.”
When my grandfather died, you made me a mix CD called “Songs for a Plane Ride to Nebraska.” One of the songs on it was “Such Great Heights,” and another was “The World Spins Madly On.”
Flying over Nebraska, you see fields of corn and soybean spreading wide in every direction, square gold and green plots rippled in curved patterns for irrigation. Each plot has a big house and barn in one corner, with a dirt road running off the main highway. Flying at night, you  see almost nothing at all.
I am glad that something in me whispered, "Go," so that I wouldn't get too comfortable and fall asleep and miss my life. I’m glad that I’m going, and I’m glad that I miss you, and I’m glad that I’m out here alone in the sky above my jeweled river city. I broke our hearts and I don’t regret it, most of the time. Being without you is lonely, and nice.
I didn’t tell you that I’m taking off, or that I love you. But I am, and I do.

B: When we decided to write an article about Tasty Burger, I was torn. On one hand, it’s an iconic Harvard institution, and the title would be just click-bait-y enough that people might actually take time from browsing Facebook in section to check it out.
A: On the other hand, Tasty Burger is never where I want to end up. Ever. And I expressed this to Ben.
B: Violently. He spat a little. So we decided to take the Miley Cyrus approach and have the best of both worlds. We’d write about Tasty Burger, but from the comfort of our bedrooms. Or maybe from the comfort of Shake Shack, Bartley’s, or Four Burger, all establishments that have enough self respect to close before 2 a.m.
A: Okay but it’s one thing to close at 2 a.m., and quite another to basically be a gas station bathroom with a portable George Foreman Grill. I walk into Tasty Burger and feel forever unclean.

B: And this is coming from someone who takes, by the most conservative of estimates, at least four showers a day and who once threatened to “end me and all that I love” when I put my bare feet on his bed. But I digress. Like all the best plans of mice and men (although all the plans made by the mice I know, i.e. eating my food and scaring the shit out of me, have been successful), our clever scheme to evade journalistic responsibility came crashing down around us.
A: What we originally lacked in integrity we made up for in hunger, so we decided to roll to the Market and eat some yummy sandwiches while we wrote this piece. We threw on jackets and began our trek from Mather, figuring the cold wouldn’t be too bad. We were wrong.
B: I’m the type of New Englander who usually just throws on a sweatshirt and calls it a day. Andrew is from Connecticut, so I actually don’t know any stereotypes about him besides the fact that he’s sad about General Electric leaving or whatever. But this cold redefined the word. I’ve hiked through winter storms on mountaintops and still had the breath to belt out a few choice verses of Frozen, but this was the kind of chill that made me wish I had a second hoodie on. It drove us mad. So mad, we were forced to betray our most central of principles.
A: I cocooned myself in Ben’s trademark overcoat and still felt the wind rip into my soul. My life felt like that scene in “Inside Out” when all of the orbs start to turn blue with sadness, except with cold. I tried to cry, but the air froze my tears in my eyes and forced me to weep dryly.
B: Okay. I had my shit a little more together than that.
A: Ben, you literally texted your girlfriend to tell her that you loved her. Don’t tell me you weren’t preparing for the worst.
B: Well you... had no proof of that. Once I delete all the texts from my phone.
A: Right, anyway, we kept our heads down and did that half-jog thing through Quincy courtyard. At one point, I asked Ben if we should just go back.
B: I think in my delirium, I just kind of assumed that Mather had been lost to the snow. Without Dean Lassonde to tell me otherwise, I just started singing “We Can’t Stop” and Andrew took the hint.
A: I think it was during one of my rare glances up from the pavement that I saw it. The neon sign with its familiar, shudder-inducing script. Tasty.
B: Burger. Tasty Burger.
A: Ben, that was my moment! You ruined the big reveal.
B: Sorry.
A: The “restaurant” had white cups and sweaty bodies everywhere. People eating bad food like they didn’t care. Everything I hated in a single scene. But in that moment, I also felt weakness.
B: Look, it was either trek to Market and feel like mortal human beings as we freeze to death or abandon our principles and enter the First Circle of Hell.
A: Overall, Ben and I probably choose to abandon our principles nine times out of ten. This was one of those times. But our decision was not without justification. Our bodies were gelid and we felt like two hyperboreans of Greek mythology. The Cambridge zephyr was harsh, unyielding, and seemed to have been summoned by Elsa herself. In contrast, Tasty Burger was balmy, temperate, and inviting. There was a not insignificantly-sized crowd of people in the interior of the space. One could say a solid plethora of folks had gathered beneath Tasty’s roof.
B: Uh, yeah, to translate: It was full of people and warm.
A: For the sake of my upstanding reputation, I want to reiterate that I did not want to be at Tasty Burger. I’ll admit that it provided shelter from the unspeakable winter climate, but Tasty Burger and me didn’t suddenly become friends, okay?  I wouldn’t ever pset with Tasty Burger. If Tasty Burger were sitting in the Mather dhall, I would sit down somewhere else. And even if Tasty offered a free burger promotion via text after an e-coli outbreak, you still would not see me darken its doorway. I used Tasty for its warmth and nothing else.
B: And Tasty’s personality was shit. It presented its own layer of threat. In the crush of bodies, I briefly lost Andrew. All around me wafted the smells of post party: Rubinoff and sweat. The tide of flesh wafted me one way, and then the other. I stumbled, tripping on a pointlessly intricate origami burger wrapper. A stranger caught me in his meaty arms. “Tony?” He rumbled, pulling me in close. I tried to insist that I was not, in fact, Tony, but he was too addled to understand.
A: I scrolled through Reddit for like a minute and when I looked up, Ben was gone. Scanning the crowd, I saw him by the soda dispenser. A man who could only be described as the human incarnation of Tasty Burger was hugging him and Ben was pushing him away. Holding down my innate disgust for what I had to do, I plunged into the crowd. After a chorus of insincere cries of “Excuse me!” I made it to Ben and pulled him out.
B: Moving hand in hand to stay together, like preschoolers, we navigated to the windows. Above the din, I shot Andrew a look. I filled it with all the fear and loathing and the aching agony that my soul contained, crying, laughing, pleading.
A: I looked back at Ben to see his typical hangry face. Red, scrunched-up, and infantile, it was hideous. I knew he wasn’t going to last long. One look at the long line of vagrant drunks convinced me Ben didn’t have time to wait for some mediocre burger. I knew what we had to do. Though there was a voice inside my head saying “You’ll never reach it,” I made the executive decision to soldier on to the Market. With Ben clutching my arm insisting he wasn’t Tony, we opened the grease-laced door and plunged into the night.

It is nearing 3 a.m. I have been standing almost continuously for well over 12 hours. The heels of my feet and the curve of my back are throbbing with a dull ache. A “Say Yes to the Dress” marathon on a small television behind me fills the hollow silence. The drama at Kleinfeld Bridal is starting to get old.
Still, I am having far too much fun to stop. Smeared with a messy patchwork of colorful splotches, I have a single goal: Make the icing atop the bottom left sliver of my cake mirror the pulsating lines of the bridge in Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” a little more closely. My past attempts at this corner have rendered the bridge too streaky or too dark or   too abstract. Not quite right. The icing is forgiving, though; I can scrape off the old attempts and try again. I will not call it a night until Munch himself would eat this slice. 
Allow me to explain: I like to make famous paintings out of cake.
With icing as my paints, cakes as my canvases, and food dyes as my pigments, I aspire to turn out-of-the-oven sweets into museum-ready masterpieces. Over the past three years, I have spent days and nights bent over cakes, squinting in the lamplight as I seek to conjure up the magic that Vincent van Gogh once hit upon in a paint-splattered studio in France or the beauty that Johannes Vermeer long ago captured in a dusty home in the Netherlands. Tedious though the hobby may be, I have found no sweeter thrill than the moment in which I mix two dyes and Mark Rothko’s shade of fire-engine red appears in my bowl. I have come across no more delectable pleasure than the instant in which the eyes of my edible “Girl with a Pearl Earring” begin to gaze up at me with the alluring expression that blankets the face of Vermeer’s jewelry-clad model.
I crafted my first art cake at the end of my junior year of high school. Fresh off of a year of AP Art History, I set out to make my longtime favorite painting, “The Starry Night,” out of cupcakes. With no baking experience to fall back on and a cupcake cookbook as my only aid, I had no clue whether I had bitten off more (cake) than I could chew—but 13 hours and three containers of icing later, to my delight, my re-creation seemed, just maybe, to echo the frenzied splendor of the original. This initial foray into dessert design literally and figuratively whet my appetite to continue making art cakes.
Every cake that I have made since has presented an exciting set of challenges to address. “American Gothic” called upon me to figure out how to shade the icing—I wanted that sky to fade from a cobalt blue to a pastel tint, those treetops to plunge from a pear green to a lemon yellow, that dusty pair of overalls to slide from a shadowy navy to a light denim hue. “Sunday on La Grande Jatte” posed the question of how to eliminate figures without losing the spirit of Georges Seurat’s pointillist creation. “The Scream” taught me to use toothpicks to perfect finer details like the screamer’s horrified pupils. “Girl with a Pearl Earring” dared me to test whether the techniques that can bring van Gogh’s billowing cypress tree to life could also express the subtlety of a lady’s upturned lips.
As I have grown more ambitious in the size of my cakes and more dedicated to the details, my cake-making attempts have become increasingly time consuming: My latest project, “A Sunday on La Grande Jatte,” stretched on for about five days before I finally declared it complete and placed it into the shiny gold frame in which I always display my finished cakes. Even my six tiny Rothko cookies took up a whole afternoon. But I find the pastime energizing rather than exhausting, perhaps because it is so unlike the pace of the rest of my life. In the countless hours that I spend mixing the most vibrant color of icing or shaping the handsomest icing pitchfork, I have no outside responsibilities. No matter what my inbox or my Google Calendar say, I have only one item on my to-do list that day: Let my imagination run wild. That spirit of creative freedom is the icing on the cake of the whole process.
As typically presented, art can feel very impersonal. When we stand in museums, surrounded by paintings we have never seen and artistic movements we have never studied, it is all too easy to think that art has little relevance. I worry that the detached nature of art threatens its future popularity. And I think that pursuits like art cakes might be the solution.
In my mind, if art stands a chance at generating enthusiasm, we each need to forge individual relationships with artwork—to make art our own. We can forge these relationships in so many different ways, from conversing about a Renoir painting over dinner, to hanging a Degas poster in a dorm room, to posing as a Rockwell illustration, to taking a selfie with a Rodin statue, to making a painting out of cake. When we interact with a work of art, we  form a one-on-one bond with it. I believe those sparks of connection can keep art history classes full, museum doors open, and art lovers abundant.
Indeed, when I gazed upon “The Starry Night” at the Museum of Modern Art, or when I twirled around in a Rothko-filled room at the Phillips Collection, or when I visited the Frick Museum to get a glimpse of “Girl with a Pearl Earring,” I was not just looking at any old paintings—I was, in a way, looking at my paintings. I had participated in those paintings; I had given those paintings personal meaning; I had made those paintings special to me.
And I had snacked on a lot of cake along the way—so I guess you could say I had my cake and ate it, too.

Brian “Foundation” Shimanuki wins another game.  After shaking hands with his opponent, Foundation walks back to his seat with a grin. An enthusiastic crowd cheers on their clear favorite.
It is 9 p.m. in Cambridge. It the last Saturday night in January, and this is the Battlecode finals.
In the game of Battlecode, a red team and a blue team face off.  Each team aims to kill the other’s archons—special units that can create other units—while protecting its own archons from attack. Teams employ various basic strategies (defend and gather the resources scattered around the map, attack early and often in the hopes of a quick victory, etc.) and endless minor permutations of those strategies. It’s a complicated, slightlier nerdier sort of chess. 
Unlike chess, though, Battlecode, founded in 2001 and run by MIT students, is not actually played by humans. At least, not directly. Instead,  two computer programs control every decision made during gameplay.
Teams use the month of prep to strategize, but they also spend it translating and coding that strategy into Java. It’s not the two teams that are competing:  It’s their respective programs. By the finals, results are essentially decided. If there’s a problem in your strategy now, it’s too late to change it.
The big twist this year is zombies. Zombies attack any unit, red or blue, within their line of sight, and they get stronger as the game progresses. Foundation’s whole strategy centers around zombies. Instead of creating his own army, he only creates scouts, units that are very fast, but unable to attack. The scouts find zombies and lead them to the enemy.
Foundation ultimately places fourth, but the crowd adores him, and his competitors fear him. On Foundation’s “team wall” on the Battlecode website, an adversary and admirer writes, “You twisted, cruel bastard. 10/10 strategy.”
Though MIT students organize the event, competitors from all over the world can submit code. The final tournament, an hours-long, 16-team affair, features teams from Germany to nearby Harvard.
The Harvard team, “what_thesis,” has far fewer opportunities for such CS-centered gaming on their own campus.
Indeed, when it comes to computer science in Cambridge, there’s little doubt that MIT has the more established culture and curriculum. It boasts more students, more professors, more interest from recruiters, and much higher rankings. Differences between the two schools don’t stop there. Where Harvard’s campus is picturesque, MIT’s is stark. Where Harvard students have “concentrations,” MIT undergrads major in a number—6 for Computer Science, 2 for Mechanical Engineering.
Much like in Battlecode, though, disparities between the computer science communities at Harvard and MIT are probably due in large part to the way each was programmed. About 100 years ago, Harvard was programmed, more or less, to neglect Engineering in general, and Computer Science in particular. To understand that Harvard’s computer science department seems comparatively underdeveloped, look to the man who coded Harvard: Harvard’s 21st president, Charles William Eliot.
Maria Stoica ’17  checks her email in the Eliot House dining hall. Though she seems at ease, Stoica is not the sort of student Eliot, Harvard Class of 1853, would have imagined at Harvard. While he certainly opposed allowing women at Harvard, Eliot’s real problem with Stoica would have been her studies. Stoica is a computer scientist, an engineer. Harvard is a liberal arts college. In Eliot’s mind, those things shouldn’t mix.
“The practical spirit and the literary or scholastic spirit are both good, but they are incompatible,” wrote Eliot in an 1869 piece in The Atlantic dubbed “The New Education.” “If commingled, they are spoiled.”
This article, many believe, landed Eliot the Harvard presidency. He penned it as a chemistry professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Feb. 1869. Months later Eliot assumed the Harvard presidency. Stoica also made the move from MIT to Harvard, transferring between her sophomore and junior years to find a “well-rounded ” culture that she felt MIT lacked.  She wanted the kind of “co-mingling” of disciplines that Eliot so excoriated in 1869. 
Over the course of his presidency, Eliot tried many times to absorb MIT into the Harvard umbrella, coming closest to success on his last attempt in 1905 before MIT alumni and faculty successfully rallied against the merger.
Perhaps frustrated by his last failure, Eliot absorbed Harvard’s formerly independent Lawrence Scientific School into the College in 1906. The move marked  a complete reversal from Eliot’s position in “The New Education.” In that essay, he advised against putting “scientific schools” in the same organizational wing as the more established fields (the classics, philosophy, etc.) A scientific school within a college, Eliot wrote in 1869, “is the story of the ugly duckling.”
The younger Eliot was right. Harry R. Lewis ’68, professor of Computer Science and former interim Dean of Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, blames the Lawrence Scientific School-College merger for “effectively put[ting] engineering and applied science in a backwater” for close to a century. With some notable exceptions, Harvard engineering remained an ugly duckling. 
In the mid-70’s when MIT (1974), Stanford (1965), and Berkeley (1968) already had Computer Science departments, Harvard remained opposed. In around 1978, Lewis, then a non-tenured assistant professor, proposed a computer science degree at an Engineering faculty meeting; computer science was part of the Applied Mathematics department at that time. According to Lewis’s blog “Bits and Pieces,” Bernard Budiansky, an applied mathematician, opposed the idea, asking, “We’ve never had a major in automotive science, why would we have one in computer science?”
Budiansky’s gripe seems straight out of Eliot’s writings. Eliot was fine with teaching most subjects, but “they should be taught at the university on a higher plane than elsewhere.” Computer science, in Budiansky’s mind, was a practical and technical skill. It wasn’t until 1984 that Harvard awarded its first undergraduate degree in Computer Science, and by that time other programs had almost a decade’s head start.  By and large, the early adopters (the MITs, the Stanfords, the Berkeleys) are the top programs today.
In colleges across the country, the debate continues over what computer science actually is. A mélange of poorly defined terms (coding, hacking, computer programming, computer engineering, etc.) are routinely used to describe the field and a bevy of online services (Codeacademy, Code.org, Launch Academy, etc.) advertise a quicker, cheaper route to a job than a four-year degree in computer science. 
A Wall Street Journal op-ed published last August titled “Why I’m Not Looking to Hire Computer Science Majors” blamed computer science departments for not adequately preparing their students for the industry. The op-ed criticized the lack of iOS and Android development classes in Ivy League universities like Yale and Harvard. This is a common enough complaint at Harvard, and even at MIT, where students believe the department favors the theoretical over the applied. For Tomas A. Reimers ’17, though, studying computer science is like studying Spanish literary theory: if you’re going to learn it at all, you have to learn it in Spanish.
“There’s… this, ‘You need to learn Spanish’ portion, and that’s what programming is,” says Reimers. “Then there’s proper CS, which is how you think about data structures and algorithms and things like machine learning and visualization.”
Regardless of how you define it, computer science has become immensely popular. Harvard’s Computer Science department climbed from 69  concentrators in the 2007-2008 school year to 348 this year, with an inflection point coming, a chuckling Lewis points out, right around the release of the Facebook-inspired “Social Network.”
A $50 million dollar gift to Harvard Computer Science from former Microsoft CEO Steve A. Ballmer ’77 (with the Ballmer-esque edict to put Harvard “on that list” of top computer science schools alongside MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon) and a record-breaking, school-renaming $400 million from Business School alumnus and hedge fund manager John A. Paulson have given Harvard the capacity to grow computer science like never before. Throw in an historic $1 billion move to Allston, which Lewis has called “the Promised Land,” and the CS department is looking at a future of sustained growth into uncharted territory.
Harvard’s neighbor down Mass. Ave., though, has been running massive computer science operations for a while. Harvard CS won’t reach the size of MIT’s department any time soon.
Its growth, however, has made the University question the way it has operated since Eliot’s tenure. What is the ideal balance between extracurriculars and scholastic pursuit? What is the proper amount of corporate involvement in a university education? What is the best way to introduce students to a subject? MIT has (at least in part) answered many of these questions, and Harvard must, too, as enrollment and investment in computer science reach a fever pitch.
At MIT, students mostly engage with the computer sciences through their academics. Harvard CS, on the other hand, is as much about what happens outside the classroom as it is about what happens in it, with Harvard students choosing to focus more on the extracurricular side of their CS studies.
None of the real rockstars of Harvard CS, after all, ever graduated from the school. Both Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg quit early to commit to their respective start-ups full time.
Even those who don’t go so far as to drop out, though, look for ways besides academia to pursue computer science. Between working as a teaching fellow, joining an organization like the Harvard Computer Society, or working for fun on side-projects or start-ups, Reimers says computer science “allows you to focus all of your energy on it.”
“If you want to dump your life into computer science, [the subject] very much encourages that,” says Reimers. “In fact, it rewards it.”
But then, Harvard students are notoriously committed to life outside of the classroom. The proportion of students who self-reported spending more than 10 hours a week on extracurriculars rose from 27 to 43 percent between 2010 and 2013, according to data from the Senior Survey.
According to Divya Shanmugam, an MIT junior in Computer Science, life is the classroom. “I would say that classes take up a majority of your time, and then if you manage everything well you can do extracurriculars,” says Shanmugam. “I’m starting to quit my extracurriculars and say, ‘I am here just for the classes.’”
Shanmugam was drawn to MIT as a high school senior in part because of the “starkness” of the campus and the “no frills education” that it seemed to promise. This ascetic ideal of pure academics is foreign to MIT Computer Science professor David R. Karger ’89, who took music classes and sang in a choir during his undergraduate years at Harvard.
“[Some] people take nine courses in a semester and ace them all ... It’s very hard in that environment to hold back and say, ‘I want to have time,’”  says Karger.  “I can’t imagine having time to do that with the kind of course loads that MIT students face.”
MIT also boasts a conventionally stronger department, mostly due to its size. When it comes to computer science departments, size matters. Harvard CS, according to new Harvard hire and former MIT professor Madhu Sudan, has always had a reputation for strong individual professors (including two winners of the Turing Award—a sort of Nobel Prize for computing) but a weak overall department. It lacked “critical mass.” 
Since 2007, Harvard CS faculty has grown from 19 professors to 32. Harvard has 12 electrical engineering professors. MIT’s Electrical Engineering & Computer Science department, meanwhile, has 165 professors. There are more MIT EECS professors in the prestigious National Academy of Engineering than there are total Harvard CS professors. Unsurprisingly, MIT also offers many more computer science courses.
While Stoica, who has taken courses at both schools, says the workloads are comparable, Roger Zou ’17, former president of the Harvard Computer Society, says he got the sense from summer colleagues at Google that MIT was “more rigorous for sure.”
“MIT has a lot more courses that are on the same level of rigor as the Operating Systems Course [CS161] as well as, of course, a greater selection of courses,” says Zou. “They’re more famous, they’re better taught. But that’s just because, you know, [they’re] MIT.”
If MIT CS classes are hard, Harvard’s are no walk in the park, either. Zou himself determined as much when he “scraped” the Q Guide and wrote up the results in a Medium post. According to Zou’s analysis (which includes a number of caveats, including some duplicates in his dataset that could potentially skew results), CS classes have the heaviest workload at 10.7 hours per week, about five hours more than the average workload.
Hana C. Kim ’16 says that the Q guide, whose current highest rating option for workload is “greater than 14” hours per week, should include more demarcations over 14 hours.
“I’m on the longer side of the spectrum, but some of those classes will take 20, 24, 30 hours [a week]. So you want to know the gradient up there too, you know?” says Kim. “I expect all my CS classes to take way greater than 10 hours.”
Some courses, like CS161, are notoriously grueling. On the first day of class, Professor James Mickens, taking a leaf out of the U.S. Marine Corps’ book, flashed a powerpoint slide that read, “Pain is weakness leaving the body.”
At MIT,  6.172 (another CS course) is similarly fear-inducing. A “performance engineering” class, 6.172 teaches students how to take basic programs and make them as fast as possible.
“[6.172] can end up being a 40-hour-a-week class because they don’t really give you a benchmark for how fast [you can] make this,” says Shanmugam. “It’s just like, ‘Go forth, make it fast.’”
Karger says he worries that the workload of computer science, especially at MIT, is too demanding.
“[When I was an undergraduate], I didn’t feel like I was in a permanent state of exhaustion from trying to manage this massive workload. I do feel like that’s the state at MIT,” Karger says. “I’m pretty sure that MIT students come out having studied a lot more stuff than Harvard students. It’s not clear to me that that’s at all important to their futures.”
According to Shanmugam, while it’s relatively common for Harvard students to take CS classes at MIT, MIT students generally cross-register with Harvard only for humanities or language classes, like the Tamil class Shanmugan takes at Harvard.
If there’s one Harvard course MIT students know, though, it’s CS50.
Zou came to Harvard intending to concentrate in Government, but freshman fall he “took CS50, and everything changed.”
He spent his freshman summer programming his own iOS app, his sophomore summer working at Youtube, and plans to work for Square this coming summer. His aluminum Square water bottle and laptop, which bears two Youtube decals, sit on the table in front of him.
“I took CS50, and everything changed,” is a common enough line for Harvard CS concentrators, but at MIT, the norm, anecdotally at least, is to have some background knowledge of computer science before college.
CS50, Lewis says, “creates a lot of converts.”
“You just have to give the credit to Professor Malan here, but Professor Malan is himself a convert to computer science,” says Lewis. “He was a Gov major until he took CS50 and it changed his life, and he believes that it will change your life, so he’s got the evangelical spirit.”
Though CS50 is a common enough starting point for CS majors, it has little in common with the rest of the department. Professor Greg Morrissett, who from 2009 through 2015 taught CS51, the course after CS50, used to begin his lectures with a short, clipped parody of Malan’s signature line: “This is not CS50.” The opener was always met with enthusiastic applause.
According to Morrissett, the remark was meant to poke some fun at the branding efforts of the “CS50 machine,” but also to let students know that the course would have less support (fewer teaching fellows and video walkthroughs) and be more challenging than Malan’s well-funded, meticulously choreographed operations.
Morrissett, among others, feels that CS50 is not particularly representative of the other CS courses in the department, though he says the difference benefits students.
“The faculty and school decided that it was important to invest heavily into CS50 in order to open up the exciting world of computing to as many Harvard students as we possibly could,” Morrissett, who left Harvard for Cornell at the end of last year, wrote in an email. “So in this sense, no, CS50 doesn’t give students a good feel for what will happen with subsequent courses—they’re not going to get David Malan and they’re not going to get this amazing support staff and organization.” 
CS50 is unique in other ways as well. In addition to a sizeable Harvard undergraduate enrollment, CS50 was last semester’s most-enrolled course at Yale and also boasts an extensive online audience via the online education non-profit edX. CS50’s intellectual property was also the subject of an apparent tussle between Malan and Harvard for the course’s trademark.
All this programming doesn’t come cheap. CS50 is the only Harvard course with corporate sponsors, a practice that has drawn criticism from Harvard undergraduates and MIT professors alike. Karger says CS50’s sponsorships make him “queasy.”
“The course [should not be] a job fair. I really get that sense from CS50. It’s funny, you can see the energy, the enthusiasm that CS50 creates. It’s not clear that we need to have energy and enthusiasm created,” says Karger. “There’re all these people pouring into computer science; I would almost rather they get an introductory course that really tells them what computer science is.”
Lewis, however, sees no problem with corporate sponsorship.
“I think it’s great any time anybody wants to make an investment in our program,” says Lewis. “So I don’t think it’s a problem as long as they’re not setting an agenda for what we’re actually teaching.”
Lewis sees corporate funding as a necessary means to expanding access to education.“Bernie Sanders says education should be free to everyone, all the time,” he says. “Great, but the way the world works, we actually need money to keep our programs running.”
MIT CS Professor Srini Devadas, the current chair of the EECS Curriculum Committee, is similarly uncomfortable with corporate sponsorship of an undergraduate class.
“I fundamentally dislike that idea. I hate the idea of mixing sponsorship into undergraduate classes. I mean, I’m a little surprised honestly,” says Devadas. “If someone tried to do that here, I mean, I wouldn’t get violent, but I’m getting a little worked up here. I don’t think we would do that.”
Malan declined multiple times to respond to these criticisms in person or on the phone, later sending an email statement which read “CS50 is indeed a large and, in turn, expensive operation, and we gladly accept support from industry and alumni to provide students with all the more resources and opportunities.”
Devadas acknowledges that a number of MIT wintersession activities as well as upper-level research classes (known as SuperUROPs) do have corporate sponsorships (though MIT’s Dean of Undergraduate Education Dennis Freeman says that the university “is very careful to distance the companies from the students”). While Devadas says that he teaches MIT’s introductory programming class in Python in part because it’s “a language that could get people a summer job,” he still has reservations about CS50’s sponsorships.
“You have to be very careful when you do these things,” Devadas says. “Let’s not send the wrong message at the freshman level. Why don’t we just teach them how to program?”
Battlecode—which, with a course number of 6.147, counts as a half-course for MIT undergraduates—is one of the sponsored Wintersession activities Devadas mentions.
Indeed, after each round of the Battlecode final tournament, a different corporate sponsor makes their way up to the Kresge stage. Oracle (“Integrated Cloud Services”) touts its stellar work-life balance. Cruise (“Join the Driverless Revolution”) paints itself as a great modernizer, pioneering the self-driving car (somehow, though, the AV hook-up to their promotional video is bungled; the Battlecode directors gamely take the blame). Bloomberg’s presenter starts off with an enthusiastic, though tepidly-received, “Good evening Battlecode-icans!” Their pitches, though, all more or less boil down to the same message: Working here is a lot like Battlecode. We solve cool problems. We’re hiring.
While only a select few company representatives get to speak during the event, all sponsors are allowed tables at a mini-career fair of sorts in the foyer an hour before doors open. Students, munching on Battlecode-supplied pizza, engage in small talk with the recruiters.
A recruiter from Facebook tells a student that “WhatsApp has been notoriously efficient.” Recruiters ask how people feel about staying local versus moving west, and every table has some sort of goodie to give out. T-shirts, water bottles, key-chains, umbrellas all branded with the appropriate company logo are handed out like pamphlets at a political rally. Uber shows up without merchandise, just a few boxes of cookies to lure students. 
While all sponsors are eager to talk to MIT computer scientists, some are less eager to talk to press. Apple declines to chat for reasons of “confidentiality,” and DE Shaw is similarly tight-lipped. A representative from Oracle, one of Battlecode’s platinum sponsors, though, talks about the company’s “huge affinity for MIT and the MIT community” and mentions that all the Course 6 students at Battlecode are a draw. PDT Partners also cites the huge concentration of computer science majors at MIT as a reason to recruit there.
Most sponsors stick around until Monday to go to the XFair, a tech-focused career fair held in MIT’s gym  which drew 111 tech sponsors this year. Xfair is one of two popular student-run career fairs on campus. The other, the MIT Fall Career Fair, is by far the larger of the two.
The fall fair routinely attracts over 300 companies, most of whom are desperate for software engineers. So large is the demand for Course 6 majors that some students have taken to calling the fair “Course 6 Appreciation Day.”
Freeman, MIT’s dean of undergraduate education, worries that incoming freshmen might be driven to study computer science largely because “they see all the job offers [at the fall fair] are for the people in CS.”
Sophie Goemans, a junior majoring in 7 (Biology), says that every MIT student, “at some point or another, claims that they’re going to do CS at MIT.”
“You come here and you look at the CS’s and you’re like, ‘Oh my god, these people are literally going to be Forbes Fortune 500. They’re gonna be in that crowd,’”Goemans says.
While Karger says the financial security of a career in tech is certainly a draw, the opportunity to work in an exciting field also attracts students.
“[It’s] not just money, but [also] a good career,” he says. “That doesn’t only mean money, it means doing fun stuff, having an impact on the world. Computing is a great opportunity to do all of that. You don’t have to be a starving artist. You don’t have to go work in boring banking. It’s really exciting and really lucrative at the same time.”
While tech recruiting at Harvard is not nearly as developed as it is at MIT, SEAS and the Office of Career Services are working to close the gap. Keith Karasek, the SEAS Director of Experiential and Career Development, works to facilitate recruiting for SEAS majors in a school that he says has traditionally  focused more on finance and consulting recruiting.
The OCS’s two main CS-related career fairs are the Big Data and Analytics Fair in the fall (with 77 participating companies in 2015) and the Start-up Career Fair second semester. While both fairs are much more limited in scope than MIT’s, SEAS can also send a select number of its students to participate in MIT’s on-campus interview program, which is more tech-heavy than Harvard’s. 
Much of the recruiting and negotiation advice at Harvard exists outside the classroom. Stoica found her tech internships at Groupon last summer and Goldman Sachs this summer through a Grace Hopper Conference, a series of conferences for women in computing. Email lists, both formal—like Women in Computer Science and the Harvard Computer Society’s—and informal, are also tools to find jobs or internships and negotiate pay offers.
Tech talks, also frequently publicized over email lists, are another avenue for students and recruiters to find one another. While CS51 does not have a formal sponsorship arrangement with quantitative trading firm Jane Street (which works in OCaml, the obscure programming language taught in CS51), representatives of the company come to Cambridge every year to deliver a lecture and host a tech talk, distributing pizza and free t-shirts on the trip. Other companies, like Facebook and Dropbox, have delivered tech talks on campus too.
The tech industry’s penchant for free, branded merchandise has permeated MIT as well, as one quick walk around campus confirms.
“If you see someone wearing an MIT t-shirt, chances are they’re a tourist, and if they’re wearing a Dropbox t-shirt, chances are they’re an MIT student,” says Goemans.
“Open. Connected. Active. Transparent. Livable. Sunlit. Social. Flexible,” read the first words of a Jan. 2013 document detailing ideas for SEAS’s new Allston campus. “These words keep coming up when SEAS faculty talk about the exciting possibilities of a new Harvard campus in Allston.”
The same words also do a decent job of describing Course 6’s home at MIT, the Stata Center. At lunchtime on weekdays, it’s rare to find an empty table in the building’s lobby, and lines extend out of the café and coffee shop. The hum of conversation and the click-clacking of keyboards bounce off  the high, irregularly shaped ceiling.

In contrast, Maxwell-Dworkin, Harvard CS’s home, is decidedly cramped and unsociable. During shopping week, it was not uncommon for classes to spill out of their assigned classrooms, ultimately abandoning them altogether in favor of empty common spaces.
“We’ve set up a few tables in the ground floor at Maxwell-Dworkin. It’s not great, not very inviting. No food. No coffee,” says Lewis. “It’s not as homey as I wish it would be and I think it’ll feel homey over [in Allston], and that will be good.”
While MIT’s community spaces may be “homier,” both schools are extremely pressed for office space. They face similar problems: While student interest is growing at a steady clip, faculty hires are limited by both availability and physical space. who’s available and whether there’s physically room for them.
Devadas says that Course 6 is “in a serious space crunch,” a problem which started shortly after it moved into the Stata Center in 2004. Before Course 6 can make new hires, it has to submit a “space plan” to the Dean of the School of Engineering, proving that the new hires will have a place to work.
While there is certainly an end in sight for Harvard’s space concerns, not everyone shares Lewis’ optimism about the Allston campus.
“I think it will be terrible,” says Reimers, a resident of Pforzheimer House. “I’m curious to see how Harvard does it. I have not been impressed with how they’ve done distance before... To me, it seems like a high-level bureaucratic decision being passed down with some regard, but not as much as should be given, to how it will affect the students.”
Reimers worries that shuttle schedules will not be able to accommodate the irregular hours of college students. “You’ll probably find CS students in classrooms at like 4 a.m. And if you don’t have a shuttle running, then that’s a problem,” he says.
While much remains uncertain about the Allston move, some things are for sure: There will be an engineering campus in Allston, and the computer science department will move there.
In a way, this isn’t too different from Eliot’s plan. When he was attempting to absorb MIT in 1905, his plan was to move it across the river to Allston, on roughly the same land that Harvard Athletics occupies now and that the SEAS campus will occupy in 2020. For Eliot, the Allston campus was a chance for Harvard to separate the engineers from the scholars. He promoted the very “socially isolating” split that Reimers fears.
But this time around, the goal isn’t a rigidly divided Harvard Institute of Technology. Rather, as Harvard’s current president wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times, the College’s professed aim is to mould “scientifically sophisticated humanists and humanistically grounded scientists and engineers.”
Graduate School of Education Professor Howard E. Gardner ’65 agrees, though he’s still wary of “a slippery slope toward becoming, in effect, a school of professional or pre-professional training.”
In an email, Gardner described a national study of higher education he’s conducting, writing “A student at that school said ‘I am getting a liberal arts education AND an engineering degree.’  I hope that is what Harvard undergraduates will aspire to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 18, 2016, at 2:15 a.m.
A recent Harvard College graduate filed a lawsuit against Harvard University, charging that College and University administrators mishandled a response to her sexual harassment case and allowed an alleged perpetrator to live in Cabot House with her.
The federal suit—which was filed in Massachusetts District Court on Tuesday—charts a sexual harassment complaint Alyssa R. Leader ’15 filed with Harvard in 2015 against a male College student after what the suit describes as repeated threatening and abusive sexual encounters. The suit alleges that the student, referred to as “John Doe 1,” sexually abused Leader during a “dating relationship” and then subsequently intimidated and harassed her in Cabot House after the relationship ended.
Requesting punitive damages for Harvard and compensation, Leader alleges in the lawsuit that Harvard administrators failed to follow federal guidance on university sexual harassment investigations. In particular, the suit argues that Harvard’s handling of the case violated anti-sex discrimination law Title IX and failed to protect her against retaliation. 
“The acts and failures to act perpetrated against Plaintiff amounted to unlawful sexual harassment and discrimination on the basis of gender,” the suit charges against the University. “Defendants acted with deliberate indifference in deviating significantly from the standard of care outlined by the [Department of Education].”
In an emailed statement, Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that Harvard does not comment on pending litigation.
After Leader reported sexual harassment to several administrators, who later opened a formal investigation, she requested that they remove Doe from Cabot during the course of the investigation. According to the suit, administrators did not remove Doe from Cabot until Leader had secured a restraining order from an outside court.
Alex S. Zalkin, the California attorney representing Leader, said he and Leader first began working on filing the suit about a month ago. Leader reached out to Zalkin, who works at a firm that specializes in sexual abuse law, he said.
The suit traces several interactions Leader said she had with University administrators regarding sexual harassment over the course of about two years. According to the suit, Leader first reported Doe’s conduct to Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response in spring 2013, and again in September 2014. On Nov. 6, 2014, the suit states, Leader met with Cabot Resident Dean Tiffanie L. Ting and claimed that Doe had sexually harassed her in Cabot dining hall and cafe, among other places. The suit alleges that Ting discouraged Leader from filing a formal complaint and said Doe could not be moved from Cabot. Ting could not be reached for comment.
“I think that the biggest takeaway from the complaint is that she recorded multiple times not only that she was sexually assaulted, but that there was retaliatory and ongoing harassment from the perpetrator and his friends,” Zalkin said. “Notwithstanding, Harvard did nothing to protect her and make her feel safe on campus, which is basically the whole purpose of Title IX.”
In an emailed statement, Rakesh Khurana, the Dean of the College and a Cabot House master, wrote that he could not comment on pending litigation. Still, he wrote that Harvard administrators “take seriously and swiftly respond to all allegations of sexual assault and harassment.”
“My colleagues and I in the College will continue our efforts to educate our community about the issue of sexual assault, to better prevent it, and to provide the best resources for those who experience it,” he wrote.
Leader reported Doe to the Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution in February 2015, prompting a formal investigation, and updated ODR investigators on Doe’s alleged retaliatory conduct—including threatening comments and increased presence at Leader’s workplace, Cabot Cafe—according to the suit. She also reported sexual assault to the Harvard University Police Department in April.
The suit claims that, on advice from Miller, the College’s Title IX coordinator, ODR, and OSAPR, Leader did not try to secure contact restrictions that could have prevented alleged retaliation against the plaintiff. It also alleges that the defendants—listed as the Harvard Corporation and Board of Overseers—did not provide Leader with adequate information about her legal rights, including her option to pursue a restraining order. When Leader independently obtained a restraining order against Doe on April 27, 2015, College administrators moved Doe to another residential building, according to the suit.
After both Leader and Doe graduated in 2015, the ODR found Doe “Not Responsible” on all claims of rape, assault, abuse, and retaliation; Leader unsuccessfully appealed the finding, according to the suit. The College's Administrative Board then reviewed the results of the investigation, and voted for a sanction of “Scratch,” a ruling that indicates no wrongdoing had occurred.

Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said Leader has the full support of the group and called the suit “really tragic and horrifying, but certainly not unique.”
“I think Harvard would like to believe and would like to tell the community at large that these issues have been solved, so they've created a new policy and had all these task forces,” she said. “I think that Alyssa's case points very clearly to the fact that that is not true; this is still ongoing; this is still systemic.”
Zalkin, one of Leader’s lawyers, said his team held a press conference on Wednesday at the Sheraton Commander Hotel and anticipates heavy press attention to the case given recent criticisms of Harvard’s handling of sexual assault.
A federal investigation into Harvard College’s compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX remains ongoing. In July 2014, Harvard unveiled a new approach for handling cases of alleged sexual harassment, creating a centralized, investigatory office. And in December 2014, the federal government found Harvard Law School in violation of Title IX.

A proposed dual degree program between the Music Department and the Berklee College of Music has some faculty members facing the music about the hidden costs associated with niche academic opportunities.
The proposal mirrors a partnership already in place between Harvard and the New England Conservatory.
Over the course of five years, students currently enrolled in the Harvard-NEC program receive a Bachelor of Arts from the College and a Master of Music from the conservatory. The Harvard-Berklee program similarly would allow students to receive a dual degree in fields including music technology, digital production, global music, and jazz performance, according to Music professor Ingrid Monson.
“We think it’s a terrific option for students to have,” Monson said. “It adds a new range in possibilities for our students to take advantage of.”
The Harvard-Berklee program would cost each student $8,000 per year, the same cost of the current Harvard-NEC program after which it is modeled, according to Music Department Chair Carol J. Oja.
The Harvard-Berklee program’s global jazz track, however, would be fully funded, whether the enrolled student is at Harvard or another school, Oja added.
Although the Faculty Council passed the proposal at a meeting last month, several council members disagreed with the vote, citing the program’s student-musician costs that financial aid would not cover.
Psychology professor Jason P. Mitchell, a member of the Faculty Council—which is the highest elected body in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—voted against the program and also voiced his concerns at a general FAS meeting earlier this month.
The partnership would preclude underprivileged students from participating, an outcome not in line with Harvard’s mission of opening doors for students regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds, Mitchell said.
“It seems to us as though it’s walking back from that commitment to now create new programs that will effectively be only open to students with the financial means to pay for them,” he said.
But Monson said other FAS programs, including summer school and study abroad opportunities, require students to pay supplementary fees that financial aid does not cover.
“The thing is, programs like this—where there are hidden costs—are not unusual at Harvard,” she said. “To tie the creation of the program to this University-wide issue, which really is not under discretion of the Music Department, is not fair,” she added.
Oja said costs associated with students’ courses of study are not new to music programs and also have not prevented a wide variety of students from participating.
“Students, unfortunately, are in a position to pay for a lot of extras, especially music students,” Oja said. “Music students, if they’re going to study with a teacher at Harvard... if they’re going to study privately, they pay for those lessons privately.”
To address the question of student costs, faculty members at Harvard and Berklee are already discussing additional fundraising opportunities for the proposed program.
Monson said professors from the Music Department and from Berklee may make presentations to people who might be interested in supporting the program financially.
“It’s very likely there will be fundraising through Berklee to help out with paying for this,” Oja said.
Regardless of these efforts, however, Oja said that her colleagues should evaluate the approval of the program independently of its costs, especially since it allows undergraduates ultimately to obtain a Master’s degree.
“This is a Master’s degree, so it’s sort of separate in many ways in thinking about the costs of an undergraduate education, because these are all costs that are ultimately targeted to a graduate degree, which is not what Harvard College does,” Oja said.

The Undergraduate Council and the Advising Programs Office will present their respective advising awards in a single ceremony for the first time this spring. The move follows a consolidation of the nomination process for the two sets of awards.
The prizes recognize exemplary work of academic advisers, concentration advisers, peer advising fellows, and other faculty mentors. The nominations for both sets of awards were due on Thursday. The APO will now select a winner for the Star advising award and the UC’s Education Committee will choose winners for the Levenson, Marquand, and Dingman awards.
“We’re making the process more efficient, but really with the goal of bringing more saliently to the attention of the community the issue of outstanding advising and the virtue as we see it of celebrating it,” Director of Advising Programs Glenn R. Magid said of the move to consolidate the nominating process and awards ceremony for the four prizes.
UC leaders, who publicized the awards extensively over Harvard email lists, said the advising awards were an important way for students to single out outstanding mentors.
“The idea behind the awards is that we have a lot of really hard working teaching fellows, advisers, professors, that take their time out of their day to advise their students and who often don’t get recognized,” Evan M. Bonsall ’19, a member of the UC Education Committee, said.
UC Education Committee chair Scott Ely ’18 said his committee would look at a variety of factors in choosing winners for its three awards, but that chief among them would be “time, commitment, and aptitude.”
Since nominations come from students, Magid said, students are free to judge for themselves what qualities in advisers are worth recognizing. For his part, Magid said he thought good advising most required an active interest in the lives of students.
“Good advising begins with a real dedication to the mission,” Magid said. “It requires a certain set of skills: listening skills, speaking skills, a comfort with the unknown, a willingness to seek out information when you don’t have all of the answers, solid judgment, a real sensitivity to who the person is.”
Other students identified a range of qualities they saw as being necessary for a good adviser, but one common theme among them was approachability.
Elise N. Laird ’19, whose academic adviser is also her proctor, said the availability of her adviser was something she appreciated.
“He’s always available, which is helpful with day to day questions, especially at the start of the semester,” Laird said of her adviser. “I think it’s not really helpful to have an adviser if you have a question and it takes them multiple days to get back to you, especially if you need to make quick decisions.”
Other students mentioned strong support for students’ academic choices as a key quality in good advisers.
“I think he’s a good adviser because whenever I make a decision he supports it, even though he does warn me,” Lisa L. Vo ’19 said of her adviser. “He’ll give me the truth about it and he’ll support me either way.”

UPDATED: February 18, 2016, at 11:15 a.m.
The annual Cultural Rhythms Festival has expanded its programming to include a dialogue series and other events in an effort to connect the performance showcase to race-related conversations happening on campus and across the country.
For 31 years, the Harvard Foundation has organized the Cultural Rhythms Festival as a way to highlight diversity on campus. In past years, the festival has included a luncheon and performance featuring a guest speaker and a multicultural food festival. 
This year, however, the Foundation organized a series of discussions throughout the week, which will culminate in a town hall meeting with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on Sunday. Foundation interns made the programming changes in response to recent race-related discussions and student activism on campus.
“We didn’t feel comfortable celebrating diversity without engaging in these deeper conversations or engaging with the actual issues that this term diversity and the diverse experience of Harvard students have as they’re existing on campus,” Cultural Rhythms co-organizer Avni Nahar ’17 said.
Nahar, an inactive Crimson Blog editor, is one in a team of students working at the Foundation to coordinate programming that focuses on race and intercultural relations throughout the year. Co-organizer Jonathan A. Sands ’17 said the current interns hoped to update Cultural Rhythms so that it is more relevant to students.
“It’s our mission as leaders to preserve the Harvard Foundation’s traditions and legacy of promoting intercultural and race relations at Harvard while also ensuring that we keep top of mind what the current challenges are on our campus,” he said.
The House master naming debate was a main topic of discussion of an event focused on free speech and intercultural relations on Wednesday.
“The free speech conversation, I think, became super salient with all the campus activism of last semester and continued campus activism over the last few years,” Nahar said.
The dialogue series, which kicked off Monday, has also featured a discussion on ethnic studies, an increasingly relevant topic given the recent development of curricula and working groups focused on broadening Latino and Asian American studies on campus.
Nuha Saho ’18, a coordinator for the dialogue series, said he hopes the combination of the typically popular performance with the new discussion events will attract larger and more diverse audiences.
“We thought that this week of Cultural Rhythms would for some people turn it from a superficial show into an actual, sustained and critical dialogue that we wanted to use to engage people on the campus who do not usually participate,” he said.
While interns and Khurana have previously discussed hosting more Cultural Rhythms events, this was the first year that the funds and interns were available to coordinate additional programs, according to Nahar. The Undergraduate Council’s help organizing the food festival allowed resources to go towards planning the additional events. There will also only be one show because of a decline in cultural performance groups, according to Nahar.
Remaining events include a discussion Thursday centered on race and the 2016 presidential election and an event exploring identity and performance Friday. Saturday’s Cultural Rhythms show in Sander’s Theater will feature actress Lucy Liu as the 2016 Artist of the Year, as well as many student performance groups.

Health experts discussed difficulties in identifying the Zika virus and emphasized international collaboration to combat its outbreak in front of a large crowd at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Wednesday.
The Zika virus, whose first confirmed human case of infection was in 1952, according to the World Health Organization, has recently returned to the public spotlight following a rise in recent outbreaks. Since 2007, the virus has cropped up at increasing rates in new regions such as the Pacific and South America. The virus is transmitted by day-biting mosquitoes as well as through sexual transmission.
Moderated by Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Sheila Burke, the panel explored ways to contain and prevent the spread of the virus.
Speakers referenced the haphazard international response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak as a cautionary tale for future global health epidemics.
“Following the outbreak of Ebola and the widely held view that we were ill-prepared, an effort was made to develop a framework for the management of such crises. Today, the [World Health Organization] published a six month plan to coordinate a multinational response to the spread of Zika, illustrating lessons that were learned from Ebola,” Burke said.
Michael J. VanRooyen, head of the emergency medicine department at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, added the United States healthcare system is not yet prepared to contain Zika in a timely manner.
VanRooyen’s recent experience attempting to obtain a Zika test illustrated the lack of an infrastructure for Zika virus prevention.
“Today I was working over at the Brigham ER, so I decided to get a Zika test to figure out if I could get tested. I was informed that I first had to make an appointment with the [Obstetrics] department first, as they are the ones who actually have to order it. Then I had to sit down with a counsel to discuss it, as well as send a urine sample to a reference lab to get tested, which would take about three and a half weeks to get back to me,” VanRooyen said.
“So by the time I got the appointment, I got the test, it was going to be about a month and a half before I would find out,” VanRooyen added.
VanRooyen was joined at the event by Helen Branswell, a senior global health writer for STAT, and Howard A. Zucker, New York State’s health commissioner and a former Assistant Director-General of the WHO.
The panelists agreed that increased intergovernmental collaboration provides the best solution to containing the virus.

Jill E. Abramson ’76, the former executive editor of The New York Times and lecturer in the English Department, lamented the lack of in-depth investigative reporting this election cycle in front of a packed roundtable at the Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday.
The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy at the Kennedy School brought the veteran journalist to speak as part of a three-part speaker series on the state of election coverage.
“I just am frustrated because I think accountability journalism, that holds the government accountable, is why the Constitution made the First Amendment first,” Abramson said. “Journalists have a very protected place in our society, and giving the highest quality information to the voters is the most important thing we do every four years.”
Abramson said when she tried to find exemplary profiles of this year’s candidates for her journalism class—English Cijr: "Introduction to Journalism"—to study, she was unable to find any articles she deemed satisfactory on Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, and struggled to find one on Republican Donald J. Trump.
“I heard that the Times and some of the broadcast networks didn’t have a full-time reporter assigned to Trump until recently, which is shocking,” she said.
The self-professed ‘political junkie’ attributed the lack of quality campaign coverage to a shift in media focus towards short-term reporting projects that attract page views.
“Newsrooms have been cut and nobody wants to get deep enough in the days' stories,” she said. “Reporters don’t have the time to do the kind of pieces that I love. Things like investigative reporting are the most expensive kind of reporting.”
The Times’ first female executive editor also discussed the potential of internet-driven media sources, like Buzzfeed, to drive the future of longform journalism.
“Buzzfeed isn’t just covering the moment,” she said. “They have a 14-person investigative unit with editors and reporters. That’s actually bigger than what I had at my disposal as executive editor of the Times. They’re going places that others don’t.”
Going forward, Abramson recommended focusing coverage on the big picture when reporting during election cycles.
“I loved [reporting] with the approach the Wall Street Journal really taught me, which was not to focus on up-to-the-second breaking news and little developments inside the campaign meant really for an audience of insiders,” she said. “Really go out and understand yourself, by listening to people, what the election was really about.”

The University's information center has unveiled a new mobile tour application, in partnership with the founders of Harvard Innovation Lab’s startup PIVOTtheWorld, which allows users to view campus landmarks through a new interactive and historical lens.
The new app allows users to pivot their phone’s camera towards a building on Harvard’s campus and gain access to pictures of the site from as early as the late 1800’s, as well as historical context on the building.
PIVOT was founded by Kennedy School alumna Asma S. Jaber and her husband Sami Jitan. The idea for the app sprung from Jaber’s desire to connect with her parent’s Palestinian history.
“I wanted a way, after my father passed away, to be able to capture and share this history to a wider audience, especially those at a risk of being lost.” Jaber said.
Jaber and Jitan then took the idea to the Harvard Innovation Lab where they won the Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge in 2014. In doing so, they received $25,000 to further develop their startup.
Originally, the app was focused on providing information about locations all over the world. But soon after winning the challenge, the pair got in contact with Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, according to Jaber.
“We conversed with them about a possible mobile app and how they wanted to engage users with Harvard’s history,” Jaber said.
Through the app, users can also listen to an audio recording giving historical context on a site about which they are interested in learning more. With 24/7 availability, the app allows tourists to explore campus outside of normal tour hours, according to Jitan.
“The problem we saw with Harvard was that students who work as tour guides for the information center have lives outside of their work, and during those times no one is there to given the official Harvard tour,” Jitan said. “We are hoping that this will serve as a surrogate tour guide and eventually a companion of tours at Harvard.”
Students like Charles A. Scherr ’17, who serves as the Crimson Key Society Guidebook and Marketing Manager, reiterated the importance of having more accessible tours.
“Harvard’s history is incredibly unique,” Scherr said. “The more people who can access a tour of the Yard, the better.”
Jaber and Jitan recognize the need to get Harvard students involved in their app. The duo is currently in talks with the Harvard Computer Society to hear students’ input on the mobile tour app.
“HCS is currently working to collaborate with PIVOT on a series of events that give our members the experience of working in a startup and give PIVOT a new perspective on their app,” said Abdulrahman Jamjoom ’19, Director of Internal Relations for HCS.

The College's House masters have recommended potential replacement titles and said they are waiting on final administrative approval, more than two months after they unanimously agreed on a change.
In December, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that the House masters would change their title, which some have associated with slavery. In his email notifying undergraduates of the change, Khurana wrote a replacement title would be chosen by “early 2016.” 

College Spokesperson Rachael Dane indicated that Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith will make the final decision on the name change. Smith could not be reached for comment.
Diana L. Eck, a co-master of Lowell House, said House masters have not yet heard about a final decision.
“Every day I open my email and wonder if this is the day we figure out who we are,” she said.
The list of recommendations were the result of discussion among House masters, Adams House co-master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said.
“The House masters have talked about it, and made some recommendations. It’s now in the hands of the University to decide, whether they decide on any of our suggestions or not,” he said.
While it is unclear what names may be on the list, Palfrey previously said he found potential titles such as “leader” boring, while others like “magister” or “rector” are archaic.
Top Harvard leaders including Smith, University President Drew G. Faust, and Khurana have all said they support the planned modification. Khurana, a House master himself, said he was uncomfortable with the title several days before he sent the College-wide email signed by all 24 House masters announcing the impending changes.
Discussions to change the House master title took off amid a period of heightened racial activism and protests on campuses nationwide.
Some students have criticized the name, saying the title bears associations with slavery. A group of Latino students submitted a list of demands to Faust in November aimed at improving the College experience for students of color, with the House master title change among them.
The impending House master name change is not unique to Harvard. Colleges across the country, including Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, are also planning to change their equivalent title.
MIT administrators are currently engaged in similar conversations. Last month, MIT house masters also unanimously voted to request to change their title of “Housemaster.” According to John M. Essigmann, one of MIT’s more than 25 housemasters, House administrators have settled on two alternatives: House Dean and Head of House.
MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart must approve the proposal before administrators can change the title, according to Essigmann.

In an effort to change the way snow is removed on campus, students from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences collaborated with Facilities Maintenance Operations to engineer solutions, including a robotic snow blower, icicle removal tool, and snow-melting mat.
The 18 students who worked on the projects all enrolled in the fall junior tutorial, Engineering Sciences 96: “Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project,” which gives students the ability to solve the real-world problems of specifically selected clients.
“The idea of this class is that it mimics real life situations and real working situations for engineers,” course instructor David J. Mooney, professor of bioengineering, said.
Students in the course work with a different client each semester. Following last winter’s record-breaking snowfall, snow-removal surfaced as a possible design project, according to Mooney. Given their role in removing snow on campus, Mooney approached FMO as possible clients.
Following a presentation by representatives from FMO, the students began identifying the three most promising challenges they could address over the semester, eventually deciding on icicle removal, snow-blowing, and snow-melting.
Currently, workers must climb on rooftops to knock down potentially dangerous icicles. The new icicle removal prototype consists of a wire that can heat up to extremely high temperatures in a short amount of time, attached to a pole, to sharply remove icicles from rooftops while allowing workers to remain on the ground.
“If we could keep people off of the roofs with the icicle cutter, that’s a safety factor and it’s less strainful [than being] strapped up there and tied in,” Friedman said.
Several students praised the hands-on nature of the course and the ability to directly apply their designs to issues facing the Harvard community. Throughout the semester, feedback on design was solicited from Facilities Maintenance Operations.
“They got some very important feedback and it helped them hone in,” Mooney said.
At the end of the semester, students displayed their prototypes in presentation to representatives from FMO.
“We saw great potential in all three projects and we would be excited to pilot them in the future,” said Jeffrey L. Smith, Director of Facilities Maintenance Operations.

In the wake of the ground-breaking discovery of gravity waves last week, students, professors, and researchers at Harvard have been preparing to work in a field that is now drastically changed.
After the announcement of the discovery, a team of researchers in Harvard’s Astronomy Department has since published a report detailing a follow-up experiment they conducted using a telescope located in Chile.
Edo Berger, a professor of Astronomy and the head of the research team, said his interest “has to do with finding counterparts to the gravitational wave sources using traditional telescopes.”
According to Berger, when events that cause gravity waves occur, counterparts to gravity waves—which can manifest in anything from electromagnetic waves to radiation—may also take place. Berger said detecting these counterpart emissions would expand the understanding of the origin of these releases.
“We can gain from this a much more precise understanding of when the event actually happened, so we can tell specifically which galaxy it came from and where inside the galaxy it happened,” Berger said. “Traditional wave data gives us some details about distance, but not as much.”
In this instance, gravity waves were emitted from the collision of a binary system of black holes. Einstein hypothesized that these waves were ripples in the very fabric of space-time.
Michael W. Coughlin—another member of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory discovery team that uncovered the gravity waves—said experiments to detect gravitational waves were conducted with telescopes aimed in the general direction that seemed promising for detecting such waves, as deemed by the team.
Philip S. Cowperthwaite, a graduate student and member of Berger’s team, said this method is a “very big observational challenge because the region that LIGO tells us this source is coming from is very large.”
Narrowing down this region might come down to engineering a more precise telescope, Berger said, but the discovery of gravity waves is nonetheless a major breakthrough in available methods of research.
“For us as astronomers, it's really fascinating  because we’ve been using essentially the same techniques to study the universe for the past 100 years,” Berger said. “This is essentially a whole new way to study the universe that became available to us a week ago.”
Students at the College are equally as fascinated with the discovery. Coughlin, who is also a teaching fellow for PS12A:  “Mechanics from an Analytical, Numerical and Experimental Perspective” said at least 10 students have approached him to discuss the study since it was publicized last week. Other students at the College interested in physics have been following the news as well.
“It’s always a great experience to have something like a big discovery happen in your lifetime, and we’ve had it twice with the Higgs Boson discovery and now the gravity waves,” Quentin E. Neroes ’19  said.
Coughlin said he believed this discovery could have ramifications for Harvard’s relationship with LIGO. Currently, Harvard is not an official member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration group that includes over 80 partner universities. Coughlin said he believed it is unlikely that Harvard will seek affiliation with LIGO, but that there is a possibility the discovery might encourage Harvard’s Astronomy Department to employ LIGO-affiliated postdoctoral fellows to pursue further research on the topic.

CS50, one of the largest courses at the College, is adding high school education to its sizeable portfolio of computer science course offerings. The new arm of the course, dubbed “CS50 AP” and supported heavily by Microsoft, is currently being piloted in more than 40 high schools across the nation.
CS50 AP will satisfy the College Board’s soon-to-launch AP Computer Science Principles curriculum. Harvard’s CS50 staff is also providing teachers in the pilot program with curriculum support, supplementary course materials, and regular course updates through a “CS50 AP” wiki in addition to the lectures, which are already available through the online education platform edX. 
Harvard isn’t the only university getting involved in the AP CS Principles curriculum, which will be offered alongside the already-existing AP Computer Science A. The University of California at Berkeley, Trinity University, and the University of Texas at Austin have all developed and released similar programs and are all expected to receive official endorsement from the College Board, according to the College Board’s website. CS50 Course Head David J. Malan ’99 wrote in an email that he had spoken with the College Board within the past week, though he did not respond to requests for elaboration.
Microsoft, one of CS50’s 16 listed corporate sponsors, is helping spearhead the CS50 AP program. One of the two “CS50 AP Bootcamps” held this summer for high school teachers took place at Microsoft's offices in Redmond, Wa., and Microsoft has provided prospective CS50 AP teachers with scholarships enabling them to take CS50 through the Harvard Extension School before bringing CS50 AP to high school classrooms.
It also appears that Microsoft was involved in developing the CS50 AP curriculum itself. The first CS50 AP update notified teachers that Microsoft senior content manager Natasha Chornesky had assigned two Microsoft interns to start drafting Units 2 and 3 of the course curriculum.
While Malan declined to disclose the amount of money Microsoft had committed to the high school program, Saber Khan, the director of education technology at The Browning School and a teacher in the pilot program, said Microsoft has provided “tons of help.” Though Microsoft was heavily involved, Khan said he never felt that the company’s products were being “pushed” on participants.
Chornesky declined requests to provide comment on the phone and did not respond to emailed questions by press time.
Microsoft also supported a recent CS50 AP Hackathon held at the The Browning School in New York. The impetus for the idea came from Khan, who “pitched the idea” to Chornesky. According to Khan, Microsoft provided much of the logistical support, such as catering and other event planning efforts, for the hackathon.
At the hackathon, which more than 100 high school students attended, Malan and other members of the CS50 production team provided in-person problem set walkthroughs and answered students’ questions.
“Actually getting to talk to [former CS50 TF Zamyla Chan ’14], and actually getting to talk to David Malan was really interesting,” Terrell Edwards, a junior at Browning, said. “It’s a different point of view from watching the videos.”
CS50 AP is being adapted differently at high schools across the country. At some schools, such as Browning and Greenwich High School in Connecticut, elements of the CS50 AP curriculum have been incorporated into existing classes. At others, such as the Cincinnati Country Day School, CS50 AP is being offered as an entire course, according to computer science teacher Marcus Twyford.
Since Malan took over CS50 in 2007, the course has grown immensely both in undergraduate enrollment and scope. CS50 boasts a large following on edX, as well as satellite operations at Yale University, where it was the most enrolled course this past fall. CS50 has also drawn controversy for its corporate sponsorships and what appears to have been a trademark dispute between Malan and Harvard for the course’s title.
According to Khan, the Harvard brand and Malan’s pedagogy “complement each other really well.” The Harvard name, Khan said, was likely important for getting the head of Browning to approve hosting the CS50 AP Hackathon.
Twyford said that while the Harvard brand acts as a “stamp of approval,” the real credit for the course’s success goes to Malan.
“It was all [Malan],” Twyford said. “You watch the lectures, whether live or vocal, and he really brings the energy. Yes there’s a nice production value to it that I’m a little envious of... there’s an energy and insight and a real approachability that says ‘you can do this.’”
Both Khan and Twyford were familiar with Malan and CS50 from their own enrollment in CS50x on the edX platform before CS50 AP launched.
Doug R. Lloyd ’09, a CS50 preceptor, said there are already plans to expand CS50 AP. In addition to current instructor bootcamps being held in Cambridge and Washington D.C., the program plans to launch two more workshops in San Diego and London soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard spent about $540,000 lobbying the federal government for increased research funding, financial aid simplification, and immigration reform in 2015, maintaining a pace set in previous years.
According to public records filed with Congress, Harvard lobbied the White House, both chambers of Congress, and the Department of Education last year on a range of bills including the DREAM Act, which would outline a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and the 2016 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. Harvard primarily works with members of Congress who are alumni, members of the Massachusetts delegation, and the relevant committee chairs on pieces of legislation concerning University interests.
The records also indicate that Harvard has lobbied on legislation regarding student financial aid, specifically addressing Pell Grant funding and Stafford and Perkins loans, and issues related to tax reform and university endowments.
Harvard’s lobbying expenditures peaked at $1,170,000 in 2007, when the Higher Education Act was considered for reauthorization, but have been consistently around half a million dollars since 2011.
$120,000 of Harvard’s total lobbying expenditures was paid to O’Neill, Athy, and Casey, a relatively small law firm in Washington, D.C. that specializes in lobbying Capitol Hill. Harvard’s lobbying budget also includes salary costs for Harvard employees involved with lobbying efforts, paid dues to educational and research consortiums that lobby on Harvard’s behalf, and maintaining overhead costs. Harvard does not solely rely on employees or lawyers to lobby D.C.; University President Drew G. Faust has also made several trips to hobnob with government representatives, most recently in October when she traveled to Washington to promote climate research.
"Harvard and the federal government have a long standing partnership that involves research funding, student financial aid, tax related issues, and a range of other issues that require us to have an ongoing interaction to be able to inform the policy making around those issues,” said Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communications. “Harvard has a small but engaged professional staff that works on behalf of the University to foster those conversations.”
Harvard’s latest lobbying efforts come as the University grapples with decreased levels of federal research funding. In the second year of wide-ranging cuts in federal spending, collectively known as sequestration, outside funding sources gave Harvard less than $800 million in 2015—the lowest figure since 2010. But in  December, Congress granted the National Institutes of Health a $2 billion funding increase, a bump that will likely flow back to Cambridge; the NIH is one of Harvard’s largest research funding sources.
Harvard spent more money on lobbying in 2015 than most of its peer institutions. Yale spent roughly $430,000, Princeton spent $240,000, and Stanford $270,000. The University of Pennsylvania was the only Ivy League school to outspend Harvard, putting about $680,000 into lobbying activities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 18, 2016, at 12:01 p.m.
A major private sponsor to Harvard Law School student organizations discontinued its funding for student events after receiving complaints about a discussion hosted by the group Justice for Palestine,  forcing the Dean of Students Office to compensate and leaving some questioning the influence of corporate donors at the school.
According to Law School administrators, in 2012, Milbank—an international corporate law firm–pledged $200,000 each year over five years to be allocated to student groups at the Dean of Students’ discretion, with the stipulation that groups publicly recognize Milbank’s contribution on their promotional materials.
The firm chose to redirect its donations from student events to other Law School initiatives after Justice for Palestine held an event on Oct. 20 titled “The Palestine Exception to Free Speech: A Movement Under Attack.”
The event—which between 80 and 100 people from across Harvard attended—invited attorneys to discuss their research on what they identify as a phenomenon of pro-Israel groups silencing Palestinian human rights activists at universities and institutions across the United States. Funds from Milbank paid for $500 worth of pizza, according to event organizers.
Organizers wrote in an op-ed in the Harvard Law Record Tuesday that in order to comply with Milbank’s funding policy, they included the firm’s name when publicizing the event. Additionally, organizers said a line on the bottom of their Facebook event page read “This event is brought to you by the good folks at Milbank LLP.” This sentence in particular triggered a back and forth with the Law School that ultimately led Milbank to discontinue funding for student events after the current installment of its gift ended.
Milbank has a strong relationship with the Law School, according to Law School spokesperson Robb London. Milbank Chairman Scott A. Edelman graduated from the Law School in 1988, and his firm partnered with the school in 2011 to establish a professional development program for its attorneys called Milbank@Harvard.
Since it was established, the firm’s student conference fund was a major sponsor of student events—until the controversy surrounding Justice for Palestine’s fall event.
In an email to Edelman two days later, pro-Israel watchdog organization  NGO Monitor called Milbank’s attention to the event and questioned the firm’s link to Justice for Palestine. In response, Milbank partner Tom Arena wrote that the firm did not endorse the views of the student group, and it had asked Justice for Palestine to remove the contentious line from its Facebook page at the Law School’s request.
In early January, student groups received emails from the Dean of Students Office notifying them that Milbank had discontinued its funding, which the school planned to replace.
“There has been a restructuring of the Dean of Students Office conference funding. There is a new fund entitled the DOS Grant Fund. This fund will replace Milbank funding,” Law School student activities coordinator Tracey-Ann Daley wrote.
In a statement affirming the Law School’s commitment to free speech and supporting student events, London wrote, “The firm has decided there are other ways its support could be used at HLS to avoid creating any misimpressions that the firm endorses the viewpoints expressed by any particular student organization or journal.”
Student groups had already completed the application process for spring Milbank funds and were beginning to plan events. The sudden restructuring of funds left the Law School responsible for replacing that sponsorship with money from other sources.
“The Law School is able to fund student conferences with other resources, and the Law School has continued to maintain the same level of funding to support student activities,” London wrote the statement.
While administrators said the overall amount of funding has remained the same, the reallocation has left some student groups with less money than before.
Several student group leaders said they were initially notified by the Dean of Students Office that they would receive fractions of the funding they had requested. Justice for Palestine members were initially allocated $500 from the DOS Grant Fund, and after petitioning for more, they received an additional $2,000. Leora A. Smith, one of the organizer’s of Harvard Human Rights Journal’s annual symposium, said they initially received $1,000 of the $7,000 Milbank gave them last year.
Representatives from Unbound: Harvard Journal of the Legal Left and LAMBDA, a BGLTQ affinity group, also said they received significantly less than they had in previous years through Milbank.
The loss of Milbank funding had particularly dramatic effects on student practice organizations, which are not eligible to receive funding from the Dean of Students Office. Advocates for Human Rights applied for $8,000 from Milbank for the spring semester, and without that funding, they will have to cancel several events, according to co-president Brian Klosterboer.
“We were pretty shocked and surprised,” Klosterboer said. “There was no explanation about what had happened and why this money went away.”
Marcia L. Sells, the Law School's dean of students, said her office is reviewing funding allocation processes to eliminate inefficiencies.
“The goals of the review are to encourage collaboration among student organizations when their proposals are similar or on related subjects;  to reduce the number of events that compete with one another for attendance; and to make certain that funds are available for a diverse variety of events,” Sells wrote in a statement. “The review is ongoing, but in the meantime, every student organization that has applied for funding this semester has received funding, as was the case last semester."
Students from several groups, though, expressed concern about funding for next year. Some student group leaders also have have questioned the extent of corporate law firms’ influence over the Law School in the wake of the Milbank incident.
In their Harvard Law Record piece, Justice for Palestine organizers highlighted the “irony” that an event discussing the suppression of speech resulted in private donors removing a critical source of funding from the group.
“I think as an organization we’re very concerned about free speech on campus, and on the role of corporate law firms in directing student speech and what kind of events we can have,” Klosterboer said. “I think it’s kind of shocking how much influence Milbank had in the first place… It just shows we have this huge influence of corporate power at the Law School.”
In their op-ed, Justice for Palestine members called on the Law School to stop accepting donations from Milbank completely. Law School spokespeople, however, said the school’s relationship with Milbank will continue.
“We have an exceptionally strong relationship with Milbank, which has acted appropriately and with the highest integrity in all respects,” London said. “We look forward to continuing that strong relationship in the future, and to discussing with Milbank how best to deploy its gift to further the Law School’s mission.”
Representatives from Milbank did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting the semester with a joint volunteer recruitment effort, both the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and the newly opened Y2Y Youth Homeless Shelter had more volunteers apply for shifts than could be accommodated.
“We saw an incredible turn out,” said Isobel W. Green ’17, administrative director of HSHS. “It shows that the student body has embraced these two shelters and made them theirs.” 
Given earlier concerns that with two shelters, there wouldn’t be enough volunteers to cover all the positions, both organizations joined together and focused on publicizing the shelters more intensely.
“We’ve done a lot of outreach, more than last year,” Green said. “We added upwards of 150 positions and we weren’t sure if the community would be able to support it.”
In response to the overwhelming interest of volunteers, both shelters are trying to accommodate those who were unable to get a position.
“We’re really trying to get people involved and we hate that we don’t have space for everyone who wants to be involved,” Anais Carell ’17,  Y2Y’s Administrative Director, said. “We’re trying to find opportunities for people who couldn’t get a regular shift to get involved with things like deep-cleans for the shelter, or other one-time, irregular things people can help out with.”
However, Green objected to using the word “surplus” to describe the situation. Despite the excess of volunteers, some shifts are still in need of volunteers.
“Surplus is a misnomer,” Green said. “People apply for specific shifts that work for them. We have a couple of overnight shifts still open.”
The process of applying to work for both Y2Y and HSHS is not one based on skills or previous experience with homeless people, but one based on availability and shift preference.
“It’s not a comp process,” Green said. “We take it based on people’s shift preferences. We believe pretty strongly in not weeding people out based on their qualifications. We think everyone has a great amount of energy and ability to contribute to service.”
The exhibited interest of volunteers proved to the shelters they both have strong community support.
“While it’s unfortunate that not everyone can get a shift, it’s really heartening that both shelters are getting all the support they need,” Carell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student organizations that receive grants this semester within the top 20 percent of the Undergraduate Council’s allocations—a figure that translates to about $1,000 per group—will be required to send a majority of their executive board members to sexual assault training.
On Wednesday, the UC’s Finance Committee passed several amendments to recent legislation that established bystander intervention training requirements for some student organizations. The Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators will lead the training sessions, which will begin after student groups are notified of the new policy, according to Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17.
The amendments set thresholds for groups that fall within the new requirements. When the committee passed the policy last week, members only specified that the training requirement would apply to “high-value” grants, and would require executive boards to meet an attendance threshold at sexual assault training sessions.
A recommendation by newly-elected Pforzheimer House representative Neel Mehta ’18 set the “high-value” threshold at the top quintile of grant-receiving organizations based on grant allocations from previous semesters. Under the rule, student organizations will be required to undergo training if they request UC funding this semester in equal or greater amounts compared to funds provided  to the top 20 percent of grant-receiving organizations last spring.
Greenlaw estimates that the threshold will hover around $1000 this semester. Of the 287 student organizations that requested UC funding last year, 58 that requested UC funding last spring received more than $1,000, including major cultural organizations, conferences, and club sports, according to Greenlaw. 
“Setting it at this amount allows us to get a very wide range of people,” Greenlaw said.
A majority of a club’s executive board will be required to attend the training, the committee decided.The committee also unanimously passed amendments that further clarified the logistics of the sexual assault training requirements. One amendment formally exempted organizations that already have strategic partnerships with OSAPR and receive sexual assault training.
“For groups that are already doing what this policy is proposing, they’re exempt,” Greenlaw said.
Another amendment, proposed by Elm Yard representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 and passed unanimously, allows students who serve as executive board members of multiple organizations to meet the training requirement just once.
“I think that what we need to do is make sure that this program is effective, but also that people don’t perceive it as a bunch of red tape,” Bonsall said.
During the meeting, the Finance Committee also separately considered establishing a loan program that would allow student organizations to borrow money from the UC to pursue for-profit projects. The Finance Committee currently allocates funds to student organizations only in the form of grants.
The group discussed fundraising events—which the Finance Committee currently does not fund—and theatrical performances as potential loan recipients.
“I want to abolish the current fundraising rule,” Greenlaw said. “But [student organizations] would have to pay a portion of it back.”
Finance Committee representatives debated how the UC would enforce the loan repayments; Greenlaw suggested that any outstanding debts could be subtracted from a group’s subsequent grant requests. The proposal is still tentative, according to Greenlaw, and representatives have yet to determine a formal policy that would specify loan repayment requirements.
The Finance Committee will continue to debate the measure over the next few weeks, Greenlaw said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In a season-defining weekend, the Harvard women’s hockey team (15-9-3, 11-6-3 ECAC) will finish its regular season play on the road as the team travels to play ECAC foes No. 10/10 Colgate (19-6-7, 11-4-5) and Cornell (11-12-4, 7-9-4).
The results this weekend will go a long way in deciding the Crimson’s–currently fifth in the ECAC standings–playoff fate. The top four teams in the ECAC at the end of the regular season obtain home ice for the conference quarterfinals and avoid playing an extra, partial octofinals series.
“Home ice is so important,” sophomore defenseman Chelsea Ziadie said. “No matter where we play we will obviously bring our best but being at home is familiar and it’s special. Playing at home is special and it’s something every team wants and it’s something we want going into the playoffs."
Harvard opens up the weekend playing against a confident Colgate team that is currently two points ahead of the Crimson in fourth place in the ECAC.
Though Harvard boasts a 14-game-winning streak against the Raiders, including a 6-2 rout at home earlier this season, Colgate comes into the clash on a three-game winning streak including a 3-2 win over ECAC leader No. 4/4 Quinnipiac, handing the Bobcats just their second loss of the season.
The Crimson will look to junior forward Sydney Daniels, the reigning ECAC Player of the Week, to get the offense going against a Raider defense allowing over two goals a game. The Southwick, Mass. native leads Harvard with 15 goals and has tallied eight in her last seven matches including a pair against Union last weekend.
The first line has been potent for the Crimson of late, tallying 17 of its last 21 points. While the starters have driven Harvard’s success, the depth of the team is still an important factor and advantage. With various changes in the lineup throughout the season, the Crimson has managed to adapt accordingly while maintaining a strong rhythm.
“We’ve had changes in the lineup all throughout the season,” Ziadie said. “We’ve had injuries, we’ve had people come in and sit out. It’s really a matter of every player not only accepting their roles but knowing their role can change any minute and fill the role that needs to be filled come game time.”
On the other end, co-captain and goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer and the Harvard blue line will look to carry their momentum from last week, when they conceded only one goal in 125 minutes of action, against a Colgate offense averaging three goals per game.
One of the biggest tasks for the blue line will be to maintain pressure on the Raiders’ attackers to make sure the opposing offense is kept at bay and shots are minimized.
“We’ve worked on getting a little bit grittier in front of our net, picking up sticks, that’s really key,” freshman defenseman Kate Hallett said. “It’s one thing to be in front of the net but it’s another thing to be in front of the net and have a stick up on one of their players.”
In its second game of the weekend, Harvard will look to ruin ECAC and Ivy League foe Cornell’s Senior Night as it takes on the Big Red at Lynah Rink.
Like Colgate, Cornell comes into the matchup on a winning streak, picking up a pair of 4-2 victories against Yale and Brown. The Crimson has a four-game winning streak against the Big Red and shut it out, 2-0, when it traveled to Cambridge earlier this season.
Statistically, Cornell comes in ranked in the bottom half of the conference on both sides of the rink. The Big Red concede an average of 2.73 goals per game while averaging just 2.44 scores, tied with the Crimson for seventh in the ECAC.
As Harvard continues its fight for home ice, Cornell’s record against teams in the top half of the conference bodes well for the Crimson. In 11 tries this season, the Big Red has only been able to claim one win, a 2-1 victory over then-No. 10/10 Princeton, against the top six teams in the ECAC.
While Harvard is confident in its ability to beat Cornell, and is arguably the favorite to come away with the result, the team will make sure not to overlook a Big Red that will likely come out with a fight on its Senior Night.
“Every single game there’s a target on your back,” Hallett said. “There’s no team in this league that you can look past, especially come playoff time, so every single team we match up [against] will get our very best, a hundred percent of the time, no matter their rankings, no matter past games, no matter our rankings, every single game is huge from here on out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team has had its fair share of hardships while competing at Princeton’s DeNunzio Pool.
Last year, the Crimson (5-2, 5-2 Ivy League) conceded to Princeton (6-2, 6-1) at this venue by a mere 21.5-point margin in the Ivy League Championships.  Most recently, at the annual H-Y-P meet hosted by Princeton, Harvard fell behind both the Tigers and the Bulldogs (10-1, 7-0). This tri-meet shattered its undefeated regular season record.
Starting on Thursday, the Crimson returns to DeNunzio to compete yet again in the Ivy League Championships in the hopes of redeeming last year’s near victory. If Harvard were able to pull off the win at this meet, the team would secure its 12th conference title in the event’s history, with the most recent victory coming in 2014.
“We’re definitely really ready to fight this weekend,” said senior captain Marlee Ehrlich.  “We want to make sure that everyone is giving their all during the entire process.”
Although last year Princeton secured first place at Ivies, Harvard is eyeing Yale as the team to present the stiffest competition this year. Not only did the Bulldogs finish its regular season with an undefeated Ivy League dual meet record, but, in doing so, Yale managed to vanquish both Princeton and Harvard at the H-Y-P meet. With the win, the Bulldogs ended a 19 year losing streak at this event.
Coming off this historic accomplishment, Yale has garnered a lot of momentum and energy for the upcoming meet, which will serve them well considering the exhaustive duration of the three-day championship. If the Bulldogs were to come away with victory, it would be the first time since 2000 that a team other than Harvard or Princeton has topped the Ancient Eight.
Nevertheless, the Crimson has been fine-tuning its training plan in recent weeks to optimize performance in order to match the other top competitors’ energies.
“We’ve been tapering, we’ve been in the weight room a little bit less, but we’ve mainly been working on speed work and technique to give our legs a bit more of a rest” said Ehrlich.
Based on individual performances during the regular season, the Crimson has a comparative advantage in the backstroke and butterfly events. At the H-Y-P meet, senior Danielle Lee won both the 100 and 200 Yard Backstroke events. Additionally, freshman Sonia Wang also put up points for the team with victories in the 200-yard Butterfly and 200-yard individual medley at this same meet.
The team will also look for strong performances from sophomore Geordie Enoch, who garnered High Point Swimmer of the Meet honors at the 2015 championship meet.
Assisting its swimming counterparts, the diving squad has also performed consistently well throughout the 2015-2016 season. Judging from its numerous first and second place finishes in the regular season meets, the diving team can be counted on as a major source of points for the team. Nevertheless, the defining factor of this branch of the team is its depth in the three-meter and one-meter events.
“All of us have had really good meets, so I think that it is possible for any of us to win,” said junior diver Elina Leiviskä.
Last year at the Ivy League Championships, Harvard failed to score in the top two places for both the one-meter and three-meter diving events. Despite this upset, many members of the team still managed to advance to the A-Finals—five and four for these events, respectively—effectively placing them in the top eight of the league for each.
In preparation for this year’s Ivy Championships, the diving squad is placing particular emphasis on maintaining composure and keeping sustained effort throughout the preliminary and final events.
“It’s very important for us to have fun and be confident and not to overthink things,” said Leiviskä. “It’s going to be a long meet, so we have to make sure to have enough energy and be ready to compete for a couple of hours.”
With the fierce level of competition among the Ancient Eight swimmers and divers, the Crimson will truly be put to the test these next few days. As the underdogs this year, the team has a lot of proving to do.
