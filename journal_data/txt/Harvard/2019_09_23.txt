After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I just wanna have enough time to change before my date,” I tell my roommate.
“What do you mean? This is a good date outfit.”
“Yea. I’m just trying to go for something a little more queer.”
I acknowledged the weight behind it as I looked down at my sundress feeling a little ashamed that my femme-phobia still seeps in occassionally no matter how much I try to push it down.
I came out as queer towards the end of my sophomore year of college after ignoring all the signs for so long. I already felt behind as most of my friends had been out for years. I finally wanted to be out and proud, but this proved difficult as I continued to be read as straight.
I remember the many times I considered cutting my hair short before realizing the only reason I would want to do that was to look less straight-passing. Then I would wonder if men would still find me attractive if I did so. I felt the invisibility as I sought more validation for my queerness, since the first thing I learned about bisexuality was its erasure.
My bisexuality felt like strike one in my queerness. Maybe I could at least make up for it by looking more queer — but what did that mean?
A year ago, I bought the black casual dress shoes I’m wearing as I write this. I remember excitedly showing my friends my new “gay shoes.” I think of the flannels I’ve added to my closet over the past few years. The tattoos and piercings I’ve added to my body to make me feel more at home in it. I’ve felt more comfortable in who I am through these forms of self-expression, but I recognize that there's also a part of me that likes it because it makes me look more stereotypically queer.
I think of the undercut I got re-done after letting the previous one grow out. I think of the chop back to my “bisexual bob” haircut after I felt my hair was getting too long.
I sought validation and felt satisfied when I got it.
This past summer, I was overjoyed to find myself in a setting with many other queer people and people of color planning on going into academia. I felt like I could find a space for myself and it brought me a sense of accomplishment to notice that I felt more settled in my queerness after having been out for over a year.
I felt a kind of membership in the BGLTQ community that I hadn’t felt the previous summer as I joined in on queer jokes and was able to reference my own experiences. I could join in even while wearing bright lipstick, winged eyeliner, and hoops. But over the following days there were more subtle reminders that I still didn’t quite fit as much as I hoped since my bi femme-ininity continued to be misread.
“Those are some really good lesbian pants!” another queer woman complimented me on my high-waisted mustard pants. She knew I was queer from a previous conversation in which I had intentionally not mentioned the men I had dated for fear of being misread as straight. But by not doing so, I was misread as a lesbian. It’s often forgotten that you might be neither.
Another reminder of my femme-ininity came over dinner the next day as we joked about starting a queer clothing line with a larger group.  Another queer woman suggested we include lots of button-downs, pants, and overalls. I noticed the butch focus as they tried to list what kind of clothes could be included in this line. I felt more excluded as I suddenly became more aware of the pink dress I was wearing.
I recognize my struggles with my own internalized femme-phobia as I think back to my “gay shoes” and other articles of clothing in my closet that I labeled as more queer in relation to the rest of my clothes — my dresses, rompers, and crop tops. In designating some articles of clothing as queer and others as not queer, we suggest it is the clothes themselves that make us queer.
While I expect to continue having my sexuality misread or seen as a phase, I now find more internal validation in my queerness so that I no longer feel like I have to dress a certain way to send a message. All my clothes are queer because they are my clothes. All my clothes are queer because I make them queer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you ever learned something so impactful that it stuck with you for years? I had one of these rare experiences during my very first semester at Harvard, when I took an existentialism course in the Philosophy department. While most of my knowledge on Kierkegaard and Sartre went out the window the moment I finished the final exam, there was one lesson that has stayed with me for the past two years: the lesson on active nihilism.
When most people hear the term “nihilist,” they might imagine a man sitting in a dark, windowless room, somberly contemplating the meaninglessness of his existence. Though nihilism can lead some people into despondency, it can also function as a path to personal fulfillment.
As a start, “nihilism” is commonly defined as “the belief that life is meaningless.” A fuller definition would further add that nihilism is the belief that life has no objective meaning. In other words, nihilists suppose that there is no single, factually-correct meaning to life that unites all of humanity. Nihilism and religion are therefore essentially incompatible, because most religions argue in favor of a universal purpose for human life, while most irreligious people are forced to admit that no such purpose could exist — the laws of physics alone cannot create “meaning.”
Because of the incommensurability of purpose and life and irreligiosity, I believe Harvard is already full of nihilists. A majority of surveyed students from every recent class have labelled themselves either “Not at all religious” or “Not very religious.” In addition, the threat of global warming is sending many young people into “climate despair” as they question how life on a dying planet could possibly have any meaning. Overall, it seems like the upcoming generation could be the most nihilistic in history.
Yet, this is not something we should necessarily fear.
You see, nihilists can be broken into two specific groups. The first are the passive nihilists. These are the individuals who, when faced with the realization that existence has no inherent meaning, can fall into a deep depression as a result. This is an act of resignation; the passive nihilist no longer sees any purpose in life, and his mental and physical condition suffer as a result. And, this is the kind of nihilism we should avoid.
However, there exists another group of nihilists: the active nihilists. An active nihilist is someone who, when confronted with the exact same realization, rejoices at the freedom that it gives her. If there were a specific meaning to human life, then each of us would be bound to follow it. But if there is not, then we all have the freedom to decide the purpose of our own lives — in fact, we are required to do so, if we wish to avoid the pit of passive nihilism. So, one active nihilist might conclude that the purpose of her life is to combat poverty across the globe. Another might commit himself to protecting the environment. Active nihilists have tremendous freedom in determining the best way to live their own lives.
Finding the meaning of your life is not easy. It requires walking a fine line between rigidity and flexibility. You don’t want to change your life’s purpose as often as you change clothes, but you also might realize that the path you were planning to follow at 18 isn’t fit for you now that you’re 28. Plus, when seeking your life’s meaning, it can be difficult to know where to start. Thus, I recommend taking time to reflect on your skills, interests, and personal ethical code. You may also find guidance in the teachings of religion, as I have.
Obviously, the concept of active nihilism is not without faults, and leads to important questions on how we can hold each other accountable for our actions if we truly believe that the meaning of life is subjective. So, I’d like to clarify that I am not saying everyone should convert to active nihilism. It’s essential for each of us to feel that our lives have a purpose, regardless of whether we do it through religion or philosophy.
I wrote this op-ed because I believe that many Harvard students (and young people more broadly) are already nihilists. If you are questioning the meaning of life as you read this, I encourage you to avoid becoming a passive nihilist. I know how bleak that state of mind can be, but you can avoid despair by following the path towards active nihilism instead. This may not be an easy adjustment, but once you’ve accomplished it, you’ll feel like your life is starting to make more sense. And, as I can attest, that’s one of the greatest feelings there is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten students recently protested one of the Harvard Lampoon’s comp meetings, condemning the undergraduate humor magazine for its insensitive content, and what they claim is a hostile and exclusive institutional culture.
As a Board, we applaud the protesters for standing up to the Lampoon. We condemn the magazine’s publication of offensive and culturally insensitive content and sympathize with the protesters’ claims that the organization has a hostile internal culture. We hope the Lampoon views the protests as impetus to work harder to build a better culture and better institutional pathways to screen their content before publication.
Last May, the Lampoon published an inappropriate, sexualized image of Holocaust victim Anne Frank, which Director of Harvard Hillel Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg compared to the “obscenity of the Nazis.” This abhorrent incident was a striking display of hypersexualization and anti-Semitism, but must be understood as only one of many instances in which the Lampoon’s actions have peddled in such morally reprehensible sentiments as humor. The magazine has — in the past — made sexist jokes, from comparing women to dogs to insensitive jokes about University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s wife. And its insensitive content extends beyond the Anne Frank image as well, including an inappropriate joke about ISIS and minorities in final clubs. As if this smorgasbord of poor taste were not harmful enough, the Lampoon has also put out content trivializing a number of delicate issues such as suicide and fat-shaming.
The editors of the Lampoon said in a statement that their publishing process “lacks sufficient editorial oversight.” We believe this lack of oversight can lead to an inability to discern what kinds of humor are in poor taste.
We sympathize with the protesters and believe the Lampoon must take steps to address their concerns. And although the Lampoon has tried to take steps toward increasing diversity and accessibility — through steps such as newly instated positions to their Accessibility Council and Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response training for new members — we believe these efforts are insufficient. The Lampoon should, in addition to OSAPR training for its members, require implicit bias training and should be more explicit about the ways their comp and internal culture have improved to avoid this in the future.
In seeking change at the Lampoon, we believe the student body has a huge amount of power. We call on students who are considering comping the Lampoon to consider the culture that has enabled the systemic production and amplification of offensive and culturally insensitive content. In so doing, we hope they either choose not to comp the Lampoon, or, in comping it, to demand change.
Change is an imperative not just for members of the Lampoon but for Harvard more broadly. As an organization with a great deal of power, not only socially on our campus, but also reputationally across the nation, the Lampoon has a responsibility to consider the ethics of all its actions. That responsibility falls especially heavily on the public face of its work — its published content.
We believe that good humor is an ethical act that can make us uncomfortable, ask us to reconsider our orthodoxies, and make light of struggles we experience in our lives, big and small. This kind of penetrating, sharp, intellectually honest humor is absolutely critical for a healthy Harvard. We hope the Lampoon agrees it’s time for a change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ArtLab, a center for artistic research and development located on Harvard’s Allston campus, hosted a kickoff celebration Saturday morning to mark the official opening of the facility.
The ArtLab has been in development for over a decade and is now finally open to Harvard affiliates and the public, according to ArtLab Director Bree Edwards. The new building will feature video and recording studios, a workshop, artist studios, and a larger multipurpose room called the “Hub.”
Edwards wrote in an emailed statement that she considers Saturday’s opening events and the ArtLab Open House held Friday afternoon a success.
“During the opening celebrations this week, we enjoyed welcoming close to 500 people from the Harvard, Cambridge, and Boston art communities to the ArtLab,” Edwards wrote. “It was a festive and inspirational few days and this is only the start to beginning.”
The grand opening featured a performance by tap dance group Subject:Matter accompanied by a live jazz band, an open rehearsal by experimental performance group Partnering Lab, and art installations by Andy Graydon. Attendees also had the opportunity to have their portrait taken by Boston-based photographer OJ Slaughter.
Ilya D. Vidrin, a visiting doctoral student and teaching fellow in Theater, Dance, and Media, leads the Partnering Lab and held a live demonstration of the lab’s work during the ArtLab’s opening celebration. Vidrin said he believes spaces like the ArtLab are integral to arts research at Harvard.
“Right now we're working with wearable technology that's quantifying particular aspects of our interaction and turning it into some form of expression,” Vidrin said about his work with the Partnering Lab. “It's an installation that invites people to really focus in on the subtleties of physical interaction that we don't really get to see.”
“Being a researcher practitioner, I think we need more spaces like this. And the fact that Harvard has a space like this really means that they're thinking about inviting dialogue and inviting engagement,” Vidrin said.
Though the ArtLab is open to both Harvard affiliates and the public, ArtLab Marketing Outreach Launch Intern Cecilia Y. Zhou ’22 said she focused on advertising Saturday’s opening events to Harvard undergraduates and making them aware of the resources available for students at the ArtLab.
“I think one of the really interesting parts of the ArtLab is the fact that we have so many different resources for so many different kinds of art creation in one facility,” Zhou said. “This kind of space really encourages interdisciplinary cross media experimentation and research in arts.”
Zhou added that the ArtLab’s multipurpose equipment and faculty involvement allow for an individualized experience tailored to every student’s needs.
“The analogy is that this is less of a gym, where you can come in and use all the equipment so much as say, a personal training facility, where professors for example, AFVS [Art, Film, and Visual Studies] or TDM [Theater, Dance, and Media] faculty might have research projects or classes here for which students can sign up.”
In addition to connecting with other facilities and professionals within the arts, Active Learning Labs Manager Rachel DeLucas in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences said she is also looking forward to “creating a mutually supportive atmosphere” between SEAS and the ArtLab.
“I'm really excited about the opportunity that we have in new Allston campus to collaborate with different parts of the institution,” DeLucas said. “Having all of those digital resources and media options to advance the kind of level at which they [the students] can communicate what they're working on is really exciting.”
Ronni Komarow, director of the gallery at the Faneuil branch of the Boston Public Library, said she hopes to see a collaboration in the future between public libraries and the ArtLab.
“One way that the art lab can contribute is by collaborating with other artists, groups that are rooted in the community,” Komarow said. “Certainly, the library branches are like the heartbeat of the community and that's a great way to start.”
Following the ArtLab’s official opening, Edwards wrote that she is looking to further advance systems within the ArtLab.
“Now that the building construction is complete, we will focus on developing the internal infrastructure for the ArtLab, including how projects and artists are identified, selected, and supported,” Edwards wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students, faculty, and Cambridge residents packed into Science Center Plaza Friday to raise awareness about climate change and call on the University to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry.
Friday’s rally coincided with climate strikes around the globe. Organizers estimate that more than four million young people took to the streets in cities including Berlin, New York, and Rio de Janeiro to urge leaders to take action on climate change.
With songs and chants, members of climate activist group Divest Harvard and the Organizers for Radical Climate Action joined students from the nearby Cambridge Rindge and Latin School to organize the rally. The groups hosted speakers including high school and University students, Harvard faculty, and Cambridge city government officials.
Divest Harvard member Ilana A. Cohen ’22 said that Divest Harvard — a group that advocates for the University to divest its endowment holdings in the fossil fuel industry — planned the rally alongside millions of others students worldwide also calling for action surrounding climate change.
“Today is the day of the global climate strike, and we view fossil fuel divestment as a baseline step in the movement for climate action and climate justice,” Cohen said. “We are a part of the greater, global, and intergenerational movement for change that we see around the world right now.”
Over the past year, Divest Harvard has ramped up its efforts to advocate for fossil fuel divestment. The group has recruited incoming freshmen, released petitions, and organized "Heat Week," a week of education about fossil fuel divestment that culminated in a rally in Harvard Yard.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has repeatedly told student activists that he would not divest the endowment, following the precedent of decades of Harvard leaders. Last week, the Harvard Management Company — the University’s financial arm — joined Climate Action 100+ to push greenhouse gas emitters to take action on climate change.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred The Crimson to previous statements regarding its position on divestment, including an article written by Bacow published last week.
“We may differ on means,” Bacow wrote. “But I believe we seek the same ends—a decarbonized future in which life on Earth can flourish for ages to come.”
Student and faculty speakers, however, said that the University must divest from fossil fuels in order to make a significant impact on climate change.
Gabrielle T. Langkilde ’21, a student from American Samoa, said Harvard’s refusal to divest threatens her home and her family’s well-being.
“By choosing to invest heavily in the fossil fuel industry, not only does Harvard show us that it does not care about its students whose families and homes are directly impacted by climate change, but it is also actively participating in the destruction and displacement of our communities,” said Langkilde, who is also a Crimson Editorial editor.
English professor Ju Yon Kim said in her remarks that she had an obligation to support divestment for the sake of her daughter.
“I have this beautiful daughter who's almost two who loves being outside, and I work at one of the most powerful institutions in the world, actually the most powerful university,” Kim said. “How can I continue to say that I support her future if this university that I work for continues to invest in fossil fuels?”
Several faculty members have joined together in recent months to protest the University’s fossil fuel investments. Their movement originally started in 2014, but was reinitiated last year with Divest Harvard’s own reinvigoration.
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern also spoke at the rally and said the City of Cambridge’s elected officials will do all they can to fight climate change.
Dozens of attendees also came from CRLS. CRLS students who chose to leave school would not receive excused absences unless they had permission from a parent or guardian, according to a statement from school administrators.
Students said that despite the potential consequences for missing school, attending the protest was worth it.
“It’s so easy for me to do that because I’m so passionate about it,” Mattingly Wood, 17, a senior at CRLS said. “I’m willing to face those consequences, and I think we need to be willing to walk out of school."
At noon, roughly half the protestors marched through Harvard Yard to the MBTA station and traveled together on the T to a larger demonstration in downtown Boston.
Between 7,000 and 10,000 people gathered at City Hall to listen to speakers, and then march to the nearby Massachusetts State House. A few hundred protesters entered the State House and filled the atrium below the office of Governor Charlie D. Baker, Jr. ’79. They chanted their demands, including that Baker declare a state climate emergency.
Cohen also spoke at the Boston climate strike, calling on strike attendees to bring those around them into the climate activism fold.
“I’m asking you to bring your friends, families, and communities into this movement because if we want to secure a more just and more stable future, then today is only the beginning,” Cohen said. “Today is only the beginning, and we need everyone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Men’s and Women’s Cross Country fell in a dual with Yale running on tired legs, but both have their eyes forward on a huge twenty-four school meet this Friday.
The Friday meet was the first race for many of Harvard’s top runners this year and was a chance for them to get up to speed before the season heats up in the coming weeks. The dual meet was only a 6k race, much shorter than the typical 8k, signaling the contest was more a warm-up for coming weeks.
The race served its purpose as of the nine man team the Crimson men ran this week, only three ran last week at Fordham. Of those, junior Blake Evertsen followed up his strong seventh place finish in Fordham with a ninth place finish against the Bulldogs, becoming the fourth scorer for the Havard squad.
Senior and 2018 Heps winner, Kieran Tuntivate, made his debut and placed third behind a pair of strong Yale sophomore runners, as they edged him by eight and three seconds respectively. The next two finishers crossed just behind Kieran as junior Mathew Pereira and freshman standout Acer Iverson placed fourth and fifth. The trio finished within two seconds of each other and will be interesting to see if they can push each other as the season progresses to new heights. Of note, the Harvard men were still without junior and third place finisher at Heps, Hugo Milner. If the Crimson can keep a cohesive pack at the top, that would greatly help their chances in the bigger meets this season.
Rounding out the scoring for Harvard was junior Micheal Alber who placed thirteenth, putting the team score at 33 points, falling short to Yale’s strong 24.
“I was happy with how the group as a whole raced on tired legs,” commented senior captain Charlie Davis on the team’s performance. “We want to be ready for the bigger races at the end of the season, which is when we’ll be at our best and racing with our full varsity squad.”
The Crimson women expected a battle against the Bulldogs and got one. In similar fashion to the men’s race, Yale took the top two spots while a trio of Havard runners, junior Anna Juul, freshman Isabell Sagar, and junior Brooke Starn took the next three. Senior co-captain Gillian Meeks finished in seventh, as the strong group of four that led Harvard to a win last week in the Fordham Fiasco, taking the top four spots, seems primed to take on the league as a pack this year.
Judy Pendergast topped out the scoring for the Crimson women finishing in ninth. This put the score at 27-28 in favor of Yale. In backbreaking fashion, Harvard’s sixth runner, junior Tessa Madrano finished one second behind Yale freshman Hannah Schupansky. As their last scorer, if Madrano could have outpaced her at the end, the score would have been even at 28-28 with Madrano finishing as the tiebreaker, flipping the meet to Harvard.
Nevertheless, the result was a great showing for the Harvard squad who were running on tired legs in the meet.
“The result actually gives us confidence because we were in a super tough training block and knew we were tired going into the race,” said Meeks on the result. “Even on tired legs the fact that we kept the end really close is encouraging for future races.”
Both teams will start off the important stretch of the season this Friday in Franklin Park for the Battle of Beantown. A fan bus leaves at 1:30 from 68 Mount Auburn Street for the 3 o’clock start.

Love It: No-Laptop Rules — Michelle C. Lara
When laptops are allowed, I know the shopping preferences of everyone around me and which emails they read and then promptly ignore. On the first day of class, the girl in front of me is already shopping for shoes while the guy seated next to her is dropping the class. Laptops are so distracting, and when you have access to an online world that steals your attention in two seconds, it becomes super easy to fall into the trap. Not only does this distract the people around you, but it also distracts you, who could learn so much more if all you had was a pen, paper, and the professor’s words (like how they used to do it in the archaic times). On top of that, laptops tempt you into writing every small thing, but not all the points a professor makes are relevant or new information. No matter the type of learner you are, this is a valuable skill for when you have to read long texts and decipher what’s important. Plus, the people behind you probably think your taste in sneakers is trash.
Hate It: No-Laptop Drools — Rocket S. Claman
I write this from my laptop, sitting in class. I have taken eleven lines of notes this lecture. I have also read all the chapter summaries for the book I was supposed to finish for class today, answered a bunch of emails, and filled out a When2meet. I answered a question posed in class so I could get my participation points. I also ate a vegan cookie from Pavement. I didn’t need a laptop to do that, but it feels important to mention. Needless to say, it’s been a very productive hour and 15 minutes.
The class is over, and yet the lecture is continuing. Classic. Anyways, here’s why no-laptop rules in classes suck.
Did you not just read how much I accomplished with my laptop in this class? I took notes, looked at the lecture slides that are posted on Canvas, basically read a whole book, put out some fires via email, and also texted this girl from my internship about becoming a detective. What can you do with a notebook? Doodle? Sneak glances at your phone? Tragic.
Confession: I typically don’t take notes on my laptop. Well, Rocket, why are you writing a “Hate It” about anti-laptop rules? Because I hate them.
Life doesn’t stop just because you’re in class. Sure, ideally everyone can pay attention for the entire class, but let’s be real, that’s not always the case. It’s much less disruptive to answer a text or an email via laptop than via phone.
You never have to print your readings, so you save money on printing.
