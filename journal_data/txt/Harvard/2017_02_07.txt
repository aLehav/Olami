Austin Mahone: You may know him as the Justin Bieber wannabe who got his start on Youtube, or as that one guy who was almost never seen without a backwards snapback or beanie.
But did I ever consider myself a #Mahomie? Maybe. Does his music still grace several of my Spotify playlists? Perhaps. Did I go to one of his concerts as a sophomore in high school and scream louder than all of the middle schoolers around me combined? Most definitely (I was in the seventh row).
Before you accuse me of being yet another crazed fangirl who will follow any baby-faced boy with swept hair, hear me out. It’s more than a superficial, physical attraction. In fact, I have a particularly interesting relationship with Austin Mahone because I am well aware of his oddities thanks to years of defending his music (and yes, I know it’s aimed at preteens).
With exaggerated dance moves and an odd assortment of gold chains, he may seem like an easy subject to roast. But is there not something endearing about the fact that he doesn’t quite realize that matching his beanie, tank top, and high tops isn’t cool, or that his snapback is a bit too big for his head? His coveted metallic jacket and generous use of flashing background lights add to his cheese factor, but they’re all part of his innocent and eager quest for love. His songs are also undeniably catchy. Repetitive, yes, but all the better excuse to know all the lyrics. Mainstream pop culture may have called his electronic beats “basic,” but they are sweetly reminiscent of early 2000s music.
But why the need to specify 2012-2014 Austin Mahone, you ask? Compare his songs from what I’d consider to be his prime—“Say Somethin’,” “What About Love,” “Say You’re Just a Friend,” and “Mmm Yeah,” to name a few—with his more recent releases. Songs like, “Dirty Work,” “Send It,” and “Put it on Me” pair with music videos that only affirm what the risque titles suggest. Lust and overconfidence have replaced innocence and novelty, and I can’t help but wonder what exactly went awry. Sometimes I feel a hopeful wave of nostalgia at the sight of his oversized snapback (albeit atop a now permed hairstyle), but it’s becoming more and more clear that channeling his inner R&B persona has taken priority. He has gone from an innocently zealous believer in love to, well, what we now see daily in pop culture.
Maybe his changed perspective on love was inevitable, and we should all accept the matured Austin. But to me, he will remain the boy unscathed by lecherous desires, and 2012-2014 Austin Mahone will always have my heart.

For Ryan Reynolds, Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 2017 Man of the Year, comedy is key. During his roast at Farkas Hall, the “Deadpool” star performed a lap dance for “Blake Deadly,” jokingly called Meryl Streep overrated, and drank straight from a bottle of maple syrup. Later in the night, he spoke about comedy’s importance.
“Comedy is everything. It’s as far back as Jack Benny, you know. It’s much farther,” Reynolds said. “It’s one of the greatest tools for social commentary on the planet.” Indeed, comedy was the actor’s best defense during his roast, when actors from the Pudding cast poked fun at him for failing to graduate college and asked him to fish a green lantern out from the bottom of a trash can (a jibe at the low rating that “Green Lantern,” in which Reynolds starred, received).
But comedy alone did not define his contribution to the night. During the roast, Reynolds was also asked to insult Tom Brady—the New England Patriots quarterback whose rumored friendship with Donald Trump has made news. “You know we’re in Boston, right?” Reynolds replied. “Tom, I'm afraid your voting skills are as bad as…” he said before trailing off.
“In the best of times, [comedy’s] amazing,” Reynolds later said. “In the worst of times, it’s even better. So for me, it’s a real shelter in the storm, and I noticed that [holds true] for a lot of people too.”
He certainly realizes the importance of comedy in a variety of circumstances.  In fact, the actor has consistently demonstrated a knack for tackling the political with a lighter edge. After 2016 election night, he wrote in a tweet: “I watched Frozen without my two year old this morning. Despair reveals itself in many forms.” And recently, Reynolds encouraged his Twitter followers to talk about mental illness, tweeting “#MaximumEffort,” an allusion to “Deadpool.”
“I love smart comedy. In times of crisis I listen to Louis C.K. and a whole bunch of other people,” Reynolds said at the press conference. “I think its value is somewhat underappreciated in the arts in general. But overall I think it’s not going anywhere.”

Makeda Best began her journey to Harvard as an aspiring lawyer.  This would not be surprising, but as the new curator of photography at the Harvard Art Museums, she has taken paths that have led her far from her original plan. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Best shared the details of a path that took her to many places but ultimately led her to Harvard.
Best said that she never even thought about attending art school until she was in college. Before then, she had taken portraits of family and friends for fun, but never considered it to be more than a hobby. “I thought that the photography wasn’t really enough,” she said. “I wanted to do something bigger with it. I didn’t want to pursue it for awhile. I wanted to be a lawyer, to do something meaningful for the world.”
When she enrolled in college at Barnard, her pre-law plans were leading her towards a degree in history. She took some art history classes, and then decided to take on photography as an independent study class. She cites Benjamin Buchloh, with whom she studied at Barnard and who now teaches in the department of History of Art and Architecture at Harvard, as an inspiration. “Professor Benjamin Buchloh was the one who really introduced me to art school and the idea of pursuing art as more than just a hobby,” Best said. “At first, I was like, what is art school? Where would I go?”
After researching different art schools, she eventually decided to get a B.F.A from the California School of the Arts, where she also later received her M.F.A. At the time, however, she really didn’t have much of an idea. “One thing that I think is especially important for young people to know is that I had absolutely no plan as to what I was going to do. And I just went along with it,” she said.
At CalArts, Best said that she discovered that she wasn’t the best photographer. “I wasn’t into self-promotion, and getting my name out there for photography,” Best said. “I decided not to be an artist. And I actually haven’t made art since then, since graduating from CalArts.”After graduating from art school, she worked for various magazines and art museums before coming to Harvard for her Ph.D. in art history. Here, she specialized in the history of photography and graduated in 2010. Even though she never became a lawyer, she said that it will always be part of her interest. “The reason that I … wanted to be a lawyer in the first pace was that I wanted to serve society,” Best said. “I was very passionate about civil rights, social justice, and I wanted to be involved intellectually in it.”
As for her new role at the Harvard Art Museums, Best says that she wants to use her degree to tell the most enriching and accurate possible history of photography. She has a personal interest in war and conflict and said that she would like to add more photography relating to these issues to the collections.
Her favorite photographs, however, are not always so dramatic. One, for example, is J.N. Chamberlain’s photographs of a water spout. She explained that the image was photographed on a whim, but had a large impact in the scientific and meteorological fields because of how accurately and completely it captured a water spout. “It’s not really a famous piece of art,” she said. “But it teaches us to be curious all the time, and that everything is here for a reason.”
She also picks objects out for the collection that would suit teaching. As a teaching fellow for classes during graduate school at Harvard, she loved engaging with her students about the art pieces at she encouraged her students to engage with works of art at the Museums. “That’s when I realized that I really wanted to do this. How would I get a job with that?” she said. “But this is exactly it. It’s like a dream come true.”

Everyone’s seen Eugène Delacroix’s painting “Liberty Leading the People” at some point. Maybe it was in a history textbook, or on the cover of a favorite Coldplay album. What many people don’t realize, when they see its reproductions, is how gargantuan the painting is in real life.  Its sheer magnitude and detail are so overwhelming that you have to sit down on the little bench that the Louvre so generously provides. Its wild brushstrokes, the emotions etched across each face—you can spend hours poring over it, always noticing something new. The painting is actually a depiction of the July Revolution of 1830, one of the smaller rebellions that echoed across France in the wake of the political turmoil under the Bourbon monarchy. For this reason, this painting is often associated with another French masterpiece, Victor Hugo’s 1862 “Les Misérables,” which is also set around this time, during the June Rebellion of 1832. When I first saw the painting, I was speechless; everything around me seemed to dissolve until all that was left was the painting. I realized that I had only felt this way once before—it was the same way I felt about “Les Misérables,” which I regard as an authentic depiction of the human condition.
Since I first purchased the book when I was thirteen, my copy has been to three continents, even accompanying me back to its hometown of Paris for several weeks, during which I first saw Delacroix’s painting in person. It remains the most battered book on my shelf, containing innumerable rips, bends, and water-stained pages—some by rain and others by tears. The last 306 pages of the book still fall out, despite the heavy amount of tape that desperately tries to keep the whole thing together.
For you, “Les Misérables” may conjure up thoughts of the most famous song, from its musical adaptation, “I Dreamed a Dream.” Maybe you think of a starving Anne Hathaway belting out the well-known song in the gutter. But for me, it will always serve as fodder for my imagination and as the greatest comfort in the darkest hours—a beacon of hope when everything around me is crumbling to pieces.
“Les Misérables” spans 17 years and centers on the life of ex-convict Jean Valjean, imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and repeatedly attempting escape. Despite his intentions of starting anew after his release, Valjean is thrust into a cold world in which his criminal past brands him as an undesirable. After finally meeting kindness and acceptance at the hands of the Bishop of Digne, Valjean carves a new life for himself[, under a false identity in order to evade capture by the tireless Inspector Javert, who pursues him for breaking his parole. The novel also focuses on Fantine, a beautiful young woman who must turn to prostitution to provide for her child Cosette after her lover abandons her. Fantine’s death by tuberculosis leaves Cosette in the hands of Valjean, who adopts her as his own. The rest of the novel follows them in Paris during this turbulent era. At the same time, we are introduced to a myriad of characters who weave their way in and out of this labyrinth of a novel: the cruel Thenardiers, the idealist Marius, the troubled Javert, and the tragic Eponine.
Though reading it in French would be ideal, given the difficulty of capturing Hugo’s unmatched eloquence, the beauty of his prose transcends language barriers. Hugo is also a slave to details, perfectly describing characters in such a way that they begin to take shape before you. In a mere paragraph, he can capture the most enigmatic human emotions, from utter despair and frustration to unparalleled joy. He possesses an almost obsessive compulsion to incorporate contrasting motifs in each scene, evident in his use of lighting, in the clothing or in the personalities of the different characters. In the novel as a whole, Hugo has mastered the stark contrast between ugly social injustice and his protagonist’s beautiful journey of redemption. In a world still plagued with similar injustices, I find Hugo's portrait as relevant today as it was in the 19th century.

When a Columbia graduate student discovered Harlem Renaissance writer Claude McKay’s final novel, the world enthusiastically and gratefully accepted “Amiable with Big Teeth” into the literary canon. Set in Harlem in the 1930s, “Amiable with Big Teeth” explores the strained relationships between black Americans trying to aid Ethiopia after Mussolini’s invasion and white Communists using the cause to further their own. The novel is a testament to the racial tension and political scheming of the time. Claude McKay’s “Amiable with Big Teeth” is a satirical goldmine, a time capsule that encompasses a political labyrinth of treachery present in Harlem in the 1930s.
“Amiable with Big Teeth” centers around the divide in New York between the Communists and black patriots as they vied for the allegiance of Harlem’s African Americans. When an Ethiopian prince, Lij Alamaya, is sent by his nation’s government to gather African Americans for his country’s cause, he unknowingly puts himself in the middle of a tug-of-war between two enemy parties. While the Hands to Ethiopia, led by black leader Pablo Peixota, are trying to rally African Americans [toward][AROUND] the cause of the Ethiopians, the White Friends of Ethiopia, led by Maxim Tasan, are trying to pull them into the clutches of the Communist Party. For his own benefit, Tasan uses the Ethiopian cause to entice them. The novel thus pits black people against white people, patriotism against communism, and selflessness against egocentrism. Furthermore, McKay’s genuine depiction of Harlem emphasizes the novel’s sincerity. “Harlem is the stamping ground of false prophets,” mourns a character. “Amiable with Big Teeth” is indeed a tableau of the northern part of Manhattan. The setting for parades, parties, and protests, Harlem stands out as the heart and home of the story.
McKay’s characters encapsulate the driving force behind the satire by being effectively one-note. McKay’s contemporaries might not have appreciated hiss characters as much had the novel been published at the time because the characterizations would have been too simple and obvious to them, for they would have a clear understanding of what Harlem was like. But for today’s time, they are the perfect exemplars to illustrate the complexity of Harlem’s situation. Indeed, McKay uses simplicity to depict complexity. Each character is either good, bad, or lost, and each is so particularly recognizable in their being that the book clearly demarcates the different types of people and ideologies that might have existed in the 30s. Lij Alamaya is the Ethiopian emperor’s envoy to the United States; loyal to his country and passionate about his cause, he is initially too naive to understand the new society he is in. Seraphine is a giddy young woman trying to navigate both her romantic life and racial identity. Peixota is the fervent, self-sacrificing believer in the cause. Maxim Tasan is the duplicitous self-serving snake.
“Amiable with Big Teeth” undeniably enriches the literary world. Not only is it renowned author Claude McKay’s final novel, it also serves as a poignant time capsule capable of transporting those who want to be immersed in a world they may never have heard of. It reveals the politics behind protests, underlines enduring racial tensions of the time, and establishes the climate in Harlem in the years leading up to World War II. With his vividly described characters and setting, McKay depicts a vanished time that remains relevant today.

The most memorable thing about Claude Barras’s French-Swiss stop-motion film, “Ma Vie de Courgette” (“My Life as a Zucchini”), is the expression in the puppets’ eyes. Courgette’s are rimmed with a chilly blue and little floating brows that slope down sweetly, giving a very open look to his face. He always looks tired, and if the corners of his tiny cherry-pink lips were slightly droopier he would look like a World War II-era poster of a boy soldier with a thousand-yard stare. But the nuances of his very small smile and his bright red ears turn his sadness into a lovely sense of vulnerability. It is because of such gentle subtleties that the film seems to shine from a place deep inside.
“Ma Vie de Courgette” tells the story of an orphaned boy who slowly comes to find love and friendship at his new orphanage. The children there are all a little odd and come from troubled backgrounds, and initially Courgette has a hard time adjusting. He faces bullying from the very redheaded and red-clothed Simon, although they later become friends, and he finds a fascination in the gentle, low-ponytailed Camille, who might soon be taken away by her terrible aunt for the child-support money.
The film is short and sweet like its protagonist—only 66 minutes—and the plot is threadbare, leaving room for myriad little details to flesh out the slowly developing relationships. The story is one that is often seen in movies--the inspiring tale of the new kid in school finding his place—but it is executed with such sincerity and sensitivity that its usage of tropes feels irrelevant. The sequence of events and emotional landmarks depicted in the film feels perfectly natural and true to the psychology of a child who finds himself parentless in a strange new world.
Also like Courgette himself, this film is a quiet one—there is no internal dialogue from Courgette, and so much is left for the viewer to intuit from carefully chosen camera angles, sounds, and situations. In one scene Courgette is lying in bed, and he quickly burrows under his blanket and pretends to be asleep when he hears the other children come in. The camera remains fixed in Courgette’s little corner, so that we can see his open eyes blinking silently at the darkened wall. We hear the caretaker’s footsteps echoing around the room as she distributes good-night kisses, all while trapped in the small enclosed space under Courgette’s blanket. Although the film’s illustrative style is quirky and fantastical, featuring bright crayon-color hair and custom-designed head shapes, the actual events feel sharply realistic.
Courgette finds a kindred spirit in Camille—they are both gentle and weary souls with similar tiny heart-shaped faces and perfectly round, melancholy eyes. Their budding romance, like everything else in the film, is understated and delicate. The children whisper nervously about sex—Simon claims to know almost everything from his parents’ old DVDs—and they discuss the romantic relationship between Rosy, their caretaker, and Mr. Ahmed, their teacher, and how their new baby came to be. Talk of sex is treated lightly by the grown-ups, and the children’s anxious interest comes off as wonderfully endearing, fading into the film’s broader focus on love. In one of the most poignant scenes of the film, the children are on a ski trip, and they all watch, with hunger in their eyes, a mother fussing over her child. “There’s nobody left to love us,” Simon tells Courgette. But the film is full of hope, and it gently invites the viewer to adopt them all for the hour.

ImeIme A. Umana ’14’s historic election as the first black woman president of the Harvard Law Review is one deserving of heartfelt congratulations. We are gratified to see a woman of color breaking barriers in such a high-profile position, and believe that her election shows young girls of color around the country that their futures have limitless potential. Umana is an inspiration to these girls, and this in itself is an admirable path of scholarship and public service. We hope that other girls will similarly run for leadership positions in organizations where they once were not even allowed in the door.
Amid the celebration of Umana’s achievement, however, we must not too hastily extrapolate a broader societal point. Too often, media attention focuses on the individual accomplishments of minority students, holding them up as emblematic of broader holistic progress towards equality. This narrative, however, overlooks the disparities that continue to plague our society. In the domain of law, obstacles remain for both women and racial minorities. Just 38 percent of law review editors-in-chief at the top 50 law schools are women, and in 2010 just 5 percent of practicing lawyers were black. Indeed, the mere fact that it took until 2017 for a black woman to become president of the Harvard Law Review shows just how much progress is left to be made.
In light of these sobering statistics, Harvard has an obligation to do everything in its power to ensure that students of color, and students from other marginalized communities, are consistently able to reach the same degree of success as Umana. Many elite academic organizations, including this one, have in the past been dominated by white men. The University must ensure that students from diverse backgrounds feel comfortable entering these spaces and have the resources necessary to attain leadership roles. This includes direct outreach to these students, providing diversity workshops to current members, and responding to reports of discrimination both quickly and thoughtfully.
True cultural reform will only occur when institutions of higher learning such as Harvard attain a critical mass of diverse voices. One person, no matter their position, is never enough. Indeed, it is neither fair nor logical to expect Umana to represent all women of color. A multitude of voices is required to push these organizations to continually modernize and become more inclusive.
In light of the need for more holistic change, it is heartening that the election for the Law Review’s president included eight students of color and eight women, out of an overall pool of twelve candidates. This statistic is perhaps more demonstrative of the Law School’s shifting demographics, and symbolizes broader change on the horizon. We expect that Umana will be joined in her tenure by a diverse group of talented editors, and that they will each use their voices to advocate for an open, meritocratic Law Review. And we hope that some of the young girls reading about her election will one day follow in her footsteps and assume such a role themselves.

“Tú eres una mezcla de cultura, lleno de oportunidades que tu familia no tenía. Usalos, y olvide el mundo. Solo es ti que importa.”
My grandmother sits me down firmly and tells me this, but I can’t hear her. "Você é uma menina branca, que não entende." I can feel the bricks of the stoop biting into the back of my five-year-old knees as my eyes smart, hurt by the insults of the piragua vendor at the corner who sneered, jeering that blancitas weren’t allowed in this part of Newark. "Eres una blancita que no entiende nada." My sister saunters towards me, her olive-toned hands cradling her red shaved ice, and my face begins to burn, marring the constellation of freckles on my face, in the hopes I could grow up one day to look like her—Hispanic.
All my life I have felt the need to validate myself, to somehow point to the archetypal version of a Hispanic girl–dark hair, dark eyes, sun-kissed skin—and see a reflecting pool, an acceptable version of myself staring back with open arms. In my youth, I allowed my individuality to molt, rendered my persona putty to the ideas of the many in lieu of my own in the hopes that I would feel accepted within my culture. If all it took for me to be accepted as Latina by others was to sing along to a Hector Lavoe song or eat arroz con gandules, then I would immediately mold myself to those expectations—even though I knew I disliked (read: despised) beans. Facets of my personality were constantly in flux with what I thought others expected of me to resemble my kin. Although it wasn’t spoken aloud quite often, I didn’t fit in physically with the rest of my family members. With a longer frame and freckled features, I jutted out of the family portrait like a pale smudge on the frame; I didn’t fit in.
My insecurities wielded their omnipotence with a heavy hand, armed with an even heavier sword of a dichotomous family. Being the product of mixed heritage—Puerto Rican and Portuguese—I was the aggregation of two diverse cultures clashing together, a tsunami that rose within a little girl with eyes the size of two very different worlds. This little girl clutched her piragua, wiped away her tears and held her grandmother’s hand.
Yet, as a sword can be used to rob a man of his life, so can it be used to protect it. These words were my lifeline for years; they were a mantra I repeated to myself when others invalidated my cultural experience due to my appearance time and time again. My family, which once saddled me indirectly (in their embodiment of ethnic stereotypes) with the lot of self-doubt and timidity, bolstered my development on a framework of support and unity. Within my tight-knit family, I was welcomed without any hesitation as to whether I fit the mold seamlessly or not, whether I spoke all three languages fluently enough or looked the stereotypical part at a moment’s notice—they were home for me.
But this was me, tracing my silhouette with my own hands again. How easily they find their way around—the familiar road bumps, stop signs—a yield to pedestrians here and there. This was the same game I’ve been playing for years, telling myself that I’ve finally broken down this barrier, hurdled past this obstacle for the last time. This was going to be the day I called my grandmother and asked her for her bendicion. This was going to be the day I relearned Portuguese. This was going to be the day I went to the Fuerza meeting and proved to myself how Hispanic I am. How easily I sell myself different lies to justify the same reflection.
I haven’t made any calls to Newark lately, and I haven’t been to a Fuerza meeting yet.
The map of me hasn’t changed, despite the few hundred miles between me and the piragua guy. All the caution signs and dead ends are still hidden in these well-traveled roads beneath the skin—and the piraguas of my youth haven’t faded either. The vendor still does his rounds on sunny weekends on Mt. Prospect, and I still order the coco or limón – whatever that may say about me.
Change isn’t an immutable force of nature; it is a body I have held close to me for decades—a stranger, a lover, an enemy, an Übermensch-form of me, if you will. It is both the hope and fear for the future. My culture will become my culture only when I change my perception of it—not when the ideas of others change it for me. Yet somehow, knowing all this, it isn’t enough to reconcile my thoughts with this body.
Eventually, I know I’ll crack; I’ll pick up the phone and hold my breath while the ring reverberates, anticipation strung up like a marionette before my grandmother picks up the phone and tells me instinctively:
"Yo te bendigo y te favorezco."
And this will set me free.

“You’ve had a lot of advantages, you know,” he told me, “ones that not a lot of people have, starting with how you came here.” Yikes. I assume that he meant how I came to America—a nice tinge of xenophobia rounds out his statement. It’s winter break, and we are both servers at a local restaurant chain. The relentless nature of the work prevents me from formulating a response beyond a conciliatory “Yes—I am aware of my advantages.”
At first glance, it seems contradictory for a white male to lecture a female person of color about her advantages. However, if you delve a layer deeper, into the advantages and disadvantages which are not immediately apparent, you would know that one of us is from a working-class family in a small town where higher education resources are not easily available. You would also find that the other grew up grew up in a family with two college-educated parents who deeply ingrained the value of education into her and sent her to a magnet school which emphasized college-preparedness. I fit that second description, and was being completely truthful when I said I was aware of the advantages I have had—ones largely invisible to the casual observer.
Here at Harvard, we place a lot of emphasis upon who can speak about certain issues based on their affiliation to certain groups, often assuming that one’s skin color (white) and gender (male) situate them within an insulated utopia which precludes any real understanding of hardship. However, this winter break experience allowed me to see another perspective, one in which being white did not automatically correlate with being privileged—the view which dominates within the Harvard bubble. This experience, along with the recent (and devastating) election results, has convinced me of the monumental importance of not dismissing anyone’s views based upon offhand assumptions about their experiences.
As we try to understand what happened to our country, and which factors precipitated Trump’s rise, perhaps we have to look no further than our own classrooms, where we exclude opinions and viewpoints coming from those whom we assume we can never understand based on their putative privileges.  It is all too easy to tell every white male they don’t understand what it is to struggle, to vilify them as the enemy, as ignorant, and the oppressor. But such accusations are both blatantly untrue and dismissive of the wide range of setbacks and obstacles that all people face.
In a recent opinion piece in The New York Times' Sunday Review, Mark Lilla of Columbia University writes that “in recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism’s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.” He decries the notion that “whitelash” is the all-encompassing explanation for the election outcome, and instead urges readers to consider the necessity of emphasizing commonalities between Americans. His message is clear: If we can not realize the importance of including a wider array of voices into conversations of social justice, education, the economy, and a host of other sociopolitical issues, unification in our country becomes untenable.
This is not to dismiss the very real difficulties and discrimination which countless people have experienced based upon some element of their racial, sexual, or gender identity. Rather, I wish to call attention to the value of communication and call out the harm of assuming that every obstacle a person has encountered is written on their face. People change their minds through understanding others’ experiences, and a primary way to do this is to engage in discussion.
Instead of assuming that it is someone’s ignorance and privilege that leads them to say something insensitive, we can make progress by resisting the urge to dismiss their perspective, and instead realize that it is through discussion that people learn to consider a wider array of points of view. Repudiating someone’s perspective is counterproductive because in doing so, we miss important opportunities for education, as anyone’s wish to even join a conversation signals a willingness to learn and understand.
We must realize that it is impossible to tell who has had certain advantages and who hasn’t just by looking at them. If we are to forge a way forward for our generation, we must make every effort to incorporate every voice into the conversation.

About a year after mumps first arrived on campus, Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira said there are currently no confirmed cases of the virus on campus.
Last spring, a months-long outbreak culminated in 66 total cases of mumps at Harvard. Although the disease died down by the start of the fall semester, HUHS confirmed five active cases of mumps on campus in Dec. 2016.
HUHS confirmed the first two active cases of mumps at the College and Divinity School in Feb. 2016. The disease had infected 58 Harvard affiliates by the end of the 2016 spring semester and spread to nearby universities like Boston University and Tufts.
Barreira said mumps outbreaks are not uncommon at large universities.
“You’ve got this dense living arrangement, and you’re all sharing water bottles and everything else so it’s easy to spread the virus,” he said. In spring 2016, HUHS encouraged mumps patients to quarantine themselves at the Harvard Inn, and many infected students spent their spring breaks in isolation.
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, mumps cases were more frequent in 2016 than they had been in nearly a decade. Massachusetts was one of eight states that reported more than 100 cases of the disease.
Barreira said the mumps outbreak at Harvard fit the typical pattern of spreading of disease across universities.
“There’s huge numbers of students who get infected and then it dwindles. Then the following summer and semester, there’s just a little bit of cases like the kind that we had, but generally the larger outbreak doesn’t recur,” he said.
Barreira said last semester’s cases—which infected two at the College and two at the Business School—were unsurprising, adding that he “would not be shocked to hear a few more cases going around” currently.
Barreira said it’s likely that some past mumps cases at other universities went unnoticed because many developed countries include vaccinations against the disease in their immunization programs.
“They don’t particularly think about it as mumps because it’s actually pretty rare,” Barreira said, adding that at Harvard, nurses and doctors “suddenly became experts at looking what [mumps] looked like.”
Barreira said everyone at Harvard is required to vaccinate against mumps. Because the vaccine has a roughly 80 percent success rate, however, some students could have been infected even with the vaccine.
Barreira added that HUHS does not anticipate a large number of mumps cases in the near future.
“I don’t expect much,” he said.

John A. Lithgow ’67, an Adams House alumnus and renowned American actor, will be the 24th recipient of the annual Harvard Arts Medal in April.
Most recently known for his role in the Netflix series “The Crown,” Lithgow will receive the medal at the 25th annual “ARTS FIRST” festival—which he helped establish—on April 27. Established in 1995, the Harvard Arts Medal is awarded annually to a graduate of Harvard or Radcliffe to recognize excellence in the arts.
Lithgow will add the Harvard Arts Medal to a lengthy list of accolades he has received over the course of his career. The actor has received two Tony awards, five Emmy awards, two Golden Globes, and three Screen Actors Guild awards.
“John Lithgow is an extraordinary actor who has enriched and entertained the world with unforgettable stage and screen performances,” Drew Faust said to the Harvard Gazette. “We owe the launch of Arts First—this year celebrating its 25th anniversary—to his unfailing efforts and his lifelong belief in the abundance and power of our creative community.”
After graduating magna cum laude as a History and Literature concentrator, Lithgow went on to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art as a Fulbright Scholar. He has also served on the Harvard Board of Overseers, the University's second-highest governing board.
Lithgow spoke at Harvard's commencement exercises in 2005, and was the first-ever professional actor to deliver a Harvard commencement address. Last spring, Lithgow narrated an “Ode to the Library: Widener turns 100,” a video celebrating the 100th birthday of Widener Library in June 2015.
Past recipients of the Arts Medal include actor Matt Damon ’92, cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76, and writers John H. Updike ’54 and Margaret E. Atwood.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 7, 2017, at 12:02 a.m.
This weekend, El Jefe’s Taqueria was in it to win it.
With hundreds of locals gathered Saturday afternoon in Harvard Square, the competition was on. Beat Brasserie, Crema Cafe, El Jefe’s, Grendel’s Den, En Boca and the Sinclair were all after the same goal: the Harvard Square Chili Pot trophy.
In the ninth annual “Some Like it Hot Chili Cook-Off,” the six restaurants served up chili to win the votes of samplers and local judges, while percussion group Grooversity played on. El Jefe’s  won the contest in its second year participating, taking home what some refer to as the “Stanley Cup of Harvard Square.”
The Harvard Square Business Association hosts the annual contest to promote its member businesses and draw traffic to the Square.
“The most important thing that we can do for our members is to give people a reason to come to Harvard Square on a cold Saturday in January and February,” said Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
And come they did.
“The atmosphere was festive, and we know from some our participants that they gave over 1,000 samples of chili,” Jillson said. “It was a good day, good attendance, festive atmosphere, delicious chili.”
El Jefe’s won unanimously, clinching both the “electoral college” vote—determined by celebrity judges including Cambridge City Manager Louis DePasquale—and the popular vote from people who attended and sampled.
Patricia Flores, manager at El Jefe’s, said she was proud of the restaurant's win.
“Last year unfortunately we didn’t win, we lost by two votes, so the pressure was definitely on this year to make our chili the best and actually get the trophy,” she said
“They upped their game, as did all of our restaurants,” Jillson said.
Jillson said that the vote was very close, and she complimented the chili that each restaurant prepared.
“But what was very interesting is how close it really was in terms of the vote, which doesn’t always happen. Sometimes there’s an overwhelming winner, and this year, really, I have to say, Grendel’s Den and Crema Cafe and En Boca and the Sinclair and the Beat were neck and neck, neck and neck,” Jillson said.
Flores said El Jefe’s won due to the distinctiveness of their chili.
“Our chili is different taste-wise. It tastes different than normal American chili,” Flores said. “It’s a Mexican chili: it’s spicier, different flavors, different seasonings, and it’s not as hearty as traditional American chili.”
In addition to the chili contest itself, several other chili-related festivities took place in the Square Saturday. J.P. Licks offered chocolate chili ice cream samples on Church St., an expansion from previous years. Chili consumers could also make s’mores in a designated area for the treat.
Though El Jefe’s clinched the title, Kari M. Kuelzer, general manager at Grendel’s Den, said the event is a victory for the restaurant every time it participates.
“Grendel’s Den, because we actually serve chili at our restaurant all the time, we actually win this every time we do this event because we are putting our product into the mouths of the customers,” Kuelzer said. “No matter what the ballots say, it’s such a positive for us to be able to showcase something that we serve at our restaurant that we’re proud of.”
En Boca, a Mediterranean tapas restaurant, participated for the first time this year.
“We were very excited to welcome them as the new kid on the block and they had a wonderful day,” Jillson said. “It’s terrific for them to be able to talk about their new restaurant and direct people over to Holyoke Street to visit them, particularly at a time that they’re under construction.”

The Harvard University Police Department is investigating the theft of six laptops, a cell phone, and wallets  from unlocked dorm rooms Lowell House's E and F entryways late Saturday night.
On Sunday morning, HUPD received three reports of stolen property, including a report that a burglar entered three rooms of a single suite. In an emailed statement, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said that “all three rooms were unlocked.”
The thefts are reported to have occurred between 9 p.m. Saturday night and 1:30 a.m. the next morning.
The HUPD investigation is “active and ongoing,” according to Catalano. None of the residents encountered any potential suspects, and the police have not identified any suspects.
In an email sent around 11 a.m. on Sunday to residents of Lowell House, Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03 asked students to report any unusual activity or suspicious people they may have seen the night before.
“Some people were asleep in their beds when their stuff was taken,” Casey wrote. “Obviously, that is terrifying.”
In an attempt to prevent future losses of property, Casey reminded residents to not allow strangers into the House and to stay vigilant around campus.
“Harvard feels like a bubble,” Casey wrote, “[B]ut we live in a city and we all need to take precautions.”
Approximately 90 laptops are stolen on campus every year, according to HUPD’s annual security report. A string of thefts last year prompted the Undergraduate Council to call for security cameras outside residential halls, and in September 2016, thousands of dollars worth of laptops were stolen across campus. In many of the cases, students whose valuables were stolen left their doors unlocked.
“Don’t tape your doors or leave your key in your lock,” Casey warned.

Cambridge City Councillors modified existing zoning ordinances regarding medical marijuana dispensaries, permitting the establishment of potentially “five or six” new dispensaries in the city, according to Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern.
In addition to the new ordinance, City Councillors Dennis J. Carlone and Jan Devereux proposed two amendments, both of which passed unanimously. Carlone’s amendment requires that the Ordinance Board revisit the amendment should new state laws be passed that affects existing marijuana legislation, and Devereux’s amendment increased the permitted distance between marijuana dispensaries from 1,500 to 1,800 feet.
The main motion to approve the new zoning regulations for medical marijuana dispensaries—which passed in the City Councillors' 6-3 vote—stipulates that dispensaries must comply with local and state marijuana regulations, notably failing to mention existing federal laws around medical marijuana use.
In addition, the motion lays out the geographic bounds of the locations of these dispensaries. Dispensaries cannot be located within 500 feet of any place where children regularly congregate, including schools, daycares, and arcades. The new zoning rules permit for dispensaries in eight different zoning areas around Cambridge, like Porter Square, Harvard Square, Central Square, and Kendall Square.
Despite its passing, the motion was criticized by the city’s planning board, who wrote an official recommendation to the City Council airing concerns about the proposed ordinances.
The planning board cited “a great deal of uncertainty” regarding non-medical marijuana regulations, which could operations of medical marijuana dispensaries. Following a lengthy discussion, council members Craig A. Kelley, David P. Maher, and Timothy J. Toomey Jr. voted against the measure.
“This is not a big buffer. This is very, very small” Maher said, referencing the original 1500 foot buffer between different medical marijuana dispensaries.
Councillor Leland Cheung disagreed and claimed the regulations were reasonable.
“I just want to say 1500 feet is more than four football fields,” Cheung said. “I think 1500 makes sense.”
McGovern agreed with Cheung, saying he believed that medical marijuana should be allowed wherever there is a doctor’s office.
“It doesn’t take the control away from the city.” McGovern said. “It adds control, it adds predictability.”
Even though the City Council passed the new zoning regulations, McGovern said the medical marijuana dispensary ordinance does not allow for the establishment of recreational marijuana dispensaries.
“I think these are two separate issues.” McGovern said. “I think the regulations around recreational marijuana are going to be a long time in the works.”
Recreational marijuana was approved by a state-wide ballot initiative in November with about 54 percent of voters agreeing to legalize the drug.
Recreational marijuana dispensaries may open as early as July 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates from across the United States convened at Harvard’s Institute of Politics to look back at the November presidential election and reflect on the nation’s political climate.
Started in 2003, the “National Campaign and Political Engagement Conference” brings together more than 70 undergraduates from 28 schools involved in campaigning on campuses during the most recent election cycle. Attendees spent most of the weekend in small group settings discussing their past campaign experiences and plans for future civic engagement at their respective schools.
Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III and former Congressman William D. Delahunt kicked off the conference Friday with opening remarks that emphasized a need to foster bipartisan respect and a need to heal wounds of what they characterized as a divisive campaign season.
John Della Volpe, the IOP's director of, opened the second day of the conference on Saturday with a town hall, asking students to share their partisan affiliation and to formulate a list of issues they deemed pressing to national politics. Students then broke out into small group discussions to think of initiatives or policies that could contribute to solving issues related to citizenship, inequality, and the media.
Despite a recent IOP poll that found young Americans were divided—mostly along party lines—in their opinions on the future of the United States, when asked if the US was headed in the right direction, not a single student at the conference raised their hand.
An informal straw poll conducted by Della Volpe found that the attendance of the conference leaned left, though Republicans and Independents were represented in moderate numbers.
Jeremy Salley, a student at the University of Southern California, worked in a group focusing on the category of inequality. Salley said he was particularly inspired by discussions of education in the United States.
“I’m getting a chance to tackle issues that are really hitting home for me. Education is major. We’re working on education as a grassroots approach for inequality. That’s probably the top thing, one of the top three reasons for the outcome of the election and what we’re seeing today in America,” Salley said.
Later, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and Kennedy School professor David R.Gergen spoke about today’s political divisiveness and similar moments in American history. The speakers discussed presidencies of Harvard alumnus Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, both subjects of Goodwin biographies, as a means of analyzing present day American political disagreements.
Mariam Eatedali, a conference attendee from the University of Virginia, said she looked for parallels between Goodwin and Gergen’s discussion of history and our current shifting attitudes toward the presidency.
“Professor Gergen had talked about how Teddy Roosevelt was fearless and we heard stories from Dr. Goodwin about of course Lincoln from ‘Team of Rivals,’ but I think I wanted to know what... President Trump’s definition is,” Eatedali said. “ How is the presidency changing?”

Four Harvard faculty members joined in filing an amicus brief in a federal appeals court Sunday night to support another legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s immigration order.
Over 200 law professors and clinicians signed the brief filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by Fatma Marouf, a Harvard Law School alumna and Director of the Immigration Law Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law.
The brief is the second signed by Harvard affiliates opposing the executive order in three days. Last week, Harvard signed an amicus brief in a Boston federal court challenging the order, which bars immigrants from seven predominantly-Muslim countries from entering the country for 90 days.
Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic Director Deborah E. Anker worked with Marouf— her former student—to draft the brief, and assistant director Sabrineh Ardalan helped compile signatures. Anker, Ardalan, Law School professor Bruce Hay, and School of Public Health professor Jacqueline Bhabha are all signatories.
The law professors and clinicians argue that their “first-hand” experience working with clients makes their perspectives relevant to the case.  The executive order “creates a serious risk of irreparable harm to our clients, students, and colleagues who have nonimmigrant (temporary) visas at United States universities,” they charge.
The order initially prevented at least four Harvard affiliates from entering the country, and if enforced, it could jeopardize visas of over 100 Harvard students and scholars from the listed countries.
The brief asserts that the order would hinder universities’ ability to attract international students and scholars and jeopardize the funding schools receive from international affiliates. It also claims that the order violates due process, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.
“Our goal was to really highlight the type of harm that international students and faculty face as a result of the ban on individuals from the seven countries, in terms of both the diversity of thought in academia, fear of traveling abroad for conferences, and students just worrying about their visas being revoked,” Marouf said in an interview.
Washington State originally brought the suit last week, arguing that Trump’s executive order caused harm to the state. Seattle federal judge James Robart issued a temporary injunction Friday evening blocking enforcement of the order nationwide—a ruling the Trump administration has challenged in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The case will likely reach the Supreme Court.
The Justice Department filed an emergency motion to restore enforcement of the order Saturday, but the appellate court declined to grant that motion and imposed a Monday deadline for parties to submit briefs for further consideration. Marouf and those helping her at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Law Clinic had just one day to compile their amicus brief.
Marouf contacted her alma mater’s clinic, which she said originally inspired her to become an immigration lawyer, and the group of immigration law clinicians circulated the brief for signatures Sunday.
“I was thinking of it as being a brief on behalf of immigration professors and clinicians because we’ve been very directly affected,” Marouf said. “But the interest among law professors was so great, and so many people wanted to have a voice in it, that we ended up widening it to law professors and clinicians more generally.”
The American Civil Liberties Union, a group of over 100 technology companies, and another group of law professors have also filed amicus briefs. Meanwhile, the state of Minnesota has joined Washington State as a plaintiff.
The appeals court will hear oral arguments in the case Tuesday, and the court’s ruling will determine whether the Seattle judge’s suspension of the order remains in place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Jamaican entrepreneur has launched an appeal in a lawsuit he brought against the Harvard Business Review in 2016 that alleged the publication printed libelous information about his career in a case study it published.
A Georgia district court judge dismissed Donovan E. Crawford’s initial suit, arguing his court did not have jurisdiction over the case because the disputed materials were published for use in Canada. The 11th Circuit United States court of appeals will hear the case.
Crawford claims the publication printed slanderous and factually incorrect information about him when it published a case study on Century National Bank. where Crawford was previously employed. A section of the case study claimed that Crawford “exercised strong, direct influence on the policies, management and operations of CNB,” characteristics that the study said “got in the way of professional banking ethics” and contributed to a decline in business for the bank.
“An audit conducted by the [Bank of Jamaica] in 1993 revealed that, in some cases, credit had been granted on the sole instruction of the managing director and with minimal, if any, documentation,” the case study reads. “Additionally, the cash resources were inflated by deposits used to secure loans to the personal companies of the managing director.”
Crawford argues that these descriptions have had a ruinous effect on his reputation and his ability to do business. He is currently retired.
Allan A. Ryan, the director of intellectual property for the Business Review, denied all of Crawford’s claims in an interview on Monday.
“Mr. Donovan Crawford—he claims that there were some statements in that case that injured him, injured his reputation and so forth, and we denied that that was so,” Ryan said. “The statements are actually quite innocuous.”
Crawford’s suit, which along with two other similar suits filed against universities, sought a collective $230 million in damages for what he described in court filings as a malicious “desire to injure” him. Crawford, who represented himself in court, wrote that he was no longer “eligible as a business executive to secure financial support” after the study's publication.
Ryan said it is likely that the appeal process could take several more months. According to him, this case is a “totally unique” suit for the Business Review, which he said does not often field legal challenges.
Crawford could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 6, 2017, at 11:30 p.m.
BOSTON — Two years ago, a 3-1 lead vanished against Boston University. Last season, a 2-1 third-period edge over Boston College disappeared just the same. And Monday night, a 4-1 advantage versus Northeastern was beginning to shrink.
Attacking relentlessly with their goalie pulled to keep Beanpot hopes alive, the Huskies pulled to within one score of the No. 4/5 Harvard men’s hockey team with just 1:33 remaining. Making matters worse, a lengthy goal review followed, leaving TD Garden attendees with ample time to ponder whether the demons of Crimson Beanpot past might be in town for their almost annual appearance.
But on this occasion, Harvard's four goals—scored exclusively by a senior class stuck playing in its seventh straight Beanpot matinee—proved to be enough. Enough to hold off the pesky Huskies. Enough to erase a nine-year championship game drought. And enough to put the Crimson in position to claim its first Beanpot trophy in 24 years next Monday.
“I don’t think you really experience the Beanpot until you have a chance to play in the finals,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think it’s an important step for our group, and I know our senior leadership was on display.”
Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot, defenseman Clay Anderson, and forwards Tyler Moy and Luke Esposito all lit the lamp to help set up next Monday’s marquee matchup against No. 3 Boston University. But it wasn’t until the third period that the Crimson’s seniors broke the game open.
An unlikely scorer by trade, Anderson gave Harvard (16-5-2, 11-4-2 ECAC) its first lead of the final frame with just nine seconds remaining on a Crimson power play stemming from a slash against Northeastern’s Sam Kurker. Collecting a feed from Esposito atop the slot, Harvard’s eldest defenseman sent a slapper past goaltender Ryan Ruck to put Harvard up, 2-1, with 12:21 to play in the contest.
Hardly two minutes later, Moy doubled the Crimson advantage from Ruck’s left post, persistently poking at a loose puck behind the sprawled-out netminder until it slipped into the back of the net. Then down a man with 7:42 to go, Esposito took advantage of some shaky goaltending, knocking in a rebound off a Kerfoot blast to up the edge to 4-1.
The three-goal margin would not last for long, however, as Northeastern associate captain Nolan Stevens knocked home the Huskies’ second goal of the night from the edge of the crease about a minute later on the man advantage—one of two conversions for a power-play unit ranked second in the country.
The game would remain 4-2 for another five minutes, but with 1:33 remaining in regulation, a sea of bodies—then the puck—went tumbling into Merrick Madsen’s net, effectively creating a whole new ball game.
Over the course of the lengthy review that followed—one that yielded inconclusive evidence as to whether the call on the ice was correct—Donato gathered his team and told them to expect the call to stand.
“We just tried to get the group together and said, ‘Hey, listen. We’re going to have to win the last minute and a half to win the hockey game,” Donato recalled. “‘Let’s not have our heart set on what this result comes back. Let’s just be ready to battle.’”
Battle Harvard did, but that didn’t stop an attempted equalizer off the stick of junior Dylan Sikura from nearly trickling past Madsen as the final seconds wound off the clock. In the end, however, each tick came off the board, and the Crimson eked out a 4-3 victory.
The seven-goal sum between the two sides was hardly a surprising outcome, as both Northeastern (11-12-5, 5-9-3 Hockey East) and Harvard entered Monday with top-10 scoring offenses and top-three power-play units. But it was an outcome that had grown rather unlikely after the opening 30 minutes of action lacked many scoring chances.
“I thought both teams played careful,” Donato said. “We had a lot of respect for them offensively…. We wanted to make sure that we weren’t jumpstarting their offense by being careless with the puck.”
Cautious hockey resulted in the two teams combining for just 11 shots on goal in the opening frame—the lowest first-period shot total Harvard’s been a part of all season. But the Crimson began to push the tempo in the second, throwing 12 shots at Ruck in the frame.
Only one of those attempts flew past the netminder, and it was certainly the luckiest. Just as Kurker gained possession in the Harvard zone and began moving the puck up along the right boards, sophomore defenseman Viktor Dombrovskiy cut his progress short from the blue paint.
Then stationed just outside the slot with the rest of his teammates already having left the zone, Kerfoot stretched his stick far enough in the air to redirect a Dombrovskiy flailer past Ruck from distance.
Kerfoot’s breakthrough was eventually answered before second period’s end by sophomore Adam Gaudette, who finished with two goals on the night for the Huskies. But Harvard’s three-goal third made all the difference in sending the Crimson to Monday’s tournament finale.
“I think it’ll be cool to come out for warm-ups and [have] more than seven people in the stands,” Kerfoot said. “We haven’t played a night game. I think for the last three years, it’s been pretty demoralizing coming on the second Monday and playing in that consolation game. No one wants to be a part of that.”
“But we want to go one step further and win the championship,” the co-captain added. “We’re really excited for next weekend, and we’ll be ready.”
GAME NOTES
Junior goaltender Merrick Madsen made 27 saves in the win but sustained a lower-body injury in the final seconds of regulation that left him struggling to reach his feet after the final whistle sounded. The junior would eventually join the handshake line, but he had to hobble his way off the ice.
Donato said in the postgame presser that the injury did not appear to be anything major, and at the very least, he didn’t expect Madsen to miss any extended period of time. Only time will tell whether Donato’s words hold true.

This weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team traveled to Evanston, Ill., to compete in two non-conference matches. On Saturday, the Crimson took on No.9 Northwestern, while the squad faced off against Boise State the following day.
While the team fell to the undefeated Wildcats (9-0), it ended the weekend on a high note with a sweeping win against Boise State (1-6).
“We had a tough loss Saturday,” co-captain Jean Thirouin said. “We really wanted to bounce back and finish the weekend strong. Everyone fought really hard the whole weekend and it showed.”
Harvard 7, Boise State, 0
Harvard (5-3) started off on a strong note on Sunday by taking the doubles point early on, with a win from sophomore Chris Morrow and rookie Logan Weber. With the 6-2 win, the duo claimed a 2-0 record in doubles for the weekend. While Boise State took second doubles, the top team of junior Kenny Tao and senior Brian Yeung snagged a crucial 6-4 win at first doubles to give the Crimson the edge.
“We all wanted the win really badly, and I think that showed when we fought hard to win the doubles point,” Tao said. “That changed the momentum of the match, and we all went up a set very quickly, and eventually sealed the win.”
Harvard went on to sweep all six of the day’s singles matches.
Tao, Yeung, junior Grant Solomon, and sophomore Sam Beren claimed two-set victories at first, second, fifth, and sixth singles, respectively.  Beren’s win was his first career dual match win.
“It was his first time playing in the singles lineup,” Tao said, “He took a tough loss against Northwestern, but I think he really stepped it up to get the first singles win against Boise.”
Thirouin, at third singles, and sophomore Andy Zhou both had matches that went into the third set. While Thirouin fell in a close tiebreaker in the first set, he came back to win the second set and edge out his Boise State opponent in the third set tiebreaker. Zhou, on the other hand, swept the first set, 6-2, fell short in the second set, but also came back in the third set for a win.
The win will go down as the last match the Crimson will play before ECAC Championships in Princeton, N.J. in two weekends.
Northwestern, 4, Harvard, 0
The Crimson struggled to find its footing against the ninth-ranked Wildcats team on Saturday. While Morrow and Weber claimed an early victory at third doubles, Northwestern came back at first and second doubles to take the doubles point.
Yeung and Tao then fell to Northwestern co-captains Konrad Zieba and Sam Shropshire at first doubles, and the Wildcats earned the deciding point over Thirouin and sophomore Michael Peters at second doubles, 6-4.
“We hung in there really well in a lot of the matches, but again a few points here and there decided the outcome,” Tao said.
On the singles side, Harvard failed to earn a point against Northwestern. Tao was defeated by Kirchheimer, the No. 26 collegiate singles player in the nation, at first singles 6-3, 6-3. Although Yeung took the second set against Shropshire at second doubles, the game went unfinished.
“They were a bit sharper than us up and down the lineup Saturday,” Thirouin said. “Everyone fought really hard which showed in the second sets. I think a few more matches and we'd be ready to give them an even more competitive match.”
Thirouin fell to Zieba, 6-1, 6-4, at third singles, and both Zhou and Solomon did not finish their matches at fourth and fifth singles, respectively.
Beren fell to Broncos sophomore Jason Seidman to close out the ladder, giving Seidman his sixth consecutive win.
“While we were close in so many of the matches, I think we all were a little nervous and overly excited to play them,” Tao said.

Valentine’s Day is upon is, and that means we’re all thinking about our significant others…and no, not necessarily romantic ones. For all of you who missed out on cuffing season or don't have a bae to fantasize about during the next boring CS lecture, don't forget all those other 'special someones' in your life: roommates, friends, even that 'adorkable' TF. But just because someone is “significant” to you, how do you know those feelings are mutual? And more importantly, when does clingy become too clingy? We've assessed all your non-romantic relationships, and here's what we found.
Friends
Symptoms: You always need to know where they are, in case your life falls apart unexpectedly. You hate it when they talk to other people in the Dhall. Their roommates are asking you to get your stuff out of their common room.
Pros: You never have to eat a meal alone. You never have to be social if you don’t want to be. You have someone to support your stupid ideas and do them with you.
Cons: You probably don’t have any other friends – and you don’t think you need them. You deal with paranoia and friendship jealousy on a daily basis. New friends won’t approach you because they know you’re taken.
Roommates
Symptoms: You make jokes about what they look like without make-up to feel superior to their friends. You have a sign-out whiteboard by the door so you can always know where they are. You feel cheated on when they sleep over with their significant other.
Pros: Your home feels like a home because your roommate is family. You know exactly who to live with next year (and all the years after that). You can share wardrobes.
Cons: You hate knowing that they have friends who live beyond your room. You can’t avoid them if you’re in a fight. Your suitemates can’t stand your late-night giggling.
Professors
Symptoms: You go to office hours every week – and you lie about the location of their office when classmates ask you. You sit in the front row of lecture. They always call on you because you are the only one whose name they know. You have invited them to “Classroom to Table” meals at least once a week.
Pros: You have someone to write future recs. You are probably getting a good grade in the class. You get to spend Harvard’s money on “Classroom to Table” lunch.
Cons: The rest of your class definitely hates you. The prof might also hate you, because they wanted to write a chapter of their new book during office hours. And your TFs might hate you too for being a try hard.
 
Sections
Symptoms: You only study with people from your section. You hate when kids from other sections show up to your class because your TF is better. You organize events unrelated to class, like Ec10b and chill.
Pros: Group work leads to higher grades – there is a lot of research on this. Your pset friends might become actual friends. You always know who to sit with during lecture.
Cons: You are notoriously exclusive. You never bother to meet your future spouse who sits behind you in lecture. You will face the inevitable break-up of the group at the end of the semester.

There are three types of people in the world: those of us who are looking forward to spending Valentine’s Day exclusively with our significant other, those of us who are resigned to and perhaps proud of the fact that we are celebrating the overrated, capitalist holiday with our platonic friends, and those of us who refuse to be romance-less next week and will do whatever it takes to land bae. If you find yourself falling into the last category, here are a few tips on how to find your new boo STAT.
Act Aggressively on Your Harvard Crushes
No matter how big your crushes are, now is the time to flirt aggressively with every single one of them. “Accidentally” run into your crush in the dining hall, spilling all the contents of your tray onto them and dropping all your belongings on the ground. This way, they’ll have to talk to you. Slide into their DMs (we hear that Instagram DMs have the highest success rate). Ask them to grab a meal or study together. It’s okay to seem desperate in this week before V-Day, because you are.
Increase Your Dating App Presence
Download every dating app you’re comfortable with (Tinder, Bumble, eHarmony, IndianDating.com, etc.) and change your settings to be as inclusive as possible—we recommend that you set your age preference at 18 through 65+ and your maximum radius at 250 miles. Once you match with a potential mate—er, date—initiate conversation. Be open-minded, and you might just stumble upon the perfect person.
Get Friends to Set You Up
While they may be bitter that you’d rather scramble to find a random date for the sake of fleeting companionship and your rapidly approaching mid-20s than spend it with the gals or the pals, your friends know your taste in partners best and can easily set you up with someone. Convey your desperation to all your friends and acquaintances, and they’re bound to pity you and find you a V-Day companion.
If Your Exes Don’t Live in Texas…
If the aforementioned strategies don’t end up working, and you’re still bent on finding bae by the 14th, you could always rekindle an old flame (no, not THAT old flame from Opening Days). Who knows, maybe they’re also looking for someone to spend the day with…
Best of luck, and we hope that all of you, regardless of what your plans are, have a good (or at least tolerable) Valentine’s Day. If not, at least there's half-price candy at CVS the following day!

Take a seat. It’s time to talk about the elephant in the room. Yes, Valentine’s Day is coming up, which means you’re either smug about your significant other you snagged during cuffing season, or you’re going through the week trying real hard not to think about your single status. Cry no more, folks, because Datamatch, the Harvard Computer Society’s yearly matchmaking survey, went up on Tuesday this week. If you choose to accept your match, then you get a free date — and how can any of us say no to free food?
All Datamatch asks is that you to fill out a short survey — the questions are all multiple-choice, and, in our expert opinion, pretty funny. HCS puts a lot of stock in their mysterious algorithm, which makes this whole thing sound a lot like an episode of Black Mirror, but let’s try not to think about that. You’ve already wasted hours on Tinder, even after they started ‘prioritizing’ your pictures — um, rude? — so really, how can this hurt you? If you’re in a relationship, Datamatch even has a platonic setting. Freshmen, this is your chance to replace the friends you lose to blocking drama!
If you’re still not sold, you can live vicariously through intrepid Flyby writers, who will be signing up and going on their dates. Feel free to laugh at our awkwardness — just remember, we’re getting a paid-for meal, so who are the real winners here?
