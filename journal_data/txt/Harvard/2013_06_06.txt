After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the calendar hits June every year, hundreds of Harvard students flock 200 miles southwest to the investment banks, cramped NYU dorms, and unsleeping nightlife of New York City. Those lucky enough to spend the summer in the Big Apple also have the opportunity to attend one of the most impressive music festivals in the world: Governors Ball.
The June 7-9 festival on Randall’s Island off Manhattan features an absolutely stacked lineup headlined by Kanye West, Guns N’ Roses, and Kings of Leon. Crimson Arts will run full coverage of the event. Here are five reasons why you should attend, too.
1. Indie Rock Heaven. Pick any set in the middle of the day, and it will probably boast one of 2012’s most critically acclaimed indie outfits: Dirty Projectors, Japandroids, Beach House, Grizzly Bear, Animal Collective, and supergroup Divine Fits. Just wandering around the island, you’ll find intelligent songwriting, intricate arrangements, and irresistible guitar lines at every turn.
2. “I don’t care, I love it.” There are buzz bands galore, but also plenty of guilty pleasures. Icona Pop will perform their mind-numbingly catchy hit “I Love It” to thousands of screaming, dancing fans. Same goes for the Lumineers and “Ho Hey.” And yes, Guns N’ Roses, the Ultimate Band You Love to Hate/Hate to Love, will put their stamp on a raucous weekend with face-melting guitar solos that will rise to the rafters.
3. Past and Future Queens of Hip-Hop. There aren’t many artists as talented, charismatic, stylish, or weird as Erykah Badu and Azealia Banks. Badu was a prominent face of the neo-soul movement in the ’90s and is still putting out incredible, adventurous music with a soulful, throwback style. Banks is a 22-year-old Generation Y leader who has embraced Twitter, electronic dance music production values, and a new breed of feminist hip-hop swag. They represent completely different ideals, yet share the same lineage—cherish the opportunity to catch them both in one weekend.
4. Explore Randall’s Island. In addition to the music, the festival gives you an excuse to check out a unique enclave in a city of cement and steel. The ferry ride provides a spectacular view of the Manhattan skyline, and once you get there, explore the parks, wetlands, bike routes, and the Urban Farm, complete with baby animals to hang out with.
5. The Continuing Saga of Kanye West. Is Kanye West the greatest performer, rapper, producer, and celebrity of our generation? This summer adds a new chapter to his whirlwind career—he’s got both a celeb baby and a new album on the way. His headlining performance at Governors Ball could further magnify his legend—or lead to a meltdown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey and former U.S. Navy SEAL Gabriel E. Gomez, the two men seeking the Commonwealth’s open U.S. Senate seat, traded jabs on a host of issues, spanning from abortion to gun control, in a charged debate Wednesday night at WBZ-TV studios in Allston.
With the election less than three weeks away, Gomez, the Republican whom most observers consider an underdog in the race, was aggressive throughout the night in his attempts to paint Markey, the veteran Democratic congressman from Malden, as a source of gridlock in the Capitol.
The debate was contentious from the beginning, but hottest in its closing minutes, when the candidates were asked about the recent controversies that have embroiled Washington, D.C.
When asked about revelations that the Justice Department monitored the phone records and activities of journalists in a leak probe, Gomez addressed his opponent directly.
“You are basically Washington, D.C. I'm sorry, sir, but you are and that's what the common thread is down there,” Gomez said to Markey. “At the minimum, Attorney General Eric Holder should resign, and at a minimum, I think the President, while he has come out and said the right things, needs to make sure that we have a special investigator outside of the Justice Department get to the bottom of what’s going on.”
Markey, on the other hand, did not address Holder directly, though he did condemn the Justice Department’s actions.
Just a few minutes later, co-moderator Cynthia Needham, political editor for the Boston Globe, turned the debate to abortion. Gomez said he would not oppose a law being considered in various state legislatures, though not yet in Massachusetts, that would require women to wait 24 hours after seeing a physician before having an abortion.
“I’m Catholic, it’s my faith, and I’m personally pro-life,” Gomez said. “I think asking somebody to wait 24 hours before they can actually go and have an abortion is not asking a lot.”
That response drew almost immediate criticism from Markey, who said, “The decision should be between the woman and her physician. That’s it.”
The Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts also rebuked Gomez. In a statement released shortly after the debate, spokesperson Tricia Wajda called Gomez’s support of the 24-hour waiting period “ignorant and dangerous.” Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the organization’s political arm, has endorsed Markey in the race.
Gomez was aggressive from the start of the debate. In her first question of the night, Needham asked the two men if their opponent’s character should be a primary consideration in the race. Gomez, answering first, took the opportunity to suggest that Markey, who has served in Congress since 1976, is a political insider who is out of touch with Massachusetts.
“Congressman Markey, after 37 years in D.C., welcome back to Boston,” Gomez said.
When the discussion turned to gun control, Gomez pounced again. He accused his opponent of making a personal attack in a Markey campaign advertisement that referenced the Newtown, Conn., school shooting in connection with Gomez’s opposition to an assault weapons ban.
“Gomez is against banning high-capacity magazines like the ones used in the Newtown school shooting,”’ the ad said.
Referencing that ad, Gomez told Markey, “You are the first and only political candidate to invoke the Newtown massacre for political gain. That is beyond disgusting.”
For his part, Markey denied that he was trying to link Gomez to Newtown, saying that to do so would be “ridiculous.” But he criticized Gomez for only supporting background check legislation and not a full assault weapons ban.
Calling background checks for a wider range of firearm sales “the minimum” response to gun violence, Markey said that he believed that Massachusetts representatives should lead the way on progressive gun reform.
“We are supposed to be the leader. We know that the assault weapons should be off the streets. We know that high-capacity magazines should be banned,” Markey said to his opponent. “That is a huge difference between what you and I are promising the people of Massachusetts.”
The candidates went on to discuss a wide range of issues. When talk turned to the Affordable Care Act, the massive health care legislation of 2010, Gomez attacked Markey for not voting to repeal the medical device tax, which affects the Commonwealth’s large medical device industry.
“It just tells me that you put party and politics before the people of Massachusetts,” Gomez said of Markey’s nay vote.
Throughout the night, as Gomez continued to try to portray Markey as a firm partisan, Markey defended himself.
“This whole idea that Mr. Gomez is going to be bipartisan and that my basic philosophy isn’t bipartisan is totally wrong,” Markey said at one point.
Before the debate, the scene outside the studio was dominated by Markey supporters, who turned out in droves to wave signs for the Malden congressman.
“Take a look at the support. It’s indicative of also what you’ll find in other places,” one Markey backer, Robin Huer of Weymouth, said in an interview. “It’s just more of a positive thing with the Democratic ticket.”
For Huer, maintaining the momentum of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s victory last November is a primary consideration.
“She’s a rockstar, I campaigned for her,” Huer said of Warren, who is a former Harvard Law School professor. “It’s very crucial. We can’t negate Elizabeth Warren’s vote.”
The special election is slated for June 25. President Barack Obama is scheduled to campaign for Markey in Boston next Wednesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five alumni were elected to Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, the Harvard Alumni Association announced at its annual meeting during Commencement on May 30.
The new members, who will serve six-year terms on the Board, include Susan L. Carney ’73, Christopher B. Field ’75, Deanna J. Lee ’84, Sanjay H. Patel ’83, and Gwill E. York ’79-’80.
The five new members were chosen from a pool of candidates who were nominated by an Alumni Association committee. The election to narrow those candidates down to five new Overseers drew 26,798 ballots submitted by Harvard degree holders.
The Board of Overseers works in conjunction with the Harvard Corporation, Harvard’s highest governing board. The Corporation must obtain the Overseers’ approval for many major decisions, such the appointment of a new University president. With a roster of only 13 members, the Corporation is much smaller than the Board of Overseers, which currently includes 30 members.
The Board of Overseers’s new members, like many of the Overseers, occupy prominent positions in business, law, academia, and other professions. Carney serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Field is an environmental studies professor at Stanford University and founding director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science, Lee is chief communications and digital strategies officer at the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and Patel is a senior partner at Apollo Global Management where he leads the international private equity division.
The fifth new Overseer, York, is a managing director and co-founder of Lighthouse Capital Partners. Though not a member of the Corporation, York already serves on a joint committee on alumni affairs and development that includes 15 members of the two governing boards. Until joining the Board of Overseers, York had served as one of only three members of that committee not on either governing board.
Along with the new Overseers, the Alumni Association announced the election of its six new directors, who will serve three-year terms. Those new directors are Richard R. Buery, Jr., ’92, Patrick S. Chung ’96, Shilla Kim-Parker ’04, Barbara J. Natterson-Horowitz ’83, Julie Gage Palmer ’84, and Argelia M. Rodriguez.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A set of three reports released Thursday by a faculty committee call for a vigorous response to the decline of humanistic study at Harvard, including the establishment of new curricular offerings, an internship program, a new undergraduate humanities center similar to the Harvard Innovation Lab, and a new humanities-minded organization roughly modelled after the Institute of Politics.
The reports also advocate targeting first-year students to help reverse the falling number of humanities concentrators, recommending improved freshman advising and special programming for prospective and incoming students.
Commissioned by divisional dean of arts and humanities Diana Sorensen, the reports are the product of 18 months of research and reflection by a collection of faculty in the arts and humanities division working as part of the Humanities Project, a division-wide initiative.
The longest report, entitled “Mapping the Future,” begins by analyzing the history of humanistic study at Harvard. Over the past 60 years, the report says, the percentage of humanities concentrators at the College has declined from 24 to 17 percent, mirroring a downward trend nationwide.
The report also sets forth goals for the future of the humanities at Harvard, including greater interdisciplinary collaboration across divisions and increased publicity of the myriad of job prospects that potentially await humanities concentrators.
A second report, the proposal of a working group focused on curricular innovation, discusses the addition of new “gateway” courses that will aim to draw student interest early on in their careers. These new courses will include three introductory humanities courses—“The Art of Listening,” “The Art of Reading,” and “The Art of Looking”—set to launch in the upcoming academic year, as well as a year-long humanities survey course for freshmen and sophomores in the works for the 2014-2015 school year.
The proposal also cites the need for more integrated freshman seminars and improved curricular collaboration within the division itself.
The third report, written by Homi Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, discusses the Center’s role as a common ground for faculty and students of all arts and humanities disciplines.
In a letter introducing the documents, Sorensen wrote that while the reports signal an important step forward for the humanities, revitalizing interest in humanistic learning will require further work.
“These reports...provide a sturdy foundation on which to base our future efforts,” Sorensen wrote. “Though varied in tack and emphasis, these efforts share a common goal: the collective assertion of the humanities as an essential foundational element in American liberal arts education.”
