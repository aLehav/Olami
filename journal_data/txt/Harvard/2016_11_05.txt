After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“No red tape, Doctor. We’re pairing the most brilliant minds in medicine with the most brilliant minds in technology, and we’re going to take out the middleman. We’re going to get stuff done. This is the revolution, Dr. Wallace,” promises young Silicon Valley billionaire James Bell (Augustus Prew) to the infamous surgeon Dr. Walter Wallace (Dermot Mulroney) in the pilot of CBS’s “Pure Genius”. Though the pilot sets up an exciting premise, it fails to impress because its highly implausible plot feels over the top and ridiculous.
This new series created by Jason Katims and Sarah Watson focuses on the opening of a new hospital called Bunker Hill (funded by Bell) in Palo Alto. Bunker Hill is a revolutionary hospital at which patients receive the most advanced medical care at no cost. The opening scene uses flashbacks to piece together the story of Wallace, who was fired from his job as a surgeon for trying to save a cancer patient using a non-FDA approved drug. Bell admires this dedication and decides to hire him as his new chief of staff.
From the start, the audience is dazzled by an array of flitting computer screens that project patients’ blood pressure, MRI scans, CAT scans, and a wide variety of other unlikely medical information. The hospital even contains a beautiful Japanese zen garden with a waterfall where patients can meditate amongst the flora and fauna, begging the most important question of all: Why does this hospital look like a yoga retreat? Ultimately, Bell’s world of technology and the hospital itself are too ridiculously over the top to be believable, best exemplified perhaps by the ability of one doctor to wave a glowing scanner/iPad over a woman’s growing womb and instantly generate an ultrasound of the baby across a screen.
Prew plays Bell in a fanciful manner reminiscent of Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock Holmes, but unfortunately his acting cannot save his character. Bell is as unbelievable as the glowing iPad, promising all the patients long life and good health despite his lack of a medical background. His interest in Dr. Zoe Brockett (Odette Annable) seems to play into the clichéd bantering relationships of many medical dramas, promising very little new material in that direction. The character of Wallace is also problematic because of how little he is fleshed out. Considering he’s one of the main characters, it seems bizarre that we know so little about him besides his incredible work ethic and mesmerizing surgery skills—apparently so impressive that when he practices removing a tumor from a model heart, the whole office will gather to around to watch while eating popcorn.
Besides its absurd and improbable elements, the show does not seem to bring anything new, despite its array of Silicon Valley gadgets. Though the plotlines are not totally egregious, they are not particularly captivating either. We are left with a “revolution” that falls drastically short of expectation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team dominated the start of its ECAC opener Friday night. But the scoreboard presented a dissenting opinion.
Despite outshooting visiting Colgate, 18-2, over the first 20 minutes, the No. 12/12 Crimson left the Bright-Landry ice at the end of period one trailing, 1-0. And Harvard’s frustration would only continue to mount.
The Crimson doubled the Raiders’ shot totals in each of the next two frames, but Colgate—led by senior goaltender Charlie Finn—continued to hold the Harvard offense at bay. Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot salvaged a 1-1 tie courtesy of a power-play equalizer with 7:08 left to play, but the story of the contest was the Crimson’s problems translating puck possession into production.
Harvard’s territorial advantage was largely evident in 5-on-5 play—and the shot count reflected it—but with the Crimson (2-0-1, 0-0-1 ECAC) drawing seven man advantages to Colgate’s three, the possession battle only grew increasingly lopsided. Yet, Harvard’s power play unit—which ranked fifth in the nation a season ago—came up empty on its first six attempts.
But the seventh time was a charm. Midway through a Jake Kulevich holding penalty, the Crimson’s top special teams unit finally broke through. Drifting in front of the net after winning a draw, Kerfoot—who admitted he’s ‘usually not too good’ from that very spot—managed to tip home rookie defenseman Adam Fox’s blue-line wrister to even the score at one.
The conversion provided Harvard’s special teams unit with something to feel good about, but moving forward, Kerfoot said he’d like to see the power play move the puck a bit quicker.
“It’s going to take time,” Kerfoot said. “It’s the [third] game of the season, and we’ve got a pretty new unit put together right now. It’s one game, and I don’t think that’s going to define our season.”
Theorizing what went wrong on the man advantage, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said when a goalie gets hot, guys often become too selective with their shots, thinking they need to generate the ‘perfect’ attempt to have a chance of scoring. That theory checked out on Friday, as the Crimson hardly threw any pucks on net that led to second-chance opportunities against Finn, who made 41 saves—two shy of his career high.
“He has shown in the past he can get hot and steal a game,” Donato said. “It was something we actually talked about this morning, so I don’t think we were surprised. But I’d be lying if I didn’t say we weren’t a little frustrated.”
“I haven’t seen him find a puck like he did tonight,” Colgate coach Don Vaughan said. “He was finding a lot of pucks through traffic, and when he’s doing that, he’s really on his game.”
Finn finished one bounce shy of a clean sheet, which would have earned the Raiders (1-3-4, 0-0-1) their second win of the season. For a while, freshman defenseman Ross Craig looked like he might have provided Colgate with all the offense it would need 10:12 into the first period when his blue-line blast bounced off the glove of junior goaltender Merrick Madsen and in.
But ultimately, Kerfoot would equalize in period three, setting up a thrilling finish to regulation. Seconds after Madsen stoned sophomore Hunter Racine on a breakaway along the wing with 1:40 remaining, Finn returned the favor, denying sophomore forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage’s dangerous wrister in transition with his right pad.
And down the ice the Raiders went again. The Crimson counter quickly gave way to a Colgate one, as freshman Jared Cockrell rushed up the left wing and fired a shot that Madsen had to scramble to stop.
Chaos ensued as the rookie went sliding into the goal. The puck slowly rolled outside the blue paint to freshman Tyler Penner, and with Madsen out of position, the rookie likely could have picked his spot; but instead he one-timed a shot that sailed wide of the half-empty net, allowing Harvard to escape the danger.
“I thought we had a pretty good third period,” Vaughan said. “I thought we battled hard, we got some opportunities, and we could’ve stole a win on the road against a very good team.”
Both teams generated opportunities in the five-minute overtime period but none better than those of the wild final two minutes of regulation. By game’s end, the shot count read, 42-15, in favor of the Crimson.
