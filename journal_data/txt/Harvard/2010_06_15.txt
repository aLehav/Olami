After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, the Harvard men’s soccer team watched as its former coach, John Kerr, left for what seemed to be a better offer—his alma mater, Duke. Flash-forward to the 2009 season, when the Crimson earned an NCAA tournament seed half that of the Blue Devils’ (10 to Duke’s 20), and Harvard seemed to have gotten the better end of the deal.
But this offseason, the Crimson suffered a case of déjà vu.
Harvard coach Jamie Clark led the team to its highest NCAA finish in recent years when it advanced the Sweet 16, but the second-year man announced yesterday that he is departing to take on the head coaching position at Creighton University.
Now Harvard must hope that success will come just as quickly with its third coach in four years.
“It’s unfortunate, because coach Clark really fit in with our program,” rising co-captain Jaren LaGreca said. “At the same time, what’s done is done. Our responsibility is to make sure that we’re focused as a team and make sure we’re focused in the right way.”
Despite riding at the center of a coaching carousel, LaGreca and the rest of the rising seniors have still managed to ride their way to NCAA tournament berths in each of their three seasons with the Crimson.
“I think it’s rare that this happens to a class,” LaGreca said. “We still had success. Even though we’re going to have a coaching change, I’m positive that we’ll still be successful.”
When Clark came to Cambridge, he inherited a team that had reached the NCAA tournament the year prior, a luxury he will not have at his new post. In the 2009 season, Creighton finished fourth in its conference and failed to make the dance, though the Bluejays knocked off defending national champion Virginia, 2-1, in an exhibition game this spring.
“I had an incredible experience at Harvard and it took a very special opportunity to pull me away," Clark told the Creighton athletics website. "It is a great honor to take over the Creighton men's soccer program. It is one of the premier places for soccer in the college game.”
Meanwhile, Harvard will take the field in 2010 aiming for a fifth straight berth to NCAAs, led by a senior class familiar with change.
“I think we’ve been prepared,” LaGreca said. “We have high expectations.”
Those expectations will greet whoever appears on the sideline this fall as the Crimson’s head coach.
“We’re just antsy to find out who our new coach is going to be,” LaGreca said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling just one match short of an Ivy League championship in 2010, the Harvard men’s tennis team will look to take the next step forward under the new leadership of rising seniors Aba Omodele-Lucien and Alexei Chijoff-Evans, who will take on the role as the team’s co-captains next season.
With a stronger emphasis on fitness and a renewed focus, the co-captains hope the team will have what it takes to capture the Ancient Eight championship, which has eluded the Crimson since 2008.
“We’re going to do a lot of extra work—just putting in the time and the necessary sacrifices, especially in the fitness aspect,” Omodele-Lucien said. “We’re going to make our team run a lot more.”
Omodele-Lucien and Chijoff-Evans take over for Michael Hayes ’10, who, despite not playing much of a role on the court for the Crimson, captained the team during his senior season.
“Unlike last year, the captains are going to be much more heavily involved because of how much they’ll be playing,” rising sophomore Christo Schultz said. “It’ll be a lot easier to listen to what they say and do what they say. It’ll be a lot easier to relate to them.”
As juniors, Omodele-Lucien and Chijoff-Evans each played crucial roles in helping the Crimson finish tied for second in the Ancient Eight with a 5-2 conference record.
Omodele-Lucien split time between the No. 2 and No. 3 spots, closing out the season with back-to-back singles victories and an overall doubles record of 21-10.
“He is one of the hardest workers on the team by a long shot,” said Schultz, who partnered with Omodele-Lucien for most of the season. “He’s extremely passionate about tennis. He’s just passionate about everything he does.”
Chijoff-Evans, who shared team-MVP honors with sophomore Andy Nguyen, played at the No. 1 spot throughout the season, finishing with an overall record of 19-12, earning him a spot on All-Ivy First Team in singles for the second time.
“He’s an unbelievable tennis player—one of the most naturally gifted tennis players I’ve ever seen,” Schultz said.
But despite their individual talents, Chijoff-Evans and Omodele-Lucien will rely heavily on their younger teammates to help the team reach its goals.
Luckily for the co-captains, the rest of the Harvard squad is not too shabby. The team returns its entire starting lineup, including two All-Ivy doubles squads.
“No matter what, I always have faith in our team winning the Ivy League championship,” Omodele-Lucien said. “I think our chances are pretty high.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Yale ended the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s season, graduating Crimson midfielder Jason Duboe thought he might be hanging up his stick for good. But it turned out that the two-time NEILA All New England first-team selection wasn’t finished playing lacrosse. On June 6, the Boston Cannons selected Duboe with the 33rd overall pick in the Major League Lacrosse draft.
“I honestly wasn’t sure if I’d ever be able to play lacrosse at a highly competitive level again,” Duboe said. “I was really pleasantly surprised when the Cannons drafted me. I’m really grateful for the opportunity. It was definitely a surprise on June 6 when the draft day came.”
Duboe joins a talented Cannons squad that includes Paul Rabil. The 2008 Johns Hopkins graduate was named the MLL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year in his rookie season after winning two National Championships and earning three All-America honors at Hopkins.
“The draft class is very talented and it will certainly be tough to crack the roster,” Duboe said. “I had earned my stripes over four years [in college]. Now I’m playing with some of the most talented players in the world. I’m just trying to contribute in any way possible. The pace is a lot faster. The athletes are a lot bigger and stronger. The overall level of talent at every position is as high as it can possibly be.”
Also new to the Boston squad is a former college rival, Max Quinzani, who capped his college career at Duke with a national championship. In 2009, Harvard upset the then No. 5 Blue Devils before falling to them 14-5 this year during Duke’s national championship run. But according to Duboe, the recent history between the schools hasn’t led to any bitterness between him and his new Cannons teammate.
“We joke around with each other,” Duboe said. “He’s on a different level…It’s great to see that he has had a lot of success.”
But while the new pro adjusts to new teammates, new coaches, and a new level of play, he won’t have to adjust to a new field because the Cannons play at Harvard Stadium. Home field is just about the only thing staying the same for the former Crimson midfielder, but for Duboe a few adjustments is a small price to pay to keep playing lacrosse.
“I’m just out there to help the team in any way I can,” Duboe said. “I already sense that there’s a great deal of camaraderie."
