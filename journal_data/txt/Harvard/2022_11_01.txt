After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Issa Rae’s HBO Max comedy series “Rap Sh!t,” Miami-based rapper Mia Knight (Alju Koby Jackson aka KaMillion) challenges the condemnation of female rappers who embrace their sexuality. She says to fellow rapper Shawna Clark (Aida Osman), “We’re in the middle of a Bad Bitch Renaissance. Have some fun.”
When Shawna replies insisting that she wants to resist the male gaze and stimulate listeners intellectually, Mia’s response is a startling yet pointed articulation of the Black woman’s paradox: To receive respect Black women must express intellect and practice “polite” mannerisms, but to secure success Black women must sexualize or simplify themselves.
“You lettin’ these niggas control you! You’re saying that there’s no way that a Black girl can have fun and be winning?” she retaliates.
Reflecting on this scene, I realized that the debate between the rap duo is emblematic of a greater discussion about misogynoir and respectability politics — and similar commentary pervades other comedy shows created by Issa Rae like “Insecure” and “The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl.”
In “Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880-1920,” Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, a professor of African American Studies at Harvard University, coined the term "politics of respectability" to characterize the work of the Women's Convention of the Black Baptist Church during the Progressive Era. She specifically referenced the push within Black American communities for temperance, cleanliness of person and property, thrift, polite manners, and sexual purity to achieve social equity. The politics of respectability called for "reform of individual behavior as a goal in itself and as a strategy for reform."
Respectability was a key component of racial uplift ideology in the era of “the Negro Problem” which persisted from roughly the 1880s to 1914. It had two audiences: Black Americans, who were encouraged to act respectably, and white people, who needed proof that Black Americans could be respectable.
Black elites like W.E.B. Du Bois, Class of 1890, and Booker T. Washington reinforced this rhetoric by declaring that Black intellectuals must reform the character of the community (Du Bois) and that education would lead to societal acceptance (Washington). This endorsement of respectability further validated anti-Black stereotypes by echoing the dominant perception of Black Americans as culturally depraved and backward.
When “the Negro Problem” era ended, respectability didn’t exit society alongside it. Respectability politics continue to govern society and remain especially harmful for Black women who additionally experience misogynoir, a term conceptualized by feminist scholar Moya Bailey, which describes the juncture between the racist and misogynist oppression Black women experience.
Respectability and misogynoir shape the way television writers write Black women. Portrayals of Black women as sassy side characters like Helen (Yvette Nicole Brown) on “Drake & Josh” or angry agitators like Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) on “Scandal” are manifestations of both concepts, as they imply that Black women are only needed as comedic relief or are inherently aggressive — a remnant of the Brute Caricature myth which asserted that Black people are innately savage and deserving of punishment. The reliance on these stereotypes in popular shows damagingly encourages reductive perceptions of Black women.
Showrunners like Shonda Rhimes also cater to the confines of traditional respectability by only depicting Black women as “professional” and powerful individuals. Despite any good intentions, this is far from a revolutionary demonstration of Black feminism or diverse representation. Instead of subverting stereotypes surrounding Black women, this depiction affirms the misconception that Black people must achieve a certain social status to be worthy of media representation and respect, resembling the beliefs of Booker T. Washington.
But as a Black woman who grew up glued to the television screen, I wonder, is there still value to this misrepresentation? Should you be grateful to look like a character even if you do not recognize yourself or your community in that character?
My reckoning with representation is filled with concessions and negotiations — and I will contend with my complicated relationship to the Black women characters who shaped my childhood throughout this column. However, in this installment, I’ll discuss why Issa Rae’s work replaces my disillusionment with hope.
Consider Mia Knight and Shawna Clark of Issa Rae’s newest show “Rap Sh!t.” Their debate about professionalism, sexual agency, commercialism, and body reclamation is representative of something all too rare in television: explorations of the inner workings of a Black woman’s mind. Externalizing Black women’s internal thoughts and intellectual identity is something television writers rarely dare to do. And, on the occasion that writers endeavor to do so, the woman is always an “outlier” within the Black community: Positioned as uniquely smart, strikingly focused, professional, exceptional, respectable.
But Issa Rae isn’t consumed by exceptionalism — she writes about people that you know and love. Mia is a single mother and aspiring rapper who works as a makeup artist and OnlyFans creator. Shawna works as a hotel attendant during the day and writes lyrics at night. Both women are in their early 20s and neither hold a college degree.
Black women — beyond those typically deemed “professional” — are not usually depicted as multidimensional people evolving in their understanding of blackness, engaging in intellectual conversations, and rejecting respectability, so the inclusion of Mia and Shawna indicates a cultural shift towards accurate representation. Because, truthfully, how often do you see a character from the projects depicted with dignity or dimensionality? How many television shows quickly reduce young, poor Black women hustlers to “hoodrats?”
“Rap Sh!t” is not concerned with racial uplift or respectability. It is a refreshingly real representation of the absurdities and contradictions of being an aspiring rapper, of survival, Miami, and girls from the hood. But it never belittles or diminishes the characters for their circumstances, ambitions, persona, or actions.
Issa Rae’s older shows, “Insecure” and “The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl,” are equally defiant and revolutionary. Both disrupt and dismantle stereotypes surrounding Black women's emotions through comedy. Issa Dee (Issa Rae), a character on “Insecure” and a semi-autobiographical version of Issa Rae, navigates her insecurities, anxieties, struggles, and job frustrations through freestyle mirror confessional raps that are introspective yet hilarious.
We watch Issa Dee face frequent microaggressions at her job at a predominantly white-led community-based youth organization, navigate romantic relationships, and ride alongside her as she spends her nights working as a Lyft driver. Issa Rae’s authentic depiction of awkward everyday life offers viewers a unique insight into the psyche of a Black woman figuring it all out.
Mainstream media generally refuses to cover the awkward, insecure, and anxious Black woman, and this exclusion upholds the Strong Black Woman archetype which describes Black women as selfless, emotionally-restrained, self-reliant, and unwaveringly resilient. This strips Black women of their right to be human and respond to harm. The Strong Black Woman archetype or “superwoman schema” is confronted by Issa Rae with care and complexity. She realizes that to be Black, introverted, and anxious is considered contradictory. But she knows that this is a common combination in real life, and that Black women are entitled to a space where their insecurities and discomforts are intimately explored, hilariously captured, and socially normalized.
In Issa Rae’s work, Black women move from the margin to the center; her characters reclaim their sexuality, embrace vulnerability, welcome growth, face anxiety, and express their individuality. Because of Issa Rae and the Black women creators who preceded her, television includes Black women characters who exist beyond stereotypical or palatable personas like the angry, sassy, or “professional” Black woman.
She does not exclude the hustling mom, the sex worker, the aspiring rapper, the youth worker, the awkward girl, or all the other beatifully complex forms a Black woman can come in which are oftentimes disregarded by television writers. Instead, Issa Rae reimagines representation and writes a world where Black women are free from the restraints of respectability.

Kishoiyian’s column, “If You’re Not Invited to the Party, Throw Your Own: Sitcoms on Black Womanhood Written by Black Women” aspires to capture, commend, and critique sitcoms centering Black womanhood while emphasizing the diversity, dimensionality, and dignity of the creators and characters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 2019 Netflix Film “Always Be My Maybe,” Marcus (Randall Park) tells Sasha (Ali Wong), the celebrity chef slash love interest in the midst of opening an upscale Asian restaurant, “Asian food shouldn't be served in a shot glass. It should be served in a big-ass bowl. You're just catering to rich white people.” It’s a statement that creates the tropey pre-happy-ending conflict, but it’s a loaded one: It references the history of Asian food in America and complicates the ever-growing conversation on cultural appropriation in the gastronomical world.
According to Krishnendu Ray, a professor of Food Studies at New York University, "American exposure to Chinese food has mostly been cheap Chinese food." This phenomenon has everything to do with the history of Chinese immigration to the United States. With a wave of Chinese railroad laborers in the 1860s, there was a demand for inexpensive, affordable Chinese food, particularly because these Chinese laborers were paid two-thirds what their white counterparts were. According to Yong Chen, the customers that helped introduce Chinese food into the Western mainstream following a boom in Chinese restaurant owners in the 1930s were, interestingly, also of marginalized communities: “bohemians, African Americans, and immigrants like Jews from Eastern Europe” provided the constant customers that sustained these businesses. Chinese American food has historically been marketed as inexpensive fare. Indian food, too, has historically been viewed as cheap in America: With an influx of Indian restaurants opening in the 1950s in major American cities, chefs chose to focus on the “British-ized version of Indian food,” and Indian food in America thus became defined by an incredibly narrow selection of (primarily North Indian) dishes: vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, naan. The lack of appreciation for the complexities of Indian food, which often has multiple ingredients and hours of prep time but is still expected to be affordable, has stunted the growth of Indian food in America. A history of labeling Asian food as affordable has led to an expectation of Asian food being inexpensive today, personified in the iconoclastic Chinese takeout box we see today — convenient, simple, cheap.
Perhaps this historical context, along with the lived realities of current times, explain the increasingly heated accusations about cultural appropriation of Asian food. As violence against AAPI people spiked, a protest sign went viral: “Love our people like you love our food.” Throughout the centuries, there’s been a shift from rejecting Asian food as “other” to discovering it as a culinary novelty. The popularization of previously maligned Asian practices is not unique to cuisine — it’s reflected in the adoption of yoga (which originated in the Vedic period in North India over 5,000 years ago) and martial arts (“Karate Kid,” anyone?) to the Western mainstream. Yet the disingenuity between the appreciation of Asian culture and the apparent apathy towards the injustices being directed towards the people whose cultures are being enjoyed understandably creates a sense of anger. It should come as no surprise, then, that watching non-Asian people adopt, and then profit off, the very same food that Asians have previously been mocked for, touches a nerve. Worse still, when white people take it upon themselves to “improve” and “modernize” Asian cuisine — like when Karen Taylor, a white woman, dubbed herself the Queen of Congee and began selling apple cinnamon and mango and sticky rice flavored versions of the traditionally savory Asian rice porridge.
To be clear, the problem is not in being inspired by other cultures, but rather, recognizing, in chef Christine Nguyen’s words, that “we cannot talk about cultural appreciation of another ethnicity’s food without talking about how these communities remain underappreciated in very practical and systemic ways.” It’s about acknowledging the simplification and denigration of Indian food and how it shaped the way Indian children felt about their identities. It’s about realizing that the boom in Chinese restaurants in the 1930s came about because Chinese immigrants, finding a loophole in anti-immigration laws that allowed Chinese restaurant owners to receive special merchant visas, began opening Chinese restaurants.
It’s interesting to compare this America-centric debate to the conversations going on elsewhere in the world. In Southeast Asia, the debates about the origins of certain foods are fierce and frequent; Singaporeans and Malaysians most recently were engaged in a heated debate about who could claim hawker food as part of their national identity when Singapore registered hawker culture with UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage. As histories and cultures collide throughout history, it is unavoidable that what is considered “authentic” will be questioned. But that is beside the point: The global history of colonization, arbitrary borders, and shifting country lines means that there will always be a grappling with the “authenticity” of food. Instead, the debate must be shifted to how there is an inherent power structure when those from the majority group begin borrowing — and then profiting off — a minority group. There is a clear economic disparity created when white chefs begin “elevating” Asian food and marketing it as upscale, ignorant of the history behind the affordability of such cuisines. Perhaps it's wiser to let Asian chefs take the lead in reversing this phenomenon, because it’s also about reclaiming Asian American narratives] and dispelling the idea that Asian food is only good for its affordability. The practice can instead be about Asian Americans knowing their own worth and having the prices they charge reflect that worth. Maybe Eddie Huang, BaoHaus owner, said it best. “My name is Eddie Huang. I was born in America, my ancestors are from China, and my parents were born in Taiwan... I sell Taiwanese gua bao for a full fucking price in America.”
Back to “Always Be My Maybe.” Maybe Sasha is not entirely wrong in trying to create upscale Asian cuisine — she simply is fighting against a history that has made such a concept near-unheard of. Ultimately, the debate surrounding the cultural appropriation of Asian food is not about whether the food created is delicious or authentic. Instead, we should be looking at how the inherent power structures existing in American society prevent Asian chefs from truly profiting off the food from their own culture, and the hypocrisy of how those in more privileged positions can alter such foods and then benefit.

It is said that cornrows braided on the heads of the enslaved often held maps to navigate the Underground Railroad. In many ways, hair still holds this power of freedom. Hulu’s new series “The Hair Tales,” executive produced by Oprah Winfrey, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Michaela Angela Davis, premiered its first two episodes on Oct. 22. The series follows actress Tracee Ellis Ross as she interviews prominent Black women — Oprah Winfrey, Issa Rae, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, Chlöe Bailey, CHIKA, and Marsai Martin — about their relationships with their hair. Ross recognizes that the aim of her show may be lost to some. “It can feel like it’s just a conversation about hair,” she says, “But it’s not. Especially not for Black women.”
The first two episodes feature Oprah Winfrey and Issa Rae, respectively. Ross’s one-on-one interviews with her two guests are interspersed with clips of Black women getting their hair done in a salon and having conversations with each other and their stylists about Black hair and community. These scenes are beautifully integrated into the show’s overarching dialogue about hair and sisterhood, as the women share their individual experiences and find commonalities amidst the combing, twisting, and braiding of the salon.
In response to Ross’s insightful questions, Winfrey and Rae share moments in their lives when their hair was a source of trauma. In a tear-jerking scene, Winfrey, who refers to her hair as her “crown and glory,” recalls being sent to New York by her boss to “fix” her hair, as it was “too thick” and was interfering with their technical ability to portray her on the news. “It didn’t even occur to me that it was racial,” she says, “I thought I just wasn’t pretty enough.” For too many Black women, experiences such as this are common and relatable. Watching an iconic figure such as Oprah Winfrey be open and vulnerable about her own hair trauma is both touching and empowering — for those with crowns and for those without them.
Alongside these stories of trauma, however, are stories of joy. Rae reflects on the versatility of Black hair, and the ways in which it can tell the story of a person’s life. She remembers the gratification of realizing that her hair could be a medium for expression and liberation. “There’s a specific validation of just being and living in you,” she says. The women in the salon scenes echo this sentiment, laughing and smiling as they describe the unparalleled elegance and grace they feel when they know their hair looks good. Despite the fact that trauma is ever-present in the hair stories of many Black women, “The Hair Tales” does a commendable job of displaying the joy that inevitably shines through.
“Every kink, curl, and coil in a Black woman’s crown has a hair tale,” narrates Ross at the beginning of every episode. By sharing their stories, Winfrey and Rae invite viewers to join them in their reflection of what their hair means to them. Additionally, the inclusion of historical details about how Black women’s hair has evolved over the centuries solidifies the idea that for Black women, hair is never just hair. Trauma, joy, and freedom are entangled in every Black woman's curls — and Ross asks all the right questions to create a safe space for Black women everywhere to be vulnerable and heard.
The first two episodes of “The Hair Tales” are immensely promising and viewers everywhere should be excited for what’s to come.

Claire K. Yoo ’23 and Charlotte J. Daniels ’23 want to make sure that one point is on record: Their “dream is to make people happy.”
For them, the way to achieve their dream is through the Harvard College Stand-up Comic Society (commonly referred to as HCSUCS, and jokingly pronounced “HC sucks”) — an open community of stand-up comedians who host regular performances, jam sessions, and workshops. HCSUCS is open to everyone, and provides a space for anyone who is interested in stand-up to stop by, listen, or, as Yoo puts it, “riff, as the industry lingo goes…”
Yoo and Daniels, who served as co-presidents for the previous calendar year, both found HCSUCS early on in their Harvard experience. “I had no intention of doing stand-up comedy before college,” Yoo said. However, upon meeting Daniels through an improv group, she was convinced to try it out. “And so I went to a meeting. And it was just a spiral effect. It's just so fun to be around funny people for an hour and a half every week, and just be silly,” she said.
Yoo has continued with stand-up ever since. As Daniels put it, “Now she’s a star. One of the brightest.”
Daniels also attended an early HCSUCS meeting in her freshman year, but was easily convinced to come back. “It was super awkward for me, but I just thought, ‘oh my God,’ all these people are so funny. They’re so cool and attractive. Everyone was so hot, and so I thought, ‘gotta come back,’” she said.
Current co-presidents, Ian S. Kimbell ’23 and Dylan R. Roy ’23, joined HCSUCS because they wanted to continue their involvement in comedy, but in a different way than in high school. “I liked the idea of doing stand-up for a while, but I’m from Indiana. There's not much to do with that. But I did speech competitions in high school, and so I put some jokes in there,” Kimbell said. “I wanted to do a pure joke. And so I got here and saw that this club existed. So that's how I joined.”
When Roy heard about the stand-up club in his freshman fall, he jumped ship from more theatrical-based organizations and joined, too.
A main attraction of HCSUCS for both sets of co-presidents was its inclusivity. “We know what it feels like to be part of a very small, maybe difficult to join part of comedy,” Yoo said. “A big part of what's so great about stand-up is that it really is truly open to everyone.”
“There's no audition, no nothing,” Kimbell added. “So you can come in. And once you come to your first meeting, you're on the same level, you can sign up to pitch as much material as anyone else.” HCSUCS hosts about two shows per month, and is committed to incorporating new voices into all performances. “We had the ‘Fresh Faces’ show recently, which is a yearly show, where we get people who are new to stand-up. So whether they're freshmen or seniors or even grad students, just try their hand at stand-up,” Roy said. “A lot of people who go have a really good time.
HCSUCS’s emphasis on being an open club has a large impact on the overall community and satisfaction of its members. “These are all people who are here in this room together every week, because we just enjoy laughing and being silly,” Yoo said. “And when you have that as the mission statement of a group, then it's just gonna be fun, and supportive, and you're never gonna feel like, ‘Oh, am I stupid?’ Because everyone's stupid, we're all stupid.”
The fun is not supposed to be limited to the members. A connection with the audience and the ability to engage them is crucial. “It's always been fun to perform here. Harvard's just like a serious place. Most people at Harvard want to laugh at some point,” Yoo said.
Although the group has had many fun performances and club meetings, there are moments that clearly stand out.
“One thing that I did last year was a normal stand-up, but with the central concept, that one of my hands was stuck in a peanut butter jar,” Kimbell said, to his and Roy’s laughter. “It was very funny. I later revealed that my other hand was stuck in a jar of wipes. And then at the end I revealed that my leg was stuck in a jar of cheese balls.”
Daniels’s favorite performance took place during the Quad show.
“One of the specific jokes that I had just written like 20 minutes before got a really big laugh. And I was so happy. It was just so nice that something that I had just written made people happy,” Daniels said. “I guess that's the dream. To make people happy.”

It’s official. Spooky season has arrived. For many, the most joyous part of the season comes in brightly colored wrappers. Gluttonous candy consumption is a hallmark of this holiday, and nothing kills the spooky spirit like receiving a toothbrush at a neighbor’s door. Candy choice can be contentious: Sweet or sour? Nuts or caramel? Marshmallow or coconut? This article is not a trick. Here are The Crimson’s top 10 Halloween treats.
10. Almond Joy
Coming in at number 10 on this list is the gleefully hated Almond Joy. Though definitely underrated, the combination of compressed coconut and almond, topped with a thin layer of chocolate has never quite satiated the Halloween candy craving. It almost feels too fancy? Good thing there’s usually a stray adult around to eat these frequent leftovers.
9. Skittles
Skittles are a pretty decent choice, especially for the rare trick-or-treaters who dislike chocolate. Their bright colors and citrussy flavors stand out among the more common candies. The diminutive size makes them perfect for snacking. Watch out, though, these are liable to yank a tooth out with their tough, chewy texture.
8. Snickers
Snickers, despite being a staple candy in the trick-or-treater’s repository, can be controversial, not only because they contain peanuts (beware of allergens lurking in your basket), but because the combination of caramel, peanuts, and chocolate is not a universally appealing one. The crunchy peanuts and the smooth caramel congeal to the enamels in a sticky-salty-sweet mess. Tasty, but not the most enjoyable experience.
7. Candy Corn
Candy Corn is the most underrated candy out there. Is it the best? Not by a long shot. But there is a solid case for candy corn. No candy is more festive. No candy is more easily and absentmindedly snacked on. And lastly, this is the only candy for which a generic, grocery store brand is acceptable, even hailed. If you want to snub Mars this Halloween, buy (and relish) candy corn.
6. Butterfingers
What the heck is a Butterfinger? This mind-bending, crunchy, peanutty, chocolate wonder has the most confusing and satisfying texture of all the candies. The aerated, candied peanut butter is completely unique, deliciously flakey, and simply a joy to consume. Crumbs will abound, so the elaborately costumed might want to avoid this one.
5. M&Ms
At this point, M&Ms are a cultural touchstone. Mars, the producer of M&Ms, recently unveiled a new “spokescandy” for the brand, the purple M&M. It joins the ranks of several beloved M&M personalities, like Green and Brown, and purportedly represents inclusivity, since it is the only female peanut M&M in Mars’s anthropomorphised candy marketing scheme. Several right-wing publications ridiculed the company, stating that the purple M&M (a genderless piece of chocolate) is “trans” and “identifies as a skittle.” Aside from political and social value, of which M&Ms have a surprising amount, the actual taste of standard, fun-sized M&Ms is classic, but somewhat boring. Smooth chocolate with a candy exterior is tasty, but it lacks the excitement that this holiday requires.
4. Twix
Though the left-Twix, right-Twix debate has many candy connoisseurs bewildered, Twix are objectively a great candy. The perfect mix of smooth caramel and shortbread, enveloped in rich chocolate, never disappoints. Twix are a great, reliable candy, though the cookie can make the experience of eating somewhat dry, and the caramel remains a reliable treat when found in the crevices of your teeth several days later.
3. Heath Bars
Heath Bars are amazing, and they somehow never get enough hype. Toffee is exceptional (and devilishly sticky), with nutty flavors undercutting the sweetness. The crunch is amazing, and the melt-in-your mouth chocolate rounds out the experience. Heath Bars are delicious and criminally underrated.
2. Trolli Sour Crawlers
The runner-up in this list is Trolli Sour Crawlers. Perfectly sweet and sour, with a satisfying gummy texture, these worms are the best non-chocolate choice. Each two-toned worm combines two flavors for double the deliciousness. Sour Crawlers are fan-favorites and are highly addictive. The neon packaging adds an extra aesthetic bonus to this already superb Halloween choice.
1. Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups
The best Halloween candy is Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. You know them, and you most likely love them. Packaged in orange, yellow, and brown, they were practically made for this holiday. Sweet and smooth peanut butter and thick chocolate is a marriage for the ages. Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are classic and timeless, delicious, simple, and yet still exciting. They are the perfect Halloween treat.

At first glance, gossip, betrayal, and seduction seem like enticing cinematic material. But Karen Maine’s “Rosaline” proves that a juicy plot cannot save a film that lacks bold artistic vision. Based on a young adult novel by Rebecca Serle called “When You Were Mine” and Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” “Rosaline” fails to capture the vivacity of young love it set out to portray.
The film follows Rosaline, the cousin of Juliet, adjacent to the traditional Shakespearean “Romeo and Juliet” plot. She drives Juliet’s well-known storyline from the outskirts with her own love story. Rebellious and unimpressed by the patriarchy’s expectations, Rosaline bemoans arranged marriage, like many young adult heroines, instead prioritizing a love match. After losing her initial suitor, Romeo, to her cousin, Rosaline finds herself drawn to Dario, whom she initially disliked. Embracing a typical enemies-to-lovers plotline, “Rosaline” had loads of exciting potential as a story.
Despite an admirable performance by Kaitlyn Dever as Rosaline, the film’s cast mainly appears as a two-dimensional ensemble. With a brooding performance as Dario, Sean Teale manages to pull off the role of the film’s heartthrob. Kyle Allen plays a foolish Romeo, though his performance is relatively unmemorable, and Paris’s (Spencer Rayshon Stevenson) character is never developed beyond his sexuality. Isabela Merced as Juliet tries to subvert the stereotypical naivete of romantic heroines with a fierce, almost girlboss-ified energy, but her performance seems completely contrived and unbelievable.
The unaffecting performances result from their characters’ simplicity and lack of integrated complexity within the story. The problem of believability transcends performance. The characters’ colloquial speech attempts to cater to the film’s modern audience, rather than the story’s needs. Thus, the jokes fall flat and the characters seem to be speaking as only their ordained stereotype. These living tropes fail to integrate tonally with one another, creating a clear phoniness. Through the language and delivery, the filmmakers seem to beg Gen Z to watch “Rosaline,” though they underestimate how quickly catering to a certain style of humor starts to feel insincere if not entirely understood.
The film’s cinematography is woefully uninspired. In an attempt to make the setting appear soft and whimsical, the lighting sapps the onscreen characters of life force, most noticeably in scenes filmed outdoors. Especially in a film centered around two feuding aristocratic families, the lighting could have provided a tactful way to display the richness and depth of their wealth and the conflict itself through strong shadows and glittering highlights. Instead, the filmmakers rely on diffused light, creating softness in all of the wrong places.
The production design of Rosaline lacks any animating factor. Rosaline’s world seems devoid of any particular aesthetic interest, even as she begins to fall in love with Dario. The setting lacks distinctive features, leaving the frames vacant and peculiarly simple. The setting is stripped of unseemly parts, making the landscape appear barren and overly polished. The romantic comedy genre likely informed this decision to reduce the setting’s potentially darker subject matter and focus on the lighter and more superficial rendition of a classic drama.
The film caters towards the same historical romance niche as “Bridgerton,” especially with its relatively diverse cast and modern music, but without the same energy or boldness. Yet, these decisions seem haphazard, rather than intentional. The main characters are still mostly white or white-passing and the filmmakers mushed the music on top of an already messy film. The choice to modernize certain elements to draw in a larger viewership while keeping many aesthetic parts archaic was not handled skillfully, nor committed to carefully. In sum, “Rosaline” plays it safe — at its own expense.

To the delight of fans worldwide, Netflix released the third and final season of cult classic “Derry Girls” on Oct. 7. The show, created by Lisa McGhee, explores the tumultuous connection between two explosive conflicts: the final years of the Troubles, a decades-long period of violence and partisanship in Northern Ireland, and the drama of navigating high school. By Season Three, the “girls,” a squad that actually includes one boy, James (Dylan Llewellyn) have found their footing at Our Lady Immaculate College, and their various hijinks, foiled by an equally funny set of parents and relatives, are more ridiculous and entertaining than ever.
Fans of the show will recognize the signature blisteringly witty dialogue, punctuated by the musical Northern Irish accent and liberal use of slang and curse words. Each 25-minute episode contains its own neat plot: This season’s adventures include a trip to the beach, a Spice Girls dance performance, and a night in a “haunted” house. The jokes are relentless and fresh, as each sticky situation is resolved with heart and humor. Season Three also brings burgeoning romance, innovative pranks, a heist, and some more serious scenes exploring loss and grief.
The stories and motivations of the squad’s parents get fleshed out more, particularly Mary’s (Tara Lynn O’Neill) desire to go back to school and Grandpa Joe’s (Ian McElhinney) hopes for the future. One of the central triumphs of “Derry Girls” is its success as an intergenerational family comedy that gives each character, including the non-verbal baby Anna (Ava Grace McAaleese), a moment to shine. The cast is dynamic and convincing in both their dysfunction and their love, making the show all the more heartwarming and hilarious.
As with any family, they learn to love and accept each other, even as they grow and change. This season develops LGBTQ themes following Clare’s (Nicola Coughlan, “Bridgerton”) coming out to Erin (Saorise-Monica Jackson) as “a wee lesbian” in Season 1. At last, Clare gets her long-awaited romance, and with the cameo of gay Canadian cousin Rob (Alex Gaumond) in a poignant flashback episode featuring the parents in their high school years, we see the fumbling, loving acceptance that has contributed to this show’s popularity.
Overall a highly successful season, there are certainly moments that drag and jokes that don’t always land. Halfway through the new season, the quips begin to exhaust and the endless antics start to feel tropey and trite. But just when the show becomes a little too comfortable in its schemes, real-world anxieties leak through the bouncy ’90s facade, giving it an uncompromising realness and urgency.
The final episode, set one year after the events of the rest of the season, follows the characters as they prepare to vote in the Good Friday Referendum, an agreement that would change the course of Northern Irish history and put an end to the decades of violence and political unrest. In perhaps the most dramatic and emotionally complex moment of the show’s three seasons, Michelle (Jamie-Lee O’Donnell) and Erin argue over the terms of the referendum, which would release Michelle’s brother, who was implicated in a murder during a protest, from prison. The girls wrestle with reconciliation, and Michelle, usually brash and confident, tearfully concedes, “there’s no answer to any of this, is there?”
Indeed, the beauty of “Derry Girls” is that it never tries to find an answer. Instead, its three seasons have captivated viewers with stories of bold, anxious, hilarious, awkward, and earnest teens as they experience the messed-up, beautiful world around them. The show is unquestionably specific, from the costumes to the slang to the accents, yet universal and perfectly relatable. It is the best parts of a historical drama and a sitcom all rolled into one. In America in 2022, partisan violence and the struggles of compromise aren’t that hard to imagine. Having tackled themes that feel more relevant than ever, “Derry Girls” ends with optimism and hope: Even in difficult times, life goes on.

The art world has long been criticized for its lack of accessibility and elitism. This has been true from the 18th century, when the British Museum required people to show credentials proving they were of the echelons of high society in order to view its exhibits, to the modern day, in which museums offer memberships that afford special privileges to the wealthy while displaying art from artists they have not fairly compensated. In response, art lovers and artists alike have proposed radical methods to make art more accessible.
Most recently, the Rembrandt Heritage Foundation and HODL Finance have launched MetaRembrandt with the goal of making “Rembrandt's oeuvre accessible and insightful to everyone.” Whether or not they've succeeded in that goal is up for debate. Through MetaRembrandt, the Foundation has created an 8,000 piece NFT collection of Rembrandt’s famous painting “The Night Watch,” for sale on their website. For the price of 0.15 ethereum, which translates to $234.78 USD (as of October 29) plus a “gas fee” of 0.006 ethereum ($7.50 USD), anyone can acquire a virtual piece of the painting along with several exclusive benefits.
Owning a “Night Watch” NFT makes purchasers a founding member of the MetaRembrandt museum, affording them lifetime access to the collection. Additionally, the 8,000 founding members will be listed on the wall of fame in the MetaRebrandt museum, be able to generate passive income by renting out their NFT, have access to the full collection of Rembrandt’s oeuvre, access “exclusive events in the MetaRebrandt museum and real life,” and access the founders chat. The most striking of these privileges is the exclusive access to the MetaRembrandt museum afforded only to those who purchase the NFT.
The MetaRembrandt initiative is divided into 4 phases. Phase 1 involves the sale of the 8,000 NFT pieces. In phase two, The Rembrandt Heritage Foundation will publish a new art book and airdrop it to the 8,000 original founders of the MetaRembrandt Museum. In phase thr, the foundation will assemble a virtual museum in the Metaverse, showcasing Rembrandt’s work. In the fourth and final phase, all of Rembrandt’s artwork will be available, but only to the 8,000 people who purchased “Night Watch” NFTs.
For an initiative that supposedly champions accessibility, the word “exclusive” appears an alarming amount of times on the MetaRembrandt website. Though some believe that this initiative is crucial in bringing art into the developing digital realm, it is unclear just how the Rembrandt Heritage Foundation intends to expand accessibility with admission to their museum being set at such a high price point, excluding many from the benefits they describe.
The price of a single NFT ($234.78) is almost equal to the amount a federal minimum wage worker makes in a week ($290), making Rembrandt’s work inaccessible to the 1.1 million people who earn wages at or below the federal minimum. This price is also equal to a whopping 7.2 percent of the average U.S. resident’s monthly disposable income, making access to MetaRembrandt a luxury many cannot fit into their already tight budgets. Furthermore, the MetaVerse itself is inaccessible with the VR technology needed to view the virtual Rembrandt museum, which can cost upwards of $400.
MetaRembrandt does not succeed at its goal of making Rembrandt's work accessible to everyone. Evidently, it only expands access to Rembrandt’s artwork for wealthy members of society, who oftentimes are already able to pay for admission to museums showcasing Rembrandt’s paintings. Suspiciously, while accessibility to the artwork does not increase, the profits of the Rembrandt Heritage Foundation and HODL Finance do.
MetaRembrandt, then, brings the elitism of art curation to the virtual world by reinforcing the economic hierarchy that continues to plague the world of art. Not only is the museum only accessible to those with higher incomes, the privileges that come with purchasing an NFT — like a place on the museum’s wall of fame — create a sense of superiority among the exclusive “founders” group. While these wealthy few are able to rent their NFTs out at marked up prices to low-income people caught in the NFT craze, the founders are able to solidify their elite status by mingling with each other at the exclusive events their NFT ownership affords them invitations to. Such a system closely resembles the elitism that past museums (like the British Museum) and modern museums alike are criticized for.
MetaRembrandt is not making Rembrandt’s artwork accessible to all; they are virtually preserving Rembrandt’s art, as well as the exclusive and elite attitudes that surround it. Evidently, profit is the motivation behind the MetaRembrandt initiative, not expanding accessibility. More discussion on the merits of virtually preserving artwork is warranted, but that conversation cannot revolve around initiatives that prioritize profit and exclusivity over accessibility and artistic expression.

Taylor Swift released her 10th studio album on Friday, inviting reflection on her rise to popularity as a public figure. As the only female artist to win Album of the Year three times at the Grammy Awards, Swift’s stardom ascends past most of her peers’. However, as her fame grew, her relationship with the media changed significantly, progressing from writing songs with her crushes’ real names to allegedly transporting herself in suitcases for privacy.
Beginning her career in 2006 as a 16-year-old country star with curly blond hair and an accent she picked up after moving to Nashville, Swift was known for playing into “America’s sweetheart” tropes. She giggled in interviews and came up with the idea for her first single in math class.
However, Swift’s celebrity skyrocketed two years later, with the release of her sophomore album “Fearless.” The rise of smash hits “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me” coincided with her first Grammy wins, the beginning of a public obsession with her relationship status, and the infamous interaction with Kanye West at the 2009 VMAs.
It was a huge year for Swift, who became an idol for young girls, a radio staple, and the subject of serious public debate for the first time. Her public image evolved to a larger version of what she was known as in 2006, as she described begging her parents to take her to Nashville the way another child might ask to go to Disneyland and reintroduced herself to the world.
She easily revealed aspects of her personal life, sharing exactly which songs on “Fearless” were about Joe Jonas on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, explaining that the intro to a song on “Speak Now” was 27 seconds long because that was the length of the voicemail he’d broken up with her in. Relatable, endearing, and innocent, Swift was willing to “do anything” to hear the sound of screaming fans.
As a musician who’d began her career by performing the national anthem at sporting events, Swift was careful to be patriotic but never political, to never swear, and to fit the bill of a polite young girl. She was the symbol of hard work and traditional family values, thanking “God, and family for moving to Nashville” when she won at her first CMAs in 2007.
She reeled in the amount of herself she was willing to share with the world in the “Red” and “1989” eras but still emphasized her relatability and catapulted into even greater fame. She wrote about teaching boyfriends how to hide from the press in “I Know Places” and did her best to shift public focus from her romantic life by highlighting her friendships on tour and in music videos like “Bad Blood,” but she remained largely quiet about political issues and was instead applauded for her ability to rise above it all.
In 2016, everything changed when Kanye West released his song “Famous”, and controversy arose regarding a lyric mentioning Swift. A back and forth of swirling accusations, rebuttals, and commentary began, as other gossip about Swift’s breakup with Calvin Harris and feud with Katy Perry went public simultaneously. People spammed her social media with the snake emoji, and as a result Swift deleted all of her posts and began the “reputation” era, during which she reclaimed the snake, did almost no public appearances, and began a new era of her relationship with the media.
“There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation,” was the phrase Swift coined as she began the new era musically and publicly. It signaled a break from Swift’s unimposing demeanor and willingness to keep her mouth shut about politics. In October 2018, she posted on Instagram endorsing Phil Breseden, a Democratic candidate for United States senate in Tennessee, and encouraging her followers to vote.
Since then, Swift has released four new albums and two re-recorded albums. Her starpower has climbed even higher, as her newest album “Midnights” broke the record for the most-streamed album in a day in Spotify history.
Taylor Swift is an unmoving presence in popular culture, signaling that her decision to share her political opinions and move away from the people-pleasing she was so committed to has not hurt her celebrity. Although the media will never tire from discussing her romantic history, Swift has done her best to extend the stance she took with her “reputation” album, putting her art at the forefront of her public life and rarely sharing details about her now six year long relationship with actor Joe Alwyn. Now Swift leads with her music and uses her platform to amplify causes she cares about.

“Participation,” the second full-length novel by writer Anna Moschovakis, is a bold and innovative read that tells the story of a woman in two book clubs at a time of growing social, political, and climatic unrest. The woman, E, and the book clubs, Love and Anti-Love, combine with Moschovakis’s stylistic and structural choices to craft a novel that attempts to induct the reader into these communities, but instead only manages to offer a glimpse of E’s involvement.
There is no mission statement to be gleaned from the 216 pages of “Participation” — the novel is marred by opacity, with key questions about its characters, plot, and setting intentionally left unanswered. But the title, and the narrator’s explicit address of the reader throughout the novel, suggest that the reader, too, is a “participant” embedded in the fabric of the story and capable of forming independent relationships with the characters that resemble those formed amongst themselves.
This attempt at radical inclusion falls flat. Part of the problem is that Moschovakis’s storytelling is far too excellent. E, who narrates the novel’s first half, skillfully paints pictures of her city’s history, her professional life, her erotic fantasies, and her neglection of book club syllabi with ease, and sometimes all in a single page. Her stream-of-consciousness narration is inviting and thought-provoking, a seemingly endless string of apt observations.
Pausing these vivid, winding narrations in favor of E’s periodic, direct, and uncertain addresses of the reader — forcing them into the fold as a true participant — is initially easy to dismiss. But as the story unfolds and becomes even more gripping, this back-and-forth feels increasingly disruptive as the narrative continues to give way to a self-conscious rupture of the fourth wall, and the reader’s access to E’s mind becomes limited.
E becomes doubtful of her ability to tell the story, stating that the reader must have lots of questions, but then leaving those questions unanswered, usually never to be brought up again. She informs the reader that the events of her life and her book clubs are not proceeding “along linear lines,” but no explanation ever comes about why the book is this way.
These points of the story are E defeating herself. The lack of explanation, the bold and mystifying choice not to answer many of the reader’s reasonable questions, would have been better off left unacknowledged.
E’s awareness of her audience could have been an asset. But the lack of any justification or end goal for these monologues, coupled with an understanding that the reader is intended to be participating in something bigger than E’s story — a story about entire communities in which E is only our liaison — makes them disappointing at best.
When E passes the torch to an unnamed, similarly reader-aware and self-conscious narrator for the book’s second half, she says that she doesn't trust herself to tell the rest of the story properly, and that the reader should not be so quick to trust her, either. If one thing is clear, it is that E is certainly a subjective and unreliable narrator — but she was the narrator nonetheless, and it was her perspective within the book clubs that had been most compelling up until that point. The rest of the characters existed only as supporting acts in the mind-invented story of her life, which the audience is no longer privy to after the change in narration.
Especially since this change in narrator is not accompanied by any major shift in tone or style — Moschovakis writes with the same lovely, short sentences and vivid imagery — it seems as though the main purpose of this change was to include events that E was not present for. This makes sense when considering that a major goal of the novel is to challenge what it means to be a reader and to be a participant in a work of fiction. But with the lack of success on that front throughout much of the novel and the heavy focus on E, this change feels neither warranted nor welcome.
Overall, “Participation” is a wonderful book — the storytelling is truly excellent, and E and her successor have a refreshing approach to their roles as narrator. Unfortunately, this storytelling would have been better served in a more traditionally structured work of fiction; the constant interruptions to address and doubt the reader’s experience damage the novel’s broader goal of daring the reader to participate.

“They did this to you.” Other characters drill this assuration into the mind of Demon, the main character of Barbara Kingsolver’s newest novel, “Demon Copperhead.” The book, set in a poor county in southern Appalachia during the opioid epidemic, deals with the large question of who is to blame for a crisis. Kingsolver uses the perspective of a young boy to showcase the true parties at fault in rural America, including the institutional structures that ruin lives, corrupt children, and send communities into cycles of ruin. Inspired by the sweeping narrative of Charles Dickens’s “David Copperfield,'' Kingsolver uses compelling characters and an underrepresented setting to create a heart-wrenching portrait of the American opioid crisis.
Demon Copperhead — his first name a twist on “Damon,” his last name owed to the red hair he inherited from his father — has a lot of troubles. From the beginning, though, he takes responsibility for his entire life. The novel starts with the words, “First, I got myself born,” and from there Demon faces a variety of harrowing childhood experiences, including an opioid-addicted mother, an abusive stepfather, intense grief, child labor, and negligent guardianship. The responsibility that he takes for matters outside of his control makes readers immediately sympathetic for Demon. His resilience is repeatedly put on display, even as the mental scars of trauma start to weigh down upon him. Demon briefly rises from his troubles to become a star on his local football team — but this respite is interrupted by a devastating injury. This leads to Demon’s first use of opioids, and then the novel follows the arc of his life after this dreaded introduction.
This novel draws upon both current problems in Appalachia and the way that Dickens brought the lives of the trodden-down into public consciousness. Kingsolver, known for her acclaimed novel “The Poisonwood Bible,” was raised in rural Kentucky. There, she saw the effects of the opioid crisis in Appalachia first-hand. After visiting Charles Dickens’s home in England, Kingsolver was inspired by his “impassioned critique of institutional poverty” and decided to tackle modern American problems in a similar fashion. Her novel is just as eye-opening about the opioid epidemic as Dickens’s stories were for Victorian readers. Kingsolver’s deep admiration for Dickens shines throughout the novel; she refers to him as her “genius friend in the Acknowledgements. Even Demon compliments Dickens directly: “Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over and nobody giving a rat’s ass. You’d think he was from around here.”
Kingsolver reflects Dickens in other ways, too: Just as some people turn away from Dickens’s notoriously lengthy tales, the page count of “Demon Copperhead” — nearly 550 pages — has the potential to daunt readers. This is not without reason; books that reach this length often contain tangents that strike fast-paced readers as unnecessary. Sometimes the novel gets stuck in a “rinse and repeat” storyline, in which Demon escapes some form of torturous supervision just to get trapped in another. However, this torrent of misery is an effective way to emphasize the many obstacles that the people of Appalachia faced during the opioid crisis: a never-ending stream of misfortune that seemed inescapable.
The novel focuses on Demon, but it also features the strong women who shape his life. Although his mother’s addiction negatively impacts Demon, her love always stays with him. Other female influences in his life include Mrs. Peggot, his elderly neighbor who helps care for him when his mother is distracted, and June, another Peggot relative that becomes a guiding light in Demon’s life after he tunnels into addiction. Kingsolver crafts the Peggot women as the embodiment of resilience and kindness amidst the crisis. There are more amazing female characters, but the one that shines is Angus, Demon’s foster sister. Angus defies expectations of both Applachian and female stereotypes, and is one of the only characters that truly recognizes how much Demon has gone through. Kingsolver’s strong female characters show the especially intense struggles that women underwent during the opioid crisis — forced to face the dangers of addiction while often being put into roles in which they had to care for others.
The novel also stands against stereotypes of rural Americans — Demon often remarks that city people don’t understand Appalachian life. He begins to see how his county has been systematically ignored throughout the crisis and the way that opioids were peddled recklessly to vulnerable community members. Demon is able to survive the institutions that worked against him — but he also acknowledges that so many lives were not adequately protected. Kingsolver reveals the humanity behind the numbers of the crisis and the stereotypes that prevented help from coming to the places that needed it the most.
Overall, the novel has the potential to open the eyes of many Americans that have been sheltered from the opioid crisis, whether they were oblivious to its toll on rural areas or are too young to remember its significance and the scars that it has inflicted on some of our country’s most defenseless groups. The dreary subject matter will not be for everyone, and those afraid of lengthy novels may be intimidated, but “Demon Copperhead” is an odyssey not to miss. It highlights the resilience and strength that can grow from some of the world’s darkest places, and reminds us not to ignore and belittle those who have grown up in a world that works against them.

On Oct. 21, Taylor Swift released her highly anticipated 10th album “Midnights.” She soon revealed the news that “Midnights” would be a visual album, accompanied by a series of interconnected music videos written and directed by Swift. The first video, created for lead single “Anti-Hero,” is a delightfully kitschy, self-referential video full of Swift’s trademark Easter eggs. It also offers an honest glimpse into her insecurities.
The video opens with Swift being interrupted mid-meal by a group of bedsheet ghosts that chase her around the house. As the chorus begins, Swift opens the front door to find a doppelganger of herself. This “anti-hero” Swift wears sparkly outfits and has seemingly endless energy — she downs shots and smashes a guitar while the real Swift vomits in horror.
Accompanied by the hook “I’m the problem, it’s me,” Swift’s music video alter ego manifests as a visual representation of her intrusive thoughts and unwelcome self-criticism. In one scene, the anti-hero version of Swift points at a blackboard with the words “everyone will betray you” written on it, while her real self takes notes.
Swift further illustrates her self-consciousness in the second verse, where a giant-sized version of Swift tries in vain to participate in a dinner party. After accidentally ruining the too-small table, the guests scream and scatter, and one shoots her with an arrow.
“I struggle a lot with the idea that my life has become unmanageably sized, and not to sound too dark, I struggle with the idea of not feeling like a person,” Swift said on Instagram about the song. The “unmanageable size” of Swift’s life is brought to life in the music video through her giant self, as well as in the song’s lyrics: “Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby / And I'm a monster on the hill / Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city.”
And yes, there are plenty of Easter eggs hidden throughout “Anti-Hero.” The video makes several references to Swift’s past work, such as the rotary phone from the music video for “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” heart-shaped glasses and cat ears used in the “22” music video, and the blue guitar she played during the “Speak Now” tour.
However, the music video also seems to poke gentle fun at how fans constantly hunt for Easter eggs in her work and personal life. The song fades out as the video transitions to a scene of Swift’s vision of her funeral. Her two sons and daughter-in-law (played by Mike Birbiglia, John Early, and Mary Elizabeth Ellis) are appalled to learn that Swift has left them only 13 cents each and left the rest of her money to her cats.
In the scene, Swift’s son Chad insists that his mother must have left a secret message in her will that would reveal her children’s actual inheritance. Excited, the children look closely at the will to find an extra note: “P.S. There’s no secret encoded message that means something else. Love, Taylor.” An angry Chad accuses daughter-in-law Kimber of murdering Swift for her money, which escalates into a fistfight as Swift watches with shock from inside her casket.
Do Swift’s fictional children represent her fans, combing through tweets and counting fence holes to find secret messages? Possibly, but it’s more likely that they represent Swift’s fear of those who want to exploit her fame — for instance, people who get close to her only for her money. As her alter-ego points out, she’s afraid that everyone will betray her.
It should be noted that the music video has drawn some backlash due to a scene in which Swift steps onto a scale and watches the word “fat” appear on the screen, while her alter-ego shakes her head in disappointment. Some have criticized this scene as being fatphobic, while others maintain that it’s merely an accurate reflection of Swift’s disordered eating, which she has spoken about in the past. Regardless, the clip has now been edited out of the music video.
Swift wrote on Instagram that the music video was a way to “watch [her] nightmare scenarios and intrusive thoughts play out in real time.” These intrusive thoughts demand her attention through their flashiness and overwhelming presence, which is reimagined in the music video. The song and video are both entertaining and deeply personal, showing a vulnerability to Swift that’s relatable to fans, critics, and anyone who has ever been their own problem.

Netflix’s new docudrama “The Playlist” opens with a scene of Daniel Ek (Edvin Endre), founder of Spotify, running up onto a stage as a crowd cheers for him in the background. But this is not always how Ek was perceived by the public.
“The Playlist” not only focuses on the creation of Spotify but also dives into the nuances of Daniel Ek’s childhood that led him to reinvent the music industry to be accessible for everyone.
As viewers get a front row seat to Ek’s childhood, we learn that he could barely afford to buy music growing up and he never wanted anyone else to feel that embarrassment and pain. At the time, there was a music pirating website but it wasn’t very fast, and there was no way to organize the music you enjoyed listening to. Ek decided he would create the most efficient and user-friendly music streaming platform he could think of.
At the start of the series, Ek is painted as a Robin Hood-like character in the music industry. However, this image is quickly ruined due to one crucial flaw in Ek’s plan: Although Spotify allows consumers to access music for free, it pays artists close to nothing. Thus despite his initially altruistic vision, the founder of Spotify quickly turned into a money-hungry titan.
However, this switch is portrayed quite abruptly within the context of the show, leaving viewers questioning not only Ek’s intentions, but also the show’s writing. Did Ek really care about music accessibility? Or was this angle just a ploy to boost his public image? It is unclear whether the lack of clarity surrounding these questions is an intentional choice by the writers or simply a hole in the storyline.
Nevertheless, the docuseries succeeds in illustrating the complexities of this situation, showing both Ek’s success and others’ sorrows due to Spotify’s growth. This two-sided narrative viewpoint makes it difficult for audiences to pick a side: Who should be prioritized, the consumers or the creators? Is there a way to balance these interests without going bankrupt?
Something unique about this series was the raw emotion seen throughout the story displayed by Edvin Endre’s performance as Ek: His stress levels can be felt through the screen. Viewers will surely feel Ek’s anxiety in the show’s tense moments, such as when his musician friend calls him out for stealing her money and ruining the music industry.
Furthermore, the series is captivating because its subject matter — Spotify — is familiar and personal to the audience. Ek worked his team insanely hard to build the app that was so fast that it was theoretically supposed to break the Internet; however, it was for the benefit of the user experience.
Despite its strengths, “The Playlist” feels a bit too dense at times. In addition to the main plotline, there is a continuous lawsuit going on due to Spotify's business model of distributing artists’ music to consumers for free and aspects of this chaos become quite confusing at times in combination with the moral dilemma presented to the audience.
Indeed, there are almost too many things going on in Daniel Ek’s life for viewers to follow. Creating some sort of flowchart or taking notes is majorly helpful if you truly want to analyze this intriguing storyline.
Regardless of the information overload compiled in this series, “The Playlist” is nevertheless an exciting watch that provides fascinating insight into the hidden secrets of Spotify’s creation. Viewers will be reminded of this wild story every time they open the Spotify app, and it’s definitely an amazing conversation starter.

Halloween is not often celebrated for its music. Besides time-honored classics such as “Monster Mash,” “Thriller,” “Spooky Scary Skeletons,” and “Calling All the Monsters” (China Anne McClain made a true classic — timeless beyond the boundaries of Disney), what else is there? If you’re still crafting a festive playlist for a Halloween party or want to feel edgy as you study for your never-ending midterms, here are a few more suggestions to fill out your Halloween playlist for good.
“How Not To Drown” by CHVRCHES
CHVRCHES is typically known for bright electronic pop, but their newest album “Screen Violence” introduced a new edge to their sound. On “How Not To Drown,” a heavy beat and eerie synths immediately overwhelm the production, contrasting with Lauren Mayberry’s iconic, youthful voice. The chorus is dangerously addictive: The bass blares as Mayberry bellows, “Tell me how / It’s better when the sun goes down / We will never escape this town / I wasn’t scared when he caught me, look what it taught me.” It’s catchy and creepy and embodies Halloween.
“Little Dark Age” by MGMT
Yes, I know this was played far too often after TikTok got wind of it in 2020, but you will not regret giving this track a relisten. Its dark ‘80s synths paired with VanWyngarden’s echoed vocals create our modern “Monster Mash” — I cannot think of another recent song that sounds so distinctly like Halloween. This song, and honestly all of its accompanying album (try “When You Die”), will be the perfect staple in your streaming this season, and for years to come.
“Magic Act” by Spellling
Quite simply my favorite album release from 2021, Spellling’s “The Turning Wheel” is a masterpiece. Her “Magic Act'' is a slowburner, with synths that could’ve come from Bowser’s Castle and deep, drawn-out vocals. Her attention to detail will easily prevent it from aging (and I’ve replayed it enough times to attest this). The track’s peak is its breathtaking guitar solo that starts midway and closes out the song — it has the drama necessary to accompany any Halloween night.
“Frankenstein” by Rina Sawayama
Rina Sawayama has triumphantly dominated the pop genre this year with her September release “Hold The Girl.” Thankfully, she did not fully leave behind her past metal influences. “Frankenstein” is a punchy pop hit embellished with eerie sound effects that crashes into a robust chorus that will make you headbang like you did to her “STFU!.” The lyrics scream Halloween. The energy screams Halloween. We’re all screaming Halloween. Go listen.
“Limousine” by Brand New
This might not be a song for your party, but it is certainly one for Halloween. The track is simply unsettling. It oscillates between cold, quiet guitars and fiery riffs with desperate vocals. Its guitar solo screeches in after the perfect build of the bridge; a sonic climax that will never lose its allure. If you can lean into its dramatics, you’ll be reaching for this every October. (Check out their song “Waste” if you can’t get past scream-singing and would prefer melodramatic, steady rock instead.)
“Strategist” by Kensuke Ushio
Have I seen the Netflix-released anime “Devilman Crybaby?” Not yet, but I’ve already listened to the soundtrack too many times to count. “Strategist” is a quick instrumental track that sounds like the background of a groovy horror movie. The heavy staccato synths pulse the song along as ghostly strings glide across it, the production ultimately building to a pound to a heavy beat. It’s perfectly short and sweet, and will keep you hitting replay this Halloween.
“Dance In The Dark” by Lady Gaga
“Silicone. Saline. Poison. Inject me, baby, I’m a free b*tch. I’m a free b*tch.” Lady Gaga enters with these unforgettable words over a Victorian-era sounding key guitar. Maybe you forgot about this less popular track on her masterful “Fame Monster.” Well, now is the time to relisten. With a powerful bass and Gaga's evocative vocals (including some of the only vocal-chopping I will praise), this dark techno pop song deserves a Halloween rebrand.
“Spirit” by Ghost
Even if you haven’t heard of Ghost, you’ve probably already heard their revived TikTok hit, “Mary On A Cross.” They clearly do seventies surf-rock justice, but that is far from their usual sound. The genre-bending metal band is perfect for Halloween with their theatrical guitars and spooky clerical aesthetic. “Spirit” opens with what seems to be taken directly from a “Scooby Doo” soundtrack before divulging into choppy guitars and Forge’s strong yet haunting voice (tastefully backed by a church choir in its chorus). It is genuinely great metal, rock, and pop while simultaneously on the cusp of cheesy horror. It’s perfect.
“This Is How I Disappear” by My Chemical Romance
Do I even need to explain this one? To only choose one MCR song for a Halloween playlist is almost blasphemous, but I had to limit myself to just one favorite from “The Black Parade” (but you should listen to more). It’s MCR at their best — fast paced power chords and Gerard’s triumphantly emo vocals. I simply do not have the words to describe the impact of this bridge: Gerard’s falsetto that devolves into screaming, the perfectly placed guitar lick at 3:07, the layered outro vocals. Just listen, please.

This review contains spoilers for Season Two of “One of Us Is Lying.”
Simon says you should never try and cover up a murder. The main characters in “One of Us is Lying” — also known collectively as “murder club” — learn this lesson all too well in Season Two of the Peacock show.
Starting right where Season One’s cliffhanger left off, murder club deals with the aftermath of murdering Jake, the antagonist from the previous season. Audiences see them attempt to cover up the murder through a series of quick decisions: dump the body, return the gun, and get rid of the car. They even make up the rumor that Jake (Barrett Carnahan) fled to Mexico after he got caught for Simon’s (Mark McKenna) murder. But unbeknownst to the group, someone was watching as they hatched their plan — and they planned to make murder club pay for it.
Meet Simon Says, the main anonymous antagonist of Season Two, who has video proof of the club’s involvement in Jake’s murder. Throughout the entire season we see Simon Says blackmailing the crew, making them commit several heinous (and often illegal) acts. From making Cooper (Chibuikem Uche) wear Jake’s engraved watch to forcing Janae (Jess McLeod) to vandalize Simon’s grave, Simon Says makes the crew look more and more suspicious as the season goes along. This unfortunately doesn’t go unnoticed as Vanessa (Sara Thompson), a wannabe social media influencer, immediately points fingers at the crew. Not believing that Jake killed Simon or that he would flee, she starts a #justiceforjake campaign, determined to find out what happened to him and how the crew was involved. Vanessa isn’t the only one desperate to find Jake, as his older brother Cole (Joe Witkowski) comes back into town, questioning what the crew knows about Jake’s disappearance.
Although the show gears up to deliver a classic whodunnit mystery formula, it struggles to find its footing at the start of the season, adding in several useless plots that don’t add anything to the story. Perhaps the biggest error is the love triangle between Bronwyn (Marianly Tejada), Nate (Cooper van Grootel), and newly-introduced character Fiona (Doralynn Mui). Even when Nate and Fiona’s brief romance is revealed to Nate’s girlfriend Bronwyn, she’s barely fazed and immediately forgives him for it. This entire arc adds little to the season; rather, it detracts from the show’s character building, cheapening the relationship between Nate and Bronwyn.
Fortunately, the slow pacing of the season allows for some heartwarming character moments, as we get to see Janae grapple with their gender identity, for example. In an honest conversation with Addy (Annalisa Cochrane), Janae opens up about how sometimes she feels like a girl and other times a boy. This conversation is not only handled very well, but also very relatable. Janae’s conversation with Maeve (Melissa Collazo) later in the season is truly one of the season’s best, as they come to terms with possibly being gender fluid. A true standout moment is when Maeve says Janae is very handsome, and they break out into a smile.
Unfortunately, the wonderful character moments come to an abrupt pause as episode six takes the season’s pacing from inconsistent to bizarre. Renaming the title screen, “All of Them Are Lying,” the entire episode is randomly from Vanessa’s perspective. Not only is the shift in perspective abrupt, but it also proves to be very boring as the entire episode follows Vanessa catching up on information the audience has known from the beginning of the season. This obvious attempt at a character revamp ultimately doesn't work: The whole episode feels like a bathroom break, and its unnecessary change in structure causes the show to lose any grip it previously had on its audience.
Fortunately, the last two episodes pick up pace quickly as the mystery of Simon Says comes to a head. The crew, with the unlikely help of Vanessa, figure out the mysterious figure’s true identity. This revelation pays off. The reveal and aftermath of Simon Says lets the show bask in what it does best, pulling back the curtain and letting us see all the moving parts. However, the finale also leaves the audience with many lingering questions, as another character mysteriously dies in prison in a way that clearly mirrors Simon’s death in season one. The season ends with yet another cliffhanger, though it's unsure how it connects to the rest of the story. Ultimately, though the season may have fumbled more times than it scored, it still succeeds in leaving the audience wanting more, wondering what mayhem the murder club will get themselves into next.

After three years, Hozier is back, and he is unafraid to speak his mind. Irish singer Andrew Byrne Hozier released “Swan Upon Leda,” the first single off of his upcoming third album “Unreal Unearth.” At once ethereal and arresting, “Swan Upon Leda” is a sophisticated investigation of the dynamics of oppression that both deifies and humanizes those who dare to resist injustice across the world.
Four days before the song was released, Hozier introduced “Swan Upon Leda” on social media with a powerful statement of support for Iranian protesters advocating for civil liberties in the wake of Mahsa Amini’s killing. Hozier further wrote that he decided to release the song as a “show of solidarity” for American women in a post-Roe v. Wade world, and committed to donating to four charities that advocate for reproductive healthcare and women’s rights. In his message, Hozier quoted Egyptian author Mona Eltahawy’s judgement that systemic oppression of women is the world’s “oldest form of occupation,” saying that “ever since hearing [Eltahawy] speak in Dublin, I wanted to explore that thought in a piece.”
From its opening thrum of Irish folk-inspired acoustic guitar, “Swan Upon Leda” delves into Eltahawy’s message. The title of the song is a reference to the ancient Greek myth of Leda and the Swan, in which Zeus, attracted by Leda’s beauty, transforms into a swan and forcefully impregnates her. Hozier connects the theme of Zeus’s violation, and the children Leda was forced to bear, with the experience of women denied their reproductive rights. He laments this fate for a young girl forced to give birth: singing that “a crying child pushes a child into the night,” after being told her husband would “come this time / without leaving so much as a feather behind.” The narrative parallelism of Leda and the unnamed protagonist unites their struggle and suffering, positioning the modern day patriarchy in a historical context of injustice that transcends time and mortality.
The chorus, however, challenges both Zeus’s dominion over Leda and the husband’s control over the young mother. The subtle whisper of Hozier’s voice in the first verse gives way to a chorus sung in octaves. While the lower octave remains gentle, the higher octave quietly screams, and as Hozier pushes the boundaries of his vocal range it feels as though he contends with heaven itself. “The gateway to the world,” Hozier sings, “was still outside the reach of him / What never belonged to angels / Had never belonged to men.” Hozier asserts that despite the best efforts of men and gods, women are still the only ones who control their bodies, and, by extension, human life. In a sophisticated double entendre, Hozier’s assertion that reproduction “never belonged to angels” challenges the sometimes regressive role of religion as it relates to women’s and civil rights, a topic he explored on his breakout 2013 hit “Take Me To Church.”
In the last line of the chorus, Hozier broadens the scope of resistance covered in the song, connecting the interpersonal violence of the “swan upon Leda” to the international violence of Israel’s “empire upon Jerusalem.” Previously, the singer has compared colonialism in Ireland and Palestine; in May, 2021, he signed a pro-Palestine open letter that highlighted the similarities between historical English policies in Ireland and Israel’s actions in Palestine. This reference is expanded in the second verse, which recounts the story of a grandmother smuggling medicine through checkpoints in occupied Palestinian territory. Hozier compares the boys who guard the checkpoint to the Irish mythological hero Sétanta, a child warrior who volunteers to guard the house of a blacksmith in place of a dog he kills. By connecting these checkpoint soldiers with Sétanta, who the singer argues “stood dead” at his watch, Hozier elevates even the young guards into the mythical metaphor, protesting the surrender of their lives to the system of oppression they enforce.
What makes “Swan Upon Leda” so compelling is its insistence that despite the mythical stakes of subjugation and resistance, violence is not actually predetermined, and the people who comprise unjust systems are indeed only people. Hozier extends compassion to those trapped in systems of hate, lamenting the cyclical violence that causes “one more sweet boy to be butchered by man.” Furthermore, rather than being wholly evil, his imagined checkpoint soldier is just “someone’s frightened boy” with his “gun in a trembling hand.” By humanizing both oppressor and oppressed, Hozier offers some hope for change; despite the celestial magnitude of systemic injustice, it is merely fallible humans who harm others, and no human is beyond redemption.

“This is by far the biggest show we’ve ever played in Boston,” Brandi Carlile said as she greeted the roaring crowd of TD Garden. “It’s utterly surreal.”
The experience was surreal for the audience, too. Carlile, a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter from Washington state, made it easy to forget that anything existed outside of the arena. She is one of the most phenomenal artists on tour this year, guaranteed to deliver captivating performances, entertaining stories, talented guests, and vocals that sound even better live than on record.
Brittany Howard, lead vocalist and guitarist of Alabama Shakes, opened the concert with songs from her debut solo album “Jaime.” She alternated between sweet, mellow tunes that had the audience swaying with their loved ones and bold, high-energy performances amplified by shredding guitar, dancing, and passionate lyrics about unity and strength. Howard was the perfect opening act — an invigorating presence whose mind-blowing voice made attending the concert worthwhile long before Carlile took the stage.
After a brief intermission, identical twins Phil and Tim Hanseroth — whom Carlile has been performing with for almost two decades — restored the energy with an electric guitar medley of crowd-pleasers like “The Final Countdown.” When they transitioned into the “Broken Horses” intro, Carlile triumphantly walked onstage in her sparkly suit and jumped into the song that set a bright tone for the rest of the concert. Leading the setlist with 2021’s “Broken Horses” was a brilliant decision; the powerful song showcased Carlile’s astounding vocal range and trademark rock with a touch of country twang.
What followed was a dynamic, multi-genre blend of exhilaration and tenderness. Carlile navigated between pared back, folky tunes like “The Mother” and complex rock songs that required the entirety of her band. With or without backup, her stage presence was undeniable; she was just as enchanting alone with a piano as she was interacting with her fellow musicians. In her standout performance of “Right on Time,” the first track on her 2021 album “In These Silent Days,” Carlile put her vocal control on full display, belting with an even vibrato that evoked cheers from the crowd at the end of every long note. This control allowed her to create ethereal harmonies with her band and guest performers, particularly with the Hanseroth twins. It comes as no surprise that after almost 20 years of performing together, the three voices can merge effortlessly to become one cohesive sound.
Carlile performed others’ music just as well as her own. She paid homage to David Bowie and Radiohead with performances of “Space Oddity” and “Creep” that would have made the creators proud. She captured the intensity of the original songs, but her down-to-earth personality and smooth vocals brought a unique warmth to her renditions.
Although she shone onstage, Carlile was not always the center of attention. She frequently paused to praise her backup singers and musicians — and for good reason. Her band covered the typical drum kit, guitar, bass, and keyboard, with the unique addition of violin, viola, cello, and less conventional percussion instruments such as a shekere. The instrumental variety added a beautiful depth to songs, and Carlile made sure to spotlight their artistry. In “Sinners, Saints and Fools,” for instance, the string quartet is crucial in the song’s climax, an organized chaos driven by the quick and forceful playing of their instruments.
Carlile also featured guest performers throughout the show, including Celisse, Allison Russell, and Brittany Howard. The duet with Howard, a cover of James Brown’s “It’s a Man’s World,” was one of the most unforgettable moments of the night, a collaboration between two powerhouses.
Carlile is more than just a singer: She is a storyteller, through lyrics and the spoken word. Between songs, Carlile became more of a friend than a celebrity. She let the audience in on a few stories, including a hilarious recount of the late legend John Prine telling her, “Don’t worry about dropping the baby; it won’t be the last time.” Her words also grappled with more serious subject matter, including marriage equality, gun violence, and reproductive rights. With an anecdote about getting married to her wife in Massachusetts came a reminder about the importance of accepting people as they are. Carlile made every audience member feel welcome, advocating for love, compassion, and progress toward a better future.
The concert ended with a solo performance of “Over the Rainbow.” Carlile kept it simple: She stood with an acoustic guitar, strumming and singing softly as the screen behind her boasted the rainbow colors of pride. Despite its simplicity, the act was rich with meaning; it called to mind the themes of love and hope that arose over the course of the concert and reminded the audience of Carlile’s excellence. With nothing more than a guitar in hand, Carlile left thousands in awe of her character and her voice.
Leaving the glow of TD Garden on Oct. 21, it became clear that Carlile’s concert was the perfect escape. Every performance radiated energy and inclusivity. A testament to her talent was the lack of phone screens held up in the audience. Viewers snapped the occasional photo or video, but Carlile’s presence was such a gift that to watch through a screen would have been a waste.

After six long years, Rihanna’s newest single “Lift Me Up” is the singer’s first solo song released since her last album “Anti” in 2016. The song was released as part of the soundtrack for the upcoming film “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'' and was made in remembrance of the late Chadwick Boseman. “Lift Me Up” was co-written by Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems, Oscar-winning composer Ludwig Göransson, and “Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler.
Fundamentally, “Lift Me Up” is not attempting to be another high-energy Rihanna single. Instead, the song utilizes a slower tempo to set up an emotional tone of remembrance for the upcoming “Black Panther” movie. Rihanna’s ballad is beautifully sung, and its pace allows listeners to listen closely and reflect upon each lyric. Having this single predate the release of the film similarly allows for listeners to imagine emotional scenes of the upcoming film alongside the calming hymn.
Rihanna’s single also seems to reflect her since her recent entry into motherhood. “Lift Me Up” is the singer’s first musical release since having a child with rapper ASAP Rocky. “Lift Me Up” plays like a lullaby, with Rihanna’s vocals and humming lulling the song into a steady and calming rhythm. This new style could be emblematic of her experience as a mother to her son, who she gave birth to in May. Moreover, the soft string instruments add to this effect and highlight harp plucking emblematic of African harps, such as the kora.
The slow nature of the ballad is almost entrancing — ensuring that the song elicits more than one listen. In addition, the lyrics of the single pack a punch, as each line is hauntingly powerful and compelling. While upon first listen, the ballad seems short and sweet, each lyric of the song plays an important role in the goal of the single: to remember those that were lost.
"After speaking with Ryan and hearing his direction for the film and the song, I wanted to write something that portrays a warm embrace from all the people that I’ve lost in my life,” Tems said in an interview with Variety.
While some fans may be surprised at Rihanna’s return to music being a slow hymn, “Lift Me Up” plays an important role in establishing the tone of the upcoming “Black Panther” film and remembering the legacy of Chadwick Boseman. This single is also just the beginning of Rihanna’s return, as she is slated to headline for the Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show in February of 2023. With the release of her new single that differs from her traditional image of a pop icon, only time will tell where the trajectory of Rihanna’s music is headed.

“If there’s no resistance, then chances are you aren’t fighting the right fight,” Dee-1 tells The Harvard Crimson.
David Augustine, better known by his stage name Dee-1, is the 2022-2023 Nasir Jones Hip-hop Fellow at Harvard’s Hiphop Archive & Research Institute housed within the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. The award, first given in 2013, is named after the rapper Nas, who just happens to be Dee-1’s favorite rapper.
Top 10 Billboard charting, Emmy nominated, and NAACP award-winning rapper, Dee-1 is also the first artist to be appointed by the governor of Louisiana to the Executive Council, where he serves on the Louisiana Executive Council for the success of Black men and boys. All of these accolades and accomplishments, just to name a few, embody what it means to be the Nasir Jones Hip-hop Fellow.
The fellowship, according to the Hutchins Center’s website, “fund[s] scholars and artists who demonstrate exceptional scholarship and creativity in the arts in connection with hip-hop.” Fellows’ projects may include manuscript projects, performance pieces, album work, among many other possibilities. “I'm doing my research on the role that hip hop plays as a teaching tool inside the black community,” Dee-1 said of his own project in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Dee-1 has been on both sides of his research as both an educator and a hip-hop artist. Born and raised in New Orleans, he attended Louisiana State University and began rapping while in college. When he graduated, he became a middle school teacher in Baton Rouge for a couple of years until he resigned to focus exclusively on his rap career. Throughout his life, he has seen firsthand how gun violence affected his community. He has had best friends get murdered because, he said, they were trying to live the lifestyle that was being rapped about in the popular hip-hop songs.
Dee-1 told The Crimson that this influence that hip-hop has isn’t like that of other music genres. He said that hip-hop is not only a genre of music but a culturally defining way of life. “You've never had a genre of music before that has been used to define a whole generation,” the rapper said. “So they don't say, ‘Oh, this is the R&B generation.’ Yes, the Gospel generation, this the country generation, but they call this the hip-hop generation. [...] It's more than just music [ ...] and we can't divorce ourselves from the lyrics and the lifestyle that's associated with the lyrics.”
According to the artist, the history of Black music has always been the history of using music as an expressive force to articulate the structural conditions and oppression that Black people have to live with. Music is also a vehicle to cope with the anti-Blackness that one faces.
“Hip-hop was birthed out of rebellion. It was birthed out of a sense of social activism and just wanting to have a soundtrack to a movement, Dee-1 said. “This is civil rights. You know, Martin Luther King just got killed years prior. Malcolm X just got killed. You definitely got people that are making music at that time for the sake of starting a movement, a positive movement.”
Hip-hop’s shift from the music of rebellion to an easily-commodified genre may be due to its growth in popularity. At one point, Dee-1 believes it became more about the money than the message. “People’s priorities changed,” Dee-1 said, and because of that, the listener’s mindsets shifted too. “We can make some real good money in this genre,” Dee-1 added.
Still, there is arguably a spectacle of enjoyment in seeing and hearing about the violence perpetually done to Black bodies, a fact that Dee-1 said is at the root of the problems with the current music industry. He says that artists and the music industry alike have a role in what music gets pushed out to the masses, but now fans have developed a taste and enjoyment for a certain type of music and that isn’t healthy for society.
To fight against the enjoyment that people get from listening to music that aggrandizes anti-Black terror is Dee-1’s goal. He also told The Crimson that it’s a method for coping with the perpetual death and tragedy that surrounds him. Instead of sitting on the sidelines, he says he prioritizes “making a dent in the rap game and being able to do shows all around the country and travel and tour and now do speaking engagements. That's how I cope with it.”
Dee-1 most recently hosted a talk at Hutchin’s Center about the direction rap is going and whether it is leading society to the killing fields or the dance floor. He also currently has an album out titled “Finding Balance,” and has another one in the works. If Dee-1 would leave a person with a word of advice, he would tell them, following one of his songs titled “3s Up,” “Be real, be righteous and be relevant.”

College sophomore Jennifer R. Yu ’25 took home the 2022 U.S. Women’s Chess Championship title late last month after a 17-day tournament in St. Louis.
After winning eight out of the first 13 rounds in the tournament, Yu won two out of three playoff rounds against Irina B. Krush, a Grandmaster and eight-time U.S. Women's Chess Champion. Yu claimed the $40,000 prize after her victory in the final round.
Yu competed in her first U.S. championship at age 13. She played in the tournament each year until she won her first championship in 2019. Her victory this year makes her one of 16 women to win the title more than once in the tournament’s 85-year history.
After tying in the first two playoff matches against Krusih, Yu’s victory came in a “winner-take-all game” that is rare in chess tournaments, according to Wesley Wang ’26, a Harvard Chess Club member. The Armageddon game is a single time-controlled game guaranteed to produce a winner.
Christopher Y. Shen ’26, another Harvard Chess Club member, described this final high-stakes game as “stomach turning.”
During the game, Yu made what she called a “really rudimentary mistake.” She moved a bishop where it could be taken by Krush, a blunder that put her win at risk.
“In the moment, everyone thought it was over,” Shen, who was watching the game, said.
Despite Yu's blunder, a few mistakes from Krush — along with what Harvard Chess Club president James C. Toliver ’23 described as a “deliberate, well-planned” recovery — led to Yu’s final victory.
“She managed to win," Toliver said. "It was crazy,"
"I’m surprised we didn’t get a noise complaint,” he added about the club’s watch party for the match.
This tournament marked Yu's first U.S. Women’s Chess Championship since she entered college. Though she said it was “nice” to take a break from chess, she said she feels as though chess “was a major part” of her identity growing up and that she wanted to return.
Yu said she does not memorize opening move sequences as much as she should, especially after her break.
“Anyone that looks at my game, they know that I’m pretty weak there. So when I’m playing tournaments like these, I’m oftentimes just worse off the bat,” she said.
Yu said her playing style relies on trying to make up for her weakness by complicating the game for her opponent.
“I don’t really give up,” she said.
Though she has balanced schoolwork and chess since she began playing in elementary school, Yu said it’s “much more difficult now.”
Currently a Woman Grandmaster, her next goal is to become an International Master, the second most difficult chess title to attain. Guaranteed a spot by her recent victory, Yu is also set to compete in the 2023 Chess World Cup.
She also plans to return to the 2023 U.S. Women’s Chess Championship.
“Hopefully, I’m going to defend my title next year,” Yu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students staged a campus rally in support of affirmative action Monday as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases brought by Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard and the University of North Carolina.
Roughly 20 students, many holding posters and chanting “Diversity is under attack!” crowded around the John Harvard Statue for the demonstration. Meanwhile, hundreds of students from Harvard and other colleges rallied outside the Supreme Court in Washington.
The lawsuits allege the schools’ race-conscious admissions processes are discriminatory, with SFFA arguing the Court should overturn its precedent and eliminate affirmative action in higher education. Harvard has denied the allegations and decried SFFA’s legal battle against race-conscious admissions.
Many of the demonstrators’ chants criticized SFFA President Edward J. Blum, who has led eight lawsuits that have ascended to the Supreme Court. Blum’s suits have attempted to strike down race-conscious policies around voting rights and college admissions.
“Hey hey, ho ho, Edward Blum has got to go,” the protesters yelled. “Send him home ’cause we say no.”
Kiersten B. Hash ’25, the political action chair for the Generational African American Students Association, said in an interview that Monday’s rally was a way for students who could not travel to Washington to make their voices heard.
“For those of us who couldn’t make it to D.C., still wanting to use our voice and create this echo rally is so important,” said Hash, who delivered a speech and led chants at Monday’s demonstration.
“It’s important that we have this catharsis and are able to come out and scream and yell and advocate for diversity,” she added.
In a speech, Asian American Women’s Association President Kaitlyn Tsai ’25 called on protesters to affirm that students of color have a place at Harvard.
“I think it’s really important for all of us to remember that we are as entitled to be here as anyone else,” said Tsai, a Crimson magazine editor. “We belong here.”
Sikhs and Companions of Harvard President Tarina K. Ahuja ’24 said in a speech that the belief that Asian Americans do not support affirmative action is a “heartbreaking” misconception.
“We need solidarity between every single one of our communities, and without that solidarity, we’re not going to progress. Affirmative action supports all of us,” Ahuja said. “All of us are standing here together, and nobody can tell us that our communities are divided because they are not.”
“We will stay here together, and we will continue fighting together,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON — Though the Supreme Court convened on Monday to examine race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, the question of legacy applicant preferences took the spotlight for much of the day’s oral arguments.
During five hours of back-to-back hearings, the court’s conservative justices questioned whether eliminating legacy admissions could provide a race-neutral strategy to achieve racial diversity on college campuses.
Though the court has long upheld the constitutionality of race-conscious admissions, a 2016 ruling in the landmark Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin II case requires that schools exhaust all race-neutral alternatives before resorting to admissions policies that include race as a factor. Universities may only craft affirmative action programs if “available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice,” the ruling states.
On Monday, the justices heard oral arguments for lawsuits against the race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard and UNC. Both schools have long argued that using race as a factor in admissions helps to ensure a racially diverse student body.
But Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action group suing the schools, alleges that eliminating advantages for applicants who are children of alumni or donors could produce a similar level of diversity among students without the need to consider race.
“Harvard now refuses to eliminate its legacy preferences or boost its socioeconomic preferences, even though both changes would make Harvard far less white, wealthy, and privileged,” SFFA lawyer Cameron T. Norris argued in the Harvard case hearing.
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch asked Ryan Y. Park, the solicitor general of North Carolina who argued on behalf of UNC on Monday, whether the school should be required to revoke preferences for legacy students and “squash players” instead of considering race.
Gorsuch expressed uncertainty on whether a school that could otherwise achieve its goal of diversity by eliminating legacy applicant benefits can pass the “strict scrutiny” standard required to allow the use of race in admissions.
“Suppose a university — a wealthy university — could eliminate those preferences which tend to favor the children of wealthy, white parents and achieve diversity without race consciousness: Would strict scrutiny require it to do so?” Gorsuch asked.
Justice Clarence Thomas began the justices’ questioning in the Harvard case by asking the University’s lawyer Seth P. Waxman ’73 to address SFFA’s argument on legacy preferences.
“The petitioner argues that you do have available a race-neutral approach that would yield different but excellent results,” Thomas said.
He added that lowering the proportions of wealthy and legacy students at Harvard could achieve socioeconomic diversity at the school.
“I don't think it's arguable that Harvard is socioeconomically diverse — at least it doesn't appear that way,” Thomas said. “That would not have a constitutional problem if you did it socioeconomically.”
Waxman argued that trading the University’s current admissions program for one that provides no advantage to legacy and donor applicants would not substantially increase the school’s diversity, citing the lower court’s ruling in favor of Harvard’s consideration of race.
“If this were a case in which the evidence showed that eliminating a legacy preference made a substantial difference, the lower courts would have decided the case differently,” Waxman said.
He argued that eliminating advantages for students who are athletes, on the dean’s interest list, or children of alumni or faculty — a category of applicants known as ALDCs — would actually decrease the proportion of Black students.
“If you just stopped considering race, it would go from 14 to six percent,” Waxman told the court. “But if you also stopped considering ALDCs, it would go to five percent.”
Following the hearings, Richard Sander ’78, a professor at University of California Los Angeles School of Law who filed an amicus brief in support of SFFA, said that Harvard’s continued preference for legacy applicants may provide the court a justification for ruling against its race-conscious admissions.
“The court can say, ‘We allow you to use racial preferences when you can show that you exhausted all the other alternatives,’” Sander said. “And if you are using legacies, then by definition, you haven't exhausted the other alternatives.”
While legacy preference was not on trial at Monday’s hearing, Boston University School of Law associate professor Jonathan P. Feingold said that if race is eliminated as a factor in college admissions, advantages for ALDC applicants would soon follow.
“It will become politically untenable for Harvard to extend bonuses that, in everything but form, are racial and class preferences for white and wealthy applicants,” he said. “Practically, the end of affirmative action could entail the end of at least formal legacy preferences.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON — Affirmative action in American higher education may be on its last leg.
The Supreme Court’s conservative majority on Monday appeared open to banning the consideration of race in college admissions during oral arguments in a pair of high-stakes anti-affirmative action lawsuits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina.
In marathon back-to-back hearings, members of the court’s conservative wing vigorously interrogated lawyers from Harvard and UNC, who argued that schools should be able to consider race as a factor in admissions.
Justices questioned the educational value of racial diversity, which lawyers representing the two schools said justifies race-based affirmative action.
“I’ve heard the word diversity quite a few times, and I don’t have a clue what it means. It seems to mean everything for everyone,” Justice Clarence Thomas told North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Y. Park, who argued on behalf of UNC. “Tell me what the educational benefits are.”
Park said diversity leads to better performance at work and school, citing studies that found diverse stock trading groups performed better than homogeneous ones.
“I guess I don’t put much stock in that,” Thomas replied, “because I’ve heard similar arguments in favor of segregation, too.”
The conservative justices’ skepticism comes as the court has become increasingly willing to revisit long-standing precedents.
Lawyers representing Harvard and UNC rejected allegations that the schools discriminate against Asian American applicants and said academia, industry, and government all benefit from increased racial diversity.
“A university student body comprising a multiplicity of backgrounds, experiences and interests vitally benefits our nation,” said Seth P. Waxman ’73, a former U.S. solicitor general who represented Harvard on Monday. “Stereotypes are broken down, prejudice is reduced, and critical thinking and problem-solving skills are improved.”
Lawyers for Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action group that first filed lawsuits against Harvard and UNC in 2014, asked justices to overturn the court’s 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger ruling, which upheld the right to consider race as a factor in admissions.
“This court should admit that it was wrong about Harvard, wrong about Grutter, and wrong about letting the poison of racial classifications seep back into education,” said Cameron T. Norris, who argued on behalf of SFFA in the Harvard case.
Affirmative action has narrowly survived several Supreme Court challenges, but the current 6-3 conservative majority appears more willing to roll back the practice. It remains unclear how far a potential ruling in favor of SFFA might reach. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76, considered a more moderate vote, has ruled against race-conscious admissions in the past, but he has been less eager to overturn precedent than some of his other Republican-appointed colleagues.
On Monday, Roberts criticized arguments laid out by Harvard and UNC. Asked by Roberts whether race could ever be a deciding factor in admissions, Waxman said it could.
“Race, for some highly qualified applicants, can be the determinant factor — just as being an oboe player in a year in which the Harvard-Radcliffe orchestra needs an oboe player will be the tip,” he said.
“We did not fight a civil war about oboe players — we did fight a civil war to eliminate racial discrimination, and that’s why it’s a matter of considerable concern,” Roberts shot back.
SFFA, founded by conservative activist Edward J. Blum, alleges that both schools discriminate against Asian American applicants by considering race in their admissions processes. Waxman faced sharp questions from Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who asked why Asian Americans score lower than other racial groups on Harvard’s “personal rating” metric, which evaluates applicants’ personality traits.
“They rank below whites, they rank way below Hispanics, and really way below African Americans,” Alito said. “What is the explanation for that?”
In his response, Waxman cited a lower court’s findings, saying that there is “no evidence of discrimination in admissions outcomes.”
Waxman said personal ratings are used by admissions officers “just as a matter of triage” and the score “fades into the background” later in the admissions process.
“It is not considered in any way once the subcommittees and committees meet,” Waxman said. “It is not the basis of admissions decisions.”
The court’s liberal justices challenged SFFA’s lawyers, offering a defense of race-conscious admissions.
“When you give your race, you’re not getting any special points,” said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92. “It's being treated just on par with other factors in the system. No one’s automatically getting in because race is being used.”
Justice Elena Kagan jousted with Norris, the SFFA lawyer, over whether race-conscious admissions would be acceptable if race-neutral alternatives failed to achieve diversity.
“I don’t think there’s any level that allows explicit racial classifications,” Norris said. “But I’m going to fight the hypothetical one more time if you’d let me.”
“I don’t think I will,” Kagan shot back, to audible laughter.
Several top Harvard administrators were present in the packed courtroom on Monday. Former University President Drew G. Faust, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, and former Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 sat side-by-side during oral arguments.
In an email to Harvard College students Monday, Khurana said “diverse learning communities are essential to the College’s mission of educating citizens and citizen leaders.”
Blum, the SFFA president, wrote in a statement that “elite universities like Harvard and UNC are diminishing, rather than growing, the power and profundity of American individualism.”
“It is a moral failure that our most competitive universities place high schoolers on racial registers and tell the world that their skin color affects what they think and know, and what they like and do not like,” he wrote.
The Supreme Court is not expected to issue its ruling on the case until the spring or early summer.

Eight years after anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions first sued Harvard for its consideration of race in admissions, the Supreme Court heard the case alongside a similar suit against the University of North Carolina.
Here are the key exchanges that took place during Monday’s oral arguments.
During opening arguments before the justices Monday, SFFA lawyer Cameron T. Norris alleged Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants by assigning them “significantly lower personal ratings” — a score that measures applicants’ character — than to any other group.
Former U.S. Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman ’73, who argued on behalf of Harvard, pointed to two lower court rulings that declared the College did not discriminate against Asian applicants in the admissions process.
“There was consistent, unambiguous, and convincing testimony there was no discrimination in the admissions process in general, and the personal rating in particular,” Waxman said.
“The record shows that Asian student applicants get the lowest personal scores of any other group,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said in response. “It has to be one of two things: It has to be that they really do lack integrity, courage, kindness, and empathy to the same degree as students of other races, or there has to be something wrong with this personal score.”
Waxman said the personal rating is assigned by an application’s first reader “just as a matter of triage,” but “fades into the background” once other admissions officers review the application.
“It is not the basis of admissions decisions,” Waxman said. “Not only did the court find as fact that that slight disparity was not evidence of discrimination, even in the personal rating, but it had no effect with respect to outcomes.”
Following Alito’s questioning, Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76 interjected to press Waxman about Harvard’s alleged racial discrimination against Asian applicants.
“So there’s only a little racial discrimination in the case?” Roberts said.
“You’re asking me to answer a question that assumes that Harvard is discriminating on the basis of race?” Waxman said. “No, I can’t accept that.”
“Isn’t that what the case is about? The discrimination against Asian Americans?” Roberts said.
Waxman agreed with Roberts that if race provides “one of many” tips, then it is “in some cases” a determining factor in admission to Harvard.
“Race, for some highly qualified applicants can be the determining factor — just as being an oboe player in a year in which the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra needs an oboe player will be the tip,” Waxman said.
“We did not fight a civil war about oboe players,” Roberts said. “We did fight a civil war to eliminate racial discrimination. And that’s why it’s a matter of considerable concern.”
“It’s important for you to establish whether or not granting a credit based solely on skin color is based on a stereotype when you say this brings diversity of viewpoint — it may not bring diversity of viewpoint in a particular case at all,” Roberts added.
Justice Clarence Thomas questioned Waxman on Harvard’s preference for “ALDCs,” an acronym used for athletes, legacy students, students on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff, citing findings in SFFA’s petition.
“They argue that you’re over 80 percent wealthy students — that’s not diverse — and that over 30 percent of a class is made up of ALDC students,” Thomas said. “If you were to lower those numbers, you could achieve far more diverse results along socioeconomic lines.”
“And I don’t think it’s arguable that Harvard is socioeconomically diverse; at least, it doesn’t appear that way,” Thomas added.
Waxman rebutted by saying that if ALDC preferences were eliminated, overall racial diversity would decrease.
“The representation of African Americans, if you just stopped considering race, would go from 14 to 6 percent. But if you also stopped considering ALDCs, it would go to 5 percent,” Waxman said.
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch questioned Waxman about a hypothetical scenario in which a “very wealthy university” were able to “pay for everybody to go and still increase its endowment.”
“Let’s say if it just gave up preferences for donors, children, legacies, and squash athletes. Or maybe those who row crew, all of which tend to favor predominantly white children, and it could achieve whatever it deemed racial diversity,” Gorsuch said. “Would it then be permitted to engage in race consciousness?”
In his response to Gorsuch, Waxman referenced Simulation D, which simulated the results of Harvard’s admissions if the College were to eliminate the consideration of race and preferences for ALDC applicants and increase preference for low-income students. A lower court found that Simulation D “was not a workable alternative.”
“The district court found that ‘the Simulation D’ would require ‘sacrifices on almost every dimension important to Harvard's admissions process,’” Waxman said.
During oral arguments, Thomas asked Ryan Y. Park, the solicitor general of North Carolina who represented UNC during oral arguments, for a “specific definition of diversity” and its educational benefits for UNC.
“I’ve heard the word ‘diversity’ quite a few times, and I don’t have a clue what it means,” Thomas said.
“We value diversity of all different kinds and all the ways that people differ in our society,” Park responded. “On the educational benefits question, Your Honor, I don’t think it was actually disputed here that there are real and meaningful educational benefits that come with diversity of all kinds.”
Thomas, who wrote a dissenting opinion in the Grutter decision, asked Park to be explicit in the benefits of diversity for a college campus.
“I’d like you to tell me expressly when a parent sends a kid to college that they don’t necessarily send them there to have fun or feel good or anything like that,” Thomas said. “They send them there to learn physics, or chemistry, or whatever they’re studying, so tell me what the educational benefits are.”
In response, Park said diverse groups of people “perform at a higher level,” working together more efficiently and with less “groupthink.”
“I guess I don’t put much stock in that because I’ve heard similar arguments in favor of segregation, too,” Thomas said.
Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor asked SFFA lawyer Patrick Strawbridge about whether race is the only factor or one of many in considering a college applicant.
Strawbridge said that college admissions is a “zero-sum game” and SFFA has “quarrels” with Grutter’s framework, which says race, if considered, must be one of many factors.
“If race is going to be encountered, that means some people are going to get in and some people are going to be excluded based on race,” Strawbridge said.
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 asked Strawbridge whether the consideration of race leads to an “actual concrete particularized injury” that would give SFFA the standing to challenge its use in college admissions.
“I’ve been struggling to understand how race is actually factoring into the admissions process here and whether there’s any actual addressable injury that arises,” Jackson said.
Strawbridge again invoked Grutter in his response to Jackson, who argued that race is never the only factor in an admission decision and sharing one’s race on an application is voluntary.
“One of the problems with Grutter that I think illustrates this specifically is Grutter’s suggestion that race can only be used as a plus factor and never a minus factor,” Strawbridge said. “That makes no sense in a zero-sum game if we are going to consider race.”
In the landmark 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s majority opinion upheld affirmative action but said the court expects the policies to “no longer be necessary” in 25 years.
During oral arguments Monday, several conservative justices questioned Park on the timeline for the end of race-conscious admissions.
“Suppose you assemble the student body in which the various racial groups coincide almost exactly to the percentage of those racial groups in the general population,” Alito said. “Would you say, ‘Okay, now we’ve done it, we’ve achieved diversity?’”
Park said that equal representation was not UNC’s goal, prompting further questioning from Barrett.
“When is your sunset? When will you know?” Barrett said. “Grutter doesn’t say, ‘This is great, we embrace this.’ Grutter says, ‘This is dangerous, and it has to have an endpoint.’ And I hear you telling Justice Alito, ‘There is no end point.’”
“I apologize if I gave that impression,” Park said in response. “We enthusiastically embrace the durational requirement, and we have tried to do everything possible to adopt race-neutral alternatives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON — During oral arguments Monday morning, Supreme Court justices pressed lawyers arguing on behalf of Harvard and the University of North Carolina on how long the universities will continue to factor race into their admissions decisions.
Monday’s hearings marked the latest chapter in the eight-year saga of anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions’ crusade against the schools’ consideration of applicants’ race. Citing a clause in the 2003 landmark case Grutter v. Bollinger, the six conservative justices on the bench demanded to hear when the two schools expect to sunset their race-conscious admissions programs.
In her opinion for the Grutter case, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor affirmed the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education, though not indefinitely.
“We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,” the Grutter ruling reads.
The conservative justices clung to O’Connor’s 25-year sentence throughout Monday’s oral arguments, repeatedly questioning the school’s lawyers on the timeline of affirmative action.
“When does Harvard anticipate this will end?” Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Harvard lawyer Seth P. Waxman ’73, echoing questions by Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
Waxman said Harvard expects that by the 25th anniversary of the Grutter ruling in 2028, race-neutral admissions policies will still not be a viable path to achieving a diverse student body. But he added the school “takes to heart Justice O’Connor’s opinion.”
When asked about his dismissal of the 25-year clause as a hard deadline, North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Y. Park, who argued on behalf of UNC, said the weight placed on race as a factor in admission acts as “a dial, not a switch” and has already diminished over the last two decades.
“We anticipate that we will be able to dial it down to zero,” he said.
Park described the Grutter case as “helpfully self-limiting” since it requires schools to actively search for alternative race-neutral admissions processes.
SFFA lawyers, who urged the court to overturn the precedent set by Grutter, offered differing interpretations of the clause in O’Connor’s opinion.
“I think what Justice O'Connor was saying is that in 25 years, if we still need race, it's not that you get another 25 years,” SFFA lawyer Cameron T. Norris told the court. “It's that we then declare racial preferences to be a failure and call it off and go with race neutrality and try that instead.”
But Norris’ colleague, Patrick Strawbridge — who earlier that day argued against UNC — said he does not believe O’Connor meant to provide a strict deadline.
Justice Kavanaugh asked Strawbridge how the court should think about “the importance of race-conscious decision-making being time-limited and temporary.”
“We do not understand the 25-year limit somehow to have been a hard and fast requirement,” Strawbridge replied. “I think that the language in Grutter had an aspirational element to it.”
While the lawyers were split on what the deadline means for the future of affirmative action, constitutional law experts are uncertain how O’Connor arrived at the 25-year limit.
“Nobody knows,” New York University School of Law professor Melissa Murray said. “Twenty-five years seemed like a good length of time.”
She added that even at the time of the Grutter ruling’s release, many were skeptical that such a deadline would be feasible.
“There were many people who were like, ‘Wait a minute, I don't think we're going to be done with racism in 25 years. It took a long time to get here. It'll probably take more than 25 years to unravel all of this,’” Murray said.
Richard Sander ’78, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, said that because the Grutter opinion came out 25 years after the previous landmark affirmative action decision — the 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke — O’Connor may have simply used the same number as an example.
But David E. Bernstein, a professor of law at George Mason University who also filed a brief in support of SFFA, wrote in an email that he believes “O’Connor made it up.”
Regardless of the anticipated timeline or the reasoning behind it, the justices and the lawyers who argued on Monday agreed that reaching a race-neutral alternative is the end goal for college admissions.
“I think everybody has agreed — all our cases indicate — that race-neutral means are better,” Justice Elena Kagan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the opening weekend of a season marked by high expectations internally and externally, the No. 14 Harvard men’s ice hockey team overcame deficits, penalties, and occasional inconsistency to secure a 2-0 start to the season with come-from-behind wins over the Dartmouth Big Green and the Princeton Tigers at Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
“Last year, I think we had 13 or 14 players playing college hockey for the first time,” head coach Ted Donato said. “So now we're a veteran group of one year with a lot of guys and some new guys, but I think we're still trying to find what our identity is going to be as a group.”
Harvard 5, Dartmouth 2
In a first period that was chippy and physical right from the opening faceoff, Harvard did not play like a team with championship aspirations, struggling against Dartmouth’s aggressive play. Less than a minute into the game, a strong Big Green forecheck pinned the Crimson in the defensive zone and allowed center Steven Townley to steal the puck from the Harvard defense. Townley quickly fed the puck from below the goal line into the high slot, where forward Matt Hubbarde collected it and fired it past senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson to give Dartmouth a 1-0 lead only 59 seconds in.
Dartmouth’s aggressive play reared its head again on their second goal of the game only minutes later. After forcing a turnover at their defensive blue line, the Big Green’s fourth line and their forecheck went to work below the goal line again. This time, Dartmouth forward Tyler Campbell was able to force a turnover and find linemate Ryan Sorkin for a point blank shot from Gibson’s left. Gibson made the save, but the rebound popped in the air and found center Trym Lokkeberg, who batted the puck out of the air and into the net to put the Big Green up 2-0. Dartmouth’s aggressive play carried over to their defense as well, as they regularly broke up the Harvard offensive attack in the neutral zone or at their defensive blue line, stymying the Crimson offense at even strength and preventing goaltender Cooper Black from facing any serious tests.
“I think on our side there’s two or three mistakes,” Donato said. “So I think with the goals they got a shot of adrenaline, they had some momentum. And I’d love to say there were a ton of tactical things that were happening…but really I just thought they outworked us and out competed us.”
Despite the poor start to the game, Harvard’s offense ignited in a second period in which they dominated play, outshooting Dartmouth 20-8. After struggling to move the puck effectively and maintain possession in the first period, the Crimson generated several scoring opportunities early in the second frame, including a prime chance for first-year forward Joe Miller, who was left alone in the slot but saw his shot denied by a spectacular save by Black. Harvard’s offense finally broke through just shy of eight minutes into the period, as a hard shot from senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun was blocked in front and landed right on the stick of junior forward Alex Laferriere, who cleaned up the rebound to cut the Crimson deficit to 2-1.
Just over two minutes later, it appeared that Dartmouth would have a prime chance to stem the Crimson momentum when senior forward Austin Wong was handed a five minute major penalty and game misconduct for making contact with the head of a Big Green player. However, Harvard’s penalty kill rose to the occasion, preventing Dartmouth from getting set up in the offensive zone. Two minutes into the penalty kill the Crimson was able to turn its strong defense into offense, as Laferriere and sophomore defenseman Jack Bar created a shorthanded odd man rush opportunity, which Bar was able to convert to tie the game at 2-2 and tally his first collegiate goal. Harvard continued to create scoring chances in the second period, including an odd-man rush opportunity between first-year forwards Marek Hejduk and Philip Tresca, but Black continued his strong play to maintain a 2-2 tie going into the second intermission.
“I think that's expected whenever we play Dartmouth,” Thrun said regarding the game’s physical edge. “We have a little bit of a rivalry with them as well and they’re a pretty physical team, and any team you see in our league is obviously gonna show up and play pretty gritty.”
The third period continued the physical play of the game, as Tresca was upended by a thunderous open ice hit and both teams delivered punishing checks along the boards. Harvard’s offense maintained its surge, however, and less than four minutes into the period, Laferriere gave the Crimson a 3-2 lead on a 2-on-1 opportunity with a wrist shot that just trickled through Black. Harvard continued its offensive onslaught on two third period power plays, and while they were unable to convert on their first opportunity, they expanded their lead to 4-2 on the second man advantage, as Laferriere, looking for the hat trick, was denied by Black off of a shot from the slot, but sophomore forward Matthew Coronato was able to knock home the rebound.
The Crimson was not seriously threatened on defense for the rest of the game, as the defense corps moved the puck well to prevent the Big Green from establishing their aggressive forecheck. Senior forward and captain Baker Shore took a hooking penalty with less than five minutes to play, but an unbelievable glove save from Gibson, sliding from his right to his left, robbed Hubbarde of a sure goal, and sophomore forward Zakary Karpa tallied an empty net goal to secure the 5-2 victory.
“At the end of the day, I thought the response from our group was pretty good,” Donato said. “You'd like to initiate more than have a response, but I think we'll learn from it and move on.”
Harvard 4, Princeton 2
After struggling to begin the season opener against Dartmouth, Harvard engineered a much stronger first period on Saturday, with the Crimson creating a number of early scoring chances. Bar hit the post on a long shot from the point and Thrun had a quality chance from the slot, but he was denied by Princeton goaltender Aidan Porter. After Tigers defenseman Noah de la Durantaye was sent off for hooking with just under eight minutes remaining, Karpa opened the scoring for Harvard on the power play by redirecting a hard shot-pass from sophomore defenseman Ian Moore into the net for the 1-0 lead. The Crimson had a golden opportunity to extend their lead after Princeton forward and captain Liam Gorman was given a five minute major penalty for boarding, but Porter kept Harvard at bay, denying prime opportunities for Thrun and Coronato to keep the Princeton deficit at one goal at the conclusion of the first period.
“Coach has been harping on us to start the games better,” Laferriere said. “We had two exhibition games which our starts were kind of lackluster, so I think we're focused on that.”
The Tigers markedly improved their play in the second frame, matching Harvard in shots on goal at nine. The Crimson power play was strong on an early man advantage but was unable to pad the lead, as a spectacular passing play from Karpa to a cutting Moore was rejected by an unbelievable effort from Porter. Soon after the early power play expired, Princeton forward Brendan Gorman tallied his first career collegiate goal after he skated into the offensive zone with speed and beat junior goaltender Derek Mullahy cleanly with a wrist shot from between the faceoff circles. Both goalies were strong in the rest of the second period as the teams accelerated the pace of play, with both Porter and Mullahy denying a flurry of chances, and the teams entered the second intermission knotted at one goal apiece.
Shortly after the third period began, the Crimson was sent to the penalty kill when senior forward Austin Wong was whistled for tripping. The Tigers wasted no time cashing in on the power play, as forward Adam Robbins sent a perfect cross ice pass to forward Jack Cronin, whose high wrist shot beat Mullahy, giving Princeton a 2-1 lead less than two minutes into the third period. However, Harvard answered with a power play goal only minutes later, as first year forward Joe Miller tapped a rebound through Porter to tie the game at 2-2. The power play helped to jumpstart the Crimson offense at even strength, and just over three minutes after Miller’s strike, Coronato gave the Crimson a 3-2 lead when he finished off a pass from junior forward Sean Farrell, who was stationed below the goal line. The Tigers had chances to tally an equalizer, especially on a power play halfway through the period, but they failed to convert their opportunities, and Coronato iced the game with just over a minute remaining when he made a nifty move on Porter to finish off a partial breakaway, securing a 4-2 win for Harvard.
“You're saying in the locker room, how you never know if a goalie’s gonna stand on their head one night or we'll be in the box for the entire game another night,” Laferriere said. “So just being able to overcome that sort of stuff is what makes championship teams and I think that's what we're focused on.”
The Crimson is back in action next weekend at Bright-Landry Hockey Center, taking on the Brown Bears on Friday evening before clashing with the Yale Bulldogs on Saturday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an offseason that saw a lot of roster turnover and the integration of many fresh faces into its lineup, Harvard women’s ice hockey was challenged early in a four-game homestand to open its 2022-23 season. It faced the monumental task of developing team chemistry while simultaneously winning games against quality opponents. Ultimately, the first four games of the season underlined just how much work the Crimson still has to do, as it managed just one victory – a shutout of Dartmouth – while suffering three setbacks, at the hands of Quinnipiac, Yale, and Brown.
Looking to rebound after a close loss its last time out, RV/RV Harvard (1-3-0, 1-3-0) played host to Brown (3-0-1, 2-0-0) on Saturday. Entering the matchup, the Crimson had not lost to the Bears since the 2016-17 season.
Brown started the contest with a one-player advantage, as first-year Indi Wagner was called for a delay of game penalty. Halfway through the power play, Brown broke through the Harvard defense. After taking a pass from junior defender Cassidy Piersiak in the neutral zone, sophomore forward Olivia Williamson skated up the ice and fired a shot into the top left corner of the net to give the Bears the lead.
Six minutes later, the Crimson got a chance to respond, as Brown senior defender Maddie Stockfish was called for a two-minute tripping penalty. Despite not converting on the power play, Harvard found its equalizer a minute later off of a shot from sophomore forward Paige Lester. Lester took the pass from senior forward Kristen Della Rovere and laced a shot into the back of the net as she fell to the ice.
Despite multiple power play opportunities for both teams across the second and third periods, neither team could muster another goal as the game went to a decisive overtime period.
In the overtime period, Brown sealed the victory after converting on a power play chance initiated by a slashing call on Della Rovere.
With a 45-32 shot advantage, the contest marked the first time so far this season that the Crimson has outshot its opponent.
Seeking to build upon the momentum from its first win of the season, Harvard played host to No. 9/8 Yale (1-0-0, 1-0-0) on Friday in the second-to-last game of its opening four-game homestand. This was the first matchup between the two teams after splitting the season series last year.
Following a third period that went down to the last second, it was the Bulldogs who escaped with a 2-1 victory over the Crimson. Yale rode the hot hand of first-year forward Jordan Ray, who scored her first two career goals in the contest.
Although the game was high-octane and filled with emotions, Harvard still has a long season with many important games before it.
“Don’t dwell on the past,” sophomore goalie Alex Pellicci said. “Gotta just look forward.”
After withstanding an early Crimson offensive to begin the first period, the Bulldogs dominated possession and kept the pressure on the Harvard defense. The Crimson defense stood strong by recording three saves and three blocked shots.
Six minutes into the first period, Harvard had a chance to strike first, as junior forward Shannon Hollands got free on a breakaway. However, the Crimson faithful had to wait to cheer as the sound of the puck hitting the pipe echoed throughout the arena.
Harvard mounted its next offensive at the ten-minute mark, which was sparked by an outlet pass from Della Rovere to senior forward Anne Bloomer. By winning multiple faceoffs and recording more shots on goal, the Crimson kept the pressure on the Yale defense, but its best chance came off a blocked shot from sophomore defender Mia Biotti. After Biotti’s shot ricocheted off a defender in front of the goal, sophomore forward Hannah Chorske and Bloomer each tried to inch the puck past the goaltender.
But after the offensive flurry resulted in nothing, Harvard’s defense surrendered the first goal of the matchup and the Bulldogs jumped out to a 1-0 lead. The goal came following a miss from Yale junior forward Elle Hartje. Hartje’s shot from the right side of the goal drifted wide left, but Ray was there to quickly tap in the puck before Pellicci could recover.
The Bulldogs kept the puck in the Crimson’s defensive third after scoring. The Harvard defense, anchored by Pellicci’s multiple saves, stayed strong. With four minutes left in the first period, the goaltender took a scary hit while covering up the puck. However, she quickly shook off the hit and stayed in the game.
“I wanted to give [the team] confidence that we could come back and win,” Pellicci said.
In response, the Crimson took control of possession and spent the final minute of the first period peppering shots on goal.
Early into the second period, Harvard had a chance to even the score off a shot from sophomore Ellie Bayard, but Yale goalie Pia Dukaric made the glove save at full extension.
The Crimson went on the power play after a tripping call eight minutes into the second period. Despite generating a few quality shots on goal, Harvard was unable to capitalize on the advantage. The Crimson moved to 0-2 on power plays in the period after the Bulldogs killed off another advantage caused by a cross-checking penalty.
Yale appeared destined to expand its lead to two goals following a line change late in the second period. A perfect outlet pass that snuck past the Harvard defense was waiting for Bulldogs senior forward Charlotte Welch as she emerged from the bench. However, Welch was unable to light the lamp, due to a brilliant save made by Pellicci. The save was just one of many in the period, as Pellicci sought to keep the Crimson in the game after the early goal.
“I try not to let things get in my head,” said Pellicci about the first-period goal.
With only one goal separating the teams, the action grew more intense in the third period. The Bulldogs went on the power play following a tripping call on senior defender Kyra Willoughby early in the period. By generating offense of its own and sending a few shorthanded shots on goal, Harvard killed the powerplay. The same story played out the second time Yale went on the power play. The Crimson ended up firing three shots on goal during the power play. Harvard was even able to draw an advantage of its own when the Bulldogs were called for hooking while defending a shot from Hollands. Yale ended up killing off the majority of the penalty by pinning the puck against the boards.
Shortly after the Crimson killed off its third penalty of the period, the Bulldogs found the back of the net for their second goal of the night. It was once again Ray who was the hero for Yale. After picking up the puck in the defensive end, the first-year carved up the Harvard defense and scored unassisted.
The Crimson continued to fight in search of some late-game heroics. Harvard’s comeback bid started following an incredible two-way effort from sophomore forward Gabi Davidson Adams. Davidson Adams deflected a shot from Ray toward Lester. Then, she took Lester’s pass and guided it into the net past Dukaric to slice the deficit in half. With a little over two minutes left in the game, the Crimson got another break as the Bulldogs were called for a minor penalty.
Della Rovere kicked off the power play by winning a faceoff and controlling the puck. The faceoff win was just one of many throughout the game for Harvard as the Crimson won the faceoff battle down the stretch to stay in the game and keep pressure on the Yale defense.
“It takes five people to win a faceoff,” Della Rovere said.
Despite firing five shots on goal and pulling Pellicci in favor of an extra skater, Harvard could not crack the Bulldogs’ stout defense. The Crimson was given one last chance to tie up the game as Yale was called for yet another minor penalty with five seconds left. As the crowd of 433 sat on the edge of their seat, the final five seconds ticked away and Yale held on to its one-goal lead.
The close game also came with milestones and recording setting achievements.
After Bloomer recorded her 100th game in the previous contest against Dartmouth, it was Della Rovere’s turn to surpass the 100-game mark.
“To reach that milestone especially with the other seniors means a lot and it is a real honor,” Della Rovere said.
Fellow captain Willoughby also surpassed the mark during the 2-1 loss to Brown on Saturday.
Over the course of the game, Pellicci recorded a career-best 53 saves, which was the third-best single-game save performance in program history. The performance came on the heels of a shutout and 40-save performance in her first two starts of the season. The Prior Lake, Minn. native has dazzled to start the season despite only appearing in three games last season.
“There’s been a lot of support from the coaches and the girls on this team that have given me the confidence to play to the best of my abilities,” Pellicci said.
Following the loss to Quinnipiac, Harvard came into the Dartmouth (0-3-0, 0-3-0) contest in search of its first win of the 2022-23 campaign.
The Crimson came out red hot, as Della Rovere scored only 11 seconds into the match after winning the opening faceoff and receiving a pass from Bloomer. The goal was the fastest score in Harvard history and the eighth fastest in NCAA history.
In the final minute of the second period, the Crimson further expanded its lead. Goals from Bayard and Bloomer gave Harvard a three goal advantage which remained intact throughout the third period.
To open the season, Harvard welcomed No. 7/7 Quinnipiac (9-0-0, 3-0-0) to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Although the Crimson holds a winning record in the all-time series, it has not secured a victory versus the Bobcats at Bright-Landry since the 2014-15 season.
Quinnipiac struck first off of a quick goal from graduate forward Lexie Adzija. Later in the first period, the Bobcats stretched their advantage to three following goals from sophomore forward Veronica Bac and first-year forward Madison Chantler.
Harvard got on the scoreboard in the waning minutes of the first period, thanks to the Bloomer-Della Rovere connection. Bloomer took possession of the puck in the Crimson’s defensive third and flung it to find Della Rovere streaking up the left side of the boards. Then, Della Rovere beat the goalie with a nifty fake to score the goal.
Graduate forward Shay Maloney scored another goal for Quinnipiac in the final minute of the second period to extend the Bobcat lead back to three. Adzija and Bloomer traded goals in the third period as Harvard was unable to drum up a comeback.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in Van Cortlandt, N.Y. the women’s cross country team, ranked No. 25 in the nation, defended their title as Ivy League champions for a second year in a row while the men’s team finished in second after falling short to Princeton by three points. Two top-ten finishers and five top-eighteen finishers, along with junior Maia Ramsden’s individual title, provided the Crimson women with the scoring depth necessary to find victory. The men’s team was led by an exceptional performance by Acer Iverson and Graham Banks, who became the Ivy League Champion and second finisher respectively.
In the 6k, Harvard’s first five finishers all placed within the top 18 spots, which led to the squad’s 54-point finish. Sophomores Ellaney Matarese and Isabelle Goldstein took 17th and 18th place with a time of 21:42.6 and 21:43 respectively, and first-year Penelope Salmon took 12th with a time of 21:32. Senior Maya Rayle came in sixth with a time of 21:11.7, and Ramsden finished in a blazing 20:42.4 to become Ivy League Champion.
The women’s team was much younger this year than the one last year after having lost several seniors, and the team adjusted their mentality accordingly.
“The seniors really knew how to set big goals, and how to communicate the importance of what it [means] to win a championship,” Ramsden said. “This year, we had to figure out for ourselves a little more, because we're all that much younger. And so I think that a difficulty we overcame during the season was how to create that mentality with the new team and the new environment.”
In addition to Ramsden and other upperclassmen stepping up to fill the roles of retired seniors, they have the advantage of being one of only a few programs in which the same coaching staff work with both the men’s and women’s squads.
“I think [the coaching staff] is a huge asset to our team,” Ramsden said. “Our coach does a really, really good job at making sure we peak at the right time and preparing us mentally and physically for the race.”
These results speak for themselves, as for the first time since 1969, Harvard runners finished 1-2 in the Ivy League men's championship meet. For the Crimson men, the top five athletes finished in the top fifteen places. Iverson was at the top of the pack, finishing first in the 8k with 23:59.3, and was trailed closely by Blanks, who finished in 24:04.1. Iverson is the 13th Harvard runner to win the Ivy League in its 80-year history and is no stranger to dominating the Ivy League; in the 2021-22 season, he won the 3k and 5 at the same meet and won the 5k and 10k at the Ivy League Outdoor Track & Field Championships. David Melville and Vivien Henz came eleventh and twelfth respectively with 24:32.9 and 24:33.4 respectively, and Ben Rosa rounded out the Crimson’s top 5 in 15th place with 24.36.9.
The Crimson entered the race with a different tactic this year; while they used to try to dominate the race fast and early, they chose to take a more relaxed approach this year, which proved to be more successful.
“We've tried to set the pace ourselves, take control of the race from the start,” Iverson said. “And we noticed that that wasn't quite working out. We were giving other teams free rides through the race, and they were just kind of profiting off of our work there. So this year, we just stayed relaxed, calm, and very patient. We let Princeton and Columbia take [the] lead for most of the race. And then right at about four miles, Graham and I separated ourselves, and as soon as we touched the front, they didn't let it go.”
Both the men’s and women’s teams are looking ahead to the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships in two weeks.
“Regionals is going to be at the same course as the championships,” Reyles said. “So I think having that experience of going through the course is going to be a useful thing.”
“We're in a nice position going into regionals this year where most of the field is going to be looking at us, instead of us looking into the top two teams in the field,” Iverson said. “We get to dictate how we want the race to play out, and it's a nice position to be in. We can make it go fast, but it's up to us.”
The Crimson will compete in the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships on November 11 and the NCAA National Championships on November 19 to round out the season.

Coming into sophomore year, I was extremely excited for house life and all the new experiences that would follow (intramural sports!). However, with the beginning-of-the-year craziness, I never got around to using my “over the normal limit of athleticness” to rack up points for Pfoho.
That all changed when I resolved to attend a volleyball B game (volley B, if you will).
The first step was to recruit others to come with me, which proved to be a more difficult task than anticipated. One friend went so far as to say, “there is quite literally nothing I’d rather do less than intramural volleyball right now.” I respected her honesty, though I was disappointed in her lack of Pfoho fervor (Pfervor, if I may). In the end, I successfully convinced one (one!) friend to join. June, you’re a trooper.
The next step was deciding what to wear, which also proved to be a more difficult task than anticipated. The struggle mainly stemmed from the fact that I had no idea how legit this operation was. While I assumed intramural volleyball B, the lowest of the low, would be pretty chill, chill at Harvard is often actively not chill. Athletic shirt or tank top? Athletic shoes or air forces? Tracksuits for warm-up?? Sweatbands????
After deciding on an outfit, my friend and I headed to the QRAC. Once we found the court and identified which team was ours (I vote jerseys for next year), the vibes were great.
Until the game actually started, and I had the first serve. (I almost passed out from fear and had to serve underhand). Luckily, Pfoho had one active cheerleader: my mom. Yes, my mom, who was visiting for the week, attended my volleyball B game. It was a great thing too because we definitely, desperately needed a cheerleader, heckler, referee, and photographer. And maybe it was my mom’s cheering (or the undercover club volleyball player) that led us to victory. All I know is that it certainly wasn’t my spikes.
Overall, intramural volleyball B was a fun break from psetting and a great way to meet more people in my house. There was a wide range of attire and ability, and everyone was extremely welcoming. I had tons of fun, saw some Cabot friends (and crushed them), and put on athletic clothes for the first time in weeks. I would certainly recommend, unless you are playing Pfoho, in which case, do not come. We need the forfeit points.
