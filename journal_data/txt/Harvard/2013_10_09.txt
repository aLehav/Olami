After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to heightened pressure from Divest Harvard and the national divestment movement, President Faust issued last Thursday a detailed letter explaining the university’s reasoning in not divesting from fossil fuels. While we support President Faust’s reasoning and maintain our opposition to divestment, we believe that only good can come of the heightened student activism surrounding climate change.
As President Faust explained in her letter and as we opined last year, divestment does not appear to be a feasible or philosophically sound option for Harvard at the moment. We do believe, however, that climate change is an urgent and international problem that merits swift, decisive action. We also believe that the national divestment movement has created the impetus to work toward that change through its organization, mobilization, and agitation of students at Harvard and across the country.
Regardless of whether we agree with Divest Harvard’s specific means to the end of a healthier environment, they deserve our thanks because they have brought climate change—and the deleterious effects that fossil fuel corporations have on the environment—to a higher level of public awareness. They have been integral in forging a national movement, and their efforts have brought attention to Harvard’s environmental footprint both within and beyond the gates of Harvard Yard. The divestment movement can and should use that tremendous public influence to achieve change toward sustainability.
For example, President Faust reasoned in her letter that divestment might seem hypocritical due to the university’s reliance on fossil fuels in our day-to-day operations. A possible new goal for activists in the divestment movement, then, might be reducing the university’s reliance on fossil fuels—which could even weaken the university’s rationale against divestment. The movement could also work toward decreasing Harvard’s direct impact on the environment by bringing to light concerns that companies wholly owned by Harvard are engaging in environmentally hazardous practices in South America. Additionally, the divestment community might focus its resources on making sure that the university use its shareholder power in fossil fuel companies to direct those companies toward more sustainable practices.
Regardless of how Divest Harvard and the national divestment movement choose to proceed, they have succeeded in mobilizing scores of students to counteract climate change, and this alone is praiseworthy. In doing so, they have created the potential to have an even greater positive impact. The story of the divestment movement at Harvard proves that even when student activism is unsuccessful in achieving its immediate goals, it cannot be ignored.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have been caught in a dilemma these past months. A dilemma is something confounded and combustible, with passions and persuasions and hope and fear pushing against its solutions. Let me see if I can put my dilemma into words, for I believe it is a dilemma a great deal of Harvard students face.
Since last February, the Class of 2014 has been buzzing obsessively—about consulting and finance, about LSAT’s and MCAT’s and TFA, and about the great question mark that lies in the post-college world. I’ve let this incessant interplay get to me: I’ve absorbed resume vocabulary words and signed up for the On-Campus Interview email list, only to discover that I quite simply don’t know what I want to do. From what I’ve seen over the past few years, too few Harvard students admit to confusion and uncertainty about their future. So many want to know quickly what they will be doing. They want their future career to have the same reputable results as their college application process did.
One of the OCI representatives told me to think about where I’d like to be in 10 to 15 years and to see how people who are in those positions got there. Huh. Perhaps, I’d like to be an English teacher. I remember every English teacher who ever taught me. Five years later, I still remember Mrs. Klebba’s ability to pull meaning from literature, to compel me to learn more about Eliot or Keats, about the music of consonants and vowels and their implications.
I’d like to affect young people’s daily lives. I love building relationships. I think education is immensely important, and not just education in the classroom. I could see myself being the equivalent of a First-Year Outdoor Program leader my whole life. There are outdoor programs I’m looking into. One prominent program leader on campus told me that I should frame the future with, “What do I want to learn in the next few years?” He said I should take programs a few years at a time, and re-assess over those increments. By contrast, Colorado State Senator Mike Johnston suggested a different question in lecture for U.S. in the World 35. He suggested we ask, “What it is you wish to change in the world,” when looking for a career.
One of my past teaching fellows once spoke to me for two hours about my future. At the top of my paper, he wrote, “Love the questions. —Rilke.” This quote has become a mantra, as it has allowed me to redefine and re-center myself amid the multifaceted monsoon that is my senior year. As I write this, I realize how many incredible advisors I’ve had these past few years. And through them, I’ve determined that the real question we should be asking is more complicated and simple than all these career conundrums.
I must ask: Is it better to be preparing for where we want to be in ten years, or who we want to be in ten years?
Ideally, I want to choose jobs that alter my future in a loving kind of way. Nine times out of 10, I want the “who I am” to be improving, not “what I am.” I want to be set up with a good heart, not a good resume. What matters is how a career will affect me—who I will become two or three years out of a job. If I am bitter, sad, self-absorbed, or incapable of sustaining powerful relationships after my first few years in any career, then I will have made a choice for the worse. Perhaps I write in cliché, but perhaps again I need to remind myself what it means to live by this cliché.
Every month since sophomore year, I’ve given myself at least 10 minutes on the steps of Widener Library to think about my experience at Harvard. The Yard always holds a weight of indefinite sameness: The people coming in and out are different as the years pass, but the Yard always expands out as a plane of grass or snow, compacted against brick buildings and Memorial Church. It is always bustling, churning. Every year, bright toddlers kick about, to be watched with smiles by college students and professors. The leaves turn yellow, red, purple. They fall. Over and over and over again without concern—without desire. In these moments, I recall that each toddling toddler, each student, each friend has a voice and life as complex as my own, as irreplaceable and yet quickly replaced. Patterns inundate this world, but we must determine the patterns that define our lives.
Such contemplations bring me to this: I must continue searching. Not just for a job, but for the better version of myself that I glimpse in long conversations, on hikes, in car rides, with family, on paper. I can only embrace the unknown with the convoluted emotions that define all of life’s transitions. But throughout this, I will love the questions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an exceptionally long and widely reported statement last week, Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust explained Harvard’s continued justification for not divesting from fossil fuels. I’m not a member of Divest Harvard, and for now, I’ll leave a more thorough response to those who know more about the campaign. But one thing about Faust’s refutation stood out to me as a glaring misrepresentation of reality. Far from a passive, un-situated, and apolitical revenue generator, Harvard’s $33 billion endowment is extremely political.
What counts as politics? A first-year student in economics might assume that politics is simply what happens in the Capitol and the White House. A historian would point out that there’s much more to politics than simply legislation and elections; gender, race, and the capitalist system are all political issues, both at work and at home. Certainly, “economics” and “finance” are never separate from politics. I don’t believe that Faust has been acting as an administrator for so long that she’s forgotten the basics of a historian’s methodology.
Yet it appears that she has. In her letter, Faust wrote, “the endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.” However, when Harvard’s endowment invests in certain industries—especially when it invests disproportionately in one industry, or invests in controversial industries—it may be trying to make money, but it is also making a political statement. Right now, by supporting fossil fuels, the endowment is advancing right-wing goals. Divestment activists want it aligned with the progressive values of Harvard University and its students.
Harvard’s investment in Agricola Brinzal is a great example of how an “economic resource” can be very much political. Last spring, as I first read news about Harvard’s Chilean timber company Agricola Brinzal, I was taking a course on the History of Modern Latin America. (I recommend it, it’s a really well taught and interesting Gen Ed!) We learned about the history of U.S. colonialism in Latin America, and then the more recent history of neocolonialism, especially by multinational U.S.-based corporations encouraged by free trade policies to engage in natural resource speculation. At Harvard, this sort of study is not simply academic—because Harvard itself is entangled in some of these multinational corporations engaging in natural resource speculation.
Harvard’s endowment managers might view the process of turning Chile’s native forest into timber plantations as economic progress. But it would be hard to argue that whatever economic benefit Harvard gets from its timber plantations in Latin America—which are situated within a political context of neocolonialism—is apolitical.
Of course, it’s sickly ironic that much research and learning done at Harvard is directed towards fighting the very systems that Harvard supports with its endowment. Tim DeChristopher, climate activist and Divinity School student, wrote last week that in her statement, Faust “touts all the great research on climate change that is done at Harvard, but she ignores the fact that the fossil fuel industry actively works to suppress or distort every one of those efforts.” The work of the Belfer Center, the Center for the Environment, and the Harvard School of Public Health to expose the dangers of climate change becomes helplessly meaningless when that research is funded by an endowment that depends on fossil fuel investments and the deforestation of native forests.
If Faust and Harvard’s endowment managers have not recognized the political nature of the endowment, student activists have. When students organized for Harvard to divest its endowment of companies profiting from an apartheid system in South Africa, and from a genocide in Darfur, they wanted the university to make a positive and progressive statement with its endowment. In all those cases, it (eventually) did. By retaining its investments in fossil fuel corporations despite student demands, Harvard is also sending a political message.
Perhaps Faust envisioned her letter as the defining statement on university fossil-fuel divestment, a letter that other university presidents can cite and quote when attempting to respond to student activists on their campuses. It is certainly feasible for universities to divest their endowments from fossil fuels, and even to reinvest in sustainable growth and renewable energies. Joshua Humphreys, former Harvard lecturer and current fellow at the Tellus Institute, lays out multiple feasible processes for doing so in a report entitled, “Institutional Pathways to Fossil-Free Investing.”
Faust’s should not be the last word on divestment. In fact, her argument is flawed from its foundation. Harvard’s investments have always been making a political statement—it’s time to turn that to a progressive politics of climate justice, and the best way to do that is to divest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The current government shutdown is a result of Congress’s inability to pass a spending bill. More specifically, it is a result of the Republican-majority House of Representatives demanding that the spending bill defund or delay the Affordable Care Act and the Democratic-majority Senate’s unsurprising refusal to agree to these terms. This is a showcase of how political ideology is currently trumping policy implementation in Washington. The Supreme Court declared the ACA constitutional, and its implementation as law has already begun. Unable to accept this fact, Republicans have used every chance to push back. In addition to refusing to fund important government services, they have jumped at the opportunity to use the portion of the Supreme Court’s decision that declared Medicaid expansion unconstitutional to fight against this law, a tragic bit of political theatre that will broaden the very population of uninsured Americans that the ACA hoped to shrink.
One of the ACA’s main provisions is the expansion of state Medicaid eligibility, which allows a greater number of people to receive this government aid. Another key feature is the Health Insurance Marketplace, better known as the state-run health insurance exchange, which opened for enrollment on October 1, the first day of the government shutdown. It allows people who are 100 to 400 percent above the Federal Poverty Level to compare private health plans and buy affordable, fitting health coverage. These two provisions work together quite well for individuals below the FPL and thus ineligible for the exchanges, for they would be covered through the expanded Medicaid. This helps achieve the ACA’s main goals: reducing the number of uninsured Americans, making health care nearly universal, and making it affordable.
However, the Supreme Court’s decision about the constitutionality of the Medicaid expansion allowed some Republican states to use this decision as a tool to hurt their tax-paying citizens. The ACA’s Medicaid expansion initially dictated every state to expand its Medicaid coverage or completely lose its existing federal funding for the program.  The court ruled that it was “unconstitutionally coercive”—therefore, Medicaid expansion would still be an option for states that wish to expand, but expansion is no longer mandatory. As a result, 16 governors oppose expansion and 26 states currently do not have plans to expand their Medicaid coverage.
As a result, individuals who fall under 100 percent of the FPL are unable to receive subsidies in the exchange market, and if those people live in states that are not expanding Medicaid, they will not be able to receive Medicaid either—as of now, only people at or below 138 percent of the FPL are eligible. In what was supposed to be a policy implementation that would expand coverage, Republican governors are using their state rights to fight against the policy, disregarding their disadvantaged citizens who would need the expansion in order to qualify. As a result, these states have created a pool of poor people who will continue to be uninsured simply because their state refused to expand Medicaid.
Since the federal government is covering 100 percent of the expansion for the first five years of implementation, the monetary aspect of the expansion is not an issue for a majority of the states. In fact, it is strategically unwise for a state not to expand its Medicaid, for its citizens will not receive the benefits for which their taxes are paying. In a fight of political ideology, these states are perpetuating their citizens’ ill access to health insurance out of spite for a law with which they disagree.
This point is reinforced by some states that refuse to even administer the health care exchanges, which are also fully funded by the federal government. Some states, such as Florida, are putting in extensive effort to stop their citizens from receiving cheap health insurance from the exchanges, going as far as barring specially trained outreach counselors from assisting people. Thankfully, the federal government has the power to and will administer them in the states that will not offer them. This does not excuse the irrationality of refusing to allow your citizens access to health insurance.
While the Republicans are under heat for causing the government shutdown and fruitlessly attempting to repeal the ACA a whopping 42 times, a critical issue that has received little attention is Republican governors’ neglect for disadvantaged individuals who would benefit from Medicaid expansion. Even though these people will be exempt from the individual mandate because they will be unable to afford private insurance, it is unfortunate that the political stances’ of their home states will deny them access to quality health care. Although the court ruled justly in stating the federal government cannot coerce a state to implement a policy, it is economically unwise and morally corrupt to refuse to expand Medicaid to the citizens who need it the most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Robert Kegan and associate professor Meira Levinson mapped out a case for the relationship between education and improved social relations in a pair of lectures at Tuesday evening’s Askwith Forum.
The flagship event of the school’s “Teaching and Learning Week,” the discussion provided a thorough exploration of the mechanics of metacognition, which Dean of the School of Education James E. Ryan characterized as a central objective of the week’s reflections. 
Both projects by Kegan and Levinson employed new digital technology that allowed for better group dynamics, which facilitate better teaching and learning.
Kegan, a psychologist whose research and teaching concern the theory of adult development, described his central research interest of the past 35 years as a psychological technique in which guided introspection reveals emotional and logical contradictions that create barriers for people’s pursuit of goals.
This technique, he argued, has helped his clients and students “grow in adult years, not just put on weight.” 
Hoping to build on the popularity of his class on this topic, Keegan is preparing to offer the course online through edX this spring. The course has already registered more than 24,000 prospective students and is the first virtual course to be offered by the School of Education. 
The new digital platform will allow Keegan to evaluate the effectiveness of his system and teaching strategies by examining the data that emerges from his online course, while also allowing for the application of his paradigm to “whole communities taking the course together.”
Levinson, a political philosopher and former middle school teacher whose work explores the relationship between education and civic engagement, described the application of her “normative case-studies” to the development of open conversation on a group’s core values.
Using a digital interface through which large groups of participants could voice their individual opinions without disruption, Levinson’s technique informed the group of the many distinct moral axioms of its members. 
Levinson said that this approach allows a group member “to realize that when others take action with which we fundamentally disagree, it’s not that they have some horrible ideology that’s perverting their understanding.” 
Levinson admitted that this discussion will not necessarily allow groups to reach consensus, but she said she hopes that allowing a  group to understand itself better will ultimately result in improved choices.
After the event, audience member Marcy M. Murninghan said she was excited by the speakers’ projects because they show how educational paradigms can teach how “we need to organize as citizens.”

Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and UC Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14 presented on Tuesday a UC-administered student opinion survey to the task force assembled to review University email privacy policy in the wake of last spring’s email search scandal.
The meeting was one of several efforts by the task force to reach out to students, faculty, and staff to better understand how different community members feel about email privacy. The task force, composed of 14 professors and deans from across the University, is expected to complete its work by the end of the fall semester and present its recommendations to University President Drew G. Faust by January.
During Tuesday’s presentation, Raghuveer and Zhu highlighted some of the results of their 12-question email privacy survey, which was administered online and drew responses from 251 undergraduates. According to Zhu, the survey showed that many respondents were not very aware of Harvard’s privacy policy governing student email accounts, but once presented with the policy, most respondents thought it was clear.
In addition, more than 98 percent of respondents reported that students should at some point be notified about an administrative search of their account, and 63 percent said students should be notified prior to a search.
Law School professor David J. Barron ’89, the chair of the email privacy policy task force, wrote in an email Tuesday that the task force was “impressed” by the UC’s presentation.
“Among other things, the UC presentation conveyed clearly the important role transparency can play in reinforcing trust in any policy regarding electronic communications,” wrote Barron, a former Crimson President.
Raghuveer and Zhu said that after their presentation, they fielded questions from task force members on a variety of issues. Task force members asked whether Raghuveer and Zhu believe there should be a University-wide email privacy policy or whether there should be specific policies for different groups, and, if so, who should be authorizing these searches, according to Raghuveer and Zhu.
“It was encouraging to hear how focused a lot of the particular task force members were on ensuring that the student perspective was well-represented in their discussions,” Raghuveer said in an interview with The Crimson after the meeting.
The meeting comes six months after the UC unanimously approved a resolution expressing “tremendous concern” over revelations that Harvard administrators conducted secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts in connection with the Government 1310 cheating scandal. In the same resolution, the UC requested that UC representatives be present for a meeting of the email privacy task force, a request that was fulfilled by Tuesday’s meeting.
Although there has been no indication that administrators probed student email accounts in connection with the email search scandal, student fears were stoked when rumors spread that the Office of Student Life had been tracking student listservs in the hours before River Run festivities—a claim that administrators firmly denied.
Soon after, the UC drafted a memorandum on Harvard’s undergraduate email privacy policy, recommending that administrators make the policy more specific and more accessible. The memo also requested that administrators divulge the number of times student emails have been searched in the past.
Following the drafting, Raghuveer and Zhu presented the memo to Barron, who recommended that Raghuveer and Zhu provide a more precise picture of student concerns about the email policy. This recommendation led to the creation of the student opinion survey that was presented Tuesday.
The task force’s private meeting Tuesday with Raghuveer and Zhu comes before the first of two scheduled open community meetings for the group this month, with the first one slated for Wednesday at Harvard’s Longwood campus. The task force has also launched an online discussion blog for community members to share their thoughts on email privacy policy at Harvard.

The New York Times journalists behind the documentary “Hers to Lose: Inside Christine Quinn’s Bid for Mayor” joined the campaign strategists featured in the film to discuss the making of the documentary at the Institute of Politics Tuesday night.
Quinn, a Speaker of the New York City Council, was an early favorite to replace New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, but was ultimately defeated in the Democratic primary by New York City Public Advocate Bill de Blasio. The film is the second installment in the “Times Documentary” series.
In an interview with The Crimson before the event, Richard L. Berke, a senior editor and director of video content for the Times, discussed the complicated relationship between the filmmakers and the campaign staff.
“We’re kind of natural adversaries, the press and the campaign,” said Berke, who also moderated the panel. “But I think we trusted them that they would give us the access we wanted and they trusted us that we weren’t going to do a hit job and that we were going to be fair in our approach.”
Throughout the event, the panelists addressed the challenges Quinn faced in her campaign, including her possible election as the city’s first female and first openly gay mayor.
“Most people do not vote for a candidate because they are a woman or because they are gay,” Josh Isay, a strategist for Quinn’s campaign, said. “It can certainly be a factor in it, but it is not the determining factor.”
Another issue the panelists faced was Quinn’s support for extending the mayoral term limits from two four-year-long terms to three.
Mike Morey, the Quinn campaign’s communications director, said the campaign team knew that term limits were an issue on which many people would base their votes, but added that Quinn “is not someone who runs away from the decisions that she makes”.
Morey and the other panelists said they believed the documentary showed a more “human” side to campaigning.
“I think the service that’s presented here is presenting a side of these candidates—the human side—that never gets covered because our political coverage has moved into such a horse-race mentality that all we do is look at the battle, the war, the polls that are up, the polls that are down, and we don’t do a lot of focus on the individuals who sacrifice a lot to do this,” Morey said.
Students who attended the panel discussion echoed similar sentiments.
Rebecca A. Gonzalez-Rivas ’16, a student who said she was involved in the IOP, agreed, noting that the event “did an excellent job of showing the humanity side of politics and the person behind the campaign.”
Joanne Dynak ’16, another student at the event, said that “voters and communities alike would really benefit from having more documentaries like this in the future and combining that with their understanding of political issues to become more educated voters.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 14, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Richard L. Berke’s position at the New York Times. In fact, Berke is senior editor and director of video content, not an assistant managing editor.

A subcommittee composed of several members of the Academic Integrity Committee has convened to begin the drafting process for what would be Harvard’s first-ever honor code, with plans to have a draft complete by the start of November, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris confirmed Tuesday.
A five-point proposal for the honor code presented to faculty last spring would establish, among other points, a second judicial board, distinct from the Administrative Board and populated by both students and faculty, that students accused of academic dishonesty could choose to hear their case. The proposed honor code would also require students to write a “declaration of integrity” on major exams and assignments. It is unclear how closely the honor code now being drafted will resemble last spring’s proposal.
The subcommittee tasked with drafting the honor code is composed of several administrators and students who plan to meet on a regular basis throughout October, according to Terah E. Lyons ’14, a subcommittee member who also sits on the larger Academic Integrity Committee.
“We have a really strong, necessary cacophony of voices in constructing this policy,” Lyons said of the subcommittee. “It’s also really nice to see students and administrators and faculty alike come together and really work as a team.”
The draft the subcommittee plans to create will not be final. After the first draft is constructed, it will be brought to the Academic Integrity Committee, Lyons said, adding that students will also be consulted for feedback.
Olivia Z. Zhu ’15, a member of both the Academic Integrity Committee and the subcommittee, said she thinks it is important that students are involved in the process of forming an honor code, adding that she “very much believe[s] in what the honor code stands for.”
The Academic Integrity Committee was first convened in fall 2010, but its efforts were accelerated in the past year with the unfolding of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest cheating case in recent memory. In August 2012, administrators announced that the Administrative Board was investigating roughly 125 students for plagiarism or inappropriate collaboration on a take-home exam. Roughly 70 students were ultimately required to temporarily withdraw from the College in connection with the scandal.
Seven months after the cheating case was announced, Harris, who chairs the Academic Integrity Committee, presented the committee’s honor code proposal at a faculty meeting. Since then, administrators have made moves to continue the ongoing conversation about academic integrity. In late April, administrators hosted a series of meetings in the Houses to solicit student feedback on the honor code proposal. And this Thursday, faculty members, including Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister and Cabot Co-House Master Rakesh Khurana, will lead a discussion about academic integrity at Harvard called “Doing Good Work in a Noisy, Messy World.”

UPDATED: October 9, 2013, at 11:53 p.m.
Cabot Library and the Science Center atrium that surrounds it will undergo renovations designed to foster technologically driven teaching and learning while more closely linking the library with neighboring spaces and initiatives, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced in an email to faculty on Wednesday.
Though an unnamed donor has been secured for the project, FAS spokesperson Colin Manning said that the size of the gift and a timetable for the project have not yet been determined.
In addition to modernizing the interior of the 40-year-old library, the renewal will also aim to better take advantage of the building’s atrium as a social space. To that end, the renovation will make it easier to access the Science Center courtyard, reimagine the Greenhouse Cafe, and connect the structure to the newly renovated Science Center Plaza.
“The Cabot Science Library is ripe for re-imagining, and its prime location in the heart of the Science Center offers an opportunity to serve as an undergraduate teaching, learning, and research support hub for all the disciplines now requiring digital resources,” Smith said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette.
The newly renovated library will maintain current physical collections and give greater emphasis to digital and collaborative learning methods. The space could include the creation of a new “visualization lab” and a “commons” for digital media research. The project is also designed to better connect the three-story library with its neighbors and potential collaborators within the Science Center—Harvard University Information Technology, FAS Physical Resources, and the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning.
“We envisage a center for technology-based learning that will allow our students and faculty to take full advantage of the digital resources that new technologies provide, not just for the sciences, but for scholarship in and across all areas of academic inquiry,” Jeremy Bloxham, dean of the FAS Division of Science, told the Gazette.
Smith has formed a faculty committee to advise him on the project, which will be led by romance languages and literatures professor Jeffrey Schnapp. The selection process of an architect for the project has begun, to be followed by an assessment of building conditions of the Science Center and surrounding spaces.
The renovation is the latest piece of the University’s Common Spaces initiative, and comes just two and a half weeks after Harvard publicly launched a $6.5 billion capital campaign. The gift is one of a series of pledges funding FAS-designated projects in advance of the launch of the public phase of the FAS campaign slated for Oct. 25-26.

Shake Shack is set to shake up Harvard Square.
According to Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti, construction began this week on the new location at 92 Winthrop St., and although the date has yet to be finalized, Garutti predicted the restaurant will likely open towards the end of this year.
He added that the Shake Shack in the Square will probably continue the company’s trend of opting for quiet openings in lieu of elaborate fanfare.
“In general, we like to come in and have everybody get to know the place and experience it on their own,” Garutti said.
Harvard Square is the second Boston location for the New York-based company founded in 2004. A location in Chestnut Hill opened in March 2013.
Garutti said that Harvard Square came up as the first place where Shake Shack wanted to open in the Boston area.
“We were looking at a number of sites and never found one that felt right until this one,” he said. “We think that Cambridge and Harvard Square is just such a special place to have a business.”
Shake Shack is no stranger to owning a restaurant in a college town. The chain operates locations near University of Miami, Yale, and Columbia.
With construction underway at the Harvard location, Garutti said that the company is “fortunate to start to have this Ivy League connection, and we’re excited for it.”
The restaurant will seat 108 guests with a total occupancy of 144, according to Greg Waters, senior manager of marketing and communications. The location will most likely feature outdoor seating as well, Waters said.
Projected plans for the Harvard Square menu include local beers and frozen custard “concretes” unique to the Cambridge location. Five percent of the sales for one such “concrete” will be donated to a charity in the area. Garutti added that the company is spending the upcoming months working on specific programs, as they plan to enact “some fun things to be really connected to the Harvard community.”
Garutti anticipates that the Shake Shack in the Square “will ultimately mirror the Harvard-Cambridge community. It’ll be for students, for kids, for families, for professors, for workers in the area, and for people who come to visit Cambridge on the weekends.”
Shake Shack joins existing burger staples--Bartley’s, b.Good, and Flat Patties—and a more recent arrival—Tasty Burger. Garutti said that Shake Shack’s recipe diverges from its competitors in the quality of the customer experience as well as the caliber of the food.
“Shake Shack has always been about taking what fast food ruined over the last 60 years and resetting the conversation on that,” he said. “People don’t know what to call us because it’s not fast food, it’s more fine-fast or fine-casual.”
Zachary M. Dinan ’17 echoed Garutti’s sentiments. Having frequented multiple Shake Shack locations in New York City, Dinan called the restaurant “a very good version of fast food gourmet.”
“There are definitely some good burger places in Harvard Square, but none that really fit the particular description of having really good food and having it really fast,” he said, adding that the quick turnaround time at Shake Shack will be convenient for students who want to grab a meal between classes.
“Shake Shack, wherever it’s gone around the world, has become a community gathering place,” Garutti said. “And that’s how we want people to use it here at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 10, 2013, at 12:38 a.m.
Chemistry professor emeritus Martin Karplus ’51 was one of three researchers to win the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Wednesday.
Karplus, along with Michael Levitt of Stanford University and Arieh Warshel of the University of Southern California, won this year’s prize for developing computer simulations using classical physics and quantum mechanics that could improve scientists’ understanding of complex reactions and lead to the development of new drugs.
“I think this Nobel Prize is important,” said Karplus during a press conference Wednesday. “Obviously it’s very nice for me and my co-winners, but the real importance is the following: that unlike many Nobel Prizes, this means something for the field in which I work.”
He began developing his methodology in the 1970s, and described the award as “really the consecration of [his] work in the field.”
As a joint winner, Karplus will get a share of the $1.2 million that comes with the prize.
Karplus now studies the electronic structure, geometries, and dynamics of chemical and biological molecules, according to his biography on the website of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. He focuses on using microscopic approaches to solve problems in solution chemistry and also studies enzyme reactions and the effects of mutations on proteins and nucleic acids.
Although Karplus started his research by testing smaller and simpler systems, he said his methods are now being used to help calculate the motion of atoms in proteins.
According to Karplus, his research has been used in health fields in ways ranging from helping design ligands to inhibit enzymes, to finding inhibitors for amyloid fragments--proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
Karplus, who was born in Austria in 1930, said he developed a love for science at an early age. After moving to the United States and attending Harvard as an undergraduate, Karplus began to narrow his academic interests.
“I realized what I really wanted to do was understand biological systems,” Karplus said. “The only way to do this was to do chemistry and physics because all of what goes on in us is governed by chemistry and physics.”
As a Ph.D. student at the California Institute of Technology, Karplus was the last graduate student to work under two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, who was known for his research in chemical bonds and complex structures.
During the press conference, Karplus encouraged prospective chemists to “be courageous” and think deeply about the questions biology has the potential to answer.
“Originality and hard work are the two things that are really important,” he said. “There are many exciting problems in biology, but for many of them you can’t do anything with our [existing] methods.... And so a very important part in working in this area is realizing not only that a problem is interesting, but that what we can do can actually give answers that are important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been two years since a soccer game between Harvard and Boston University has finished in regulation, and it will now be even longer. Just like the men’s team two weeks prior, the Harvard women’s soccer team found itself in an overtime bout with the Terriers.
In the end, neither side could pull away, as the two teams played to a tightly contested 1-1 draw.
“It was a really good game,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. ” I mean BU’s a fantastic team, so it was an incredibly competitive battle—just a physical battle.”
Harvard (6-3-2) knew that it was in for a battle when the team took the field at Nickerson Field Tuesday night. The Terriers (8-3-2) have yet to lose a game on their own turf this season. In fact, BU had yet to surrender a goal at Nickerson all season. The last opponent to score on the road against the Terriers was Albany, back on Sept. 23 of last season.
That streak came to an end on Tuesday night by way of the foot of a Crimson freshman. In the 28th minute, with the Terriers leading 1-0, the Crimson launched a quick counter-attack. Junior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby sprinted up the left wing and sent a through ball to freshman forward Midge Purce.
Purce took the ball up to the left side of the box before fooling a BU defender with a cutback move.
From the edge of the box, Pierce looked like she was about to send a short cross in front. However, she fooled the BU defender once again with another cutback—this time to the left—before moving towards the goal line. Utilizing the open space, Pierce launched a shot on the ground that snuck inside the left post past sprawling BU keeper Andrea Green.
The equalizing goal was the seventh of the season for the freshman and could not have come at a better time for Harvard, as the Terriers had been dominant to that point.
For the first 30 minutes of the match, BU held a strong advantage in possession as they thoroughly controlled play on Harvard’s side of the pitch.
Twelve minutes into the game, the Terriers got on the scoreboard when senior midfielder Megan McGoldrick found herself in the right place at the right time.
After the ball squirted out from a scrum of players on the left side of the penalty area, McGoldrick earned an open look at the net from the middle of the box. With plenty of time to shoot, McGoldrick picked the top right corner, leaving Crimson goalkeeper Lizzie Durack with no chance to make a save.
“I think we just have to learn that those things are going to happen,” Harvard senior co-captain Elizabeth Weisman said. “Sometimes you get in rhythms, and they had a rhythm in the beginning.
The Terriers went into the break leading the Crimson in shots 8-3.
Harvard certainly rebounded in the second half and the overtime periods, though, as the team began to hold BU while creating its own attacks. However, in the end, there were very few scoring opportunities for either side as the game went on.
“They just locked in,” Leone said of his team. “They defended really hard and tried to catch [BU] on counters, and we had some opportunities, [but] BU defended them really well. They didn’t give us many looks, that’s for sure.”
Holding the Terriers’ offense to one goal was no easy task. BU launched 13 shots over the course of the game, but Durack and junior goalkeeper Cheta Emba, who split time in net, stood their ground.
However, it was the Crimson defense, led by senior co-captain Peyton Johnson, that truly secured the draw for Harvard.
“They were rock,” Leone said. “They had to absorb so many things—all the set pieces, the corner kicks, the flow of the play. The back line was unbelievable. So I’m really proud of how hard they played and how together they played.”
The Terriers earned eight corners and eight free kicks, but each one was staved off by the Crimson back line. Harvard did especially well to shut down BU forward Madison Clemons, who was named Patriot League Player of the Week after scoring three goals this past week. She finished with four shots—none on goal.
With the tie, the Crimson extends its unbeaten streak to eight games.
“I think it’s awesome showing them on their own field that we have what it takes, and [that] we are able to compete with them and show them that we’re good this year,” Weisman said. “We have great depth and great players, and we really wanted it today, so we showed that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A stalemate between the Harvard women’s soccer team and BU ended the Crimson’s six game winning streak at Nickerson Field Tuesday night.
Without seeing a goal for the final sixty minutes of the match, Harvard (6-3-2) and the Terriers (8-3-2) went into double overtime before ending the game in a tie, 1-1.
SHOTS ON GOAL
For the first time this season, Harvard did not outshoot its opponent. BU edged out the Crimson in shots, 13-6. Harvard registered two shots on goal, while the Terriers snuck in four shots on frame.
“We were just going to play, and that’s what we did,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “I think there [were] moments where they captured the game, and they were dictating their style more than we were, but at the same time, we had our opportunities too.”
Senior forward Madison Clemens led BU in shots with four attempts, but senior midfielder Megan McGoldrick tallied the Terriers lone goal of the match.
Harvard recorded the final shot of the game in double-overtime, when junior defender Marie Margolius’s attempt went wide of the frame in the 105th minute.
The second overtime marked the only period in which the Crimson outshot BU. In the game’s opening half, Terriers registered eight shots to Harvard’s three attempts.
Freshman forward Midge Purce pocketed the Crimson’s only goal on  the night. After beating her defender one-on-one from the left side, the freshman found the back of the net in the 27th minute.
The score is the seventh of the season for the highly-touted rookie from Maryland as she is quickly becoming a mainstay on Harvard’s front line. Her fifteen points this year—she is averaging greater than one per contest—are best on the team and put her near the top of the Ivy League.
Purce’s goal came fifteen minutes after McGoldrick ripped a shot from inside the 18-yard box to put BU up in the 12th minute.
A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY
Knotting the score might be a new tradition between Harvard and the Terriers, since the two teams tied, 2-2, last season on the Crimson’s turf.
The 2012 game also included two overtime periods, although both squads registered roughly twice as many shots in last season’s game as compared to the 2013 season matchup.
Stalemates have not been unusual in the past, with the Crimson edging out the Terriers in the overall matchup record, 6-5-5.
“I think we really matched up to a great BU team, and we showed them that we could stick with them throughout the whole game,” co-captain forward Elizabeth Weisman said.
While Harvard may have seen its winning streak broken, the Crimson did manage to score the first goal this season against the BU defense on its home turf. Before Tuesday night’s match against Harvard, it had not happened since last September.
LAST LINE OF DEFENSE
Splitting time in goal for the contest, freshman Lizzie Durack and junior Cheta Emba registered two and one save, respectively. Durack started the match and fell just two saves shy of her career high of four.
Emba shut out the Terriers in the second half, registering a save and bringing her season total to seven.
BU had senior Andrea Green in between the pipes for the entirety of the game, with the Terriers goalkeeper tallying just a single save from the Crimson’s two shots on goal.
“I think we feel good,” Weisman said. “I think that we’re just looking to Cornell, just focusing on one game at a time, so we went through today, and now it’s all about focusing on Cornell and keeping that unbeaten streak.”
Two ties bookend six Harvard wins, bringing the “unbeaten streak” to eight contests.
“We’re just trying to improve,” Leone said. “I don’t think about any of that stuff. All I think about is just making sure that they’re improving every single day and focusing on whatever the next game is.”
Of the past eight matchups, only two have been against Ivy League teams—Penn and Yale. Facing Cornell in New York this weekend, the Crimson hopes to maintain an untarnished record in the conference.

With the turning of the seasons and the upcoming three-day weekend, now is a better time than ever to get off campus and enjoy a break from studying for those midterms. Here are some suggestions for how to make the most of your long weekend.
Apple Picking
 Check out this fun guide to all the popular spots for apple picking, wagon rides, fifty-cent apple cider donuts, and much more. Although such attractions will be open throughout the fall season, Columbus Day Weekend is an optimal time to check out fall foliage and enjoy some fresh air and good company.
Walden Pond
 You made have heard of Henry David Thoreau, who coincidentally studied at Harvard College (Class of 1837). From July 1845 to September 1847, Thoreau made Walden Pond his humble abode, and the pond and surrounding area is now a Massachusetts State Reservation located only 14 miles from campus. Whether you want to canoe, hike, or just enjoy a picnic on the beach, this weekend is one of the best times to enjoy the same peace and quiet that Thoreau reveled in nearly 200 years ago.
 
The Freedom Trail
 Celebrate the "discovery" of the Americas and take a 2.5-mile stroll through Boston, stopping by the Freedom Trail’s 16 historical spots, including Paul Revere's home and the site of the Boston Massacre.
 
Shopping
 Because who doesn't love Columbus Day sale prices? Check out Newbury Street, the Shops at the Prudential Center, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, or the North End for some great steals. If you're not interested in lugging shopping bags through the city, Harvard Square and CambridgeSide Galleria also have some great shopping options closer to home.
 
Columbus Day Parade
 Featuring "an eclectic mix of marching brass bands, military units and Colonial militias, Italian-Boston organizations, Duck Boat floats, politicians, other entertainers, and even vintage autos," the renowned New England parade kicks off Sunday, October 13 at approximately 1 p.m. in the North End.

To quote the wise poet Jay-Z, "Somewhere in America, Miley Cyrus is still twerking." To be even more specific, somewhere in Harvard, Miley Cyrus is not only twerking but is also taking over any and all aspects of college life. Current "Disney-stars-gone-rogue" concentrators have been grappling with properly classifying and labeling this recent cultural trend and have attempted to chronicle its existence with titles like "The Miley Plague," "The Cyrus Infection," "The Apocalypse," and "The Life and Death of Hannah Montana." But haters cannot deny that from the incessant appearance of "We Can't Stop" on seemingly every final club's playlist (we all see your ploy to get girls to twerk) to Miley references in, dare we say, the classroom itself, we at Harvard really just can't stop.
Dining hall conversations overheard even as early as breakfast go something like this:
"My entire entryway watched Miley on 'SNL' last night."
"In Philosophy 3, it's not the id or the ego, but the Hannah or the Miley."
"No, you can't be Miley Cyrus for Halloween. I already bought my slutty teddy bear outfit."
It all culminated in this week's Math 21a midterm review session in Science Center B. Tired students milled about the room, looking for seats as preceptor Oliver R. Knill set up his presentation. The review session began, equations and formulas lit up the giant projector screen, and students settled in for the next 90 minutes.
At T-45 minutes, the booming sound of "Wrecking Ball" blasted throughout the lecture hall as Miley Cyrus—presented in her entirety by using the functions and tools of the calculus program "Mathematica"—swung dramatically on a spherical gray mass. Miley reappeared two more times in the session, sans clothing and sans explanation.
Sula B. Ndousse-Fetter '17, who observed the incident, wrote in an email, "The Miley Cyrus appearance was definitely unexpected. I know she's pretty big right now, but I'm not sure how I feel about seeing a parametrized 3D  Miley Cyrus swinging over campus. I can say it lightened up the mood in the Math 21a review session though!"
In conclusion, it seems that what had previously been considered a transitory fad is now all too legitimate: MC no longer stands for Multivariable Calculus, but for Miley Cyrus.

Yesterday, The Atlantic published an article asking what the draw was for students taking Ethical Reasoning 18: "Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory." Here are some things they didn’t think of:

It’s easy!
 Last year, ER 18 managed to score a mere 1.58 on the Q Guide’s workload rating, and many comments mentioned that it was low stress. The syllabus says the course discusses how the Chinese “wrestled” with moral and ethical issues, but really, the only things you’ll be wrestling with are your alarms before the 10 a.m. lectures.
 
Who knows, it just might change your life.
 With a promise like that from Puett (as quoted in The Atlantic), it’s no surprise so many students decide to take the class. Fewer and fewer of them may be showing up to lecture, but perhaps it is helping them cultivate an inner sense of zen... at least, until section rolls around and they haven’t done any of the readings.
Puett.
After studying some oracle bones, we’ve discovered that Puett is a pretty cool guy. An enthusiastic lecturer and knowledgeable professor, he seems like the perfect person to take a Gen Ed class with.
Really, it’s easy.
After all, when was the last time you got enough sleep?
What do Ivy League schools look for in an applicant other than grades or test scores?
While grades and test scores are important, colleges take many other factors into account. Essays, awards, arts supplements, positive teacher recommendations, extracurriculars, work experience, and summer activities are all important parts of your college essays that should not be overlooked. Qualities that admissions officers look for include intellectual curiosity, initiative, thoughtfulness, and leadership. When applying to top-tier schools, a stellar transcript is by no means a guarantee of admission. But by the same token, this "holistic" admissions process also ensures that a few academic slip-ups don't bar the way for an otherwise superbly qualified student.
In general, top-tier schools are looking to put together a well-rounded class with a diversity of passions, talents, perspectives, and interests. Typically, admits fall into two categories: "well rounded" and "well lopsided." "Well lopsided" students are those who found their passion early on and have demonstrated their interest by hard work and, subsequently, success in whatever particular field they enjoy, whether that be biology or bee-keeping. Still others are "well rounded," meaning that they find interest in many different areas and have cultivated their interests to excel in many different fields.
Is  it risky to send in a creative writing supplement as part of my  application? Since the faculty, as opposed to the admissions officers,  will read my submission, will it be held to higher standards?
Typically,  college essays are, in fact, read by people who are part of the  admissions committee. Creative writing or arts  supplements, however, may be read by either faculty members or members of the  admissions committee. Who reads them depends on each school, and it might be best to  ask the school you are planning on applying to what their policy is. Supplements are held to  no higher standards than the application essay. Sending in a creative  supplement signals that you are, perhaps, also interested in joining a  particular group or club, or are enthusiastic about getting involved with the  artistic opportunities at a college.
That being  said, submit a creative application only if you truly think your  application will benefit from a sample of your creative work, and don't  just do it for the sake of sending in something else. Wasting an admissions officer's time by giving them things to read that don't add anything new to the picture is never a good idea. These supplements  are meant to show a side of you that you might not necessarily have been  able to show in your common app essays. So if you're serious about creative writing and you think you have some quality work to send (the shorter the better), go for it, but think twice about sending in work just for the sake of sending it in.
If I have a mental illness, how should I factor that in when deciding what schools to apply to? 
It is strongly recommended that you check to see what mental health resources are offered at the colleges to which you want to apply. Mental health resources can vary vastly from school to school, and it  would be advisable to research the colleges on your list if you're concerned,  just to know if you'll feel safe at the place or not. A good resource to  check out is the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
