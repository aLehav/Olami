After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MOSHI, Tanzania—The Swahili language has at least three proverbs on patience. “Pole pole ndio mwendo” means “slowly, slowly, indeed we go.” “Haraka, haraka haina baraka” means “hurry, hurry has no blessings.” And “Haba na haba kujaza kibaba” means “little, by little you fill the pot.” Patience is the currency of life here, where nothing goes as planned or works as designed.
I realized this during my third hour of waiting at the municipal office. I need the mayor’s permission to enter each public health center. I go to the end of the hall on the second floor, announce myself to the secretaries behind the glass, and take a seat in the row of velvet chairs in the hallway outside the office. I don’t sit in the first seat, because if I invest that much in getting seen quickly my will to wait will surely be broken. I take the third or fourth to last seat. Then the hallway turns into my library. The first time I went to the office, I finished J. M. Coetzee’s autobiography. The second time, I finished “Mountains Beyond Mountains.” The third time, I finished “A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.” I laugh at the funny parts and tear up at the sad ones, and my neighbors eye me nervously; I am not taking the government seriously enough.
Or maybe I realized it the tenth time that the power shut off mid-shower and the water went from warm to freezing. If you ask three people in Moshi why the electricity cannot stay on for 24 hours in any given district of the city, you get three different answers. The rainy season was light this year, so the dam isn’t full and the hydropower isn’t working. A man fell on the electrical lines, and it’s taking a long time to fix the flesh-wire mess. The government was working on a secret new power source, but corrupt officials stole all the money. Maybe all of this is true.
Meanwhile, I’ve developed coping techniques for the showers. Holding your breath staves off the cold quite well. You duck in and hold your breath for a few seconds, and then duck out when you have to breathe. The need for oxygen, it turns out, trumps the need for warmth. Alternately, I once read that there is a sect of Buddhist monks that stands in freezing rain to build character, so sometimes I think, “I can out-character that certain sect of Buddhist monks.” If none of these work, I remember that I can complain about it later, or better yet, spread my own ludicrous rumor about why the power is out. Can you believe the guards at the central station were watching a Manchester United vs. Barcelona game, and let a rogue impala canter in and wreck the transformers? Neither can I.
Or maybe I realized it today, on the minibus. There were sixteen people sitting in the thirteen seats and eight others standing against the doorway. “Shut the door!” a woman yelled at the bus conductor, which was a bit unfair, because the door was only open because half of the passengers were hanging out of the vehicle. As we ambled down the hill, we saw a large woman with an outstretched hand ahead. Everyone was hoping she would pass on the bus and take the next one, but she ignored the grumblings and snarls from kids in the back whose faces were already pressed up against the windshields and heaved herself inside. It was too much for me, “Acha!” (Stop!) I called, as usual, too weakly, so it took three Tanzanians yelling at the bus conductor that the poor foreign girl wanted to get off half a mile back, to stop the bus. I extracted each limb out of the ball of humans and walked the rest of the way back to the hostel.
Most hours of most days none of this really bothers me. I can feel my personality inching down the alphabet—I think I’m at a type C and sliding. I’m sure this will result in problems when I arrive in Cambridge in late August and think—I don’t have to register today, I’ll just email someone and say there was a fat woman on the bus this morning. Or, I can be ten minutes late to the editorial meeting, because everyone else will be twenty minutes late. Or, I can answer my emails tomorrow because this headache could turn into malaria. But type C personalities don’t care about that. Haraka, haraka haina baraka.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MUNICH, Germany—I never intended to spend the night at Munich’s main train station, a sprawling structure that flows into a neighborhood of food stands, youth hostels, sex shops, strip clubs, and casinos.
Rather, the intention was to be more spontaneous than usual—to get out of my comfort zone and go into Munich, without a meticulously detailed agenda in hand.
But on this star-crossed evening, every affordable option in Munich was booked, and shelling out exorbitant amounts of money didn’t factor into my romantic idea of spontaneity. So, I stiffened my lip, bought an espresso, and settled into the sleepless world of Hauptbahnhof München.
What follows is timetable of how I spent the next six hours:
11:30 - 11:40 p.m.—Store backpack in locker. Consider spending the night in a storage locker (only five euros!).
11:40 - 12:10 a.m.—Wander the Central Station vicinity. Pass by several strip clubs. Consider if I would ever consider getting a lap dance, if I were a guy who were the considering type. It begins to rain, heavily. Wander back into the Hauptbahnhof (Hbf).
12:10—Remember I was diagnosed earlier that evening with a very mild case of what the doctor told me was varicella.
12:20—Watch drunken German stag parties stumble into the station in lederhosen, singing. The station has interesting acoustics.
12:30—Spot a mesmerizing exhibition by World Press Photo of 2011’s award-winning photos. See pictures of a bull impaling a matador through the throat, earthquake victims in China and Haiti, oil spills all over the world, gang violence on a street corner in Brazil, the corpse of a young girl being tossed into a mass morgue, an old woman falling on a sidewalk, volcano eruption in Indonesia, and carcasses of cows signaling impending famine.
1:00—Chilled by the photo exhibition. Reminded of own mortality. Grapple with mortality.
1:50—Wander around the mostly closed shops in the Hbf. See advertisement for prepackaged iced coffee. Walk into store to buy iced coffee; drink. Feel disappointed.
2:20—Reminded that I have the chicken pox, or at least am supposed to be sick. Suddenly feel hungry and slightly cold.
3:00—Get instant chicken noodle soup from vending machine for half a Euro. The carrot pieces are orange, chewy, and fragrant.
3:15—Buy another cup of instant soup. Vegetable soup. Hot, and delicious.
4:30—Pick up backpack from storage locker. Sit on bench next to track.
5:35—Train arrives.
5:36 a.m.—Board train. Try to understand own mortality and inconsistency of the world. Think about having chicken pox and try to fall sleep.

Panera Bread, a national chain of bakery-cafés, will open a new location this fall at the former location of Bob Slate Stationer.
Offering sandwiches, soups, salads, and other bakery items, Panera will likely become a competitor to its former partner Au Bon Pain. The new location will be at 1288 Mass. Ave., located about two blocks away from Au Bon Pain.
“Putting a Panera Bread in Harvard Square is something special to us. We certainly want to have a café we will feel extremely proud of,” said Panera Bread joint venture area director Gregg T. Godfrey.
The store, which Godfrey said he hopes will open by November, will occupy space in both the first and second floors of the building, including the area above Qdoba. The first floor, at 3,000 square feet, will include the kitchen, service area, and 50 seats. The 2,200-square-foot upstairs area will have an additional 75 seats and a fireplace, as well as set of double windows for great viewing of the Square.
Despite being a national chain founded in Missouri, the company has close ties to the Harvard Square community, said Panera Bread joint venture area director Gregg T. Godfrey. Ronald M. Shaich, founder and executive chairman of Panera Bread, graduated from Harvard Business School in 1978 and currently lives in Brookline.
“In some ways, we consider Harvard Square his home,” Godfrey said.
Godfrey started looking for a location in Harvard Square in early 2008, citing the educated community and the heavy foot traffic of the area as primary reasons.
The search spread over nine sites in the Square, including the spot where the new Starbucks now resides. Godfrey said he chose the 1288 Mass Ave. location for its proximity to the campus and its spacious interior.
While Panera has a generalized layout for its stores, Godfrey said that the interior of this location will be adapted to have a Harvard Square feel.
“We have to make sure we do something special here,” said Godfrey, who invited Panera’s vice president of creative design Jay Jung to visit the future site.
The company is also considering testing out table service at the new Harvard Square location.
“It’s a way to continue to improve our customers’ experience in the store when dining in,” Godfrey said.
According to Godfrey, college students are always supporters of Panera due to the free Wi-Fi and the popular "You Pick Two" meal.
“You get real food in a nice experience and environment without spending a lot of money,” Godfrey said.
The company, which recently opened a new branch in Porter Square, aims to become a part of every community they operate in, Godfrey said. In Boston, the company donates money and time to the Children’s Hospital. Employees also volunteer and cook meals at local charities. All leftover products are donated to local charities every night.
Panera will also become a member of the Harvard Square Business Association, where the general manager will get involved.
Panera may be a chain, but Godfrey said he believes the new store will be well received, citing the success of other popular chains in the Square, such as Bertucci’s, Starbucks, Uno Chicago Grill, and Au Bon Pain.
“We don’t look at it as we’re this giant chain,” he said. “If we were, we probably wouldn’t have taken just about three years to find what would be the best place for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated July 23, 4:00 a.m. | At least 91 people died in Norway after a bomb blast in Oslo and a shooting spree at a summer camp left citizens of the Scandinavian nation in shock.
In Oslo, seven people died after a bomb shattered windows and damaged buildings used primarily by government employees, including Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, and Norwegian media organizations.
Later that afternoon at Utoya island, about 60 miles northwest of Oslo, a gunman killed at least 84 people at a summer camp organized by the country’s Labor Party. The gunman, a Norwegian who was later arrested, had been seen in Oslo before the explosion in that city, according to Norway’s acting national police chief.
No Harvard students are in Oslo on University-related research or programs, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said in an email.
Ursula Lindqvist, the director of undergraduate studies for Scandinavian, called the city where the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded “a very symbolic location to have this attack.”
“Nothing like this has ever happened in Oslo before,” Lindqvist said.
Initial speculation was that Islamic extremist groups were linked to the attacks, especially when two tried to take credit for them. Since then, Norwegian police said that a 32-year-old homegrown terrorist was responsible for both attacks. Media outlets there identified him as Anders Behring Breivik.
"I have message to those who attacked us," Stoltenberg said. "It's a message from all of Norway: You will not destroy our democracy and our commitment to a better world."
The attacks represented the worst violence the country had seen since World War II.
“Norwegians are a very insular society, but when you’re in Norway, it all feels like you’re in a magical wonderland,” Lindqvist said. “It feels like a place where nothing bad could ever happen.”
