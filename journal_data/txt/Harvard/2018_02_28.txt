After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an all too real dystopian world, “Red Clocks” by Leni Zumas explores four women’s lives when abortion, adoption by a single parent, and in vitro fertilization are illegal in the United States. The women are often referred to not by name, but rather by their relationship to men: the wife, the daughter, the mender, and the biographer. Interwoven among these present day accounts are excerpts from a biography about a woman whose scientific work is not properly recognized. These sections detract from the work as a whole because Zumas’ strongest work describes how women’s lives could be disrupted with laws that restrict women’s rights. Although the novel sends a powerful message, at moments Zumas makes style choices that ultimately detract from the novel.
The book begins in none other than “a room for women whose bodies are broken”: the waiting room for the gynecologist. The biographer is waiting to be artificially inseminated, again, in the hopes that she will be able to raise a child. This is her last hope, as a new law rules that she cannot adopt a child without a partner. The biographer also deals with challenges many single women face today. A therapist once asked if the biographer was “claiming not to need a romantic relationship in order to shield [herself] from disappointment and rejection?” Zumas perfectly displays the despair the biographer feels at not being able to conceive, while also showcasing the questions single women must constantly answer. These are not “what if”’s but rather real life examples.
“Red Clocks” seems to take a strong stance on abortion, but of course it would be nearly impossible to write a novel with this premise and remain unbiased. The daughter, only fifteen years old, is pregnant and is willing to do anything to not be. She herself was adopted and doesn’t want her baby to wonder why they were given up, but she also realizes raising a child will drastically change her life. The daughter tells the biographer, “I just want it out of my body. I want to stop being infiltrated.” It is here that Zumas does an excellent job of showing both sides of the spectrum: those who want nothing more than a child they can’t have and those who are not ready for such a big commitment.
The other two main characters, the wife and the mender, further explore the many roles that women have in the world. The mender uses herbs to heal and mend, as well as terminate pregnancies. She is put on trial for just that, but furthermore is criticized by the community for being a woman who lives a solitary life. The wife has a husband and two children, but is just as unhappy as the other women. In a marriage with no problem except for a lack of love, Zumas provides an illuminating example of an unhappy woman with a seemingly perfect life. Within these four stories, Zumas shows the many dimensions of women in society.
Unfortunately, Zumas attempts to do one thing too many with the excerpts from the biographer’s novel-in-progress. While short in length, a new excerpt follows each chapter. They often break the flow of the story but add nothing to the overall narrative. The biographer often summarizes her novel, so no new information is provided within the excerpts.
In a world not so different from today’s, Zumas paints a picture that includes women living a less fulfilling life. In framing a dystopia that is caused not by some catastrophic event but rather the passing of a law, the suffering of the characters feels more real and more terrifying. “Red Clocks” is a story that has the power to make its reader enraged, despondent, and scared.

If you’re hoping for a revolutionary and original Broadway production, don’t waste your money on “Waitress.” While Tony-winning director Diane Paulus leads an entertaining show, “Waitress” is not incredibly impressive and falls short of the expectations popular buzz has given it.
Playing at the Boston Opera House until March 4, “Waitress” centers on Jenna (Desi Oakley), a Southern waitress and pie chef extraordinaire who lives in the American South and unexpectedly becomes pregnant. To escape her abusive husband Earl (Nick Bailey) and provide a better life for her child, she enters a pie-making contest. Along the way, she builds relationships with the customers and employees of Joe’s Dinner. Though the play is comedic and a technical marvel, it fails to create any real depth, leaving the audience laughing but emotionally unfulfilled.
The production takes full advantage of the unique features of the Boston Opera House during set transition, elevating the show’s technical aspects. Not only are these transitions smooth, but they also contribute to the storytelling as they change in accordance to the emotional shifts in the play. Rather than minimizing conspicuousness, the movement of set pieces and backdrops draws the audience into the story. Lighting and costuming are equally a delight. The combination of the  two aspects creates a vibrant production that conveys the joviality and sparky personalities of Jenna and her friends at Joe’s Diner.
Though Grammy-nominated singer Sara Bareilles pens the lyrics, the music is neither unprecedented nor extraordinary. With the exception of the song “She Used to Be Mine,” Sara Bareilles’ work is formulaic, relying on the style and sound of traditional musical theater with a mix of pop in the upper registry. Lorin Latarro’s choreography is far more exciting. Though it seems gimmicky early on, filled with unnecessary synchronised movement that detracts from the music, it eventually contributes to the power of scenes like the birth of Jenna’s child. Working in conjunction with superb set transitions, movement captures emotional dynamics that the acting fails to portray.
The overall production is light and humorous, but it loses its emotional gravity in its comedy. The love story between the two eccentric young nerds, Dawn (Lenne Klingaman) and Ogie (Jeremy Morse), along with Nurse Norma’s (Maiesha McQueen) perfectly timed snarky commentary, incites lots of laughter. Yet “Waitress” also has a more serious side, to which the acting fails to do justice. Oakley’s Jenna is static and passive. Experiences evoke emotion because of the inherent tragedy of the situation rather than the emotional empathy the audience should feel towards her character. Oakley’s inability to portray any emotion other than shallow optimism prevents the audience from truly understanding her world. Though she has friends and support, her life is full of domestic trauma, deceit, and desperation, none of which are fully explored.
Other characters also lack emotional depth. The cast generally struggles to deliver serious moments and compensates by leaning heavily on their characters’ comedic sides. The one notable exception is Bailey’s Earl. Because his character is steeped in darkness, Bailey delivers a a gripping performance and delves into the multi-faceted mind of Jenna’s abuser, which helps audiences understand why Jenna feels bound to him. Baily’s acting highlights Earl’s anger, manipulation, and eventual vulnerability in such a way that he delivers the most authentic performance of the entire show.
Acting issues ultimately stem from deficiencies in the writing and plot issues. In the earlier parts, “Waitress” raises a lot of serious questions: When do we leave those who need us? Can extramarital affairs ever be moral? What responsibilities do we owe to others and what do we owe to ourselves? The most popular song, “She Used to Be Mine,” a ballad which focuses on Jenna’s view of herself, effectively encapsulates these musings. Besides this song, “Waitress” isn’t fulfilling. Characters react indifferently instead of making changes. Their arcs stretch over hours, only to be hastily resolved at the end. This problem affects even the main character—the birth of her baby, her relationship with Earl, and her affair run through half of their arc in the final 10 minutes of the production, such that the major questions are only half-heartedly answered.
In the end, “Waitress” is your average feel-good Broadway play. For what it does set out to accomplish, it accomplishes well, managing to marvel with its technical aspects and its comedic wit. It is a musical that is heart-warming for the whole family. Yet it is unquestionably surface-level and therefore a superfluous addition to the Broadway collection.

The Harvard South Asian Association celebrated 30 Years of Ghungroo this February. Ghungroo is the largest cultural show on campus, made up of 300 students producing, directing, and performing.

Dancers move about and talk over their coming performance in the green room as the show is just starting

A traditional dance featuring Ghungroos, which are strings of bells strapped around dancer's ankles, which give off an array of metallic rings with each stomp of the foot. These dance accessories are the namesake of the Ghungroo show.

The performances of dance and music were split up by a variety of skits, recreating the process of conception of Ghungroo 30 years ago with plenty of room for jokes. 
People mill about in the stairwell outside of Aggasiz theater, where Ghungroo was held


A singer belts out a song to a receptive crowd, backed up by guitar (not pictured) and traditional Indian tabla drums 

Dancers stand and lie in wait for their time to come to go on stage.

Dancers rush off stage, with a rose thrown from the crowd lying on the stage. The crowd was very lively and supportive through the show, and many flowers found their way onto the stage through the course of the performance.


Three of the founders of the original Ghungroo show joined the show's director's on stage and expressed awe at how far the production has progressed in the thirty years.


The SAA presidents and show producers, Simi Shah '19 and Ayman Mohammad '19, rush out amidst much fanfare from the show's cast as well as the audience.

Tomi J. Adeyemi ’15 is a Nigerian American YA fantasy author living in San Diego, California. Her first book, “Children of Blood and Bone” comes out March 6. On March 13, Adeyemi will speak in Brookline, Massachusetts at Brookline Booksmith about her debut novel. The Harvard Crimson sat down with her to discuss how her novel tackles real-world racial issues within the context of fantasy.
The Harvard Crimson: Let’s get the most important question out of the way. Thoughts on “Black Panther?”
Tomi J. Adeyemi: Oh, amazing. I’ve seen it twice. I love it so much. It’s funny, I think I loved it even more the second time, because there’s just so much in it. It was like watching the same movie but from a different perspective. I wanted to see it again, but I’m trying to write a sequel [for “Children of Blood and Bone”] right now. I loved it, though. I’m just so happy. Months ago, I said, “‘Black Panther’’s going to come out, and it’s going to be a smash, and I think it’s going to blow open the door for diversity in Hollywood”—but this is way better than anything I could imagine.
THC: Moving on to your book, will you talk a little about what “Children of Blood and Bone” is about? What is its purpose in the world?
TJA: Honestly, it’s funny that you started with “Black Panther,” because the book is just “Black Panther” with magic. Without ruining the movie, it has a take on the real world and the real-world issues that affect black people, and that’s what my book is about. It’s this epic fantasy that puts black people at the forefront. On the one hand, it’s for kids like me—and kids who look like me, and even kids who don’t look like me but also aren’t white—to see that wow, we can do this. We can ride giant lions and fight the bad guy and have these great adventures. And after seeing John Boyega as a black stormtrooper, or diversity in general in “Pacific Rim”—it’s not to say that we had nothing, but we’ve never had anything like this, anything that took us seriously. We never had anything that said, “You are the star. You are Harry Potter. You are Katniss Everdeen.”
So that’s one of my book’s purposes. But as for its other purpose: It’s an allegory for the modern black experience, for people who aren’t black to understand what it’s like to walk in our shoes. I personally believe that books are the closest you can ever get to being inside someone else’s head. So that is what the book is for—to show that, and to make it very clear. Every obstacle in the book is tied to a real obstacle that black people face now, or have faced as recently as a few years ago.
THC: That’s such a huge, political mission! Can you talk about why you chose fantasy to express your message?
TJA: Fantasy is my first love, as it is with a lot of people. There’s a reason we freak out in a special way about “Black Panther,” or “Game of Thrones,” or “Harry Potter”—because we love fantasy! We love magic. We love seeing these big, epic battles. I’ve always loved reading them. That is what I love to spend time with, and what I love to write. As for the underlying purpose of the book, I think that with fantasy, you get to take a step back [from the real world]. It’s an incredible tool for putting out a message like this, because it’s creating a distance that forces people to see inside situations as opposed to being warped by prejudices and racism.
THC: Do you have any other favorite books that do this same job?
TJA: Read “An Ember in the Ashes,” by Sabaa Tahir. I read that book and immediately thought, “I have to write.” Once, when I was talking to a librarian at a book event, she said, “This is going to sound really stupid, but I didn’t realize how truly terrifying slavery was until I read this book.”
THC: What’s next for you?
TJA: I’m working on a sequel. The YA world is kind of on a book-a-year schedule. It’s hectic, but I’m excited with where I’ve been this past year and with where I’m going!

“It is energizing to see the impact that the arts are making throughout the United States,” NEA Chairman Jane Chu said in the press release. “These NEA-supported projects are good examples of how the arts build stronger and more vibrant communities, improve well-being, prepare our children to succeed, and increase the quality of our lives.”On Feb. 7, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) announced that they were giving $1,097,500 in grants to 41 Massachusetts-based nonprofit arts organizations. This is part of the NEA’s annual tradition of distributing grant money to support arts programs across the United States. In its first of two rounds of grant distributions, the NEA is allocating over $25 million for more than 4,500 communities across all 50 states.
Massachusetts’ seven-figure grant is the fifth highest in the nation after New York, California, Illinois, and Texas. When asked if the sum was surprising, Steve S. Slowinski, the National Inclusion Manager of Partners for Youth with Disabilities (PYD), one of the nonprofits benefiting from the NEA grants, replied that it wasn’t.
“Especially here in the Boston area, there is a huge number of really strong arts programming,” Slowinski said. “Just the sheer amount of organizations that are doing such great work in the field. It’s always been impressive seeing them and all the opportunities out there.”
PYD plans on using their $25,000 grant for their summer theater camp, Access to Theatre, which is open to those with or without disabilities. The program involves acting, set design, and directing, all of which culminate in an original show.
“The reason why we do theater arts programming is because they have the capacity to really unlock talent and skills that many don’t realize they have,” Slowinski said. “In my experience, I’ve seen many youth just blossom and come out of their shells, and become more independent and vocal and confident, and are self-advocates for themselves as a result of this theater training,” he later added.
Other organizations receiving grants include nationally-recognized names, like the Institute of Contemporary Art, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Boston Ballet. Educational institutions, such as the Berklee College of Music and Boston University, are included in the list of 41 grantees as well.
But small- and middle-sized nonprofits organizations also frequent the list, like Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción, a South End-based nonprofit that holds arts education workshops for children and runs La Galería, a year-round art gallery featuring work from artists from the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Their arts programs director, Elsa Mosquera Sterenberg, said it was important to talk about funding smaller organizations.
“There is a lot of artistic activity happening in smaller middle-sized organizations, especially in community-based organizations,” Mosquera Sterenberg said. “We’re touching people everyday directly and changing their lives.”
This year, IBA plans on using their grant money to fund concerts and to focus on the effects of Hurricane Maria. “We are celebrating our Puerto Rican roots [and helping] our artists that were really touched and affected by the Hurricane Maria,” she said. IBA will also be putting on "La Cucarachita Martina," a theatrical retelling of a Puerto Rican children’s tale.
Amid the hopeful plans, the NEA’s grant news comes in light of the Trump administration’s budget proposal for 2019, which was revealed just five days after the NEA’s own announcement. The budget proposal plans to reduce the NEA’s budget by $121 million, leaving them with $29 million—just $4 million shy from the grant money they doled out earlier in February.
“We are disappointed because we see our funding actively making a difference with individuals in thousands of communities and in every Congressional District in the nation,” Chu said in a statement. Mosquera Sterenberg shares a similar sentiment.
“Can you imagine?” Mosquera Sterenberg said. “That is absolutely absurd.”

UPDATED: March 5, 2018 at 3:08 p.m.
Naked Giants’ website features the following quote from drummer Henry LaVallee: “I just want to make as much noise and have as much fun and get as sweaty as I can.” A cursory listen to their new single, “Everybody Thinks They Know (But No One Really Knows),” might suggest that the band’s music is the embodiment of LaVallee’s mission statement. The track’s fast tempo, seemingly-untrained singing, distorted guitar, and excitingly sloppy drum fills are hallmarks of a DIY punk aesthetic that is often further characterized by the noise, the fun, and the sweat. But look any closer and “Everybody Thinks They Know” is trying for more than just fun. Naked Giants are trying too many things at once in their path to stardom, and they’re failing at too many for “Everybody Thinks They Know” to be a total success.
To make a more current comparison, the chorus’s inclusion of the ubiquitous “millennial whoop” evokes any number of late-2000s/early-2010s indie pop choruses. Furthermore, the production of the song is too polished to deny that Naked Giants have grander career aspirations than sweaty fun. The instruments, especially the drums, are recorded and mixed in a glossier way than one tends to hear in indie punk music, and the dissonant, arrhythmic guitar and bass chords that start the recording sound more planned than the mid-show tuning they are meant to evoke.
Is this aesthetic diversity a good thing? In the opinion of this reviewer, it is not.  “Everybody Thinks They Know (But No One Really Knows)” is hamstrung by its ambition to be both a punk head-banger and a radio-friendly indie anthem. And in the end, it achieves neither goal, too intentional for punk and too melodically Spartan for indie pop. The name Naked Giants provides a likely unintended but nonetheless useful shorthand for this stylistic dilemma. Will the band be Naked—raw, sweat-and-noise-loving punk rockers, as suggested by Henry LaVallee—or Giants—polished and commercially-oriented indie stars? Time will tell, but for now, here’s to hoping they stop trying to be both at once. As the “Bible says, no one can serve two masters.”

British trio Kero Kero Bonito have carved out a niche in what I call “adult children’s music,” distinguished by Sarah Midori Perry’s sing-song delivery of childlike—yet thoughtful—lyrics over eminently danceable pop grooves. The group’s new single, “Only Acting,” bears the aforementioned hallmarks of their earlier work: Perry’s signature chirp is front and center, and the drums are as danceable as ever. But it has an experimental edge lacking in previous KKB material. Even with such radical experimentation, Kero Kero Bonito are able to turn “Only Acting” into a masterfully executed song.
That experimentation is most noticeable in the last 50 seconds of the single, which simulate a series of digital glitches.  A split-second of the song repeats like a skipping CD, followed another fragment that eerily plays slowly, so muddy that individual instruments and notes are impossible to make out. And finally, a portion of the song plays backwards, obscured by white noise. These 50 seconds are more interesting on paper than they are enjoyable on speakers, but the first three minutes of the track are so infectiously fun that the deconstructive denouement feels more than earned.
The song’s outro is the most obvious place to hear unusual sonic choices in “Only Acting,” but its experimentalism is not confined to its final minute. The brief moments of atonality during the first verse and the full-on noise interlude that follows the first chorus would be just as jarring as the outro if not for Perry’s voice, and the drums remain recognizable through each, like Sherpa guides through a blizzard. The abrupt stylistic switch that occurs as the first chorus begins—from chilled-out pop to maximalist, Foo-Fighters-esque rock—is equally notable for its experimental fearlessness. If not for the even more unusual choices made in this song, the focus would be on that transition alone.
A lesser band’s track might crumble under the weight of all this experimentation, but Kero Kero Bonito keep “Only Acting” captivating and pleasant. They pull it off because they remember the core elements of good pop music—a memorable melody, a strong beat, and a compelling vocal performance—and give those elements prominence, even when the going gets wildly experimental.

Earlier this month, Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira announced a new administrative effort to reduce wait times for Counseling and Mental Health Services appointments. The effort, in response to a steady increase in the number of requested appointments at CAMHS, seeks to respond to all students who request appointments less than 48 hours after they contact CAMHS.
While we commend CAMHS for moving to decrease wait times and get students the care they need, we reiterate that mental health issues on campus cannot simply be solved by one approach or by one organization. In order to seriously address issues of mental health on campus, cooperation from the administration will be needed. Only then can concrete actions, such as increasing funding to address mental health issues and ameliorating these issues’ underlying causes, be taken.
In the meantime, we call on CAMHS to continue to explain to students the availability and breadth services it provides. Even as wait times decrease, same-day urgent care services that provide vital immediate support remain a vital source of support. Students often require these services to remain as safe and healthy as possible during their time at Harvard.
Nevertheless, we are glad to see that UHS is taking the issue of student mental health seriously, and we hope this effort sparks more discussion concerning how to correctly and effectively improve mental health on campus. The willingness of UHS to recognize that an increase in the volume of students seeking mental health care demands a corresponding increase in CAMHS’s capacity to treat them shows not only theoretical willingness to acknowledge the importance of mental health, but actual willingness to devote time, energy, and funds to making its system more responsive.
Still, while UHS and CAMHS are worthy of praise, they alone cannot be expected to bear the entire weight of issues of mental health on campus. Though their treatment efforts are critical, some of the most prominent root causes of the surge in demand for mental health services come from outside the purview of UHS. Indeed, Harvard’s stressful culture itself is one of the most important and widespread of these causes. Thus, if mental health is truly going to improve, the administration must work to foster a less stressful atmosphere around academic life at the College.
Given the existence of efforts like the Transcript Project, which asks students to “Discard the conventional markers of academic success,” it seems clear that the administration does desire to change the competitive, high-stress culture surrounding academic performance. However, this attempt to lower stress levels by telling students to focus less on their grades is hopelessly lacking in depth. A culture of driven, ambitious students will not relax itself into a more balanced atmosphere simply because its successful supervisors tell it that constant, unfailing perfection is not required for long-term success.
Simply put, the question of how to form a culture that deals with academic pressure more healthily is not an easy one, and there may be no perfect answers. But if the College is serious about making a difference, it must at least investigate ways of addressing the root causes of mental health.

“We have taken the route of communicating our concerns in a transparent fashion…. The result is a model for town-gown relations. We know it is far from perfect. But we are working together and determined to make it successful,” Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone and then-Tufts University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in a 2009 Letter to the Editor in the Somerville Times, describing the relationship between Tufts and Somerville.
When he led Tufts, Bacow spoke frequently about the importance of strong community relationships. In 2004, he negotiated a plan to formalize the payment of community benefits to Somerville and Medford, where Tufts is located, including it in a September update to the university. After a conversation with Somerville Alderman Jack Connolly, he inaugurated a tradition of “Community Days,” bringing Tufts affiliates and Somerville and Medford residents together. Now over 15 years old, the annual event combines student performances with presentations from community-based agencies and city departments.
In a letter presenting a 2006 report entitled “Connecting with Neighbors: Tufts and the Somerville Community,” Bacow traced the success of Tufts’ relationship with Somerville to “the promise of mutual respect and a desire to share our cultures and resources.”
This respect does seem to have been mutual. During a flare-up of town-gown tensions in 2007 after the rowdiness and “rude behavior of some Tufts students,” Curtatone penned a letter to the editor of the Somerville Times urging calm. He cited his strong working relationship with Bacow and lauded several of Tufts’ community outreach programs, and made particular note of their 2004 agreement, which he stated would “net the City of Somerville more than $1.2 million over a ten-year period” in “direct in-lieu-of-tax contributions.”
Direct payments like these are part of a broad trend of payment-in-lieu-of-tax, or PILOT, agreements between tax-exempt institutions and the communities that host them. Legally, these payments are voluntary, but they often fill critical holes in municipal budgets in cities where a high concentration of tax-exempt land on hospital, university, and museum campuses shrinks the commercial tax base and strains public funds. Some cities, including Cambridge and Somerville, set payment plans through individual negotiations with universities. The City of Boston independently calculates an expected contribution based on estimates of the value of a university’s property and of the cost of city services that they are likely to consume and requests that each institution pay the calculated amount. But even after counting programs with community benefits toward the sum, many institutions fall far short.
While the $120,000 per year in the Bacow-Curtatone agreement is nothing to sneeze at, it is pocket change for either a university or a city, and less than either of the two men involved in the deal drew in salary in the waning years of the ten-year agreement. As the Tufts Daily noted in 2016, Boston had received more from Tufts in 2011, 2012, and 2013 under their formula-based payment system than Somerville had under the Bacow-Curtatone agreement. A new negotiated agreement between Tufts and Somerville pays more to the city at $275,000 per year, but still falls short of the $556,000 that they paid in 2016 under the PILOT agreement with Boston. A payment at this level is laudable if the alternative is nothing, but laughably small as a substitute for the property tax payments that form the backbone of local budgets.
Harvard is not fulfilling its financial obligations under either the negotiated settlement or the formula system. In Boston, Harvard has been delinquent for each year of the six-year formula program, and only paid 53 percent of its 2017 obligation, or less than 7 percent of what it would pay if its property were taxable. In Cambridge, payments are set under a 20-year negotiated agreement that has been unpopular with Cantabrigians since it was signed in 2005. At the time, then-City Council University Relations Committee co-chair Marjorie Decker called it “just a pittance.”
Bacow improved the relationship between Tufts and Somerville in many ways. Under his leadership, Tufts may have been the “almost perfect neighbor” that Curtatone describes. But payments in lieu of taxes are one way in which universities in greater Boston could be a lot more perfect, and Harvard is a lead offender.
The new administration will have a lot on its plate when Bacow, now the president-elect of Harvard, takes office on July 1. But if he hopes to realize his neighborly ambitions from his time at Tufts, he owes it to Cambridge to renegotiate a fairer PILOT agreement, and he owes it to Boston to meet Harvard’s full payment obligations under the contribution formula, which calculates payments as a percentage of the standard property tax based on the share of city budgets that fund services that universities are likely to consume.
Bacow’s new administration has an opportunity to set an example of a true “model for town-gown relations”: to abandon a broken PILOT paradigm that lets universities off the hook for the financial burden that they place on their host communities—the cost of keeping the roads around them plowed and maintained, the water that flows through their pipes clean, and the neighborhood around them safe—and to set higher payments that fully compensate them for it.

I can’t breathe.
I’m lying on the floor of my single in Leverett. In the dark, I face the ceiling, and I wonder if God is actually beyond it. I feel so alone.
I need to tell my friend about my same-sex attractions, but I can’t find my strength. Beads of sweat slick my hand. I wipe my hands on my jeans so I can pick up my phone. I mouth a quick, desperate prayer. I dial.
“Hello?”
The student I called that day became one of my closest friends as we grew as Christians within the community known as Harvard College Faith and Action. Throughout college, we had many more conversations about sexuality and scripture and the like, but I can’t forget that first conversation.
I didn’t think he would yell at me or curse me, though the Church has historically failed to love our BGLTQ brothers and sisters in ways much, much worse than these. I thought there might be a more subtle rejection, the kind that is revealed in a softening of the voice or an uncomfortable shifting and the soft “Oh.” I was hurting, I was terrified, and, knowing the history of the Church towards BGLTQ people, I expected the worst.
What I didn’t expect was the response that pierced through the silence: “I love you, and I want to walk beside you.”
His response unlocked for me the profound beauty of God’s love. This love is, to us, miraculous. That a holy God enters the world to dwell with unholy people is utterly unexpected, a divine subversion of dire circumstance.
I didn’t expect my friend to want to walk alongside me, and I could never have imagined the seemingly boundless humility with which he and others in HCFA sought to help me along in my struggle to reconcile my sexuality with my traditional faith over the next couple of years. To have same-sex attractions in a traditional, evangelical Christian context can be profoundly isolating, but one of the great surprises of my experience with HCFA was that so many of my friends were willing to lay down their busy Harvard lives to help me fight my loneliness. They called frequently to check in. They invited me to dinner every week. They asked me hang out on nights when I most likely would’ve spent unproductive hours in despair struggling to reconcile the requirements of my conscience with the realities of my desires.
Though I ultimately chose for theological reasons to become celibate, explorations of faith and sexuality in the fellowship have always been characterized, for me, by rigorous intellectual engagement, radical hospitality, and, above all, love that shatters expectations.
We all have different definitions of love. Our ideas of it are shaped by the media, our experiences, and most of all, by our relationships. Many people, including myself, have believed in foolish pride that we can distinguish love from hate with a single, swift glance from the outside. This is the error of every prejudice. The Editorial Board of The Crimson recently asserted, from the outside of HCFA, that a recent decision to remove a student from leadership based on what HCFA leaders termed a theological disagreement constitutes a “morally egregious” act of hatred, but as an op-ed by an alumna points out, ethical conversations within Christian faith communities are not always so simple.
On the contrary, a more in-depth profile of HCFA by the Fifteen Minutes magazine of The Crimson a year and a half ago led a reporter to the conclusion that “HCFA provides just the sort of emotional and personal guidance that many bemoan is not present enough at Harvard.” I only cite these examples to illustrate this: The truest knowledge of our neighbors comes from making the effort to share in their experiences of life. To love is to enter into a world beyond your own in order to understand the people therein and walk with them.
This love is the love I have known within HCFA, and it is the love embodied by the God who enters into our world to know us and to love us. We may fail to extend this love to our BGLTQ neighbors from time to time. For that, we humbly ask forgiveness. We are doubly convicted as followers of the God who we believe perfectly embodies love grounded in empathy.
Even so, the failure of the Church to attain the perfect love of God should not destroy our faith in its goodness. The love that enters into a world unlike its own and empathizes, reconciles, and heals is sorely needed right now. Our prejudices are shattered when we step past principles to discover people in need of our love and our presence. Can we be brave enough to reach out to our queer friends and vice versa? Will we open up the difficult conversations and the long days of walking with one another that will lead to understanding? If so, perhaps we can find a love that is beyond our expectations.
I have hope that in this challenging work, we all might find the unexpected miracle of a gentle “I love you” in the silence, a breath of life giving us power to dive deeper into relationship with each other, and ultimately, with our God.

“I’ve always been a huge notebook guy and just wrote down thoughts whenever they came to me,” Ian H. McClanan ’20 explains as he leans forward in his recliner, a scattered arc of notebooks before him. “And then I came up with the idea of all ideas, which is make a video channel where I literally talk about ideas.”
This is how he starts, with notebooks and ideas. Then he goes into his process, his philosophy, and the rest of his life, and there is so much he says at every moment that it becomes easy to understand why he writes everything down. Yet when he talks, you get the sense he cares about the things he says.
Which helps explain why McClanan hosts a YouTube and Facebook video channel, Ideas and Ian. His topic of choice is, as you might guess, ideas, and the ideas he covers range from authenticity to virtual reality to water bottle flipping. Each video begins with McClanan in his bed, staring excitedly into the camera. His wire rimmed glasses and surfer hair are recognizable enough, but what makes him memorable is the unbridled, effervescent energy that follows in the wake of his takeoff. The pajamas also help.
McClanan grew up in Portland, Ore., where he says he was something of a miniature version of his current frenetic self. “I've just always found it fun to be over the top and go over the top with different stuff,” he says. Once, in elementary school, he was assigned a project: Make an eight-inch high totem pole. McClanan’s totem pole was five feet tall and paper-mache, which tells you a lot about how he approaches things.
For McClanan, video making is an exercise in chaos control. His pre-production process always begins the same way—with hype. “I’m playing this loud music and I’m dancing around in my room, I’m getting hyped, I’m like ‘come on, here we go! Here we go!’” he says. “And then I get hyped and I walk in there with my PJs on—I do all my videos in my PJs—and I just say all this stuff really energetically and I mess up so much!”
He says that his videos, few of which are longer than three minutes, usually take around an hour to film. And although he starts off with a script, the ideas quickly take over, and by the end of the process, he “just sort of say[s] the whole thing.”
But where do the ideas come from? McClanan, brandishing one of his custom-patterned notebooks (available for $15 on his website), says he writes down notes from his everyday life—from dining hall conversations to classes.

“These videos are the product of me reflecting on some of these conversations to see how I actually feel about it,” he says. “Because if I don’t, usually those conversations just slip and go away. But to write them down is a great process of rethinking and actually coming to a consistent personal philosophy.”
McClanan isn’t the first Harvard student to have ideas—that list is rather long, and includes people like Jared C. Kushner ’03, Albert A. Gore ’69, and William S. Burroughs ’36. But McClanan’s awareness that everyday interactions are ephemeral is not something you hear very often.
His most valuable possession, consequently, is the stack of notebooks he keeps in a corner of his room. He flips through one of them, revealing pages pockmarked with pen scribbles and random notes. There are jottings  from Peru last summer, and then, a few flips later, a song. The notebooks are, in some way, a crystallization of the Ian McClanan Way of Life, or the philosophy that we should actively record our experiences and share them.
“The notebooks of my past are some of my most valuable possessions, and that's because they totally capture the types of things I was thinking at different times in my life,” he says. “If this place were burning down, these are some of the first ones I’d grab. There's nothing that has more character than one of these notebooks.”
Some of McClanan’s ideas seem like they already exist, like the campfire songbook. When I tell him this, he clarifies that his songbook would be “smaller and more indestructible.” He gestures towards one of the notebooks before him, which reminds me this is a recurring theme.
Others form a fresh take on new trends. McClanan has taken the idea of mobile tiny homes and AirBnB to their natural conclusion: a “tiny home moving hotel.” “I really love the idea of having a sick tiny home that's mobile so then I could be sort of semi-nomadic about where I’m living,” McClanan says, describing something akin to the already invented RV. “I think that'd be sick!”
McClanan has so many ideas, in fact, that when I ask him how he would escape Antarctica with only a silent harmonica and a non-circular clock, two of the many ideas he lists on his website, it takes him a few moments to remember what I’m talking about. Then, he bursts out into laughter.
“Damn. I don't really know. Maybe I would trace back the time and close my eyes and forget where I was,” he says. “Let’s go back to that one.”
But after this brief break, the conversation picks up again, as things always seem to do around McClanan. We never end up getting back to it.

In 1910, Harvard University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell decided there would be no flying on Sundays. That is, no airplane flying. Lowell’s decision meant that three extra days of dropping eggs out of aeroplanes had to be added to the academic calendar.
The year was 1909 and “flying machines” were the new interest of the elite, though most people in the world had never seen such a contraption.
Only six years after the Wright brothers’ first flight, Harvard affiliates created a club dedicated to aeroplanes. On Nov. 11, 1909, the Harvard Aeronautical Society was born, founded by a group of Harvard undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. According to local newspaper reports, about 300 students went to the first meeting, 250 of whom joined immediately. Within three months, the club had grown to 360 members and established an area in Gund Hall devoted to aviation, complete with a glider, models, and plans to build an aeroplane. Harvard had caught the aviation bug.

The club began with educational aims  “to promote the advance of aerial navigation” and to teach students about the burgeoning field of aeronautics. While part of the club was devoted to a lecture series on aeronautics, the club also built its very own aeroplane—the Harvard I—which made its first flight on June 1910. Led by Professor Abbott Lawrence Rotch, also the founder and director of the Blue Hill Observatory, the club became part of the Aero Club of North America by March 1910. This association allowed Harvard flyers to compete in domestic and international competitions.
Meanwhile, the Harvard club was planning a competition of its own which would dazzle the nation. The Harvard-Boston Aviation Meet, which took place Sept. 3rd to 13th 1910, was “the first meet of this kind of any consequence to be held in America up to the present time,” according to Scientific American. With the support of President Lowell and Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald, the event was expected to attract about 500,000 spectators to the field, along with countless more who would come to watch planes fly around the Boston area. Attracted by the promise of $50,000 in prize money, some of the best flyers in the world—including Wilbur Wright, Glenn Curtiss, and Claude Grahame-White—shipped their planes to Boston. The society’s activities were closely followed by the press, including The Crimson, which recorded club meetings and updates.
The 1910 meet was originally planned for Soldiers Field, where Harvard’s athletic fields are now located. However, due to space constraints, the meet moved to modern day Quincy, Massachusetts. This airshow was so alluring that President William Howard Taft and Massachusetts Governor Eben Sumner Draper decided to attend. Events included challenges in speed, altitude, duration, accuracy, as well as “dropping bombs on battleships.” While the bombs were made of plaster and the ships only outlines in a field, the meet helped demonstrate the potential military uses of airplanes. Two world records, ten days, and thousands of dollars of prize money later, Harvard’s first aeronautical meet was a huge success.
In the years following, flying became “sport.” Collegiate teams from across the northeast would compete in events including speed, accuracy, and bomb dropping. In 1911, the Harvard Aeronautics Society  hosted the first glider race.  The Harvard-Boston Aviation meet also continued. In 1911, the meet added a new event which required pilots to race to different locations in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.
Tragedy struck in 1912 when a pilot and passenger died in an accident during the aviation meet, abruptly ending the tradition of large Boston aviation competitions.
While the original society seems to have fallen apart after 1912, the Harvard Aeronautics Club came back to life in 1915 and taught students how to fly. In 1925, the Harvard Flying Club emerged and became extremely popular.  It appears that, over time, this group took over the role of the original Aeronautics Society, competing in intercollegiate meets and teaching students how to fly planes. Harvard did well on the intercollegiate circuit, competing against schools including Yale, NYU, Dartmouth, Ohio State, and Michigan.
Another flying society began in 1950, which included racing and allowed students to fly private planes around the country. According to reports at the time, the group earned a “playboy” reputation. A Crimson article at the time detailed “Aviation Club Mixes Flying And Partying,” mentioned how “HFC provides housing for pilots and their dates at the Falmouth Playhouse.”
Yet another iteration of the society appeared in 1983. In 1985, the Flying Club celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Harvard-Boston Aviation Meet with tours, lectures, and movies.
The club was briefly revived in 2007, but does not survive today. While it seems that Harvard’s days of dominating the skies are over for now, only time will tell if the college’s long-held aviation bug will take to the skies in years to come.

It was the summer of 1974 when the letter arrived. Imani Kazana was informed her services as Director of Harvard’s Afro-American Cultural Center—services that included building maintenance, filing paperwork, and on one occasion, birth coaching—were no longer necessary. She wasn’t surprised.
Kazana, who was in her second year as director, says she knew the cultural center was fighting an “uphill battle.” She says the University helped students scrape together about $100,000 when the center was first founded, but didn’t help raise money as time went on. Soon, the center’s funds dwindled.
“We did start trying to solicit donations and that kind of thing, but it wasn't anything close to what we needed,” she says. “Nothing close.”
Two years prior, Kazana’s personal life had seen a whirlwind of changes. She took the helm of the cultural center that year and also changed her name.
“When you're looking at the Harvard archives, you're probably going to find my first name—my previous names will come up first, so I better tell you what they were,” Kazana cautions. “Don't put it in the article. I don't want people to go backwards, I want to move forwards.”
Kazana’s outlook is future-focused. But in many ways, her last name—which means “united effort and strong force” in Swahili—informs the past as much as it does the future. It would soon become an apt descriptor of her work with the cultural center, of campus activism before her time, and of the ongoing struggle decades after her departure.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, as the landscape of affinity groups on campus evolved, a consistent theme has been the struggle for space—space to gather, space to make minority voices heard, and space in the University consciousness as a whole. Activist initiatives focused on the establishment of an academic department, a research institute and a cultural center. The last of these is yet to be established on Harvard’s campus, and an Undergraduate Council coalition is currently seeking to create a space for minority students.
Kazana was one player in the fight for this space—a fight that has stretched over decades and across different student groups; a fight that continues today.
Before there was a cultural center, there was the student group that pushed for it.
In those days, the Harvard-Radcliffe Association for African and Afro-American Students—AFRO for short—was the primary black student group on campus.
The year was 1963, a decade before Kazana would receive word of her termination. The Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ USA” was at the top of the charts. In November, the president of the United States was assassinated. Martin Luther King marched on Washington that summer.
AFRO earned College approval as a student organization in December.
Before Harvard officially recognized AFRO, its foundation was shaky. The group was initially rejected by the Faculty Committee on Student Activities because of its membership clause: “Membership in the Association shall be open to African and Afro-American students currently enrolled at Harvard and Radcliffe.” The Harvard Committee for Undergraduate Affairs deemed the clause “discriminatory.” In December, AFRO voted to reword its membership clause to exclude “African and Afro-American” identity as a requirement for membership.
AFRO went on to become instrumental in sparking changes that swept Harvard and Radcliffe throughout the ’60s and early ’70s. The group undertook a variety of initiatives—ranging from staging sit-ins in support of affirmative action to inviting James Baldwin to speak in Sanders Theater in 1964.
“We were a place for black students to talk about issues, politics, debate what was going on in the country and what our role was in it,” says Jeffrey P. Howard ’69, who served as president of AFRO in its early years. “And after Martin Luther King was killed, we turned to real political activism—we engineered the University’s adoption of an Afro-American Studies department and the cultural center, the DuBois Institute.”
Though Carol B. Allen ’75 is listed as vice president of AFRO in archival records of the club, she says she doesn’t remember being vice president. In fact, she doesn’t remember much about the club at all.“I don’t have fond memories of being in college. It really wasn’t a great experience for me personally,” Allen says. “So I just have a few vague memories here and there of things that [AFRO] did.”But she does remember what it was like, broadly speaking, to be a black student at Radcliffe in the 1970s. She recalls that, at both Harvard and Radcliffe, black students tended to be clustered together in the same houses, and that students sat together based on race in dining halls. She also says there was competition between black students. When she applied to medical school, she remembers feeling as though all of the black students were competing for one spot.
“There was a lot of competition among ourselves, as opposed to what I felt should’ve been real bonding,” she says.
But for Constance B. Hilliard ’71, the first memories of AFRO that come to mind are personal and overwhelmingly positive.
“It was just so important to my life as a student at Radcliffe,” she says. As she describes her time in AFRO over the phone, she effuses warmth, offering anecdotes unprompted.
“And it was important because there I was, an African-American student in an environment that I really wanted to be in, in terms of my studies and learning and so forth, but I just—I felt alienated, and I felt very, very lonely,” she says. “It was a lifesaver. It saved my life.”
“With that being said, I can't think of anything that really stands out, except that for some reason, we seemed to go to a lot of meetings,” she adds, laughing. “And what did we do? I don't know. There was always some reason for us to meet.”
As she speaks, the web of Hilliard’s memories begins to unravel, evolving into a vivid account of AFRO’s initiatives throughout the ’60s. She gradually remembers the activism she was involved in as a member, all closely tied to invaluable changes that bolstered Harvard’s efforts to increase racial equality.
Hilliard, for instance, recalls a sit-in designed to promote increasing enrollment of black students at Radcliffe. According to Assistant Professor of African and African-American Studies and Social Studies Brandon M. Terry ’05, before 1968, there were just a handful of black students accepted at Harvard and Radcliffe each year. Then, in 1969, following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. the number jumped to over 100. “That assassination basically changed everything,” Terry says.
Hilliard’s undergraduate years included this transition. She also remembers AFRO being involved with the fight for the establishment of what was then called the African and Afro-American Studies Department.
In response to the assassination, the University created a Faculty Committee on African and Afro-American Studies—chaired by Henry Rosovsky—which came to be known as the Rosovsky Committee. This committee initially announced that there would be an African and Afro-American Studies “program,” which students perceived as inadequate. Hilliard says that students fought back after this announcement, which ultimately led to the establishment of an autonomous department.
“We also fought for a cultural center, and then a W.E.B. DuBois research center,” she says, and she laughs again. “So now I remember—that’s why we had all those meetings.”
Hilliard and Allen have vague memories of the Afro-American Cultural Center. Hilliard says she remembers that it was “always hard up for money.” Allen says she remembers there being a room in a building. But both say the cultural center did not play a significant role in their undergraduate years.
Nonetheless, William G. Fletcher ’76, another member of AFRO, distinctly remembers Kazana and her efforts to energize the Center.
“Imani was someone, at the time, in her early 20s. She was always encouraging people to come by, to drop in, to hang out there, to have meetings there, so it was a very comfortable, a very safe place,” Fletcher says. “It was definitely a hang out for the black radicals, and not just black radicals—it was a very comfortable space. And I don’t mean just physically comfortable, but you felt like you could be who you were.”
The use of the Sacramento Street space was rooted in policies laid out in the late ’60s. The Rosovsky Committee published a report in 1969 that provided guidelines for implementing an African and Afro-American Studies department and recommended the creation of a cultural center.
Henry Rosovsky, the former Economics professor who chaired the committee, declined to comment on the developments of the AAAS department and the center. Now 90, Rosovsky wrote in an email that he only has vague memories of this time.
Sociology professor Gary T. Marx, who served as one of the youngest members of the committee, says the case for the cultural center rested largely on the need for peer-to-peer cultural exchange.
“The argument was that blacks had to define black culture and express to others, blacks and non-blacks, what it was about,” he says. “It has lots to do with that kind of issue—who can speak for a group?”
Marx’s course Sociology 110: Race and Ethnic Relations was a “happening” on campus in the late ’60s–unenrolled students would drop in to his lectures, using the information as a grounding in which the University community could “[speak] truth to power in a civil way.” This Enlightenment notion of universal access to knowledge, Marx says, underpinned many of the arguments in favor of the cultural center, which would provide space for sharing diverse lived experiences and build a humanistic collective culture for the college.
Following the Rosovsky Committee’s recommendation, the University established an Afro-American Cultural Center Committee was established in late 1969. The committee raised enough money to purchase a building at 20 Sacramento St. that same year.
The cultural center was a three-story Victorian house. The first floor featured a large room—formerly the living room or parlor—that was used for meetings, socializing, and a variety of other periodic events: art exhibits, holiday parties, etc. The second story had four or five rooms occupants designated as offices and administrative space. The third story comprised bedrooms.
For some, the cultural center was a home. The third-floor bedrooms often housed groups that visited campus—Kazana particularly remembers when a Rastafarian cultural group from Jamaica stayed over. And the center also housed “a handful” of Harvard students who couldn’t afford room and board, Kazana says. She agreed to put them up in exchange for “helping out” around the center.
Kazana says she interacted with students she met through the center in unexpected ways. Once, a woman asked her to be her birthing coach.
“In my second year there, because there were few women around, black women, there was this young graduate student,” Kazana says. “She came to me, she said, ‘I’m alone and I really don’t have anyone that I feel comfortable with that I can call upon to be my coach, so will you do this for me.’ So I said okay. I literally went to classes with her, and I was there at the hospital to help her get through the labor process and to give birth to her child.”
Kazana applied and was hired as director of the center shortly after graduating from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst with a degree in African-American Studies in 1972. Students ran the search for a director by themselves, she says—and, aside from Kazana and a secretary, the administrative board of the center consisted wholly of work-study students.
The center briefly shared the Sacramento Street space with a daycare center primarily for minority children. Today, the building houses a feminist counseling practice.
Though the center was intended mainly for African-American students, Kazana says the space was home to student groups of all kinds–groups that focused on issues ranging from socialism to anti-apartheid activism. Kazana says she had a dream the cultural center would eventually expand into a space more in line with the Undergraduate Council’s vision of a multicultural center today.
“I remember quite distinctly that we became very close to a small group of Chinese students and they didn’t have any place at all, so this is how we kind of got into the idea that when we could expand and get bigger and better, at some point we would want to become a third world student center and expand our membership to everyone—all people of color,” she says.
Yet the center didn’t suit the ideals of every black student. George H. Yeadon III ’75, a member of AFRO, says he saw the cultural center as a “knee-jerk reaction” to the protests of the late ’60s. He thought the University was trying to be helpful—but he thought Harvard did not know how to go about it the right way.
Yeadon, who doesn’t live in the Boston area, is in town for a Harvard Alumni Association conference. The lobby of the Charles Hotel where we meet is nothing short of chaotic, humming with the excitement of alumni catching up with old friends and reminiscing about their glory days. In the midst of this collective remembering, Yeadon pieces together his college experience.
The Cultural Center wasn’t a hangout spot for Yeadon or his friends, he says, adding that “more radical” groups would use the center as a meeting place.
Nevertheless, the Center left a lingering mark on some. Two years ago, one of the students Kazana once housed at the Center phoned her to thank her.
“I interviewed him, and we agreed to let him live there in the Cultural Center, on the third floor. We gave him some responsibility, and he told me that that was really the first time that anybody had ever given him a responsibility,” Kazana says. “And that was what most impressed him—not so much that he had a place to live, which he obviously did, because he didn’t have an option. But he said that I had shown faith in him, as a human being, to be responsible for something.”
Kazana remembers a push in the spring of 1974 for the relocation of the Cultural Center to 74 Mt. Auburn St., a bigger and more central building. Ultimately, this push was unsuccessful, and the Center continued to struggle for money. That summer, Kazana received the letter from the University declaring her services no longer necessary.
Though the summer of 1974 marked the closing of the 20 Sacramento St. Cultural Center, student efforts and activism for the establishment of a Third World Cultural Center—the multicultural center that Kazana envisioned—persisted. Other physical spaces on campus devoted to diversity cropped up and promptly disappeared throughout the ’70s and ’80s. In 1975, a center opened at 1750 Cambridge St, and in 1978, a flyer listed 17 South St. as the center’s location. None lasted.
The 1970s saw changes in the landscape of black student groups on campus, allowing new organizations to take up the fight for a physical space. Following the “petering out” of AFRO, as one BSA member put it, the Harvard-Radcliffe Black Students Association earned official recognition in Dec. 1977.

Fletcher and several other early members of the BSA remember a Mass. Hall “takeover” as a poignant moment of activism. The takeover, which aimed to combat Harvard’s indirect support of South African apartheid via its oil holdings there, is one of the few events that stand out in Allen’s memory.
“I remember the chant that we used to use as we were circling around outside, which was ‘U.S. out of Southeast Asia, Harvard out of Gulf,’” she says. (Others remember the same chant, word for word, after nearly 50 years.) “So that's the thought that comes to mind whenever I think about action back then. I believe I was a freshman at the time, so that would've been ’71, ’72. Derek Bok was the president at that time.”
Derek C. Bok became president of Harvard in 1971. He wrote in an email that he “vaguely” remembers an African-American student center springing up in 1969, before he took the position. “I also remember a sit-in by black students in Massachusetts Hall during my first spring in office, but that was led by a law student and, in any event, I had no contact with the students involved during and after their occupation,” Bok writes.
June V. Cross ’75, who reported on racial activism for The Crimson, compared the Mass. Hall demonstration to the Occupy movement. Students camped out at the administrative building for six days.
“It was awesome,” Cross says. “It was a coming-together and a sense of possibility and change, in a mass action against the administration. It felt like we actually achieved something.” (By the late ’80s, Harvard “selectively” divested from its Gulf oil holdings.)
Fletcher says that many of the people who were involved with the takeover formed a group that he called the “Black Collective.” He adds that in the AFRO board elections of 1973, the members of this collective refused to run for positions because they felt that AFRO was “going to fall apart.”
1973 also marked the advent of several new groups on campus that further decentralized AFRO: the Organization for the Solidarity of Third World Students and a Harvard chapter of the national February 1st movement—a “black radical organization”—among them.
The OSTWS, Fletcher says, “brought together radical students, black, Asian, Latino, to work together, and it lasted until I think about ’75. And it became a major site for some of the more politically active black students.”
When the BSA formed on campus in 1977, it sparked controversy similar to that which AFRO faced in its infancy, according to Cross. Cross says this tension is reflective of the racial climate black students faced at Harvard broadly.
“I think our entire existence on campus was being questioned,” she says.
In November of 1979, the BSA distributed a newspaper called Nexus, covering topics from the W.E.B. DuBois Institute to the African and African American Studies Department. The paper lists six objectives under the headline “BSA Confirms Themes and Goals,” the second of which is “establishing a Third World Cultural Center.”
Aaron A. Estis ’80, a member of the BSA, remembers that, for a brief time, the University again provided a location for yet another short-lived Cultural Center.
“Somehow or another, some other activists in BSA convinced the University to give us access to this building. It was really just a small little house,” he says. “We called it the Afro-American Cultural Center. And so we were successful in getting that. It was important because we used it to organize events and activities and people could meet there.”
John A. “Tony” Butler ’80, another member of the BSA, also recalls the fight for a cultural center, but says his memories of the openings and closing of various centers are unclear.
“I do remember that we were trying to get it to be reopened or get another location for it. I remember something about us trying to get it reinvigorated, reestablished,” he says. “But I don't recall physically where we were gathering.”
When we ask Anthony R. Chase ’77, BSA’s first president, if the group had a physical space, he just laughs.
The shuttering of the Sacramento Street Afro-American Cultural Center in 1974 did not end the debate about whether there should be a physical space on campus for students of color. Many of the same threads that defined campus discussions around the Afro-American Cultural Center in the ’70s still hum today, as student activists on campus push for university support of a physical space for belonging.
Since the closing of the Afro-American Cultural Center, the University has orchestrated other initiatives to foster inclusivity and diversity on campus. Bok wrote in an email that, in response to requests for a Cultural Center, the University instead created the Harvard Foundation in 1981. Bok wrote that the Foundation “did a great job under the leadership of the late Allen Counter of bringing students of all races together in a series of projects over the ensuing years.”
But while the Harvard Foundation does work to promote better race relations on campus, it still does not provide a physical space for students of color.
“The Foundation does incredible work, but it's not a place where students go and sit and hang out and have gatherings. The students, besides the interns, don’t feel as though they own the space,” says Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19, a co-chair of the Undergraduate Council’s “Multicultural Center Coalition,” which aims to eventually create a physical space for belonging on campus.
“That’s the same for most of the physical spaces on campus that are dedicated to these sorts of issues,” Whittaker adds. “They're dedicated at an administrative or policy level. That's not a bad thing. We need those spaces, too. But what we’ve realized is students are not looking for just another Harvard Foundation.”
Salma Abdelrahman ’20, the other co-chair of the UC’s multicultural center coalition, says she believes the University should have responsibility beyond just providing a location for a multicultural center.
“A commitment means financial support, it means being willing to hire staff, it means being willing to put those measures in place in order to make this a long-term thing that is stable and that has a presence on this campus for longer than four years,” she says.
It seems these concerns mirror the landscape of 1972, when students themselves ran the job search for the director of the Afro-American Cultural Center. Also still relevant is the connection between a physical space on campus and space in the University consciousness broadly. Whittaker offers the example of final clubs—traditionally all-male, exclusive social societies housed in mansions in the middle of campus that have come under administrative fire in recent years.
“We wouldn't have spent this much time and energy as a campus and a community discussing them if they hadn't had so much physical space. Essential to the conversation was the physicality of their presence on this campus,” Whittaker says of the clubs.
In the same way, Whittaker says, a physical space on campus for students of color would draw attention to and foster conversation about relevant issues.
Whittaker also says that the underground venues occupied by the Harvard Foundation and other diversity offices means the groups are “tucked away from the rest of the community.” The Women’s Center operates out of the basement of Canaday, the Diversity Peer Educators’ and BGLTQ offices are in the basement of Grays Hall, and the Harvard Foundation is located in the basement of Thayer Hall.
In response to these criticisms, Roland S. Davis, Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion, wrote in an emailed statement the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Office prioritizes accessibility.
“One of the most important parts of EDI’s mission is to make sure that everyone feels welcome and that students can get to our offices easily,” David wrote. “To that end, we are delighted to now have all of our offices located in the yard. In addition, it is important to note that our new space in Grays Hall is fully ADA accessible, which is a huge improvement over their previous space.”
Whittaker’s criticism of these offices’ locations recalls the flaws that led to the original cultural center’s demise. Bill Fletcher points to its lack of centrality as a reason the building was ultimately unsuccessful. Students had to make a conscious effort to go there, he says.
Today, they have nowhere to go.
When we tell Imani Kazana about the current debate over a multicultural center, she responds with a short burst of laughter.
“It’s never happened? Oh Lord, okay,” she says. “That’s sad.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Mind Brain Behavior Interfaculty Initiative has formed a faculty committee to investigate the potential for offering an interdisciplinary “cognitive science” concentration at the College.
Responding to interest from undergraduates in the Harvard Society for Mind Brain and Behavior, the committee is exploring prospective new courses and class requirements for students who want to study the function of the mind and brain from an interdisciplinary perspective. The initiative hopes to offer courses by 2020.
Undergraduates who want to study cognitive science currently must choose the Mind Brain Behavior track, available for students in seven participating concentrations: psychology, neurobiology, philosophy, linguistics, computer science, human evolutionary biology, and history of science.
Psychology Professor Alfonso Caramazza, a faculty co-director of MBB, founded a cognitive science program at Johns Hopkins University before coming to Harvard. Caramazza described cognitive science as “the study of the mind as a computational system.”
Caramazza said he believes the mind and brain can be better understood by combining the approaches and expertise of researchers in various fields, and said he hopes the committee will build a concentration where students will focus on at least two tracks within the concentration, such as “language in the mind” or “cognition and computation.”
The faculty committee is currently discussing the substance and structure of the possible program, but has not yet proposed a plan to College administrators, according to Caramazza.
The current plan is for a concentration run by a committee—much like Social Studies—with no concentration-specific department or professors.
Psychology Professor Samuel J. Gershman, a member of the committee, said they were considering developing new courses as part of the prospective concentration curriculum.
“I’ve been involved in discussions about an introductory course in cognitive science,” Gershman said. He also said the committee has discussed sophomore tutorials.
Gabriel J. Grand ‘18, former board chair of HSMBB, brought up the idea of a concentration with faculty members.
“Right now it’s this umbrella where you have all these different concentrations, and then underneath it is MBB. The goal of this concentration is to just invert that structure so there is one cognitive science concentration, and within that you can specialize in whatever direction you’re interested in,” Grand said.
Without a concentration, there are fewer opportunities to interact with other students who study MBB, Grand added.
“Because MBB is very large, because it pulls from seven different concentrations, it means that there is no centralized student community surrounding the concentration,” Grand said. “I don’t even know most of the other MBB track concentrators in my year.”
Kayla U. Evans ‘19, another advocate for a cognitive science concentration, pointed out that all existing MBB tracks require a thesis, while a cognitive science concentration might not.
“I’m no longer [concentrating in] MBB,” Evans said, “partly because MBB requires a thesis.”
Both Caramazza and Gershman said there might be challenges with the College’s “depth” and “breadth” requirements, however, in building a concentration whose methodology and subject matter are so expansive.
“One thing that we've been trying to do is balance the need for coherence with the need for flexibility,” Gershman said. “The dream of cognitive science is that we could identify these common ideas or principles that cut through different interdisciplinary boundaries.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School will honor the accomplishments of black alumni this spring to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the school's African-American Student Union.
The AASU50 celebration—a joint effort between the AASU and the HBS Leadership Initiative—kicked off with the opening of an exhibit showcasing experiences and achievements of black alumni at Baker Library Friday. It will culminate with a conference in mid-April.
AASU50 Project Director Taran Swan said members of the Leadership Initiative have spent two and a half years planning the celebration, which will include an academic symposium on African American leadership in March.
Though AASU was founded in 1968, the legacy of African-Americans at HBS extends back more than a century, according to Anthony Mayo, the Director of the Leadership Initiative.
Wendell Thomas Cunningham, the school’s first black student, graduated in 1915, but minority enrollment remained low for the next few decades. The lack of diversity was among the primary concerns of the five HBS students who coalesced to form AASU.
These five, Clifford E. Darden, E. Theodore Lewis, Jr., Lillian Lincoln Lambert, George R. Price, and A. Leroy Willis, approached former HBS Dean George P. Baker with a series of requests aimed at increasing representation of black students and faculty on campus.
The founders also worked to recruit black college students to HBS themselves. Their efforts resulted in more than a fourfold increase in enrollment of black students at HBS between 1968 and 1969, according to Mayo.
Their experiences and the history of AASU are chronicled in cases at the Baker Library exhibit. It also includes an interactive display that showcases other notable alumni and panels featuring three black professors at HBS.
The two-day conference in April will open with an alumni dinner and the premiere of a documentary that chronicles the experiences of black students at HBS. The following day will feature small-group discussions with prominent black executives and entrepreneurs as well as AASU founding members Lewis, Lambert, and Willis.
“Friday, we'll be looking back, celebrating the past," Mayo said. "Saturday is about looking forward and thinking about what is the future and how do we think about race relations, how do we think about black business leadership, how do we think about contributions to society."
AASU has been focused on these issues since its inception. Swan, who was a member of the group in the early 1990s, said the organization has consistently reacted to topical political and social movements while simultaneously providing a community for black HBS students.
“I think a lot of what makes [AASU] different from year to year is what’s going on in society,” Swan said, adding that the group has taken part in activism involving movements such as Black Lives Matter.
While the conference is primarily “alumni-focused,” Mayo said he estimates about 90 current HBS students will attend. He said the Leadership Initiative issued a formal invitation to all black students at HBS, but the event is open to students of all racial backgrounds.
Diamond M. Richardson, a first-year student at HBS and co-founder of Thrive, an online platform that supports women of color in business and tech industries, said she is excited to attend the conference, and hopes to see non-black students there as well.
“You really do have to have not just black people working on this, but you have to have allies who feel invested in the black community as well,” Richards said. “So I really hope there are students from across the ethnic perspective at HBS who come to the conference.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 2, 2018 at 11:09 p.m.
In a month and a half, some undergraduates will be eligible to step into booths, grab pencil and paper, and fill out a ballot to determine whether eligible Harvard student teaching staff can form a union—but many College students say they remain unaware of what this means.
In particular, some undergraduate teaching fellows and course assistants say they did not realize they would have to pay dues if unionization supporters prevail. Of roughly a dozen students reached by The Crimson Tuesday who taught courses this year, the vast majority—nine (which included five students teaching this semester)—said they had no idea unionization might come with a fee.
Others are totally unaware of the years-long push to unionize.
“What is unionization?” said John Na ’20, an undergraduate teaching fellow for the fall course CS50.
Harvard will hold a second unionization election April 18 and 19 to decide whether graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants can collectively bargain with the University. The election follows an extended legal battle between unionization advocates and the University over the validity of the results of the original Nov. 2016 election, which showed 1,526 votes against unionization and 1,396 in favor. According to an NLRB election order, undergraduate students must teach courses this semester to be eligible to vote.
If the second election’s results fall in favor of unionization, Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers—the group making a bid to represent Harvard’s eligible teaching staff—would solicit a percentage of each union member’s salary as dues in order to hire organizers, fund strikes, and retain legal counsel.
The UAW’s base rate for members is set at a minimum of 1.44 percent of monthly wages. Per UAW policy, the money collected from members is split between the local UAW, the international UAW, and the Strike and Defense Fund.
Union advocate Evan C. Mackay ’19—who has served as a teaching fellow for multiple Statistics courses—said he thinks pay increases from collective bargaining would outweigh the cost of dues.
“Currently, the way that I understand it is that the union dues would be the same for undergraduates as graduate students,” said Mackay, who is teaching this semester. “I know that 1.44 percent would be coming out for me, but looking into the research that I’ve done, I know that would be overcome by the increase in wages that a union can help provide.”
Other students eligible to vote in the election said they are surprised they have to pay dues at all.
Sathvik R. Sudireddy ’19, a current teaching fellow, said he has heard “a little bit” about the nuances of the student unionization effort but did not know undergraduates could be required to pay union dues.
“I think money is not the most important to me, personally, when I TF a course. It’s more about the experience and the satisfaction I get from teaching other undergraduates,” Sudireddy said. “But I can see why other TFs might find it very unfair, because we don’t get paid that much as it is.”
Ellen Li ’20, who is a current Math 25 course assistant, wrote in an email that she felt not “fully informed” about the April election.
“I have not received any information about the upcoming unionization election from the university,” Li wrote.
Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an email earlier this month that the University aims to finalize the eligible voter list for the April election and contact eligible voters by March 12.
Li added that her impression was that her colleagues are similarly unaware of the issues surrounding unionization.
“It seems that many other undergraduate CA's/TF's are also not aware of this,” Li wrote.
Per the election agreement between the University and Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers, all eligible undergraduate TFs and CAs would be part of a bargaining unit if the union wins the election, regardless of their position on unionization or their participation in the election. Union members, including unionized undergraduates, would be able to vote to approve any contracts negotiated by HGSU-UAW.
In the run-up to the 2016 unionization election, anti-unionization students cited dues as a drawback of voting to collectively bargain, especially the portion of dues that union members would pay to the national and international UAW.
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: March 2, 2018
 A previous version of this article misstated the eligibility of undergraduate teaching fellows to vote in the unionization election. In fact, only undergraduates teaching this semester are eligible to vote.
CORRECTION: March 2, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Tyler E. Griggs '20 as a statistics course assistant. In fact, he was a course assistant for CS50.

Students at Harvard Medical School and the School of Public Health joined affiliates of Harvard’s teaching hospitals to take a group photo protesting gun violence in the wake of a Parkland, Fla. school shooting that killed 17 people.
They assembled Tuesday afternoon in front of Gordon Hall on the campus of Harvard Medical School, where they were photographed holding a banner that read “Gun reform is healthcare reform.” Individual students held signs that read “Gun control is doctor recommended” and “Gun violence is a public health issue.”
Shivangi Goel, a co-president of the HMS Class of 2021 student council, organized and spoke at the event.
“Medical providers and scientists devote their whole lives to ameliorating the lives of their patients. It seems ridiculous that guns and people with guns can undo all of that, and hurt those who we work desperately each day to save,” she wrote in an email.
Goel also wrote that in her first two years as an emergency medical technician, she saw two patients who were victims of gun violence—one died, and the other sustained severe injuries.
“Since then I have been a staunch believer in the idea that saving lives will always matter more to me than protecting guns,” Goel wrote.
Chana A. Sacks, a doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital, spoke after Goel. Sacks’s cousin was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. in 2012.
She called on healthcare professionals to ensure that gun violence stays in the headlines even when memories of the most recent mass shooting have faded, according to a press release from the School of Public Health.
The students are not the only people in Longwood advocating gun reform: After the Parkland shooting, School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams wrote a letter to school affiliates calling for more gun violence research.
Both Williams and Goel took a stance against the Dickey Amendment, a 1996 stipulation that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cannot “advocate or promote gun control.”
According to Goel, the students plan to continue their activism next month, with a walk-out on March 14 and the Boston “March for Our Lives” demonstration on March 24.

Two Harvard Law professors have joined nearly 140 professors from universities across the country in signing a public letter that critiques what the authors call “victim-centered practices” in higher education sexual harassment policies and procedures.
Law professors Janet E. Halley and Elizabeth Bartholet ’62 signed the letter three weeks ago, along with academics hailing from institutions including Northwestern University and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
“‘Victim-centered’ practices… threaten to subvert the objective collection and presentation of evidence in administrative, civil, and criminal sexual assault proceedings,” the letter reads.
The letter states these victim-centered practices are based in the “believe the victim” ideology they say sprang up in the 1990s. The document’s authors assert that supporters of this ideology called for “swift and unquestioning judgments about the facts of [sexual] harassment without standard evidentiary procedures.”
The letter culminates in a “call to restore due process and fundamental fairness” in university sexual harassment cases by ending the “use of victim-centered, trauma-informed, and believe the victim practices.”
At Harvard, Halley has been one of the most outspoken critics of policies and procedures pertaining to sexual assault cases. When the University adopted new sexual harassment policies in the fall of 2014, Halley numbered among the 28 signatories of an open letter that criticized these changes.
Halley and Bartholet also comprised two of the four Harvard Law School faculty members who submitted a memo to the U.S. Department of Justice last year asking for a review of the standards outlined in the 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter. That letter was an Obama-era order directed colleges and universities receiving federal funding to “use a lower standard of proof” in sexual assault cases as well as establishing a broader definition of the term sexual harassment. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos rescinded those guidelines in September.
Halley said in an interview Tuesday she signed the recent open letter because it aligned with her belief  that the policies and procedures on sexual assault need to be revised.
“I signed it because I thought it was correct. I’ve seen the bad effects of politically slanted training,” Halley said.

Monuments are central to contemporary efforts to grapple with the past, University President Drew G. Faust and several prominent humanities professors argued at a Graduate School of Design event Tuesday evening.
The event, hosted by the Harvard University Committee on the Arts and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, focused on the politics of monuments—referencing famous monuments from the Vietnam Veterans and 9/11 Memorials to controversial Civil War tributes that have sparked recent discourse over their place in the contemporary world.
In her opening remarks, Faust described monuments as an “extremely timely topic.” A Civil War historian by trade, she recounted the origins of Confederate monuments across the country.
“In the half century after the war ended, there was a rewriting of the war as a lost and noble cause,” Faust said, explaining that monuments played a large role in that process.
Some of those monuments have been removed in recent years.
Faust ended by emphasizing the “the opportunity and responsibility of art doing the work of just memory.”
The University itself has grappled with historical links to the Civil War and slavery. Faust joined congressman and civil rights leader John R. Lewis in April 2016 to dedicate a plaque to four enslaved persons who lived and worked on Harvard’s campus in the 18th century.
Faust was followed by an array of professors who discussed the sociopolitical issues underlying monuments and the methods artists can employ to bridge the gap between the past and present.
History of Art and Architecture and African and African American Studies Professor Sarah E. Lewis ’01 spoke about issues of race in American political monuments, and proposed considering “what must have had to happen” for the Jefferson Memorial and Martin Luther King Jr. memorials to be displayed opposite each other.
“Together, the memorials function as a monument. They do what monuments do best, often without our acknowledging it: they shift us to this conditional tense. They shift us to consider this idea,” Lewis said.
Design School Professor Krzysztof Wodiczko spoke at length about his work on the Goethe-Schiller Monument in Weimar, Germany. Wodiczko focused on how animation and modern production techniques can take painful pasts and create hope for the future.
“The past cannot be changed. The light and sound of projection and one’s movement, gesture and speech animating it represent the possibility of healthier, non-melancholic life with such a past, and the potential for moving with one’s own life, having a future despite the past, however overwhelming and traumatic.”
Jennifer L. Roberts, a History of Art and Architecture professor followed, discussing the counter-monument movement, which seeks to increase viewer participation in monumental works and invert conventional monumental themes. Roberts focused upon the colorful works of American artist Spencer Finch, including a paper installation at the 9/11 memorial in New York City.
“Traditional monuments are permanent, massive, elevated, and usually figurative. Over the past 40 years, the development of counter-monumental practices has seen each of these qualities challenged and often literally overturned,” Roberts said.
Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey, an art historian, then analyzed the relationship between Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial and photography. He analyzed how the memorial resisted the rising influence of photography in monumental architecture, while simultaneously reinventing photography through its reflective surfaces.
The presentations were followed by a panel discussion led by Professors Homi K. Bhabha and Erika Naginski.

The College is working to debut a gender-neutral housing option for first-year students starting next year with the Class of 2022, according to Harvard administrators.
Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, wrote in an email to The Crimson last week that his office “has been working closely” with the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Housing Office to “create a gender-inclusive housing option” that would be available to freshmen starting in the fall of 2018.
Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that several “current undergraduates” are also workshopping the proposal.
“Gender inclusive housing acknowledges and affirms gender diversity as a critical aspect of our campus community, and we are excited about our efforts to expand our current offerings to include first-year students,” Goldman wrote.
He declined to give more specifics, adding that the College “looks forward to having more details to share in near future.”
While it remains unclear exactly how a “gender-neutral” housing system would operate, the setup would likely allow all gender identities to room together in whatever combination the individuals choose.
Currently, Harvard does not offer gender-neutral living arrangements for freshmen. Since 2014, though, all rising sophomores, juniors and seniors have been able to request gender-neutral rooms in their upperclassmen Houses.
“Rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors may request to form mixed-gender rooming groups,” the Harvard College Student Handbook asserts. “All occupants must voluntarily agree to the arrangements and must sign a gender neutral housing contract confirming their agreement.”
Students on campus have been urging College administrators to expand gender-neutral housing to freshmen for at least a year. In the fall of 2017, following advocacy from the Trans Task Force, the Freshman Dean’s Office and the BGLTQ Office formed a committee that aimed to draft a proposal laying out options for first-year gender-inclusive living spaces.
The committee included members of the Trans Task Force, the BGLTQ Office, the FDO, and the Office of Student Life.
The group has never released a public report of any kind—but, speaking at a panel at the Democracy Center in Sept. 2017, Scarborough said Harvard was reviewing proposals to add gender-neutral housing for freshmen.
After the panel, the FDO and the BGLTQ Office released a joint statement outlining the status of efforts to create gender-inclusive living option at the time.
“Students and staff from the FDO and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life are currently exploring options for expanding gender-inclusive housing to the first year class,” the statement read.
One logistical concern posed by gender-neutral rooming arrangements is the fact that some students are under the age of 18 when they arrive on campus. Undergraduates’ underage status could complicate the College’s decision to offer mixed-gender housing.
On issues like these, the committee has sought legal advice from Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel, Resident Dean of Freshmen for Ivy Yard Michael C. Ranen told The Crimson in Nov. 2017.
Ranen also said at the time that the committee was looking to other universities to evaluate how they approached gender-inclusive living options.
“The models are that most schools do not offer gender-inclusive housing for first-year students,” Ranen said in November. “If students are under 18, they usually require parental consent.”

UPDATED: March 1, 2018 at 7:18 a.m.
Panelists shared personal stories, advice, and a range of historical experiences related to sexual violence at Harvard at an event Tuesday afternoon co-hosted by Our Harvard Can Do Better and the Radcliffe Union of Students.
The second event of the 2018 Women’s Week, the panel featured Law School Professor Diane L. Rosenfeld, Shane Snowdon ’78, Emily Fox-Penner ’17, and Crimson magazine chair Marella A. Gayla ’19.
Snowdon discussed Harvard in the 70s, while Fox-Penner highlighted the more recent work of Our Harvard Can Do Better, a group which advocates for an end to sexual violence at Harvard, with a focus on Title IX policies and enforcement at the College.
Snowdon said the use and interpretation of Title IX has drastically changed over past decades, adapting from a focus on equal opportunity in athletics to issues including gender violence.
“It was not until the early 80s that Title IX was remotely considered to be something that could be used in relation to gender violence. Title IX was considered only in the context of athletics,  and it had a very weak effect on athletics,” Snowden said.
Gayla, who has written about the history of sexual violence at Harvard for The Crimson, also noted the change, particularly in the language used when discussing sexual assault and rape. For the article, she interviewed alumni who graduated from Harvard or Radcliffe in between the 60s and the 80s.
“When I was pretty early in the reporting process, I had a number of calls that felt like duds for me because I would say “What about Title IX?” and they would just say “Oh, I wasn’t an athlete,’” Gayla said.
Gayla said after speaking with Title IX coordinator Emily J. Miller, she realized she was using the wrong language in her questions.
“I found that the language we use to talk about sexual violence changes so much generationally,” Gayla said.
Snowden said in the 70s, there was not much institutional support at the University for undergraduate women who advocated against gender violence and harassment and they sometimes had to meet in secret.
“We did not dream of an institutional response. It took us months even to get a meeting with the head of campus police,” she said. “We knew that whenever a woman went to campus or local police, the first questions, because this is the 70s, were ‘What were you wearing? What were you doing there? What were you doing there then?’ We knew about that and that all we had was each other.”
Rosenfeld offered advice on activism for current students, encouraging them to demand an audience with the administration, especially with University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow.
“There is absolutely power in numbers. Gather your student groups and have meetings and meetings and meetings with the new President, even before he takes office. Let him know that you need to be on his radar,” Rosenfeld said.
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, an active member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, moderated Tuesday’s panel and urged students to stand up for what they believe in.
“Students have had and continue to have an incredible power to organize for change,” Goldberg said.

The Kuumba Singers of Harvard College’s wrapped up their 20th annual Black Arts Festival concluded with a brunch on Sunday celebrating and reflecting on a week of events dedicated to creating and celebrating work by black artists.
While Kuumba focuses primarily on song, their week-long arts festival is more broadly oriented, with topics that range from writing to film.
“I think it’s important for people to understand that Kuumba is not just a choir, BAF co-chair Olutoyin Demuren ’18 said. “Kuumba is this artistic space that is really unique of this campus.”
According to Demuren, the goal of the festival is to highlight Kuumba’s legacy—which she said began in the 1970s amid high racial tensions on campus—while connecting the work of black artists to a broader historical context.
Demuren and fellow co-chair Lindiwe P. Makgalemele ’18 said they started planning for the festival last spring shortly after being elected to its planning committee in the spring.  Kuumba President Marcus K. Granderson ’18, who formerly chaired the BAF committee, noted that Demuren and Makgalemele’s roles required significant personal commitment.
“It’s a really involved process. You start in the spring. Then you spend the summer thinking about your theme,” Granderson  said. “You’re a producer; you’re a finance chair; you’re publicity; you’re a spokesperson. You’re the face of BAF. As BAF chair or committee, you do everything.”
A particular focus of the festival is to host black artists across a wide range of skill levels and backgrounds, Demuren said.
“BAF gives voice to so many different types of art that don’t get attention on this campus and in general. It also highlights an artistic heritage for a people that have a long history of struggling but also hope and promise,” Granderson said.
Demuren added that the festival seeks to connect art with broader societal themes and highlight a variety of narratives experienced by black communities.
“There is a lot of power in art, in the creation of art, and in representation through art to represent experiences often marginalized and to show a diversity of stories that aren't always heard,” Demuren said. “Sometimes, there’s just one story that comes out off communities.”
Though Kuumba is a College-recognized undergraduate organization, not all BAF events were limited to Harvard affiliates. For example, their first event, a masterclass with Grammy Award-winning singer Jill Scott, was open to the public.
“I was really happy we were able to open [the Jill Scott masterclass event] up to members of the community because the ability for the community, and not just the Harvard community, to have access to the kind of honesty and authenticity that Jill Scott was able to produce was really powerful,” Demuren said.
Kuumba members said they thought the masterclass event, which also featured student performers and Music Professor Esperanza Spalding, was among the highlights of the festival.
“I have planned BAF, been to BAF events, and I have been to multiple events at Harvard and in the black community, but [the masterclass] is probably the most inspiring, fulfilling, emotionally raw, and honest event I have ever been to,” Granderson said. “I felt honored to be in that space as the exchange of art and humanity was taking place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

March has descended upon us.
To the casual sports fan, it is now time to create bracket pools, re-download the March Madness app, and quickly obtain a College Basketball 101 of how fringe teams in the A-10, MAAC, and yes, Ivy League have performed. Everyone knows that one guy who can give a halfhearted yet cogent breakdown of the No. 13 seed school no one has ever heard of. Or taking credit when the Florida Gulf Coasts and La Salles of the basketball ecosystem make it past the first weekend.
If you are that guy, here is your chance to quickly acquaint yourself with the 2017-2018 Harvard basketball season and the Ivy League. Trust me, this will be quick and painless. Then you can go shamelessly back to watching Trae Young’s 30-foot highlights and hating on Grayson Allen.
I present you the Harvard Crimson Basketball FAQs.
How is the team playing this season? Who is playing well?
Ah, the classic one.
The easy answer is this: 15-12 overall after a challenging non-conference schedule with opponents like Kentucky and Minnesota. 10-2 in Ivy League play and second only to Penn, whose sole Ivy loss was to Harvard.
Before the start of play in the Ancient Eight, the Crimson held its ground with tight defeats to the aforementioned Wildcats and Gophers. However, shooting woes and inconsistent play haunted Harvard against some of its lesser opponents, leading to disappointing losses against Holy Cross, Manhattan, and George Washington.
Fast forward to today. Team performance on the court has improved, a combination of re-discovered perimeter accuracy and lock-down defense throughout the conference season. The Crimson is situated as the second seed in the Ivy League heading into the final weekend of play, despite losing arguably its top player in sophomore guard Bryce Aiken to a knee injury for much of the calendar year. More on this later.
In his absence, sophomore forwards Chris Lewis and Seth Towns have taken on the offensive load. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, who is currently in his 11th year leading the team, has emphasized “inside-out” basketball.
Amaker’s main interior anchor in this style of play? Lewis, a 6-foot-9, 235-pound big man who deploys a traditional back-to-the-basket, post-up game.
Ranked No. 68 nationally on the ESPN 100 coming out of high school—the highest-ranked recruit ever to come to Harvard—Lewis is averaging 12.1 points this season and has the highest field goal percentage—60.6—in the Ivies. Primarily deploying backboard hook-shots and relying on an effective left-handed finish, the sophomore scored a career-high 25 points in the Crimson’s victory over Penn on Feb. 10.
The other offensive centerpiece, Towns, has put up even more impressive numbers in the Ancient Eight. Leading the Ivies in scoring and averaging 15.8 points per game this season, Towns has been Amaker’s go-to man late in games.
The sophomore recently said that he models his game after James Harden. Unsurprisingly, the Columbus, Ohio, native—who turned down offers from Ohio State and Michigan to come to Cambridge—has taken on the isolation, slash-to-the-paint playing style of the Houston superstar. 
Defensively, sophomore forward Justin Bassey is Amaker’s “MVP.” Marking up on the opponent’s lead offensive weapon, Bassey has contributed largely to Harvard’s defensive efficiency, one of the top in the nation. The Crimson has held Ancient Eight opponents to just 63.2 points this season.
Oh yes, what about Bryce?
The outlook on the point guard is poor, and he is highly questionable to return back to the court this season, according to Amaker.
“[The knee] is just not progressing the way we need it to or he wanted it to put him in a position to feel comfortable,” said Amaker in a Feb. 28 press conference. “I don’t anticipate that changing as we go down the stretch.”
In his place, sophomore guard Christian Juzang has taken over almost literally all of the minutes at the point guard position. For context, Juzang has played in an average of 40 minutes in the last five games. Without another reserve point guard on Amaker’s healthy roster, the Crimson has seen two 20-plus point games from Juzang since early February. Two weeks ago, Juzang combined for seven triples and 11 made field goals in two contests.  
Another theme for this season, according to Amaker? Improved contribution from the reserves.
“We talk so much about our bench and our balance,” said Amaker after the Feb. 9 win. “You look at our stat sheet, we had tremendous balance. Henry Welsh off the bench gave us great minutes. Robert Baker had a few plays, a big block, big defensive rebounds here and there.”
So what do we need to do to make March Madness?
This is where things get complicated. Only one representative from the Ivy League will qualify.
To do so, the Crimson will need to win a four-team playoff held in Philadelphia, Pa., on March 10-11 at the Quaker’s home ground, the Palestra.
Last year’s victor, Princeton, capped off an undefeated conference season with a trip to Buffalo, where it fell in the last minute to fifth-seeded Notre Dame. Having lost three key seniors from last season, the Tigers currently are tied for seventh in the conference table. Let’s just say they need a miracle to even make the four-team Ivy Tournament.
So where does this leave everyone else? The topdog this year is Penn, which carried an experienced team forward when most of its competitors, including the Crimson, are breeding youth in their programs. The Quakers just beat Harvard by three last weekend, leaving them situated at the top of the Ancient Eight with an 11-1 record. Full breakdown below:
1. Penn 11-12. Harvard 10-2 3. Yale 7-54. Cornell 5-75. Columbia 5-76. Princeton 4-87. Brown 4-88. Dartmouth 2-10
There you go. Two games left in the regular season for each team. Top four seeds make the conference tournament. Winner qualifies for the first round of March Madness. Given how late the tournament is played, Selection Sunday will also be the same day as the championship game.
A whirlwind of emotions for the victor, to say the least.
But wait, tell me more about this tournament. How are teams seeded?
The Ivy League is notoriously stubborn. So stubborn that only last season did it abandon the antiquated round-robin, winner-take-all format of the past. No more hunched-over fans watching on laptops at a remote Dartmouth-Yale game to determine the Crimson’s postseason fate. It’s time for the playoffs, baby.
For the second straight year, the tournament will be held at the historic Palestra. Massive home-court advantage, you might say? That’s one side of the coin. The flip side is that no other Ivy League location can seat more than 7,000 fans. Philly really likes its sports teams. Sorry about that, Cambridge. Or New Haven. Or Ithaca. Yes, even Ithaca. I apologize.
“It was a pretty cool experience,” said freshman forward Danilo Djuricic after his first game at the Palestra on Feb. 24, in which the Crimson fell 74-71. “It’s a great gym with a lot of history, and I am looking forward to returning and making sure there is a different result.”
Obviously, the top four teams with the best conference records qualify. But here is time for even more breakdown of the esoteric tiebreaker rules. Bear with me.
If two teams are tied, the team with the best head-to-head record against each other is seeded higher. What if two teams split their season series? Then it goes to the head-to-head of the next highest seeded conference team. So basically here, who has the better record against No. 3 Yale? Same record against Yale? Go down to the record of the No. 4 team. Get it?
So what does Harvard have to do this weekend to be the No.1 seed at the Ivy League Tournament?
There are four possible situations. Harvard plays Cornell and Columbia, while Penn plays Yale and Brown this weekend. Essentially, Penn needs to lose at least one game to be jumped by the Crimson. Here are the desired scenarios for Harvard fans:
In short, if Penn beats Yale and either Brown or Dartmouth loses on Friday, Harvard stays at the two seed heading into the tournament.
Things to look out for as Harvard as it hosts Cornell and Columbia?
Saturday is Senior Day for Zach Yoshor, Andre Chatfield, and team captain Chris Egi.
Both games this weekend will be tipping off at 7 p.m. at Lavietes Pavilion. It is the last opportunity for Cornell and Columbia to fight their way into the tournament as the fourth seed. Columbia has the tiebreaker in its favor given the Lions’ Feb. 2 victory against the Crimson, but all bets are off for who gets that coveted spot. It would take another FAQ in itself to explain the current No. 4 tiebreaker.

We’ve all been there: a gnarly surf of the Web ends in crashing waves, and a crashing browser. We open link after link in a new tab until the tabs are so tiny we have to squint to distinguish our Google Calendar from our Google Drive. We know that keeping so many tabs open inevitably overwhelms our senses and computers, but we can’t bring ourselves to quit. The question is, what do the open tabs on our computers say about us?
Confessions of an online shopaholic
10 tabs, 50 tabs, 100 tabs, let’s just not even discuss it. Clearly we have a problem with online splurging on clothes, shoes, dorm decorations, and ridiculous things like overpriced Muji pencils. Did you know you can order Crabby Patty Gummies on Amazon?
Facebook memes
Tagging all shameless procrastinators. Either we’re trying to get through an atrociously boring lecture, or to maintain friendships via daily meme tags—the tabs say it all.
Summer internships and programs
These tabs reek of desperation. The last-minute scramble to make summer arrangements is evidenced by tabs from program sites, email correspondences, the OCS website, and the dreaded “CARAT.”
Daily Mail articles
We’re just trying to take our education into our own hands...about pop culture, that is. Every now and then we go a bit overboard, and while the Daily Mail is mostly garbage, we simply can’t tear our eyes away from that day's new Kardashian-Jenner pap shots.
WebMD
For the self-proclaimed doctors among us. Whether we’re researching the symptoms of mono, herpes, or the measles (whichever hot new disease is infecting Harvard that week), the abundance of open WebMD tabs only add to our anxiety about dying from the common flu.
Buzzfeed quizzes
And down the rabbit hole we go! What will it be today? Are These Oreo Flavors Real or Made Up? What Steve Harvey Suit Are We? Or maybe, What Disney Love Song Should We Play at Our Wedding?
Speaking of, thanks for taking “What the Open Tabs on Your Computer Say About You.”
