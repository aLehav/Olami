After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A survey of 802 households revealed that parents are largely aware of the dangers and consequences that could arise from their children’s unregulated access to social media.
The survey, which was part of a study that culminated in a report entitled “Parents, Teens, and Online Privacy,” was conducted by researchers at the Pew Internet Project in collaboration with Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society.
“Most parents of teenagers are concerned about what their teenage children do online and how their behavior could be monitored by others,” the study reads. “Some parents are taking steps to observe, discuss, and check up on their children’s digital footprints.”
According to the study, most parents are concerned with the collection of web histories in order to create targeted advertising. Eighty-one percent of surveyed parents listed this as a concern, while 72 percent were worried about the potential for their children to interact with strangers online, and 69 percent were troubled by the possibility of their childrens’ online behavior negatively affecting their futures.
“Although parental anxiety over children’s technology use is nothing new, it was striking for us to see the degree to which concerns about advertisers’ data collection outweighed other concerns, such as interaction with strangers online,” said Mary Madden, one of the study’s authors.
In most of these categories, parents of younger teens of ages 12-13 were more concerned, especially with regard to interactions with strangers. Middle-income families showed more sensitivity to issues that could affect their child’s future opportunities, such as reputation, than did higher- or lower-income families.
Parents have taken a variety of steps to address their concerns about their children's online habits and behavior, including becoming more active online themselves. According to the study, 66 percent of parents of children ages 12-17 use a social networking site such as Facebook—up from 58 percent in a similar study conducted last year—and 80 percent of these parent users are “friends” with their children.
“We live in a quicksilver tech environment, and user behavior in the digital age is relatively fluid, too,” said Sandra Cortesi, one of the report’s authors and a fellow at the Berkman Center. “Actually, I would be surprised if the numbers would not change over time.”
In addition to increasing their online activity, concerned parents have employed different techniques such as educational discussions, privacy settings, or parental controls.
The paper is the first in what the researchers anticipate will be a collection of studies on youth privacy issues with the goal of gaining a broader understanding of teenage online behavior and helping inform government policy in an age where personal information is readily collected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard football team didn’t capture the Ivy League title, a number of players will be bringing home some hardware following the 2012 season.
After a season where Harvard couldn't meet preseason  expectations, finishing 5-2 in Ivy play and placing second in the  league, 10 Harvard players earned All-Ivy First Team nods, the league  announced Tuesday. While two players—sophomore defensive end Zach Hodges  and junior and recently elected captain Joshua Boyd—earned the accolade on the  defensive side, the Crimson earned two of the four spots on special teams, as  junior kicker David Mothander and senior punter Jacob Dombrowski were named to  the first team.
But the Crimson shined offensively—not surprising in a year when the team’s 394 points broke the modern-era Ivy League scoring record. In all, six of the 15 offensive players on the first team hailed from Cambridge. Two of the players—senior H-back Kyle Juszczyk and junior tight end Cam Brate—earned unanimous selections, while senior offensive linemen John Collins and Jack Holuba, Colton Chapple, and Treavor Scales also made the squad.
In all, six of the 10 Crimson first-team selections were seniors. Chapple’s selection over Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews, the 2011 Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year who led the league with 355.1 passing yards per game this season, cements Chapple’s status as the frontrunner for the award this season.
In addition to the 10 first-team selections, six Crimson players were named to the second team, and three earned All-Ivy honorable mentions, including captain Bobby Schneider, who missed the final four games of the 10-game season after breaking his arm in a 39-34 loss at Princeton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into Thanksgiving break, with The Game behind us and some of the more noteworthy spring sports—basketball, swimming, hockey, etc.—just beginning their seasons, The Back Page is taking a look back at the semester that was in some of Harvard’s major sports.
Football:
After winning the Ivy League title in 2011, Tim Murphy’s squad was expected to take the Ancient Eight crown again in 2012.
Through the squad’s first 23 quarters, that prediction looked to come true as the squad took a 34-10 lead into the fourth quarter at Princeton. After a series of blocked kicks, turnovers, and clutch play from Tiger quarterbacks that led to Princeton’s surprising 39-34 comeback victory, the Crimson looked to be down and out.
However, two Tigers losses to Cornell and Penn led to a winner-take-all contest in Philadelphia for the Ivy League title between Harvard and Penn. The Crimson dropped that game, 30-21, as the Quakers mustered over 200 yards against Harvard’s No. 2 ranked run defense in the FCS.
Although the Crimson rebounded to defeat Yale, 34-24, for the sixth straight time in The Game, the team underwhelmed despite various statistical accolades. The team had the best offense in the Ivy League and the second-best defense, with seniors quarterback Colton Chapple and running back Treavor Scales combining for 46 touchdowns and 4226 total yards of offense. Chapple eclipsed 350 yards through the air three times and amassed 448 yards with five touchdowns in the loss to Princeton.
On defense, the team mustered an FCS-best 78 sacks and shut down Cornell’s air attack—led by NFL prospect Jeff Mathews—that amassed over 440 yards against both Penn and Princeton. However, despite the two road losses, Harvard’s come-from-behind victory over Yale represented a fitting capstone to the tremendous final seasons of Scales and Chapple.
Men's Water Polo:
After bringing in a freshman class that accounted for 159 goals and 128 assists between them, the Harvard men’s water polo team notched its first nine-game winning streak since 2002 before qualifying for the CWPA Eastern Division Championships—a preseason goal of the squad. After losing to the first and second seeds earlier in the tournament, the Crimson took out third-seeded MIT in its final match of the year.
Freshman Ben Zepfel, who contributed 70 goals and 9 assists, was named to the CWPA Northern Division first team and thrice won Northern Division player of the week. The team loses only one senior next year—Antone Martinho—and with a youth-laden squad will have more experience under its belt as it tries to improve on its tournament performances.
Women's Volleyball:
For the fourth year in a row, the Harvard women’s volleyball team finished in the middle of the Ivy League pack, taking fifth place in the Ivy League with a 7-7 record and 26 sets for and 26 sets against.
The team bounced back from a seven-match losing streak early in the season to take six of the next eight contests and took two of its last three matches—including its final game to send its seniors out with a victory. It was the fourth time in a row the Crimson finished either fifth or sixth in the Ivy League.
In her senior season, Taylor Docter starred for Harvard. Docter, who was named to the All-Ivy first team, led the Crimson in kills and had a career-high 12 double-doubles while setting career highs in total digs and kills. She is the first player in eight years to be named to the All-Ivy League first team and ranks seventh all-time in Crimson history with 980 kills.
Men’s Golf:
In 2012, the Harvard men’s golf team got a new head coach in Kevin Rhoads. Rhoads, who previously only coached the women’s team, coached both this fall. After graduating two starters from last year in Mark Pollak '12 and Tony Grillo '12—who held the four highest single-season scoring averages in team history—the team filled the void with incoming freshmen Un Cho and Rohan Ramath.
The team improved throughout the season as it adjusted to fill the void, improving from a 14th-place finish at the Windon Memorial tournament to finish 5th at the MacDonald Cup, held at Yale, in its penultimate tournament of the fall semester.
Women’s Golf:
After a solid season in 2011 where then-sophomore Bonnie Hu won the Ivy League individual championship, the Harvard women’s golf team continued to improve the following fall. The group incorporated a new assistant coach in Claire Sheldon ’10, a captain of the team when she was a Harvard senior.
In a GoCrimson article, Rhoads called this team “the strongest yet for the Harvard women’s program” and the team backed up his comments by finishing with the highest ever national ranking in program history. They were No. 46 nationally and No. 12 in the East Region, both program records as the smaller team—five players were either injured or took leaves of absence during the school year—twice finished in the top five of the three tournaments it contested, finishing above No. 35 Texas in the other.
Women’s Soccer:
After winning the Ivy League championship in 2011, the women’s soccer team finished fourth in the Ancient Eight in 2012. While sophomore forward Meg Cascells-Hamby led the team with six goals, the team managed only one goal in back-to-back league losses to Dartmouth and Princeton.
The team held all but one of its last ten opponents to two goals or less and had solid defense all year, posting six shutouts—including in three of the final five games. The team will lose a senior class to graduation this fall that finished its career having notched 39 victories and two Ancient Eight titles during their time as Crimson.
Men’s Soccer:
Just three years removed from capturing the Ancient Eight championship, the men’s soccer team struggled for the second consecutive year under coach Carl Junot.
The team did not win a game in Ivy League play for the second straight year despite losing only one game all season against a team by more than two goals—against Connecticut in nonconference play. The team struggled in overtime with a 1-3-3 record, but did not give up more than three goals to any opponent but the Huskies.
In conference play, the Crimson took better shots—45 percent of its shots were on goal compared to 42 percent overall—and the team took more shots from outside in generating fourteen shots per game against competitors. Still, three members of the team were named to the All-Ivy first team, with co-captain Scott Prozeller making it outright and fellow co-captain Richard Smith and freshman Jake Freeman garnering honorable mention honors.
 
Field Hockey:
Harvard field hockey received a new coach in 2012, hiring Tjerk van Herwaarden in the offseason. The Crimson finished tied for last in the Ivy League in van Herwaarden’s first year, finishing 1-7 in League play.
The team lost a pair of one-goal decisions to close the year. Harvard had two players, co-captain Kim Goh and sophomore Caitlin Rea named to the second team All-Ivy unit. Goh finishes her career having appeared in every game the Crimson played over the four years. In her second year with the team, Rea led the group in scoring and her 47 shots (27 on goal) led the team. In the offseason, the team will need to replace co-captain goaltender Cynthia Tassopoulos, who is third all-time in Harvard saves with 540 for her career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long road stretch to open the season, the No. 7 Harvard women's hockey team (4-1-0, 4-0-0 ECAC) will return to action this weekend at the Bright Hockey Center to host two ECAC rivals.
On Friday night, the Crimson will face-off against Colgate (3-9-1, 0-5-1 ECAC) before sharing the ice with No. 2 Cornell (8-1-0, 6-0-0 ECAC) for a Saturday matinee.
The Crimson will be looking to bounce back from its first loss of the season after a slow start doomed Harvard to a 2-1 loss at the hands of No. 6/5 Boston University on Sunday.
“Coming away from the [BU game], we feel like we can do a better job putting in 60 minutes,” senior goaltender Laura Bellamy said after Sunday's game. “We feel like we had a good finish, but in the middle there we didn’t play as well.”
"We're looking forward to is the opportunity to have another game and to come out start-to-finish and play a full 60 minutes of Harvard hockey," co-captain Jillian Dempsey added Thursday.
Through five games, Harvard has allowed only three pucks between the posts, establishing a .60 goals against average that is second only to No. 1 Minnesota's mark of .57. Bellamy and freshman Emerance Maschmeyer have shared goaltending duties, stopping 84 shots on goal to establish a .966 save percentage. The Crimson has also posted a perfect 13-for-13 record on the penalty kill and is the least-penalized team in the NCAA.
On offense, Dempsey will have an opportunity to extend a 19-game individual point streak this weekend. The 2012 Patty Kazmaier Award nominee and ECAC first-team selection leads Harvard scorers with 1.2 goals per game and 2.2 points per game, marks that rank second and sixth in the NCAA, respectively.
"I honestly didn't realize that there was any kind of streak," Dempsey said. "I'm just trying to be as consistent as I can be and showing up every day and letting the team know what I'm going to bring each game."
Colgate, which finished 10th in the 12-team ECAC last year, will be looking for its first conference win on Friday. The Raiders will arrive at Bright battle-tested, having played Minnesota and Cornell each twice. The nation's top two teams took all four of those games, outscoring Colgate by a total of 36-2.
Harvard is 20-1-2 against the Raiders all-time and has shut out Colgate in its last three meetings. But after a weekend in which the men’s hockey team defeated Cornell but lost to Colgate, the Crimson women are not about to overlook their Friday night opponent.
"[The Raiders] are not that high in the standings, but that never means anything," Dempsey said. "Anything can happen on any given day, and I think a lot of opponents bring their A-game more when they're playing against Harvard."
Senior forward Brittany Phillips leads the Raiders in scoring with three goals and six assists.
The Big Red, meanwhile, is the Crimson's highest-ranked opponent of the season so far.
In this year's ECAC preseason poll, nine coaches tabbed Cornell as favorites to repeat as ECAC regular season champions. Harvard ranked second in the poll, receiving the remaining three first-place votes. Cornell swept its two games against the Crimson last year, shutting out Harvard, 2-0, in the teams' most recent meeting.
"[Cornell has] a lot of great depth and great talent, and it's always been very tough to beat them," Dempsey said. "But I think this year we're really close."
Harvard's defense will face its toughest test of the year in a Big Red offense that has averaged an NCAA third-best 4.67 goals per game this year.
Two-time Patty Kazmaier Award nominee and ECAC first-team selection Brianne Jenner leads a balanced Cornell attack with a 2.29 points per game average that ranks fourth in the NCAA. Jillian Saulnier, the 2012 ECAC Rookie of the Year, has also established herself as a prominent playmaker on the Big Red squad. Her 1.22 assists per game this season ranks sixth in the nation.
Harvard has not beaten Cornell since the 2008-09 season. After six losses and one tie versus Big Red over the course of their Crimson careers, Dempsey and Harvard's five other seniors have yet to break through against Cornell.
"It would be great to get the first win against [Cornell]," Dempsey said. "We know that we can compete with anybody. Yeah, they have great offense, and they have great defense too, but I think that we can really blow by them on the wall; and if we play well and move the puck the way we know how, then I think we have a good chance of winning."

This week marks the return of Black Friday: that day when Americans brave stampedes and sleep deprivation for the promise of steep discounts at their favorite stores. Boston is no different from the rest of America, with shops in Cambridgeside Galleria, Downtown Crossing, and Newbury Street all featuring late-night openings and discounts. But for those of you who aren't too keen on risking your life (and your grades) fighting for a chance to buy that new HDTV for your dorm room, Flyby has organized an alternative Black Friday agenda for you. The best part? You get to sleep in.
Zinnekin's - 1154 Massachusetts Avenue 
Start your day with breakfast from this Belgian waffle shop. They're offering 20 percent off on waffles and drinks. It should tide you over until you get your next Veritaffle fix.
The Havard Shop - The Holyoke Center or 52 JFK Street 
Your time at Harvard may allow for the easiest four years of holiday shopping you'll ever have: just get Crimson gear for everyone. With The Harvard Shop giving Harvard students a 25 percent discount all day Friday, it may also be the cheapest.
Faron Salon - 57 JFK Street 
Since formal season is fast approaching, you're going to want to look your best for the last few days of class. Take the opportunity to head over to Faron Salon for a mani/pedi or even a new hairdo. All of their services and products will be 25 percent off on Friday. You'll thank us when that dreamboat in your section finally asks you out. Just make sure to call ahead: they have limited appointments.
Black Ink- 5 Brattle Street 
Once you're well groomed, shopped, and fed you'll probably be wondering what to do with all of your savings. Unfortunately, Blanchard's doesn't have any Black Friday deals (we checked). If you go to Black Ink though, you can hide your shopping addiction behind a veil of altruism. The store is donating 10 percent of their total Black Friday sales to the New York Times Campaign to benefit those affected by Hurricane Sandy. It's the perfect solution to that empty spot on your bookshelf that's been begging to be filled with a piece of random kitsch.
