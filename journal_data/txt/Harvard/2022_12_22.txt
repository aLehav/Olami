After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once upon a time in the Cambridge of the ’80s, partners Michael Bronski and Walta Borawski lived happily in their shared apartment on Putnam Avenue, mere steps away from the nearest Harvard houses. Borawski was a poet and assistant to professor Ernst Mayr; Bronski was an esteemed writer and cultural critic.
Bronski and Borawski met at a New York City bath house in 1975 and remained partners until Borawski’s death from AIDS in 1994, establishing themselves as prominent artists and activists in the intervening years. Bronski, who is now Professor of the Practice in Media and Activism in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, taught a general education course this fall — Power to the People: Black Power, Radical Feminism, and Gay Liberation — that introduced students to many of the historical events and cultural shifts that he and Borawski helped spark.
Bronski and co-editor Philip Clark’s latest work, “Invisible History: The Collected Poems of Walta Borawski,” honors the legacy that his late partner left behind. Just as importantly, it elucidates the shared experiences of many adult gay men living through the beginnings of the gay liberation movement and the subsequent HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Released on Dec. 1, World AIDS Day, “Invisible History” is the first title published by Rebel Satori Press’s new imprint, Library of Homosexual Congress, which aims to preserve and promote “classic and provocative works of gay literature and nonfiction.”
Resurrecting these works, which Bronski dubs “lost AIDS literature,” is a critical element of honoring and respecting the realities of that era. At a time when Pride events and other festivities celebrate queerness in ways inaccessible to generations past, accurate representations of queer history must remain in the public consciousness.
“The definition of popular culture is that it fades away,” said Bronski in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “Bringing back Walta’s book [and similar works] … is an act of reclamation that’s really important.”
Queer popular culture can fade especially fast. Most cultural traditions and folk histories “are passed down through family lines,” Bronski said. “And gay men and lesbians largely do not follow that trajectory.”
“It’s largely an oral tradition,” and one that emerged shrouded in secrecy due to safety concerns, all of which creates a cultural imprint easily lost to the passage of time.
“The psychic complications of what it meant to be a gay man after Stonewall … at a time of this crazy world of sexual liberation in the ’80s … I do think even in the most narrow readership of people interested in gay men, gay life, or queer literature, it’s hard for younger people to understand what life was like back then because there’s so little written about it that they have access to,” Bronski said.
Works like Borawski’s fill in the blanks with authentic cultural mementos, salvaging the complexities of what it meant to be a gay man at that time. Bronski noted that the poems document a unique picture of the “gay male world of social activism” and pre-AIDS sexuality that few others write about.
The book’s final poem, entitled “[Michael I miss you so much],” paints an exceptionally clear picture of living with AIDS. Written in the final months of Borawski’s life, Bronski pointed out that the poem is followed by several scanned pages of his handwritten drafts. Words are scattered randomly across the page and written on top of one another in curved lines, a testament to his sound mind but weakened body.
The images are haunting. They represent the devastation of the AIDS crisis — and the immense purpose of reclaiming this lost literature — better than any present-day explanation ever could.
Prefacing the poem is a short note by Bronski, the final paragraph of which reads: “It is not a very good poem. It has none of [Borawski’s] elegance, his deep feeling for language, his humor, his irony, his anger, and his intelligence in it. But it is — purely and simply — a poem written from the vantage point of living with AIDS. It literally manifests his passion for writing. His desire to communicate, his need to express himself — no matter what — is quite simply visible in every line, word, scratch, mark, and scrawl.”
Also visible is the fullness of the suffering that AIDS did — and still does — inflict on so many people. Borawski’s poetry is notably raw and direct throughout the book, and these material remains of his creativity continue that legacy of showcasing the most paralyzingly vulnerable pieces of a human being.
Posthumously observing Borawski’s suffering at this time is especially powerful when recalling the widespread discrimination that gay men — and particularly gay men diagnosed with HIV/AIDS — faced throughout the AIDS crisis. “In the minds of many people, being homosexual was the disease and AIDS purely turned that psychological state into a medical reality,” Bronski explained. “Homosexuality was the disease… and now gay men were actually diseased.”
While harmful sentiments like this have lost traction in the U.S. in the decades since, remnants of this way of thinking are still felt today. Men who have sex with men, for example, still face restrictions on blood donation that advocates and medical experts describe as discriminatory; restrictions that persist in spite of recent, dire blood shortages.
Regardless, the efforts of Bronski and others to revive lost AIDS literature like Borawski’s are a crucial step forward for the queer community. The printed iterations of Borawski’s poetry not only reveal the chilling extent of the homophobia that gay men at the time endured, but also ensure that the true, unfiltered, complicated story of the gay liberation movement and the AIDS crisis — what so easily could have become an “invisible history” — remains permanently visible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When you’re talking to me, you’re really talking to yourself,” warns the protagonist’s friend in Bret Easton Ellis’s latest novel, “The Shards.” The novel truly feels like talking to oneself: It is a confession, a lie, a nightmare, and a paranoid diary. Set to release on Jan. 17, “The Shards” delves into what “really” happened to its semi-autobiographical narrator Bret Ellis and his friends when a serial killer started haunting Los Angeles in the early 1980s. But Bret is an unreliable narrator, and the “truth” is not always as simple as it may seem. “The Shards” toes the line between fear and truth, and Ellis uses an alluring and paranoid young version of himself as the protagonist to showcase the horror that arises from lying to both yourself and others.
Ellis has become a famous — and controversial — contemporary voice due to his popular novels “Less Than Zero” and “American Psycho.” “The Shards” feels like a natural culmination to Ellis’s work; while “Less Than Zero” languished in its numbness and “American Psycho” was electric bordering on nauseating, “The Shards” feels natural, as if Ellis has found his perfect niche. The novel is on the longer side, but its gripping pace makes the pages fly by.
In many ways, this novel presents itself as an autobiography: The main character is named Bret Ellis, and he lived and went to school in Los Angeles in the 1980s just as the true Ellis did. Throughout the novel, Ellis alludes to real events and even mentions writing his first novel, “Less Than Zero.” In the book’s forward, Ellis assures the reader that the book chronicles “those people I knew and the terrible things that befell us, including, most crucially, what had actually happened to me.” However, many narrative elements throw the reality of the novel into question. Firstly, Ellis wrote the piece with a “distance of forty years,” so the details are glossed over with the mist of memory. The book includes the deaths of multiple high-profile teenagers, and it is difficult to find proof that these crimes actually occurred in the ’80s. Ellis has written false narratives from the perspective of himself before, such as in his mock-memoir “Lunar Park.” The lines between reality, paranoia, and fantasy have always been blurred in Ellis’s work, but “The Shards” throws away any division between them.
While the truth of the novel is questionable, there is no doubt that this story grapples with very real issues. The novel deals with gruesome violence and paralyzing fear as well as everyday challenges like struggles with identity. Bret is gay and deeply attracted to his classmates, but feels trapped by the expectations of a teenage boy in the ’80s. He has a girlfriend, Debbie, but he feels as if he is playing a part and knows that he does not truly love her. Bret maintains this façade by numbing himself to the real world through drug use. Ellis captures the alienation of being different and the pain that comes with living a lie.
Yet the inner turmoil that Bret tries to stifle is revealed by the novel’s horrific external events. A shadowy serial killer called the Trawler haunts Los Angeles at the same time that a mysterious new kid named Robert Mallory arrives at school. As Bret begins to see connections between the Trawler and Robert, he is overwhelmed by paranoia and panic. Bret’s narrative is unreliable, since it is never confirmed whether or not his suspicions are real or imagined. Robert himself tells Bret that “You hear things that aren’t really there.” However, Ellis draws the reader into Bret’s paranoia, and his theories become not just plausible, but a matter of life and death.
The novel is gory, yet more subdued than some of Ellis’s past work. The violence is not gratuitous, instead showcasing the disillusionment of Los Angeles’s rich and powerful: Children are disappearing, and yet everyone is too numb to care. Bret is the only exception, and people start to believe that he is insane because he is worried. Bret’s paranoid obsession with the Trawler and Robert only further his self-isolation and disillusionment.
Above all else, “The Shards” is a horror novel, and it is set to scare readers in the best way possible. The plot is gripping and keeps one’s heart racing, and readers will be looking over their shoulders long after the book is closed. The novel makes readers start to question themselves and their assumptions as much as Bret questions reality. Bret Easton Ellis is at the top of his form here, and “The Shards” will not be a novel to miss in 2023.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview last Thursday that the College is committed to “transparency” in releasing admissions statistics.
Fitzsimmons said he believes it is important for applicants to apply to Harvard with an understanding of the College’s competitive admissions process, even as a number of peer institutions — including the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, and Princeton — have opted against sharing acceptance rates with the public in recent years.
The College has continued to reveal its perennially low acceptance figures, however, including a Class of 2027 early admissions acceptance rate that fell to 7.56 percent.
“We certainly believe in transparency and also just the idea that people would have a clearer sense of exactly what it is to apply to Harvard,” he said.
With the College facing a deluge of applications every year — including a record-breaking number of applicants to the Class of 2026 — Fitzsimmons said the admissions office aims to “encourage people who are realistic applicants.”
“We don’t want people, for their own sake, limiting themselves early,” Fitzsimmons said. “Maybe they’d be — they’re a little less competitive — better off applying early somewhere else and then taking a shot at a very competitive place.”
Fitzsimmons also discussed the following topics:
The Harvard College Class of 2026 faced a 7.9 percent early admissions rate and a record-low 3.2 percent regular decision rate, consistent with nationwide trends suggesting higher odds for acceptance in the early admissions cycle. Still, according to Fitzsimmons, applicants in both pools are held to the same standards.
“We make sure that as we admit people early that we’re 100 percent certain that these people would be admitted at the end of March,” Fitzsimmons said. “And that’s really the sole criteria.”
The College has also seen rising yield rates over the decades: 84 percent of the Class of 2026 opted to attend Harvard, up from 76 percent of the Class of 1996. Harvard’s yield figures are consistently above those of peer schools.
“It means that the admissions office has to be more and more careful in not sending out too many admits,” Fitzsimmons said.
Some admissions offices track a metric called “demonstrated interest,” which can include campus visits, emails with admissions officers, and social media interactions. All Ivy League institutions say they do not consider demonstrated interest in their admissions processes, though the factor can give applicants to some other schools a leg up.
Fitzsimmons said Harvard does not plan to track demonstrated interest, despite the challenges posed by rising yield rates to predicting class sizes, because it is “too variable.” Utilizing the waitlist would “in theory” be a better way to fill classes, according to Fitzsimmons.
“You’re better off leaving plenty of room as it were,” Fitzsimmons said. “We would love to admit 40, 50, 60 people off the waitlist every year. And that would be terrific.”
The College’s applicant pool has exploded in recent years, which Fitzsimmons attributed partially to the switch to test-optional admissions through the Class of 2030 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Class of 2026 faced the College’s largest ever applicant pool, with more than 61,000 students vying for a coveted slot. The Class of 2024, the last class required to submit test scores, was selected from an applicant pool of approximately 40,000.
Despite the change, Fitzsimmons says the admissions process has gone on “pretty much as expected.”
“We talked a lot — in fact, a lot publicly — about looking at the whole person, and people somehow think that if you don’t have test scores it’s very hard to evaluate an application, but you have teacher reports, you have grades,” he said. “There’s an enormous amount of academic information.”
Fitzsimmons called Zoom “an enormous help in recruiting” but added that it is not accessible for every applicant, noting that the admissions office is continuing efforts to reach students who may not have access to broadband internet, especially in rural areas.
“We read it in essays – people talk about how they had homework assignments, they had no internet access on the farm,” Fitzsimmons said.
While Fitzsimmons said the College is “making progress” in terms of recruiting, there are still challenges ahead, including expected volatility in the number of high school seniors in the United States.
“It goes down dramatically in 2026, goes up a little bit in 2032, but it goes way down after that essentially for the foreseeable future,” Fitzsimmons said.
Fitzsimmons also said Covid-19 has created a “knowledge gap” between students from high-income and low-income backgrounds due to inequities in educational opportunities during the pandemic.
The College aims to “double down” on recruitment messaging to students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, Fitzsimmons said.
“The power of recruiting tools today is much greater than it was even five or 10 years ago,” Fitzsimmons said. “I’m very optimistic, actually. But that isn’t to say that, especially in poor parts of the country and the world, that there aren’t huge challenges.”
Despite some challenges, Fitzsimmons said “the future looks exciting” for admissions.
Fitzsimmons has served as the College’s dean of admissions for 36 years and worked in admissions for five decades, but he said he has no plans to step down.
“I will live forever,” he joked.
