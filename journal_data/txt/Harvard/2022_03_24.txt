After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since he was 14 years old, Shivaike A. Shah has been involved in show business. The current Brown University visiting artist initially began his career in the arts as a cosmetic artist doing drag makeup for his friend. He has since added costumiere and producer to his list of backstage roles, most notably having produced a 2018 adaptation of “Medea” at Oxford University, where he graduated from in 2019.
“I’ve had a very varied career,” said Shah. “At Oxford I did 27 shows in makeup, costume, and some lighting design. I produced both theater and short films. Post leaving Oxford, I worked in fashion, theater, film, TV. I’ve worked for small theater companies, in the West End, at Marvel, for Netflix.”
Currently, Shah works as producer for the “Uprooting Medea” tour hosted by the Brown Arts Institute. Presented as a multimedia film and theater project and based on the 2018 production of “Medea” directed by Francesca Amewudah-Rivers, “Uprooting Medea” reimagines Euripides’ classic play through the cultural experiences of a contemporary, global-majority cast. During its four-month run visiting over 30 colleges in the U.S., the tour also includes script workshops with students and faculty and roundtable discussions centered around the themes of the production.
Shah founded Khameleon Productions in 2020 with the goal of celebrating diverse voices and perspectives within the art industry through collaborations with global-majority artists in theater, film, music, and poetry.
“[I’ve] had so many experiences backstage, certainly in fashion, where you may have managed to get diversity in front of the camera, but there’s nothing happening behind the camera,” Shah said. “I think that’s part of why Khameleon is so focused on what it means not just to have diverse characters on stage, but what it means to really change that dynamic backstage. My experience in and amidst so many kinds of productions and so many different roles is a key part of how I’m navigating and why I realized it was so important to navigate a company that really focused on changing that backstage environment.”
Creating spaces for artists of color in spaces that traditionally exclude or fail to include them recalls the themes of exclusion and attempted integration explored in “Uprooting Medea.” Medea is, after all, an immigrant who flees her native home in Colchis and follows her lover Jason to Corinth, a city hostile to foreigners and one in which Medea is determined to stay and make her new home.
“We’re very much looking at the idea of what it means to be in a space that you don’t necessarily belong, what it means to move home,” Shah said of Khameleon. “We’re interested in all those themes of just belonging, thinking about what it means to be in those spaces, what you carry with you from your past and what you’re looking for moving forward, but also the constraints that are put on you, and the situations that you are put in because of those ramifications.”
Another of Khameleon’s goals is to transform the way that global-majority stories are told. Often, they center around trauma — narratives that Khameleon’s artists believe are “vital” but also potentially limiting. According to Shah’s personal website: “Here at Khameleon, we want to celebrate our experiences and draw strength from our struggles, rather than just dwelling on them. Our productions will demonstrate how diverse groups coming together can, and will, overcome the systemic difficulties we face.”
What should audiences make of the fact that Medea, who kills her own children, is essentially a tragic figure in a tale of deep trauma? Shah admits that the premise of the play is not necessarily uplifting or celebratory — but that Medea herself, especially as an immigrant, is a compelling character “with whom we can explore themes of belonging, identity, broken promises, [and] home.”
He also cited the inclusion of commissioned works in the play, such as original compositions, movement, and spoken word pieces, as a way of enabling an open, collaborative environment. Artists can share their cultural experiences and identities in this space in order to counter the tension and trauma the characters in the play experience due to their identities.
“Letting people bring their own experiences and cultures, and pairing that with having those collaborative communities backstage…and then having them shared across different people at Khameleon is also a part of that process, even if the play itself is still founded in trauma. The environment and the way it’s worked is what's so important — it’s changing the environment that you put these artists in that I think is so key,” Shah said.
In addition to his work on “Uprooting Medea,” Shah is the creator and host of the “Khameleon Classics” podcast series, where he speaks with expert classicists to answer pressing questions about the field and examine how study of the Classics can inform and improve contemporary society.
Shah carries this familiarity with academia into both his role as visiting artist at Brown and during the “Uprooting Medea” tour, where he discusses the play with Classics students and professors. This engagement-focused aspect of the tour ensures that the project not only presents diverse, contemporary stories on stage, but also involves the audience and especially young people in rethinking and reimagining what a classic can be.
“I was starting to bridge the gap between the academy and the work we were doing,” Shah said. “Generally in classics classrooms…we’re thinking about what a classic is, thinking about what it means to make diverse theater, and thinking about how those two things intersect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard must reevaluate its undergraduate dining program. The College’s single, unlimited dining plan is restrictive, inflexible, and unreasonable — in terms of both organization and price. The pandemic has highlighted these shortcomings of undergraduate dining at Harvard, while at the same time presenting an opportunity to implement positive changes.
Of the 98 percent of undergraduate students who live on campus, all must subscribe to the $7,236 mandatory meal plan. In a standard school year, this amounts to a minimum of about $33.50 a day — students who get to school later or whose finals end earlier could end up paying more than $36. This dining program is nothing short of an exploitative monopoly. Because an off-campus community is lacking, freshmen are ordinarily required to live on campus, and social life is centered around the on-campus experience. Students have no choice but to pay.
The College says it requires the unlimited meal plan to foster a central community experience within each House. But community through dining can be nurtured without charging for 21 meals a week — especially since many students don’t sit for every meal in the dining hall anyways.
In the mornings, many students stop by only for a quick bite at breakfast or skip the meal altogether. According to Harvard University Dining Services, only 40 percent of students attend breakfast. Similarly, during lunchtime, returning to their own house isn’t possible for all students. Students with tight schedules and those who live in the Quad or in houses with shorter lunch windows might have no other choice than to eat out. And for dinner, students often want to catch up with friends. Even if they want to use a meal swipe, interhouse dining is restrictive, and some houses ban first-years entirely. The rigid dining plan can force bonding with friends outside your house to happen outside of campus altogether — and cost money.
Because Harvard operates what is effectively a monopoly on dining, there is little students can do to control their dining experience. Students have been left at the College’s often nonsensical whims during the pandemic. During the 2020 fall semester, when the per diem rate was as high as $42 because of reduced time on campus, dining halls operated with a limited menu. Hot food was not served until mid-October. Breakfast was served cold throughout the semester. Moreover, food could not be eaten in the dining hall, so many meals were taken in students’ suites (or worse, singles).
Besides the pandemic, other atypical situations have left many Harvard students hungry and out of home. Last fall, Adams House dining hall was closed for two weeks because of a fruit fly infestation.
There’s no saying what dining restrictions the future may hold, either. During the first two weeks of this semester, all dining halls were available only for grab-and-go as students traveled back to campus. New variants or other unexpected circumstances could send students back to grab-and-go meals, while restaurants around campus remain open.
Creating community is not a sufficient reason to require a universal, complete meal plan at today’s Harvard, where pandemic-related disruptions have laid bare the monopolistic nature of the College’s dining program. A more flexible plan, where students are given a required floor fee of 10 or so weekly meals, would allow students greater freedom while still encouraging bonding within their house or Annenberg, the freshman dining hall. Alternatively, if such a program proved too volatile, the College could offer those living on campus the same arrangement they do to off-campus students: a choice between plans of five, 10, or all 21 meals per week. Moreover, when students who receive financial aid eat out, they could be reimbursed at a rate tied to their level of aid and the cost of a meal swipe. Students of all financial backgrounds would then be free to choose when, where, and how their money would be spent.
While we should all be grateful for the hard work and enthusiasm of our HUDS employees, students should not be forced to either dine in their own houses or effectively pay a fee each time they venture outside their house to grab a meal with friends. The dining program is unnecessary to its goal of fostering community at Harvard and monopolistic in nature. It must go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My first exposure to Kwame Brathwaite’s work was in 2019 at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston as part of an exhibit titled “Icons of Style: A Century of Fashion Photography.” A black wall was printed with the words “Black Is Beautiful,” occupying the entire space from floor-to-ceiling. Before attending this exhibit, I had known nothing about the photographer, but the striking photographs (and the impact of the slogan I had heard hundreds of times before) prompted an ongoing interest in his work.
This past summer, I went to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas to see “Black Is Beautiful: The Photography of Kwame Brathwaite,” and I was incredibly moved by the glamour and depth of his work. The exhibit tells the story of Brathwaite’s illustrious career through his depictions of the Black art and jazz scene in Harlem. Images of Muhammad Ali, Nina Simone, Miles Davis, and countless others dress the walls. Though he photographed some of the most influential Black artists, musicians, and cultural figures of the 1950s and 1960s, and though he is credited with popularizing the phrase “Black is Beautiful,” Kwame Brathwaite remained largely unknown until the past decade. His work experienced a resurgence due to his own retellings of his life, in addition to the work of the brilliant Black cultural scholar Tanisha C. Ford, who wrote the catalog for the current “Black is Beautiful” traveling exhibit.
Brathwaite and his brother, Elombe Brath, founded the African Jazz Art Society and Studios in 1956. The organization was a collective of photographers, musicians, fashion designers, dancers, artists, and writers that centered its values around Pan-African politics. This group would lead to the start of Brathwaite’s photography career. He later worked with members of AJASS to found Grandassa Models, a group of diverse Black women models who aimed to both contest the images of white models featured in mainstream U.S. publications, and also to contest the exclusion of dark-skinned, natural-haired models in Black-owned publications like Ebony Magazine as well.
AJASS and the Grandassa Models produced a series of fashion shows, the first of which was titled “Naturally ’62: The Original African Coiffure and Fashion Extravaganza Designed to Restore Our Racial Pride and Standards.” In addition to celebrating Black women’s beauty, the Grandassa Models also hoped to change Black American perceptions of Africa as being primitive by wearing African and African-inspired clothes and hairstyles that demonstrated Africa’s vibrance and cosmopolitanism. While most of Brathwaite’s earlier photographs had been in black-and-white, he decided to shoot some of the Naturally shows in color to better display the range of shades of Black skin and the vibrant colors of the garments.
Brathwaite’s work is an indispensable visual contribution to the “Black is Beautiful” ideology. His images and his work with AJASS and Grandassa produced a shift in mainstream perceptions of what constitutes Blackness. More Black women began to embrace natural hair as a result of his artistic advocacy and his undeniably beautiful portraits of natural-haired Black women. His vision led to increased diversity of models in Black publications, and eventually in mainstream U.S. and global publications as well. As an avid consumer of fashion magazines, the diversity in beauty that I see (in part due to Brathwaite’s advocacy) is incredibly impactful. Seeing people like myself represented in glossy pages reminds me of my own beauty, and it builds a relationship between myself and the media I consume.
One of my favorite images of Brathwaite’s is part of a past exhibit called “Changing Times” at the Phillip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles. In the photograph, a Black woman with an afro is placed against a black-gray background, in sharp relief against the diffuse light that illuminates her face. She is twisted so that her back faces the camera, and we see her face at an angle. There are flecks of gold glitter that seem to be emanating from her figure, and she leans into herself, eyes closed, lips parted, head slightly back, and she seems to be ascending—to where, we’re unsure. This image, to me, so clearly displays the magical empowerment that comes along with the ability to recognize the inherent beauty and power we all hold.
The woman in the image seems to be in her own elegant, soft, world, untroubled by the world’s piercing eyes.

The Harvard Undergraduate Council was originally established, as many things are at Harvard, through a committee process approved by the administration and instituted through faculty legislation in 1982. While a referendum was held for students to vote on the UC’s creation, it was bankrolled by an administration-funded publicity drive. In the 40 years since then, it has achieved progress in some areas. In recent years, however, the UC has been the source of more grief and embarrassment than school pride.
Frustrations with the system have been widely felt throughout the student body, with only 17 percent of Harvard seniors approving of their UC President and Vice-President in 2021. These frustrations are enhanced by the fact that the UC is funded by part of the $200 student activities fee undergraduates pay each year. The UC has also faced financial scrutiny; Risk Management and Audit Services have been called in to conduct a thorough investigation of the organization’s methods and monetary decisions after an overwhelmingly large amount of financial allegations during the previous UC election. Though there have been a few victories over the years, overall the UC has failed the student body. Its flawed, inherently confrontational structure — one previously created by administrators — has made it difficult for the UC to organize students and make long-lasting change. Generating sustainable solutions is not a core aspect of the current, and outdated, UC model.
But students are not complacent – they want an improved system. That is one of the reasons they gave the UC a “vote of no confidence” and elected the current president and vice-president in last November’s UC presidential election. It was from this same desire for change that a group of students assembled to write a new constitution.
This group of students were tasked with one key question: if we were to create an inclusive, open, and effective student government at Harvard today, what would it look like? Twice a week for several months, these students — first-years and upperclassmen, international and domestic students, athletes and non-athletes, and students from a diverse array cultural backgrounds — debated and discussed topics ranging from the high-level goals of a body to the nitty gritty details of club financing and elections. Talking with students, UC members, professors, and other organizations around Harvard’s campus, they created an innovative new system for student advocacy: the Harvard Undergraduate Association.
The HUA constitution is modeled after highly successful student associations worldwide, specifically the University of Sheffield’s that has an approval rating of over 90 percent. Rather than electing all of its members, membership of the HUA would be open to anyone who would like to join. This larger body of members would then be organized into teams — such as academics, residential life, or well-being — that focus on tackling key issues at Harvard. Annual school-wide elections would be used to determine the officers who would lead each of these teams, and two co-presidents who would ensure the student association continues to represent students’ needs. Electing officers for a particular team would lead to campaigns that are both policy-focused and practically more achievable. Tools such as referenda, sortition, and digital democracy would be used to ensure accountability and democratic legitimacy when the HUA would make policy decisions.
The HUA would take direct action as a student advocacy group. Students who care about issues would be able to meet with administrators through the HUA’s connections, allowing for the new student association to give a platform to more students, rather than the current structure of speaking for those who can speak for themselves. The new structure would allow any student to partake in the student association’s work in an open, transparent, and student-centric model. The HUA is designed to promote student body participation — this would make strong and successful advocacy possible. Volunteer participation would also be a constant litmus test of the efficacy of the organization, aiming to bolster legitimacy and have a group that truly represents the student body’s voice.
If this new constitution is ratified, the HUA will immediately launch specific measures that are in alignment with its values. Students will be partially refunded with the current withheld UC funds. Club applications and funding will be streamlined and more flexible, allowing for clubs to start during different times of the academic year and funding processes to be tailored to clubs’ needs. Also, by integrating specific teams into the structure of the HUA, a multitude of issues can get deserving attention, unlike the current model that pushes different issues to the back for the sake of parliamentary procedures.
Harvard is one of the premier institutions of higher learning in the world. Why shouldn’t our student association represent the caliber of students we have? As a volunteer-driven student association, the HUA will differ from the UC with the student body’s direct participation, becoming the first student association at Harvard created entirely by students for students. We support the new constitution and a dissolution of the fragmented and outdated UC.

UPDATED: March 24, 2022 at 12 a.m.
Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 said Wednesday she would recuse herself from a case challenging affirmative action at Harvard if she is confirmed to the bench before the court takes it up this fall.
Jackson, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, will complete a six-year term on the Harvard Board of Overseers in the spring. Questioned about the potential conflict of interest on Wednesday, she said she would recuse herself from the marquee affirmative action case justices are set to hear in the fall challenging Harvard College’s race-conscious admissions policies.
“If you’re confirmed, do you intend to recuse [yourself] from this lawsuit?” Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) asked.
“That is my plan, senator,” Jackson said.
In January, the Supreme Court agreed to take up a pair of lawsuits challenging race-conscious admissions processes at Harvard and the University of North Carolina that could determine the fate of affirmative action policies in American higher education.
Jackson’s exchange with Cruz — which came during the third day of her marathon confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee — marked the first time she has publicly pledged to recuse herself from the case if confirmed.
Experts are split over whether Jackson’s role on the board would warrant a recusal, with some saying her ties to Harvard — as a member of the Board of Overseers, an alumna, and a parent with a daughter in the College’s Class of 2026 — create a conflict of interest. Others argue that because she did not craft Harvard’s admissions policies, she would not have to recuse herself.
As a lower court judge, Jackson recused herself in two other cases due to her role on Harvard’s governing board.
New York University Law Professor Stephen Gillers said he was “surprised” by Jackson’s announcement. She likely felt the public would doubt her impartiality in the case, he said.
Gabe Roth, executive director of watchdog group Fix the Court, said he was surprised by how swiftly the matter was dealt with in the hearing. He added that she made “the right call” in pledging not to rule on the case.
“It tamps down any speculation,” he said. “It’s one thing that’s not hanging over her head and isn’t hanging out there in terms of more questions and news stories.”
Stetson Law professor Louis J. Virelli III said the issue displayed “the heightened role that recusal is playing in the selection process.”
“It’s evidence that recusal is here to stay as an issue in at least public perception of the court and its conduct,” Virelli said.
Experts agreed Jackson’s recusal is likely to have little impact on the outcome of the case, given the court’s six-justice conservative majority. If confirmed, Jackson would replace Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who was appointed in 1994 by President Bill Clinton.
The court will hear the Harvard lawsuit, brought by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, jointly alongside a similar suit filed against UNC. During Wednesday’s hearing, Jackson did not specify whether she would rule on the UNC case.
“Any conflicts of interest present in the Harvard case are not present in the North Carolina case,” Virelli said.
Harvard Law School professor Noah R. Feldman said the court will likely decide the cases separately so Jackson can participate in the UNC case.
“Ordinarily, the justices will go to efforts to enable justices to participate in cases that they are permitted to participate in,” he said. “These cases were separately litigated, and there’s no need to join them. It’s up to the discretion of the court to decide whether cases are going to be joined or not joined.”
“If it did not happen, that would be an unprecedented example of a lack of collegiality,” Feldman added.

Following her recent campaign for Governor of Massachusetts, Harvard Government professor Danielle S. Allen is set to return to as director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics for the 2022-2023 academic year.
Allen looked back on her run for office and discussed her future at Harvard in an interview Wednesday, five weeks after suspending her campaign. She had stepped back from her roles on campus during the race to maintain a separation between her political work and the University.
“It really meant I was sort of out of touch with people, and so it's a real pleasure to reconnect and just honestly spend time hearing what people have been up to for the past year,” Allen said.
Allen said she is guided by her “life’s purpose” of furthering American democracy and saw running for office as the way to do so.
“Across all my areas of work, you’ll see me doing the same thing,” she said. “You’ll see me working on democracy in scholarly terms, you’ll see me working on housing, you’ll see me working on justice reform, you’ll see me working on civic education.”
However, asked whether she would seek political office again in the future, she said she will assess the direction her career must take as the needs of the nation’s democracy change.
“There’s a lot of work to do, and over time, I will be reconfiguring my portfolio to get that work done, depending on opportunities and depending on necessities,” she said.
Asked about her bid for the Commonwealth’s highest office, Allen was pragmatic about the need for an early end to the campaign.
“The simple fact of the matter is that in the early parts of the caucus process, we did not succeed in hitting our targets,” Allen said. “And the math was just such that there was not a path to continue pursuing.”
She said Massachusetts “has room for improvement,” reiterating her previous claims that the state’s primary system shuts out non-traditional candidates.
“As it happens, we have the most restrictive ballot access process in the country,” she said. “And it’s time for us to see that and say that and figure out how we can live up to our own standards for an inclusive 21st century democracy.”
Even as she leaves politics and returns to academia, Allen said she will continue working on the same issues she did as a candidate, only from a different angle. She said she sees her role at the Safra Center as another way to help improve the health of American democracy.
“We’re very proud of the work that we do at the Safra Center, making sure that questions of ethics are at the table for every kind of policy making conversation,” she said.
As she comes back to Harvard, Allen already has a plan for the shape her work will take. Aside from her work with the Safra Center, she will teach a class at the Harvard Kennedy School next spring titled “Justice By The Means of Democracy” — a phrase she consistently used in the interview to describe her life’s purpose.
“There's a heck of a lot of work to do helping people really sort of deeply understand what it means to put questions of ethics and core values — human dignity — at the center of policymaking,” she said.
Correction: March 24, 2022
A previous version of this article misquoted Danielle S. Allen. She said she has spent time “hearing what people have been up to for the past year.” She did not say she has spent time “hearing what people have been up to for the past few years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 25, 2022 at 2:06 p.m.
The Coalition for a Just Allston and Brighton, a group of Allston-Brighton residents and non-profit organizations, led a protest condemning Harvard’s expansion plans in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood earlier this month.
Boston City Councilor Elizabeth A. “Liz” Breadon and Massachusetts State Representatives Michael J. Moran and Kevin G. Honan attended the demonstration, which came amid heightened tensions between Allston-Brighton residents and Harvard regarding the University’s development plans across the river.
Shortly before, Harvard and CJAB each penned a letter to recently-elected Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 painting starkly different pictures of the University’s expansion.
The current state of Harvard’s relationship with Allston is the culmination of a long and complex history. In the late 1980s, Harvard began expanding its Allston campus, acquiring 52.6 acres of land in eight years through anonymous purchases made by the Beal Companies. In a letter to then-Harvard President Neil Rudestine, Boston's mayor at the time, Thomas M. Menino, called Harvard’s acquisition strategy “the highest level of arrogance seen in our city in many years.'”
As of this year, Harvard and its subsidiaries own roughly one third of the land in Allston. The wave of development includes the recently-completed $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex, more than two dozen properties on or around Western Avenue, and the proposed Enterprise Research Campus, which has been the subject of growing criticisms by Allston residents.
Developed by Tishman Speyer, the ERC, if approved, would be home to a hotel and conference center, a restaurant, housing units, public open space, retail use, and research-focused office and lab space.
On Feb. 23, University Vice President Katherine N. Lapp sent a six-page letter to Wu, Breadon, Moran, Honan, and the Harvard-Allston Task Force, detailing Harvard and Tishman Speyer’s commitment to the Allston-Brighton neighborhood through the ERC.
“Harvard’s long-term goal for the ERC and the Beacon Park Yard is to transform these obsolete and largely impermeable industrial properties into new, vibrant, equitable and welcoming districts that will complement and enrich the Allston-Brighton community,” Lapp wrote.
She went on to enumerate a set of University commitments to engage Allston residents and provide open space, affordable housing, workforce development, and transportation through the ERC development.
CJAB’s own letter to Wu — a 19-page manifesto outlining a set of demands for Harvard’s developments in Allston — calls on the University to better fulfill such promises.
“[CJAB] fears the replication of the Seaport in Allston-Brighton, with all its attendant issues — unaffordable, exclusionary housing; lack of opportunity for local business; horrendous traffic congestion; and lack of resilience in the face of our ongoing climate crisis,” the letter reads. “We fear that Harvard will perpetuate Boston’s existing economic and racial segregation in the construction of this new neighborhood.”
A major point of contention between the two letters is the University’s provision of affordable housing and greenspace in its developments.
In the letter, Lapp affirms Harvard’s commitment to ensure that 20 percent of ERC housing units be income-restricted. Meanwhile, the CJAB letter calls on Harvard to guarantee that 33 percent of the housing units in its Allston-Brighton residential developments be income-restricted.
Harvard’s letter also maintains that the ERC will include “parks, plazas, greenways and streetscapes” and commits 20 percent of the total developable land area to publicly accessible open space. The letter boasts the ERC’s proposed “Greenway,” a large area of open space leading through the ERC to the Charles River.
But the CJAB letter urges Harvard to grant the “permanent easement of rights” of the ERC’s Greenway to the City of Boston, which would ensure that the greenspace will not be built upon in the future. In a footnote in her letter, Lapp said the imposition of easements would be “unnecessary” and “extremely burdensome.”
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the Boston Mayor’s Office affirmed Wu’s commitment to engaging and protecting the interests of Allston residents.
“Mayor Wu is committed to listening to and incorporating the input of community members into current and future projects, to ensure development in the Allston area helps build a successful urban neighborhood for people who call the Allston community home,” the statement reads.
Roughly 150 people attended CJAB’s March 15 rally, including representatives from 34 organizations, according to Breadon, who said she was “very encouraged” by the movement.
“I really feel we're sending a message to Harvard that it's really important that they engage with the community and the co-creators of a resilient, inclusive and equitable neighborhood,” Breadon said.
Kevin M. Carragee, an organizer for CJAB, said Harvard’s expansion has implications for affordable housing in the neighborhood.
“The housing crisis in the city of Boston is influenced by a whole set of actors, very complex actors,” Carragee said. “But does Harvard play a contributing role to the housing crisis in the city and in this neighborhood? The answer is yes: by its expansive purchases of land, by its land banking, and by its failure to house more of its graduate students.”
“The coalition has no problem with the ERC being transformative for Harvard and Tishman,” he added. “We have a problem that their proposal right now is not transformative for the Allston-Brighton community.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the school is “grateful” for feedback from Allston-Brighton residents and elected officials, reiterating Harvard’s pledges to the neighborhood.
“As noted in the letter from February 23, we’re proud to have refined and extended our commitments in planning, zoning, and community needs, as well as significant contributions to affordable housing and homeownership; sustainability, resilience, and open space; mobility and transportation; and in workforce development focused on jobs for residents, particularly in emerging life science and technology fields,” she wrote.
But Carragee argued that Harvard’s development model contradicts its “social justice mission.”
“I've read President Bacow’s evocative speeches and statements and other Harvard administrators’ about the social justice mission of Harvard and how Harvard takes it so seriously. The coalition takes it seriously, too. Live up to the standard that you defined, not that we're assigning to you,” he said. “Words matter. Commitments matter.”
“The Harvard administration should know that we’re willing to run a marathon on this,” he added. “And we’re in shape to do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department closed its investigation into a racist attack against Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 that took place in Quincy House last month.
After two signs calling Cheng a racist anti-Asian slur and bearing the phrase “SAVE THE UC” were discovered on Cheng’s door, HUPD began investigating the incident as a “bias-related suspicious act.”
In a pair of emails to The Crimson Wednesday, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano confirmed the investigation had concluded. He did not disclose if a perpetrator had been identified.
“The investigation is closed,” Catalano wrote. Asked for clarification on the results of the inquiry, he wrote, “It was closed at the conclusion of the investigation.”
Overwhelming support for Cheng poured in following the attack last month. Quincy House Faculty Deans Eric Beerbohm and Leslie J. Duhaylongsod penned a statement of support, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Women’s Association authored a letter of solidarity, which was co-signed by 24 student groups.
Cheng was elected UC president in November following a campaign that promised to “defund” the body and rewrite its constitution. His inauguration, and several UC meetings since, have been marred by conflict.
In a UC meeting the week of the attack, Cheng rejected a statement of solidarity by the Council, calling it hypocritical. Cheng speculated that the perpetrator was a UC member.
In a statement Wednesday, Cheng expressed his gratitude to HUPD investigators.
“I really appreciate the professionalism, dedication, and attention to detail of Captain Negron and Detective Surette,” Cheng wrote. “The fact that Captain Negron and Detective Surette spent weeks tirelessly searching for the truth, which still is our highest aspiration at our university, reinforces my faith in humanity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 24, 2022 at 2:16 p.m.
A panel of philanthropic leaders discussed efforts to promote racial justice in philanthropy at a virtual event hosted Wednesday by the Harvard Institute of Politics.
The panel — titled “Advancing Racial Justice in Philanthropy: Aspiration or Reality?” — featured Libra Foundation Executive Director Crystal Hayling, Solidaire Network Executive Director Rajasvini Bhansali, and Borealis Philanthropy President Amoretta Morris. The event  was co-hosted by the Institutional Antiracism and Accountability Project.
The panelists discussed the importance of philanthropy and called for change to promote equity.
Bhansali, an advocate for grassroot-led social movements, said marginalized groups are often shut out of mainstream philanthropy.
“When people of color, women of color, gender non-conforming people start to lead, there is a big dangerous feeling of like, the structure has shifted,” Bhansali said.
“In philanthropy now…communities are treated as proxies, as subcontractors, as ones that are going to enact our boardroom wisdom to some kind of strategy that helps us check a box,” she added.
Hayling said philanthropy is an important mechanism for change.
“It is organizing money to move it, to organize people,” she said. “Because ultimately, those are the folks that are going to beat the corporate money, the accumulated wealth, the exploitative wealth that’s in our communities.”
She added it is important to “generate joy as we do work” to avoid burnout.
“I kind of came into this work with the belief that social change work was about pushing through and grinding harder,” Hayling said. “And I’ve been taught by people in movement that that won’t work. That leads to burnout, and that leads to bitterness, and it leads to fighting.”
In an interview after the event, Morris said higher education institutions have a responsibility “to equip people with the skills to be antiracist actors.”
“When I think about what the responsibility is for the higher education institutions, I am thinking about the responsibility to equip every single student with the skills to understand how structural racism shows up in our society, in our communities, in policies, and in institutions,” she said.
“I absolutely believe that change is possible in this sector,” she added of philanthropy. “And I absolutely believe that change is possible in the world.”
In an interview, Morris offered an optimistic view of the future of philanthropy.
“As long as we are connected and in community, and not feeling like the change can be made alone or by ourselves, but that the power of movement—the power of transformation—comes in community, and it comes when we’re working together,” she said. “So my advice to people is to join an organization, get to work, and stay hopeful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will commence renovations on its historic Weld and Newell Boathouses this year in what is planned to be the most significant update to the buildings since their construction more than a century ago.
The University announced its plans for the project in the February release of its 2021 Town Gown report, which details the University’s sustainability, diversity, and infrastructure goals. The report revealed the renewal project would include extensive interior and exterior improvements, as well as new sustainability features.
Senior Associate Athletics Director Timothy P. “Tim” Troville said the renovations to the Weld Boathouse, which houses the women’s teams, are expected to begin around June 1 and conclude by January. Renovations on Newell, home to the men’s crew teams, will start in September and are expected to finish by November 2023.
Troville said the renovating team is planning to build energy-efficient air conditioning systems that use natural wind currents from the Charles River and install solar panels during upgrades to the buildings’ roofs. The renovations will also include an upgrade to LED lighting, among other changes.
“Planned work, which is expected to commence later this year, includes interior renovations for new training facilities, locker rooms and bathrooms, significant interior and exterior accessibility improvements, the replacement of the terracotta roof tiles, masonry cleaning and repair, storm drainage improvements, and replacement of the existing ramps and docks which have reached the end of their useful life,” Harvard spokesperson Amy Kamosa wrote in an email.
Plans for the renovations started in 2013 and went through several revisions following feedback from the Athletics department, alumni, and coaches, Troville said. The project was brought to the Harvard Corporation for approval after a fundraising initiative collected the necessary funds to complete the updates.
Liz O’Leary, head coach of the women’s heavyweight crew team, attributed the success of the fundraising efforts to philanthropy from alumni, parents, and friends of Harvard and Radcliffe rowing.
“It’s been recognized that both the boathouses, Newell and Weld, need love and attention,” she said.
Troville added that the pandemic caused “minor delays” but ultimately allowed the timeframe of the construction projects to “tighten up” from two calendar years to 18 months.
He admitted the rowing teams will be “slightly inconvenienced” by the projects. During construction, the teams will have to rely on temporary docks and available parts of the boathouses.
“There’ll be some minor changes,” Troville said. “But I think it’ll be short in duration.”
He reassured that the boathouses will “maintain the charm and character” of their current appearance with the addition of new amenities, such as hot water in their showers and functional plumbing.
“The University’s renewal of the Weld and Newell Boathouses will address much needed repair and restoration of these historic and iconic buildings,” Kamosa wrote. “Both projects are being carefully planned to ensure that Harvard’s rowing programs have uninterrupted water access during construction, and renewed facilities will enable equitable usage.”
O’Leary said her team would “find another home” while the boathouses undergo renovations. She was optimistic that the team would adapt to any disruptions caused by the construction.
“You turn it into a positive, and you think about how you’re going on a little adventure here — we’re going to go row out of a different boathouse,” O’Leary said. “Things will be different, but that’s okay.”
Troville said the Athletics department is eager to renovate the iconic, century-old boathouses.
“I think when you think of springtime, you think of the crew boats rowing on the Charles,” he said. “And so we’re very excited to be able to renovate these buildings and make sure that they last another 75 to 100 years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mere days after upsetting No. 6 Quinnipiac in the ECAC Tournament championship game, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team is set to take on an even tougher challenge in the Albany Regional’s No. 1 seed Minnesota State Mavericks. The game will be played at 12 pm on March 24 at MVP Arena in Albany, N.Y, and it will be the first-ever meeting between the two programs.
“We have a really talented team. We can get up and down the ice with anybody,” claimed head coach Ted Donato ’91. “We have some really good players that can play against anybody, they've shown that on the world stage…We're not going in thinking that we have to pull a rabbit out of our hands. We're gonna go in and put our best game forward and go in and try to earn a victory.”
“It started even before this weekend- the resiliency of this group and the calmness under pressure when we do go down a goal or something happens that isn't in our favor and we kind of have to fight through that to get a few more goals than we thought we needed,” added senior forward and captain Casey Dornbach. “This has been the tightest knit group and the best group that I’ve been a part of since being here at Harvard. We have a lot of guys that want to get better, that want to do something special.”
The Mavericks, members of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), spent the majority of the regular season on top of the NCAA rankings before being supplanted by the Michigan Wolverines in the NCAA tournament seeding. After finishing the regular season with a 35-5-0 record, Minnesota State defeated the St. Thomas Tommies, the Northern Michigan Wildcats, and then the Bemidji State Beavers to win the Mason Cup, the CCHA’s postseason championship. The Mavericks are elite on both ends of the ice, ranking second in the nation with 4.17 goals per game and 1.27 goals-against per game.
Leading the Mavericks on the ice are forward Nathan Smith and goaltender Dryden McKay, both finalists for the 2022 Hobey Baker Award, which is given to the top player in college hockey. Smith, a prospect for the National Hockey League (NHL)’s Arizona Coyotes, has recorded 49 points (18 goals, 31 assists) in 34 games played this season, which is second in the country behind University of Denver forward Bobby Brink. McKay, a two-time All-American and previous Hobey Baker finalist, has recorded a 1.27 goals-against average and .934 save percentage, both of which are in the top five nationally.
Despite playing in the CCHA, a weaker conference where only two other teams had winning records, the Mavericks recorded several wins against top competition, defeating then-No.1 ranked University of Massachusetts-Amherst in October, while splitting a series with then-No.2 ranked St. Cloud State later that month. Minnesota State also defeated then-No. 10 Providence before losing to then-No.3 Michigan.
“We know they’re an older team and they [have] a lot of offense too so we’re going to have to be firing on all cylinders,” Minnesota native Dornbach claimed. “Being that it's a team from Minnesota, [I] kind of know a little bit about some of their players, they got some good players, but we do too and I think it will be a great matchup.”
“They're an older, more experienced team with really strong [defensive]-core, they get some top scores up front, they have two lines that do a lot of scoring,” Donato noted. “They're one of the top teams in the country, offensively. They're one of the top teams in the country, defensively. So they pose a lot of challenges. And, you know, for us, you know, we'll have to be at our best.”
The Crimson enter the NCAA tournament on a 12-2-2 run, which began with a late January road trip to Colgate and Cornell in upstate New York. Despite finishing in a disappointing tie for third place at the 2022 Beanpot Tournament, Harvard went on a strong run through the ECAC tournament, defeating RPI two games to one in a dramatic series before beating Clarkson 5-3 in the semifinals and upsetting Quinnipiac 3-2 in overtime in the championship. The 2022 tournament is the Crimson’s seventh appearance under the leadership of Donato, who has coached the team since the 2004-2005 season.
Leading the Crimson in scoring is first-year forward Matthew Coronato, a prospect of the Calgary Flames and a member of Team USA at the 2021 World Junior Championships, who has recorded 35 points (18 goals, 17 assists) in his first season in Cambridge. Coronato also scored the game-winning goal in overtime to defeat Quinnipiac in the ECAC Tournament championship game on Saturday night. Right behind Coronato in scoring are junior forward and captain Nick Abruzzese, a Toronto Maple Leafs prospect and U.S. Olympian, who has recorded 32 points (9 goals, 23 assists), and junior defenseman Henry Thrun, an Anaheim Ducks prospect who has tallied 32 points (7 goals, 25 assists) this season.
In net, Harvard is backstopped by junior goaltender Mitchell Gibson, who has recorded a 2.10 goals-against average and a .919 save percentage this season. Gibson was particularly strong in the ECAC championship, making a career-high 47 saves on 49 shots to keep the Crimson alive in a game where they were outshot 49-17.
“Mitch is an amazing goalie who is only getting better. He’s heating up and had some huge games for us, this weekend being huge for him and huge for us,” reflected Dornbach on Gibson’s championship-winning performance. “We’re gonna need him back there and we have full trust in him to do just that.”
As a team, Harvard averages 3.32 goals per game while allowing 2.29, both of which are 11th in the country.
“We certainly recognize that we [have] some real talent, we [have] some real character, and we [have] really good players…Quite frankly, we just haven't played that many games together as a group, not only kind of in entirety, but even specifically just, you know, this year,” Donato said. “We had, I think, 17 guys go through Covid in like a three week period…We still have our best hockey ahead of us, and I think we're starting to hit that stride. We find ways to win.”
The game will be streamed on ESPNU at noon on Thursday. Updates will also be posted on Twitter by @THCSports, as well as the team’s account @HarvardMHockey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten games, nine days, two coasts, and one Ivy League rivalry later, Harvard softball had a whirlwind of a spring break.
Jetting off to California to start a non-stop onslaught of competition, Harvard (8-11, 2-1 Ivy) competed in the UCR/CBU Classic against the University of North Dakota (10-22), California Baptist University (18-16), and Saint Mary’s College (11-10).
Opening with a double header at John C. Funk Stadium on March 11th, the Crimson prevailed against the University of North Dakota with a 3-0 win, but later fell 4-3 to California Baptist University.
Harvard’s pitching squad was essential for the early win, with sophomore pitcher Anna Reed earning her and Harvard’s first shutout of the season in the 3-0 win over the Fighting Hawks. Her standout performance earned the team another accolade in the league, as she was recognized as the Ivy League Pitcher of the Week.
“It felt good,” Reed said. ”I wanted to go in and play how I know I can play.”
Coming off from a challenge set of games in Alabama the week prior, Reed returned with a vengeance to the mound, and credited Harvard’s strong defense to her success.
“Our defense is really amazing,” Reed commented. “They’re a lot of fun to have behind me and I know they’re going to get it done.”
Along with a strong defensive showing, Harvard’s offense was quick to attack against California Baptist, with junior centerfielder/utility Megan Welsh scoring her first home run of the season to open scoring for the Crimson.
“Once the opportunity strikes for some offense to step in, and somebody gets a clutch hit or some smart base running happens, then we're able to pull through and get some wins,''  Welsh commented. “Definitely was a big job for our pitchers, and they really stepped up their full ability.”
Harvard ended the UCR/CBU Classic in a pair of games against Saint Mary’s, winning the first game on a ground out 3-2. Harvard’s offensive attack was thwarted in the second game, however, and the Crimson fell to the Gaels 7-5.
The games didn’t end there, and softball faced some of their toughest competition yet against experienced Loyola Marymount University. Harvard suffered a twin pair of losses in five innings, 10-0, and 10-2, respectively.
“LMU is pretty tough, definitely going to be one of the best teams we face all season,” Reed admitted.
After an exhausting schedule in California, the team finally returned to the east coast for their first big tilt in the Ivy League, against longtime rival Yale (3-10, 1-2 Ivy) in New Haven, CT. Showing up ready to win, Harvard did just that, besting the Bulldogs twice in one day, with 3-1 and 1-0 wins in the afternoon on March 18th.
“The strong competition that we faced in California definitely prepared us for Ivy League play,” Welsh remarked. “It was good for us to elevate our game and head into Yale with that mindset of being greedy and really trying to play the same at a faster pace and control the game.”
The only run scored in the second matchup occurred after junior outfielder/infielder Trina Hoang stole second base. Hoang subsequently scored on a fly out by Welsh.
The final game of spring break posed a tough loss for the Crimson, despite a late game offensive push. Down four runs in the 5th inning, junior Teagan Shaw’s home run changed the pace of the game for Harvard. RBIs from sophomore pitcher/infielder Madi Mays and junior catcher Allison Heffley continued Harvard’s offensive push. But even with a valiant comeback effort, Harvard couldn’t pull off a clean sweep of Yale, ending in a final score of 4-3.
This marked Shaw’s third home run of the season, causing her to inch past senior infielder Morgan Melito and Heffley to lead the team standings. May notched her first RBI of the season, and Melito’s RBI kept her leading the team with eleven to date.
The team is acutely aware of its play in the Ivy Conference, as it remains in the hunt to regain its championship status from the 2019 and 2020 seasons.
“In the Ivy League games, every game matters, whether it's a win or a loss, that's how it happens,” said Welsh, who was a first-year on the 2019 Ivy Championship team.
After being on the road for a majority of the season, the Crimson is eager to return to home field advantage this weekend. It hosts the Princeton Tigers (8-9, 3-0 Ivy) back at Soldiers Field at 12:30pm on Saturday, March 26th. This will mark its first home game since 2019, and the stands should be filled with Harvard fans and parents alike, as it coincides with the College’s junior parents’ weekend.
“We’re excited to continue what we played on Friday and move forward into next weekend,“ Reed said. “Just keep it going.”

Ah, spring. The buds budding, the breeze puffing, the rabbits by the Leveret Towers multiplying by the day. Everybody from that kid who wore flip flops to class in February to the girl who you’ve never seen without a hat, mittens, snow boots and parka combo pack are out to play, and it’s time to get vitamin D for the first time in five months. So here are some ideas for getting your spring frolic on:
Picnic by the River
Get some of that new dhall fig jam and sourdough combo, and create a charcuterie board with all the olives, goat cheese, mozzarella and shredded parm a takeout container can hold, and make for the river. Go full Bacchus with fancy beverages, and make yourself a crown out of leaves and flowers stolen from the dining hall spring bouquets. Bonus points if you don’t sit in goose shit.
Go for a joyride
Ride the shuttle over to the SEC and wander back. Take a blue bike over to MIT and gawk at everyone who goes there. Take the silver line to the airport, just to see what’s up. Commandeer an electric scooter and absolutely rip it through the yard. It will basically be Fast & Furious: Certified Nerd Edition.
Walk somebody’s dog
Ask your tutor or proctor to borrow their pup and stroll through the yard. It’s definitely not immoral to pretend it’s yours. Rename it for the hour. Anybody’s dog is fair game to borrow, just give it back at the end and tell it you’ll always love it. You could also ask to walk your tutor’s toddler, but try not to ask the child if they have a summer internship lined up.
Have a beach day
Either make a box of tea and go for a dip in the harbor, or put on your #springbreak2022 bikini and splash in the MAC pool. Don’t be intimidated by the Olympic level swimmers in the next lane: invite them for a game of chicken fight, and don’t forget that there are flippers and pool noodles in the boxes by the pool. The lifeguard may not be as down to share a piña colada as they were when you saw them in Puerto Rico over break, but don’t let their whistling dissuade you from throwing a pool party.
Refuse to do your homework
Free yourself from the chains of the productivity economy! Protest your pset and the ivory tower’s focus on achievement! Sacrifice your term paper at the hearth of freedom! For the love of God, just take an afternoon off of work and relax!
As the days get longer and warmer, do your best to get out and enjoy Cambridge. Work hard, but frolick harder.

Remember that fiery yellow ball of gas thing that lives in the sky and makes it warm sometimes? Well, now that it’s springtime, it’s coming back! Here are some of the things we’re most looking forward to about the rest of the semester’s more bearable climes.
