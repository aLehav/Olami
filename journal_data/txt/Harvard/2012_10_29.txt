After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Natural disaster is upon us, and with no class, take advantage of the catastrophe by catching up on work (or not) and relaxing to The Crimson's official Hurricane Sandy playlist.
Led Zeppelin—When The Levee Breaks
This thunderous Zep cover of an old Delta blues song should remind River House dwellers to be glad that the Charles is smaller, and less flood-prone, than the Mississippi.
Billie Holiday—Stormy Weather
Midterm to finish? Don't worry about it. This rainy-day classic, here performed by the great Lady Day, should lull you into the mood for a nap.
Wagner—Das Rheingold, Scene 4
From the final scene of "Das Rheingold," this selection depicts the god Donner calling the storm clouds, i.e., what you will see if you look out your window right now.
The Beatles—Rain
This trippy, middle-period Beatles b-side should remind you to chill out and stop complaining about how you can't go anywhere.
The Allman Brothers Band—Stormy Monday (Live)
This live cover, complete with an exquisite Duane Allman guitar solo, nails the day of the week as well as the atmosphere.
Red Hot Chili Peppers—Naked In the Rain
While frolicking in the rain with animals might not be the best idea in winds over 40 miles per hour, this funky deep cut off the Chili Peppers' finest album ("Blood Sugar Sex Magik") almost makes you feel like it would be.
Muddy Waters—Blow Wind Blow
More than any other genre of music, Delta blues has the hurricane on lockdown as subject matter, and this rollicking entry from the great Muddy Waters represents the tradition well.
The Jimi Hendrix Experience—Still Raining, Still Dreaming
Reveling in wah-wah excess, this track features some of Hendrix's most audacious guitar playing.
Bob Dylan—Hurricane
Despite the fact that its subject is not an actual hurricane, but rather boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, this song is indispensible for a hurricane playlist if only for its name. Dylan's poignant political message gives the song its heft.
Beethoven—Symphony No. 6 (Fourth Movement)
One of the greatest examples of program music, Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony includes this striking evocation of a storm, which should fit nicely with any ill-fated ventures to and from the Quad.
Bruce Springsteen—4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)
Though perhaps the most dubious entry in the playlist—the lyrics make no reference to a storm of any kind—this entry from the Boss is apt in light of how much of New Jersey is probably already underwater.
Adele—Skyfall
Adele's new single is meant for the upcoming James Bond film, but it fits the present meteorological situation perhaps even better. Her lyrics come on a little dramatically—"For this is the end / I've drowned and dreamt this moment," she intones—but her soulful voice is worth the listen.

Election season is that special time when, all across America, families and friends parrot party rhetoric instead of discussing the weather, and then Ohio elects the next president.
Among the timeless traditions of presidential election season is arguing that the opposing candidate is a neophyte on politics in the Middle East. As we saw in last Monday’s final presidential debate, President Obama and Mitt Romney are desperately and vainly trying to persuade voters that they offer two distinct choices for America’s foreign policy agenda. However, when it comes to relations with the Middle East, the distinction between them is practically nil.
Let’s briefly run through their positions on policy with the region’s most important countries.
In line with the world’s myopic fascination with Israel and the Palestinian territories, we’ll start there. Given Israel’s current domestic governing bloc, the total fragmentation of Palestinian governance in the West Bank, and the fact that Gaza’s elected government, Hamas, is committed to Israel’s destruction, Palestine would require significant development in the next four years for negotiations to be remotely possible or worthwhile. Sure, Romney would be quicker than Obama to praise Israel, but on actual policy, their positions would necessarily be remarkably similar.
Moving west, regardless of whether or not the Obama administration deliberately misled the public on last month’s attack in Benghazi, American foreign policy in Libya under either candidate would continue to awkwardly balance oil and security interests with humanitarian interests. Ditto for the rest of North Africa and the Gulf. During Monday’s debate, Romney even explicitly approved of Obama’s handling of the outbreak of revolution in Egypt.
Onward to Syria. Romney calls for American funds to arm Syrian militias that “share our values” and for the transfer of heavier weapons to those militias. Romney’s failure to specify what he means by heavier weapons or how we would locate groups with our values convinces me that these assertions are nothing more than campaign rhetoric. Like Obama in 2009, Romney in 2013 would similarly adopt positions more in line with the status quo than his campaign promises suggest.
When Vice President Joe Biden stopped chortling at the recent vice presidential debate, he and Romney’s running mate Paul Ryan engaged in a serious debate about the Obama administration’s handling of Iran’s nuclear weapons development. However, during the last presidential debate, Romney appeared much less critical of the administration’s efforts over the last four years. In fact, Romney could only vaguely promise “tightening sanctions” and “diplomatic isolation,” which are two approaches Obama and his administration likely already explored.
In a speech last month, Romney asserted, “When we look at the Middle East today—Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threatening to destabilize the region, with violent extremists on the march…it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the president took office.” Of course, he is right, but one can hardly blame the president for that reality, nor can Romney make a convincing case that the region would look differently had he been in office instead of Obama.
Admittedly, my country-by-country analysis may have sacrificed depth for breadth, but the point is that, even in the details, Obama and Romney’s policy prescriptions for the Middle East only differ by the platter they are presented on. Devoted to that platter more than the substance that rests on it, many Democrats and Republicans are deeply uncomfortable with the vast similarities between Obama and Romney’s platforms for foreign policy in the Middle East.
If the president’s record over the last four years has taught us anything, it is that campaign rhetoric rarely translates into policy. Since election season seems to endow Americans with selective hearing and collective amnesia, let us recall Obama’s plans four years ago.
Obama took office with many aspirations for the Middle East that were at best naïve—and more likely foolhardy. Direct negotiations to pacify Iran’s nuclear ambitions? Not quite. Force Israel and Fatah back to the negotiating table? Never mind. Normalization of relations with Syria as a path to peace in Palestine? Yikes. Immediate closure of Guantanamo Bay? LOL.
Obama’s foreign policy in the Middle East today is not reminiscent of Jimmy Carter’s, as Republicans sometimes suggest, but nor is it similar to the foreign policy Obama promised during his 2008 campaign. Don’t tell a party demagogue from either side, but it is largely an extension of the foreign policy built by the Bush administration.
Some of my friends, especially Jewish Americans and Arab Americans, describe themselves as “single issue voters,” in reference to Middle Eastern affairs. I would recommend that they find another issue to base their votes on in this election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four years ago, while most of us were still in high school, we watched helplessly as the global financial system crumbled. Many of our parents and neighbors lost their jobs, and our futures suddenly became much less certain than they had ever been. Since then, we’ve seen class after class of peers graduate into an unforgiving job market that is stubbornly slow to improve. We understand that this is not the recovery that the Obama administration predicted, but neither are we naïve about the severity of the crisis that preceded it. In fact, it is largely through the ingenuity of the Obama administration and Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’75 that we avoided the kind of depression witnessed in the 1930’s.
While President Obama’s stewardship of the economy has been admirable, it is important to also assess both the candidates’ past performances and their respective priorities when deciding who to support this November. The president is responsible not only for encouraging economic growth but also for establishing our national agenda. With his emphasis on education, innovation, and home investment, President Barack Obama is working to lay the groundwork for the kind of society we’ll be proud to enter upon graduation.
Education is the individual’s key to success in today’s society, as well as our nation’s key to success in the world at large. Barack Obama has shown himself to be a tireless advocate for students and, by extension, our national competitiveness. He has increased the amount of available Pell grants, and has successfully prevented interest rates on student loans from doubling. His 2010 restructuring of the federal student loan program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which ended the practice of subsidizing private-sector loans to students, has allowed increased funding to reach young people instead of flowing into the coffers of America’s largest banks. This kind of creative and effective solution demonstrates that the President is serious when he pledges to help American students get the education today’s economy requires. Additionally, the Obama administration has taken a hard line against for-profit universities, which frequently underperform in their educational mission. When it comes secondary education, the president has supported maintaining the accountability associated with No Child Left Behind, while easing up on the parts that are overly punitive and unconstructive. This focused flexibility is essential when solving problems as complex as K-12 education in America.
Mitt Romney, on the other hand, has oscillated between an intellectually impoverished game of “me too” on Pell grants and federal student loan interest rates, and a run-of-the-mill attack against conservative bêtes-noirs like universities, bureaucrats, and teachers unions. Furthermore, his unspecified commitment to balance the federal budget while reducing tax rates across the board and raising military spending force us to question whether those tax cuts for millionaires might come at the expense of student-oriented programs.
Yet the divergence in priorities does not end with education. President Obama believes in marriage equality; Mitt Romney opposes it. President Obama wants to mildly reduce military spending to create a more modernized force and free up funds for domestic investment; Mitt Romney wants to establish a minimum level of military spending, and raise it well above its current level. President Obama believes the government has a roll to play in encouraging the development of valuable industries like sustainable energy; Mitt Romney does not find such a roll for government. President Obama believes in a deficit reduction plan combining spending cuts and tax increases; Mitt Romney is a cosignatory of Grover Norquist’s “no-tax” pledge, which directly subordinates the government’s revenue-raising capabilities to a private interest group.
At the end of the day, this presidential race presents a stark choice between priorities.
Values are important. To treat this election as a referendum against some arbitrary standard of recovery in a nearly unprecedented economic crisis overlooks a large part of why we elect presidents. Not only has President Obama has shown himself an effective economic steward, but he also is prepared to make the choices necessary to keep America on top in the 21st century.

According to some of the best available data, the United States has, since 2004, killed anywhere between 2,500 and 3,300 people in Pakistan using drone strikes. Of those killed, around 500 to 900 are suspected of having been civilians, including 176 children.
And now, a just-released report compiled by Stanford and NYU students reveals how our country’s drone campaign, which has been expanded fivefold under Obama, is responsible for mass-suffering and civilian death in the northwest region of Pakistan.
The evidence offered in this new report, along with what we knew before, makes it clear that the US needs to significantly reform its use of drones in the region, if not completely abolish it.
The report exposes that, far from being the “surgically precise and effective tool[s]” most Americans believe them to be, drones are actually incredibly violent and messy. It points out that, “while civilian casualties are rarely acknowledged by the US government, there is significant evidence that US drone strikes have injured and killed civilians.”
The United States, in its Pakistani drone campaign (along with parallel campaigns elsewhere) has targeted a range of public establishments, from village squares to schools, in the pursuit of eliminating accused terrorists. This wide scope of targeted structures has, understandably, created a sense of fear and helplessness within the communities living under drones. As one villager interviewed in the report explains, “Everyone is scared all the time. When we’re sitting together to have a meeting, we’re scared there might be a strike. When you can hear the drone circling in the sky, you think it might strike you. We’re always scared.”
The terror experienced by these Pakistani citizens, a terror documented through the many interviews and polls within the report, is far from surprising. All one must do to understand it, in fact, is look at just who and what our government has attacked using drone missiles in the past.
Time and again, the US has claimed to have successfully eliminated multiple military targets in a strike, only to have it later revealed that there were heavy civilian casualties and few, if any, real militant deaths. Three such instances of this pattern are documented in detail by the Stanford-NYU report, and they serve to show just how unreliable the “official” accounts of drone attacks can be, while also highlighting the attacks’ innately devastating nature.
Add to this the fact that the Obama administration now officially records any military-age males killed in drone strikes as “militants”, and it’s not hard to see why these Pakistanis are so afraid for their lives.
The Obama administration has also approved the use of “signature strikes”, drone attacks that target individuals whose identities are unknown yet who seem to exhibit behavior in line with that of an active militant. The broad power this grants our government—to kill people we haven’t even identified living thousands of miles away—is frightening in its own right. Couple that power, though, with our track record for mistakenly killing civilians in the place of actual militants, and the terror felt by each person forced to live under our drones is made even more tangible.
Apart from engaging in signature strikes, the US has also seems to be willing to attack both the rescuers and mourners of drone victims. This practice is, on its face, morally grotesque, as it literally means we are targeting people who seek only to save others' lives or honor their deaths, those first-responders at the strike zone and those family and friends gathered at the funeral. Yet our government continues to commit these “follow-up” strikes in the hopes that they will kill further suspected terrorists, no matter the cost.
Such clearly unjust and destructive drone practices don’t just fill the affected Pakistani populations with terror, either. They also fill them with rage, and in doing so help foster the very anti-American sentiment that our foreign enemies thrive off of. In the report, an affected mental health professional notes “the impact [the drone program] has on personality development,” stating that “people who have experienced such things, they don’t trust people; they have anger, desire for revenge.”
So now, amongst all the collateral deaths and destroyed properties, we find that the policy we have instated to fight terrorism may very well be fueling it.
Consider that for a moment.
Not only does it turn out that our drones terrorize entire Pakistani villages, but they might not even achieve their intended goal of combating terrorism. We simply cannot continue a policy that so indiscriminately and insensitively kills innocent civilians, especially when its efficacy is so called into question.
In fact, because of its bloody record, our drone campaign has now come to embody the very terror it originally sought to vanquish.
Targeting emergency first-responders, or those gathered at funerals, or those attending village meetings, or those who’s identities we don’t know, or even those who are simply in the area and over eighteen—these are not the policies of a nation defending its freedom; these are the policies of a nation terrorizing another’s populace.
America now has the responsibility to either change or end its drone program. That’s it.
If we continue on like this we are embracing the very terrorism we claim to despise, and in doing so are abandoning the very values we claim to defend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m at Annenberg, talking about morality, when I hear, “What is that, philosophy? Sounds stupid.” As the stranger sitting across from me begins to tell me that you live and you die and life is just about living the most before then, I ask him what living the most entails if he’s never thought about these important questions. He answers bluntly: “The Count.” It’s his measure of how many girls he’s hooked up with since Harvard began—half a semester ago.
I would have thought it was a joke if he hadn’t begun reviewing the previous night’s expedition with his friend—two hangovers have better memory than one. Boston University party. Six in total, a decent night. Too bad he lost track of his total count after 57.
While few people take casual sex to this extreme, the hook-up culture at college is no rarity; 72 percent of us will hook up before we graduate. This is no surprise. Combine free condoms, distance from home, minimal responsibility, plentiful alcohol, and parties every weekend with the fact that sex just feels good and you have an equation for casual sex. But that doesn’t mean we should. The hook-up culture may seem like an elegant solution to the college life style—reap all the benefits of an orgasm without the commitment of a relationship—but it distorts and perverts our capacity to value each other. So, what’s wrong with two people agreeing to get mutual pleasure from each other without emotional attachment?
Nature thinks a lot. Whenever we hold hands, make intense eye contact, or have sex, we increase the concentration of oxytocin in the brain (sometimes up to 500 percent). Oxytocin makes us trust one another and form deep, affectionate bonds. Furthermore, every touch, every kiss, and every orgasm releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, which increases desire for something. When we release it during sex, we want to have more sex. Consequently, every hook-up is an uphill battle against nature—a conscious attempt to detach ourselves from emotions like care, trust, affection, and love by doing the very act which amplifies them. Biologically speaking, casual sex is never casual.
On a less scientific level, the hook-up culture undermines and even prevents us from forming genuine relationships. When people have casual sex, they are consciously acknowledging that another’s body is just a means for self-satisfaction, a basic tool for personal gratification. When sex holds pleasure as its primary motivation, when sex objectifies someone’s body, when sex requires neither respect nor companionship, only desire and a private—but that’s not even necessary—space, meaningful relationships cannot form. Maybe participants in the hook-up culture recognize that there are deeper levels of intimacy than hooking up, but just want to enjoy college while they still can. But how are people supposed to lead up to sex through constant dating if they’ve only learned how to lead up to dating through constant sex? How are people supposed to find a soul mate when they equate trust with sexual reliability, compatibility with pleasure, and love with lust?
During orientation week, Harvard makes an effort to educate its incoming class about the many temptations it will face on campus. Students are required to go to everything from Sex Signals to Extended Orientation workshops on drugs and alcohol. Harvard puts a lot of faith in the decision-making abilities of its students; it presents all of these issues not by taking a stab at what is ethically right and wrong, but rather what is safe and not safe, legal and not legal. Because of this, students confuse normative permissibility with moral acceptability. We ask: Is this physically safe? Is this legal? Okay, okay, at least legal-ish? But few consider: Am I treating this person as a human being ought to be treated? Is this action morally justifiable?  If we really are old enough to be making our own decisions, we ought to be mature enough to commit to the reflection necessary for making the right ones.
By participating in the hook-up culture, we reinforce the idea that the emotional energy required for sex is no different from that required for self-pleasure or pornography, we reinforce the belief that genuine relationships come second to an orgasm, we reinforce the notion that sex is just an emotionless, mindless, physical act. But sex is so much more than that. Sex becomes a deep, romantic, beautiful thing when combined with love and trust.
It’s not just sex.
It’s sex.

Ian A. Frazier ’73 has always had a knack for humor. Now a writer for The New Yorker, he has multiple publications under his belt: essay collections, humor books, nonfiction pieces. His latest novel, “The Cursing Mommy’s Book of Days”, brought Frazier back to Cambridge last week for a talk at the Harvard Book Store. Fifteen Minutes sat down with him to talk about childhood pranks, finding a voice, and his time at a porn magazine.
1. Fifteen Minutes: In Tina Fey’s book “Bossypants,” Fey says that she had one moment where she realized that she was funny. Can you recall the moment when you first realized that you were funny?
Ian A. Frazier: When Tina Fey told me I was funny. I’m kidding. It was something that I wanted to do since I was little. I’d like to make anybody laugh. I’d like to make my parents laugh, but it was very hard to make my father laugh. There probably was a point where I made my father laugh, and I thought, ‘Well, if I can make him laugh, I can make anybody laugh.’
2. FM: Do you have any stories from when you were a kid? Any crazy things that you did?
IAF: Mostly they were bad things—things that would get people mad at me. In our house we had a laundry chute, and I would drop army men and my brother would catch them at the bottom. Once, I thought it would be funny if, instead of an army guy with a parachute, I dropped a rock. He forgave me and my parents forgave me.
3. FM: Didn’t you write for the Lampoon?
IAF: Yes, and it was the greatest thing. I don’t think I’ve had that much fun since, to be honest. It was just exhilaratingly fun. It was what I wanted to do before I came here. Well, I probably would have wanted to come here anyway, but a guy four years older than I was who was on the Lampoon would send issues of the Lampoon back to my school. I read the Lampoon when I was in high school. When I came to Harvard, I was in Weld Hall. I put my bags away and went to the Lampoon and knocked on the door on my first day. I tried out as a freshman, and I got on. It was and it still is just a completely good thing.
4. FM: What were some highlights from your time at the Lampoon? Were you ever involved with any great Crimson pranks?
IAF: We did two parodies of The Crimson. One of the parodies of The Crimson, they [The Crimson] found out where our printer was and went and took all of the copies before we got there. But the Crimson guys forgot to take the plates. The [printer] place was closed by then, so we put the plates in the car and drove out in the middle of nowhere and found someplace that was opened and would print it. They didn’t have the right size paper so they printed it on paper that was too big, so we spent the rest of the night cutting the edges off. It didn’t have the regular serrated edge that The Crimson does, so it looked a little suspect, but we got it all done. We wrote parodies of people who are national pundits today like Michael Kingsley.
5. FM: What kind of work did you do immediately after graduating from Harvard?
IAF: There wasn’t a lot out there. Playboy was starting a new magazine called Oui, which was a copy of a French skin mag, and they needed people to work for it. They sent a letter to the Lampoon asking if anybody there wanted to come work. I wrote them back and they gave me a job. I went to Chicago, and I wrote captions for pictures of naked women. That was my first job.
6. FM: What was it like to be a writer for a porn magazine? Was it challenging?
IAF: It is incredibly challenging. It was a learning experience. You think you can write something like that and it’s easy. It’s like, ‘I went to Harvard. I should be able to do this.’ But it’s a talent, and it’s also a kind of frame of mind I guess.
7. FM: Did you have other odd-job writing assignments earlier in your career?
IAF: I did one piece for Harper’s where I went to Abercrombie & Fitch—back then it was mainly a sporting goods store—and I wrote down the name of every fishing lure that they had. I had lots and lots of fishing lures and I just wrote them down and gave it to Harper’s and they printed it. I had applied for The New Yorker, but they turned me down. In fact, they said they had too many people from Harvard. I reapplied, and the second time they did hire me.
8. FM: How long have you been writing?
IAF: I graduated in 1973 and I went to work for Oui, and I’ve been a writer since then, so almost 40 years. And when I got to The New Yorker, I was 23 and I was a staff writer. Now I’m a freelance writer with a contract, but then I was a staff writer. And I had to fill out a form for my pension plan because I was on the pension plan. It asks for the year when you will turn 65. And I was 23 and I added it up, and it was 2016. That seemed like far, far in the future; I mean, it was far in the future, but now it’s not.
9. FM: Where did you get your inspiration to write the “The Cursing Mommy”?
IAF: It was something in our family. I’m married and I have two kids. There are frustrations and you curse; it was the phrase that came up. One time we were driving and somebody cut my wife off, and she cursed. My daughter was little and she was in the back seat, and one of her friends said, ‘Oh Cora, your mommy cursed.’  Just the combination of those words.
10. FM: You have written on a variety of topics and in a variety of genres, from journalistic works like “Travels in Siberia” to humorous essays like “Dating Your Mom”. How do you manage to switch between these genres while maintaining a distinct style?
IAF: There are all different kinds of voices. There are thousands, millions. And sometimes you get into one that just has a way of telling a whole story, like Holden Caulfield’s voice. Where did that come from? It just ran cross-country and churned up the whole country, you know? It was a really powerful voice. With nonfiction, you can get a baseline of voice that you totally hear. And the way to get it is by reading Caesar’s “Gallic Wars.” Because the first sentence of that, “All Gaul is divided into three parts,” is the foundation of all nonfiction up to now. It’s such a beautiful, magic sentence. It seems so flat and straight, but there’s so much behind it. I mean, he conquered Gaul and then broke it up. There’s so much authority in that.
11. FM: How does your latest book compare from things that you have written in the past?
IAF: All writing is voice. I’ve written a lot of humor pieces, and those are very focused on voice. It’s actually more fun to listen to than to read. Sometimes you’ll read a piece where you don’t know what the writer is talking about, but the voice is great. I’ll find that with science writing sometimes—I won’t have any idea what the person is talking about, but there will just be something in there. You know, my brother-in-law is a professor of physics at BU, and I asked him what he was working on and he explained it to me. I had no idea what he was saying, but in it was a phrase, ”non-perturbative chromodynamics.” I thought, “That is so pretty,” and I wondered what that could possibly mean.
12. FM: Which writers have influenced your style the most?
IAF: There are hundreds, but every time I’m asked about what I read, I think, “Oh I left such-and-such out.” Somebody recently asked me about comic novels, and I listed a whole bunch of them. And I left out Ring Lardner—he just wrote so many hilarious things. I also love Mark Twain, Flannery O’Connor, Joseph Mitchell, Jamaica Kincaid. Jamaica is a friend; I remember first reading pieces by her and just being so astonished at the power of the voice and the details. In my generation, she’s the writer who I’ve admired and tried to emulate. James Thurber and E.B. White. A lot of poets—I think poetry and nonfiction can be very similar and especially in more recent times when poetry became more personal. For something like “The Cursing Mommy”, Charles Portis. Primo Levi, I think, is the greatest nonfiction writer of the twentieth century. But that’s a short list.
13. FM: What do you think about the idea that there are people out there that read your work and are inspired by you?
IAF: I would say they should read more widely. I mean that not in fake humility, but in that I think people do better to read authors a little bit farther back. I think people also do well by reading what they’re not supposed to. I would naturally read Mark Twain because I’m from the Midwest, but I think someone like that should also read things out of curiosity and out of interest. I’m flattered that people are inspired, but you do have to read. I don’t teach all that much, but when I do, I always say to students, “You’ve got to read all the time”. People say that they don’t want to read because it will influence their style. Don’t worry about that.
14. FM: How do you think the media and the print industry has been changing? Are people reading less and less in print?
IAF: It’s not like we’re not publishing books—more books come out now than ever. And having computers means that there are billions and trillions of words out there now that there didn’t used to be. I am often asked, “What do I think about the death of print?” And I always say, “Well, we’re here. We’re talking about books.” They may be on the way out but they’re certainly having a spasm at their death. The wonderful writer Anne Fadiman said about books, “A book is public”. And I think that is so profound. What you’re getting with your little thing like this iPhone, that’s private. But if you have a printed book, and you’re carrying that around, that is public. It’s like, “I want you to see me with ‘The Brothers Karamazov’ so you’ll know I’m a heavy person.” Or, you go to somebody’s guest house and there’s a book there. How would you encounter that otherwise?
15. FM: What do you do for fun?
IAF: I fish. I’ve fished my whole life. That’s one thing I do. I also like to look at the stars. I also walk a lot: I like to explore. I just walk about and look at stuff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If he wins his Sixth Congressional District race this November, Massachusetts Republican Richard Tisei will become the first Republican elected to Congress while openly gay. His coalitions director, Christian Berle, spoke about reconciling LGBTQ identities with Republican ideals on Friday at an event hosted by the Institute of Politics.
 
Tisei served in the Massachusetts State Legislature for 26 years, including four as minority leader of the State Senate. His sexual orientation “was one of those things well known on Beacon Hill but like many people, he did not feel the need to hold a press conference,” Berle said.
 
This changed when he ran for Lieutenant Governor in 2009, and advisers told him it was something the people had a right to know. Though his ticket lost the race, Tisei was “hailed as a strong asset to the ticket,” Berle said.
 
In this campaign, Berle said Tisei publicly countered the idea that being a gay Republican is an oxymoron. According to Berle, 3 out of 10 openly LGBTQ voters voted for John McCain in 2008, and, according to a recent Gallup Poll, 13 percent identify themselves as conservatives.
 
Berle, who is openly gay himself, argued that for LGBTQ voters, “[their] main focus, like the rest of the country, is jobs and the economy,” over gay-related civil rights issues.
 
“Throughout the nearly 12 months Richard has been campaigning, sexual orientation has rarely come up on the campaign trail—most often, those that ask are national media outlets,” he said. “Richard’s sexual orientation is just a characteristic of who he is, as would be being of Italian descent.”
 
Still, he said that the Republican party needs to change its stance on gay rights to be more in line with younger voters. Tisei has not encountered resistance from sitting members of Congress, Berle added, and hopes that introducing his partner of 18 years on Capitol Hill is one way to change their opinions about gay rights.
 
"None of the committees on the IOP have ever done anything like this," said C.J. Sutherland ’16, who organized the event. 
 
"I know of students who are both republican and BGLTQ, but none personally. I'm as liberal as it gets," said Powell C. Eddins ’16. "It was interesting to hear how much of an issue it really is within the Republican community."
 
Yet Simon Gregory, a student at the Kennedy School, said that in the United Kingdom, where he is from, openly gay members of Parliament come from all parties.
 
“Our barriers have been broken down years ago,” Gregory said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty Kennedy School students participated in an international crisis simulation Saturday morning, and were faced with the question of bombing Iran. Throughout the two-hour simulation, students received updates in letters, briefings, and video clips, and even participated in a simulated videoconference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
At 9:30 a.m., each team of 10 students received satellite photographs suggesting that Iran had built a nuclear test site. When Iran shot down a US drone that had been sent to gather further evidence, Israel and Congress began asking questions. Then details were leaked to the press, and the issue became political given the nearing presidential election.
Elaine C. Kamarck, a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School, played the U.S. president and visited each team four times during the simulation. At the end of the event, she sat at the head of the table, listening to final recommendations from each student.
After the simulation, Matthew Bunn, a professor of public policy, debriefed the students. Participants said they enjoyed the high-pressure simulation, which was planned by several students who wanted to give their classmates an opportunity to learn about international crisis management outside of a traditional classroom setting.
“I really liked being put into a time-pressure situation, being forced to analyze information very quickly, make decisions, and work in a high-pressure environment,” said Samuel D. Ward, a Kennedy School student who played the role of Secretary of Defense.
Furthermore, the simulation provided a learning opportunity not available in the classroom, added Richard J. Witt, another student. “Instead of just talking about decision making, you have to make a decision, and I think it makes a difference,” Witt said.
Leon Ratz, the student who headed planning for the simulation, also noted the unique nature of this learning opportunity. “The one thing we really wanted to see happen is people learn something about national security decision making,” he said. “And I think you can’t really get that out of a textbook. You might not be able to get that out of a class.”
Ratz also noted that demand for the event was very high. He said that 140 students applied for only 20 positions.The simulation was held in commemoration of the Cuban missile crisis, which took place 50 years ago this month. On November 1, participants will meet with Dan H. Fenn '44, an executive education instructor who served as an advisor to President John F. Kennedy '40.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The John Harvard statue uprooted himself from his normal spot outside University Hall on Friday to strut down a table-top runway in Annenberg during the annual Halloween Costume Catwalk.
At the end of the runway, the statue, a freshman sporting a bronzed face and gray suit, returned to his “chair,” placed in front of the judge’s table. Then, Matthew T. Barber '16, one of the event’s emcees, placed his foot on John Harvard’s knee to mimic the late-night tradition of urinating on the University’s namesake.
John Harvard was joined on the runway by other major Harvard names such as a Natalie Portman ’03 in Black Swan costume and a T.S. Eliot, a graduate of the Class of 1910. The Halloween models vied for victory in one of four costume categories: most original, best group, scariest, and most original group.
For the yearly event, the First Year Social Committee, which organized the night, transformed Annenberg into a haunted hall, lights dimmed and electric candles placed throughout the room. Three freshman resident deans—dressed as Severus Snape, a wizard, and Peeves the Poltergeist—judged the Catwalk alongside Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who came as Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore.
“The FDO staff has turned out in Hogwarts fashion,” Dingman said.
Sue Brown, resident dean of Elm Yard wearing Professor Sprout attire, photographed the event. Assistant to the Dean of Freshmen Brandon Edwards rounded out the Hogwarts entourage as Harry Potter himself.
“We are looking for originality and sense of humor,” Dingman said. “Every year, we’re blown away by the talent in the class.”
Jack F. Weyen '16 also showed off his costume on the runway. He wore a leisure suit, male-symbol necklace, groomed moustache, and slicked-back hair. “I’m what the ’70s actually looked like,” said Weyen, who paraded down the runway and leapt into a full split.
This acrobatic feat, coupled with his realistic costume, earned him the prize of “scariest” costume, said  Anna Y. H. Zhong ’16, a member of FYSC.
Zhong said the other winners were “The Apley Court nerds” for the group category, Brett M. Biebelberg '16, who dressed as a water cooler, for most original, and Taylor L. Benninger '16 and Dawn A. Loggins '16, who dressed as pirate and sailor steering a cardboard “H.M.S. Scaritas,” for most original.
Winners will receive gift cards to Harvard Square businesses.
FYSC member Jacqueline M. DelMuto '16 came to the event she helped organize styled as Pebbles from the Flintstones. “It’s a fun way for people to express themselves,” she said of the night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Adelaide H. Pagano arrived at Harvard Law School in 2011, she knew she wanted to work in the public sector.
She had previously served as a paralegal at a law firm specializing in labor issues and had volunteered for a non-profit law firm. After her first year at law school, she worked as an advocate for low-wage workers and became passionate about issues such as prisoners’ rights and labor unions.
Despite the security and financial benefits of taking a job in the private sector, Pagano has decided to pursue her interest in the public sector. But many law students who decide to take that route have to work especially hard to find a public interest job.
Public service law opportunities—particularly for newly minted attorneys—are limited, a discouraging reality for which the Law School has tried to prepare its students. Under pressure to secure employment and pay off loans, some students accept positions at top law firms instead of pursuing careers in government or the non-profit world.
First year salaries at private sector law firms tend to run at $160,000, while some non-profits in the public sector tend to pay between $40,000 and $50,000, according to Assistant Dean for Public Service Alexa Shabecoff. This range, however, does not reflect federal government salaries, Shabecoff said.
Though the Law School has established new programs and fellowships for students forgoing the private sector, institutional support has yet to balance the divergent incentives of public and private law.
“It’s a little bit jarring to turn down that much money. You don’t think that that’s going to matter, but it does, a little bit,” Pagano said. She added later, “I think [the public sector is] really where my heart is, at least for now.”
TWO PATHS
When Pagano returned to campus this fall, she had to decide whether or not to participate in Harvard’s Early Interview Program, the largest law school recruiting program in the country.
The Law School’s EIP—during which 11,000 interviews are held in five days—is solely for private sector law firms. Though family members pointed out to Pagano that it did not make sense for her to participate given her interests, Pagano said she ultimately gave into the “herd mentality” and bid for EIP interviews. “Pretty much all of my friends were participating in it, and I think I ultimately felt like I didn’t want to close any doors,” she said.
After first-round interviews and second-round callbacks, Pagano was offered a summer associate position at a firm in Boston. Pagano said she loved the people at the firm, and was surprised to find herself considering the financial benefits of taking a job in the private sector.
Pagano ultimately chose to turn down that summer associate position. She has yet to secure a summer job, and said she is aware that summer positions in the public sector rarely result in an offer for full-time employment after graduation. With this tough reality weighing on her mind, Pagano said she understands why the Office of Career Services tends to encourage undecided students to interview through EIP.
“I also think that their job is to get people jobs, and so they want to get as many people to do EIP as possible,” she said. “It boosts their numbers. It makes them look good. It sort of helps everybody.”
Pagano is optimistic and said she hopes to have summer plans in place by the beginning of November.
“The saga continues,” she said.
FOUR TIMES THE WORK, ONE FOURTH THE PAY
Sitting down in her bright office in the Law School’s new Wasserstein building, Shabecoff gestured toward the plushy blue chairs by the window—a symbol of her efforts to make difficult one-on-one counseling sessions with students more comfortable.
The conversations she has with socially-minded students about the future of their careers are often sobering.
“One of the ironies in life that I joke about with students is you work four times as hard to get a quarter of the money in public interest,” Shabecoff said of getting a job in the public sector.
She added, though, that students who persevere do find jobs.  "I want them to feel empowered to do the work anyway," she said.
In recent years, Harvard Law School has made special efforts to encourage students like Pagano to pursue public interest law: in 2009 HLS founded the Holmes Public Service Fellowships, and in 2010 it established the Redstone Fellowships.
Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow has said that she is committed to supporting students who pursue public service. Before becoming dean, she oversaw curricular reforms that led to the creation of a new program of study called “Law and Social Change.” In 2010 she rolled out the Public Service Venture Fund.
Despite these efforts on the institution’s part, public interest law does not have a recruiting process equivalent to EIP in scale. Instead, Harvard hosts a week of on-campus interviewing for second- and third-year students with some 30 public interest organizations. “I beg our students not to rely on that as a job search means,” Shabecoff said.
Though Shabecoff said she would love to see a similar program for public interest careers, she acknowledged that public interest organizations would not participate.
“They don’t have an incentive really to come recruit on campus because people want to do this work anyway despite the extra work...and the relative lower pay,” she said, adding that public firms also have limited budgets.
Julia K. Gegenheimer, who graduated from the Law School in 2010 and now works as a trial attorney for the Civil Rights division of the Department of Justice, said she remembers the contrast between private and public sector recruiting. Unlike many of her peers, Gegenheimer said she had to do a lot of legwork, researching organizations and fellowships to fund summer opportunities.
Pagano said she was proactive in setting up informational interviews over the summer. This semester, while most of her friends have their summer positions locked down from EIP, she has had to continue interviewing for jobs.
“Last week, I went to two different offices, and I’m dressed up in my suit, and I’ve got to go to class, and then I go straight from class downtown to this interview and then I go straight back so that I can go to a group meeting,” she said. “It’s a little nutty. And it would be great to not have to do that.”
THE PRIVATE SECTOR ROUTE
Like Pagano, fellow law students Tyanthony B. Davis and Daniel Balmori had positive experiences working in the public sector. But Davis and Balmori have decided to accept positions in corporate law firms instead, discovering that despite the recent economic downturn, private sector jobs are easy to find.
Davis, a second-year law student who worked for Teach for America before coming to Cambridge, said he was set on doing transactional law in Los Angeles. After 22 interviews in five days—and before the second round of callbacks even began—he had accepted an offer from a firm and his search was complete.
Though Davis said “it was scary” to commit early, he never worried that he would not find a job. “There are plenty of jobs to go around,” he said of private sector recruiting.
Despite the impact of the financial crisis on private sector law, Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark A. Weber said that firms continue to hire Harvard students.
Though the number of summer associate positions available at the top 100 law firms in the U.S. fell nearly 50 percent between 2008 and 2012, Harvard’s hiring rate only decreased by 4.3 percent.
Balmori, another second-year at the Law School, spent the summer after his first year working at the Civil Rights division of the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. But Balmori said he knew that come August, he would be applying to work at corporate law firms. He felt that working at the Department of Justice was his “last chance...to do something a little bit different.”
“I know that right now the best place for me to hone my craft is at a private firm,” he said.
Weber said that because of the challenging financial climate and the high cost of law school, students need to keep post-graduate salaries in mind.
“You’ve got to be practical,” he said. “That’s the biggest takeaway. People have to think long and hard about who they are, what’s important to them, and most importantly if there are jobs.”
While the effects of the financial crisis were immediate on the private sector, Shabecoff said that public interest law was affected more gradually, and that the public sector is taking longer to recover.
Gegenheimer said she has also observed this trend. When she first applied for a position at the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights division, there were 10 positions available. The next year there were none, and this year there are three.
Despite the obstacles she has faced, Pagano said that she is not bitter and noted that many of her friends headed to private firms care about social issues as much as she does.
“I think it’s good to try not to be super dogmatic and ideological about stuff,” Pagano said. “It doesn’t make you a good or bad person, so I don’t see the point in trying to draw battle lines.”
RETAINING PASSION
In an effort to keep spirits high among students heading to the social sector—a number that has been increasing in recent years—Harvard has developed an “infrastructure to retain passion,” Shabecoff said.
“A lot of people come here with a lot of idealism and a strong commitment to public service, and we’ve gotten better at helping them retain that,” she said, noting that her office seeks to provide students both financial and moral support through community-building events and personal connections. “I’m a hugger,” she said.
Adelaide said the Office of Public Interest Advising told her that while her eventual job might not be exactly what she wants to do or where she wants to do it, she will secure public interest work.
"It's good to know you have people behind you with experience who really want to help you [and] see you succeed," she said.
The resources the Law School has devoted to helping students in this field is not in spite of the difficulties, but because of them.
Harvard offers Summer Public Interest Funding, which is guaranteed summer funding for a broad range of summer jobs that offer little to no compensation. The Law School also has a Low Income Protection Plan in which graduates can pay a portion of their loans while LIPP covers the remainder depending on their income.
Gegenheimer received two separate fellowships for international public service work. The first was the Insight Collaborative Fellowship, which allowed her to spend a year between college and law school in Cyprus, Cambodia, and the Hague. She later spent a summer at a Sudanese refugee camp in Chad with funding from Harvard's Chayes International Public Service Fellowship.
“I think it’s a shame to let external pressures push you away from that goal, especially at a place like HLS where there’s so much support for students who want to do public interest work,” Gegenheimer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In politics, money speaks, and with election day only a little more than a week away, many Harvard University employees have clearly stated which Harvard grad they would like to see in the White House for the next four years.
A vast majority of Harvard donors have cast their cash for President Barack H. Obama, who raised $579,865 through the end of September, dwarfing Republican Mitt Romney’s $60,636 total, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
Both Obama and Romney spent formative years at Harvard, and maintain close contacts and friendships with professors here. Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991. Romney earned a joint J.D./M.B.A. from the Law and Business Schools in 1975.
The huge disparity in contributions between the two campaigns highlights the Democratic leanings of the faculty, whose members constitute the vast majority of employee donors.
Despite his cash advantage over Romney, Obama’s fundraising figures at Harvard have dropped significantly since 2008, as excitement about his candidacy has waned on campus and nationally. During that campaign, Harvard University employees were one of then-Senator Obama’s biggest donor groups, collectively raising close to $900,000.
Still, a group of professors, many of whom taught and became friends with Obama during his time here, have given to his campaign this time around.
University professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 has given Obama $5,000, the maximum donation amount allowed for individuals. Tribe has called Obama, his one-time research assistant, the best student he has taught at the Law School.
Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., another of Obama’s former professors and a close friend, has also given the president the maximum allowed amount.
Romney has his own tight-knit group of Harvard supporters, many of whom are friends and have been advisers to his past presidential and gubernatorial campaigns. Business School professors Clayton M. Christensen and Michael E. Porter both advised Romney in 2008. Though they are not serving the campaign in official capacity this time around, they have each donated $5,000 during the general election, as well as $2,500 during the GOP primary.
Though his Harvard fundraising total is lower overall, Romney’s average donation size of about $1000 is four times that of Obama.
University fundraising figures represent contributions made directly to presidential campaigns by individuals who reported working for Harvard. They do not account for donations made by employees to political action committees or other political organizations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 29, 2012, at 12:04 a.m.
On one side of the showroom is the ideal modern living space: two taupe-colored sofas surround a dark wooden coffee table and a television stand of the same stain. On the other side of the room, a vision of productivity: a desk with shelving units and a swivel chair for working.
This was not one of IKEA’s latest showrooms, but one of four rooms which were showcased Friday at the Student Organization Center at Hilles as part of the College’s House Renewal project.
Earlier this year, the College announced that it would purchase and provide common room furniture for all the Houses in order to eliminate the need for storage space and prevent future students from having to buy furniture each year. This year, students in New Quincy and in swing housing received new furniture like these models as part of the College’s ongoing renovation project.
The tour gave students the opportunity to vote on which rooms and pieces of furniture they liked the best, as the College plans to expand renovation efforts to Leverett next year and to Dunster in 2014.
Each house will receive common room furniture when it undergoes the renewal process. According to Assistant Dean of FAS Physical Resources Merle Bicknell, the House Renewal project will ensure that every student will have a common room space.
Once the College has narrowed down its choices of local New England vendors, it will place an order in January and test the new furniture in Quincy House in September.
Though few students attended Friday’s tour, the College showed the furniture options all week, inviting resident deans and members of the House Committees to attend. Bicknell said the College, when selecting these models, took into account students’ feedback on previous models, like with the mock-up they produced for Quincy earlier this year.
Since many students complained about the desk chairs in dorm rooms, the College will provide chairs that are more comfortable and can move, Bicknell said. The vendors provided several potential options on Friday.
The College is also considering whether to provide futons or sofas, dressers that could be disassembled and used as under-the-bed storage, wardrobes with mirrors included, and desks that have attached electrical outlets. Another option considered was the inclusion a Harvard crest on all the beds—which would be able to adjust for different heights.
Bicknell also said that the College will set aside a budget for replacing and cleaning furniture each year.

As Hurricane Sandy barrels toward Cambridge, Harvard University plans to cancel classes for the first time in 34 years. In an email to the College, Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has canceled all Monday classes because of the hurricane, but dining halls will remain open. Restrictions that ordinarily bar upperclassmen from eating in Annenberg and non-residents from eating in Adams and Quincy Houses will be lifted for the day, the email said, allowing all students to eat in the most convenient dining halls.
An earlier post on the University website announced that Harvard had suspended “all but core operations” for Monday, meaning that non-essential employees would not be expected to come to work.Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 urged colleges and universities to cancel classes in a Sunday afternoon press conference, after declaring a State of Emergency for the Commonwealth.
In the past, Harvard has been notoriously reluctant to cancel classes because of bad weather—in 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III quipped that “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.” The last weather-related closure was caused by the historic blizzard of 1978. Before that, the University had not closed since a catastrophic 1938 hurricane.
When asked if Hurricane Sandy constituted such an “act of God,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin responded in an emailed statement that Harvard decided to close “out of concern for the hazard presented by the approach of Hurricane Sandy and in accordance with the Governor’s guidance.”
The National Weather Service issued a high wind warning for Cambridge on Sunday, citing the possibility of sustained winds of 35 to 45 miles per hour and gusts of up to 75 miles per hour.
The peak of the storm, according to Bill Simpson, a meteorologist from the National Weather Service, will likely reach the Boston area Monday morning. Simpson said that although the center of the hurricane will be primarily over New Jersey, widespread power outages in the Boston area are likely.
After the announcement, Harvard students stocking up on emergency supplies cleaned out shelves in the CVS on Mass. Ave. Dozens waited in line to purchase water bottles, doughnuts, potato chips, and gallons of tea—anything that could possibly come in handy if Sandy were to trap undergraduates in their dorms.
“I don’t really want to leave my room tomorrow,” said Keziah A. Imbeah ’16, who carried a basket full of cookies and bottled water as she searched a barren shelf for soup. “It’s something you might see on the news,” she said of the chaotic scene in the convenience store.
In light of the hurricane, the admissions office granted prospective students an extension on the deadline for early action applications. The announcement, posted on the admissions website, stated that the off
ice will accept any late applications with a note of explanation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Instead of heading to classes and attending regularly scheduled activities, Columbia University student Arvin Ahmadi ’14 and his roommates will be eating chips and watching movies in their dorm room for today and much of tomorrow.
From Massachusetts to New York to Virginia, several universities on the east coast have announced their decisions to cancel classes in anticipation of the arrival of Hurricane Sandy. Both in dorm rooms and on the web, students have expressed more delight than concern about the impending storm.
“There is a general consensus of excitement, which is ironic because we are excited about a natural disaster,” Ahmadi said. “It’s basically an excuse to get lots of junk food and have bonding time with my roommates.”
In addition to sleeping in until noon, Ahmadi said he plans to spend the day making hot cider and playing board games.
Soon after Bucknell University’s president sent out an email to students about cancelling classes from 2 p.m. on Monday to noon on Tuesday, Bucknell student Kaisha E. Johnson ’14 said students started celebrating what they dubbed the “Hurrication,”—a neologism combining hurricane and vacation—and posting Facebook statuses that read, “Thank you, Bucknell.”
Like Columbia, Georgetown University has taken its precautions a step further and cancelled classes on Tuesday as well. For Charles J. Kim ’15, this means an extra day to catch up on work and to study for his midterm, which was postponed to Friday.
Kim said that while some students stocked up on food and water, most people were more welcoming than afraid of the hurricane.
“I know a couple friends who were definitely celebrating and even going out,” Kim said. Other than causing the cancellation of classes, Sandy has affected students in other ways as well.
Maya M. Fegan ’14, design editor of the Columbia Daily Spectator, the school’s daily newspaper, said the paper will not print on Tuesday. In addition, Fegan was supposed to fly out to Guyana on Wednesday, but she said she suspects the flight will be cancelled.
Gabe R. Murchison ’14, a Yale University student who lives off campus, said he temporarily moved in to a friend’s dorm room last night when the College asked off-campus students to relocate to a safer space.
“Most folks I know are staying with friends,” he said, “while some are spending the night in College libraries.”
Murchison said he feels safer on campus because the dining hall are open and dorm rooms are less likely than his off-campus housing to experience power outages. Murchison said he plans to stay on campus for the night and may remain there until tomorrow afternoon depending on the weather.
Down in Virginia, Kate A. Stephensen, a first year masters student at University of Virginia Curry School of Education, said she is most worried about losing power because she needs her computer for most of her work. Stephensen, who also is an open water swimmer, said she will not be making a trip to the river anytime soon.
“Certainly no swimming today,” she said.
However, some universities on the east coast, including Duke University and Cornell University, remain open despite the gloomy weather.
“People’s hopes are low because we never get classes cancelled, even when we have snowstorms,” said J. Blake Marchese ’14, a student at Duke University.
Marchese said that while he has not perceived much alarm on campus about the hurricane, he thinks it is a little bizarre that Duke has chosen to have classes when all other colleges in the area have cancelled.
“That being said, given the weather right now, there is no real reason to cancel classes,” Marchese said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—The situation looked bleak for the Harvard football team a week ago. After a stunning 39-34 loss at the hands of the Princeton Tigers, gone was that nation-best winning streak, gone were any “best Harvard team of the modern era” claims, and more shockingly, for the first time in two years, gone was the Crimson’s ability to control its own destiny in Ivy League play.
But after last week’s did-that-really-just-happen loss, relative order has been restored in the Ivy League.
That glass slipper might just fit. Who knows? The guy might get the girl, the hero might vanquish the villain.
Because after Princeton’s 37-35 loss to Cornell, coupled with Harvard’s 31-14 win over Dartmouth, the Crimson is back in a tie for first place in the Ivy League, back in control of its destiny. What once seemed like a far-fetched, statistical improbability—a second straight sole Ivy League title—is very much back on the table. After all that, the Crimson may still achieve that happily ever after.
More than that, it’s hard not to think that Harvard is, once again, the favorite to take it all, or at the very least a share of the Ancient Eight crown.
For starters, despite that loss to Princeton, Harvard still boasts the league’s top offense plus a defense that leads the FCS in rushing yards allowed and sacks. Yes, the Crimson is still the class of the conference. Just ask Tigers coach Bob Surace.
“They’re the best team in the league by far…. There’s a reason they won 14 in a row,” Surace said last week following his team’s shocking victory.
A look at the schedules also indicates that despite that ugliest of ugly losses, the Crimson might still emerge on top all by its lonesome. With three games left in the season, Harvard faces Penn—the best challenger left—and two of the league’s three worst teams: Yale and Columbia. Princeton, meanwhile, still has dates with Dartmouth and Penn left on the docket, both of which could knock the Tigers off their perch atop the Ancient Eight.
For Crimson fans, that’s all well and good. But just because Saturday’s contest against the Big Green ended on a cheery note doesn’t mean that the Crimson shined or dominated.
When Harvard played Dartmouth in a blizzard last season, the Crimson put together a masterpiece, with three different players rushing for over 100 yards for the first time in program history.
If that was a perfect 10, Saturday’s performance against Dartmouth was a 6.5. Maybe. It wasn’t pretty, but it was enough to get the job done.
Sure, Dartmouth is the most complete team Harvard has played so far, according to Crimson coach Tim Murphy. The Big Green came into the contest leading the Ivy League in total defense and tied for second in the conference standings. And playing in another team’s house on Homecoming under the lights in front of fans with a unique gift for heckling can make the climb to the top that much more arduous.
That doesn’t explain away what wasn’t far from another blown second-half lead. Up 21-0 entering the break, the Crimson looked as dazed and confused entering the third quarter as it did in the fourth quarter a week ago against Princeton. For Harvard, it was the recurring nightmare that looked like it might define its season.
The Crimson attack that boasts eye-popping horsepower and can accelerate from 0 to 60 in a snap was sputtering. Taking out the last drive of the quarter, which ultimately led to a Harvard touchdown, the team tallied just 50 yards in the period to go with three three-and-outs plus a fumble recovered by Dartmouth at the Harvard 22.
The secondary that was so polite to Princeton in those final 15 minutes—no, after you, monsieur—was struggling against the no-huddle offense and falling apart once again, and the Harvard defense allowed 187 yards of total offense.
In total, Dartmouth scored 14 third-quarter points—and on another possession was stopped at the one—to make it a ballgame entering the fourth.
But unlike last week, Harvard put this one away, answering with 10 fourth-quarter points while holding Dartmouth scoreless to earn the much-needed 31-14 win.
And though the Big Green actually outgained Harvard in the contest, 397-382—by comparison, Chapple threw for more yards last week than Harvard gained total this week—the Crimson looks like it has regained its mojo and shrugged off the devastating Princeton loss.
And now, it’s on to the next one. But unlike last week, and for the 11th time in the past 12 league contests, Harvard’s fate is now firmly in its own hands. Share or not, it’s once more Harvard’s title to lose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the San Francisco Giants taking a 3-0 lead in the World Series heading into tonight’s game at Comerica Park, we at The Crimson would like to offer our take on who Harvard students should root for. As Giants ace Matt Cain takes the hill against Detroit flamethrower Max Scherzer—whose 231 strikeouts this year were second only to teammate Justin Verlander—, here are a couple factors on which to base your choice.
Position Within the Series
With the Tigers trying to do what no team has ever done before in World Series history—come back to win after being down 3-0 in the series—, they are definitely in the role of the underdog here and grab the sentimentality card. Harvard students that love the underdog and want to see the little guy win may elect to root for Detroit’s finest in the final four games of the series. The Giants have played gritty baseball thus far in fighting off six elimination games—including winner-take-all games against the Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals—but now take the role of the heavy favorite moving forward.
Style of Play
For old school, blue-collar students who favor steady success over flashy play, the Giants are your team.  Only five teams cracked more home runs in the second half of the season than the Giants—who win on the strength of pitching and defense—have all year (103). The two biggest hitters on the Tigers squad, Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera and Prince Fielder, cracked 87 between the two of them.
History at Stake
At Harvard, the Ivy League’s oldest educational institution, history matters. History majors can appreciate how baseball, a game full of statistics and the past, could have its history books rewritten as the next seven days unfold. The Giants are seeking to become only the second National League team since 1934 to win two World Series championships in three years, while Detroit is looking for its first championship since 1984. Detroit is the first team ever to feature a Triple Crown pitcher (Verlander) and hitter (Cabrera) on the same squad, while the Giants have tied a major-league record by fighting off the aforementioned six elimination games in a single postseason.
Team Makeup
For students who believe in the power of collective action and group work, the Giants are the squad to support. They have received contributions from nearly every member of the team and no team gets more from so many different players. The Tigers, on the other hand, are the epitome of individual excellence. Behind stars in Cabrera, Fielder, Verlander, and Scherzer, the team features little depth and have ridden the coattails of their four best players all season long.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.— The nature of the Harvard football team’s 31-14 win can be accurately summed up by a first-quarter play that started at the Crimson’s own four-yard line.
Senior quarterback Colton Chapple dropped back for a pass but was quickly greeted by a blitzing linebacker who had a clear shot at a safety. Somehow, Chapple escaped the rusher and scrambled to his left for an 11-yard gain, only to fumble the ball near the sideline. But junior wideout Andrew Berg was there to fall on the ball to regain possession for Harvard.
That series of events represents all 60 minutes of play Saturday not only because it brought some of Chapple’s 88 rushing yards, but also because Dartmouth missed several opportunities to make game-changing plays, as was the case all evening. On the other side, the Crimson took advantage of enough chances to beat the Big Green for the 15th time in the last 16 contests despite being outgained in total yards for the first time all season.
Late in the third quarter, Harvard found itself holding on to a 21-14 lead and in desperate need of some momentum. After failing to progress past its own 40, the Crimson took over with strong field position at the Harvard 45.  From there, Chapple completed two passes for first downs with senior Treavor Scales’ longest run of the day, a 19-yard scamper, coming in between. Two goal line runs later and the visiting offense had taken advantage of the opportunity provided by its defense to open up a two-touchdown lead.
Dartmouth appeared poised to post a response on its ensuing possession, methodically driving into Harvard territory with a series of short passes, including a fourth-down conversion. But before what would have been a third-and-two from the Crimson 43, the Big Green was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct and pushed back 15 yards, neutralizing the home’s team momentum. A Harvard field goal minutes later would put the game out of reach.
Though the final score may have suggested otherwise, Saturday’s contest was a close battle decided by a few bounces of the ball and short stretches of success. In big moments, the more experienced Crimson seemed to come out on top more times than not, like in the red zone, where Harvard came away with points on all five of its trips while Dartmouth was shut out on both of its red-zone chances.
“At the end of the day it comes down to 120, 140-odd snaps,” Big Green captain Pat Lahey said. “We had a lot of opportunities to make some plays, and Harvard made some plays when it needed to, and it showed in the end result.”
TACKLES FOR WIN
The remarkable has become the expected—another week, another dominant performance by the Crimson defensive front. This week, the team combined for six sacks, including two apiece for senior John Lyon and sophomore Zach Hodges. Harvard now leads the FCS in sacks per game at 4.71, nearly a full sack better than any other team in the conference. And despite playing in two fewer games than the second-place team, the Crimson has 36 more sack yards than any other FCS squad.
As scary as Lyon, Hodges, and Co. have been against the pass, running the ball on them has proved equally futile. Despite generally using a ground-based attack, the Big Green knew coming into the week they could not rely on picking up yards running the ball.
“They challenge you to throw the football, by design,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “They outnumber [you] in the box, and they’ve got some very solid players. They play eight guys, and they are all very good.”
At the end of the day, the Big Green had tallied just 19 yards on 24 carries, but it wasn’t the first victim to Harvard’s run-killing buzz saw. The Crimson leads the FCS in rushing yards allowed per game and is the only team holding opponents to less than two yards per run, as foes have averaged just 1.73 yards per attempt.
NOZONE PROBLEM
Even though Harvard pulled away to win Saturday, the play most football fans will remember from the game was a 68-yard catch-and-run by Dartmouth receiver Ryan McManus that earned the No. 4 spot on ESPN’S Sportscenter Top 10. McManus leaped to pull down a pass and then broke half a dozen tackles before sprinting to the end zone.
But that wasn’t the Big Green’s only big play through the air. Despite the rush the Crimson’s front four has generated, the defense has struggled at times to stop the pass. Last week, Princeton’s Roman Wilson gained over 100 yards in the second half. This week, Michael Reilly had a career night, catching 12 balls for 165 yards and a touchdown, while quarterback Alex Park reached 300 yards for the first time in his career despite being sidelined with an injury late in the game.
“We can live with some of the yards; we’ve just got to play great red-zone defense,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Not that we don’t have a lot of room for improvement—we do. Our next step is to become a really good overall balanced defense, and we are making a lot of progress.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its most important meet of the season, the Harvard cross country team turned in a strong performance against its Ancient Eight rivals. At the Heptagonal Championships, held at Princeton’s West Windsor Fields, the Crimson women finished in a tie with Brown for third place, while the men earned a fifth-place finish.
“Overall, I was very pleased with how our men and women competed,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Especially the women, they did a great job of handling the pressure and just having a great, great race.”
Led by a standout showing by senior Samantha Silva, Harvard recorded 93 points on the day, just two behind the second-place Tigers. Silva covered the women’s six-kilometer course in 20:39, which was good for sixth place and first-team All-Ivy honors.
“Sammy did a phenomenal job” Saretsky said. “She got out really well and put herself right with the front group. It got a little tough, but she battled through it.”
Behind Silva for the Crimson were juniors Emily Reese and Morgan Kelly, who just missed breaking the 21-minute mark, crossing the finish line in 21:03 and 21:06, respectively. Sophomore Viviana Hanley was not far behind the duo, coming in 22nd place with a time of 21:09. Harvard’s final scorer was sophomore Alaina Alvarez, who took home 33rd place overall.
With the exception of Reese, Kelly, and Hanley, the outing was unusual for the Crimson. All season long, the women’s squad has earned its success by running together and keeping its pack time low. Despite finishing with a one-minute spread from Silva to Alvarez, the team was able to turn in its best showing at Heps in three years.
“I think we did really well,” Alvarez said. “It’s a step in the right direction, definitely an improvement from last year and the year before.”
Cornell took home the women’s team title, scoring just 31 points after Katie Kellner, Emily Shearer, and Rachel Sorna turned in a one-two-three finish for the Big Red. Yale, which was dominant against the Crimson at their annual dual meet early in the season, finished behind Harvard in fifth place with 108 points.
On the men’s side, the Crimson started off the race in impressive fashion but failed to seal the victory. After a blistering start, Harvard was leading in the team standings at the two-mile mark, with each of its top five runners in top-20 positions.
“I’d much rather see our guys laying it all out there and really going for it than the alternative,” Saretsky said. “I’d rather go for the win than settle for third or fourth or something like that.”
Junior James Leakos was the Crimson’s top finisher, coming in 19th place. Leakos finished 35 seconds behind the leader—Princeton’s Chris Bendtsen—running the men’s eight-kilometer course in 24:16.
Leakos was in the lead pack until late in the race on Saturday. He and Bendtsen were vying for the lead and had created separation from the rest of the field with 600 meters to go when he “hit the wall” and fell back to his eventual place.
“I’m really proud of how [Leakos] competed,” Saretsky said. “He left it all out there.”
Harvard’s other usual frontrunner, junior Maksim Korolev, was not far behind, finishing in 24:24 to take home 22nd place.
Freshmen Tom Purnell and Billy Gaudreau and junior Kurt Ruegg also contributed to the Crimson’s point total of 131.
Purnell and Gaudreau continued their impressive freshman campaigns, as they both broke the 25-minute mark.
“[Purnell and Gaudreau] have done a remarkable job handling the difficult transition to college,” Saretsky said. “They’re only going to continue to get better. Their future is incredibly bright.”
Princeton earned its third consecutive Ivy League title, upsetting No. 10 Columbia in decisive fashion, 26-58. Bendtsen was one of four Tigers runners to finish in the top 10 on Saturday. The team’s first six runners all finished ahead of Leakos.
“You’ve got to tip your hat to Princeton,” Saretsky said. “They did a fantastic job on the men’s side. All seven of their guys will be back, so they’ll have a big target on their back next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its penultimate tournament of the semester, the Harvard men’s tennis team swept the singles A draw at the Harvard Halloween Classic. Sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri led the team with a victory over Crimson freshman Kelvin Lam in the finals.
The semifinals featured four Harvard players in total, with co-captain Andy Nguyen and sophomore Alex Steinroeder bowing out to Lam and Chaudhuri, respectively.
Chaudhuri teamed up with sophomore Henry Steer to win the doubles B draw, scoring an 8-4 win in the finals over the team from Army University.
In the doubles A draw, Lam and partner sophomore Denis Nguyen won the tournament after a 9-8 (7-2) triumph over Lucas Da Silveira and Justin To from Brown.
Lam and Nguyen saved a match point at 7-8 after Lam fought off three Brown lobs and put away a smash past the diving Da Silveira.
“I think everyone played well this weekend,” coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “[Sophomore] Brendan Seaver had a good win that was as big as he has had since he got here. Alex and Henry are coming back from injuries and it was great to see them playing again.”
In the final, Chaudhuri quickly went up 4-0 against Lam, who committed six backhand errors in a stretch of seven points.
Chaudhuri served out the set, but was broken early in the second as Lam took a quick 2-0 lead.
But Chaudhuri broke Lam twice in succession and regained a 3-2 lead that he served out to take the second set, 6-4. Lam went two for nine on break points in the match.
Andy Nguyen, who was seeded first in the A draw, fell to Lam, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 2-6, in the semifinals after taking a set and leading 2-1 in the second. Lam broke Nguyen late in the second and in the third set took an early lead with two early breaks.
Nguyen had a three-set singles victory earlier in the day, and Fish said the amount of play was unusual for a college match, where players are usually expected to just play one doubles match and one singles match. Nguyen played a combined four matches on the day, splitting both his singles and doubles matches.
“In college matches, you usually don’t have to play six sets and that’s up to five, six hours of tennis,” Fish explained. “The guy he beat in the first round from Amherst [Mark Kahan], beat our number one last year [Jonathan Pearlman] and that’s a good win for Andy.”
Nguyen is one of two upperclassmen on the team, along with junior Casey MacMaster.
On a squad that is very young, Fish said that Nguyen has really stepped forward to help lead the team.
“Our two co-captains are doing a great job this year,” Fish said. “Seniors have a lot on their minds during the fall semester, and he hasn’t only been saying the right things, he’s been backing it up with his play on the court. He’s added to his game every year, and he’s a real formidable opponent out there.”
Denis Nguyen, who won two matches with Lam at the ITA Northeast Regionals tournament two weeks ago, said that the doubles team came out strong from the beginning of the tournament and stayed focused throughout.
“We were able to keep our energy up throughout the tournament,” Nguyen said. “We took every match with a very professional attitude and competed well from the start. We’re both really small, but we’re really quick with really good hands and we are able to use that to your advantage.”
The team has one tournament left, which takes place at William and Mary on Nov. 9-11, before breaking until spring semester.
As the Crimson won the Ivy League championships last year, Nguyen said that Harvard will have a target on its back come league play.
“In the fall, we are trying to get in a lot of matches and build up some confidence,” Nguyen said. “We are trying to get ready for the spring season, and a lot of teams are going to be gunning for us since we won it all last year. We have to be prepared for that moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second year in a row, the Harvard men’s lightweights swept past the field for wins in the varsity eights and fours races at Sunday’s Princeton 3-Mile Chase at Lake Carnegie.
Just a week after its triumph at the Head of the Charles, the first varsity eight finished at the top of the pack, edging Yale by just under two seconds. Meanwhile, the second four surprised the competition with a six-second margin win over the Bulldogs’ first four.
With senior Austin Meyer in stroke, junior Michael Wales in three, senior Stuart Taylor in two, sophomore Andrew Campbell in bow, and senior Alex Saal as coxswain, the winning Crimson four was rife with experience. All five athletes competed earlier in the day as part of the first eight and returned to Lake Carnegie in the afternoon for the varsity four race.
“It was tough coming back from a full burn in the eight and hopping in the fours,” Campbell said. “We were definitely feeling our legs going down to the starting line, [but] crossing the starting line and getting onto the course, we snapped right into form.”
The boat was 12th in the starting order, but found itself surpassing several preceding crews.
“It was nice to have those other crews to push us down the race course,” Campbell said.
The crew completed the 2.75-mile course in 13:58.097, the only sub-14 minute finish. Yale trailed, finishing in 14:04.011, while Princeton lagged in third with a time of 14:16.466.
“The boat was running really well,” Campbell said. “We had it going nice and light and then coming around the turn, about two-and-a-half [kilometers] into the race we really picked it up and got some good speed into the finish.”
The first four placed fifth behind Yale’s second boat. Harvard’s third and fourth boats finished 11th and 12th, respectively, in the pack of 30 entries.
In the varsity eight race, the Crimson’s first eight was the first to start. The race took place mid-morning, just as unpredictable winds began to hit the Mid-Atlantic.
“It was definitely an interesting race for us because the way the wind worked was that you didn’t really get much practice in the tailwind before the race,” said senior three-seat Erich Schultze. “We did all our practice strokes in the headwind and then we’re expected to just turn around and go right on the course in different wind conditions. It’s just really hard to do.”
Despite the weather, the crew cruised to another victory, its second straight in two weeks. Harvard finished in 12:35.609, outpacing Yale by 1.85 seconds. The hometown Tigers, in a repeat of last week’s show at Head of the Charles, came in third, over ten seconds behind the Bulldogs with a finish of 12:48.561.
“I’m proud of the guys,” Schultze said. “We had a really aggressive piece. We started out hard and I think it’s always hard to win races.”
The second eight finished eighth overall out of 27 crews. Their time of 13:06.209 put them right between the first boats from Navy and Pennsylvania.
“I think today Yale was two seconds off of us after being a little further back,” Schultze said. “That just goes to show you the quality of the athletes we’re going up against. We’re fortunate to have had the fall that we did, and we’re excited going into winter training.”
In the freshman race, the two Crimson boats placed 16th and 24th. The entries were mixed heavy and lightweights. In the field of lightweights, the Harvard squads were eighth and 12th.
“This is a very talented and experienced group of guys right now, [but] the eight is nowhere near its full potential,” said Campbell, who sat in the five-seat of the first eight. “When we come together as a crew I think the results are going to be devastating like a hurricane.”
Campbell returns to Harvard after a year off spent training on the international scene.
“I’m excited to keep going with this crew,” Campbell said. “I spent the last year rowing in much smaller crews. I’ll have to say that it is definitely a lot more fun and lot more gratifying to win alongside eight of your best friends than it is to win alone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team kicked off postseason play at the third-annual Ivy Championships at Yale’s Kiphuth Pool this weekend, falling in the semifinals to Brown, 19-5, on Sunday.
On Saturday, Harvard (13-15, 4-2 CWPA) rolled to a comfortable victory over Penn’s club team, 21-15, to advance to Sunday’s semifinals against the No. 12 Bears (25-2, 6-0).
Following the Crimson’s loss to Brown, the tournament’s final and consolation final were cancelled due to the area’s impending storm.
The tournament, which featured three varsity teams and five club teams from Ivy League schools, served as an unofficial Ancient Eight championship. The Crimson joined Princeton and Brown as varsity water polo ambassadors.
“I think the best thing about this weekend was promoting water polo to the rest of the Ivy League and giving those club teams the opportunity to play against the varsity teams,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said.
The Ivy Championships served as the Crimson’s final test before next weekend’s Northern Championships at Brown. There, Harvard must defeat Fordham on Saturday in order to qualify for the Princeton-hosted CWPA Eastern Championships on Nov. 16-18, which would serve as the Crimson’s season finale.
“What we took from [this tournament] was more practice and preparation for our game against Fordham,” junior attacker Will Roller said. “That’s really what it boils down to; that’s where our head’s been for the past week.”
Hurricane Sandy forced event organizers to cancel the Ivy Championship final between Brown and No. 18 Princeton, which was scheduled for Sunday evening. Harvard would have played Dartmouth’s club team in the consolation final.
BROWN 19, HARVARD 5
Brown routed Harvard on both sides of the ball early to take a commanding 8-0 lead into the second quarter Saturday morning. The Bears proceeded to outscore the Crimson in the final three frames as well, cruising to a 19-5 win.
“They’re a very intense team,” Roller said of Brown. “I think many of these nationally ranked teams really do have this sort of swagger, if you will, that translates into that intensity in the pool.”
Junior Jimmy Field led the Crimson in scoring with a hat trick, trading his regular position in goal to help fill in on the attack as Minnis rested ailing attackers.
“It’s that time of year when you get dinged up, and you’re going to be sore,” Minnis said. “We’ve got a few injuries, but I think the great thing about this team is that they don’t make any excuses. The next guy up is the next guy in, and they really believe that.”
“We were out there looking to play a good game but also maintain the health of our team,” Roller added.
On defense, Field, Roller and freshman attackers Blake Lee and Austen Novis each had two steals. Freshman goalie Colin Woolway made 10 saves.
The Crimson is now 0-2 versus Brown this year. The Bears defeated Harvard, 23-9, at Blodgett Pool on Oct. 11.
HARVARD 21, PENN 15
The Crimson stormed out to a 7-1 lead in the first quarter to put the game out of reach for the Quaker club team Saturday afternoon. Although Penn played even with Harvard for the final three periods, the Quakers could not match the Crimson’s season-high 21 goals.
“[Saturday’s game] was really about executing our game plan and just playing a perfect game in the sense that we’re not making errors and capitalizing upon [Penn’s errors]. I think we did a good job of capitalizing on their errors, but we did get a little soft or complacent on the defensive end,” Roller said. “They scored a few more goals than we would have liked.”
After falling behind by six goals in the first quarter, Penn crept within four with a 4-2 run in the second. But that was the closest the Quakers got to Harvard as the Crimson outscored Penn by one goal in each of the final two frames to clinch the 21-15 win and a spot in the tournament’s semifinal.
Roller led all scorers with a career-high five goals. Freshman attacker Robbie Fluegge also established a career-high with four, and freshmen attackers Ben Zepfel and Lee contributed a pair of hat tricks. On defense, Fluegge and sophomore utility Thomas McNulty led the Crimson with four and three steals, respectively. Field and Woolway combined for eight saves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Defense wasn’t enough for the Harvard women’s soccer team, which dropped its final road game of the season, 2-0, on Sunday afternoon at Dartmouth.
Despite a strong defensive showing, the Crimson (8-5-3, 2-3-1 Ivy) was outmatched offensively, taking only one shot to Dartmouth’s 18. Big Green sophomore forward Tasha Wilkins led the way for Dartmouth (12-4, 5-1 Ivy), netting her fourth and fifth goals of the season.
“It was a tough loss, but I think that we really put it all out there,” junior forward Elizabeth Weisman said. “Dartmouth, on [Sunday], was a better team than we were.”
It was the Big Green’s Homecoming Weekend, and with the win Dartmouth moved into second place in the Ivy League behind Princeton with one game to play.
“Dartmouth had a lot to play for,” said junior co-captain and midfielder Peyton Johnson. “Unfortunately, we left it to ourselves to have to respond and not initiate the game tempo, which put us in a tough spot for the second half.”
The Big Green was frustrated in front of the goal throughout the first half and into the second, taking 12 shots before Wilkins found the back of the net in the 75th minute off a pass from senior midfielder Emma Brush.
Ten minutes later, Wilkins powered a long-range shot at sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten, who could not hold on, and Dartmouth went up 2-0.
“It was pretty even throughout the entire game until the end,” Weisman said.
After opening the game with three shots in the first seven minutes, the Big Green was unable to get past the Harvard defense and the first half ended in a scoreless tie.
“In the second half, it became more fifty-fifty, and we still managed to fend them off,” Johnson said. “Bethany Kanten did good keeping the shutout for as long as she did. They had some really great chances, and she came up huge.”
Kanten played all 90 minutes in goal and notched seven saves, nearly doubling her season average of 3.6 saves per game. She also took the Crimson’s lone shot on goal, a free-kick in the 83rd minute that gave Dartmouth goalkeeper Tatiana Saunders her only save of the night.
“The first ten minutes, we didn’t set the tone like we had wanted,” Johnson said. “That left us in a tough position having to respond.”
Despite a slow start, possession remained fairly even throughout the rest of the game. And although it was outmatched in shots on goal, nine to one, Harvard’s offense created opportunities but failed to finish.
“We had a couple of opportunities, but we didn’t really settle the ball, so it was hard to get some of the chances that we usually get,” Weisman said. “Our offense was doing well, but we weren’t playing the way that we usually do.”
The Big Green held the edge in corner kicks, earning four to the Crimson’s two.
The loss marked only the second time this season that Harvard was shut out. Despite averaging 16 shots per game on the year, the Crimson’s offense failed to make opportunities late in the game and had no chances to come back from the 2-0 deficit.
In Dartmouth’s sixth shutout win of the season, the Big Green defense controlled the pace of the game and the space in front of its goal.
“We let Dartmouth set the rhythm of the game for quite a while, which definitely impacted the way we were able to attack,” Johnson said. “They didn’t allow us to play our own style of offense.  They defended hard, and credit to their defense and goalkeeper for keeping us shut out.”
With the loss, Harvard fell to fourth place in the Ancient Eight. Despite having no chance to repeat as Ivy League champions, the team is looking forward to its final game of the season.
“It’s awesome that after a tough game like this one, we still have one more chance to show what we are made of going into the spring and next season,” Johnson said. “We will be practicing the mentality of coming out and making the other team respond to us instead of the other way around.”

Three days ago, the Obama campaign released a video titled "Your First Time"—your first time voting, of course. You've probably already seen it. The video elicited many different reactions, some of which are cropping up at Harvard as well.
In the video endorsement, actress and filmmaker Lena Dunham begins with a statement that raises eyebrows, saying: "Your first time shouldn't be with just anybody. You want to do it with a great guy. Someone who really cares about and understands women."
But when she suddenly starts talking about making sure we "do it with a guy who brought the troops out of Iraq," the video's connection to Obama suddenly starts to make a little more sense.
As an artist whose work openly talks about topics like sex, femininity, and body image, Dunham’s intent seems clear: young women, go out and vote.
Her sexual undertone, however, has sparked several negative reactions. Picked up by various newspapers and blogs, the video has come under intense scrutiny, including being called "utterly sexist" by the Independent Women's Forum.
At Harvard, Dunham's video has also raised concern among the members of The Harvard Anscombe Society, a student organization that prides itself on its positions on abstinence from sex before marriage and "true feminism."
President Luciana E. Milano '14 published a blog post Sunday afternoon titled "Obama's Trivialization of Virginity," criticizing the campaign for "[drawing] an offensive and distasteful parallel between losing one’s virginity and the 'awesome' experience of voting for Mr. Obama."
Milano went on to say that the ad "hyper-sexualizes women and treats chastity as a quaint concept."
Meanwhile, liberal blogs say that conservatives are over-reacting. Blackbookmag.com, for instance, published an article titled "Lena Dunham Proves No One Has A Sense of Humor Anymore."
Dunham herself seems to care little: "I voted for Barack Obama," she ends the video with a grin.

Last Saturday, Harvard students launched the first burger into space.
 
"Some friends and I were sitting together and wanting to do something different," said Nuseir Yassin '14, who put the project together along with four other Harvard students. 
In a bout of mischievous contemplation, they decided to send a b.good burger where no burger has gone before. When asked about the project, Yassin laughed and described how they launched a weather balloon equipped with a tracker, a camera, and a burger on a pedestal 100,000 feet up into the air.
"The whole point was to take a picture of the curvature of the Earth and space and put the burger inside it," said Yassin. 
 After a successful mission, the contraption unfortunately got stuck in a tree and has thus far been irretrievable.
"We hope Sandy will take care of it for us," said Yassin.
 
Yassin plans to upload a YouTube video showing the preparation and footage of the trip if the camera can be retrieved. b.good, a local burger chain, was remarkably enthusiastic in its support.
In an email to Yassin, b.good representatives said, "There's no way we'd miss the shot at launching some of our locally-raised, house-ground goodness into orbit."
 
In response to a question on b.good's Facebook page about who gets to eat the burger, Yassin laughed. "The burger has been slightly modified, but you can tell readers it will be on display in Harvard Square's b.good," he said.

While you spent the day in pajamas scrolling through your newsfeed thinking about all the homework you should be doing, Harvard University Dining Services went about their business as usual, grilling your veggie burgers and dishing out quinoa. When all of Harvard shut down for the third time in its entire history, HUDS was one of the few staff services that did not get to stay home. For their hard work, students and staff decided to show their gratitude through a standing ovation.
 
The motion of thanks was a stroke of genius from Wigglesworth I-entryway proctor Jennifer Haugh. Her idea was circulated via Facebook, text messages, and House lists and a time and location was set for the standing ovation: Annenberg, 6:30 p.m.
 
"There are a lot of students, and it's hard to think of ways to appreciate everybody," Haugh said. "It struck me—why not something big like a standing ovation?"
 
The standing ovation was not limited to Annenberg; HUDS workers were thanked in upperclassmen dining halls like Kirkland, Eliot, Winthrop, and Adams, and other Houses decorated signs and made other gestures of gratitude.
 
When informed that her idea had spread like wildfire through electronic communication around campus, Haugh said, "It's pretty amazing when you think about it. All you need to do is come up with a good idea and two hours later everyone in campus is in on it. There are a lot of people in the dining services who use public transportation to get home, and I just hope they get home safely."
 
Students were similarly grateful for an opportunity to thank HUDS. 
 
"I think it was really cool of everyone to appreciate the people who had to come because the weather was poor," said Fola A. Sofela '16. 
 
The hurricane provided students with an opportunity not only to catch up on work and sleep, but to look around and thank the many people that keep Harvard up and running, even in the event of a natural disaster.
