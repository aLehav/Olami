After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 10:49 p.m.
Anne H. Margulies, the State of Massachusetts' head information technology officer, will return to Harvard in early September to assume the post of Chief Information Officer, the University announced Monday.
Currently the assistant secretary for information technology and the Chief Information Officer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Margulies will be returning to Harvard already equipped with extensive knowledge of the University's information technology services.
Margulies first joined Harvard in 1986 to oversee the construction of the University’s telephone and data communications network, a project that involved the rewiring of more than 200 buildings over the course of five years. When appointed to the newly created position of assistant provost and executive director for information systems in 1995, Margulies restructured the Office of Information Technology into the University Information Systems department in response to financial issues and concerns regarding the level of service provided by the OIT.
A significant element of Margulies' new role as CIO is to facilitate the integration of University Information Systems commodity services with Faculty of Arts and Sciences information technology, "in the spirit of collaboration and challenging financial times," according to the UIS website.
“This is a critical piece of our effort to better organize and utilize  University resources and create efficiencies across campus,” University Executive Vice President Katherine  N. Lapp told The Harvard Gazette. “These two  IT departments have developed separately over time, and it only makes  sense to ensure that they are working in concert.”
With more than 30 years of experience in information technology, administrative leadership, and strategic planning under her belt, Margulies will be filling the vacancy left by Daniel D. Moriarty, who resigned in late 2009 and did not provide a reason for the move at the time. His deputy, Susan Walsh, who is also head of UIS, has served the interim position since Moriarty's departure.
"From my discussions with many faculty and senior leaders across Harvard, it is clear that the University is ready to chart a new course for its own IT future," Margulies told the Gazette. "I am very excited about the opportunity to work with faculty, students, and staff to formulate an innovative vision for IT that is right for Harvard, and to make it a reality."
In 1998, Margulies left her position at Harvard to become the executive  vice president for McDermott/O’Neill and Associates, a public relations  and strategic communications firm in Boston. She then became the first  executive director of the OpenCourseWare initiative, a web-based publication of MIT course content in 2002,  before assuming her current post with the state.
"She was able to unify a large, scattered IT staff, and helped them create a single community, articulate a vision, and plan concrete steps to achieve it," wrote Linda Hamel, general council and colleague of Margulies, in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson. She’s a very bright person with a strong work ethic and a laser sharp view of large, complex organizations. I’ll miss her sense of humor!"
Noah S. Selsby, FAS senior client technology advisor, said that he is excited about the news of Margulies' appointment and looks forward to working with her.
"I was privileged to be able to meet her during the search process and was very impressed with her previous accomplishments at MIT and the Commonwealth, as well as her knowledge of Harvard," Selsby said. "I’m very confident that she is the right choice for such a complex position."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three years away from the place where he got his start coaching, Chris Wojcik ‘96 will finally return to Harvard.
Athletics director Bob Scalise announced Monday that Wojcik—a former two-sport athlete and assistant coach for the Crimson—will serve as the new men’s lacrosse coach after John Tillman vacated the position in mid-June to take the head coaching job at Maryland.
“I’m very excited to return to Harvard as head coach,” Wojcik said. “It’s just a great opportunity to come back to my alma mater. It’s been a dream come true…I hoped at some point down the road that I was going to be the head coach at Harvard.”
Although Wojcik lacks head coaching experience, the former All-Ivy selection in lacrosse and soccer is no stranger to the Ancient Eight.
Wojcik joins Harvard after serving for two seasons as the top lacrosse assistant at Penn, where he was responsible for coordinating both the team’s recruiting and offense.
While with Penn, Wojcik helped coach the Quakers to a 10-16 record, including a 12-7 win over the Crimson last April. But perhaps Wojcik’s biggest contribution to Penn was in recruiting, where he landed the Quakers’ Drew Belinsky and Brian Feeney—both Under Armor All-Americans—for the upcoming season.
Yet while Wojcik may have found success in Philadelphia, he owes his start in coaching to Harvard. After graduating in 1996 with the William J. Bingham Award—given to the Crimson’s top male athlete—Wojcik spent seven years playing professional soccer and lacrosse before returning to serve as an assistant on the Harvard men’s lacrosse team for the 2003 season.
During the tenure of former head coach Scott Anderson, Wojcik worked for five seasons as an assistant, spending time as the team’s offensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator. When Anderson stepped down in 2007, Wojcik was interested in filling the vacancy. But the job went to Tillman, and Wojcik was forced to look elsewhere.
“I was certainly disappointed, but I also knew that there were things I needed to do to get the job next time and be the best possible coach I could be for the kids,” Wojcik said.
One of those things Wojcik felt he needed to do was to learn new coaching philosophies—something he hoped to achieve by working for a different program.
The Crimson alum ended up at Bowdoin, where he served for one season as an assistant before moving back to the Ivy League to work with Penn.
And this year, after spending two seasons under Penn coach Mike Murphy, Wojcik finally has the opportunity to serve as head coach of the program that gave him his start.
Wojcik takes over a Crimson team that failed to live up to its high expectations a season ago. After entering the spring ranked No. 12 in the country, Harvard faltered in conference play, finishing 2-4 and missing out on the inaugural four-team Ancient Eight tournament.
Harvard hopes that by hiring someone with as much Ivy League experience as Wojcik, the Crimson’s fate in conference play is destined to change.
“We are extremely delighted to welcome Chris as our new head men’s lacrosse coach,” Scalise said, according to gocrimson.com. “Chris is a tremendous recruiter, a superb offensive strategist, and his familiarity with the Ivy League will help our program succeed, both on a regional and a national level. As a Harvard alumnus and former captain of our program, Chris is dedicated to continue building a winning tradition here in Cambridge.”
Since he was hired, Wojcik has been contacting the Crimson players and explaining to them his plans and vision for Harvard lacrosse.
One potential change Wojcik plans to implement is to speed up the style of play.
“I’m probably looking to play a more up-tempo, more transition-oriented style of lacrosse,” Wojcik said. “The plan is to be the best that we can be and build a long-term winning program.”
Wojcik is the third head coach hired by Harvard this summer, none with more than three months’ experience as a head coach at the collegiate level. The new men’s and women’s water polo coach, Ted Minnis, comes to Cambridge after serving as head coach at the Castilleja School in California. Carl Junot, who was announced as the men’s soccer coach last week, served for over two months as the head coach at Tufts from this past April until June.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Columbia baseball fans are a tough crowd to please. When Columbia Spectator writers Jacob and Michael Shapiro reported on the Lions’ loss in the Ivy League championship a couple weeks back, Columbia fans were far from happy with the negative tone of the article, commenting, “what the hell, bros? try putting a positive spin on something for once” and “Surprise! The brothers Shapiro combine on a horrible article, weird.” In an effort to avoid being verbally accosted in a similar fashion, this edition of Around the Water Cooler has nothing but positive things to say about the Lions baseball club. We will also explore the strange culture of our northern comrades over at Dartmouth, as well as the all-important topic of Ivy League basketball.
This has been a year to remember for fans of Ivy League basketball. The clock may have already struck midnight nearly fourth months ago for the Cinderella-like Cornell men’s basketball team in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament, but the good times keep rolling for the players still in the game. Four Ivy League graduates are currently showcasing their skills at the 2010 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas (and maybe doing some other things, too—but hey, who are we to judge?):  Harvard’s Jeremy Lin ’10 and Brian Cusworth ’07; Cornell’s Ryan Wittman ’10; and Penn’s Ibrahim Jaaber ’07.
So far, the two point guards, Jaaber and Lin, have been leading the pack with some impressive stats. Running the offense for the Los Angeles Lakers, Jaaber is averaging 5.0 points and 4.3 assists per game. Meanwhile, Lin—who has surpassed Yo-Yo Ma as the most popular Asian American—has come off the bench for the Dallas Mavericks and averaged 8.0 points, 2.0 assists, and 2.3 rebounds. (And, as history has already shown, Lin continues to be plagued by turnovers, averaging 3.3 per game.) Those numbers are a far cry from the 15.9 points and 5.2 assists Jaaber averaged as a senior with the Quakers, and the 16.4 points and 4.4 assists Lin averaged last year with the Crimson, but I guess trying to get past former UNC standout Ty Lawson is a tad harder than beating Brown guard Adrian Williams.
Wittman has been averaging four points a game for the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks this summer. With that in mind, we have a feeling that he won’t be holding an hour-long special on Cornell’s Slope TV at the conclusion of summer league to announce his illustrious future in the NBA.
Anyway, it’s time to appease Columbia’s baseball fans. Lions’ sluggers Jason Banos and Mark Heil have been tearing it up for their summer league baseball teams. Banos—who batted .301 with 34 RBI for Columbia last season—was selected to participate in the New England Collegiate Baseball League All-Star Game this Sunday after having hit .329 through 20 games for the North Shore Navigators. Heil will take the field tonight in the Southern Collegiate Baseball League All-Star Game. While he didn’t see much action for Columbia last season (his only RBI came against—you guessed it—Harvard in the Lions 24-1 win over the Crimson), he has been making up for lost time this summer, batting .345 with a .438 on base percentage.
We all know that Dartmouth likes to do things, well, a bit differently. For example, in a stark departure from the usual alcohol-related practices that dominate the college scene, Dartmouth’s version of beer pong involves paddles. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Big Green’s skiing team had more victories this past season than Dartmouth’s football team has had in the past three seasons. It’s no wonder then that the Big Green would be able to land a former Olympian, Chip Knight, as their new women’s alpine coach.
Oh and for the Brown sports fans out there—four or five of you must exist—we promise that as soon as some real news (seriously, anything more interesting than the announcement of the new women’s soccer freshman class) comes out of Providence, we'll be sure to tell you about it.
