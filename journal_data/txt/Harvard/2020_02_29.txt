After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite leading Columbia for the majority of Friday night’s game, Harvard suffered a stinging loss to the Lions, who prevailed by a score of 62-57.
In its five-point defeat to Columbia, the Crimson extended its losing streak to four games, dropped to below .500 in Ivy League play, and endangered its chances at clinching a spot in the Ivy League Tournament, which Harvard will host in March.
Crimson players had plans going into Friday night’s game against the Lions, who trounced Harvard by 25 points in New York City earlier this month — dealing the Crimson its worst blow in conference play this season.
Freshman guard Lola Mullaney said she and her teammates were eager to return the favor to their Columbia opponents when the two teams faced off again. She said they prepared intensely in advance of Friday’s match-up.
“We were definitely excited because we were mad about the first time around when we played them,” she said. “Everyone was getting in the gym, getting up extra shots. And I think that showed in the beginning.”
In the first frame of Friday’s game, a Crimson victory looked likely.
Thanks to sharp downtown shooting from Mullaney and sophomore guard Tess Sussman, Harvard led the Lions by a score of 34-27 going into halftime. Sussman scored an efficient 17 points in Friday night’s game, shooting nearly 67 percent from the field and swishing four triples. Mullaney, who finished Friday’s game with 20 points, had a comfortable 13 points in the first half, which already surpassed her 12 point performance against Columbia earlier this month.
On the defensive end, Harvard held Columbia’s freshman guard Abbey Hsu to just one basket in the first half. Hsu dropped a career-high 31 points against the Crimson in the teams’ initial match-up this season. 
Hsu would not stay quiet for long, however.
In the third quarter, Columbia steadily erased its deficit by increasing its intensity on both ends of the floor. On defense, Columbia came out in a full court press that tricked Harvard’s guards into walking into traps at half court. Taking advantage of Crimson turnovers, the Lions’ guards pushed the ball on offense and scored in transition, demonstrating creativity and care with the basketball.
Columbia’s fast-paced play forced the Crimson into a state of chaos and brought the game within one point heading into the final quarter.
And then, with the game tied at 50, Hsu made two consecutive plays that determined the fate of Friday’s competition. She drilled a pair of back-to-back three pointers from the right wing that iced the Lions’ second victory over the Crimson this season.
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said she considered those six points to be the nail in the Crimson’s coffin against Columbia.
“We made two huge errors at the end of the game that I think cost us the game and it was letting [No.] 35 [Hsu] shoot those threes,” she said.
Harvard currently sits in fifth place in the Ivy League conference, which only sends its top four teams to the Ivy League Tournament. Held in Cambridge next month, the tournament will decide which Ancient Eight team gets to dance its way to the NCAA Tournament.
Delaney-Smith said she told her players after Friday night’s loss to keep fighting.
“I just said I'm counting on you to be resilient and strong and get ready for tomorrow night,” she said. “And it's not over till the fat lady sings and it’s not over. The fat lady’s not even in the room yet.”
Mullaney said Delaney-Smith’s post-game remarks resonated with her.
“We're definitely a team that's not just going to give up,” she said.
Harvard will play its last home game of the regular season against Cornell at Lavietes Pavilion tomorrow evening. Tip off is slated for 5 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ball hit the rim and play continued as Columbia’s Ike Nweke snagged the rebound and pushed it the other way. Yet senior guard Christian Juzang, just missing the attempt, remained. Laying down and grimacing with pain, the Tarzana, California native clutched his ankle with his hands. Shortly after a foul stopped play, coaches and managers rushed onto the court to see what went wrong. It was clear he could not continue. Juzang, who has excelled in stepping into the role of team leader this season, was gone. Somebody else had to step in.
With their past three meetings extending into overtime, Harvard could not seem to shake off Columbia regardless of the Lions’ ranking in the Ivy League. Heading into Saturday, the Lions were last in the conference, defeating only Cornell before going on a ten-game losing streak. Nevertheless, the Crimson’s tendency to play close games this year made expectations no different for the matchup between the two-seed and the eight-seed.
It took fifty minutes the first time these two teams met this season for Harvard to pull away, as senior guard Mike Smith exploded for 37 points to keep the Lions’ hope for a second conference win alive. To prevent another dominant performance by Smith, coach Tommy Amaker matched Justin Bassey with Columbia’s scoring leader to start the game. Bassey’s relentless defense to start the game clearly bothered Smith, who opened shooting three-for-eight, forcing up shots in an attempt to get a rhythm going.
Whenever Bassey would head for the bench, junior guard Rio Haskett took his place defensively, consistently denying Smith the ball and keeping position in front of him whenever the Illinois native looked to attack. The nation’s eighth-leading scorer was held to eight points in the first half, eleven less than his first-half output two weeks ago.
Smith wasn’t the only struggling offensively in the first frame of play, however. It seemed like the three-point shooting trend from the two teams’ first meeting, where the Crimson made eight of 43 attempts, carried over to Levien Gymnasium. Harvard opened the game shooting two for 14 from behind the arc and the Lions hit only three of 11 three point attempts in the first twenty minutes of play.
Looking to get going offensively, Amaker’s emphasis on “bench and balance” was seen early, with substitutes contributing to sixteen of the team’s 32 first-half points. Sophomore Mason Forbes contributed back-to-back baskets as soon as he entered the game, adding two free throws to finish the game with six points. Chris Ledlum had a slow offensive start to the night with three points in the first half but made up for it on the defensive end, coming up with four rebounds and an emphatic chase-down block on Mike Smith’s fast-break layup attempt.
For Ledlum and fellow freshman Idan Tretout, tonight’s game held particularly more importance than for the rest of the team. It was a homecoming for the two New York natives, returning to the city and to Levien Gymnasium after playing there this past summer in the Pro City Basketball League. The two were met by friends and family who packed the stands, holding Fatheads of Tretout’s face and cheering both on when they stepped onto the court in the first half.
As the half progressed and the bench began to contribute to the game, the Crimson fell into a rhythm: holding the Lions to a scoring drought and putting together short runs to extend the lead to five. Things seemed to be going smoothly, with Harvard only looking to turn up the intensity in the second half. With 50 seconds to go in the half, Juzang would attempt his last shot of the game, landing awkwardly before being helped off the court by his teammates.
With the second half starting, Harvard had to find someone else to step up as a leader.
“Our guys are all understanding that we are on to the next play and the next guy,” Amaker said. “That’s because of us playing with a lot of different guys throughout the course of the season.”
From the start of the half, however, they looked like a different team. Five straight Crimson turnovers led to a 8-0 Columbia run in 90 seconds, tying the game at 37. To make matters even worse, Columbia’s Mike Smith--who was thought to have been contained in the first half--was merely waiting for the second half to get started. Smith scored the Lions’ first 14 points to open the half, hoping to capitalize on the Crimson’s unfortunate situation. He would go on to score 12 more points in the half, ending with 34 on the night.
The Crimson quickly had to find a response to maintain their lead. Juzang, sitting on the bench with ice on his foot extending to the last few seats, nevertheless had his head in the game. He would get up on crutches during timeouts and make his way behind the bench to give advice to players getting some rest time before heading back in. A vocal leader on the court was still missing, however.
Embodying the “next man up” mentality, Rio Haskett stepped right in and made it his responsibility to navigate the offense. The junior would go bucket-for-bucket with Smith, unleashing tears where it seemed like no defender on the court could contain him. On the other side of the floor, his hustle created Columbia turnovers that would ultimately keep them from making another major run. An array of three pointers, layups, and floaters all added up to his fifteen points in the second half, contributing to a career-high 19 on the night on 8-10 shooting.
“First priority was picking up where we left off on defense,” said Haskett. “Once I did that, I kind of got into a rhythm where I was able to take advantage of them in transition.”
To complement Haskett, the hometown hero Chris Ledlum would put up 12 points in the second half himself, helping create an 11 point cushion with just under two minutes to go. Although he was playing in his hometown for the first time in his young college career, he did not let the stage get to his head.
“I was concerned about the energy and all that brings for a young player,” said Amaker. “I thought he handled it great.”
Bassey’s 12 points and eleven rebounds on the night summarized his impact on both ends of the floor, helping end the streak of overtime games with Columbia. Chris Lewis continued his impressive offensive season, scoring in double digits yet again in what seems to be a regular occurrence now.
Despite Mike Smith’s impressive offensive display, the rest of the team’s lack of support made another tight contest between the two sides more difficult. The total team effort by the Crimson led them to pulling away 77-69 to earn a win on the first leg of their New York trip.
“One of coach’s big things is ‘stay ready so you don’t have to get ready',” Ledlum said. “Everyone on the team stepped up.”
Harvard remains the second seed in the Ivy League after Yale’s stunning comeback against Penn tonight. With three games remaining before the Ivy League tournament, the Crimson look to make a jump to the number one seed to have the best possible chance at going dancing in March.
This push for the Ivy League title will continue tomorrow, as the Crimson face against Cornell in Ithaca. Tip off is at 6 pm in Newman Arena.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the overtime session, Harvard funneled many chances to the net. The Crimson forced Yale junior goaltender Gianna Meloni to make a couple of semi-breakaway saves, outshot the Bulldogs 7-3, and earned a power play as well. Nonetheless, Yale (17-14-0, 13-9-0 ECAC) withstood the pressure and found a game-winning goal from junior forward Tess Dettling on a backdoor feed from sophomore forward Claire Dalton. A decisive game three awaits after the Bulldog 4-3 victory.
The drama at the finish matched the back-and-forth of a game in which neither team ever took a two-goal lead. In the first period, Harvard (17-13-1, 15-6-1 ECAC) would jump out to a 1-0 start just as it did yesterday. After drawing a penalty for checking, the Crimson power play went to work, but in a somewhat unconventional way. The Harvard defense allowed a relatively high-percentage high-slot scoring chance, but sophomore goalie Lindsay Reed positioned herself squarely for the save. The long rebound off of Reed’s stick would then act as a breakout pass, initiating the counter-attack. Co-captain and forward Kat Hughes carried the puck as a four-on-one developed. She then found a streaking Becca Gilmore for the backdoor finish just 3:23 into the first period.
Despite the quick start for Harvard, the mid-first period would mark a major momentum change. The Bulldogs found the net twice in just over a minute, 9:36 and 10:53 into the first frame, respectively. The first Bulldog goal, however, would not come without controversy. As junior defender Greta Skarzynski launched a knuckling point blast, the puck wafted through the air and looked to be heading towards the top-shelf. At the last second, however, sophomore forward Charlotte Welch managed to deflect the puck downwards and into the net. Immediately after the puck went in, Reed appealed to the referee—the puck looked as though it could have been batted down with Welch’s hand. The referees did indeed spend a long video review on the goal but confirmed—or at least could not overturn—that the deflection had been legal.
With the game tied, the Bulldogs—and Welch in particular—would parlay the first goal into further momentum. Just 1:17 later, Dalton found space in the Harvard defense and dished to Welch. Welch would make no mistake and delivered the puck into the open net, putting the Bulldogs ahead 2-1.
After heading to the locker room for intermission, however, the Crimson did not waste much time in evening the scoreline. Driving hard to the net, sophomore forward Dominique Petrie narrowly missed a wrap-around attempt. Nonetheless, the puck bounced off of the side of the net and into the prime scoring area in the slot. Meloni was somewhat out of position after defending the wrap-around, and sophomore defender Maryna Macdonald took advantage for Harvard, ripping a slapshot into the open net before Meloni could recover. The Crimson would outshoot the Bulldogs 17-2 in the middle frame, and the sustained pressure paid off at the end of the period just as it had at the beginning. On a four-on-four, at the 17:06 mark of the second period, Kat Hughes would rifle a pass through the Yale defense from behind the net to find cutting sophomore forward Anne Bloomer. Bloomer banged the pass into the far-side of the net on the clean passing play for a 3-2 lead.
With their season on the line in the third period, the Bulldogs started the final frame as the Crimson did the second—quickly. Just 2:32 into the last stanza, a familiar figure struck for Yale: Charlotte Welch. With the puck loose in front of Reed, Welch gained inside position to collect and deposit it into the back of the net, earning her the hat trick. Welch’s third goal would be her last, and the last for either team for the rest of regulation. Welch did stay active in the overtime, however, contributing the secondary assist on the Dettling goal. Dalton’s primary assists on the overtime winner would be her third, giving Yale another “hat trick” of sorts.
Along with the back-and-forth nature of the contest, perhaps one of the most notable game trends was the chippiness. The teams skated four-on-four five times, and Yale’s junior defender Lauren Moriyama took a five-minute major with a 10-minute misconduct. Despite the five minutes in the box, Harvard only took advantage of one minute’s worth of power play. The Crimson took two different minor penalties of its own during the five-minute span, almost entirely negating the advantage. All in all, the teams combined for 15 total penalties worth 41 minutes (27 to Yale and 14 to Harvard).
Beyond the scoring and special teams, Yale also relied on the play of Meloni. As mentioned, she made several critical saves in overtime that preserved not only the game for the Bulldogs but their season as well. Midway through the third period, Meloni also contributed a sliding backdoor save that could have easily been the go-ahead goal for Harvard. By the end of the game, Meloni had registered 43 saves, including 30-plus consecutive saves to end the game after the Crimson had knotted it at two in the early second period.
Everything comes down to tomorrow’s game three. Obviously, the game is a winner-take-all for the series, but beyond that, it is a chance to continue towards an ECAC Championship. Moreover, the winner will keep NCAA Tournament hopes alive while the loser will be almost certainly eliminated. The puck drops at 2:00 p.m. at Bright-Landry Hockey Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Saturday’s regular-season finale, the Harvard men’s hockey team accomplished one of two goals on its agenda. It defeated Union, 4-1, to allow its senior class to celebrate its final home game with a victory.
But the two points over the Dutchmen (7-23-4, 5-15-2) failed to clinch a top-four conference finish for the Crimson (13-10-2, 11-6-5 ECAC). Rensselaer, the other squad vying for the final first-round bye in the ECAC playoffs, shutout Harvard on Friday and earned another win at Dartmouth on Saturday to oust the Crimson’s chances at fourth place.
“It’s definitely some mixed emotions, but it’s good to go out with a win,” Harvard captain Nathan Krusko said. “We still have a lot of business to take care of.”
The Crimson, ranked fifth in the conference, will host St. Lawrence in a best-of-three series in the first round of the ECAC tournament next weekend. The triumph on Saturday marks the sixth straight senior-night win for the Crimson program.
“It’s great to get a win on senior night,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think the whole group wanted to send [the seniors] off on a positive note…. It’s always bittersweet with these end-of-the-year games. You’re so excited looking toward the playoffs, but that last home game for that group of seniors that has given so much to the program is also very special.”
Early in the second period, the Crimson nabbed its first lead of the game — one that would persist until the final buzzer. The centers tied each other up on an offensive-zone faceoff, and forward Austin Wong separated from his defender as he picked up the loose puck. The rookie briefly stick-handled before shelfing a shot from in close.
Wong’s strike was ultimately the decisive one in Saturday’s affair.
Nine minutes later, the Harvard powerplay cashed in for its second of the tilt. Freshman Nick Abruzzese regained possession of the puck in the offensive zone, preventing a Union clear. The winger found sophomore Casey Dornbach through a seam on the unsettled play, and Dornbach did not squander the open-net chance.
The Crimson man-up unit converted again before the night concluded. Sophomore Jack Drury forced home a juicy rebound produced by classmate Jack Rathbone’s point shot.
The powerplay was just one side of Harvard’s impressive special teams performance. A chippy game resulted in numerous trips to the box. As such, the Crimson faced eight Dutchmen powerplays, but killed off all of them including a five-minute major.
“All year, special teams has been a hard emphasis for us,” senior forward Justin Szeto said. “The powerplay has been near the top the entire year, and they pulled through for us today in a big way. And same thing with the kill. A lot of penalties taken, and maybe some calls we didn’t agree with, but when push came to shove, our kill was there, which was huge.”
Both teams found twine in the opening 20 minutes, but the visitors drew first blood. After Union won a puck battle in the corner, freshman Gabriel Seger found classmate Dylan Anhorn unguarded across the slot. The defenseman buried the chance before Harvard net-minder Cameron Gornet (1 GA, .958 SV%) could travel from post to post.
Then came the most pivotal moment of the incipient frame. Drury suffered a nasty hit in the Dutchmen’s zone, and once play was whistled down, coach Donato voiced his displeasure to the officials regarding the dangerous play against his centerpiece forward.
Upon review, the referees retroactively assessed junior rearguard Joseph Campolieto a game misconduct, gifting the nation’s most lethal powerplay a five-minute, non-releasable opportunity.
Half a minute into the man advantage, junior defenseman Reilly Walsh lit the lamp on a one-timer from the point. Rathbone teed up Walsh’s clapper, which zipped over the right shoulder of junior goaltender Darion Hanson (4 GA, .867 SV%).
The major penalty was the turning point of the first stanza, as it allowed the hosts not only to even the ledger but to gain control of play by the period horn. Harvard finished the frame ahead, 12-9, in shots.
“I thought that the first half-dozen minutes looked eerily familiar to our last couple of games,” coach Donato said. “Once we got on the powerplay, it looked like it kind of jumpstarted the group…. At that point, we started to invest in the game a lot more, emotionally and physically.”
Campolieto’s ejection wasn’t the only one on Saturday. With just seconds left in the middle frame, rookie John Farinacci was deemed done for the night due to an elbowing infraction.
Even prior to the line shuffling necessitated by Farinacci’s misconduct, most Crimson forwards were skating on unfamiliar triplets. Following two disappointing results, Harvard jumbled its lines up front on Saturday.
Coach Donato split the lethal top line, opting instead for Wong on the first trio and Dornbach on the second line with Farinacci as his center. Juniors Henry Bowlby and Jack Badini were also disentangled from their usual second-line pairing.
“I felt like our seniors all needed to be in the lineup tonight,” coach Donato said. “I think there’s a brotherhood in the locker room that understands that. To me, we’ll take a deep breath and figure out what we think is best moving forward.”
With Saturday’s bout, the five members of the class of 2020 bid farewell to their final regular season. Now, their careers in the crimson and white will last as long as the team’s postseason hopes.
Originally a cohort of eight, the group will graduate five strong after the early NHL departures of blue-liners Adam Fox and John Marino, as well as the transfer to Wisconsin of centerman Ty Pelton-Byce due to academic eligibility complications.
Of the remaining members, four are forwards. Krusko heads the bunch, having logged 53 career points (18–35—53) and earned Beanpot MVP honors as a first-year winger on the Frozen Four-bound 2016-2017 squad. Krusko leads this year’s iteration of the Crimson in games played, now with 129.
Colton Kerfoot has skated in 80 matchups over his career, amassing 22 points (6–16—22) in the process. Fellow British Columbia native Szeto (23 career GP, 0–1—1) has seen his role increase as an upperclassman and, by all accounts, has been an exemplar of the Harvard program on and off the ice.
Another Canadian, Frédéric Grégoire (84 career GP, 10–14—24), has been an important roster piece for multiple of coach Donato’s teams. As a junior, the versatile forward found chemistry on the bottom six and was voted the most improved player by his teammates after the 2018-2019 season.
Gornet has manned the pipes for the Crimson for parts of four seasons. In 27 career appearances, the St. Louis, Mo. product is 10-5-3 on the backs of a 2.56 goals against average and a .916 save percentage.
In total, these five Harvard icemen have been a part of 75 program victories. Of course, they are hoping to add several more to that tally before they officially hang up the skates.
