After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The winner of Harvard’s 2011 Freshman Talent Show last Tuesday was Christopher Eur ’15 from Sacramento, Calif. For his act, he beatboxed—which he learned by watching YouTube videos—while he performed an improvised jazz piece on the piano. “You can do most of the sounds without your hands,” Eur said, “except for some scratching sounds.” His 14 freshmen competitors showcased a diverse range of talents, from Chinese sword dancing to a piano and saxophone duet.
Eur decided to audition for the talent show after spending time with a few Freshman Arts Program (FAP) participants during his first weeks on campus. Though he enjoys the adrenaline rush of performing, Eur said that he auditioned mostly with an eye to entertain: “It was the last evening before our classes started, and I just thought it would be nice to let everyone enjoy and have a chill night.”
Though Eur hopes to use his beatboxing abilities in one of Harvard’s a cappella groups, he is looking forward to a fresh start in a myriad of other areas. He explains that he has had a fair amount of “fresh starts” in the course of his life—moving to South Korea when he was very young and then to Sacramento when he was 13 with his mother. He counts these transitions as some of his best experiences: “They teach you the things that are important and the sort of people you hold on to,” he said. He attributes that these transitions inspired him to keep trying new things—one of which is his beatboxing-piano performance. This time around, Eur said that he hopes to learn to dance. He prefers hip-hop but may also learn Indian folk dance, known as bhangra, which his roommate enjoys.
Academically, Eur is interested in the philosophy of the mind-body problem, the “order from chaos” involved in drawing consciousness from neural networks, and the study of mathematics. He is particularly inspired by Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology Steven Pinker’s books “The Blank Slate” and “How the Mind Works,” and hopes to take a class with Pinker this spring. He would like to combine math, psychology, and his pre-med curriculum—for he said that while he appreciates the abstraction of math and philosophy, he would like to be able to do something that helps people more directly. While the potential of Eur’s beatboxing abilities remains to be seen, he is enthusiastic about joining Harvard’s dance and a cappella groups. In the meantime, he is keeping busy meeting the Class of 2015, enjoying long conversations with his roommate, and preparing for his fall semester classes—his favorites are his freshman seminar and Mathematics 55a: “Honors Abstract Algebra.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leonardo da Vinci famously mastered both art and science, blending them in some of his greatest innovations—but he was far from the only thinker of his day to do so, according to Susan M. Dackerman. Dackerman, the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Curator of Prints for the Harvard Art Museums, is the curator of this fall’s newest exhibit at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum: “Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge in Early Modern Europe.” On display until December 10, this is the first special exhibit Harvard Art Museums has launched since the Fogg Museum closed for renovations in 2008.
Renaissance-era artists across Europe created scientific prints and instruments that wedded functionality with aesthetic finesse. The new exhibit draws together maps, charts, and scientific tools created by artists like German printmakers Albrecht Dürer and Hans Holbein, emphasizing the interdisciplinary sensibilities of northern European Renaissance artists and their contributions to science.  “I think ultimately what I wanted was for students to think about the role of artists differently,” Dackerman says.
Artists’ skillful renderings helped Renaissance scientists visualize discoveries and share ideas, as evidenced in this exhibit’s anatomical diagrams, printed maps, astrological charts, and hypothetical geometric figures. But the artists were not merely hired illustrators, Dackerman noted—they were knowledgeable and even innovative collaborators in science themselves. Through pieces like Augustin Hirschvogel’s map “Moscovia” and Dürer’s human proportion studies, the exhibit reveals that these artists shared a preoccupation with understanding and advancing the scientific discoveries of their contemporaries. “You think of artists as individuals working from imagination or observation, but in the 16th  century, [the arts and sciences] were overlapping spheres of knowledge,” Dackerman says.
While designing the exhibit’s catalogue with the help of an interdisciplinary seminar at the Mahindra Humanities Center, Dackerman also sought to reunite Renaissance artists’ prints with the scientific instruments they had designed and used. Artists’ instruments are often parceled off to different museums than their prints, Dackerman explained, and art history students who have studied Erhard Etzlaub’s map, “This Is the Way To Rome” may know nothing of his compasses. This exhibit features both in order to present a more complete portrait of Etzlaub’s expertise.  “In the way that [academics] codify knowledge and segregate it, we had artificially taken things apart that had naturally been together,” Dackerman says. “What this exhibition hopes to do is bring all of that together, so that the overlapping spheres of knowledge make sense again.”
The exhibit highlights the functionality of its pieces and the technological possibilities of printing, featuring designs for fold-up paper compasses and sundials alongside their finished counterparts. It also includes side-by-side globe “gores”—printed strips of paper bearing the globe’s geographical or astrological representations—and the finished globes themselves.
Yet the exhibit does not ignore the artistry of these pieces in favor of their technological functionality. Particular attention is paid to artistic depictions of scientific phenomenon like constellations and symbolic illustrations of scientific disciplines. Take Dutch artist Jan Saenredam’s globe design: according to Chris Barrett, a graduate student in the English department who worked on the exhibit, the globe’s dynamic astrological characters and nationalistic nuances spurred a “new visual language” for drawing constellations.
In the process of opening “Prints and Pursuits of Knowledge,” Dackerman and History of Science professor Katharine Park—who co-chaired the Mahindra Center seminar that developed the exhibit—kept their monthly discussions open to the public and to students and faculty of all disciplines. They drew members from departments such as History of Art and Architecture, History of Science, and English—and Dackerman noted that the exhibit grew as these members shared research and ideas for further study.
“[Our exhibit’s development] links to the way scholars in the period we were researching also worked. Knowledge then was also a collaborative effort,” says History of Art and Architecture graduate student Jasper C. van Putten. Dackerman says most exhibits today develop as the work of a single academic. “At a university museum, it should be different. It should be a pedagogic opportunity. It should be a more open process,” Dackerman says.
Interdisciplinary collaboration has made the exhibit richer, Dackerman says. “I think it is ultimately more fruitful ... What is in the exhibition represents many different people’s interests.”
Dackerman chose some of the exhibit pieces for seminar students to research, but frequently, she said, objects that her seminar students found and suggested themselves made it into the final collection. Her students also wrote the exhibit catalogue entries for every piece. For many graduate students, research for the exhibit built upon their studies for their degrees, and several—among them van Putten—even altered their dissertations in response.
“I’m grateful to Susan for her effort and enthusiasm to bring students into the project,” van Putten says. “She offers them the opportunity to work on objects, and she trusts that students will do that well.”
Professors in History of Art and Architecture, History of Science, Music, and the sciences have expressed interest in tying the exhibit into their curricula, Dackerman says. Exhibit programming also features events open to the public and the entire Harvard community, including numerous upcoming lectures, discussion groups, and musical performances.
As the Fogg Museum’s 2013 reopening draws near, “Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge” acts as a model for exhibits that will be shown in the renovated museum, said Thomas W. Lentz, the Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums. Lentz says he hopes to see this exhibit’s collaborative development, depth of inquiry, and teaching potential in every Fogg exhibition.
“An art museum should work both ways,” Lentz says. “We should be able to help the rest of the university create different kinds of teaching and learning experiences through our exhibitions, and in return, we love being able to work with a very hardworking, bright student body and faculty.”
“I actually sent a copy of the [exhibit] catalogue to [University President] Drew [G.] Faust the other day,” Lentz said. As he described the note he included with Faust’s catalogue, his excitement was clear: “I wrote that this is the kind of level and quality we aspire to in our new building,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Divide and conquer is sort of the design scheme here,” says antiques dealer Andrew Spindler as we walk toward the concrete and brick rectangles of freshman dorm Canaday Hall. “I got solitary confinement,” says Spindler’s friend and interior designer Heidi M. Pribell ’82, a former Canaday resident.
Built in 1974, Canaday was constructed to prevent student riots: “They didn’t really want you to assemble,” says Spindler. In this sense, Canaday is an obvious example of an interior designer’s ability to influence behavior. Another aspect of freshman dorm design also caught Spindler’s expert eye: a lone teddy bear perched on a Thayer windowsill. “There’s some context where stuffed animals in the window mean you’re a drug addict,” he explains.
Surrounded by students in bright shorts ranting maniacally about “Love Story,” I wandered around campus chatting with Spindler and Pribell about the relationship between building design, history, and function. The autumnal ritual of nervous, curious, and bemused freshmen moving into the 17 redbrick first-year dorms has been repeated once more, debt ceilings and Arab revolutions be damned. This is where they will sleep, eat Annenburgled food, study, relax, and drink soda during the year to come. While they may have agonized over which Urban Outfitters notepad would best suit their desk, hardly any freshmen think of how the design of these dorms will affect their behavior. And though design is usually understood in terms of aesthetics, it can also be discussed in terms of social effect. Enter Spindler and Pribell, experts recruited to tour the freshman dorms and analyze this potential influence.
DESIGNING DECORUM
Design Critic and Graduate School of Design Lecturer Gabriel N. Duarte leads me through the Graduate School of Design’s Gund Hall, an angular, symmetric interior of concrete, glass, and metal. We pull together two chairs in a meeting room, thereby creating a private office. For Duarte, design encourages rather than limits certain modes of behavior. “So many people think that architecture is supposed to prevent you from doing stuff. A window is so that you don’t jump out of your bedroom. A door is to be shut,” he says. Design, then, provides a range of suggestions for how people can act in a given space. Though it may not condition behavior, it does provide behavior’s vocabulary.
When design attempts to be inoffensive, it provides an unduly limited vocabulary. “It’s a commonplace thing nowadays that if you have these super bland and flexible spaces people actually don’t use them to their full extent because they’re not stimulated to think about what that space can be,” Duarte explains. In a dormitory, where the design seeks to be universally tolerable, ‘bland and flexible’ are aspirations more than criticisms. Great design, however, does not necessarily ensure creative and productive behavior. “People can be stimulated to do [something], but not be told to,” says Duarte. “There’s a difference.”
Duarte’s point is that design goes beyond aesthetic: a room is no more four walls than a smartphone is a jumble of plastic and metal. “When you design something like [a smartphone], you’re not just designing the object, but you’re designing the set of relationships that the object allows you to have with other things,” he says. In this way, a designer does not simply create a room design but actually influences the inhabitant’s relationships with the things and people in that room. While bad design leaves a space anonymous and inactive, good design opens up possibilities for interaction and activity. Duarte points to our ‘office’ for emphasis. “Like this chair. A chair is a chair, but once they’re placed like this they just become like a living room.”
CANASTROPHE
“The chair definitely anticipates that you’re going to be rocking back and be a nervous wreck. They probably have had experience where the chairs kept breaking,” says Spindler as we examine the standard-issue Harvard desk chair. We’re inside Canaday, now, and after being greeted by what Spindler deems a “claustrophobic” hallway, exploring the bathrooms, and passing some unsuspecting entryway-mates, the designers are poking around the common room of Lucy A. Walsh ’15.
The two make their way to the suite wall, where a fire extinguisher sits. “Like the size of this,” says Spindler, pointing to multiple warning signs, “this doesn’t need to be that big … this is like when you get a Skymall Magazine and all of the products are all in anticipation of some kind of apocalyptic event.” “It just should say ‘hazard, hazard, hazard!’” chimes in Pribell, flashing her hands with each repetition. “This is like when you go to a restaurant and order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and they have a sign saying that there may be peanuts in it.”
While both designers were generally critical of Canaday’s isolating layout, they agreed that its location—situated close to classes and with striking views of both Memorial Hall and Memorial Church—was, in Spindler’s words, “primo real estate.” “I think that when you come to Harvard as a freshman, you really want to look at ivy-covered walls,” he suggests. “[Canaday] really fulfills the fantasy of ivy-covered walls.” When I ask Spindler what kinds of freshmen he would put in Canaday, he replies, “People that need to be disciplined and sequestered. Or ascetic types who thrive on serene views of campus with a minimal amount of interaction.”
We continue into Walsh’s bedroom, a medium-sized single with standard Harvard furniture: a desk, bookshelf, bed, and drawers. “The big expression of any individual is the bedding,” says Pribell. “I mean, I got in trouble my freshman week because my mother told me I couldn’t get my own bedding, that I’d have to use Harvard bedding. I cried so hard.”
PIPE-WORTHY
“This is definitely [in the style of a] gentleman’s club,” says Spindler as we enter Matthews Hall, built in 1871. He points out the surrounding dark greens, elegant wainscoting, and gothic-inspired ironwork. “People should be smoking pipes in here,” Pribell adds with an awed voice. We climb the open staircase and the designers rush through quickly, stepping out of their way to get a closer view and to touch the walls and wood.
We invite ourselves into another room, and Spindler and Pribell are immediately taken with the surroundings. I ask them if this space—a larger, well lit common room, wood floors and paneling, and a large window seat—encourages anything that Canaday prohibits. “Assembly,” says Pribell, almost immediately. “I think that it is definitely more communal,” embellishes Spindler. “I think it’s snuggly!” interrupts  Pribell.
We finish looking around and leave Matthews for a last stroll. As we walk away, Spindler and Pribell agree that the dorm is elegant, almost to the point of excess. “This was a bit of a vanity project for Mr. Matthews, don’t you think?” he asks. “Yeah,” she replies, “everyone’s searching for immortality.”
We exit Matthews and talk furniture on the way to Apley Court. “A desk can tell you so much about the social history and cultural history in the time in which it was made. Issues of privacy, correspondence, power, I think all those things you can find,” says Spindler, as he discusses his profession as an antiques dealer. He points to the history in our quotidian possessions, their ability to tell a story, how they were used, how they were intended.
Apley, the 1897 brownstone apartment complex just south of the Yard, was originally intended for the wealthy, male students of a bygone era. The room we visited, however, was inhabited by two female students, proudly on financial aid. Spindler calls attention to these students as evincing democratic change: these spaces were designed for an utterly different type of individual who would bear no resemblance to today’s residents. “I think today, the stereotype of who would live here, you know, the Winklevoss twins, I think they’re in a way archaic as far as the typical profile of Harvard students.” In Apley, the contrast between design intent and building use shows that a building’s designer may not be able to control actual behavior even while her goals remain clear.
SHAPE THE SPACE
In each dorm that we visited, Spindler and Pribell identified subtle aspects that create a consistent, even overwhelming aesthetic. In Canaday, the design dynamic of power and control the dorm manifests itself today in modern isolation; in Matthews, the elegance becomes an encouragement for enthusiasm and socializing; and in Apley, the grandeur becomes a reminder of the patriarchy and elitism of the past. “[College students] should be aware…[that] they have to occupy [a space] to make it useful. There’s a saying in architecture that space only exists once it’s actually performed. Otherwise it’s just a place.” No matter the strength of suggestion, in the end it is the students who decide which hints to pick up on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 800 University workers and students marched on Cambridge Common Monday to show support for unionized dining hall workers, custodians, and janitors during their contract negotiations with Harvard, which are ongoing.
Giant puppets bumped into onlooking Harvard students as the procession, organized by Service Employees International Union, passed through Harvard Yard.
The march was attended by workers from three Harvard unions—the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, UNITE HERE!, and SEIU—representing workers from across the University. More than 30 students joined the Labor Day demonstration.Marchers carried signs with slogans like “More Time With Our Families” and “Harvard—Keeping us all from a new prosperity,” and chanted together lines like “Si se puede! (Yes we can!)” and “Harvard, escucha—estamos en la lucha (Harvard, listen—we are in the fight!).
Will P. Whitham ’14, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement and one of the leaders of the student contingent present at the event, said that the march was intended to show support for the workers during their negotiations.
“This fall is really just a critical time for workers,” Whitham said. “It’s a really critical time for students and workers to come together to advocate for better working positions and really sustainable jobs.”
The demand for sustainable jobs—including 40 hour workweeks and yearlong jobs, according to SLAM members—was one of the major focuses for leaders at the rally.
“There needs to be an end of workers cobbling together part-time jobs,” said Nancy B. Kohn, a publicist for SEIU. “We are fighting for a better life, for jobs with dignity.”
UNITE HERE! Local 26 President Brian Lang seconded Kohn’s call for sustainable jobs. “Most Harvard dining hall workers get laid off during the summer for three months, and they can’t collect unemployment,” he said. “That is an issue that needs to be addressed.”
Lang also said that one of the primary purposes of the demonstration was to show solidarity between SEIU and UNITE HERE! in the face of their contract negotiations. “This rally is so that Harvard sees it’s not just security guards, it’s not just janitors. It’s security guards, and janitors, and dining hall workers together,” he said. “We’ve pledged that we’re in this until there’s justice for every one of us.”
The rally hosted a number of speakers, including Lieutenant Governor Timothy P. Murray, who emphasized the importance of workers having the opportunity to improve their lives.
“People who work hard every single day deserve a fair wage,” he said.
SEIU employee Nancy Diaz, who attended the rally, said that she came to demand sustainable jobs for her and her colleagues. “I don’t get to share a lot of time with my kids,” she said. “And a lot of my friends have to work to jobs. We need to support each other so we can win a better contract.”

UPDATE: 3:47 a.m. on Sept. 6, 2011
The 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks this Sunday will see a number of commemorative events across the University, including a College-wide vigil, according to an email sent to all undergraduates from the Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds last week.
“You are all part of a generation that has come of age in the wake of 9/11,” wrote Hammonds in the email. “[The vigil] will be an opportunity for you to join with fellow students to reflect on the attacks, their legacy, and their meaning.”
The evening event will feature Hammonds and Lowell House Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck, as well as Elizabeth R. Moroney ’12-’13,  whose father worked in the World Trade Center and passed away, and a member of the Harvard Islamic Society, according to College spokesperson Jeff Neal.
Moroney, who will share her personal reflections on the event, said she felt the vigil will be an opportunity to give students insight on how a tragedy can affect a family.
The event was planned by the Office of Student Life, with input from many students, including student leaders at the Interfaith Council, Neal said.
In addition to the College-sponsored vigil, Hammonds highlighted a variety of other 9/11-related events that will occur leading up to and throughout the day.
The Memorial Church and Lowell House bells will toll on Sunday at 8:46, 9:03, 9:37, and 10:06 a.m.—the exact times that planes crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Shanksville, Penn on the morning of 9/11.
The Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers at Harvard College, who traditionally ring the House bells on Sunday afternoons, will ring the 13-ton blagovest bell named Mother Earth ten times at each of the designated times on Sunday morning, according to Inna Ryzhik ’12 and Ivan D. Bochkov ’12, co-presidents of the Bell Ringers.
Since the Lowell House bells cannot be heard at Memorial Church, and vice versa, the ringing of the bells at both locations will allow the commemoration to be a campus-wide event, Bochkov said.
In addition, the Bell Ringers will be using their traditional 1 p.m. concert time to further commemorate the national tragedy. This Sunday, unlike most Sundays, the Bell Ringers will do only the traditional ringing of the Russian peals, reflecting the solemnity of the occasion, Ryzhik said.
And at 11 a.m., Kennedy School of Government Public Service Professor David R. Gergen will lead a Sunday service at Memorial Church that he said will focus on reflecting “back to the day’s memory.”
Gergen said he has been studying sermons by the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes in the aftermath of 9/11, in an attempt to pass along the wisdom of Gomes, who Gergen said served as a “social guide to a great many people on campus during that period.” The title of Gergen’s sermon bears the same name as Gomes’ first sermon after 9/11: “Outer Turmoil, Inner Strength.”
He added that the sermon focuses not only on the day of 9/11, but also about the 10 years that have passed since the tragedy.
“It’s a time to reflect on ... what the Scriptures tell us about how to relate to the events of that day and what’s come since,” Gergen said.
Other events that day include a University-sponsored commemorative performance at Sanders Theatre and an interfaith discussion hosted by the Harvard Chaplains.

Kirkland House temporarily turned into a fortress with the help of Laura E. D'Asaro '13 and other House residents. You may remember D'Asaro from two years ago, when D’Asaro broke the world record for crawling the fastest mile in 22 minutes and four seconds. Seeing box after box piling up in recycling bins during move-in as a sophomore, D'Asaro was inspired to build a giant box fort. Only 284 boxes were needed to break the record, but the final fortress consisted of exactly double that amount.

Some people smugly tell you, the day before classes even start, that they know exactly what they're taking. Others, on the eve of study card day, admit that they don't have a clue—either hanging harried heads in shame, or speaking with great pride in their indecision (like this blogger, who once happily printed six different versions of her study card for her adviser to sign).
Some students scribble notes throughout the first lecture; some don't even bring a book bag. Some are sitting in their seats on the first day perfectly on time and would never dream of cutting out early, while others crowd in long after all the chairs are taken, or awkwardly climb over dozens of fellow shoppers to leave before the lecture ends.
Shopping week, derided by some as stressful and hailed by many more as an exhilarating opportunity to sample the mind-boggling variety of courses offered at Harvard, can be a very personal matter. One of those choices that all shoppers must make is their shopping tool.
Just as shopping week offers you far more courses than you can take, the menu of shopping tools available to you is broad, and you have to pick. Don't get caught with part of your shopping list in one place and part in another, then realize at the last minute that you have a schedule conflict you didn't notice because one course was on your my.harvard list and the other was stored by CS50.
 Your options are as follows:
For starters, there's the my.harvard.edu "Courses" tab, which lets you search for courses by name, read their descriptions, and store a list of the ones you're interested in. There's a pretty nifty tool for comparing your possible courses' Q scores, and a nice graphic schedule tab that shows you in full color that you've scheduled yourself for nine different classes at 1 p.m. on Mondays (true story of this blogger's initial shopping list this semester). You'll have to use this one eventually to create your final study card, but it's a pretty clunky interface—adding or deleting a course to your list can take a lot of scrolling up and down, for instance—so it's perhaps not your best bet for your master planner.
As is true of shuttle services, maps, and the events calendar, CS50 takes something that the University already offers and does it better. Its course tool not only offers basic search, but also lets you see which of your Facebook friends are shopping or taking courses. You can tell it to avoid courses that fall in your "busy blocks"—which we all know means all day Friday or any day before 10 a.m. And it even shows you the required books for a course, with links for purchasing them at the Coop or on Amazon or viewing them in Google Books. Just be sure to click over to your Facebook page to delete the obnoxious announcement that it puts on your Wall when you first start using the tool, even if you tell it you want to be "invisible." We think that adding CS50 to every user's shopping list automatically is cute marketing, but it's irritating to see that red HarvardCourses box in your news feeds over and over.
Since the course catalog went online-only in 2009, many students don't think to page through the entire catalog as they did when it was a book. To this blogger, though, that's the only way to shop. If you so choose, take the time to open every department's page on the Registrar's website and skim the list of classes, making your own shopping list of the most interesting ones in a Word document or in any other tool you choose. Yes, it takes time, but it's the only way to find those intriguing courses which aren't offered by your concentration and aren't wildly overpopulated. You'll come out of the exercise depressed by the paltry number of classes you can actually take and more appreciative than ever of the phenomenal wealth of opportunities available at the College.
