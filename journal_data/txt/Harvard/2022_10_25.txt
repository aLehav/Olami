Referencing my family's roots, this still life depicts aspects of the typical Argentinian meals I grew up savoring. It features empanadas, a prepared mate (caffeinated, South American tea), its thermo (flask), a medium-rare steak from an asado (barbecue) topped with chimichurri sauce, a potted ceibo plant (Argentina's national flower), and alfajores (dulce de leche cookies) served on a wooden dining room table.
Asados and mate are essential elements of Argentine culture. They represent friendship, camaraderie, and life. Participating in “una ronda de mate” is a ceremonial social act. Typically only done with friends or people you want to become close to, guests sit in a circle and pass the gourd around after the cebador serves the drink. These traditions serve as celebrations of and opportunities for conversation, connection, and community.
A variety of stroke lengths, hues, and stippling techniques were used to suggest the illusion of disarray and texture. The colorful patterns on the empanada were created by repeatedly making small dots (frequently around the edges and sparingly towards the center highlights) with enough pressure to leave behind some waxy residue to mimic texture. The lighter lines around the bottom edge of the empanada are the result of digging a wooden, pointed ceramic tool into the oil pastel and scraping the waxy medium off to reveal the tinted mylar (A paper-like plastic sheet) underneath.

On Oct. 14, two fossil fuel protesters threw two cans of tomato soup on Vincent van Gogh’s painting “Sunflowers” and glued themselves to the wall of the crime scene. For everyone concerned: The painting was not damaged and is back on display at the National Gallery in London as of Oct. 15. Meanwhile, the two activists pleaded not guilty to criminal damage at the Westminster Magistrates’ Court later that day.
Despite debate over their method of protest, the protesters succeeded in garnering media attention. Social media sites were flooded with pictures of the two activists glued to the London National Gallery wall, holding up two cans of Heinz tomato soup. Safe to say, the two protesters made Heinz’s PR manager very happy. After all, there is nothing better than free media attention!
It seems free media attention is exactly what the two “Just Stop Oil” climate activists were going for. “We’re doing these actions to get media attention because we need to get people talking about this now,” one of the activists said in reference to the growing movement. To what extent throwing soup at an almost 200-year-old sunflower painting will truly generate media attention capable of saving the environment is debatable. Yet, this event is only the latest of many art-based nonviolent acts of protest that have occurred throughout Europe in recent months.
Earlier this year, activists glued themselves to Horatio McCulloch’s “My Heart’s in the Highlands” in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. Shortly thereafter, a new generation of climate activists was born — a generation that stuck themselves to world famous paintings in world famous art galleries as means of protest. But why do protesters turn to canonical art to make statements? After all, the act of drenching a van Gogh in tomato soup does not exactly have an obvious link to the current climate crisis.
Yet, it is undeniable that the iconic paintings represent historical status and wealth. “What is worth more — art or life?” the activist asked, her hand still glued to the wall. “Is it worth more than food? Worth more than justice? Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting, or the protection of our planet and people? The cost of living crisis is part of the cost of the oil crisis. Fuel is unaffordable to millions of cold, hungry families. They can’t even afford to heat a tin of soup.” While these are certainly poignant questions, one cannot help but ask if that is what the public will retain from this performance.
Granted: Impactful activism is difficult. Clearly, in today‘s society, dramatic action is a very effective way to command attention. Climate change is one of the most, if not the most pressing issues of this generation. Imminent global action is necessary, but what is true protest and what is performance art? Is throwing soup at paintings the solution to the climate crisis?
Probably not.

Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi’s animated Netflix special “Entergalatic” chronicles the life of cartoonist Jabari (Mescudi) as he navigates love, drugs, and making a living as an artist. The special is presented as a series with five chapters with a total runtime of 92 minutes. The show’s soundtrack is performed by Mescudi, which he recently announced will be his last Kid Cudi album.
In the words of the iconic Cher Horowitz of 1995’s “Clueless,” “Entergalatic” is “a full-on Monet… It's like a painting, see. From far away, it's okay, but up close, it's a big ol' mess.”
While Mescudi creates a visually appealing and modern adult animation, its simplistic plot makes the show feel like a monotonous combination of montages backed by his original music. Ultimately, “Entergalatic” is best enjoyed as a beautiful series of moments, as its writing lacks substance.
The viewers meet Jabari at an important moment in his life. After starting his new job and meeting Meadow (Jessica Williams), Jabari spends most of the series smoking weed and debating whether or not he should date her: This lack of stakes makes the series feel aimless, as none of the characters have real arcs. From the very introduction of Meadow, it is clear that they will end up together by the end of the special.
The special is nonetheless important for its portrayal of Black love, critique of the corporatization of art, and its costume design, which draws from the work of the late Virgil Abloh. Mescudi has cited the legendary Louis Vuitton artistic director as an inspiration and consultant for the project.
This attention to detail is notable, as each character feels realized in their personal style: Jabari’s crew necks, cargo pants, and muted tones compliment his stubbornness and insecurities about starting a new job. Conversely, his two love interests Meadow (Jessica Williams) and Carmen (Laura Harrier) exist on opposite sides of the fashion spectrum — a choice that reflects their different roles in Jabari’s life. Whereas Meadow — a photographer who is Jabari’s next-door neighbor and key love interest — rocks a leather jacket and cool tones accompanied by chunky silver jewelry and locs, Jabari’s clingy ex Carmen sports a baby pink lip, an all-white loungewear set, and no jewelry.
These details help make up for what the writing lacks. As the plot slowly sputters out into the classic “will they/won’t they” arc of a romantic comedy, the costume design and set design help viewers make important inferences about the motivations of the characters. These detailed visual elements end up being the backbone of the special. For example, when supporting characters tell stories, the animation style changes to complement their style, ranging from comic book style to crayon to anime.
“Entergalactic”’s animation style is similar to that of the 2018 Academy Award-winning feature “Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse,” which uses vibrant colors that make the art feel alive. This style works particularly well for animating New York City, where both stories are set.“Entergalatic” garnered interest because of these similarities, but sadly lacks the merit plot-wise.
The unsatistyling plot is the most frustrating element of the special. Although “Entergalatic” is full of talented actors and celebrities like Timothée Chalamet, Jaden Smith and Vanessa Hudgens, the end result is not on par with the rest of their work. The names attached to this project are a huge draw for audiences, yet feel insignificant due to the unexciting story.
“Entergalactic” is the kind of Netflix movie you might put on at a kickback with a group of friends and strangers. It will make you appear tasteful and has musical breaks that allow for conversation between serious moments, but the plot is unsubstantial enough to fade into the background of a social setting. It is designed with Netflix’s signature no-rewinding, no-pausing binge watching experience in mind.
The show appeals to both the History & Literature concentrator or the hype beast next door, and Kid Cudi celebrates art, hip hop culture, skateboarding, and romance with eye-catching animation that help viewers tolerate the often disinteresting dialogue.

The CW’s latest addition "The Winchesters" is an ultimate bust, with poor writing and a cliché plot. The pilot fails in establishing an engaging prequel to the original cult-acclaimed series and falls flat in its delivery.
The CW’s longest running show "Supernatural" premiered in September of 2005. 15 seasons and 327 episodes later, "Supernatural" has cultivated and retained a devoted fanbase, changing the lives of fans around the country. Some devotees have gotten quotes and symbols of the show permanently tattooed on their bodies, while others have found community among fellow “Supernatural” fans, tuning in to every season for the comfort the characters provide.
A prequel to “Supernatural,” "The Winchesters" tells the epic, “untold” love story of John Winchester (Drake Rodger) and Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly) as they hunt ghosts, demons, and other supernatural beings. What’s mildly confusing about this new show is that the original series has opened and already closed the story of Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padelecki) Winchester’s parents. "The Winchesters" seems to believe that "Supernatural" left John and Mary’s origin up for interpretation and aims to remedy a problem that does not exist. Furthermore, the prequel completely rewrites this established storyline. In "Supernatural," John knew absolutely nothing about demons, is saved by Mary, and falls in love; in "The Winchesters," both their fathers have gone missing due to "Supernatural" forces and they are forced to save the world together.
When the spin-off show was announced, fans and former cast members alike were caught off-guard. After the news broke in June 2022, actor Jared Padelecki tweeted, “Wish I heard about this some way other than Twitter. I’m excited to watch, but bummed that Sam Winchester had no involvement whatsoever.” From then on, it was pretty clear that this new CW show was off to a rocky start, but it would not stop some fans from wanting to tune in and re-experience the magic from the original series.
"The Winchesters" copies and pastes the "Supernatural" formula, but unfortunately falls short in making the show stand out. In the premiere of “Supernatural,” brothers Sam and Dean were reunited because, as Dean says: “Dad’s on a hunting trip, and he hasn’t been home in a few days.” In “The Winchesters,” John and Mary are united because both their fathers have gone missing while hunting demons, leaving a slew of perfectly laid out clues for them to uncover and have romantic tension over. Mary reuses Dean’s line, saying, “Dad called me from the road. Said he was being followed by demons and that he’d meet me at home, but he never showed.” As this recycled line of dialogue suggests, the show’s plot is unoriginal, unextraordinary, and ultimately boring: Viewers have already seen this story play out on screen hundreds of times before. Yes, daddy issues are interesting and, yes, they seem to be a staple in CW shows; however, the "Supernatural" writers have already made 15 seasons on this same plot. Furthermore, this prequel completely disregards the previously established origin of John and Mary, retconning it for one unrecognizable to original fans.
Even if you’re not a fan of the previous series and you just want to tune in for a fun, late-night watch, the show is difficult to follow. If "The Winchesters" is rewriting “Supernatural,” perhaps wanting to reach more fans is the reason. If that were true, there would be the usual CW flair, with jokes and genuine fun thrown into the pilot to make viewers pay attention. While other CW shows such as “Riverdale” and “The Flash” have a “so bad, it’s good” appeal, "The Winchesters" is a jumbled mess that forgets how to entertain its audience. Even when “Supernatural” lulled, the show still remembered how to amuse viewers by way of fun, fast-paced monster hunting and outlandish, recurring gags. Although "The Winchesters" seems to be reusing plot points from the original series, it does not borrow this beloved convention — save for two exorcisms set to classic rock music and poor fights shot in hilariously slow motion.
One of few scenes from this show that has any emotional resonance or major "Supernatural" magic to it was at the end when the camera cuts to Dean (Jensen Ackles) with his back against his infamous Impala, notebook in hand as he writes about his parents. Here, it is clear that Dean is on a journey to uncover how Mary and John got together. Although the story is changed and Ackles has aged, this scene felt intensely real, almost cinematic. Ackles’s return as Dean makes the pilot close to worthwhile. As he drives his memorable 1967 Chevy Impala off into gray skies and everlasting fields, he says, “Now, I know this story might sound familiar, but I’m going to put the pieces together in a way that just might surprise you.”
Perhaps this final scene is hinting that the writers of "The Winchesters" are leaving their roots behind and starting something new. The real question is: Are they headed in a good direction?
So far, this doesn’t seem to be the case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sierra was staring at the ceiling, hands folded across her chest, thinking about tomorrow. It was her first night at Uni, and she was so excited she couldn’t sleep. Though she was a regular insomniac, her melatonin usually had her out by 2:00 A.M.. It was 3:17.
I watched her as she tossed and turned. I thought it was funny how she rolled to her side, on her stomach, and to her back again like rotisserie. No amount of concealer would save her from greeting new peers with half-moons under her eyes. Dammit, Sierra thought, pushing her head under the covers.
I was excited too. I wanted to see the campus and the people and the professors and, of course, the food. I wanted to see what the classrooms looked like and hear my voice echo off the theater-like walls. But tomorrow would just be orientation, so it’d be about tight smiles and menial chatter. I had seen the way Sierra did it before, when she went to her robotics trips and competitions or to sleep-away camp or whatever. It was always tight-lipped.
“Hi, I’m Sierra. What’s your name?”
“Nice to meet you.”
“Where are you from?”
“Where do you go to school?” Or now, I guessed it’d be “What do you study?”
“Wow, really!”
“Ugh, I’m so tired. I was up till three.”
“Same.”
It’s not that I had a problem with meeting new people; I just hated the script. I hated that Sierra always shook so many hands, but never knew anybody. Not really. She was always so wound up, so folded, so… so… onion. And everyone else was the same, I guessed. They all had layers and versions of themselves they kept so wound up that, at the end of the day, there were just a whole lotta vegetables in the room.
Sierra hadn’t always been that way, of course. But around the time she got into high school, it felt like there were multiple Sierras running around. There were two Sierras at home — the one around mum and pop, who was respectful but distant, and the one who was with our little brother Syros. Syros’s version of Sierra was always snappy and on edge, ready to bite his annoying little head off. Then, there was the Sierra in classes, who was like mum’s version but with a little more bite. She was never disrespectful with teachers, but she was wary of their authoritarian flippancy and her grades often suffered for it. And, there was a whole flock of Sierras around her friends — the dark humor Sierra, the preppy Sierra, the nonchalant Sierra. They switched in and out like apparitions, animating the things she said and her hand gestures and her facial expressions. It seemed natural to the brief onlooker, but was a horror to view in its totality. I watched her reassemble every day.
There was a secret Sierra when she — we — were alone. She was flat and calm; unattended and expressionless. But she never lasted long, because soon enough she would FaceTime someone or another, or do her homework, or watch a show, or read something. She would check out. She never just sat alone. Never just sat with me.
I wondered which version would climb out of bed tomorrow, or I guess in the next three hours. How would she walk? How would she laugh? What words would she use and for who? Either way, she’d be new. Newness always made my stomach turn. I missed Sierra’s Sierra. Mine. Before she was all mixed up with parts of everyone else. But if I thought about that for too long, I’d get a lump in my throat.
She was finally sleeping soundly, and I was the one overly excited now, mentally prepping for her to shapeshift and multiply in her sleep. Sierra wasn’t the only one who’d meet a new cast of peers in the morning.

Each year, there are only a handful of new films released that hold the undeniable power to transfix audiences and enhance common understandings of how stories can be told on screen. “Tár” is one such film. This spectacular project, written and directed by Todd Field, stars Cate Blanchett as the fictional conductor Lydia Tár, who is renowned as one of the greatest musical minds of the twenty-first century. Over the course of the lengthy but beautifully constructed film, viewers witness the slow unraveling of Tár’s meticulously crafted work and psyche by her own famed hands. Thanks to its captivating lead performance, beautiful sound design and cinematography, and unique self-assuredness, “Tár” sets itself apart as a nearly perfect film.
“Tár”’s most obvious and unsurprising strength is Blanchett’s interpretation of the titular character. From the very first scene, Blanchett grabs audiences’ complete attention, speaking in a posh accent, maintaining perfect posture, and exuding the passionate aura of a musical genius. It is in this last effort that Blanchett succeeds to an almost unbelievable degree, as she manages to embody an air of genius throughout the film in a way that feels honest and compelling. Eschewing any sense of the cliché, Blanchett conveys Tár’s brilliance with the utmost subtlety, allowing viewers to catch glimpses of it when she watches younger musicians audition, closes her eyes while playing the piano, and speaks of other composers with religious reverence. Truly, the ease with which Blanchett speaks of music and performers makes the film feel, at times, like a documentary about an actual musical prodigy.
Perhaps more impressive than her ability to capture Tár’s initial composure is Blanchett’s portrayal of the character’s emotional decline. As unsettling truths begin to come to light, Tár’s life of glamour turns instead to one of frenetic paranoia. Like a slowly boiling pot of water, Blanchett gradually reveals the fissures in her character’s cool demeanor in a way that seems true to life and allows for the intensity of the film’s final act to feel all the more delightfully shocking. One particular scene involving an accordion, ugly shouting, and a dead neighbor is simultaneously and unforgettably hilarious, upsetting, and absurd.
Assisting Blanchett in her tour de force is the film’s sonic and visual excellence. As to be expected of a film about a famed classical music composer, “Tár” abounds with booming, arresting moments of orchestral mastery that elevate the film’s mysterious atmosphere in remarkable ways. But perhaps more impressive than these loud and grabbing moments are the myriad of quiet, quotidian sounds like the electrical humming of a refrigerator, ticking of a metronome, or dinging of a doorbell that figure heavily in the film. These sounds fascinatingly trigger Tár’s fear and paranoia more than anything else — an inspired storytelling choice.
Though the film opts visually for rather simple shots and angles, it is the content of the scenes that is most notable. Blanchett moves through lavish European settings, rooms with opulence that is so tangible as to initiate viewers into the high-class world of classical music. While such settings are simply delightful to behold, they also serve the narrative purpose of familiarizing viewers with the high heights of fame and wealth upon which Tár is precariously perched.
Beyond all of its performative and technical achievements, however, “Tár”’s greatest strength lies in its self-assured refusal to explain itself. From very early on in the film, this quality becomes evident as Tár and her colleagues discuss the world of classical music in great and opaque detail, throwing around names and lingo unfamiliar to most audiences. While this trend is initially frustrating, it quickly becomes captivating as the film marches on without ever patronizing viewers and allowing them to feel as though they are immersed in the drama in real-time, free of any editorializing. As such, moments near the film’s ending that use clever editing to pull the rug out from underneath audiences feel truly disorienting and earned, with the final scene a surprisingly humorous stroke of genius.
There is no doubt that ‘Tár” will only grow more popular as a topic of conversation as awards season draws closer, but audiences should not delay in experiencing this film. It is far different from the stuffy, inaccessible caricature of a “serious” film that some imagine when thinking of Oscar-worthy movies. Instead, “Tár” is — at its core — a timely tale of abusing power that manages its ends in the most rewarding ways possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The saddest thing in life is wasted talent,” but no one could accuse actor and playwright Chazz Palminteri of having squandered an ounce of it. The accomplished multihyphenate brought a revival of his one-man show, “A Bronx Tale,” to the sold-out Emerson Colonial Theater on Oct. 9. The filled seats were an excellent reminder of why “A Bronx Tale” launched Palminteri to superstardom more than thirty years ago.
Since its smash hit stage debut in 1989, “A Bronx Tale” has been adapted into both a feature film and a Broadway musical, but for the revival tour, Palminteri wanted to return to the original staging of the story: Just himself and a single chair. The bare-bones staging of the play, which, following the Boston performance, Palminteri said was a financial necessity at the time of “A Bronx Tale”’s conception, is now the perfect blank canvas for Palminteri’s world of Belmont Avenue to play out upon.
Over the course of the play, which is largely an autobiographical account of Palminteri’s own childhood growing up on the streets of the Bronx circa 1960, Palminteri portrays eighteen different characters: Calogero, a stand-in for young Palminteri himself; his father Lorenzo, a hard-working bus driver; and all of the neighborhood personalities who peopled his young life. Palminteri beautifully captures how an entire world can exist within a block, with its local drugstore, favorite sports team, and — more alarmingly — its resident Mafia boss.
Calogero comes into premature contact with this more sinister side of Bronx life when at the age of nine he witnesses a gangland shooting perpetrated by Sonny, the mob boss of his neighborhood. What follows is a tug-of-war between his working-class father, who tries to keep Calogero on the straight and narrow path of hard work and integrity, and Sonny, who takes the boy under his wing and dazzles him with the intoxicating power and wealth of the criminal world.
“A Bronx Tale”’s story of a working-class, immigrant family is timeless, especially in its portrayal of the factors that push poverty-stricken communities towards crime. As Sonny tells a young Calogero early on in the play, “nobody cares.” Calogero’s world seems to support that statement: The ethnic slurs directed at himself and his loved ones and the continued poverty of his family despite Lorenzo’s constant labor are seemingly insurmountable obstacles that the self-reliant, bootstraps narrative Lorenzo subscribes to doesn’t seem adequate to address. Sonny’s criminal lifestyle presents a far more tangible route to empowerment. Of course, there’s a dark side to this power as well, which comes fully to light once Calogero falls in love with Jane, his African-American classmate, and exposes latent tensions between the Italian and Black communities.
The story of “A Bronx Tale” is so complex and the world so engrossing that it’s easy to forget the story is acted out by just one man. Palminteri is an equally adept actor and storyteller, convincingly recreating everything from the comedic neighborhood interactions he witnessed from his front stoop to the heated arguments and gang-related killings that permeated his life as he grew older. He intertwines these scenes with snippets of 1960s swing music and important developments in the career of Mickey Mantle, which act as somewhat jarring reminders of the protagonist’s youth, despite his proximity to life’s harshest elements.
Though many decades now separate Palminteri from his own days on the front stoop of a Belmont Avenue apartment, he remains close to his roots — a random heckler at the show faced his biting comebacks, and he was not afraid to defend the New York Yankees to a somewhat hostile Boston crowd. Palminteri ended the production with an encouraging message to all underdogs, delivering a touching speech relating the story of his own winding path to Hollywood success, and finishing with a restatement of his father’s advice: “The saddest thing in life is wasted talent.”
Despite the seductive power of the Mafia, the lessons of Palminteri’s honest, self-sacrificing father ultimately triumphed both on the stage and in life, and “A Bronx Tale” is a glittering tribute to people like Lorenzo who tirelessly strive for a better life for themselves and the ones they love.

Though based on a Stephen King novel, “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone” shies away from the reputed author’s traditional horror and instead errs on the side of a charming coming-of-age short story. The film is inspired by King’s book “If It Bleeds,” a collection of four previously unpublished novellas. While the film is seemingly simple in its small cast of characters, it offers trenchant social critiques of the gamut of topics it grapples with, including phone addiction and revenge.
The film follows Craig (Jaeden Martell) as he builds a relationship with business billionaire Mr. Harrigan (Donald Sutherland) and eventually remains in contact with Mr. Harrigan even beyond death through an iPhone. Craig is first employed by Mr. Harrington at a young age and reads to him weekly for over 10 years. In turn, the relationship between Craig and Mr. Harrington develops into a close friendship, as both find each other as a comforting, consistent part of their lives to discuss values and novels. Once the first iPhone comes out, Craig buys one for Mr. Harrington as a gift to connect him to technology. Martell, a familiar face in films based on Stephen King novels, is the main focus of the movie, as he grapples with growing up in a world without his late mother, and transitioning into high school life.
With all the different emotions and scenes Craig must be a part of, Martell carries the film in both his delivery and execution of emotion. Most stirring in scenes of torment and sadness, Martell’s performance is captivating — turning an unremarkable movie into an engaging one. The film, with its intense focus on death and grieving a loved one, requires a dynamic array of presences on screen. Martell takes advantage of this, and his performance captivates viewers through each intense scene Craig is involved in. This is seen most clearly when Craig’s revenge causes a cascade of strong feelings of regret and a need to atone for his actions. Through his strained facial expressions and convincing pained countenance, Martell’s acting is vital in enriching the film.
Where the film starts to lose momentum is in the events after Hr. Harrington passes away. Craig, who has been repeatedly bullied, asks the “ghost” of Mr. Harrington, to help him gain revenge on his oppressor. What results is a series of events reminiscent of the famous manga “Death Note,” where Craig asks Mr. Harrington for “help” to take care of people that have done something wrong, essentially wishing for the deaths of these individuals. While this could be seen as an indication of an area of reflection and learning from Craig, there is no actual conclusion to this theme. The film, in turn, leaves watchers feeling unresolved and unsatisfied at the end. Thus, the film disappoints in effectively executing its seemingly biggest takeaway: capitalize for revenge is destructive if left unchecked.
Moreover, the film similarly fails at conveying an effective message about modern cell phones — seemingly the basis of the movie. In an attempt to display the dangers of phone addiction, “Mr. Harrington’s Phone displays dialogue and commentary that are a little too on-the-nose. For instance, once Mr. Harrington receives his first cell phone, he immediately becomes addicted to the device and just happens to predict the eventual monopoly of phones on everyday life, including advertisements and social media. Despite Mr. Harrington not being able to actually know the future, the film inserts this to make an ineffective point on the dangers of cell phones. What is left is a motif about the consuming power of technology diluted in overly-simplified dialogue and overused examples.
Despite its flaws, the film’s overall story charms in its depiction of generational intersections. Even though the film orbits around the cell phone as a symbolic object, the bond between generations is built on shared values and experiences, seen in Craig becoming Mr. Harrington’s best friend after reaching out to him every week for years. Therefore, the film’s messaging is able to surpass some of the flaws in dialogue and messaging that hinders its effectiveness. Though the film is not the best of those reflected from King’s novels, the movie has promise that should not be overlooked by King fans and other viewers alike.

The touching, poignant, and tragic music video for the song “Money” by Atlanta and Dreamville rapper JID was released on Sept. 29. JID’s latest album “The Forever Story” was released on Aug. 26 to critical and commercial acclaim. This long-awaited follow up to his sophomore album “DiCaprio 2” has cemented his place as one of the current generation’s best rappers, in terms of both popularity and artistic merit. His new music video, directed by Chad Tennies and Mac Grant, has only added to this project's success.
The video opens with a sitcom-esque title card as the song’s wistful choral lines grow into the song’s full beat. This leads the listener into the video’s nostalgic, melancholic and innocent mood, centering on the childlike exploration of its two main characters.
The use of smash cuts and panning shots effectively cut together tne adventures in the lives of two brothers whose loving and affectionate relationship shines as the emotional center of the piece. They are shown exploring the world, scrounging up dollar bills and coins from vending machines and wishing fountains to pay for visits to the arcade and ice cream shop.
This emotional layer is meaningful on its own, but hidden beneath the rose-colored nostalgia of the brothers’ relationship is the harsh reality of their mother’s neglect. We see the older boy bathe his younger brother and feed him bologna sandwiches as JID references the same food in the lyrics, ending with the insightful line “ironic being broke is an expensive lifestyle.”
The music then cuts out as JID says “No wonder they selling dope from sun rose to sundown,” foreshadowing the heart-wrenching final scene of the video. The video then returns to innocent childhood fun, once again creating a charming homage to childhood movies with goofy freeze frames of joyful moments, centering the complex beauty of childhood that JID is commenting on.
But as the music fades out the inherent pain that is imbued into this video returns. The last chorus is replaced by siren wails and crickets as the older boy fails to wake his mother up. The camera pans out to a body being carted off in an ambulance as the two boys talk to a social service agent.
The “Money” music video layers meaning on top of the song's nostalgic mood and underlying focus on parental neglect and drug abuse, creating an emotionally affecting and beautiful narrative that makes the already poignant song even more captivating.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taylor Swift has decided that if she can’t sleep, neither will her fans. Well before the release of her much anticipated 10th album “Midnights,” Swift was already busy scattering breadcrumbs of the music for fans to decode later. In Swift’s NYU commencement speech, she recited unreleased song lyrics from the unannounced album, and in an Instagram caption promoting the soundtrack to an Amazon Prime TV show, she included the suspiciously spaced: “at m i d n i g h t!” Swift and her fans enjoy these Easter egg hunts that invite wild speculation and conspiracy — sure to keep one up past midnight.
But on Swift’s 10th effort, there’s no such writhing. Despite being described by Swift as a concept album of “The 13 sleepless nights, scattered throughout my life,” Swift has never sounded more assured. “Midnights”’s sound exists somewhere between Swift's previous four efforts, capping off the last half of her career defined by albums where she has collaborated closely with producer Jack Antonoff. As a sonic culmination of these past four works, its sound is successfully muted, more palatable and reserved than ambitious. This might be strategy: With Swift’s foray into folk-ier sounds over the past two years, “Midnights” is her soft-launch back to pop.
But unlike her previous pop work, Swift keeps the calm she found in “Folklore.” On the shimmering “Karma” — whose name has sparked lost album conspiracies of Atlantis proportions in the past — Swift sings resolutely about how her past decisions have granted her a life she enjoys. On “Sweet Nothings” she’s tuning out celebrity clamor for the hum of her boyfriend in the kitchen. For an album purportedly about unease, there’s a newfound peace; Swift has made her bed and sounds happy to sleep in it.
This ease carries over to Swift’s writing, too. While her most recent folk-adjacent albums displayed a new depth of writerly ability with well examined characters and intricately packed lyrics, “Midnights” takes a casual, sometimes dropped-in approach. Swift’s less burdened by the pressure to prove her lyrical prowess on “Midnights,“ opting for ambience over explanation. This less labored style doesn’t always pay off, though: rhyming “funny” with “money” on “You’re On Your Own, Kid” or “tears” with “years” on “Karma” stunt ascending bridges. The lead single “Anti-Hero” has an entertaining, TikTok ready chorus, but the verse lyrics have also gone viral for their clunkiness.
This shake up in lyrical density leaves listeners with whiplash; it’s a slow realization that Swift might be having fun for real this time. And as a self-diagnosed try-hard, it’s refreshing to hear Swift let loose and write music that doesn’t need the listener to search for its brilliance through metaphors and plot twists. Swift explores motifs over fully fleshed out stories in “Maroon” where she waxes monochromatic over warm synths. It’s a darker, matured update of “Red”’s title track. Similarly, in “Labyrinth,” metaphors seek to elaborate on its misty, sonic drifting. “Midnight Rain” fuses concise lyricism with a catchy, vocally warped chorus, where a star beam of a synth stands in for the titular rain, and verses with handpicked imagery of pageant queens and peppermint candy thread together to make a constellation. It’s in moments like this where “Midnights” finds luminosity, combining her textured writing of spangling pop tunes with new nonchalance.
Swift is moving with less of the concern or self-consciousness that drove much of her earlier works, like “Lover“ or “Reputation.” She doesn’t abandon all of her nervous impulses, though. Still, on “Lavender Haze,” Swift jumps to address public perceptions of herself. The song’s contagious, pulsating landscape of distorted voices and staccatoed Haim sister delivery is undercut by a bridge that reads as the performance of being unperturbed — a subdued residual of “Shake it Off.” “Anti-Hero” tackles other narratives she can’t be excluded from, employing the “Blank Space” method of taking on negative media depictions as a persona, which she delights in in the accompanying music video.
Other familiar characters from Swift’s repertoire make an appearance on “Midnights” as well. “Vigilante Shit” retreads “Reputation’s” villain role with less of a heavy hand. Swift’s villain persona comes off more endearing than threatening, and the result is a song that would fit well on a musical about Billie Eilish.
Other tracks round out the album's glinted soundscape, building on their surroundings both sonically and thematically. “Question…?”’s bouncy, sing-songy chorus reflects on Swift’s relationship what-if’s with more resolve than past tracks that focus on this theme. “Bejeweled,” written with the same glitter gel pen as “Gorgeous,” is a crystalline confection with little interest in profundity. “Snow On the Beach” puts Swift two-for-two in unconventional Christmas songs, alongside “‘tis the damn season.”
In its 44 minute runtime, “Midnights” casts light on a Swift who’s more resolved and less interested in proving anything about herself. One might call her restful, which directly contradicts the premise of the album. This is where Swift’s scheming comes back in. Three hours after Midnight’s release, Swift released seven bonus tracks on the “3am Version.” This is where the conceptual aspect of the album, the tossing and turning, comes into full view, with sounds decidedly messier and lyrics less assured, disrupting the songs that were thought to be put to bed three hours earlier. Any longtime Swiftie should have known that “Midnights” is a confident hour for Swift; it’s the single-digits that prove to torment her. The contrast between “Midnights” and its “3am Version,” provides that trajectory of a night unsettled.
In the witching hour after “Midnights”’s release, Swift demonstrates her love for trickery and self-dubbed chaos seen earlier in her cat-and-mouse release games. The bonus tracks are Swift’s final moment to shake her listeners back awake, making a game of insomnia. Just like in “Mastermind,” the fake-out last track of the album — with arpeggiated droplets sure to please the ASMR enthusiasts — Taylor Swift proves that, at every hour, she is thinking ahead, making moves in the dark.

“I honestly feel like our music fits really well with Boston’s weather,” lead singer Woosung of The Rose told a crowd of fans — nicknamed Black Roses — after performing “She’s In The Rain.” With a balanced mix of lightheartedness and sensibility, the aptly titled “HEAL TOGETHER” concert provided a therapeutic space with its setlist that journeyed from heart-wrenching rock over joyful pop escapism to ballads about true healing.
The Rose is a South Korean pop-rock band that sings in Korean and English. The group is composed of members Woosung, Dojoon, Hajoon, and Jaehyeong. Their current world tour featuring their first full-length album “HEAL” comes after a three-year hiatus due to the members’ completion of Korea’s mandatory military service as well as the termination of their contract with J&Star Company.
After this long and tumultuous time of waiting that led many fans to fear The Rose’s disbandment, both The Rose and Black Roses were clearly overjoyed by their reunion. Huge black roses filled the stage as props, and the band and fans handed each other roses, the symbol of the band’s simultaneously sweet and thorny music.
The concert started with some of the band’s most heart-wrenching songs such as “Insomnia” and the fan-favorite “She’s In The Rain” which had the crowd singing along with Woosung: “You wanna hurt yourself / I’ll stay with you / You wanna make yourself / Go through the pain / It’s better to be held / Than holding on.”
Woosung, who is also a solo artist, possesses one of the most distinctive voices in the K-pop industry. His crystal-clear falsetto and the deliberately quivering and exceptional agility of his voice combined with an engaging stage presence, create a rock-star package that was a delight to behold. The Rose’s other members were in no way inferior to their charismatic frontman and each showed their mastery over multiple instruments.
The setlist then shifted toward upbeat pop-rock with “California” and “Red” that had both performers and audience dancing away their stress and worries. As the stage lights bathed the hall in red and Black Roses turned their lightsticks the same color, Roadrunner became a warm, blissful hideaway.
The band then played more of its new album “HEAL.” The most emotional song of the album and concert was the ballad “See-Saw,” written by Jaehyeong during his compulsory South Korean military service. “Hi, it's me here / I'm fine / Don't worry / What I want to hear the most / Emotions all day long / It’s going up and down,” Jaehyeong sang with his eyes closed and voice trembling with emotion. All of Roadrunner’s lights were turned off, underscoring his loneliness and isolation. Yet, in a truly touching moment, Black Roses responded by lighting up the hall with a sea of flashlights.
On the stage’s screen, The Rose showed an excerpt of the video documentation “The HEAL Project | Episode 2,” where Woosung said, “When someone has a problem or worries, I don’t think we have the power to directly solve these issues. Nobody has that kind of power. Because everyone has to solve these problems themselves. But what I can do is stay at someone’s side.” As he read the lyrics Jaehyeong had written, he wanted to comfort and reply to him, so the second verse turns the song into a dialogue: “Hello, it's me / I'm here / And you're okay / Don't worry / What do you want to hear the most? / I'll do it for you all day / With no ups and downs.” With brilliant songwriting, the see-saw metaphor — originally illustrating emotional imbalance — is reinterpreted: “Like a see-saw with different ends / I'll relieve the weight off you, slowly, little by little.”
“See-Saw” epitomizes The Rose’s message of healing. Healing cannot happen in isolation, it comes slowly by sharing our stories and staying by someone’s side. For The Rose, this also means interacting closely with their fans. During the sweet ballad “I.L.Y.,” Woosung gestured towards Black Roses as he sang “I love you, our love is true.” He also asked the technicians to turn on all of Roadrunner’s lights to read the fans’ creative signs, which was a funny and heart-warming interlude.
Before performing their debut song “Sorry,” which is still the band’s most popular hit, they reminisced on their humble beginnings: “Nobody knew us, we were giving out candies for people to come to our show,” Woosung shared. The audience, passionately singing along in (more or less accurate) Korean, clearly reciprocated The Rose’s gratitude for coming so far.
After the last song, the band went off stage for what felt like forever, making Black Roses shout “Encore!” with increasing fervor. Finally, The Rose reappeared to perform “Black Rose,” a song dedicated to their fans, rewarding their wait once again. After promising that they will come back next year, the band concluded an unforgettable evening of collective healing with the words “We Rose You!”

“The Watcher,” Netflix’s newest terrifying miniseries, is not just a scary show — the horrifying tale is a real cold case. The miniseries follows Dean and Nora Brannock, a couple based on the real story of Derek and Maria Broaddus, who bought a home in Westfield, New Jersey in June 2014. In “The Watcher,” the family’s beautiful new suburban home soon turns into a nightmare when they begin receiving eerie letters from a person who calls themself “The Watcher.” With their livelihood, safety, and image at stake, Nora (Naomi Watts) and Dean Brannock (Bobby Cannavale) are willing to do anything they can to find out who is terrorizing their lives.
Watts and Cannavale effectively bring to life compelling dialogue and powerful imagery that transforms the series. The miniseries demands more than suspense alone, and both lead actors are outstanding in their increasingly desperate portrayal of parents motivated to do anything to keep their family and home safe. Ultimately, their performances build tension on screen even more than the figure of “the watcher,” as in each horror sequence, the camera focuses mainly on the Brannocks’ faces and their convincing desperation for answers.
Indeed, the miniseries is not just eerie, but suspensefully terrifying. “The Watcher” sets itself apart from other stalker films by focusing on unexpected sources of fear apart from the main antagonist. Throughout the series, the Brannock’s neighbors are a searingly real source of terror. Each of the Brannock’s neighbors plays a distinct role in the feeling of suspense that builds with each episode — the weird, incomprehensible quirks of the characters are simply unnerving. In turn, viewers find themselves not only frightened by a threatening stalker, but uneasy in the scenes of the mysterious neighbors.
Additionally, characters such as Karen Coulhoun (Jennifer Coolidge) give the series a dimension beyond pure horror — an enticing balance of humorous and scary moments allows the miniseries to shine. Coolidge, best known for similar comedic roles, also displays her ability in the horror genre. Through scenes of witty remarks and unapologetic banter, Coolidge initially provides a much-needed comic relief to the otherwise dark series, making her screams of horror at the end of the series that much more effective.
Moreover, the series’s soundtrack successfully creates a lasting sense of unease and uncertainty. Eerie, repetitive tones turn seemingly normal shots into frightening ones, and the show’s simple yet creepy main theme is sure to stay in viewers’ heads longer than they may wish. Thus, the series effectively establishes a murder mystery feel that keep viewers invested in solving the case.
Accordingly, audiences may be disappointed to discover that the mystery of “The Watcher” remains unsolved at the very end of the series, making for an unsatisfying — but lingering — conclusion. Whether it be the author of the letters, the possible neighbor involvement, or questions about the suspicious private investigator, the series offers many possible suspects that viewers can speculate about while watching and after finishing the series. Viewers, undoubtedly fascinated by the cold case, are likely to spend hours thinking and learning more about the Broadduses long after the credits roll.

The heartbeat of Celeste Ng’s novel “Our Missing Hearts” is Margaret Miu, a Chinese American poet who sees her work adopted as the slogan of a protest movement. Perhaps we can see a little bit of Ng reflected in Margaret: Though her previous novels “Little Fires Everywhere” and “Everything I Never Told You” are primarily quiet family dramas that see an implosion from within, Ng seems particularly inspired by the current affairs happening around her, from the increase in violence against Asian Americans, to Covid-19, to the separation of migrant children and their families at the U.S.-Mexico border. The result is a novel set in a dystopian future where an economic depression in the United States is blamed on China, and authorities are allowed to relocate children of dissidents, primarily targeting families of Asian origin. Though Ng sometimes struggles to balance the demands of world-building required by this plot, long-time readers will still recognize and appreciate the masterful way in which she explores the tensions within the Gardner-Miu family, resulting in a majestic novel that is very much relevant to our times.
Set in Cambridge, Massachusetts, “Our Missing Hearts” follows the journey of Bird Gardner, a 12-year old who has grown up with his librarian father, Ethan. His mother, Margaret Miu, is a Chinese American poet who left the family when Bird was nine. Not only that, but Margaret is being investigated by the government for threatening the peace. Bird and his father, in turn, have spent their lives distancing themselves from Margaret’s poetry and trying to fit into their quiet Cambridge existence. It seems to work until Bird (like so many inquisitive young teen protagonists before him) decides to embark on a journey to find his mother and solve the mystery of her disappearance, a journey that leads him to discover the underground resistance movement whose mission is to find the missing children and reunite them with their parents.
Ng chooses to set the novel in Cambridge and New York City, and in anchoring what seems like a dystopian society in these very real places, the reader begins to understand the point that she attempts to make: This haunting vision of a society governed by fear, where children are pawns to be taken away if their parents speak out against the government, is one that is not as far from reality as one might like to think. As Ng describes the way the city shutters during the economic downturn, she may very well be describing society during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic: “People began to lose their cars, then their homes. People began to lose their patience.”
Yet the beauty of the novel does not lie in the social commentary that Ng makes, but rather the way in which she returns to what she did so masterfully in her first two novels: exploring the tensions that simmer below the surface. Perhaps this is where Ng weaves a mammoth task for herself in depicting both simmering societal unrest and the more personal — but in no way less complicated — relationships between Ethan, Margaret and Bird. If practice makes perfect, it is no wonder that the latter is where Ng flexes her writing skills; The exploration of each member of this trio is delightfully nuanced and reminiscent of what made her first two novels so compelling.
The omniscient narrator — another familiar feature from Ng’s previous work — is most effective when it allows for the exploration of the choices that each character faces. Margaret and Ethan wrestle with the unenviable dilemma of protecting the family that they have created and choosing to speak up against the inequalities that have torn apart other families. At one point, Margaret’s desperation and guilt for leaving Bird manifests itself: “She wants to be just his mother for one day. As if she can correct all these years without her, with one golden afternoon.” In this way, Ng blurs the line between the political and the personal, recognizing how simply being Chinese American forces Margaret’s art to be politicized against her intentions, and exploring the pain and privilege that her position as a Chinese American artist necessitates.
“Our Missing Hearts” — admittedly with some degree of self-interest — empowers writers by emphasizing how the arts can inspire revolution and create change. Yet Ng avoids a maudlin wheedling on the value of the arts by choosing to focus instead on another question: What is the price of making art and making change, and is it always worth paying? A definitive conclusion is never drawn, and ultimately, the readers are the ones who are left to ponder this question long after the novel reaches its conclusion.

On Oct. 12, the Grolier Poetry Book Shop held a reading that featured four poets: Susana H. Case, Aaron Caycedo-Kimura, Margo Taft Stever, and Mervyn Taylor. Each poet possessed a distinct voice and spoke to different elements of the contemporary social and political landscape.
People of all ages made up the small crowd in the Grolier’s tight quarters. Audience members young and old conversed freely with one another before the reading began.
Poet Mark Pawklak opened the reading with an introduction, providing background information on each of the poets and welcoming the guests that attended virtually. Margo Taft Stever followed Pawlak’s introduction with words about her involvement in the poetry community, including her work at the Hudson Valley Writers Center and Slapering Hol Press, both of which she founded.
Susana Case, with eight books of poetry to her name, read first. She read mainly from her latest book “The Damage Done,” a murder story in verse. Set in the FBI counterintelligence program era of the 1960s and 1970s, the book follows a protagonist that dies at the beginning of the narrative. She also read from her anthology about Marilyn Monroe that she curated with Stever, titled “I Want To Be Loved by You.” Case also read a poem that she contributed to the anthology titled “Atomic Blonde.” This poem portrayed the tragedy of a soured relationship that ended in divorce. In all of her work, Case faces tragedy directly.
Aaron Caycedo-Kimura followed Case, reading from his new book “Common Grace.” The majority of the poems he read explored the nature of his family history and connection. He discussed his parents’ immigration from Japan, their emotionally distant form of parenting, and his navigation of their deaths. His poems tended to follow certain formal structures, including a couple of sonnets and a pantoum, though he playfully manipulated these forms. A painter as well as a poet, Caycedo-Kimura captured the artistic experience in his poem “In the Studio,” gliding between lightness and heavy grief.
Margo Taft Stever read from her latest poetry collection, “End of Horses.” Her poems reflected on the ecological destruction resulting from climate change, as well as social and political upheaval. She opened with passionate words about Roe v. Wade, then moved into her discussion of the sixth extinction. She preceded each poem with context about its content — often an unfortunate fact about the impending extinction of a certain species. Like Case, Stever read a poem from the “I Want To Be Loved by You” anthology titled “Beauty Parlor.” Impassioned and persuasive, Stever described the most pressing contemporary problems with emotion and urgency.
Mervyn Taylor read last from his most recent poetry collection “News of the Living.” Many of his poems focused on the immigrant experience, police violence, and the poetry wrapped up in ordinary experiences. He made the most ordinary moments seem significant, including going to the laundromat. Taylor engaged the audience with his nuanced commentary and spirited reading style.
The event accommodated all levels of Covid-19 comfort, offering a virtual option and requiring masks in person. Audience member Aline A. Dolinh mused about the future of live poetry reading in a post-pandemic landscape. “Obviously, like, it feels a little strange to have some people watching from a screen,” she said. “I think there is something to be said for being able to be in a room with other people… We've been able to make these things happen and, you know, meet people where they're at and make reasonable accommodations. And I see poetry, I don't know, hopefully continuing along the same path of that kind of openness and accessibility.”
In person, poetry lovers filled the book shop. Carmellite J. Chamblin, on the board of directors for the New England Poetry Club, said, “I love poetry, and I'm really big fan of the Grolier reading series so I tend to attend it often.”
The strength of the Boston-area poetry community showed its face in the Grolier Poetry Book Shop, with people convening to support one another and appreciate creative work in a group setting.
Dolinh put it best when she said, “It's nice to feel like I'm part of a community.”

“Like Hann said, being funny in a foreign language…isn’t our war & peace. This is our collection of polaroids,” lead singer of The 1975 Matthew “Matty” Healy said in their Spotify Storyline for their most recent album release, referencing a comment from the band’s lead guitarist Adam Hann. The band released their fifth album, “Being Funny in a Foreign Language,” on Oct. 14, and though it may not be their most musically powerful body of work, the project stays true to the group’s unique sound and will likely satisfy listeners who have been eagerly awaiting its arrival.
The album is reflective, but in a way that focuses on how we look at the present moment; the current social climate is essential to how the band views their lives and past experiences. The band first formed when its members were around 13 years old, and now that they’re still together at 33, they function in many ways as one solo artist, Healy said in his interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music. It is having gone through so many experiences together that now enables them to create a cohesive sound, successfully addressing how they feel about themselves and society at this moment.
The band opens every album with a self-titled track, “The 1975,” meant to be a “status update” on where they’re at in their lives, as explained in the Storyline. On “Being Funny in a Foreign Language,” their latest version of that iconic first track conveys anxiety and chaos. Rushed piano and fragmented lyrics relate to the seemingly fast paced, frenzied present world. On the opening track, they repeat “I’m sorry if you’re livin’ and you’re 17,” highlighting a theme upheld throughout the album, that younger generations in particular have to struggle with the current problems in society. Towards the end of the song, the guitar slows down and brass instruments come in — the band wants to slow down and talk about these feelings, observe them in the present, and that’s how they frame the rest of the album.
From here, they address the idea of being sincere in relationships. “Happiness,” “Oh Caroline,” and “I’m in Love with You” are naively blissful. They seem shallow on the surface, using upbeat, EDM-sounding guitar and simple lyrics like “I’m in love with you” to explore the moment in a relationship when you love someone and want to make that work. Though they’re simple, they get straight to the point intentionally to convey the sincerity behind expressing exactly what you want and how you feel.
When first writing “I’m in Love with You,” Healy was trying to write “I’m NOT in love with you,” and couldn’t make the lines work, he said in the Storyline. Guitaris Hann told him to not avoid being positive and write what he really feels, prompting Healy to be authentic in this nearly too-catchy track.
“All I Need to Hear” is perhaps the album’s saddest track in tone. It’s guided by a slow bass and wistful guitar that chimes in between lyrics. However, both this and their upbeat tracks uphold the idea of being honest in love. In his interview with Lowe, Healy stated “Tell me you love me ‘cause that’s all I need to hear” is the moment he’s most earnest on the album. Through the heartache and honest desire in the song, it communicates a yearning for love, which has been prevalent on every album from The 1975.
Musically, the album fits well into the band’s typical sound. It ranges from more pop, happy sounds, to deeply sad, slow tracks, and a few reflective and wistful tracks in a sweet spot in between. Be that as it may, this is possibly their most standard album in terms of structure. In their other albums, there are purely instrumental tracks, hidden tracks, and tracks featuring incoherent melodies. There’s often some meaning, and the die-hard fans will dig through these for gems, but keeping it down to 11 conventional songs will appeal to a broader audience and put their loyal fans at ease.
The first single from the album, “Part of the Band,” furthers the idea that listeners are experiencing a snapshot into this moment in time for the band. Journaling was an inspiration for Healy on the track, according to his statements on the Spotify Storyline. The lyrics seem to reference brief snippets into different moments of his life. He makes references to his “cancellations,” referring to a past controversy over allegedly putting himself at the center of discourse on police brutality by tweeting lyrics from one of their own songs in 2020 in response to the murder of George Floyd.
He also mentions his “heroin binges,” current sobriety, falling in love, and dealing with the internet. In the final verse, he sings, “Am I ironically woke? The butt of my joke? Or am I just some post-coke, average, skinny bloke? Calling his ego imagination?” Thinking about his past brings him to a present filled with contemplating where he fits into the greater scheme of the world, but in a witty and funny way that Healy is known for.
“Human Too” also addresses some of the themes of cancellation, but in a broader sense; Healy said he feels young people set “moral, political, social standards” that will only lead to disappointment, according to the Storyline. While the song is a bit dull musically, too mellow, and not very rhythmic, it argues for empathy with a message that is essential to the overall meaning of the album.
“About You” is an example of The 1975’s sweet spot between sounding happy and expressing nostalgia. In the Storyline, the band states it’s a “musical continuation” of “Robbers,” a fan-favorite off their self-titled debut 2013 album. A guitar reverb hooks the listener, the most obvious parallel to “Robbers.” However, “About You” is dreamier and there’s much more going on instrumentally than its 2014 predecessor, from saxophone to layered guitars, making the hook less prominent. The song also features vocals from Hann’s wife, Carly Holt. A duet is rare for The 1975 though not unheard of, and Holt’s voice complements Healy’s, both surreal, and this song is where Healy’s voice sounds the best on the album. His refrain “Do you think I have forgotten about you?” and Holt’s “I think about you” represent two nostalgic lovers stating how they think about each other after time has passed.
“This record, we wanted to let people be a witness to something a bit more; so the last album was going to see ‘Transformers’ at the IMAX, this is like going to see a play,” Healy explained to Lowe. The 1975 chooses to be authentic to themselves on their fifth album and succeeds more than ever. By lyrically highlighting their various emotions through snippets into moments and impulses, the band has improved their ability to be introspective and allow listeners to understand exactly how they feel.

“Martian: The Saint of Loneliness” is a poetry collection brimming with confidence, voice, and presence; it firmly plants its feet, unafraid to be seen or heard, for better or for worse. It is through this shamelessness that award-winning author and poet James Cagney delivers his art, an exhibition of autobiographical vignettes, artistic musings, historical exposés, and bold calls to action that confront the reader with unavoidable introspection. Expert wordplay, constrained breaks in convention, and varied form allow Cagney to explore themes of loneliness and isolation, the legacy of slavery and colonization, and love and passion with a deftness of pen that is by no means light — the collection remains a heavy read from cover to cover.
The star of this work, by far, is the visual artistry of Cagney’s poetry. Honoring his promise to “paint with words,” each poem is designed to be more than just words on the page. Artistic embellishments and unconventional punctuation give Cagney’s poetry a visual flair; akin to a physical artwork, his poems are curated displays rather than rhythmic creations. Spaces of varying length replace commas, and even periods, in poems like “Her Majesty Queen Sophie,” favoring visual artistry over traditional rhythmic form, and creating greater nuance. Not all pauses are equal, but how does the reader make that distinction? The difference between four spaces and seven conveys in precise detail the intended breath.
At the same time, abstract imagery dots the pages of this collection, such as the bullet holes in “Bullet Gumbo,” which often take the place of traditional punctuation — notably bullet points — and underscore the inherent visual nature of this work. Cagney’s protest pieces read like modern art on a gallery wall, while narrative excerpts from his childhood are pastoral landscapes of a human life. This is by no means a criticism of his poems on adolescence — the words are never stagnant, just still. Given that many of these poems originated from a literary interpretation of visual art, including “Phantom Pain” and “Love is Easier the Headless Way,” it should come as no surprise that Cagney’s poetic form frequently reflects his aesthetic inspirations.
Visual art is not the only place from which Cagney derives his muse. Part of the brilliance of this collection stems from a rearrangement of and creative borrowing from others’ writing. “Boys and Stranger” was conceived from Cagney’s “much too personal an essay to publicly share,” “Found in America: Bad Apples” is an arrangement of select words and phrases from other texts, otherwise known as a found poem, and “Between a Rock Wall and an Immigrant” draws from both a poem by Allen Ginsberg and a song by Eddie Jefferson. Art births new art, and this life cycle of creative thought is precisely what makes this poetry not only relatable, but familiar.
This collection benefits from structural as well as aesthetic variety. It strikingly pushes boundaries of poetic form not by writing without form, but rather by creating new structure, and riffing on existing poetic paradigms. “If You See Something,” though it may seem randomly arranged, is actually highly structured; the structure is just of Cagney’s own invention, for which he generously provides instructions in the “notes & acknowledgements” section of the book: “Write a stanza of 4-5 lines, then blow up and reconstruct that stanza four more times, pushing and varying word use as needed.” This procedurally unstructured form provides the collection with another source of uniqueness and variety, making it stand out in a vast sea of modern poetry.
Not every stand-out, however, is for the better. Sometimes the poetry is dense: a wall of text that requires word-by-word dissection. While artful in its own right — sometimes consuming art requires work — this complexity takes away from the reader’s ability to see the big picture in select poems, like “Her Majesty Queen Sophie.” Instead, the reader must toil over the author’s craft. In other cases, however, this collection infantilizes its reader, with a reading guide at the end of the book complete with analysis questions and writing prompts reminiscent of a grade-school classroom. Sufficient background on the poetry is provided in the notes at the end of the book: A reading guide cannot help but read as excessive, unnecessary, and a dampener to the authentic artistic experience.
Still, this poetry collection leaves no deficit of fantastic craft. Once the reader is able to wade through the ocean of praise and forewords that shield the true beginning of this book, what awaits on the other side is well worth it. With a brazen, full-frontal attack of delicate and timely themes, what other collection has the audacity to ask “Could murder be a form of art?” Mold-breaking poetic and visual structure underscores an impressive dissection of what it means to make art in America; the book itself provides a brilliant example, giving the reader an insight into the author’s personal life, all the while framing an insightful callout of America and all who are complicit in its systems of oppression.

The stage is packed with captivated musical onlookers, their faces glowing as if they were staring into the warmest of sunsets. Tears shine in the eyes of some as their awe-struck gazes are fixed on the figure at the center: she sits on a throne in front of a golden microphone, smiling out from under her signature beret crown. This was the scene of Joni Mitchell’s surprise performance at the 2022 Newport Folk Festival, a vibrant and emotional sunset to Mitchell’s illustrious career.
Modern singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile invited Mitchell back to the Newport Folk stage this year for the first time since 1967, bringing the Canadian-American singer’s musical legacy back to the forefront of the public stage. Though Mitchell no longer regularly performs for the public, her recent recognitions at events like the Newport Folk Festival call for renewed reflections on her influence in the modern musical realm.
With vocals as beautifully crystalline as her lyrics, Joni Mitchell is a standout. Her commercial career began in 1968 with her debut album entitled “Song to a Seagull.” Since then, her outsider perspective on the music industry reflected an uncommon freedom to create and define musical expression through unconstrained sound. Her one-of-a-kind guitar tuning and unexpected melodies weave with beautifully poignant lyrics in her songs, crafting an iridescent window into the human experience.
Mitchell’s talent as a musician and poet garnered acclaim during her career, yes, but it’s her willingness to steep her music in the full range of humanity that has redefined the power of the artist and inspired countless others. Her discography explores the dissonance between themes like domestic contentment and a yearning for independence, commenting on the nuances of conversations between love, life, and social issues. In the same year as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young released “Our House,” itself inspired by Mitchell and Graham Nash’s Laurel Canyon romance, Joni released “The Arrangement” as a critique of traditional domestic arrangements. “Our house is a very, very, very fine house,” Nash sings in “Our House” of the home he shared with Mitchell. “Life used to be so hard / Now everything is easy ‘cause of you.”
And yet, even as she inspires Nash’s tribute to an idealized life of settling down, Mitchell sings of her doubts of this lifestyle: “While you still have the time / You could get away and find / A better life.” This commitment to exploring the uncomfortable flipsides to social convention has established her influence not only as an exceptional artist, but also as a piercing social commentator.
The reach of Joni Mitchell’s messages is not in spite of her status as an artist. Rather, her position extended and empowered her influence in activism. Her 1970 release “Big Yellow Taxi” quickly took root as an iconic soundtrack for environmental movements. The line “they paved paradise and put up a parking lot” has proved a timeless defining phrase for climate activists from the 1970s to the 2020s.
The long-lasting influence of her social commentary isn’t just confined to environmentalism, either — her music and advocacy maintains relevance by touching on ever-present issues like the Vietnam War and anti-war statements, commercialized complacency in the music industry, and even responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.
In a 2021 statement of solidarity with the “global scientific and medical communities” and other artists like Neil Young, Mitchell removed her music from the streaming platform Spotify over accusations of its role in spreading pandemic-related misinformation through its continued platforming of public figure Joe Rogan’s controversial podcast.
Joni Mitchell’s use of her stage to call for change is echoed in the actions of the modern artists she’s inspired, further perpetuating her impact in the modern sphere. From Prince’s advocacy for diplomacy in his 1981 track “Ronnie, Talk to Russia” to Harry Styles’s onstage shows of support for the LGBTQ+ community, Mitchell’s style of creative activism is kept alive by the artists she’s influenced.
In addition to her mastery of musical mobilization, Mitchell’s versatility in style allows her music to exert its force on a wide variety of artists. Throughout, she refused to allow her career to be defined by a single genre: she strayed from her folk roots to explore jazz in collaboration with famed jazz artist Charles Mingus, and later dove into pop and rock sounds. It’s no wonder, then, that her circle of influence extends from such differing artists as Prince to Harry Styles to Brandi Carlile and beyond.
Joni Mitchell’s musical themes transcend boundaries of time. Her ever-invigorating musical style inspires generations of musicians hoping to pick up where she leaves off, and her songs will continue to function as anthems against injustice as long as injustice remains. The emotional response elicited by Joni Mitchell’s surprise appearance at the Newport Folk Festival is no shock: modern music has Mitchell to thank. Her legacy is not trapped in the side of the past, but, to quote Joni Mitchell, in the musical footprints of “Both Sides Now.”

“Requiem for the Enslaved,” an album composed by Carlos Simon, was performed for the first time to a live audience on Sunday, Oct. 9 by spoken word artist Marco Pavé, Boston-based quartet Hub New Music, trumpet player Jared “MK Zulu” Bailey, and Simon himself on piano. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum hosted the world premiere as part of its Weekend Concert Series, where it welcomes classical musicians to perform on Sunday afternoons in its four-story Calderwood Hall. (For articles on past Weekend Concert Series events, click here.)
Simon, an assistant professor at Georgetown University, was commissioned by the university to compose the musical piece in honor of the 272 enslaved individuals who were sold by the Maryland Province of Jesuits in 1838. As explained in the event’s program, the album “features music that evokes the spirit of those in captivity” and “artistically explores the sacred and historical ideology of the sale of those enslaved by Jesuits.” The concert featured a range of styles that moved listeners and engaged them with every note and line of spoken word.
Simon made this clear to the audience after the show, when he outlined the motivations of the musical project.
“I had two objectives with this piece: to honor those men, women and children who were property, and to shine a light on systemic racism,” Simon said. “There’s no way we can talk about racism today without talking about slavery.”
To accomplish his goals, Simon reached out to Pavé, a hip-hop artist and social activist based in Washington, D.C., to write and perform spoken word in the piece. Amidst the height of the pandemic, Pavé and Simon worked on the album by sending audio clips back and forth to one another.
The concert began with a pre-recorded recitation of the names of the enslaved people sold by Georgetown’s founders, from adult men to young children. In between Simon’s original songs, the musicians reprised the tunes of ‘Swing Low, Sweet Chariot’ and the Gregorian Chant throughout the 45 minute work. The fusion of an African American spiritual and Catholic requiem along with hip-hop lyrics created an entirely new sound and a unique listening experience.
After the performance, the musicians held a question-and-answer section during which Simon solicited reflections and questions from audience members. Hub New Music founder and flutist Michael Avitabile, also had the opportunity to share his thoughts.
“It’s just been a privilege to be a part of this and for [Simon] to trust us to tell this story with [him]. It’s really, really powerful,” Avitabile said.
Pavé also took a moment to describe his creative process, which included intermittent spoken word sections blended seamlessly into musical interludes. Intended to juxtapose the sounds of the quartet and the piano, Pavé’s lines included both original work and the words of Frederick Douglass.
“This whole process was completely different for me — the content of it was super deep,” Pavé said. “I was having dreams, ancestors coming to me, speaking to me, telling me different stories of what happened to them. I went to the grounds of the Underground Railroad Museum in Memphis and just sat there with the spirits of that energy to really bring the energy of the project to life.”
The piece comes at a time when other major institutions are grappling with the legacy of slavery on their campuses. At Harvard, the Report of the Presidential Committee on the Legacy of Slavery detailed the university’s past contributions to racial injustice and its future plans for reparations. With “Requiem for the Enslaved,” Simon strove to acknowledge those affected by slavery in a unique and meaningful way, uniting artistic styles in a single performance at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. It is available to stream on YouTube and Apple Music.

Grolier Poetry Book Shop was lit with warm neutral tones on the evening of Oct. 7. The storefront window was lined with a row of succulents and flower pots, and the doorbell chimed with every gust of the early October wind. In the front of the room, the poet Chen Chen flipped over a page and began to read the first lines from his latest collection, “Your Emergency Contact Has Experienced An Emergency.”
Chen’s new collection dissects inheritance and family, exploring both themes through a queer Asian American lens. The back of the book poses the question, “What happens when everything falls away, when those you call on in times of need are themselves calling out for rescue?” The book is an elegy and devotion to previous creators, drawing inspiration from Asian American poets such as Justin Chin and Marilyn Chin. Chen’s writing revels in different shades and mixes of emotions, vibrating with joy and sorrow, teeming with humor and sensuality.
Throughout the reading, the Grolier was almost always surrounded by life, whether that be paper rustling, soft laughter, or the scratching of pencil as audience members jotted down quotes and notes. After each poem, the audience members snapped their fingers or gave a small nod or hum of respect. Many of them were students, writers, and fellow dreamers, gathered together to both learn and experience through literature.
Every so often Chen paused from reading and cracked a joke. “Thank god for a table of contents,” Chen said while trying to find his next poem to read, causing a couple audience members to chuckle. His playful personality extends to his poetry. Chen holds the reader’s attention while crafting worlds where God steers a magenta rowboat and the wind kisses another wind. “I never feel crowded out by Chen,” said Eben Bein, one of his former students and the person who introduced Chen’s work. “More like he’s just pushing the fabric of space time aside as a way for me to experience other dimensions, like the kind where spooky babes live.”
The only time the room fell silent was after the reading of the poem “Elegy While Listening to a Song I Can’t Help But Start to Move to,” a piece dedicated to the Pulse Nightclub shooting. In the poem, Chen surrounds the reader with images of joy and longing, contrasting queer freedom and love with the tragedy of the event. “Their singing along / their jokes / their swoon-worthy move,” he read, his tone urgent and fervent, and he continued to describe the speaker discovering their sexuality, “I’ve sculpted the air / into a boy: / Jake B. who / sits across in History / I feel finally inside / my own face.” When Chen recited the last line, “Their laughter / I keep hearing their laughter, moments before,” there was no sound from the audience, only the last fragment of a word suspended in the air.
“Chen Chen’s work is a reminder of the joy of living fully and honestly,” said Riya Rana, an audience member. “The main takeaway was to be held in an intimate environment where Chen Chen is fully his beautiful self, which is funny and tender and touching and emotional and sarcastic.”
When asked what was the first word that came to mind after the reading, James Fraser, the shop’s manager, chose “fulfillment.” “One of the things I admire the most of Chen’s poetry is the multitudes that it encompasses and how he isn’t afraid to bring so many different things that other people wouldn’t or couldn’t get into a poem,” he said.
Towards the end of the reading, Chen recited a couple lines from his poem “I will be gone after these brief messages.” His voice, forceful yet clear, propelled each word forward and filled the room with richness and soul. “Life is a joyful thing,” Chen paused and let his eyes drift to the next line. It was quiet enough to hear the creak of the bookshelves, to witness this small world of a room listening, breathing, and grasping for the next lines. “It's probably very good for you.”

One thing became very clear as the night of Sept. 28 unfolded at the Boch Center’s beautiful Wang Theatre: Pavement still rocks. The room was filled with a crowd that stayed on their feet from the moment Pavement took the stage. Singing, screaming, and a consistent group of balcony-dancing fans showed the band love throughout the night; they were rewarded with a fantastic show, complete with the ritual throwing of ping pong balls into the crowd and intermittent reflections from iconic lead vocalist Stephen Malkmus.
A new addition to the band for Pavement’s 2022 reunion tour is Rebecca Cole, a keyboardist who was formerly a member of bands Wild Flag and the Minders. Nastanovich said in an interview with The A.V. Club that she makes them “more versatile.” It was certainly a pleasure to watch her banging on the keyboard while swinging long black hair backlit by spotlights. Pavement sounded better than ever.
The set list incorporated a number of fan favorites, opening with “Grounded” and including “Harness Your Hopes - B-Side,” “Cut Your Hair,” “Range Life,” and “Spit on a Stranger.” It was clear the crowd was filled with people who had been following Pavement for decades; cheering erupted throughout the show in moments of recognition when the audience heard the first notes of a beloved song. They were incredibly excited to share another night with Pavement, who were touring together for the first time in 12 years.
This same love for the band was needed during some of the show’s rougher moments, like when Malkmus began singing the wrong version of lyrics for “Fin” and asked the band to start over. The crowd cheered him on, and the evening was back on track. The roughness of Pavement is part of their magic. Their fans get to witness a living legacy unfold, with the potential for surprise always around the corner.
Embedded in one of the mellow sections of the set was a series of songs Malkmus described as “witchy.” This included “The Hexx,” accompanied by blue and purple lights with a moon-like graphic on the big screen that flashed with different images throughout the show. Though in many instances the graphics were a nice touch, they also felt distracting at times. The lights and Pavement’s unbeatable sound would have been more than enough; a hand cutting an orange and the rotating torso of a naked woman added nothing.
What is always consistent with Pavement is the sheer quality that this group brings to everything they do. Each song was a hit, even when Malkmus had to perform without being able to hear himself due to a technical difficulty. Thoroughly enjoyable to watch was Bob Nastanovich, in classic character, alternating between percussion, vocals, tambourine, and the slide whistle. His haunting screams echoed through the theater during “Half A Canyon” alongside bouts of intensive maraca playing.
Malkmus did not fail to keep the audience captivated. In a beautiful moment early in the set he kneeled to the ground, playing by feel with his head bowed as he cradled the guitar on his knee. His presence in that moment was serene, and stood out as it was free of the humor and rambling stories that characterize his typical stage presence (like the story he told about using what he called “slugs,” to attempt to play free games on pinball machines).
As Pavement returned to the stage for the encore, they killed time waiting for Scott Kannberg, who Malkmus announced in a fake British accent was “visiting the urinal.” Nastanovich quipped, “Never know where he might turn up,” to which Malkmus quickly replied, “Could be an elevator to hell...”
Just before the encore began, band members called out place names to figure out where people in the crowd were from. Loud screams for New Hampshire and Rhode Island showed that fans had been willing to make a trek to watch Pavement perform. The sea of contented faces that left the Boch Center that night made it clear that they got exactly what they came for.

During a brisk afternoon on Saturday, Oct. 1, a small crowd congregating in Kendall Square’s Canal District witnessed dancers cloaked in neutral fabrics warming up in preparation for an hour-long performance that would stretch along the Charles River on Cambridge Parkway until concluding in Cambridge Common. The moving performance was far from traditional.
Aptly titled “Emotive Land,” this project by Boston arts collective The Click blended the natural environment with augmented reality. Alongside a live performance, “Emotive Land” featured pre-recorded routines accessible through an app which allowed passersby to calibrate their location and view a dance set in their current environment.
During the launch, attendees could alternate between viewing dancers in-person and through their smartphones. Project co-creator Lonnie Stanton provided commentary for the contemporary dance regarding the significance of the physical space — a heavily industrial, commercial area with the central backdrop of the Charles River. Stanton highlighted the branches growing through the canal grates and weeds emerging from the sidewalk — the endurance of nature and the ways humans interact with it.
“That's what I think we should all be looking to: How to adapt. How nature has,” Stanton said.
While observing the dancers twist through trees or against railings, Stanton emphasized the autonomy of dances and audience members alike.
“I love the idea of putting dance out here without the boundaries,” she said. “Whether it’s tape and a chalk line or a stage that’s built up on the grass, that doesn’t interest me. And so I like the blurred boundaries.”
The “Emotive Land” app enabled audience members to wander around and face away from the live dancers while experiencing augmented reality.
“Emotive Land” co-creator Kristin C. Wagner, who also participated as a dancer in this launch, explained that inspiration for this project struck during the pandemic. Wagner revealed that a portion of the performance took place along her typical running route, where she imagined kayakers on the Charles River could observe a dance from the water.
Technological execution proved difficult, however. For instance, all the dances filmed for the app had to be performed against a green screen, which performer Alexandria K. Nunwelier noted was atypical.
“We had to compact the movement for the size of our green screen so it could live bigger once it’s on the phone, in a way,” Nunwlier said.
Wagner similarly found the experience unusual.
“It really struck me that day that I was in an incredibly manufactured environment, and how ironic that was given the nature of the project and where we were going to end up appearing,” she said.
Still, Nunwelier found that the human element of dance shone through in augmented reality as it featured a “real person and not an animation.”
Moreover, Nunwelier recognized the power of multimedia performances compared to strictly live dance. The app allows any member of the public to view the artwork outside of any time constraint and without any personal expense.
“It allows it to live longer, live more lives than just one day, one time,” Nunwelier said.
The innovative nature of this project — combining humans, the environment, and technology — serves as a sign of the times. In the digital age, there are many ways technology can frame our worldview and livelihood.
“Hold on to your sense of connection to nature and the importance of live [dance], but also, embrace that the world is changing,” Wagner said. “And if you don't accept some tech, you're going to get left behind, and then that doesn't serve anyone either.”
“Emotive Land” is available for download until Nov. 30 through www.theclickboston.com, as well as Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

In a fastly growing K-pop industry where talent is a given, Seulgi is one of the most talented artists right now with a deadly combination of unparalleled skills in singing, dancing, and even drawing with many years of experience. She has become a powerhouse in K-pop by showcasing her soft, sultry vocals and powerful dancing primarily as the lead vocalist and main dancer of Red Velvet, but also in the subunit Irene & Seulgi, and even as a member of the supergroup Got the Beat. But, with the release of her long-awaited solo debut album, “28 Reasons,” the world can experience Seulgi as just Seulgi for the first time, and what a joy it is. Through six beautifully curated and crafted tracks, Seulgi has embraced her darker, mysterious side to capture listeners in a musical journey that challenges them to reflect on the complex coexistence of good and evil.
The excitement for Seulgi’s solo debut started before its release, especially with the drop of the official album teaser. In 1 minute and 28 seconds, the album teaser is packed with explosions, nods to thrillers, and even emotional acting from Seulgi. Fans commented that this album teaser felt more like a Hollywood-esque movie trailer than the typical K-pop teaser music video and praised Seulgi’s artistic vision with the album’s alluring, sinister theme. Thus, the scene was set for “28 Reasons” to become an album that pushes the boundaries of K-pop.
From the first line of the title track and album’s namesake, “28 Reasons,” Seulgi makes it clear that her album is not going to be just any other K-pop album. After four loud bass beats, Seulgi mischievously opens the song with, “I kiss your brother / I steal that heart.” She then goes on to sing lines like, “I’m breaking every rule / I want to keep teasing you” and “You know all 28 reasons to run away / So, why are you leaning on me again.” Together these lyrics convey two contrasting, but perhaps intertwined sides of attraction — pure interest and mischievous intent — similar to how little kids express their interest in someone by being mean to them. Beyond the dramatic lyrics, the instrumentals are surprisingly quite simple. At most, there are only a groovy bass line, a haunting whistle, and arpeggio strings. Thus, the delivery of the complicated lyrics rests solely on Seulgi’s vocals, which she excels at. She’s coy and sultry at times, but powerful too, especially during the acapella portion of the chorus towards the end. “28 Reasons” is a simply addicting song for listeners.
However, the song that displays Seulgi’s best vocals on this album is “Dead Man Runnin’.” Featuring lyrics written by Seulgi herself, “Dead Man Runnin’” expresses the story of someone with past scars warning those who have hurt them in the past. Seulgi ditches all mischievousness from “28 Reasons” and focuses solely on vengeance when embracing this character with complete swagger. She sings in a vocal tone that is grittier than her usual tone and overpowers even the intense bass in the instrumentals. Her vocals build up to the final breaking point at the end of the song, and it is hauntingly glorious.
The third song of the album, “Bad Boy, Sad Girl,” does a complete musical 180 from the villain-esque “Dead Man Runnin’” by featuring Seulgi’s lovely, whimsical vocals and pairing it with Korean rapper Be’O’s similarly brighter tone. The song is like a breath of fresh air on a summer day within the otherwise heavy, darker album. If “Bad Boy, Sad Girl,” represents the summer day, “Anywhere But Home” features summer night drive vibes. Seulgi’s vocals here are more airy and dreamy, floating above the bass rhythm and soft electronic piano riffs. This song is very easy on the ears and should be added to driving playlists immediately.
Through “Los Angeles,” Seulgi adds a new musical style to her growing repertoire — EDM pop dance. The highlight of “Los Angeles” is the musical drop that features bold techno sounds. However, as cool as the drop sounds the first time, it does not feature Seulgi’s vocals, which are perhaps the best elements of the album, and also gets repetitive. Nonetheless, it is a head banger that highlights Seulgi’s willingness to explore different sounds. The final song of the album is “Crown,” which is a regal ending worthy of this phenomenal album. It once again features Seulgi’s powerful vocals, but in a more grandeur manner aided by the expansive instrumentation.
There are more than 28 reasons why Seulgi’s “28 Reasons” is one of the best K-pop releases of the year, but one is the opportunity to experience Seulgi’s artistic brilliance in its fullest and purest form. Seulgi creates the perfect harmony between K-pop’s original roots of simplicity and modern K-pop trends’ sonic dynamism. From the album’s themes to its lyrics, it is evident that Seulgi put a lot of thought and effort into creating a K-pop album like none other. It leaves listeners thinking, if this is what Seulgi can do in just six songs, imagine what more she can do in the future.

On Oct. 6, the Hutchins Center for African and African American Studies honored seven individuals who have worked to advance the African American community with the W.E.B. DuBois Medal — Harvard’s most distinguished award in the discipline of African and African American Studies.
This year’s recipients included NBA Hall of Famer and cultural critic Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, feminist and acclaimed author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, actress and producer Laverne Cox, philanthropist and President Emeritus of the Museum of Modern Art Agnes Gund, business leader Raymond J. McGuire, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, and artist Betye Saar, all of whom took the stage in Sanders Theater to be honored for representing hundreds of years of work toward racial justice.
Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr. — historian, Harvard professor, and current director of the Hutchins Center — hosted the event, accompanied by President Larry Bacow and former 2006 medalist and chair of the Center’s national advisory board Glenn Hutchins. The ceremony was held in person for the first time since 2019, enabling over 300 students from 21 public and independent schools in Boston and Cambridge to attend.
Each speaker delivered moving and emotional speeches about the urgency of advancing equity for Black people, emphasizing how much work must still be done toward this end.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, towering over fellow awardees with a beaming grin, spoke of his connection to the great W.E.B. DuBois. Abdul-Jabbar mentioned that his children recently performed a DNA and ancestry test, revealing that his great uncle was Dr. John Alcindor, a physician and activist who befriended DuBois at the First Pan-African Conference in London. Adbul-Jabbar has followed in these footsteps of excellence by leading the NBA in all-time scoring, authoring columns and best-selling books, and pursuing a career in public service.
Abdul-Jabbar thanked the eponymous DuBois for his foundational anti-racist work.
“DuBois had a great impact on me. He spoke to the deepest part of who I was as an African American… he gave me the words to express what I was thinking about,” Abdul-Jabbar said.
Raymond McGuire — a Harvard College, Business School, and Law School alumnus — spoke to the need for more genuine efforts to advance equity in public service. McGuire, who served as the head of banking for the Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking, has complemented his impressive career in finance by chairing the board of the Studio Museum in Harlem — an institution dedicated to Black art and media.
“Too many people that go into public service are really self-service,” McGuire said.
Laverne Cox — the first openly trasngender person to be nominated for an Emmy award — is likewise the first transgender recipient of the W.E.B. DuBois Medal. Cox is best known for her role on the hit Netflix show “Orange is the New Black.”
In a post-ceremony interview with The Crimson, Cox laid out recommendations for ways young people can contribute to social justice work.
“We need a movement to get money out of politics…The filibuster, abortion rights, voting rights, none of these things can happen because all of our politicians, Democrats and Republicans, have been bought off. We need a grassroots movement from young people to get money out of politics. We have legal bribery in this country,” Cox said.
The speeches clearly resonated with the students and faculty in attendance, including Buckingham Browne & Nichols Upper School faculty member Jade Duval.
“Laverne Cox would have to be my favorite speaker just because of the way people got so excited to hear her speak. I just feel like as someone who’s young and getting into education… I think that it’s important to take notice of Black people who are doing work in media right now,” Duval said.
Cox wasn’t the only recipient who spoke directly to their youthful audience. Deval Patrick — the first Black governor of Massachusetts and a Harvard College and Law School alumnus — passed along a message from his grandmother that he lives by, echoing the optimism of the other speakers.
“Hope for the best and work for it,” Patrick said.

Stepping into the dimly-lit Kirkland Junior Common Room with its opulent armchairs and the elegant paneling feels like entering the 19th century. But on the evenings of Oct. 21 and Oct. 22, following in the footsteps of “Hocodysseus” on his epic “Quadyssey,” courtesy of the Kirkland Drama Society, the room brought to mind the image of ancient Greece with a Harvard spin.
The history of the Kirkland Drama Society’s semesterly productions goes all the way back to the 1930s. Traditionally, the group would be staging Shakespeare, but in recent years, they have ventured into other types of productions, including original plays. This year, they also broke with the mold by putting on the Odyssey-inspired “Quadyssey,” a play that follows Hocodysseus, the House Committee chair from Ithakirk, on his epic trek back home after a night of too much partying that ended up with him stuck in the Quad.
The choice of the play is not an accident. The KDS offers a role to all the Kirklanders who express interest in participating. The number has been steadily increasing in the last couple of semesters, and it rose from 22 a year ago to more than 40 this year. As a result, the production would have to include more than 40 actors — a feat hard to accomplish with a Shakespearean play.
The search for alternatives wasn’t long. “One of our first thoughts was, if we're not going to do something Shakespeare, but we want to keep something that has that same kind of classic cannon weight [it has to be] the Odyssey,” said Samuel Murdock ’23, who plays the main protagonist, Hocodysseus.
The idea to put a spin on Homer’s story was largely accidental. “Sam came up with the idea of making a pun off it to do ‘The Odyssey,’” said Adam V. Aleksic ’23, one of the play’s co-writers. “We were thinking ‘The Quadyssey’ might be a fun play to do because we knew we were going to have a large cast,” he said.
“The good thing about ‘The Odyssey’ is that [Odysseus] is traveling through these different places and meeting all these different people,” Aleksic said. “So we thought, how could we theme all the monsters around Harvard?”
What followed was a hectic time, with less than six weeks between conceptualizing the show in early September and its Oct. 21 premiere. But the tight turnaround was by no means unusual. “That's the KDS tradition. It's always been: you take however long to write it and then you have five days of rehearsal,” said Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor and another of the play’s co-writers.
“We spent a lot of time with a group of very funny people coming up with ideas, and we finished like four days before we started rehearsing,” Aleksic said.
The end result was a distinctly Harvard play, with the monsters becoming BCG — “Beta Kappa Gamma” — recruiters, Delphic lotus eaters, and members of the “Charymson” and “Scalient,” both trying to convince Hocodysseus to join, while arguing if “Plato's Republic” is indeed one of the ten failures “of the radical left.”
The KDS left no stone unturned, touching on what seems like every aspect of Harvard’s traditions and culture, even poking some light-hearted fun at the former Swedish prime minister, and current Institute of Politics fellow, Stefan Löfven, who got a cameo role in the show.
Still, despite its many Harvard references, the play remains firmly centered on Kirkland.
Mariana Juarez ’24, who played the role of Calypso, was initially nervous about participating, but the community aspect took much of the stress off. “The play is for the rest of Kirkland [but] it’s also for us just to enjoy ourselves and have a good time,” she said. “I've already got to talk to so many people in Kirkland that I never got the chance to talk to [before]. So it's been an amazing experience so far.”
Indeed, “The Quadyssey” might have been less about theater, and more about building community and house pride.
“One thing that I love about all KDS plays is the Kirkland pride in the story lines themselves,” said Michelle A. Stegawski ’23, playing the recurring role of Ann Ecdote. “The whole idea is that Hocodysseus is trying to get back to Kirkland … Last semester it was ‘Back to the Future’ and it was all based on getting back to Kirkland.”
She’s not alone in sharing the sentiment. House pride seemed to be a common denominator.
“I think it's one of the times where Kirkland's like has pride and community,” Zimmerman said.
“I think it's my favorite Kirkland tradition,” Aleksic added. “It's what really showcases our strength as a community.”

The crowd erupts in applause. Instantly, thousands are standing, clapping, whistling, and shouting “bravo.” Pianist Yuja Wang — a four-time Grammy Award nominee and recipient of the 2019 Gramophone Instrumental Award — emerges from backstage. Once again, there is a star in town at Symphony Hall.
The night’s performance — showcasing the premiere of a new orchestral work from American composer Julia Adolphe (“Makeshift Castle“), Shostakovich’s First and Second Piano Concertos, and Haydn’s Symphony No. 100 “Military” — encompassed a medley of compositional styles and expressive forms. Undoubtedly, however, the two concertos — which were stylistically disparate and composed 24 years apart — served as the concert’s featured program. Yuja Wang’s excellence breathed new life into Shostakovich’s work, redeeming an otherwise bland performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
Wang’s rendition of Shostakovich’s “Piano Concerto No. 1” was a dazzling and dynamic display. Wang treated the first theme of the opening movement (Allegro moderato) with delicacy and reflection, capturing its pensive, ambivalent mood. She likewise executed the festive second-theme with an obligatory alacrity. The second movement — a languid, solemn Largo — opened with an orchestral introduction that ever-so-slightly lacked interpretive tenderness. Wang’s artful touch pierced through this ample but unimpressive accompaniment with high definition. Each note’s timing, waxing and waning with masterful rubato, imbued the musical texture with a clear but unobtrusive waltz-like quality. BSO principal trumpet Thomas Rolfs’s performed the movement’s lyrical trumpet solo with tact and color, providing a sensitive complement to Wang’s solo.
The concerto’s third and fourth movements — a brief Moderato interlude followed by a racy Allegro con brio — however, did not sparkle with the same gusto. Wang showcased her technical brilliance and boundless energy in both movements. She danced across much of the instrument’s seven-octave range with ease and expressivity, but did not display the interpretive sensitivity that pervaded her performance of the first two movements. By the end of the rhythmically incessant Allegro con brio, the pyrotechnics had overcome musical sensibility, if only for a flashing moment.
Wang’s rendition of Shostakovich’s “Piano Concerto No. 2,” however, was the definition of transcendental. She depicted the first movement — a spirited Allegro — with a clarity and dynamism that defied the limits of aural perception. Each phrase was shaped with microscopic precision and feeling without compensating for an ounce of musical vibrance. Notes seemed printed in boldface, 125 percent more impactful. Wang conveyed this level of musical resolution through each segment of the movement, delivering a subtle entrance, a sprightly march, and a cadent development all with gusto.
If the concerto’s first movement demonstrated the intensity of Wang’s playing, the second movement — a lyrical Andante — showcased its nuance. Her handling of the introductory and secondary themes evoked a delicacy and intimacy that overcame the hall’s spaciousness. Each keystroke rang with a rare purity of intent, meaning, and feeling. Wang’s execution of the music’s warbling melodic lines, replete with tasteful rubato and complemented gracefully by left-hand arpeggiation, enlivened the hall. The pianist crystalized every passing moment into a transient jewel of artistic expression.
Finally, Wang’s rendition of the concerto’s concluding movement — a vivacious Allegro — embodied zest and playfulness. She rendered the second theme’s distinctive seven-eight meter with clarity, grace, and buoyancy. Each note seemed to defy gravity and levitate above the sound board. Wang’s performance of the concluding semi-quaver runs reflected a perfect mixture of power, precision, and enthusiasm. Yet nothing sounded overstressed or overthought. This combination of aural fidelity, artistic expression, and interpretive earnestness is what makes Yuja Wang’s playing a musical gift.
In comparison with Wang’s exceptional performance, the orchestra’s rendition of Haydn’s “Military” Symphony was lackluster. Nelsons’s interpretation of the symphony’s first movement, a classical Adagio-Allegro in sonata form, was heavy handed. The orchestra felt strained in its efforts to convey the lightness and elegance of Haydn’s music. Musical lines, so intricately conveyed by Wang’s touch, were rarely present in Nelsons’ interpretation of Haydn. This was not for a lack of trying; on multiple occasions, Nelsons’ gestures appeared to convey the shaping of a musical statement. No phrases, however, were heard. This was Haydn à la autopilot.
The second movement, an Allegretto, sounded especially labored. This was, thankfully, the closest Saturday’s performance came to a genuine drag on the ears. The following Menuetto Moderato provided some reprieve, with a clear three-four rhythm dictating the orchestra’s phrasing. Little discernible variation in phrasing, however, was conveyed to distinguish repetitions of the first theme. Finally, the fourth movement, a Presto in traditional sonata-rondo form, was vigorously played, but ultimately forgettable. The concert concluded with a routine curtain call to the tune of half-hearted clapping. The excitement and energy Wang Yuja so forcefully injected into the hall had all but died by the concert’s end. Stars, it seems, can only shine so brightly.

The Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s repertoire following the post-COVID return to campus has up to this point stuck to the Bard, with stagings of “Much Ado About Nothing,” “The Winter’s Tale,” and “King John.” This semester, the group is breaking with tradition by producing “Something Rotten,” a 2015 musical comedy written by John O'Farrell and Karey Kirkpatrick, with music by Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick. The Harvard adaptation premiers on Oct. 28 at 7:30 p.m. and runs through Nov. 5 on the Loeb Mainstage.
Set in London in 1595, “Something Rotten” follows the story of Nick and Nigel Bottom, two brothers and struggling playwrights in the shadow of their contemporary, Shakespeare, who with the help of Nostradamus hope to rise into fame by writing and staging a musical.
As director Samuel F. Dvorak ’23 says, Hyperion “almost always [stages] Shakespeare proper.” And so “Something Rotten” — a modern musical — marks a departure from what the group usually performs. But it is a change the group is not hesitant to make.
“We really appreciate Shakespeare and we love doing his works, but we're also not afraid to do something a bit more Shakespeare-adjacent,” said Taylor Kruse ’23
Hyperion’s stated mission is not just to perform Shakespeare at Harvard, but also to increase the presence of Shakespearean theater at Harvard outside of the academic realm. And staging a musical-homage to the Bard could go a long way towards that goal.
“It's hard to make Shakespeare accessible,” Dvorak said. “Hopefully people who have never read a Shakespeare play in their lives will see this show and can be excited to explore more.”
Crucially, though, the biggest change from the perspective of the production team might not be the show’s themes, but its scale. “[It] is a bit of a change of pace from like the smaller scale production of the usual Shakespeare plays,” Dvorak said. “I think this has been such an ambitious show and every element… is really big. It's the biggest show I've ever seen.”
Ambitious seems the right word to describe Hyperion’s production of “Something Rotten.” “It's very much a tribute to musical theater in the way that the show is written. And … that's very much incorporated into choreography and staging, said Caron S. Kim ’24, the show’s choreographer.
The show’s emphasis on music, choreography, and dance was not without its challenges, but, as Kim says, “everyone stepped up.” Tap dancing — which the show incorporates in three of its numbers — is a prime example. Despite the show’s relatively short, seven-week turnaround, all of its 21 cast members learned how to do it. “[They] were up for the challenge and succeeded with flying colors,” Kim said.
Indeed, the show seems to shine not in spite of, but because of its technical difficulty and sophistication. “This is perhaps the most technically amazing set that I've been a part of and I’m just floored by every single technical aspect of it,” Kruse said.
Another obstacle the team has overcome were the issues with the source material itself. The production team worked together to find readings and interpretations of certain problematic parts that would at the same time “feel true and are actually funny.”
“There are things that read differently now than [they] maybe read then, especially when you think of a show that was pushing the envelope of what was funny in 2015,” Dvorak said.
But in the end, the show’s humorous, somewhat sanctimonious book might be the production’s greatest strength.
“I've never laughed more watching a musical,” Dvorak said. “It's the most funny show out there. ‘Infectiously happy’ is a nice way to describe it.”
Importantly for the Harvard community, there is more to the show than just the laughs and silliness.
“I think it's a show about being true to yourself, about battling imposter syndrome, in addition to the hugely comedic aspects of it,” Dvorak said.

The Citizen Bank Opera House was brimming with audience members eagerly awaiting the opening night performance of “Hairspray” on Wednesday, Oct. 19. The musical, a part of Lexus 22/23 Broadway in Boston Season, returns to Boston with the show’s original director and choreographer, Jack O’Brien and Jerry Mitchell, respectively. Though the cast manages to wonderfully bring the show to life, the musical comedy, based on the 1988 film “Hairspray,” shows its age as its outdated plot is performed to a modern audience.
“Hairspray” takes place in 1960s Baltimore and follows the story of a young, overweight girl Tracy Turnblad (Niki Metcalf) whose dream is to become a dancer on the popular “Corny Collins Show.” Not only is dance Tracy’s passion, but she also is in love with the show’s heartthrob, Link Larkin (Nick Cortazzo). Initially turned away from the show because of her body type, Tracy does not give up in her attempt to get cast. Though she eventually succeeds, along the way, she learns about the racial bigotry of the segregated television show. With her mother, Edna Turnblad (Andrew Levitt), best friend Penny Pingleton (Emery Henderson), and new friends including Seaweed J. Stubbs (Charlie Bryant III) and Motormouth Maybelle (Sandie Lee), Tracy leads a protest against the “Corny Collins Show” so that Black dancers may dance alongside white ones.
In depicting the uphill battle to change the show, “Hairspray” means to capture the fatphobia and racism that ran rampant in Baltimore in the 1960s, though ultimately concluding that anything can be solved by following one’s dreams and speaking out for what is right.
Although the cast did well, all things considered, it was obvious from the performance that it was the show’s opening night. The technical parts of the show seemed uncoordinated: Microphone feedback could be heard throughout the night and spotlights were frequently on the wrong actor. While the sets were beautiful and lively, audience members could clearly observe them rocking back and forth, their lack of sturdiness breaking the immersion somewhat.
Be that as it may, incredible actors and singers managed to pull the audience back in. Henderson as Penny is particularly remarkable: Her perfectly awkward, uncoordinated movements throughout the show allow for an impeccable portrayal of the awkward Penny. More than once throughout the show, Henderson well-deservedly leaves the entire audience laughing. Andrew Levitt (or, famed Nina West from “RuPaul’s Drag Race”) was another highlight of the show, taking on the comedic, albeit meaningful, role of Edna remarkably well. The duet “You’re Timeless to Me,” performed by Levitt and Ralph Prentice Daniel, who plays Tracy’s father, Wilbur Turnblad, strikes the rare perfect balance between endearing and hilarious. Finally, Cortazzo performs beautifully as Link. The hollowness of Link’s head reverberates through the theater, though his smile is simultaneously stamped on every viewers’ heart, a clear indicator that Cortazzo manages his role well.
But no singer quite matches Sandie Lee in her portrayal of Motormouth Maybelle, a DJ, record shop owner, and mother, especially in the number “I Know Where I’ve Been.” Lee’s performance gives the audience goosebumps. Her solo almost makes the viewers turn to the person sitting next to them and agree that this is what makes coming to the theater worth it.
The impeccable performances by the actors can’t change the fact that the show was written in an era with different sensibilities. In faithfully adapting the source material, “Hairspray” can be quite offensive at times: Some of the lines feel outright racist. For example, in the musical number “Without Love,” Penny sings that after falling in love with Seaweed, a Black man, “[she’s] tasted chocolate / And [she’s] never going back.” In the same song, Seaweed references his life in the “ghetto,” pulling a switchblade out of his pocket as he does so. The main protagonist suffers from the opposite issue: While obviously well-intentioned, to a modern audience, she can come off as a white savior.
All things considered, Broadway in Boston did a phenomenal job assembling a strong cast and delivering a triumphant return of the show to Boston. But it leaves one question unanswered: At what point does a show need to be retired or re-written? The Boston community can decide after seeing the musical, which runs through Oct. 30.

In the past, the name Ezra Miller evoked the image of stardom, with their extensive filmography including films like “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” “Fantastic Beasts,” and an upcoming starring role in “The Flash.” In recent months, however, dark details regarding the actor’s life have brought into question their mental stability and the safety of those around them. Charges against Miller range from assault and felony burglary and the grooming and abuse of female and non-binary identifying minors to running a cult-like harem out of their ranch in Vermont. Despite calls to fire Miller from the upcoming Flash movie over these incidents, Warner Bros has yet to take any action.
Miller's descent into infamy began in March 2020, when they strangled two people in Reykjavik, Iceland. The first choking incident was dismissed as a drunken altercation, but the second choking incident, which was filmed and uploaded by a bystander, sparked outrage amongst fans of the Flash franchise.
That same spring, Miller also allegedly ran a cult from their Reykjavik Airbnb. Those who visited the actor’s home recall a commune-like environment and days filled with spiritual monologues and group meditations led by Miller’s spiritual advisor Jasper Young Bear. To Miller`s followers, he was a “Messiah” who “the Freemasons were sending demons out to kill and a spiritual leader.”
In an interview with Insider, a young woman who had a brief sexual relationship with Miller described the unhealthy environment within Miller’s “commune”: “Nobody ever was kind of allowed to disagree with them… Their reality painted everybody else’s reality. There was no room for anybody else’s opinion or feelings.”
Miller’s violent outbursts did not stop upon their return to the United States. This spring, they were arrested for disorderly conduct and second-degree assault in Hawaii.
In June, Chase Iron Eyes, father of Indigenous activist Tokata Iron Eyes, accused Miller of grooming Tokata from the age of 12 and manipulating the teen with various psychedelic drugs. According to Iron Eyes, Miller and Tokata began a sexual relationship when the activist was only 16. During their relationship, Miller exhibited concerning and ‘deranged behavior’, claiming that they were an incarnation of Jesus Christ and allegedly leaving bruises on Tokata’s body.
Not long after the allegations went public, the actor and activist went missing and were later found hiding at Miller's Vermont ranch. Tokata Iron Eyes continues to deny any wrongdoing by Miller.
Since then, Miller’s ranch has become a self-proclaimed “healing haven” where they are currently hosting a 25-year-old mother and her three children. According to two sources who spoke to Rolling Stone, the ranch is a dangerous environment, with guns, weapons, and drugs allegedly strewn across the property. One source even recalled an instance when a one-year-old child allegedly put a loose bullet in her mouth.
Descriptions of the ranch possess strong similarities to Miller’s Icelandic cult, containing “an altar that’s home to bullets, weed, sage, and Flash figurines” where women who enter must leave offerings along with their cell phones. The Vermont police have attempted to launch an investigation into the safety of the mother’s children, but have been unable to locate the family.
As the saga of Ezra Miller progresses, one just has to ask — what the hell happened? How did one of Hollywood’s biggest stars become its biggest liability over the course of mere months? Will Miller’s tale become one of healing and recovery, or a tragic story of how poor mental health and unrestrained power can lead to disaster or an indictment of a Hollywood sphere that leaves its stars unchecked. Only time will tell.

Powered by Ti West’s direction and Eliot Rockett’s cinematography, “Pearl” is a film that, though filled to the brim with stunning visuals, has a cliché story. “Pearl” is the second installation of a trilogy of films, the first of which, “X,” premiered earlier this year. With familiar plot, “X” follows a group of actors who set out to make an X-rated film in rural Texas under the noses of hermitic hosts, but when the old couple finds out, the group gradually gets picked off one by one. The origin story, “Pearl,” is a slasher horror that gives a character evaluation on “X”’s villains: They are driven by old age and dead dreams.
Here, Mia Goth is once again able to demonstrate her range as an actress. In “X,” Goth played two characters: the youthful main character, Maxine, and — hidden under layers of heavy makeup and prosthetics — the frightening, old Pearl. “Pearl” aims to give a backstory to this elderly woman.
Set in the year 1918, Pearl is trapped on her family’s isolated farm, tending to her ailing father (Matthew Sunderland), and under the constant, overbearing watch of her devout and fearful mother (Tandi Wright). Lusting for the life that she’s seen on the silver screen, Pearl finds herself eager to make a name for herself and escape her family’s suffocating home. Goth’s performance is as alluring as it is frightening. Most viewers will be able to see some version of themselves within her. Wanting what you cannot have, fighting for your dreams, and the strong desire to “be loved by as many people as possible ” are common — hopefully, you aren’t a maniacal killer, though.
Goth steals the show in every scene that she’s in, giving the murderous old lady in “X” a true gut-wrenching and sometimes sympathetic backstory for viewers. The most mind-blowing scene of all is her six-minute monologue at the end of the movie to her imaginary soldier husband. With tears rushing down her cheeks, she asks, “What is wrong with me? Please just tell me so maybe I could get better … I want to be dancing up on the screens like the pretty girls in the pictures.” Here, Goth commands the attention of every viewer and leaves the theater in stunned silence.
The movie, of course, is about Pearl and no one else. No matter how good any other actor was on screen, they were never playing a well written character — rather they were pawns to give Pearl the attention she deserves and, in some ways, what the character desires.
However, this could very well be ascribing meaning to why characters were never given a story to tell. “Pearl” was co-written in two weeks while West and Goth were “quarantining in hotel rooms before traveling to New Zealand to film ‘X.’” Seeing as the script was churned out in such a short period of time, it’s logical that characters would not be fully fleshed out, dialogue lulls, content is jumbled, and tension falls flat in long chunks of the movie. The low-quality writing makes the film a difficult watch for the first hour and gives it a rushed, unfinished quality.
With that said, the visuals are what define this movie. Reminiscent of grainy, classical Hollywood cinema of the early 20th century, “Pearl” is undeniably a beautiful watch. Cinematographer Eliot Rockett not only draws inspiration from the time that Pearl is based in, but he enhances the scenes by making colors more vibrant and captivating; ultimately alluring the audience with the dreamlike quality that we associate with technicolor. Cutting through these scenes is West’s failed attempt to link “Pearl” to “X.” He constantly recycles scenes from “X” which could be seen as a stylistic choice but is overall unnecessary. Their attempts to reference themselves are unrefined. Rather than being subtle, West force feeds the original content to the viewer.
“Pearl” does not stop at its ineffective connections: It also puts a twisted spin on “The Wizard of Oz.” The Projectionist (David Corenswet) that Pearl meets one late night after a movie screening represents the tin man, and like in the original “Wizard of Oz,” the Projectionist is proper, charming, and knowledgeable. He’s traveled the world, and he seems full of life and new opportunities, but with that there is something a little peculiar, hollow, and heartless about him. The movie’s version of the scarecrow archetype is, in fact, a literal scarecrow that Pearl stumbles upon on her ride home through a cornfield. She pulls him off his stand, dances with him — bringing him to life — and makes out with him.
The cowardly lion is represented by her incapacitated father, who looks on in silent fear as his daughter rampages — murdering her mother, the projectionist, and finally smothering him to death — but is never able to say a word. Pearl’s mother represents the Wicked Witch of the West, demonstrated in her overbearing, cruel, abusive, and strict personality. Pearl’s mother acts as a villain in the story, forcing Pearl to extinguish her passions.
Through these various characters, “Pearl” is able to successfully put a gory spin on a familiar, lovable story. With horrifying undertones, the main theme still rings true from the original “Wizard of Oz:” To never stop dreaming.
To call “Pearl” a slasher film would be misleading. This is a deconstruction of “X”’s killer, who was never given any motive for murdering young people on her farm. After watching “Pearl,” it’s clear that “X” is a movie about suppressed desires and longing. If it was not for the weak references to “X” and the cliché, poor quality of the film’s writing, this could have been a fantastic standalone character study intertwined with light horror elements.

Dark messaging, childhood trauma, and shocking violence coalesce in “Luckiest Girl Alive.” The Netflix film is based on Jessica Knoll’s 2015 New York Times bestselling book of the same name. However, due to its darker themes, the film has also found itself mired in controversy, with viewers urging Netflix to add a trigger warning to the beginning of the film.
“Luckiest Girl Alive” follows New York writer Ani FaNelli (Mila Kunis), who is asked to take part in a true-crime documentary about the school shooting that occured at her high school. While the movie presents itself as a seemingly light story about a writer in New York planning for her wedding, “Luckiest Girl Alive” progressively adopts a darker tone in its dialogue, as well as in its graphic scenes of violence. As a film, “‘Luckiest Girl Alive” succeeds in delivering a strong message that involves complex themes. However, it is in the film’s core scenes of violence and trauma that it fails to reach its potential.
Kunis shone throughout this film, delivering lines effectively and performing heavier scenes with a commendable skill. Ani FaNelli requires compelling portrayal because she is in recovery from multiple traumatic events, and Kunis steps up to the task. She surprises in both light-hearted and particularly tense scenes with the way she is able to embody the weight of her character’s past as the film progresses. About half of Kunis’s scenes depict her engaging in pre-wedding activities believably and naturally and add a brilliant contrast to her tense form and pained expressions when she speaks about Ani’s teenage years. The sharp dissonance in these states of being highlights her ability to seamlessly shift from a writer to a survivor.
Chiara Aurelia, who plays the teenage Ani FaNelli, similarly impresses in her portrayal of the horrific events that occurred during Ani’s high school years. Despite having to depict horrific displays of repeated sexual assault, Aurelia effectively conveys Ani’s complex emotions and behaviors in many hard-to-watch scenes. In addition, the dialogue of the film is well-written and effective in conveying both the daily conversations of the characters and scenes of tragedy.
Despite compelling performances, “Luckiest Girl Alive” falls short in a familiar way: in its use of flashbacks to reveal past events. The plot of the film is based on the tragedies that Ani encountered, however, it is unclear to the reader until the later half of the film how Ani and her classmates were truly involved in this horrific event. While it leaves watchers in the dark for a majority of the film, this strategy initially works well for the film. It depicts the heavy toll the event still had on Ani’s daily life and the long term effects that still reverberated in her life, rather than simply recounting her past. However, this leads to ultimately confusing introductions of characters and relationships.
As a result, “Luckiest Girl Alive” disappoints in the most pivotal moments of Ani’s life. While the film’s brevity during these teenage scenes can be beneficial in avoiding repetitiveness, these parts of the film are confusing due to a lack of introduction or context for new characters and the connections between the main character and surrounding characters being made only after these scenes have already passed. Furthermore, it would have been more effective to display more context of Ani’s home life and relationships with her social circle and mother, in order to better lay out the story to viewers. In speaking about her own reasons for writing the book, Knoll said the book was based on her own experiences in high school:
"There were these dueling things inside of me. I desperately craved the release of getting my story out on paper, and the validation of recognizing what had happened to me as rape. I needed that,” Knoll said.
Knoll’s experiences help shine a light on the main messaging of the film. Despite confusing scenes and relationships, the film effectively conveys powerful messaging about trauma and the label of “a victim.” Whether it be Kunis and Aurelia’s performances or a love for Knoll’s book, “Luckiest Girl Alive” is a film with important takeaways that should not be overlooked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spoilers for “Halloween Ends” follow. 
About three-quarters of the way through the slasher flick “Halloween Ends,” Willy the Kid (Keraun Harris), the D.J. of Haddonfield, Ill.’s radio station, receives a stern call from a listener who objects to the way he has been exploiting Haddonfield’s special long-running tragedy for entertainment. “Beware, sir,” she admonishes, “that when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster, for when you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.”
Little does the caller realize that she is dealing with a fellow person of letters, equipped with a slightly less ubiquitous quote from old Friedrich. Willy replies: “Nietzsche also said, ‘Without music, life would be a mistake,’ ” and to demonstrate puts on The Cramps’ “I Was a Teenage Werewolf.”
So goes “Halloween Ends”’s approach to philosophy, which is to spout vaguely thoughtful-sounding platitudes in the hopes that the resultant scramble might take on a blurry cast of thematic resonance. Such faux-philosophy provides one of the film’s two major driving forces. How much better is the other, which finds expression less than a minute later when poor Willy finds his head bashed six times into WURG’s dual turntable and his tongue severed with a pair of steel scissors! (Sensitive viewers be warned: The camera spares us nothing.)
“Halloween Kills,” the predecessor to “Halloween Ends,” was a delightful parade of no-holds-barred silliness (the title of this video is appropriate but, perhaps, not quite wide enough in its scope) that followed its own absurdity to the (il)logical point of implying that “Halloween” franchise masked baddie Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney) might actually have superpowers.
“Ends” has some moments that live up to “Kills”’s reverie — as when new baddie Corey (Rohan Campbell) drives a truck into a chain-link fence which his adolescent prey is in the process of descending, knocking the fence to the floor and flattening her with it — but for the most part it is a regretfully somber affair. Not that there is anything wrong with somberness, but “Ends” is the filmic analogue of a college student who is only amusing after two or three shots of liquor and is otherwise not only unamusing but barely tolerable. The “Halloween” films’ liquor is gore — stupid, stupid gore — and “Ends” is in bad need of more of it.
The trouble begins — the movie begins — with Corey, who in 2019 is caught in the unfortunate position of appearing to have murdered his babysitting charge. He is innocent, and cleared in court, but fast forward to 2022 and Haddonfield has made him a pariah. Yet Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), who as Michael’s primary target going on 44 years is the recipient of much venom from most Haddonfieldians notices his suffering and reaches out. (“Kills” enthusiasts will recognize that film’s stab at commentary on the cruelty of crowds carrying over into the sequel.)
Then Corey finds Michael Myers living in a sewer and becomes his apprentice.
Why does he do this? At one point it is suggested (over a pool table — the single best conduit to thought, as whoever outfitted Harvard’s residential houses knew well) that Corey has been turned into a (metaphorical) monster by the Haddonfieldians’ ostracization. But Corey shows no sign of any such Shelleyan monstrosity when we first jump forward to 2022, and at several key junctures Corey mounts the insistence that if he can’t have Laurie’s granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) then no one will, so we are left with a jumble of motives, and no ambiguity of the sort that causes one to smile and furrow one’s brow.
Adding to the thematic jambalaya is Michael himself. Laurie calls him the embodiment of “pure evil” more than once, but he also seems to represent trauma, and then at the end of the film he also also becomes the Nazarene, as Laurie pins him to a table by putting knives through both his hands and initiates a reenactment of the Crucifixion, complete with a miniature Holy Lance. Christ on the Cross is a powerful symbol, but not when it is made to be ridiculous. A single character cannot bear the symbolic burden of standing for evil, trauma, and the King of the Jews all at once, and Michael Myers collapses under it. Are we to learn from the film’s finale that the best thing to do about one’s trauma is to grind it in an industrial shredder?
Despite all this, it bears mentioning that Curtis is fantastic, as when she advises Allyson, “You need to find someone that … makes you want to rip off your shirt and show grief your fucking tits and say, ‘You know what? Let’s go!’ ” At this point the “Halloween” franchise is hers more than it is anyone else’s — including the pretender Christ — and these movies seem to be a real passion project for her. If this is more than a line she feeds to the press, then it alone justifies their existence.
The fact that a bad movie’s existence is justified, however, does not stop it from being a bad movie. And make no mistake: That is what “Halloween Ends” is. It is not a “good bad movie”; it is too ponderous for that. One should be skeptical of those who would build a wall between entertainment and artistic merit; but for most of its runtime, “Halloween Ends” has neither.

It’s a Thursday night, a bit past midnight. For the first time ever, I’m at a listening party. I’m in good company, as we sit in a circle, with friends new and old, all Swifties, united for “Midnights,” despite the midterm mayhem. I subtly lean over to read every song's lyrics, absorb its stories, and weave them into my world. The melodies overlay memories I’m reliving, summer crushes, shattered dreams, forevers that last two years, nevers that last two seconds. Here, nestled in Leverett’s G-Hutch, hidden under the stars, I’ve never been more sure that I’m exactly where I need to be, a feeling that’s always been my golden snitch.
This year has been messy. I’ve lost confidantes, found allies, disappeared, reincarnated, broken, and healed. For all the wax poetic I do, more often than not, I feel like I’m doing it all wrong. I watch as the world marches onwards, as the people around me, floating and jiving, form a perfect scene without me. I belong somewhere, but not there.
Long before “Anti-Hero,” the Taylor Swift song, existed, I’ve felt like I’m an antihero. It’s that I’m not heroic, exactly. Rather, I’m not conventional. I’ve never been conventional. I oscillate between the effervescent Anuksha, charismatic and charming, sweetly optimistic, bouncing with a hint of god complex, and the antihero Anuksha, self-identifying as crazy and dramatic, before someone else can say it to me, as they do, sitting in the dark for hours to escape the overstimulation, hypercritically analyzing and reviewing actions and behaviors, worried I’m a bad person. I’m a lot, easy to like, hard to love.
My whole life I’ve felt misunderstood, outside of very select spaces where people proved me wrong, grabbed my hand, had my back, proved to me that they were ready to root for an antihero, camped out even after I’d reminded them they don’t have to do this. They’re why I’m here. Aside from them, everyone’s always had their own story to tell about me, where “antihero” would have been, frankly, generous based on how I was treated. I figured why I didn’t and would never fit in was straightforward: high school in Florida, where racism, sexism, ableism, and homophobia never cease. At Harvard, I thought I’d find my people, once and for all catch the snitch and never let go, no longer searching for belonging. And yet, three years in, I still feel more like a villain than a hero. I’m texting my best friend, “maybe i’m entering my villain era idk,” with her trying to negotiate that I’m at least an antihero or a vigilante. Reframe my self-loathing tendencies with a little Thesaurus.com.
Charlie King ’24, who was unaware that they were autistic, grew up believing that “there was something inherently evil and wrong” with them. They once felt that their experience of resonating with the psychopathy label because they “connect with empathy differently,” was niche, though they’ve since heard from others that it’s more common than they once thought.
“No matter how hard I tried, I was always the bad guy,” King says.
Within the neurodiversity umbrella, a number of its conditions are described as an all-encompassing experience. For me, my ADHD is fundamentally intertwined with my being, my perception, my identity. Especially, and often with “co-morbidities that color that [experience] even more,” as King notes, there’s no easy or concise way to neatly describe any singular neurodivergent reality, no matter how hard the DSM 5 tries. For King, they wish that people understood, neurodiversity “is a lens that applies to everything, and you really cannot separate it from every single thing that you do.”
“There is nothing I can do wherein I am a person without autism,” King states.
To a certain extent, speaking for myself, to resent my ADHD is to resent myself.
In its diagnosis, neurodiversity is at best described reductively, typically within a framework that implicitly demands the individual smooth and shapeshift themselves into the scene, become painted on a canvas of unwritten principles.
For example, as King explains, even ADHD itself is a misnomer, because though “the symptom that was most seen in the diagnostic pool was sort of an inability to concentrate” by researchers and observers, that symptom barely scratches the surface.  In reality, the disorder is infinitely more than the singular symptom of attention issues. It’s a fundamentally different neurotype, with great minds from Da Vinci and Einstein suspected to have had it, along with autism. We praise them for their work, their history, their legacy, their creativity, their neurodiversity; meanwhile, we ostracize neurodiversity when we hear its terminology or recognize its unfamiliarity.
“It is our duty in our broader equity work to understand the impact of neurodiversity, its relevant intersectionalities, to create a more just world,” King states.
Mainstream understanding simply doesn’t center neurodivergent individuals for themselves. Instead, it feeds into the villain narrative, of how specific symptoms burden others. What are villains if not those fighting against the world?
“The validation by other autistic people that we can't navigate the world is what has quite literally saved many of us, myself included.” King tells me. “the world is not prepared to take an equitable lens to neurodivergence and disability justice point blank.” If nothing else, “understanding that other people are also on the same side of feeling misunderstood, feeling isolated is validating.”
Even as dialogue surrounding mental well being rises, it still feels surface level.
In my experience, it feels as though most people empathize insofar as I’m not a burden to them, which isn’t hard, nor is it real empathy. When I slip up, when the antihero is all I can be, and I acutely feel the discomfort. When relatability morphs into pity, my worthiness is withdrawn.
It’s hard to be the bad guy, especially when you never truly ever were the bad guy. It’s “a really hard way to grow up because not only do you have such negative input from other people, but you have negative self input,” as King relays.
So now, as a junior in college, I still bounce from space to space, finding pockets where I’m not an anti-hero, just me, in listening parties with my fellow disabled Swifties and company, conversations with a six-year-old swinging on Mather gate, lo-fi iPhone karaoke on long walks back to campus after late-night lab socials.
I’m not scared anymore of people giving up on me, walking out on me, or even simply forgetting me. But, I don’t want little kids growing up to think they’re an antihero or a villain, when in reality, it’s the world that turned its back on them. I’ll still be a seeker, and when I catch the snitch, I’ll remember I’m worthy, of like and of love, of community and camaraderie, of advocacy, of justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to the Supreme Court, a 32-foot tall Latin cross on public land maintained with public money does not violate the Establishment Clause.
The monument to American veterans of World War I looms over Bladensburg, Maryland, and it had been looming over the town for roughly 90 years when the American Humanist Association charged that maintaining such an explicitly religious symbol was unconstitutional. It should come as no surprise to readers of this column, or watchers of the current Court in general, that the 7-2 majority in American Legion v. American Humanist Association ruled funding the monument was acceptable because of its “historical significance.”
Especially on matters of religion, the current Court’s interpretation of the Establishment Clause — that it does not apply to publicly-funded expressions of Christianity because they are more “historical” than religious — is nothing new. Fourteen years prior, a different Court handed down a similar decision in Van Orden v. Perry, ruling 5-4 that a monument to the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol was also constitutional because of their “undeniable historical meaning.”
Reading the texts of these cases makes it painfully clear what perspective the majority justices are approaching the decision from: that government-supported Christianity is not an establishment of religion because Christianity is itself synonymous with America. As a secular American, this is a perspective I cannot reconcile with my identity. The Ten Commandments are not simply “consistent with a religious doctrine,” as the Court claimed in Van Orden; they are the religious doctrine. I do not believe there can ever be a “passive monument” that elevates one religion above others; that to me is an inherently active claim asserting the veracity and legitimacy of one religion at the expense of those who do not follow it.
These legal decisions are not drivers of public opinion. Rather, they are the logical legal extremes of a culture which views Christianity as the backdrop against which all other worldviews are compared.
To illustrate this explicitly, I want to take this story a bit closer to home.
When Greg Epstein, Harvard’s humanist chaplain, was unanimously elected president of the Harvard Chaplains, the backlash was swift and unflinching. One commentator argued that the loss of theological purpose meant Harvard had an “absence of justification,” no reason to exist if not to bring humans closer to God. Another criticized the “complete and abject surrender” of Epstein’s religious colleagues in selecting him. And as another so eloquently put it, electing Epstein “only heaps further scorn on Harvard’s wokeness.”
This collection of jeremiads about the state of the university often had one common theme — how Harvard has fallen into secularism from its religious founding. A favorite talking point was that the current University motto, “Veritas” followed “Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae,” or  “Truth for Christ and Church.”
In my mind, that secularization those commentators derided was something to celebrate. If “Veritas” is our mission, then it is a mission anyone may take part in, from the most devout Christian seeking “Truth for Christ and Church” to the most strident atheist seeking truth solely for the betterment of humanity. And that vision is quickly becoming a reality; in my class, the Class of 2025, the largest religious identity is “agnostic,” and the second is “atheist,” together constituting 41.3 percent of current sophomores.
But as an atheist student, it can often seem like that Christian grounding for that mission has never really left. As a first-year living in Weld Hall, I would pass Memorial Church on every walk to Annenberg, often hearing the bells chiming out in all their sectarian glory. The names of University and College administrators can often be found on the lists of speakers for morning prayers placed outside the Church every week. While Christians have the opportunity to hear a multi-denominational Protestant worship every morning, markedly less resplendent prayer spaces for Muslim and Hindu students sit just a few steps away in the basement of Canaday Hall.
This is not to say that Memorial Church is a negative presence on campus; on the contrary, I have only had positive experiences with the institution, including with humanist and interfaith groups who have been welcomed into their spaces.
But there are clear differences between who gets to welcome others into a space, and who has to be welcomed in. Between who gets a glamorous house of worship and who gets a basement. Between who has a space for themselves, and who has to set aside their religious trauma and negative associations with religion and reclaim a space just to make it a spiritual home.
Whether dominated by a giant cross in Bladensburg or a monument in Austin or a church in Cambridge, the burden of physical privilege almost always falls with Christianity. This is only natural; we cannot help but inherit a predominantly Christian physical landscape from our forebears. But living in a pluralistic society means actively meeting each religious group on their own terms. If we do not meaningfully interrogate how our spaces have historically privileged one religious tradition, then we open the door to more decisions like Van Orden and American Legion which claim that America is synonymous with that one religion.
Harvard is no longer a Christian institution. But being a pluralistic institution means doing more than just dropping “Christo et Ecclesiae” from the motto, and being a pluralistic country means doing more than using “historical significance” as a legal justification. Only once we acknowledge who our physical society privileges, and who it excludes, can non-Christians truly be equal participants in our national identity.

How many more corpses do I have to transport to the morgue?
Consider this hypothetical scenario:
1 a.m.: The operating room nurses take the bed out of the room, wheel it to the staff elevators, come up to our fifth-floor ICU, and park outside room 52. On the bed is a man no older than I, lying there, completely still. The patient is sedated and ventilated, with no less than eight different tubes maintaining bodily functions for him.
1:15 a.m.: I finish receiving report. A car accident on the highway threw this man into a windshield, where he hit his head and developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, or bleeding in the brain. The surgeon evacuated any existing blood and placed a drain in the brain ventricle to prevent an increase in brain pressure. Prognosis: Dismal without a month of continued care.
1:45 a.m.: His parents call the hospital and ask about him. I field the call. Fighting through tears, his mother asks what has happened to her baby boy, if he’s going to be okay. The only thing I can tell her is that they can come to the hospital.
2:15 a.m.: The parents, no older than my own, arrive. His mother is a blubbering mess, makeup running, hair disheveled, barely understandable through the veil of grief. What breaks me is his father. A single arm around his wife and a blank stare. A single tear tracks down his vacant face. When that levee breaks…
2:30 a.m.: I spend two hours talking to his parents. I offer them treatment plans, support, assurance, and faith. In exchange, they gift me memories. Photos of their smiles, moments with him, his accomplishments, his dreams. I can’t reconcile these memories, these images with the person lying on the bed.
4:40 a.m.: The bill updates. One surgery: $90,000. One night of post-surgical critical care: $10,000. The doctor comes in and explains that, for care, another surgery may have to be done, requiring their son to stay in the hospital for at least another three weeks. The color drains from the mother’s face. A silent whisper betrays her: “We can’t afford that. We don’t have insurance.” She immediately claps her hand over her mouth.
7 a.m.: Time for day shift to come in. I pack up my belongings and swipe out. I will decide which road to take home. His parents will decide when to let their son die.
6:45 p.m.: I am back at the hospital. I am greeted with a purple monitor: comfort care. They cannot afford to treat their son, so they must let him pass. The impossible choice has been made. Without saying a word, I walk into the room, sit down on the couch, and hold their hands. I will be there as long as I need.
7:15 p.m.: He’s dead.
While working as a care partner at my local hospital, I watched people with worse situations stand up and walk out with their family and multiple “get well soon” balloons in tow. They could pay; this man could not.
While this exact story may be hypothetical, albeit inspired by one of my own experiences, similar stories of people dying due to a lack of health insurance are true for thousands of families around the United States every year. It is far past time to dispose of the payment obstacle. The impetus is on Harvard and other such powerful institutions to use their voices to do good, enact change, and save people’s lives.
Many people who read this will agree with me wholeheartedly, but this story is not for them. This story is for those who fall prey to the maelstrom of misinformation, misconstruction, and misjudgment surrounding the system of single-payer healthcare under which all essential healthcare costs are covered by a single governmental source.
This is for those like the Harvard administration, which automatically enrolls every student in the Blue Cross Blue Shield sponsored Health Insurance plan and discourages enrollment in the state-sponsored Massachusetts Health Connector — established for those who have recently lost health insurance. This is for those, like the Harvard administration, who continue and propagate the current inaccessible system of private healthcare that has contributed to the death of more than 162,000 people in seven years.
There are many arguments I could make in support of single-payer healthcare. No, it’s not more expensive; some researchers have found it to save a net $2 trillion in a ten-year period. No, you won’t have to wait much longer for care. But all these arguments have been made by people more educated, powerful, and respected.
To all those who dispute a single-payer health system on the grounds that it is uneconomical, or inefficient: Your arguments have been refuted time and time again, by scholars and experts more knowledgeable than us both.
I can only say one additional thing to try to change your mind.
I will have to put this man’s cold, stiff, bare dead body in a body bag and take him to the morgue. You will not.

What if a major highway cut through Cambridge?
That was the proposal residents faced 50 years ago when Massachusetts highway officials announced the Cambridge Inner Belt. The eight-lane expressway would destroy 2,200 housing units and displace 13,000 people. But through protest and activism, they fought back against the plan. Finally, in 1971, Governor Francis Sargent rejected the Inner Belt, defying powerful lobbies. Without losing a single home, Cambridge residents beat the highway.
This story is not unique to Cambridge. For over a century, people and cars have been at odds. As the Interstate Highway System was being constructed in the 1950s, urban communities began opposing the network. These protests, called “highway revolts,” took on planned interstates in New York City, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. Some highway revolts, like here in Cambridge, were successful; others, like in Los Angeles, failed, with devastating effects.
Since then, a dissonance grew between the powerful resistance to highway projects and the views that developed once drivers were on them.
Over the rest of the century, car ownership began symbolizing freedom in America. Today, plastered across screens, magazines, and billboards, car manufacturers entice us to invest in a personal vehicle — for choice, convenience, and even conservation. Parts of our media ecosystem defend cars when needed. The automobile, oil, and gas industries contribute millions of dollars to elected officials. All of this work bolsters one of the most profitable industries in the country.
Generations of Americans later, driving has meant total liberation, a passport to the open road.
But for our quality of life and the sustainability of our planet, we must change.
Almost every region in the United States suffers from an overreliance on cars at the expense of other forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. This concept, called “car dependency,” has strangled our cities. Once you notice it, it is impossible to ignore.
Planners develop housing around cars by enforcing single-family zoning. Officials prioritize car-centric infrastructure like parking lots, fast speed limits, and wide roads. To get anywhere within many American cities, you need a car. The lack of alternatives locks everyone into the system — a far cry from liberation.
Car dependency carries disastrous social consequences, from socioeconomic inequality associated to fatalities to poorer health outcomes. Transportation remains the largest polluter in the Commonwealth, worsening air quality while contributing directly to climate change.
The economic consequences are not much better. Massachusetts subsidizes its cars, trucks, roads, and parking areas considerably. The cost of this vehicle economy? Roughly $64 billion a year, over half of which is borne by the public. That is $14,000 per Massachusetts family. We all pay substantially towards the vehicle economy, whether we own a car or not.
All of this precedes the carnage that plays out on our roads every day. In 2021, there were 42,915 traffic fatalities nationwide — including more than 400 in Massachusetts.
The evidence is clear. People are worse off when they cannot choose how they want to travel.
Despite the evidence, the gears of American infrastructure enforce upon its people a system of government that ensures automobile supremacy — a system I call motocracy.
Motocracy is the culmination of oil-fueled capitalism.
The oil and gas industries successfully transitioned the United States from transit to private automobiles. Today the industries contribute over $90 million to Congress, and policymakers respond in kind. Under motocracy, the government depends on the auto industry for state revenue and job growth; our leaders thus  respond quickly to industry requests.
As a result, our legal system protects and enforces motocracy. In Greater Boston, single-family zoning and other land-use restrictions make apartments illegal in 80 percent of available land. The system also requires parking space and highway construction, stretching resources across greater distances of lower density.
Under motocracy, the law tacitly blames pedestrians for their own deaths, refusing to hold drivers accountable. Jaywalking — an invented and at times racially-biased crime — remains technically illegal in most of the United States, including Massachusetts. There are lower expectations for how safe a driver must be on the road, and criminal charges are rare even when a driver kills someone.
The imbalance between cars and people creates inherent unfairness in our justice system. In Massachusetts, motocracy reinforces decades of residential segregation, displacement, and environmental racism.
Resource collapse, dark money, judicial corruption, racism, and death. These are the effects of car dependency. As it stands, motocracy runs antithetical to democratic ideals in America. It must be dismantled.
To this statement, many motorists might insist they have the right to drive. I ask, what about the right not to have to drive?
The rise of the automobile required the destruction of tens of thousands of homes. It unjustifiably and systemically removed wealth from communities of color. And it irreversibly damaged our climate.
Fifty years ago, communities across the country recognized the dangers of motocracy. Some chose to revolt. But many did not.
For our country to preserve justice and equality under the law, it must decouple itself from its overreliance on cars. Our regions must invest in fairer, more equitable modes of transportation and guarantee mobility. Car dependency cannot be our future, and it doesn’t have to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In October 2018, Sebastian Gomez, then a Harvard Ph.D. student, observed a black hole tear apart and engulf a small star in a galaxy located 665 million light years away from Earth. Almost three years later, he and a team of researchers noticed that the same black hole had begun ejecting stellar material.
Though scientists had previously observed black holes expelling cosmic debris immediately after tearing stars apart, researchers affiliated with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics noticed that the black hole — which had absorbed a star in 2018 — began ejecting stellar remnants in June 2021, much later than initially thought possible.
The team’s study, published two weeks ago in The Astrophysical Journal, explored the new phenomenon of delayed outflow of material emanating from a black hole as the result of what is known as a tidal disruption event, where a star strays too close to a black hole, whose tidal forces rip it into pieces.
The TDE described in the study, which the researchers have named AT2018hyz, was of interest to astronomers due to its peculiarly delayed “burping” behavior, according to Harvard Professor of Astronomy and study co-author Edo Berger.
“While this material is slowly draining, it is also possible that some of it will be blown off, and this is what we have seen in tidal disruption events so far,” Berger wrote in an email.
“However, in AT2018hyz, the material is being blown off (or burped) almost three years later, and that's the mystery,” he added. “We usually detect radio waves (which are a sign of material being blown off) right when a tidal disruption event occurs.”
Yvette N. Cendes, a research associate at the CfA and the study’s lead author, said she was also surprised at the long period before the emission.
“Nobody expected that that could happen in theory or really considered it,” Cendes said. “It's an awkward length of time.”
The unusual delay opens up new avenues of exploration in both experimental and theoretical research, revealing “a new dimension of our understanding of physics,” according to Cendes, who said the study’s recent developments have been “pretty exciting.”
“It’s the first time you realize, ‘Oh, this is something crazy that hasn't been seen before,’” she said. “It’s a pretty exciting moment, you know — the fact that you know this and nobody else really knows this on the planet.”
Berger added that the incident will likely compel astronomers to revisit some “basic assumptions” about TDEs, which he described as “the fun part” of astrophysics.
“We tried something new and unorthodox (looking at TDEs with radio waves years after the disruption) and made a new and unexpected discovery about the behavior of black holes that will now require detailed new models and computer simulations,” he wrote.
Cendes said researchers hope to expand on their investigation into the frequency of delayed burping behavior across other TDEs. She added that her team is still actively tracking the black hole's behavior as the light from the TDE continues to intensify.
“I can tell you that it's still getting brighter,” she said of the emission from the black hole. “Our last observation was last month, so it's going to be in our lives for a bit, and I'll definitely let everybody know what AT2018hyz is up to when the time is right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers rallied outside Smith Campus Center Thursday in protest of what they allege are “anti-union tactics” by the University.
More than 30 people — including Harvard students and other local union members — attended the rally. In a Thursday press release, HUCTW representatives advocated for a “fair” contract and alleged the University retaliated against two union members.
Union leaders allege the University wrongfully terminated Kevin Harrington after he contracted long Covid-19 and demoted Karen O’Brien, cutting her pay by 10 percent, in retaliation for her work as a union representative.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the allegations of retaliation.
In a July interview, O’Brien told The Crimson the University retaliated against her after she advocated for improved workplace health and safety.
HUCTW representative Geoff Carens said in the July interview that O’Brien was “scolded by her boss in front of her co-workers” for working as a union representative. The University then allegedly “reneged on the promise to make her senior functional coordinator” and demoted her, according to Carens.
“It’s very clear retaliation for union activity, which is unlawful,” they said.
In an emailed statement, Harrington alleged he experienced discrimination from the University while sick with long Covid-19.
“I feel like I was targeted, singled out for my union activity and experienced even greater discrimination, retaliation, and harassment when I got sick and succumbed to long COVID,” Harrington wrote. “I think what it comes down to is that NO ONE should be fired or laid off for getting sick, and Harvard needs to do better [to] ensure this.”
Newton, the University spokesperson, declined to comment on Harrington’s allegations.
After HUCTW’s contract with the University expired on Sept. 30, the two parties agreed to extend the existing contract until a new deal could be brokered. Nearly a month later, the union and University have yet to reach an agreement on fair wage raises.
At Thursday’s rally, Carens, the union representative, called on the University to offer higher wages.
“A big sticking point is wages,” Carens said of the contract negotiations. “For myself, I demand wages that well exceed inflation.”
Newton wrote in an email that the University is “committed” to reaching a deal with HUCTW. To achieve that end, both sides have agreed to bring in a mediator, Newton added.
“We are committed to reaching an agreement with our valued members of HUCTW and have made significant progress on several key issues since negotiations began in May,” he wrote.
“To help us finalize the outstanding aspects of a deal, both HUCTW and the University have decided to bring in a mediator, mutually agreed to by the parties, who we believe will be an important factor in helping to resolve our remaining differences and reach a final contract that both sides can agree upon,” Newton continued.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Journalist David R. Ignatius ’72 said the United States “must fix its broken political system” in order to remain a global leader at a forum hosted Monday by the Harvard Institute of Politics.
The forum, which was co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership, was moderated by former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78. The pair discussed threats to American democracy and their effect on the world order.
“If we can’t get our act together to make decisions and keep the country solid and cohesive, no way we’re going to be able to compete with the Chinese,” said Ignatius, a Washington Post columnist and novelist.
Ignatius discussed the behavior of world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“Orderly life among nations, as among people, depends on living up to expected behavior and there being sanctions that are quick and certain if you violate that,” Ignatius said. “Those norms are being ignored.”
Ignatius said previous foreign policy norms are being replaced by “gangsterism” — behavior that differs from typical leadership of the past.
“Often, President Biden will say, ‘What we’re fighting for is the rules-based order.’ And, it does sound empty, but I do think that we’re entering a world where a kind of ‘gangsterism’ is taking over,” Ignatius said.
Ignatius criticized Putin for his threats to use nuclear weapons in Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.
“What surprised me most has been the recklessness and brutality of President Putin,” Ignatius said. “[The war in Ukraine] was an unprovoked assault in violation of any kind of legality, and Putin is now, in effect, exerting nuclear blackmail.”
Patrick asked Ignatius about unrest in Iran over the government’s strict limits on behavior and social freedoms.
“People in private will tell you, passionately, how much they want ‘normal’ life,” he said. “This regime is way past its prime, people are sick of it, and I hope the people protesting it can get stronger and strong enough to make change.”
American leaders should be careful about “lecturing” other countries on the importance of democracy at a time when “we don’t give much of an example of how democratic systems should work,” Ignatius said.
“You cannot force political change at the point of a gun,” Ignatius said. “That’s what the United States should look for more in the world: supportive people whose interests align with ours and who want our help.”
“There’s no enemy or adversary that the United States has that’s as dangerous as our own political breakdown,” he added. “Nothing is going to harm us as much as that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard student organizations hosted a Monday discussion on divestment and youth activism with Black Lives Matter organizer Marcus McDonald and Palestinian writer Mohammed El-Kurd — who drew protest from some pro-Israel students who criticized his rhetoric as antisemitic.
More than 170 Harvard affiliates attended the talk, entitled “Confronting State Violence,” which was co-hosted by student groups including the Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign. As attendees entered Emerson Hall for the event, more than 30 protesters displayed Israel’s flag and waved posters criticizing El-Kurd.
Shortly after the event began, the protesters entered the lecture hall and held signs in the back of the room.
During Monday’s talk, El-Kurd described his experience with “violence that is systematically, institutionally sponsored.” El-Kurd grew up in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
“In our rage to seeing policemen and soldiers raid our homes, we have been called all kinds of things, and we have been accused of all kinds of bigotries,” he said. “But that goes to show you that those who dare resist colonial violence, those who dare resist state violence will be met with disinformation, will be met with protests, will be met with baseless accusations.”
El-Kurd, a 24-year-old activist and outspoken critic of Israel’s occupation of Palestine, has drawn criticism from pro-Israel organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and campus groups like Harvard Hillel and the Harvard Israel Initiative for rhetoric they deem antisemitic.
At Monday’s event, El-Kurd criticized the media’s depiction of Palestinian activists, saying they are labeled in the “binary of tropes of either a terrorist or a victim.”
McDonald discussed his activism against racism and white supremacy as the lead organizer of the Charleston Black Lives Matter chapter.
“Specifically state-sanctioned violence is something we’ve seen since we got here,” McDonald said. “If you look at the history, you can see that it’s rooted in white supremacy, it’s rooted in race-based violence.”
Harvard Hillel president Natalie L. Kahn ’23, who helped to organize the protest of the event, said while she believes “dialogue is very important,” El-Kurd’s rhetoric has “crossed the line.”
“The kind of ideology that the PSC is espousing, when that’s the kind of speaker that they’re inviting in — they can’t claim to be for peace and dialogue or for really any kind of conflict resolution,” said Kahn, a Crimson News editor.
Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, executive director of Harvard Hillel, wrote an email to Hillel members Monday morning denouncing El-Kurd’s invitation to speak on campus.
In response to criticisms of the event and speaker, PSC organizer Joshua D. Willcox ’23-’24 said PSC “condemns all forms of discrimination, antisemitism included.”
Protester Shira Z. Hoffer ’25 said while she feels El-Kurd’s “rhetoric often slips from anti-Israel, anti-Zionist sentiment into antisemitism,” she supports his invitation to campus as a means to strengthen academic discourse.
Still, Ph.D. student J.J. Kimche, who also protested, said he had hoped the event would be “blocked” by the administration.
A Harvard College spokesperson wrote that “freedom of expression is essential to a liberal arts and sciences education” in a statement to The Crimson following the protest.
During the event, El-Kurd advised young activists to “remember that liberation requires sacrifices,” citing the backlash he has received.
“People protesting my advocacy, people smearing my name, spreading disinformation about me, could not move a hair on my body,” El-Kurd said during the event. “It’s not because I’m strong, and it’s not because I’m powerful, but because when you put it in perspective, what’s a bunch of whiny Ivy League kids going to do to me?”
Willcox said focusing on the protest rather than on the event’s cause “only contributes to decentering the narrative completely and shifting focus away from the discourse that can be productive.”
“After someone has spoken about state violence, about ethnic cleansing and the liberation of Black people in this country, and Palestinians, and the only form of interaction that [The Crimson] wants to be written about is the form of backlash — it just ultimately speaks volumes about the reduction of the issue to this one narrative,” Willcox said.
Asmer A. Safi ’23-’24, an organizer for PSC, praised the event for drawing attention to the cause of divestment and “bringing in people from all different walks of life.”
“That’s something that shows the changing of narratives that’s taking place on campus by virtue of the turnouts that we keep getting, and turnouts that keep increasing all the time,” Safi said. “People understand that there’s more to the cause than just the blatant attacks that we get each time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly two weeks after Harvard introduced a new telehealth counseling program, nearly 400 students have registered for the online platform, Harvard University Health Services officials said in an interview Thursday.
Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services announced on Oct. 6 that it would partner with TimelyMD to provide a slate of free telehealth services — including 12 individual counseling sessions per academic year and a variety of self-care content — to Harvard students. The announcement coincided with the launch of Harvard’s new campus-wide mental health awareness campaign, titled "We’re All Human."
Since the launch of the program, 398 students across the University have registered for TimelyCare, though not all have scheduled therapy appointments yet, Counseling and Mental Health Services chief Barbara Lewis said.
More than half of students who registered for the service are between the ages of 23 and 29, Lewis said. Thirty-seven percent of the students registered for TimelyCare are Asian or Asian American students, while 29 percent are White, and 10 percent are Black, according to Lewis.
As of Thursday, only 86 of the registered students had met with TimelyCare counselors.
The wait time to get an appointment with a TimelyCare therapist “is usually two days,” Lewis said.
She said she hopes the accessibility of TimelyCare will free up service capacity at CAMHS to allow clinicians to see more students who require treatment in person.
As part of its efforts to expand access to care, CAMHS is also hiring additional staff for its initial consultations — appointments in which clinicians help students seeking care determine the best course of action.
“We did almost 3,000 initial consults last academic year, which is about 1,500 hours,” Lewis said. “By taking the initial consults out of all the clinicians’ schedule, the hope is it opens up those hours to be therapy hours.”
CAMHS hopes to hire four more clinical access coordinators, who are responsible for the initial consultations, Lewis said. CAMHS currently employs two full-time coordinators.
“The work of our committee last year was to look at what was causing a bottleneck,” Lewis said. “How can we get students into care more quickly, at a time when the need was really high?”
HUHS leaders also addressed the following topics in the interview:
Covid-19 Vaccinations
HUHS Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen said thousands of students have received vaccines through the vaccination clinics held by the school throughout the fall semester.
The school has administered more than 5,000 flu doses and about 2,300 Covid doses, Nguyen said.
The influenza shot and Covid-19 bivalent booster are both required for student enrollment next spring.
“Covid is not gone, but thankfully it is not causing a lot of severe illness,” he said.
“We know that even though the vast majority of students are not at high risk,” Nguyen added. “Like any community, there are going to be high-risk people who are part of that community, and we want to make sure that the entire community is protected,” Nguyen added.
Calls for Expanded Access to Abortions
Nguyen also discussed a letter to HUHS written by the Harvard College Democrats that called on the University to cover the cost of abortion services for students paying the annual student health fee.
“We have been in touch with the Harvard Dems who reached out to us, and we started a dialogue with them,” Nguyen said. “I want to make sure that students understand that with the student health fee, they do get coverage for general gynecologic care at HUHS as part of their primary care services.”
More robust gynecologic services, including abortions, are offered to students through HUHS’ partnership with Mount Auburn hospital. But this care at the hospital is not covered by the student health fee.
“When we think about some of the services around abortion care, that's where it makes sense to go to places that are providing the services at a higher volume, to be able to do it in a consistent way,” Nguyen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council on Monday eliminated all minimum parking space requirements from the city’s zoning code, citing declining car ownership and the need for more open space and housing construction.
The Council voted 8-1 to amend Cambridge’s Zoning Ordinance — which details regulations for new construction in Cambridge — to set all minimum parking requirements to zero, making Cambridge the first Massachusetts city to fully abolish parking minimums. Previously, zoning regulations required new residential developments to have one off-street parking space per unit.
In an interview prior to the meeting, Councilor Marc. C. McGovern, who co-sponsored the policy order, said the change would allow developers “more flexibility” to build parking that meets the needs of their specific projects. He said a downward trend in car ownership should prompt the city to “rethink our relationship to parking.”
“Not everybody who lives in the city is all about cars anymore,” McGovern said. “We have to figure out ways to accommodate different needs, different wants, different desires in a city that is really tight on space.”
“There isn’t going to be anybody out there who’s going to be 100 percent satisfied with whatever we get,” he added. “We all have to give up a little something.”
Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, who voted against the amendment, said the amendment would not reduce traffic, adding that there was “no basis for it whatsoever.”
“We know garages are half to one-third full,” Carlone said during Monday’s meeting. “Instead of saying one-third to a half [parking space] per unit, we’re saying zero. We’re basically throwing it into the developer’s choice.”
He added that the “real problem” was restrictions on the maximum number of parking spaces in the zoning code.
McGovern said in the interview he is not worried about the changes straining Cambridge’s parking capacity.
“There’s a lot of garages and parking lots in Cambridge that are around housing and around commercial development, where the parking lots are only half-used,” McGovern said. “I don’t understand how that would make sense for us to continue that practice.”
Cambridge joins Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Nashville, Tennessee, in having fully abolished parking minimums. In 2019, Somerville eliminated minimums in most areas, and last year, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 signed an amendment abolishing them for affordable housing projects.
The move is the second major zoning code amendment this month from a Council increasingly focused on zoning reform. Last week, it amended the zoning code to significantly increase fees levied on commercial real estate developers that are paid to the city’s fund for affordable housing.
During Monday’s meeting, the Council also voted to ban the sale of fur and fur products in Cambridge.
Councilors also discussed a Monday announcement from City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 about diversity and inclusion on Cambridge’s volunteer boards and commissions. The announcement said volunteer members of the Historical Commission, the Board of Zoning Appeals — which is currently seeking new members — and the Planning Board will begin receiving yearly stipends for their work next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of activists, scientists, and journalists discussed the human impacts of climate change at an event hosted Friday by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
The event, titled “Pale Blue Dot under Pressure: Climate Change, Justice and Resilience in Our Rapidly Warming World,” kickstarted a new five-year focus on climate change at the Radcliffe Institute that seeks to examine the impact of global warming by bringing experts and the public together. The project will include a collaboration between Radcliffe and the newly-founded Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability.
At the event, more than a dozen panelists discussed topics ranging from the warming’s relation to a longer spring allergy season to connections between carbon emission clean-up and waste management.
“This is not a symposium that’s designed for experts to talk to other experts,” said Edo Berger, an Astronomy professor and co-director of the Harvard Radcliffe Institute’s science program, who helped organize the event. “We wanted people who can really break it down and really bring a certain level of energy to their talks and their discussions.”
Debra C. Roberts, co-chair of the working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the IPCC’s 4,000-page report on climate change was “a reality check.”
“Every action and decision each one of us individually takes, from today onwards, is a key part of solving this particular challenge,” Roberts said.
Panelist Lis M. Bernhardt, a member of the United Nations Environment Programme, called for “a global Marshall Plan for climate change” to “protect the most vulnerable” from the threat of environmental disaster and degradation.
Some attendees said they appreciated the way the symposium engaged a variety of experts, professionals, and activists.
Hannah Lee, a Harvard Ph.D. student in epidemiology, said she came to the symposium to learn how scientists can communicate effectively to the public.
“How do you communicate the risk of these events, but also how do you work with non-science partners to bring about change?” Lee said. “That’s been the main lesson.”
Berger, the Radcliffe Institute Science Program co-director, said it is important to foster interaction between scientists and the public on the topic of climate change.
“A lot of the programming that we’re going to do on climate change in the coming years is an outward-facing, multidisciplinary approach,” Berger said.
In her closing remarks, Immaculata De Vivo, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and director of the Radcliffe Institute’s science program, called for optimism in the fight against climate change.
“Hope is often missed,” De Vivo said. “And what I learned from more than one of the speakers was to imagine a better world, imagine with passion and empathy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The end of the Harvard men’s ice hockey season in 2022 was certainly difficult, with a close loss to Minnesota State eliminating the Crimson in the first round of the NCAA tournament. However, senior forward and captain Baker Shore thinks the team’s conference title and tournament appearance can be a stepping stone to much bigger things.
“I think winning the ECAC was really, really big for our team and big for the program and proved that we need to be competing for championships every single year,” Shore said. “That was obviously a tough loss in the NCAA Tournament, but I think it just showed everyone that we're right there and that's the step we want to take this year, to make sure we're back in the tournament and going as far as we can.”
The success of last season’s squad and the strength of the returning roster has led to high expectations for this season, as Harvard is ranked No. 15 in the initial national rankings, while picking up a No. 1 ranking in the ECAC media poll and a No. 2 ranking from the ECAC coaches. Several players also earned spots on preseason all-conference teams and the watchlist for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the best player in college hockey. However, head coach Ted Donato, entering his 19th season behind the bench at Bright-Landry Hockey Center, knows not to take past success for granted.
“We have to establish the level of commitment and work ethic as a group in order to have the success that we want,” Donato said. “I think each year is a new and different year… certainly we return some guys that have had some success last year, and that's a great sign. But I think we have to establish our identity as a group and as a team.”
The Crimson enjoyed a strong season in 2021-2022 in its return to the ice following the canceled 2020-2021 season, finishing with a 21-11-3 record. Despite missing key players throughout the season, including COVID-related absences and former captain Nick Abruzzese and junior forward Sean Farrell departing briefly to play in the Winter Olympics, Harvard hit its stride towards the end of the season, securing an Ivy League title with a 7-2-1 record after February 1. In the ECAC playoffs, the Crimson defeated the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Clarkson to advance to the title game, where they defeated Quinnipiac in overtime to win the Whitelaw Cup. After earning the automatic ECAC berth in the NCAA tournament, Harvard’s season came to an end in a tight 4-3 loss to Minnesota State, the eventual national runners-up.
“I think an identity that we're taking on as a team is championship standards,” Shore said. “So I'm really just focusing every single day on getting better, and making sure that our habits are at the par that we want, so that by the end of the year, we are where we want to be.”
After entering last season as a young team without much college hockey experience, the Crimson now enter 2022-2023 loaded with star power throughout the lineup. Sophomore forward Matthew Coronato returns after a standout rookie season, leading Harvard in scoring with 36 points (18 goals, 18 assists) in 34 games on his way to a berth on the ECAC All-Rookie Team. Junior forward Alex Laferriere also returns after notching 14 goals in his first season in Cambridge and being named the ECAC Rookie of the Year, and senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun returns for his final campaign after being named a Second-Team All-American. Farrell also returns after leading the team in per game scoring with 1.17 points per game. Coronato, Laferriere, and Thrun were all named to the preseason All-ECAC First Team, while Coronato and Farrell earned spots on preseason watchlists for the Hobey Baker Award.
“We had 14 guys that played college hockey last year for the first time…a first-year and a sophomore class,” Donato said. “We're excited to see the development of some of the guys that were here last year that had some success, but are poised to have a lot more success.”
Despite bringing back many key contributors from last season’s roster, there is a leadership void to fill. After the Crimson were eliminated from the NCAA tournament, Abruzzese signed an entry-level professional contract with the NHL’s Toronto Maple Leafs, ending his time in Cambridge after a decorated, All-American career. Former captain Casey Dornbach also departed, transferring to the University of Denver, the defending national champions, where he will play this season as a graduate transfer student. Abruzzese and Dornbach were succeeded as captains by Thrun, Shore, and senior forward John Farinacci.
“Nick and Casey were obviously both great captains,” Shore said. “I think they did a really good job at leading by example, and then also speaking up when they had to. So we’re just trying to emulate what they had.”
In addition to a strong returning lineup, Harvard also welcomes a strong recruiting class to Cambridge, including forwards Joe Miller, Philip Tresca, Marek Hedjuk, and Casey Severo, along with defensemen Ryan Healey and Mason Langenbrunner; all are veterans of the United States Hockey League, the top junior hockey league in the United States. Goaltender Aku Koskenvuo also joins the Crimson following a season playing in U20 SM-sarja, the top junior league in Finland. Despite the depth of the returning roster, Donato believes that the first-years have a chance to make immediate contributions to the team.
“I think as a group we pride ourselves on having a meritocracy in the fact that regardless of what year somebody is or how new they are to the team, we know that the best players are going to play and guys are going to earn their ice time, so we expect some of our younger guys to have a major impact,” Donato said.
In their two preseason tuneups, Harvard picked up where it left off last season, defeating Brown University 5-2 in a scrimmage on October 20th before throttling the University of Guelph 9-0 in an exhibition game on October 22nd, with the team’s new players receiving significant ice time. In the win over Guelph, Koskenvuo posted a shutout, while nine different Crimson players tallied goals, including Tresca and Miller.
After opening the season with four straight home games against ECAC competition, Harvard will hit the road for games against conference foes in RPI and Union College, in addition to a trip to the University of New Hampshire. The Crimson will face a stiff test when they head to Ann Arbor on Thanksgiving weekend for two games against the No. 5 Michigan Wolverines, who boast top NHL prospects Luke Hughes, Frank Nazar, and Adam Fantilli, before traveling to Ithaca for a rivalry game against Cornell on December 2. After an ECAC-heavy schedule through the end of January, including a home game against Cornell on January 28th, Harvard will face Boston College in the first round of the Beanpot Tournament on February 6, before wrapping up the season with a critical road trip to Clarkson at the end of February.
Despite facing top teams and fierce rivals throughout the season, Shore said the team isn’t focused on any one particular game. “There's definitely rivalries throughout the year,” Shore said, “but with that championship standard mindset, I think we really try to focus on a day-to-day and game-by-game basis.”
The Crimson open the season at Bright-Landry Hockey Center with the season opener versus Dartmouth on October 28th at 7:00 pm, before taking on the Princeton Tigers on October 29th at 8:00 pm.

Last weekend, much of Black Harvard trekked down to D.C. for the Howard vs. Harvard football game. Some flew, some drove, but most rode the charter bus that the amazing Black Students Association put together. As someone who really struggled with choosing a PWI (Predominantly White Institution) over an HBCU (Historically Black College and University), this weekend had high expectations—this was my time to soak in what I missed out on but also experience a new place with most of my besties. So, let’s talk about it.
Friday, October 14
Friday morning, two buses were scheduled to leave at 6 a.m. However, the buses did not arrive until around 6:30 because BSA planned for CPT (iykyk). I think this is the only situation in which lying is permissible. We left around 6:45 for the scheduled 8 hour drive to DC. A lot of us slept halfway, only waking when we arrived at the two rest stops for food. *Sidenote: Remind me to later write about the absurd inflation of food on highway rest stops.* As true Harvard students, of course, a number of us did homework along the way. With long rest stops because 50 people ordered food, the snail’s pace of a big ass bus, and the Baltimore and D.C. traffic, the eight hour journey actually took about 12 hours. We made it to the hotel around 6 p.m., and I don't think I’ve ever been happier to walk into a room that was to be shared with four other people. Our lateness forced us to miss the concert we were supposed to attend on Howard’s campus that night, but this did not kill our spirits. So, I took off the sweats that felt incredibly disgusting after eating Popeyes on my lap, and got dressed *in the outfit I specifically planned for this weekend because they were not gonna catch me looking crazy at an HBCU (again, iykyk).*
We had about three hours to kill until the parties started, so I snuck off with Bae (yes, love can exist at this school) to explore D.C. a bit. We found a very yummy Thai restaurant within walking distance and then did what every other tourist does in D.C.: stared at the White House for 20 minutes. My fourth time standing there didn’t disappoint. Later, we headed to Howard for a house party. It had been pubbed as ladies get in free before 11 p.m., but when I got there, I had to pay $3 on Cashapp to get in (lol fine i guess). The party had extreme turnout and amazing music, but it was a bit too crowded for my liking. As in, I kept getting a mouthful of this one girl’s hair. So, we dipped to another. This one had a more low key vibe, but ended up being really fun. I danced, vibed, and then stumbled back to the hotel around 1 a.m. We had a big day ahead.
Saturday, October 15
I woke up to the smell of scented lotion and Dove soap. Everyone knows getting ready with your girls is more fun than the actual event. Makeup and fit advice, hair checks, dancing while shaving armpits: these are the moments I live for. After this joyed-chaos, we were finally dressed at 11 a.m. My roommate and I chugged a Mike’s Hard and then went down to fill up on the overpriced hotel breakfast. When we got to Howard for the tailgating, it hadn’t quite started (even though we arrived 30 minutes after the expected start time). So, my friends and I toured campus wearing our overpriced Harvard Shop merch. All of the Howard students we ran into were extremely welcoming: stopping us to talk, complimenting us as we walked by, giving us directions, etc. Suddenly, I started feeling a hint of guilt for the blank stares I often give Harvard tourists on my way to class.
When the tailgating eventually started, it was lit. It was different from normal awk Harvard tailgates (I guess we had to up our game). Catered food, lots of drinks, and lots of line dancing. We had a good time. When we eventually got to the game, a lot of us were too tired to fully tune in. The game itself was not my favorite pastime, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching Howard’s cheerleaders and band. The halftime show was *chef’s kiss* with a band that dances while playing instruments and majorettes tearing up the field. It was a great finale for me because I left after halftime (haha). A nap was needed. We, however, did win the game, so Go Crimson.
Later that night, the party began again. This one was hosted at a venue, and a lot of us had purchased our tickets before we even got to D.C. I cannot give you the words to describe how fun it was. Actual dancing, Greeks strolling, super crowded but able to move, bar in venue: There was nothing more I could’ve asked for. Though it was a Howard party (and believe me there was some jealousy that this is their every weekend), this moment is when I started to appreciate Harvard for giving me the people I came with — I’d choose you guys a million times over <3
The party ended around 1 a.m. and the attempt to attend another after will not be written about for the public record. Shoutout to the three people there with me; we got through it, y’all.

The morning after. BSA planned a brunch for us at a Black owned restaurant to end the weekend (perfect ending right?). Yummy food and good music soothed the hangovers and a few of us got in some last-minute sightseeing before heading off. Along the way, we played a fun game of How-Many-of-These-Statued-Men-Owned-Slaves. It turned out to be a lot less than we thought. After a group pic in front of the White House, we headed back to the buses for our journey back to Cambridge. It again took 12 hours, and at 12 a.m., we were finally happy to see the filthy Charles. As we turned onto Mount Auburn Street, my bus played “I’m Coming Home” to truly appreciate this specific moment.
Overall, my weekend at Howard was an experience I’ll never forget. Though a lot of us wish we had some of the experiences that come with attending an HBCU, Harvard definitely has its benefits and I think we all appreciated the ability to do this together. It wouldn’t have been possible without the board of our Black Students Association. So thank you, BSA and Roll Crim <3
