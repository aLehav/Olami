After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it becomes clear that President Barack H. Obama’s veto power and the Democratic majority in the Senate will prevent the Republican leadership in the House from achieving many of its goals for this Congress, the party is increasingly looking to another avenue to get its agenda through: the courts.
Republican state attorneys general have filed numerous lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of health care reform, with one Republican judge ruling the bill’s mandate for universal coverage unconstitutional and another one set to follow. New House energy chairman Fred Upton is pinning his hopes for undermining the Environmental Protection Agency’s new set of climate change regulations on the courts, urging the Environmental Protection Agency to wait until the issue makes its way through the courts for the rules to take effect. The House majority has even adopted rules requiring legislation to provide textual support from the Constitution—with the implicit assumption being that liberal policy goals are not authorized by the document.
All of this is dependent on the idea that there is a single correct interpretation of the Constitution that exists independently of the preferences of the current justices of the Supreme Court. This view is hardly limited to conservatives. The liberal legal philosopher Ronald M. Dworkin ’53 has defended this account of the law, arguing that a hypothetical “Judge Hercules,” with complete understanding of all the facts of a case and all the time necessary to mull them over, will arrive at a correct answer.
But, as first noted by those in the legal realism movement that cropped up at Harvard in the early 20th century, this view is badly misguided. For a bill to be constitutional does not mean that it conforms to some one true interpretation of the document. “Constitutional” instead means whatever five members of the Supreme Court want it to mean. Given the current composition of the court, it more specifically means whatever Anthony Kennedy wants it to mean.
On a certain level, this is obvious. The Supreme Court is, in practice, the branch of American government that can issue opinions on the Constitution that bind other branches. Those opinions need not in principle follow from a “correct” interpretation of the Constitution. Harvard law professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 once memorably wrote that, if he were on the court, he would rule in ways that “advance the cause of socialism,” and then justify these rulings through more widely accepted legal language. There is no mechanism preventing justices from taking their own political preferences, cloaking them in ostensibly apolitical legal arguments, and then issuing the result as the opinion of the court.
Of course, it is possible that, even given this possibility, members of the judiciary do not in fact rule this cynically. But there is significant empirical evidence to suggest that partisan affiliation has a lot to do with federal judges’ rulings on controversial issues.  A new movement in legal academia, dubbed the “New Legal Realism,” has used modern quantitative tools to analyze federal court decisions, and found that the political affiliation of judges has a large effect on their jurisprudence. According to one analysis, Democratic appointees take a stereotypically liberal stance in 52 percent of cases, whereas Republicans take one in 40 percent, a significant difference.
What’s more, in three-person federal appeals court panels, the party composition of the panel itself has a strong influence. Panels composed of all Democratic appointees are significantly more likely to arrive at liberal decisions than those with two Democrats and a Republican, and vice versa. But in cases of abortion and capital punishment, judges tend to vote the party line regardless of the panel’s composition. In the most controversial of cases, then, fellow judges cannot even serve as moderating influences.
These findings hold up in the Supreme Court as well. The political scientists Jeffrey Segal and Harold Spaeth’s “attitudinal model” of Supreme Court decision-making argues that the justices’ attitudes–their ideological views, preferences, and so forth–are the most important factor in determining court outcomes. The model is over twenty years old, but has held up consistently to empirical analysis. Indeed, it has shown that attitudes have become even more important in recent decades.
The Supreme Court will ultimately decide which of Obama’s policies are constitutional based on their attitudes, not some objectively correct interpretation of the law. A more useful debate, then, will focus on whether having an unelected institution making decisions based on its personal preferences is desirable.
One answer, notably embraced by Tushnet in recent years, is to reject the Court’s power of judicial review as undemocratic. This view has some practical appeal to liberals who recall the early 20th century court’s resistance to economic regulation, and worry about the current Roberts court’s consistent pro-business bias. But since the 1950s, the Court has also provided assistance for liberal efforts on individual rights, from equal rights for racial minorities, women, and LGBT citizens, to a robust right to privacy. Most Western European countries, as well as Canada, have done without a similar judicial review system, but this has allowed for unconscionable policies, such as “hate speech” statutes and public surveillance systems, at which many Americans rightly recoil.
But ultimately, this is a question of politics. Where one stands on Constitutional interpretation, and the role of courts in deciding it, depends much more on one’s personal political preferences than on some objective account of what the document means.

As we celebrate recent milestones in the fight for Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transsexual equality in the United   States, discriminatory practices against the queer community remain insidiously ingrained in the fabric of our society. One of which, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ban on blood donation by men who have had sexual contact with another male, perpetuates the perspective that the male homosexual population is inherently “at increased risk” for infected donations and should be disallowed from giving plasma.
The FDA rationalizes its position on men who have sex with men (“MSM”) through the claim that this group has the highest incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and is therefore excluded due to safety precautions. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control found that 19 percent of the MSM population in 21 major U.S. cities was infected with HIV. Seemingly, this would provide a solid, impartial warrant for the FDA’s stance. However, if we contextualize the transmissibility and prevalence of various blood-borne illnesses, there is an unquestionable lopsidedness in the qualifications for blood donation. For example, in 2008, state prisoners in California filed a federal lawsuit, citing that as many as 40 percent of California prison inmates become infected with hepatitis C; however, the FDA has no restrictions on former inmates donating plasma. Further, if the FDA seeks to ban certain distinguishable groups in the interest of risk management, why is sexual orientation a target while race is not? Demonstrating this disparity, Hepatitis B, classified by the World Health Organization as 50-100 times more infectious than HIV, is carried by much as 20 percent of the population in East  Asia. Should, then, the FDA prevent East Asian immigrants or descendants from donating blood due to the “increased risk” of hepatitis B infection? No—racial discrimination in the name of “risk management” would be unacceptable. Similarly, excluding the MSM population from donation due to a statistical likelihood that mechanically classifies an individual’s blood as empirically “riskier” is inadmissible.
In June 2010, a Health and Human Services Committee recommended that the FDA uphold the ban established in 1985. Ultimately, the panel concluded that allowing MSM to donate plasma still poses a risk to the safety of the blood supply. However, as the Red Cross reported in September that it could only cover 45 percent of its daily blood needs for medical procedures and emergency situations, equal opportunity must be given a fair chance. A report published by the Williams Institute for Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law estimated that an additional 219,000 pints of blood could be made annually available if the ban on MSM donations were lifted. Indeed, the dire shortage necessitates a reexamination of the antiquated perception that those who engage in gay sex are somehow tainted or substandard. The FDA must shed the 1980s pre-Lawrence v. Texas ideology that the homosexual lifestyle is one that inherently guarantees hazard and immorality.
At Harvard, we unknowingly come into contact with this mentality. As the 2011 Harvard-Yale   Blood Drive begins on January 31st, institutions   of higher education have once again graciously opened their arms to blood   centers. Though these drives serve an important cause, this continual   welcoming subverts the very principle that Harvard and its leaders have   defended in the past—the belief that any organization that operates within   the university must be inclusive and non-discriminatory. In that sense, the   Harvard College Red Cross seems to institutionalize the same recently   discarded notion of the ROTC.
The idea that a queer male should be restricted from participating in any campus activity, whether it be donating blood or enlisting with the ROTC, must always be challenged in order to uphold our university’s maxim of equality. However, a firm campus-wide ban on blood centers is neither a practical nor productive solution to this obstacle. Rather, the university must join in the fight against misinformation and inequity by employing its vast resources of intellect. Those who have the responsibility for knowledge and reason must disseminate both the statistical and moral truths. It is the duty of not only our science-based departments, but also our LGBT advocacy centers to speak out against the conception of homosexuality as a confinement.
A multitude of legal, religious, and organizational limitations have all synthesized to paint the image of the gay individual as intrinsically inferior. Each one of these restraints must be met with outrage. The queer community finally has attained the long overdue right to serve openly in the military, and we are actively engaged in the fight for universally recognized marital rights. However, we must not overlook the multiple dimensions that exist in the quest for equality.

Every day you can read a newspaper article that frets about China’s rise to dominance on the world stage. Today, thanks to Amy Chua, you can read about China’s rise to dominance on the parenting stage. In her controversial Wall Street Journal article and equally controversial best-seller, Amy Chua advocates for strict “Chinese” parenting methods over more lax, “American” methods. The main fault in Chua’s argument is that “Chinese mothers”—a term for an authoritarian, domineering parent, regardless of ethnicity—may raise high-achieving children in the short-term, but, in the long-term, their authoritarian methods stunt success.
“Chinese mothers” have proven so successful in raising hardworking, intelligent offspring because of the immense esteem they hold for education and because of the sacrifices they are willing to undertake. However, there is evidence to believe that their methods do more long-term harm than good. The authoritarian, perfectionist mindset that drives many of these parents tends to vastly underestimate the value of self-motivation and intellectual curiosity as factors of success.
From Chua’s perspective, “Chinese mothers” are any parents who value their children’s achievement over their children’s self-esteem, and who believe it is their responsibility to ensure this achievement. At the heart of it all, “Chinese mothers” believe in teaching their children the strength to overcome obstacles, even at the expense of individuality and a slightly bruised ego.
Chua claims that true confidence is born of hard-earned achievement. She tells an anecdote about forcing her seven-year old daughter to learn a difficult piano piece, denying her bathroom breaks and dinner until after she has completed the task. When she finally masters the piece, both mother and daughter are ecstatic.
But no matter how glorious the aftermath of achievement, the psychological impact of leveraging achievement for parental affection and approval is questionable. While Chua’s daughter may have gained confidence from playing the piano piece, she also gained reinforcement that social approval is earned through achievement. This leads children to disastrously conclude that they need to impress, rather than befriend, the individuals around them in order to gain social acceptance and inclusion.
Child development literature consistently supports an authoritative parenting style as the healthiest and most successful parenting model. By definition, authoritative parents hold authority in the household but are still responsive to their child’s opinions.
By contrast, an authoritarian parent “values obedience as a virtue and favors punitive, forceful measures to curb self-will at points where the child’s actions or beliefs conflict with what the parent thinks is right”. A 1994 study showed that children from authoritarian households actually exhibited lower academic achievement than children from authoritative households, especially as they matured. In the same study, children from authoritarian households showed the highest prevalence of stress-related symptoms of all the parenting styles observed.
Still, the greatest test of confidence comes when these children have to leave their strictly-regimented households for the spontaneous and socially driven environment of a college campus. A recent CNN article by Pforzheimer house masters Erika and Nicholas Christakis discusses the harmful aftereffects that a childhood of “all work and no play” has on college students. The article comments on the difficulty that many college students have with simple skills, such as listening to others and sharing emotions. The Christakises encourage parents to let children have sufficient playtime, arguing that the ability to understand and contribute to society is dependent upon these essential skills.
Chua claims that confidence comes after achievement, but what of initiative and creativity? While the “Chinese mother” parenting style might be effective in raising successful, six-figure salary adults, it is a less convincing model for raising future senators, Pulitzer Prize winners, and Google executives. Denying children the right to make basic decisions independently of their parents’ input denies them the chance to deal with their own mistakes, an essential milestone of adulthood.
Sorry, Amy Chua, but “Chinese mothers” are not superior. Instead, parents who promote the value of education without sacrificing their children’s autonomy are. It would be ideal to combine the best of both worlds and stress academics while giving them room for growth. It would be best to make them understand that there are more important things in life than impersonating Kim Kardashian, but let them watch enough TV to know who Kim Kardashian is. Not only will they turn out to be smart, competent human beings, but they'll be independent, socially adept, and self-motivated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Formed in 1795, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals is America’s oldest collegiate theatre organization and, with time-honored tradition, occupies a celebrated position in the life of the Harvard community. The entire university benefits from the humor, the wit, and the talent on display in each year’s Pudding show, and the Pudding’s bestowing of its annual Woman and Man of the Year Awards are much-anticipated events on the Harvard calendar each year. As usual, we are excited by this year’s selection for Woman of the Year (we’re still waiting for the Man of the Year announcement). Of course, nothing need be said about the talent and the grace of this year’s choice, actress Julianne Moore, whose career accomplishments speak for themselves—her recent performance in “The Kids Are All Right,” for instance, was inspiring.
However, as this year’s prize marks the 60th anniversary of the Pudding’s Woman of the Year Award, it seems like a good time to take stock of the prize and what it means. We wonder whether recognitions like these couldn’t showcase a little more diversity.
An award is not just a celebration of a person’s achievements but also of that person him or herself. In a subtle sense, awards, albeit inadvertently, often cause the public to admire every aspect of a particular person—including things as superficial as his or her particular career choice or, it must be said, ethnic background. Even though these things have nothing to do with the desert of a highly talented performer and that she clearly has earned any honor, the fact that even a few might assume a causal relationship between her worthiness as an entertainer and, say, her race is something that an organization with as large a public persona as the Pudding should consider addressing.
According to the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, this award is granted to performers who have made a “lasting and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment.” In this light, the Hasty Pudding ought to select performers outside the scope of well-known film actors for the accolade. For example, last year, the award was given to Anne J. Hathaway, and the year before it was given to Renée K. Zellweger. People from other industries, such as a theatre, dance, comedy, or music, or even non-movie stars within the film industry such as directors, screenwriters, or producers should be more frequently selected; they have surely also made significant contributions to entertainment as a whole. (The Pudding, after all, puts on a musical every year—why not award more Broadway performers?) That they are not better represented is a disservice to the expansive scope and mission the prize sets for itself.
Additionally, although information about each year’s nominees is not available, since 1951, it’s notable to see that only four African-American women have won the prize: Halle Berry (2006), Whoopi Goldberg (1993), Ella J. Fitzgerald (1982), and Dionne Warwick (1970). While this is certainly not the only metric by which to measure ethnic diversity, it is a significant one. The Hasty Pudding often presents other cultures in their shows, such as in this year’s upcoming production, entitled “Kashmir If You Can.” In that sense, even though Hasty Pudding humor may be all in good fun, it seems a bit irresponsible for the organization to lampoon a variety of cultures and give them frequently politically incorrect comedic treatment (such as the character “Arabian slave, Kareem Inyourpants” in the upcoming show) without displaying multicultural consciousness in the awarding of their trademark prize.
Given that the Hasty Pudding’s annual parade is a public spectacle rather than a private affair, its Woman of the Year selection should better reflect the demographics of its viewing public. Public presence is especially vital to the success of the parade, and, out of respect, this ought to be a consideration on how the Hasty Pudding considers the diversity of its award recipients.
That aside, we’re greatly looking forward to the Hasty Pudding Show, and we’re lucky to have this vibrant performing arts powerhouse on campus.
And, of course, Julianne Moore.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
 
CORRECTION: Jan. 23, 2011
An  earlier version of the Jan. 21 staff editorial "Appraising the  Prize" incorrectly quoted a character description from the Hasty Pudding  Theatricals' website. The quoted description of Kareem Inyourpants is  "Arabian slave," rather than "Arabian slave boy."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number of students admitted to Harvard University Health Services for alcohol-related illnesses last semester nearly matched the total number of cases treated during the entire previous year, according to tutors who attended a meeting yesterday on advising and alcohol.
At the meeting—a mandatory gathering for all resident tutors—Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and University Provost Steven E. Hyman presented data detailing the number of alcohol-related cases treated at UHS’s Stillman Infirmary over the past several years, tutors said.
“The number of students admitted for the fall [was] pretty high in comparison to previous yearly totals,” said Marta E. Sobur, a resident tutor in Lowell House. “We were a little surprised.”
Ashwin Kaja ’07, a resident tutor in Kirkland House, noted that a higher number of UHS visits might not mean that students are drinking more copiously or more frequently.
“It could also reflect a positive trend that efforts to convince students to seek medical help when they need it are also taking effect,” Kaja said.
The bulk of the session was dedicated to a discussion among tutors about how they should talk about drinking-related issues with the students in their Houses and address dangerous drinking when it occurs.
“It’s always about building a trusting relationship with the students,” said Lowell House tutor Van C. Tran.
Despite University policy which, in accordance with Massachusetts law, forbids students under the age of 21 from consuming alcohol, Tran said that some tutors yesterday emphasized the importance of advising students to drink in moderation rather than counseling them not to drink at all.
Sobur said that the focus of the meeting was on sharing past experiences and time-tested tactics for interacting with students rather than on discussing the College’s formal policies toward alcohol use.
Adams Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell said that the meeting sparked conversations among tutors which she anticipates will continue throughout the semester.
“This is something that we really need to work together on and there will be lots of opportunities to weigh in along the way,” Howell said.
Some tutors said that they believe the College plans to publicly release the data on alcohol-related infirmary admissions.
Though he was not sure what triggered the meeting, Tran said that a winter gathering of all resident tutors is unusual.
“We have always had an orientation week at the beginning of every year in September,” Tran said.“Over the past six years...we never quite had this sort of mid-year orientation.”
The first portion of the meeting was devoted to a discussion of sophomore advising.
Spokespersons for Hammonds and Hyman did not provide comment last night.
The Director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Ryan M. Travia did not return requests for comment last night.

The former editor of Newsweek and a reporter for Pakistan’s oldest English-language newspaper are among this spring’s fellows at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, who were announced Wednesday.
“We have a mixture of practicing journalists and scholars, both foreign and domestic,” said Alex S. Jones, director of the Shorenstein Center. “In selecting the fellows, we try to reflect the values and democracy of the Kennedy School.”
Four new fellows and one returning fellow will spend the semester pursuing research interests at the University.
Wajahat S. Khan—a former reporter for Pakistan’s The Dawn and its monthly The Herald—is one of the youngest fellows and the first Pakistani Shorenstein Fellow in the history of the program.
“As someone so young and not from the U.S. or from an academic establishment, it’s a huge deal,” Khan said.
Khan’s project investigates the media’s coverage of the war on terrorism, focusing on how the media is manipulated by intelligence and government agencies. He also plans to study the Pakastani media’s economic, financial, and political biases.
“At the end of the day, I want to have the academic and intellectual experience and absorb as much as I can during this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” he said.
Another fellow, Bob Calo—a senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley and a former producer at NBC News—said the fellowship provides an opportunity for journalists and scholars to “get out of their usual work cycle and work with people to form new ideas.”
During the semester, Calo will examine the disengagement of audience from news media and the media’s responsibility to engage its audience.
“It’s an uncomfortable idea as a journalist,” he said. “The American audience has lost a lot of trust. Could it possibly be our fault? Are we writing the wrong kind of story?”
Since 1986, the Center has funded journalists and scholars in news media or politics for a semester-long research project. Each fellow, chosen by a committee of senior staff at the center, will spend the next few months researching and writing a paper.
Jones said the fellows were selected based on their qualifications as distinguished journalists or scholars and on the basis of their project proposals, which examine the interrelations among press, politics, and public policy.
“We fund the fellows to enrich the experience of our students at the Kennedy School,” Jones said, “and to help them generate their work and contribute to the depth of knowledge in media.”
Other Shorenstein Fellows for this semester are Alexis Gelber, a former top editor at Newsweek, a published author, and an adjunct professor at New York University’s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute; Neil A. Lewis, a former correspondent for The New York Times, a writer for numerous magazines including The New Republic and Rolling Stone, and a professor of media law at Duke Law School; and Sandra Rowe, a former editor of The Oregonian in Portland and past president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, who is returning again this semester as part of her year-long fellowship.

Jeannie Tse ’14 hustled to her day-long policy and education class that began at 9 a.m. and featured a series of lectures and visits to public and charter schools in Boston. After a short dinner break, she headed over to a movie screening and discussion from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.
While this may appear to be an overloaded semester course load, it is in fact Tse’s schedule during this week’s Optional Winter Activities Week.
The College administration does not have data on student participation in its inaugural OWAW events, planning instead to survey students afterwards.
But Tse’s story reflects the College’s intention to transform the last week before the beginning of classes into an opportunity to explore new topics and activities.
“I learned so much about the American education system,” Tse, who is from Hong Kong, said about her student-organized course called “Breaking the Mold.” “These are the issues that everyone needs to pay attention to.”
Erin Goodman, manager of winter break operations for the College, said the administration approved about 100 programs for the week, ranging from lectures and  workshops to ice skating and playing paint ball. But she said she did not know how many students to expect.
“Many undergraduates said that they wanted to pursue activities that they wouldn’t ordinarily have the chance to participate in during the school year,” Goodman said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette. “They also wanted an opportunity to build community and prepare for the spring term and the summer.”
“For a first go with [OWAW], we could not be more pleased with the turn-out,” said Amy A. Howell, internships director for the Institute of Politics, which organized service trips and workshops as well as walk-in office hours.
According to Howell, more than 50 students came to her office hours to inquire about summer opportunities, politics, and public service.
“I think OWAW really opens up opportunities for students to be exposed to our program,” Howell said.
“I’m hopeful that the University is going to see that OWAW should be something that’s repeated for future J-Terms,” said IOP President Jeff F. Solnet ’12.
Some students participating in OWAW programs said the events exposed them to new fields.
“I decided to participate because I’ve always been interested in theater and have been looking for a community within the school,” said Rebecca H. Kwan ’14, who was in the theater workshop of the January Arts Intensive, a five day College-organized program that offered seven different tracks.
“I am hearing a lot from the students that having a space outside of the usual semester’s rigorous schedule to work on a particular artistic interest on a daily basis has been rewarding, mind-opening, exhausting and amazing,” Bess Paupeck, a program manager in the Arts and Humanities Division wrote in an e-mail.
Alejandra G. Martinez ’13 participated in the Arts Intensive’s poetry program.
“It allows the opportunity to explore the different aspects of what a university can be, especially the arts,” she said.

With the appointment of a former diplomat, two Congressmen—one Democrat and one Republican—a capitol hill operative, and a former adviser to American forces in Iraq, organizers at the Institute of Politics say that they have tried to look beyond just candidates’ resumes and select a crop of spring fellows willing to engage with students on campus.
“[The selection committee] wanted to see enthusiasm for working with people in college and their ability to build real relationship with the people who were ultimately going to become their liaisons and attend their study groups,” said Cyrus B. Kornfeld ‘12, co-chair of the Fellows and Study Groups Program.
According to Program Manager Eric R. Andersen, the program considers input from students involved with the IOP as well as other student groups and tries to bring in fellows that will appeal to as large a group of students as possible. He added that the selection committee focuses on bringing a group that had a diverse group of experiences and was ideologically balanced.
Many of the fellows said they were excited to share their personal experiences with Harvard students and faculty. They also said they hoped to use their unique perspectives to shed light on the political process.
Caroline J. Croft, a former senior advisor at the State Department, said that she would gear her study group toward issues of diplomacy, democracy, and politics. She said she hopes to cover topics from globalization to counterterrorism in an effort to encourage young people to dedicate themselves to a life of service.
Ellen Qualls, a senior adviser to former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, said that she hopes to share an inside perspective of her involvement in recent legislative efforts, including health care reform.
Former Congressman Bart Stupak said that he hopes to start off his study group with a town hall style meeting to learn what topics most interest the students. But he said that he also plans to touch on crucial events with which he has been involved, including the health care debate.
Stupak rose to national prominence during the debate over health care reform by attaching an amendment to the House version of the bill that would have prevented federal funds from covering abortion procedures.
The Congressman backed down from his amendment when President Obama agreed to sign an executive order that included restrictions on federal funding for the procedure.
Along with discussing his own eighteen-year tenure as an elected official, Stupak said he hopes to inspire young people to follow a path to public service.
“I believe strongly that young people need to be involved in politics and public service,” Stupak said. “Government really needs their energy to help us solve problems. They can bring enthusiasm and creativity to many of the problems we confront as a nation.”
John McConnell, a speechwriter for the George W. Bush White House, expressed a similar desire to inspire college students to get involved in political life.
“I am looking forward to sharing as much of what I’ve learned as possible with the students, and I hope I will be able to inspire students to pursue a career in politics or at the very least become better aware of how the political world works,” McConnell said.

Allston residents expressed both excitement and distrust at last night’s Harvard Allston Task Force meeting which focused on the Harvard Business School’s plan to build an Innovation Lab in the neighborhood.
At the meeting, Gabe Handel, managing director of Business School Dean Nitin Nohria’s office, presented a timeline and highlighted the benefits local businesses and entrepreneurs will gain from the I-Lab—a space where locals and University affiliates could discuss and realize their business plans through collaboration.
Handel noted that the Lab—which will occupy the currently vacated 125 Western Ave., a building that housed the radio station WGBH until 2007—will not only provide a coffee shop and a 24/7 public meeting space, but will also connect  faculty and students across Harvard’s schools.
“The problem with the modern university is that resources are separated into discipline silos, but the Innovation Lab will help bring these resources together,” said Handel. “We need to make this a vibrant place ensuring it gets students and faculty from across Harvard working together.”
But some Allston residents were skeptical of the plan and said that they were concerned Harvard affiliates would be given precedence over community members when accessing I-Lab resources, such as mentoring, training, and academic opportunities.
Several community members voiced a lack of trust in the University and concerns that Harvard has a history of breaking its promises.
Many noted that the University’s plan to aid residents was vague.
“This community deserves specifics, goals, and a structured institutionalized plan so this project can deliver as the Education Portal has,” said Allston resident and Task Force member Bruce E. Houghton, referring to the Harvard Allston Education Portal that provides academic mentoring to local youth.
But many locals expressed excitement about the possible benefits the project will offer the community. Allston Civic Association President Paul Berkeley suggested that this project has the potential to compensate for the businesses lost in the past decade as a result of Harvard’s decision to halt construction on the Harvard Allston Science Complex, a $1 billion  project that was indefinitely put on hold  in Dec. 2009 due to financial constraints and left many properties on Western Ave. vacated.
“Harvard can help create new benefits through the I-Lab by creating businesses that were lost,” Berkeley said. “It’s a step in the right direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Residents of Old Quincy, a section of Quincy House which will begin renovations in June 2012, say there are a number of improvements that they hope will be made to the House as part of the College’s ambitious House renewal project, including improvements to the building’s leaky ceilings, aging ventilation systems, and flawed floorplan.
The College announced Jan. 14 that Old Quincy, completed in 1930, will be the first section of the 12 Houses to be renewed, but the announcement did not include details about the nature or scope of the renovations.
“One of my blockmates had problems with mold,” said Marygabrielle Prezioso ’13, a resident of Old Quincy.
Many students, as well as Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke, expressed dissatisfaction with a common Old Quincy rooming setup that requires students to walk through their roommate’s bedroom to reach the bathroom.
“There are beds in the common room. Whoever’s living in the common room has to walk through his roommate’s bedroom to get to the bathroom. That’s very undesirable,” Gehrke said.
Although the specific plans for Quincy renovation have not yet been finalized, the House Program Planning Committee, which released a report on House renewal in 2009, has drawn up a number of goals for the construction process. Gehrke wrote in an e-mail that these goals include increased privacy and safety, special housing accommodations for those who need them, and improved sustainability efforts.
Based on these guidelines, Gehrke wrote he expects that rooms with walkthrough bedrooms will be eliminated. He also hopes that entryway size will become more consistent and that tutors will be located closer to their respective entryways.
Since the renovations are scheduled to take an estimated 15 months, according to the press release, the approximately 180 residents of Old Quincy will have to be relocated, though they will remain affiliates of Quincy.
One possible location for the “swing” housing is apartments in the area owned by Harvard Real Estate Services, according to the Jan. 14 press release.
Gehrke said that during the construction process he will prioritize maintaining a sense of community among students still living in Quincy and those displaced to “swing” housing.
“We want those students to continue to feel that they are a very important part of Quincy House,” Gehrke said.
Neil T. Curran ’12, co-chair of the Quincy House Committee, said that the committee planned to help Gehrke with his efforts.
“They’ll still be a part of the House,” Curran said. “We know what we have to do to get people involved, and at some point it does fall upon our students.”
The House renewal announcement has had very little impact on the Quincy House Committee’s immediate plans, Curran said. However, he said that the committee will take it into account when discussing their spring housing lottery.
Old Quincy contains mostly sophomore housing.
Catherine G. Katz ’13, a history concentrator who lives in Old Quincy, said that she hoped that planners would be mindful of the House’s history during construction.
“I really hope that they maintain that sense of history and identifying with the past. Just because you can make all these improvements and have all these newfangled things, we shouldn’t necessarily do that just because we can,” Katz said.

Former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers will teach economics classes both at the College and at the Harvard Kennedy School this spring when he returns to campus after serving two years as a senior adviser at the White House.
At the College, Summers will co-teach Economics 1420: “American Economic Policy” with Economics Professors Martin S. Feldstein ’61 and Jeffrey B. Liebman, an academic line up that will put some of the University’s biggest names in one course.
“[The class] is a broad survey of American policy ranging from financial crisis to health care, from social security to energy policy,” Summers said.
Feldstein and Liebman, who have both worked with Summers in the past, invited him to get involved with the course after learning he was coming back to Harvard.
Summers left Harvard—where he served as president between 2001 and 2006—to work at the White House in Nov. 2008. He announced his intention last fall to return to Harvard where he would likely have lost tenure had he not decided to return to Cambridge.
In addition to his course at the College, Summers will also teach a Kennedy School module—a half-semester course—titled “Crisis Economics: History and Evaluation of the Policy Response to the Great Recession.”
The class will be open to all Harvard students and examine global trade, the International Monetary Fund, and different kinds of financial regulation, Summers said.
“We’ll try to focus on both the substance and process of economic policy, emphasizing the decisions made in the first six months [of the economic crisis],” said Summers, who played a significant role in crafting the Obama administration’s response to the recent financial crisis.
Summers, who served as assistant to the President for economic policy and director of the White House national economic council during the recession, said his desire to reflect on his experience at the White House prompted him to teach this class.
“I wanted to try to think through the decisions that we have made,” he said, adding he thought students would be interested in learning more about how the crisis was handled.
“I will try to bring together my experience as an economist with my practical work,” Summers added.
The module will begin the week of March 21, according to Kennedy School spokesperson Doug L. Gavel.
Summers will also serve as the director of the Sharmin and Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government that focuses on international policy at the Kennedy School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard and Northeastern faced off Wednesday night, the two hockey teams found themselves heading in different directions.
The Crimson (3-13, 2-9 ECAC) entered the contest on a four-game losing streak while the Huskies (7-10-4, 6-7-3 Hockey East) had won three of their last four. Neither team bucked the trend Wednesday, as Northeastern downed visiting Harvard, 3-0, at Matthews Arena. Huskies goaltender Chris Rawlings made 34 saves to keep the Crimson off the scoreboard.
“It was a frustrating game—just never felt like we got anything going,” sophomore Marshall Everson said. “I thought we played a decent first period, and after that, we got away from our game a little.”
Although Harvard asserted control of the ice early in the first period, the attack could not finish its opportunities. The Crimson pressured the Huskies and amassed a lead in shots, but Rawlings’ strong performance in net kept the score notched at zero.
With a minute remaining in the first frame, Northeastern tallied its first goal of the night. After receiving a pass from Mike Hewkin, forward Steve Quailer skated through the middle of the Harvard defense and slotted the puck past freshman goaltender Raphael Girard. Girard, making the first start of his career, saved 34 shots on the night.
“He kept us in it all the way to the end,” Everson said of Girard. “Overall, he made a lot of really big saves...Without him playing well, the game could have been out of our hands.”
Early in the second period, the Huskies added to the lead. Forward Braden Pimm tallied a goal at the 3:38 mark, finishing a rebound he collected from teammate Zak Stone’s shot. Both squads failed to convert on their power plays. Harvard went 0-4 while the Huskies squandered six man-advantage chances of their own.
Throughout the game, the Crimson struggled to stay out of the box, as the team committed 10 penalties, resulting in 28 minutes of Northeastern power play—something that has been a problem for Harvard all season.
“We can’t control [penalties] completely,” said Crimson co-captain Chris Huxley after the Jan. 15 game against Boston University. “We just have to try to be careful and be more disciplined.”
One highlight of the game was Harvard’s shorthanded play. The Crimson allowed just eight shots while down a skater.
Continuing their balanced attack, the Huskies notched a single goal in the final frame. At the 9:55 mark, Mike McLaughlin put Northeastern up for good with Rob Dongara and Brodie Reid providing assists.
Wednesday’s contest marked the second time Harvard has been shut out this season. But the empty scoreboard was not for lack of shots. Northeastern only held a 37-34 advantage over the Crimson in attempts on net. Harvard also found some early success in the game by playing physically, creating turnovers, and getting pucks on net.
“The [Northeastern] goalie played well,” Everson said. “We were able to get some good chances and shots on, [but] every time we got a rebound, he seemed to be there.”
The shutout also brought an end to junior Alex Killorn’s 10-game point streak, in which the forward registered four goals and seven assists. Killorn, along with senior Michael Biega, led the Crimson with five shots against Northeastern.
“Alex is obviously a really talented forward,” Everson said. “He does things in all three zones, and that allows [us] to create offense off him...When he’s out on the ice for us, it’s a big advantage.”
In his first game back from injury, sophomore forward Alex Fallstrom registered three shots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
And the winning streak extends to 18.
In its first match of the New Year, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) captured a 9-0 victory over No. 12 Bates (7-8, 2-3 NESCAC) at the Bates Squash Center.
Entering Wednesday’s match, no one on the Crimson squad had faced the Bobcats before, but this did little to sway the crew’s dominant play. The team did not drop a single game en route to opening the second half of its season with a win.
“The match was great,” captain Alisha Mashruwala said. “I think it was a really good experience for us and for them.”
The senior also commended her team for its strong play after over a month off from training together.
“Everyone played exceptional squash. It’s always hard coming back from a long break, and the team did a very good job.”
With sophomore Laura Gemmell, currently top-ranked in the College Squash Association (CSA) Preseason Rankings, sitting the match out to “rest a bit and train a bit,” according to Mashruwala, junior and seventh-ranked Nirasha Guruge played in the No. 1 slot.
Guruge defeated her competition, sophomore and CSA national women’s player of the week Cheri-Ann Parris, in three frames, 11-4, 11-7, 11-2.
“I was really happy with the way I played,” Guruge said. “She put up a good fight, and we had a good match.”
A Bates freshman, 83rd-ranked Ashley Brooks, also posed a challenge. Facing off against Harvard sophomore No. 17 Natasha Kingshott in the third slot, the rookie accrued the most points of the Bobcat team but still lost the matchup, 11-3, 11-8, 11-6.
The showing was impressive for Kingshott as well, who jumped up the ladder from her usual play at No. 5 to No. 3.
The key to the team’s success, according to Guruge, was its mindset prior to the match.
“Our coaches and our captain told us to not take it easy,” Guruge explained. “[So] we didn’t take the match easy. We went into it thinking we were going to do our best. I think that’s why no one had a problem.”
Mashruwala also credited the squad’s intense training regimen.
“We got back around the 10th of January,” the Mumbai, India, native said. “We’ve been using this time to work really hard. We’ve been practicing a lot…and working on specific shots…and getting our fitness back up.”
Clearly, the training worked for Mashruwala—in her match in the No. 2 position, the 13th-ranked senior dropped only two points against Bobcat Maura Neal, snagging the win, 11-0, 11-1, 11-1.
The rest of the team also put up strong numbers in the win over Bates.
In her first match of the 2010-2011 season, senior Alexandra Zindman blanked sophomore Liza Dorison at No. 9, 11-4, 11-3, 11-5.
Sophomore No. 42 Sarah Mumanachit, senior No. 9 June Tiong, and junior No. 37 Cece Cortes added three more tallies in the wins column at spots 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
Rounding out the results, senior No. 29 Bethan Williams nabbed a 3-0 victory in the No. 7 position, and sophomore No. 51 Vidya Rajan did the same at the No. 8 spot.
The 9-0 win was very encouraging, then, for a squad looking at an extremely competitive lineup in the coming weeks.
“The team went into the match really excited about getting the second half of the season started,” Mashruwala said. “It felt good to go in there and play well.”
Harvard’s next match will be the biggest test yet of the crew’s abilities: No. 3 Trinity visits the Barnaby Courts on Jan. 26.
The Bantams roster boasts a number of talented athletes, including No. 2 Pamela Hathway, who faced Gemmell last season in finals of the CSA individual championship.
“We’re going to keep training and not take the matches easy,” Guruge said.
