After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Liberals and conservatives alike have been abuzz over the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which states that corporations can be exempted from a law to which their owners object from a religious standpoint. The case began with the Affordable Care Act mandate that their employers cover birth control. This stipulation made the evangelical Christian owners of Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts supply store chain, feel that their right to freedom of religion had been disrespected. They took their case to court, and the justices sided with them.
As a person of faith and a feminist, I object to the Supreme Court’s verdict in the Hobby Lobby case.
I am an Orthodox Jew who lives according to the strictures of my faith–only eating kosher food and abstaining from work every Saturday. A follower of normative Orthodox halakha (Jewish law), I – in my personal life – hold that birth control is permissible only in specific instances, and only when used in accordance with rabbinical consultation. Consequently, I understand why Hobby Lobby’s owners feel ill at ease with birth control; my own religious beliefs are not too dissimilar from theirs.
However, if I one day own a corporation, I will not expect my religious objections to supersede my employees’ right to adequate health care and the choice to use the Pill or IUDs. Hobby Lobby is an employer, not a member of the clergy or a practitioner of medicine. Consequently, it should not have the right to make religious or health decisions for its workers. Hobby Lobby has no right to refuse to pay for its employees’ healthcare, regardless of whether the health decisions its workers make adhere to its religious standards.
Though Hobby Lobby’s owners and I share a commitment to religious convictions, their expression of it is very foreign to me. I was raised in an Orthodox Jewish home, in a world where modernity and religiosity were supposed to work in tandem, rather than in opposition. My parents instilled in me the Judaic values relevant to life in America today, and the Hobby Lobby case brings to mind some of the core lessons my parents and community imparted to me.
Growing up, I was taught to value the separation of church and state. A conflation of the two tends to be bad news for religious minorities, and I always knew that Jews – particularly Orthodox ones – were a tiny percentage of the overall population. Historically, when Jews lived under theocracies or were ruled by governments whose leaders were possessed of a religious fervor, it was rarely a portent of good things to come. The statehouse is supposed to be a secular institution that does not interfere with religious issues, and it’s unfortunate that the Supreme Court forgot about this.
If someone wants to do something against Judaism or Orthodoxy, nu, let them do it, how does it hurt you? Why needlessly get involved in other people’s personal issues? If the woman down the block from me is taking birth control pills, how does it affect my life in any way? Why would her actions be any of my business? Live and let live; let her practice birth control however she feels comfortable with it, and I will too.
Certainly, not every Orthodox Jew would agree with these values; several have made a career out of campaigning against “dangers to society,” such as reproductive choice. However, my Judaism has never been one that is defined through limits on the freedoms of others. My Judaism is a set of divine rules that I have taken upon myself, and would never impose on anyone else. I believe that these are holy laws, but to force them on others is at best unkind and at worse sacrilege.
From a legal perspective, this case sets a frightening precedent. The Onion recently posted a satire piece reporting that Hobby Lobby stoned a gay employee to death and was protected by the law for its actions. Though the article was intended as humor, perhaps it is a harbinger of times to come. If Hobby Lobby can say that it won’t cover birth control for religious reasons, where will the line be drawn? Can it also refuse to employ queer folks, “for religious reasons”? Will Jewish and Muslim employers be spared from covering medications made with pork products? If a company is owned by someone who follows Christian Science, can it legally refuse to provide health insurance for any employee? There’s no telling how far companies looking to save a few bucks will go, using religious convictions as their guise. Yes, I am a committed feminist.
Yes, I am a committed Orthodox Jew. Yes, I am committed to universal access to birth control. None of these three are contradictory, and all of them contribute to my belief that the Supreme Court’s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby was flawed and foolish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month’s Supreme Court decision in the Hobby Lobby case has stirred outrage because of its favoring of narrow religious interests over women’s reproductive health. Handed down days after the Court voided Massachusetts’s buffer-zone statute, the case demonstrates that the health concerns of half the American people do not receive adequate legal protection. Meanwhile, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Hobby Lobby dissent has become a sensation for its cool dispatching of the Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito.
 While much of the anger has focused on the verdict’s immediate implications for women’s health, Ginsburg's dissent shows that just as much ridicule should accompany the Court's interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. As Ginsburg writes, the Court’s expansive reading of the law–that for-profit corporations can use a statute written with narrow intentions to wriggle out of civil regulations–has led the Supremes to “[venture] into a minefield.” The exact contours of that minefield only support her reasoning.
 Holding people of different religious beliefs to different sets of civil law has a long history across various polities. The Ottoman Empire with its millet system provides the most famous example. Under the Ottomans, the Sublime Porte recognized the temporal and spiritual power of non-Muslim officials, such as the Greek Orthodox Patriarch, who administered independent systems of civil law for their own communities. This arrangement granted religious minorities significant autonomy, but existed alongside official discrimination and inequality before the law.
 Such accommodations extended into modern Western states that we could hardly caricature as part of the “unenlightened” Orient. The 17th century British state, for example, recognized a Presbyterian Church of Scotland separate from the established Church of England. But Anglicanism reigned supreme elsewhere, with the British monarch as Defender of the Faith. 
 Opposition to this state policing of personal conscience was, of course, a key motivator of Founding Fathers like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. The First Amendment was intended to prohibit the government support for religion which was the norm across the Atlantic–from Shannon on Ireland's west coast to the shores of the Bosporus at the edge of Europe.
 What does this brief history of religion and government have to do with Hobby Lobby? As Ginsburg put it, “approving some religious claims while deeming others unworthy of accommodation could be ‘perceived as favoring one religion over another,’ the very ‘risk the Establishment Clause was designed to preclude.’” The Supreme Court has now set the precedent that Christians–even ones who have elected to participate in the national economy as owners of for-profit corporations–can opt out of providing their employees with contraception. The same, however, may not hold true for Jehovah's Witnesses, Scientologists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and Christian Scientists who object to other heath care mandates, a point Justice Ginsburg contemplates. Such favoritism might leave Jefferson and Madison turning in their graves. 
 What's more, these possible exceptions are more than academic. One of the cases cited by the majority in Hobby Lobby is Brauenfeld v. Brown, in which the Supreme Court ruled that Sunday closing laws did not impermissibly burden the religious rights of Orthodox Jews. Perhaps the current majority would have come to a different conclusion in Brauenfeld. But with the decision in Hobby Lobby, they implied that business owners who object to providing their employees contraception are more favored under the law than Jews who wish to observe a different day of rest. 
 The idea that some religious people with certain religious beliefs can opt out of commercial regulations cannot be squared with the First Amendment. To draw from Ginsburg once more, the regulations at issue in Hobby Lobby–arguably unlike those in Brauenfeld–do not inhibit what Hobby Lobby's owners “may believe...or do.” But the Supreme Court has decided that some beliefs deserve special exemptions, even in the civil sphere. Under the Ottomans, it was your millet that determined what laws applied. In 18th century England, it was the political connections of your church. Nothing so dramatic will to occur in 21st century America. Nonetheless, under the Roberts court, the extent of your religious liberty may depend on the sympathy of the justices who hear your case.
 So, until Ginsburg's dissent becomes law, All Hail Samuel Alito, Defender of the Faith.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When people see depression and economics in the same sentence, they assume that the writer is talking about a severe, costly economic downturn, much like the one in the 1930s. Well, the economy is isn’t in a depression–it is suffering from depression. The evidence is right in front of our eyes, and costs us untold billions. 
Clinical depression is one of the most common afflictions among college students and people of working age, and has made its far share of headlines here at Harvard.  About one in 10 adults at any given time exhibits symptoms of major depressive disorder, which include lack of motivation, suicidal thinking, decreased concentration, and persistent feelings of sadness and low self-esteem.
Students with depression are twice as likely to drop out of college as their healthy peers, and have GPAs that are up to 50 percent. These drops in learning and educational attainment can start as early as middle school. The emotional toll this exacts from families and peers is devastating. 
Despite its status as a leader in health-care delivery, America is plagued with a depression epidemic, and has not treated it very well. An estimated $44 billion dollars is lost in workplace productivity each year to depression. That’s the equivalent of 27 sick days for each depressed worker. If the worker arrives at the office every day, the employer loses about 10 percent of productivity. That accounts to a loss of about 5.6 hours every week for each depressed worker, around one-eighth of the workweek. 
And that's only on the job.  When you account for the other costs of depression (medical, family etc.), the cost doubles to over $85 billion per annum, more than the yearly cost of the war in Afghanistan. An individual who suffers from depression can expect on average to make 20 percent less in wages during his lifetime than if he were not depressed. Eighty-five billion dollars is enough to create 1.7 million jobs that pay over median income.  
Between 2000 and 2012, the economy grew by over $2 trillion according to real GDP numbers (corrected for inflation). Depression has wiped out almost half of that.  For a country struggling so much to get back on its feet, depression is shooting us in the foot over the short term by effecting productivity, aggregate demand and many other factors that could improve current recessionary conditions.  
In addition, the losses in human capital should not be ignored, as they could have profound effects later on.  A recent study from the University of Chicago reported that, “The availability of skilled labor is potentially much more important for development than [previous studies] have so far suggested." To be effective and make money in the modern economy, the importance of technological knowledge (coding, statistics etc.) is paramount.  If students are dealing with depression and not achieving their academic potential, long run growth of the economy could suffer due to a less skilled workforce.
Depression, conceivably, could benefit the economy. When people pay to treat depression with medications and therapies, they buy that service from companies and people. Theoretically, this might recycle that money back into the economy via wages and consumption. Unfortunately, little of that money is actually put back into the economy. So where is it going?
Treating depression is costly. One study estimates that Americans spend $11.3 billion a year on anti-depressants, more than it cost to put on the London Olympics. And the firms, like Pfizer and Eli Lilly, which make these drugs are all publicly-traded. Much of the profit made from sales of these medications goes to stock holders in dividends, and not back into the economy as spending. (For reference, over 80 percent of the stock market is owned by the top 10 percent-richest Americans.)  
Depression has tangible effects on the nation’s economy and our shared prosperity. Is there a simple answer to the country’s malaise? Of course not. But we need to talk about it. And Americans need to talk to someone.

While people are in the business of suing Tinder I would like to issue a formal complaint of my own: Tinder irrevocably tainted my reputation. And, yes, I still think that I have a reputation to protect.
You see, for as long as I remember, I have been telling people that I don’t use Tinder. But, as I just found out, it turns out I’m a liar: let me explain. 
I first got Tinder in February 2013, but it was strictly for informational purposes. And, yes, I know this is what everyone says. But I have an article to prove it. 
However, I quickly realized that having the Tinder app might send the wrong message. That message being that I use Tinder. So in March of the same year, I deleted my profile. 
Or so I thought. 
A recent event has led me to believe that I never actually properly disposed of the profile. 
It was June 2014, the summer solstice, and a friend was telling me about a Tinder date. Due to the combination of caffeine and extended daylight, I was persuaded into downloading Tinder. 
So I got the app, but once again, not for actual dating purposes. I downloaded it ironically—and I realize, that at this point, the term “ironically” might be devoid of all meaning. 
Now usually when you download a dating app, you have to fill out some generic questions, reveal some generic credit card information, and disclose  your ideal height and gender. But for some reason I didn’t have to: my profile was already complete.
I probably should have found this suspicious. But instead of worrying about identity theft I took the fact that all of my photos were already in place and that my height was already entered with a margin of error of 18 inches, as a sign that the Tinder gods were on my side—the man harvest was upon me. 
I really should have been suspicious that the upper age limit for men was set at 37—but hey, who was I to question the plans of the Tinder Gods. 
So instead of questioning, I started swiping. 
And everyone was a match. I mean everyone: The guy posing with his dog, the dog posing without his guy, the 34-year-old that looked 50. Every single person that I approved of, instantly approved of me back. Hundreds of men, all in a matter of minutes. The floodgates had opened. 
But after matching with three dozen more profiles, I begin to question my allure: No profile is that swipeable, even a 6 foot 7 brunette. 
Although I recognized that it might have been possible that everyone was mistakenly swiping for my good looking friend, who is seen hugging me in photo number two, the chance that hundreds of people were all interested and active on Tinder during the two minute window that I had a profile seemed slim. 
And that is when it hit me: my profile was never deleted. 
My app was gone, but the photos of me, my age, and my location, were floating around in the cloud this whole time. All of my matches had already approved of my profile, weeks, maybe months ago. 
I was like one of those pregnant girls who doesn't realize that she is on MTV until a baby pops out. Except instead of a newborn, I just had thirty unrequited “heyyyys” from men in a ten mile radius. 
And the worst thing about this whole situation, was not Caspar, who asked if I would sit on his face, but the fact that my reputation was ruined: I was a long-term Tinder user. I had a dating profile, and I had it non-ironically. 
So I deleted my Tinder—for real. But I still fear that it was too late for me. Who knows how many boys and old men saw my profile for a split second before passing on to the next six foot brunette?
So I write this, not just as a justification for why I had a Tinder, or as a plea for reparations, but also to warn the populace. Don’t pretend like you are too good for Tinder. If you think you are, you probably just didn’t realize that you still have the app. 
And if you are going to download the app for investigative purposes, make sure to actually delete it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 21, 2014, at 2:34 p.m.
Haley A. Rue, a rising sophomore in Pforzheimer House, died on Friday while traveling in Germany, according to German press reports and an email to the College from Dean Rakesh Khurana.
According to the reports, Rue, 19, drowned after falling into a whirlpool at the bottom of a waterfall.
Rue was traveling in Europe as a researcher-writer for Let’s Go, a Harvard Student Agencies company that produces travel guides in print and online.
As a writer for Let’s Go, Rue had spent the summer traveling through Austria, Hungary, and Germany, documenting her trip on the agency’s blog and collecting information for future travel guides. According to a blog post dated July 16, Rue had recently spent time in Innsbruck, Austria.
Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, the associate director of publishing for Let’s Go, declined to comment on Rue’s death, citing the agency’s efforts to collect more information before issuing a statement.
Khurana, in his first email to the whole College community since assuming office July 1, wrote that “no words can truly express the sense of loss Haley's death brings.”
“Haley had an adventurous spirit, and loved to write and travel,” Khurana wrote. “Those who knew her marveled at her kindness.”
A native of Tacoma, Washington, Rue lived in Canaday Hall during her freshman year at Harvard. She was also a writer for The Crimson’s weekly arts magazine.
Prior to entering Harvard, Rue attended Mount Rainier Lutheran High School, where she played soccer and basketball, and ran track.
The Tacoma News Tribune reported that affiliates of Rue’s high school and her church, Our Savior Lutheran Church in Tacoma, held a prayer service on Sunday attended by several hundred people.

CORRECTION: July 21, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the day on which Rue died. In fact, it was Friday, July 18.
