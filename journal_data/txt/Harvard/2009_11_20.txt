After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just for kicks, imagine New York City, 1868: The bustling center of American culture abounded with theaters, P.T. Barnum-esque museums of curiosities, and the middle and upper classes whose sensibilities these entertainments are offended. British burlesque star Lydia Thompson and her sensual troupe, the British Blondes—short skirts and satirical skits in tow—stepped off their ship and into a foreign country teetering on the cultural waves of a nation in flux.
Though the Blondes dazzled the theatrical scene in their day, the descendents of what is now “classic burlesque” were soon relegated to the bottom rungs of tasteless, tassled, low brow entertainment, stripped of their creative liberties, and rather formulaically cast as realizations of male fantasy.
Over 140 years later, the creativity of burlesque has made a return farther up the coast in Boston, whose rich downtown theater district had, by the 1960s, devolved into “The Combat Zone”—a red light district of adult entertianment known for the sort of smutty striptease taht the world “burlesque” has been known to bring to mind. With the very popular holiday burlesque “The Slutcracker” now selling out shows at the Somerville Theatre and burlesque performances popping up around the area—increasingly with the support of the American Repertory Theatre’s Club Oberon—the comedic performance of strip tease is being revived to engage the short attention spans of a varied contemporary audience out more for social issues and sheer spectacle than simply flesh.
KICK START
“What does it mean to be a woman?” asks University of North Carolina professor Robert C. Allen, recounting the questions of gender that faced 19th century America. “What’s the nature of femininity?”
An historian of American Studies, Allen’s “Horrible Prettiness: Burlesque and American Culture” is one of the leading discussions on the history of 19th- and 20th-century leg shows and the spectacle of the body.
“As burlesque becomes a working class form, the rich, multi-dimensional nature of traditional burlesque—women performing satirical plays in rhinestone couplets... [and] dressing up as men—that begins to fall away,” Allen says, “and what you’re left with is the display of the sexualized female body in motion.”
By 1937, the original burlesque—with its masculine mockery, scandalously underdressed women, and working class reputation—fell out of favor.
“[Then-New York City mayor Fiorello H.] LaGuardia basically said, ‘You can’t call anything burlesque in New York,’” Allen explains. “And New York being the theatrical hub, burlesque really folds.”
Of course, perceived social stigma is less of a deterrent now. Those seeking a strip show head to gentlemen’s clubs, not theaters.
“If they’re going to go see titties, they’re going to go to a titty bar,” says Vanessa “Sugar Dish” White, the mastermind behind “The Slutcracker,” which opens Dec. 10. A classically trained ballerina for 20 years, White entered the burlesque scene after an injury ended her ballet career; her cleverly-titled 40-person production is the redirection of her creative vision for the performance of movement.
According to Allen, a contemporary emphasis on expression rather than on simply dollars and cents has helped revive what had become more a business than an art form in the 20th century, allowing performers more control of their routines.
White’s show, for example, which uses the original Tchaikovsky “Nutcracker” score, returns to some of the theatrical elements of early theater in a way that is unusually expressive. “[M]y dancers, instead of just being these images on the stage, [are] allowed to engage with audience,” White says. “...Wink at people, stick their tongue out.”
And though it might seem blasphemous to some to appropriate the classic performance for a more scantily clad cast, Oberon producer Randy Weiner, the director and creator of “The Donkey Show,” notes that the same cries were made about the transplantation of Shakespeare into street gang life when “West Side Story” first opened.
For a modern audience generally jaded by the sex on TV and detached as a result of technology, burlesque possesses interactive appeal even while maintaining creative finesse.
“Burlesque show is an unusual beast in that it’s neither a ballet—100% dance—or a play,” says Alex “Scratch” Newman, manager of the established burlesque troupe Boston Babydolls. “There’s dance elements to it and less of a plot. It’s a balancing act and it’s a skill to pull together a good burlesque show.”
Members of Harvard’s theatrical and dance communities are also aware of this, and have begun to take steps to bring burlesque into the mainstream and into the campus dance community. For example, classically trained ballerina Marin J. Orlosky ’07-’08, a dance associate at the Office for the Arts’ Dance Program—which supports student dance groups and offers classes—developed an interest in circus arts as a teenager, which inspired time off to perform in this non-traditional arena. Most recently, she performed as the aerialist in the Loeb Mainstage production, “Momentum.”
Working within both the classical and non-traditional dance communities, Orlosky supports the validity of burlesque’s performative artistic value, despite its display of bare chests and shoulders.
“[W]hat I’ve seen as more transgressive elements have been not so much the sexy part but more the character content,” Orlosky says, referring to one of the more hilarious acts that she’s seen, “I think a whole lot of people have more problems with dressing up as schoolgirls and then one of them being crucified with glitter.”
And though not all burlesque performances try to be as controversial in terms of subject material, the freedom that the art provides and the controversies inherent in its form are enough to have Weiner very enthusiastic.
“I think it’s so exciting that the A.R.T. is so supportive of this,” he says regarding upcoming burlesque performances and the current talks with area burlesque troupes to bring more to the theater. “I think it’s so exciting that Harvard is so supportive of this.”
RAISING A BROW
Amongst the oddities surrounding Shakespearen disco “The Donkey Show,” Club Oberon’s first production of the new season, was the breasts. There was nothing out of the ordinary about them in and of themselves, but what they represented, as they danced above and through the unusual nightclub-style audience protected by the gently flapping wings of their butterfly pasties, was a shift. The A.R.T. would be doing things a little bit differently this year.
Those pasties—stickers carefully placed over a topless woman’s nipples during some types of performances, typically burlesque—would not be the last to come through that theater space this year. On December 4, the Boston Babydolls will fill the space with “V for Vixen,” a U.S.O.-style burlesque tribute to the nation’s armed forces, and talks are in the works of bringing more of the art form to the space on Arrow Street.
“[W]hen you say burlesque, you think girls taking off their clothes, and it means so much more than that,” says Ari Barbanell, director of special projects for Club Oberon. “It’s about variety shows. It’s about comedy. It’s about music.”
And, to some extent, it’s about finding a venue willing to let a troupe perform. With a decades and decades long reputation as being simply a sort of smutty striptease, Boston burlesque troops sometimes lack the funds or the street credentials to secure venues or even their own space to rehearse. When the Boston Babydolls moved into a dance studio in Quincy over a year ago, they were greeted by suspicion and accusation; the City Councilor for their particular area of the town, Brian F. McNamee, compared their appearance to the beginnings of Boston’s erstwhile “Combat Zone.” “The Combat Zone started out with innocent burlesque,” the Boston Globe quoted McNamee in April, “and then the next thing you know, there’s striptease, prostitutes, drugs, and pimps.”
If “The Donkey Show” was any indication, this is not necessarily a crowd the Oberon staff is adverse to, even if they did believe that it’s the type a burlesque troupe would attract—which they don’t. By encouraging and inviting troupes to perform there, they hope that the high quality theater space and audio and lighting equipment will lend burlesque troupes not only the proper materials to create their spectacles but also some artistic legitimacy. And while “The Slutcracker” has had success at the Somerville Theatre, the performers in the show do not derive from one troupe, but many various ones, which on their own, do not have their own performance spaces.
“[‘The Slutcracker’] was fantastic and what they did that was so brilliant was put together all these troops... [but] the problem with Somerville Theater is that that’s not a home,” says Oberon producer Randy Weiner. “And what we’re try to give them a home.”
IT TAKES ALL KINDS
A motley crowd, contemporary burlesque troops vary locally and nationally in terms of content and approach.
“[T]here are a lot of different styles of burlesque, even in Boston,” says Mr. Scratch, the stage name for the manager of the Boston Babydolls. “Some of them are more nostalgic and some of them take classic burlesque as a jumping off point for a modern audience.”
And, as Professor Allen observed at the Burlesque Hall of Fame convention in Las Vegas last year, that modern message and that modern audience can take as many forms as the people composing it.
“[W]hat’s going on with burlesque today is really, really interesting... because it’s driven by women and it’s driven by performance and it’s going on on different levels in all kinds of different places,” he says. “Burlesque is tapping into a gay performance culture, it’s tapping into a male performance culture... a lesbian performance culture. It’s tapping into performance art... and pin-up culture. It’s going in a lot of different ways, but the anchor is that they revolve around the body, the performed body, and the sexuality around the performed body.”
But while it may seem as though an interest in burlesque suggests a degree of comfort with the exposed body, an ideological shift in attitude toward sex is unlikely.
“I think what is removed is an anxiety around a very specific presentation of sex,” says Eugene Tan, community engagement director of The Theater Offensive, which recently presented the 18th annual Queer Theater Festival, “Out on The Edge.” “I think a lot of burlesque is interested in a very polished version of sex and in that way it’s related to sex.”
The variety show format still allows, however, for a variety in reception, from the academic assessment of its cultural significance to the performative success; from the show’s intended political or social message to its raw entertainment value.
“What’s so cool about burlesque... is that you can take it anywhere,” Weiner says. “[Burlesque and variety shows] are just three minutes—like little poems—and you can interpret it however you want.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is not surprising that Stephen Sondheim, arguably the most influential living Broadway composer and lyricist, knows how to work an audience. Last Saturday night, he received a standing ovation as he walked into a packed Sanders Theatre to present “An Evening with Stephen Sondheim: An Onstage Conversation with Frank Rich,” an event organized by the Celebrity Series of Boston.
Frank H. Rich ’71, currently a New York Times columnist and formerly their chief theater critic, first met Sondheim after writing a Harvard Crimson review of “Follies,” a Boston production for which Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics.
Upon reading the review, Sondheim contacted him requesting a meeting. Sondheim was impressed by the article, not because of its positive assessment, but because of how adeptly Rich had understood the play. During Saturday night’s onstage conversation, Sondheim stressed that in theater it is supremely important that the audience understand and connect with the material.
“The audience is your collaborator. There is another character in the room, and you have to consider that. It’s not about pandering, it’s about clarity,” he said. “If they’re not liking it because they don’t understand it, that is a theatrical sin.”
Despite his extraordinarily successful career, the composer has still received his fair share of hostile reviews. Rich recalled attending a Washington production of Sondheim’s musical “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum” that had garnered such bad press that, he said, “My parents almost considered not letting me use my ticket.”
Sondheim’s mentor Oscar Hammerstein II, believed that the first musical number is the most important of a production, as it sets up the plot and informs the audience of what to expect from the rest of the show; the major flaw with “Forum,” according to Sondheim, was the mood set by the opening number, a song called “Love is in the Air.”
At the time, “Forum” director Jerome Robbins, a frequent collaborator, offered a reason for the negative responses to the musical. “When Robbins came in, he said ‘You’re not telling the audience that this is a low comedy; you’re telling them that it’s a charming show,’” Sondheim recalled. When Sondheim replaced “Love is in the Air” with a new song, “Comedy Tonight,” there was an almost instant change in the show’s reception. “Comedy Tonight” is a farcical number that prepares the audience for what Sondheim described as “low comedy presented in an elegant way.”
What sets the mood for a theater audience, however, does not necessarily translate to film. A self-professed “film buff,” Sondheim said that the only onscreen version of a musical he has ever enjoyed as a film in its own right is Tim Burton’s 2007 “Sweeney Todd,” for which he wrote the music. Although some Sondheim fans were disappointed that Burton cut the recurring chorus, “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,” the composer said he approved of the choice; in his opinion, choruses in musicals, during which nonessential background characters suddenly join the leads in song, have a “peasant on the green mentality”; his technique is ineffective in films, where the focus lies more on dramatizing interior emotions than creating theatrical spectacle.
In particular, Sondheim is known for writing songs for characters in the midst of a personal crisis. “I love to write nervous breakdown songs,” he said. “I understand them so well.” The number “Epiphany” in “Sweeney Todd,” for example, marks the turning point of the show, when Todd transforms from a tragic hero into a man thirsty for blood and vengeance. The success of this particular number is crucial, because it has to justify this character’s transformation.
A notoriously bloody tale about cannibalism, “Sweeney Todd” ran to overwhelming success in the United States, where it first opened. “I used to watch the audience’s faces as they were watching Sweeney Todd singing this lovely little love song and slitting people’s throats,” Sondheim said. “They were mesmerized. They weren’t turned off. They were turned on.”
But as what works for theater may not work for film, what works for one particular audience may not work for another; a version of “Sweeney Todd” identical to the original US production flopped in England.
“I wouldn’t say they hated it,” Sondheim said. “They just thought we were idiots.” In England, the character of Sweeney Todd is often thrown around as an empty threat to scare disobedient children. Consequently, English audiences viewed Sondheim’s play as seriously as Americans might regard a musical about the Boogie Man. Nevertheless, the hostile reception still stung.
“It was a double hurt to me because I’d become an Anglophile, and this was my love letter to England,” Sondheim said.
Even through the challenges brought on by negative reviews, Sondheim has maintained his love of the creative process. In “Sunday in the Park with George,” the song “Finishing the Hat” is his ode to the delight of creation; he writes, “However you live / there’s a part of you always standing by / mapping out the sky / finishing a hat... Look, I made a hat / where there never was a hat.”
“It is such a privilege to be a creative artist and to get yourself into a country that not many people are able to get into,” Sondheim said, referring to the creative domain exclusive to artists. “I wanted the song to show the vulnerability of someone who is making his own world.”

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro’s rise to power, a period of drastic cultural and political change in the island nation’s history. Marking this occasion, The Boston Printmakers, an artists’ association at Emmanuel College, are presenting an exhibition titled “Making Connections: Contemporary Cuban Printmakers.” Since early October and continuing through Sunday at The Laconia Gallery in Boston, the exhibition showcases prints by over 90 contemporary Cuban artists.
Though a few of the featured artists live in the United States, most of them still reside in Cuba. Cuban artists lack the exposure of many other artists because they cannot ship their pieces into the United States due to the business, travel, and financial restrictions that result from the embargo enacted during the Kennedy era. Many of the pieces on display could only enter the country accompanied by someone returning from Cuba.
“They’re wonderful artists,” explains one of the exhibition’s curators, Marjorie Javan. “It’s a tiny little island and the amount of artistic energy is unbelievable.” Though nearly all of the artists have had formal training (according to Javan, “Maybe a handful are self-taught”) many have to contend with a severe lack of artistic supplies and, therefore, must improvise. Once Cuba lost the financial support of the Soviet Union, according to Javan, some artists were forced to use kitchen linoleum for the lack of printing material more suited to artistic purposes. These multifaceted artists display talents in a wide array of media including etchings, woodcuts, and lithographs. “They all seem to do a little bit of everything,” Javan notes.
Pieces in the exhibit offer perspectives on pain, escape, truth, or humor. One print, Sandra Ramos’ “The Damned Circumstances of Water Everywhere,” depicts a near-naked woman lounging in a shape identical to the island nation. The piece depicts the close connection between the artists and their homeland as well as, the title implies, the isolation that some of the country’s artists might feel. Another of the exhibition’s pieces, Belkis Ayon’s “Resurrection,” shows a head with only two piercing eyes and an “X” covering the mouth, reflecting the stifled and stifling environment in which many of these artists live.
Javan believes that the exhibition has been very successful, noting in particular how college students have reacted to the pieces: “Some [Boston University] students who came to the show said, ‘You know, that show really taught us something.’” She speculates that the potency of the exhibit stems from its directness. “It inspires as to what else you can do with printmaking,” she says. The exhibition’s exploration of the nature of life in Cuba today also helps lend it educational value.
The exhibition has an important ability to inform the Boston area about lesser-known artists who have little opportunity or ability to publicize themselves. Additionally, Javan says, “Something like this isn’t going to come around for a while,” again citing restrictions on Cuban artists’ mobility and ability to introduce their artwork into America. “Making Connections: Contemporary Cuban Printmakers” offers an opportunity to engage with a culture that rarely gets publicized in America from a new perspective. “We’re bringing exposure to these wonderful artists. Boston is an international community,” Javan says. “It’s important for the art community to see what goes on outside their borders.”

Ryu Goto ’11, brother of renowned violinist Midori Goto, will join the Bach Society Orchestra (BachSoc) this Sunday in a concert featuring the music of Strauss, Mendelssohn, and Brahms. Goto will solo in Brahms’ Violin Concerto. Touted by conductor Lorin Maazel as one of the finest young performers today, Goto has toured internationally over the past several years, playing with the London Symphony, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, the Shanghai Philharmonic, and the National Symphony in Washington, D.C. This semester, Goto has performed in Kansas, San Francisco, and Mexico City.
The Harvard Crimson: Why did you decide to go to Harvard? Did you consider studying at a conservatory?
Ryu Goto: I went to an unspecialized private school in New York, and I got to do a lot of things and have a wide perspective. But I had been to Julliard Pre-College for two years, and I saw the kind of difficulty [my friends] had to go through psychologically. In a conservatory, there’s only one way in and one way out, and that crushes a lot of people. Some are able to pull it off—to go through that tunnel by sheer willpower and talent and emerge as a giant in the field. But for every one that succeeds, there are thousands that fail. My parents understood the kinds of doubts and anxiety of having only one focus. Having come here, I decided not to concentrate in music under any circumstances, as a kind of personal policy.
THC: Do you notice a difference in the playing or attitude of American, European, and Asian orchestras?
RG: Asian orchestras tend to be more methodical, but at the same time, a little heavy-handed. They have the relatively meticulous, engineered quality you might expect. American orchestras are much more relaxed.
European orchestras tend to be opinionated—German orchestras especially. Playing the Brahms concerto in Germany—Brahms’ homeland—was a challenge for me because I am Japanese-American and have a heritage that has nothing to do with Germanic or Austrian music. But I could immediately tell [the music I was playing] just fit there. It was just natural for the audience and the orchestra. It was the same playing a Paganini Concerto with an Italian orchestra and Lorin Maazel. I felt like I was just playing by myself because they were so put together.
THC: Why do you think music from a certain country is often more suitable for orchestras native to that country?
RG: It’s cultural, social; it has to do with social mentality. It could be anything from language to just the way each person’s education in the larger sense has shaped their minds and their sensibility. When I listen on the radio I can almost always tell if someone’s European, Asian, or American—American’s a little harder; if it’s a guy or a girl playing. Once you become somewhat proficient at any endeavor, simply by looking at a work in your field, you can tell who’s doing it and that person’s general mentality.
THC: Why perform with BachSoc?
RG: I get the feeling that BachSoc is bound by camaraderie, not by didactic force. Everyone teaches and learns at the same time. Of course Yuga [J. Cohler ’11, music director] is a leader, but he’s very receptive to the feedback of the others. People are there not to compete but to experiment and to explore the boundaries of their musicality. They’re always striving to improve themselves under their own terms. Alan Gilbert [’89], the new conductor of the New York Philharmonic, is a family friend, and he conducted BachSoc. He and other alumni have said it was incredibly enriching. I’ll continue to play with them as long as they’ll have me. If I had time I’d try to be a member myself.
THC: Why perform Brahms’ concerto?
RG: The Brahms is my favorite. It’s a very satisfying piece. It has so much depth—partly due to Brahms’ genius, of course, but also due to the fact that he put so much work into it. He revised and proofread every work for a period of years—sometimes decades. There are no flaws in it. It’s a hard piece to play, too—you can’t wing it.
THC: Do you have any future plans for playing violin as a career?
RG: I have no idea. I’m just not really an ambitious guy. I love playing the violin, but I just don’t know how my sister made it there, with such a measure of self-discipline. I want to keep on doing music for the rest of my life… But there are other things I want to do.
THC: Do you prefer playing solo or in a chamber group?
RG: I love chamber music. I’m playing chamber music right now, and I want to have a band someday. I play the guitar here. They’re both satisfying, but with solo playing, you’re just the boss. I sound like a douche saying that, but it’s an opportunity for you to lead—to be an inspiration.

“Clouds of sulfur in the air / Bombs are falling everywhere / It’s heartbreak warfare,” sings John Mayer on “Heartbreak Warfare,” the opener on his fourth studio album, “Battle Studies.” With dark lyrics that may at first seem unsettling to those accustomed to Mayer’s usually relaxed tone, violent imagery is quite pervasive on “Battle Studies,” signaling a new direction for the popular singer-songwriter. On earlier releases, Mayer sounds confused but contented, extolling the virtues of young adulthood while simultaneously wallowing in the pitfalls of a quarter-life crisis. On his newest effort, Mayer sounds far more heartsick and forlorn than in his earlier career; however, he spins his grief into melodic gold, putting forth excellent songwriting and poignant lyrics that result in his best album since his 2001 debut “Room for Squares.”
Mayer has always had a clever tongue and keen wit, noticing the idiosyncrasies and quirks of romantic relationships (see 2001’s “My Stupid Mouth”) and the tracks on “Battle Studies” continue to showcase this talent. The album’s best lyrical phrase comes on the bluesy closer “Friends, Lovers Or Nothing,” as Mayer repeats the refrain, “Anything other than yes is no / Anything other than stay is go / Anything less than ‘I love you’ is lying.” On “Assassin,” Mayer compares his failing relationship to a “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” dynamic, singing, “I was a killer / Was the best they’d ever seen / I’d steal your heart / Before you ever heard a thing / I’m an assassin and I had a job to do / Little did I know that girl was an assassin too.” Mayer’s knack for dissecting the nuances of relationships ultimately make his narratives far more captivating this time around.
Yet, though his observations of love’s difficulties may inspire a chuckle from the listener, the lyrics on “Battle Studies” prove much darker and more dramatic than those in his previous efforts. While Mayer has always touched heavily upon heartbreak in his songs, “Battle Studies” arrives on the heels of a very public romance with Jennifer Aniston and a raised celebrity profile. He implements a much more pensive, gloomy tone on this album, aiming to speak from the heart rather than the tabloids. Instead of father-daughter relationships and inescapable forces of nature, he sings of bombs, killers, and arson, all of which serve as metaphors for his lovelorn misadventures.
On “Battle Studies,” Mayer no longer sports the sheepish grin and earnest tone that brought humor to otherwise disheartening songs like the 2001 hit “Why Georgia.” On “War of My Life,” he mourns, “I’m in the war of my life / I’m at the core of my life / Got no choice but to fight till it’s done.” With his new set, Mayer digs deeper into his own soul to expose his own romantic and moral faults. He continues to show his destructive streak on “Edge of Desire,” singing, “Don’t say a word / Just come on and lie here with me / ‘Cause I’m just about to set fire / To everything I see.” No longer a lovably lost post-grad, he has become an introspective adult, and though his tone may be prove less light-hearted, it ultimately makes for more compelling songwriting.
Musically, the album does not break a tremendous amount of new ground, but rather smoothes and refines the sound Mayer has developed over the past few years. The eleven tracks strike a pleasing balance between the acoustic pop of “Room for Squares” and the electric blues-rock throwback of 2006’s “Continuum.” The gorgeous “All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye,” with its simple guitar strumming, melancholy strings, and stunning vocal harmonies, is the album’s clear standout, sounding like the best ’70s soft rock gem never written. “Do You Know Me” and “Half Of My Heart,” a duet with country-pop it-girl Taylor Swift, surround guitar melodies with light atmospherics and layered vocals, while “Friends, Lovers Or Nothing,” “Perfectly Lonely,” and the admittedly out-of-place cover of Robert Johnson-by-way-of-Cream’s “Crossroads” indulge Mayer’s recent blues-rock tendencies with cascades of electric guitar and hard piano chords.
Mayer does experiment with a few new sounds, but not enough to take him into uncharted territory. “Heartbreak Warfare” features a trippy, electronic groove under light electric guitar notes while “Assassin” incorporates tropical chimes. Fortunately, Mayer’s songwriting is already pleasing enough that he does not have to tinker with his sound in order for “Battle Studies” to be a solid release.
“Battle Studies” proves that Mayer has left behind the heartthrob crooning of “Your Body is a Wonderland.” His new album tackles far more serious, personal issues, and as aresult, he has produced some of the best tracks of his career. Ultimately, the tone behind Mayer’s songwriting can be summed up by a lyric on the first single, “Who Says,” on which he sings, “I can’t remember / You looking any better / But then again I don’t remember you.” Combining a wry sense of irony with a sense of heartbroken anguish, Mayer conveys beauty found in romantic confusion.

Few musicians as successful as rap legend 50 Cent have ever been less innovative.  Indeed, 50 has gained enormous and well-deserved fame by creating the archetypal song for many of hip-hop’s most fundamental clichés—in his 2003 masterpiece “Get Rich or Die Tryin’” alone, 50 brought the dance floor bump-n-grind to its apotheosis with “In Da Club,” painted the precise portrait of one of rap’s cardinal tropes with “P.I.M.P.,” and refined hip-hop’s coarse, lascivious love ballad with “21 Questions.” These songs are just part of a larger collection of singles that have formed 50’s success by imprinting combinations of catchy, uncomplicated hooks and evenly-paced, slick, alternatively gritty and playful beats onto rap’s collective consciousness.
50’s newest album, “Before I Self Destruct,” reveals the shortcomings of this formula.  As before, the album is limited to the rap’s essential subjects: self-promotion, industry feuding, and street cred.  This newest release also resembles 50’s past success in its stellar production and moments of great lyrical intensity. But “Before I Self Destruct” is limited by its combination of forgettable hooks, tired themes and unfocused narratives.
Nonetheless, 50 does make an effort at trying something new.  The album’s lead single, “Baby by Me,” is a nod at the new synth-laden, auto-tuned electronic-rap that currently is dominating the hip-hop charts.  A fast-talking Fiddy avoids subtlety, giddily rapping “Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire” and “you can feel every inch of it when we intimate / I’ll use my tongue baby, I’ll leave you sprung baby.”  R&B star Ne-Yo contributes to the blithe fun in the song’s hook, explaining in his most sincere croon, “bet I’ll have you gone,” and, with a quick-paced, commanding tone, and repeatedly implores, “come see what I mean.”  Despite a lack of originality, the song’s bubbly pop sound and frivolous air make it radio-ready and a virtually guaranteed hit on the dance floor.
Some of 50’s more traditional songs are also strong, and a few even grasp at the greatness of his earlier work.  “Psycho,” the newest installment in a series of Eminem-50 Cent duets that have appeared on each of 50’s albums, is one of the best songs the two MC’s have made together.  One of three Dr. Dre-produced songs on the album, “Psycho” has a slow-moving and tense beat that is punctuated by a sweeping, dramatic string sample.  50 returns to his most successful gangsta style in lines like, “it’s murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistics / but they can’t find a fingerprint this shit’s going terrific.”
But Eminem surpasses this already fine performance, exhibiting his wide creative range and superior rhyming ability.  Combining a series of pop-culture figures that includes the Octomom, Dakota Fanning, Christopher Reeves, and Portia de Rossi into a shocking and fantastic narrative, Shady explains “I’m as ill as can be / my appeal is to serial killers, what a pill is to me / killing so villainously / still as maniacal on the Nyquil and psycho as Michael Myers.”  The connection between Eminem’s thoughts on B-list celebrities and 50’s threats of murder, however, is barely logical.  Indeed, like most of “Before I Self Destruct,” “Psycho” is a song that is as violent as it is vague.
“Crime Wave,” “Death to My Enemies,” and “Stretch” all follow this bland, angry model of songs about death and drugs.  Lines that share rhymes, images, and cadences begin to appear throughout these songs, as in “Crime Wave” and “Stretch” when 50 respectively says “Pistol pop, dime for dime, burn baby burn” and “Gun pop!  One shot! Body drop, it wasn’t me!”  All three of these songs concern 50’s recklessness, violence, and drug history, and end up cheapening some of the better songs on the album by creating a sense of tedium.
The most significant failures on “Before I Self Destruct” are in the loss of the simple, catchy hooks that played a crucial role in vaulting 50 to his present position in hip-hop.  Particularly poor showings can be seen in “Then Days Went By,” when 50 rhymes “rich,” “shit,” “hit,” and “shit,” or in that of “Could’ve Been You,” when R. Kelly explains to a potential mate that, “The reason you didn’t get picked / because you got your nose up your ass / You smelling your shit / but tonight you met your match / I’m smelling my shit too now how you like that.” R. Kelly’s humor is infantile without being fun and contrasts terribly with the rest of “Could’ve Been You,” an unforgiving song about lost love.
“Before I Self Destruct” feels like 50 Cent’s attempt to reassert his street roots and to assure listeners that, despite being a musical and corporate icon, Fiddy has not grown soft.  In the trash talking, self-promotion, and muscle flexing that ensues, 50 provides for entertainment, if not intrigue.  This basic enjoyment, however, runs shallow: having come to define many of rap’s most important symbols, 50 Cent has started to run in place.

There are a number of flannel-wearing, facial-hair-sporting folk who took a cursory glance at the album cover of “Don’t Stop,” its subject replete with neon lettering and flawlessly coiffed ’80s hair, and dismissed it without a second thought. But while the music the album contains has a lot in common with the 1980s-throwback synthpop those people believed they were tossing aside, it also does not deserve such a careless dismissal.
Norwegian electropopper Annie released her debut album, “Anniemal,” to a wave of critical adoration back in 2004, and 5 years later it still garners praise. That album’s second single—a giddy, entrancing pop anthemcalled “Heartbeat”—celebrates the carefree joy of the dancefloor as effectively as any of the endless parade of disco songs on the subject. The rest of “Anniemal” almost lived up to that track: the angular, percussive “Chewing Gum” and funk-tinged “No Easy Love” proved highlights for an album that provided pop hooks from beginning to end and easily outclassed an entire year’s worth of material from American divas.
Five years later, Annie returns with “Don’t Stop,” an album that’s been plagued by repeated delays and tracklist changes. “I Know UR Girlfriend Hates Me,” which was originally in the running to be the first single of the album, has since been relegated to a bonus disc (not such a tragedy, since it features a throbbing bassline and perfectly breathy vocals and still manages to be vaguely annoying).  More inexplicably discarded is “Anthonio,” a trance-y, absorbing elegy to lost love.
What remains are 12 songs which range in topic from love to... well, love. This is a pop album, after all. And though the themes are less than original, the music is very much Annie’s own. Annie dubbed her debut album “pop with strange edges,” a description that quickly caught on in the press. While her influences have changed slightly on “Don’t Stop,” that moniker still applies.
“Hey Annie,” the opener, does not begin promisingly. With bass-heavy, Timbaland-esque beats, the first 60 seconds of the once-idiosyncratic Annie’s sophomore effort threaten to descend into Top 40 monotony. The track redeems itself, though, by quickly leaving the beats behind in favor of a dreamily beautiful electronic vibe.
Once again, Annie turns to her universal metaphor: dancing. In “Heartbeat,” the movements were nostalgic even as they happened—a perfect moment, never to be experienced again. Here, dancing’s role is the more traditional one of a courtship ritual: “If we put our hands together / Yeah, we’re all here for the better / In the music you might discover / And your pulse and your beat and your laugh.” The second track, “My Love is Better,” steps up the pace and the attitude; a catty putdown to a romantic competitor set to powerful, pulsating synths. “My kiss is wetter (Than your kiss) / My lips are better (Than your tricks) / You know you never (Had my hips) / I’m so much better (So eat this),” she sneers—and you can’t help but lap it up.
Annie does slip up occasionally. “The Breakfast Song” is a gimmicky track with lyrics as ridiculous as they are irrelevant (“What do you want… what do you want for breakfast?”). Annie’s ghostly natural tone, elsewhere used to brilliant effect, is discarded in favor of a punkish yowling that doesn’t suit her in the slightest.
“Heaven and Hell” also disappoints. A bouncy, whimsical number that recalls the lighter edges of 1990s indie pop, it also brandishes that genre’s worst impulses: childishness and condescension. The result is more than a little irritating, and closes the album on a distinctly sour note.
But aside from these exceptions, “Don’t Stop” provides pitch-perfect tunes that never feel formulaic, though album highlight “Songs Remind Me of You” is the only song on “Don’t Stop” that approaches the sheer euphoria of “Heartbeat.” Despite the melancholy lyrical theme—“Every song I hear reminds me of you / Doesn’t make me feel the same as I do”—the beguiling, compulsively danceable chorus brushes tantalizingly near to pop perfection.
The echoing synth lines and breathy vocals throughout prove that Annie isn’t ashamed of her distinctly ’80s-throwback sound. Instead, she triumphantly embraces it—from hairstyle  ondown. And with music this striking and a vocalist this endearing, the kitsch is nearly irresistible. Among a slew of recent ’80s pop revivalists, Annie simply does it better than the rest.
“Don’t Stop” is lacking a signature single. There’s no “Heartbeat” here; there’s barely even a “Chewing Gum.” But it makes up for the absence of immediate standouts by consistently delivering the goods: there are more hooks on this album than some pop artists deliver in a lifetime. From the disco minimalism of the title track to the spaced-out lustfulness of “Take You Home,” this is electropop as it should be—and rarely ever is.

Them Crooked Vultures are a bona fide supergroup. Consisting of Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age), Dave Grohl (Nirvana and Foo Fighters), and John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin), they form a formidable lineup of rock’s elder statesmen both past and present. Despite the impressive breadth of the band’s talent, however, it is Homme who controls the group. Dominated by aggressive and fast-paced hard rock, the band’s self-titled debut feels very much like a continuation of Homme’s prolific career, and that is precisely why it is such a triumph.
Homme’s Queens of the Stone Age, once viewed as the band who would save hard rock in the 21st Century, have continued to produce impressive albums. His other projects, from leading the satirical Eagles of Death Metal to producing the most recent Arctic Monkeys album, have all sought to bring out the dark side of rock music. Grohl, meanwhile, has never managed to reattain the heights he reached in the early 90s with grunge legends Nirvana, contenting himself with creating Foo Fighters’ radio-friendly rock. Grohl’s greatest success this decade may have been the superb drumming he contributed to QOTSA’s 2002 album, “Songs for the Deaf,” and his new collaboration with Homme sees him return to this role. Jones, meanwhile has released a few solo albums to little recognition, while also collaborating with many artists, including joining  Homme in appearing on acoustic tracks for Foo Fighters’ 2005 LP, “In Your Honor.”
Any thought that the trio would continue to dabble in acoustic collaborations is very quickly disproved on the band’s debut. Opener “No One Loves Me & Neither Do I” sees its guitars set about slowly and heavily crushing what melody there is. Proceeding at a restrained pace for a while before shifting into an incredible stomp for its final two minutes, the unrelenting assault of the opener proves that TCV have no intention of making shiny guitar rock like Foo Fighters or the classic heavy metal of Led Zeppelin. This is very much QOTSA-style, furiously aggressive hard rock.
This style is most apparent on seven-minute highlight, “Elephants.” The song opens with ninety seconds of guitar assault and screeching riffs. Even after the vocals enter, the attack continues but, extraordinarily, it softens into a couple of beautifully melodic passages. These are short in duration, but they lend a fascinating depth to the song. The lyrics humorously complement the song’s inability to settle on one mood, Homme singing, “No I can never stay melancholy for long,” then snarling as the guitars return, “Before I move on.”
The aggression of TCV’s music does not mean that the album lacks its accessible moments. The album front-loads its two catchiest songs immediately after the opener. “Mind Eraser, No Chaser” features vocals by both Grohl and Homme, although this serves only to reiterate the superiority of the latter. Grohl’s over-enthusiastic and humorless singing pales by comparison with Homme’s sophisticated sneer, and fortunately most of the album sees Grohl consigned to his natural place, behind the drum kit, providing successfully muscular, if surpisingly understated, beats. The other clear choice for a single, “New Fang,” tells a typical rock story of youthful indulgence and masculine indiscretions—“Sometimes you break a finger on the other hand / Think you got me confused for a better man.” Set to a relatively jaunty riff, the song shows the album is willing to compromise a little in the way of accessibility while still retaining its hard rock edge.
Aside from these highlights, the quality of most of the songs is consistent, even if they are less essential. Late album cuts like “Caligulove” and especially the danceable “Gunman” successfully channel the album’s aggressive spirit into well-crafted tracks. However, the album’s biggest weakness is the band’s tendency towards indulging themselves a little too much. Containing three songs close to or longer than seven minutes, and at over an hour of consistently hard and loud rock music, the album can get a little tiring. The appropriately titled “Interlude with Ludes” is a particularly wasteful use of four minutes, while closer “Spinning in Daffodils” is over-extended after its beautiful piano intro by Jones. Like Grohl’s drumming, Jones’s bass contributions are not highlighted and he seems a little overshadowed by his illustrious bandmates. Despite these issues, “Them Crooked Vultures” is an undoubtedly successful debut for the supergroup. In fact, this is the most essential any of the three members have sounded in years. With Jones restored to prominence thirty years after his career high, Grohl returning to the hard rock his drumming talents are suited for rather than the classic rock sheen of Foo Fighters, and Homme freed from the pressure and expectations of Queens of the Stone Age, it sounds like all three are truly enjoying themselves. While it is Homme’s influence that dominates the record, what really sticks in the mind is how brilliant an idea TCV is, and how all three members—and their fans—would benefit from them making more records very much like this one.

If Norah Jones’ voice were perfect—if she always used the same silky smooth tone she so effortlessly commands—she might be boring. But fortunately, every so often the singer slips into something more comfortable—a coarse and breathy style—just to remind us that she is as down-to-earth as her lyrics imply. From great stylistic and emotional range, her voice derives a unique charm.
Thus it is entirely baffling why, on so many of the tracks on her latest album “The Fall,” Jones denies her voice the limelight. In the process of musical experimentation, she appears to have forgotten her greatest strengths as an artist. In the past, Jones found her home in the sultry intersection of country and jazz, but unfortunately her first forays into the realm of rock meet with varied success on “The Fall,” where at certain points she completely drowns her silken voice in awkwardly abrasive electronic chords.
In the past, Jones has showcased her jazzy vocals over simple accompaniments. On “Come Away With Me,” winner of the 2003 Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album, and 2005 Grammy nominee “Feels Like Home,” she masterfully combined minimalist keyboard and guitar work with pensive lyrics and lilting melodies. To a certain extent, the singer-songwriter continues in this vein on her latest album.
The sweet and melancholic tension of “Waiting,” for example, comes through in some persistent guitar chords and a little tinkling on the piano. Jones’ signature hum returns, too, as she thinks to herself: “If I wait, it doesn’t mean you will return.” “December,” too, radiates warmth like a Christmas carol; Jones’ comforting humanity radiates through the song in her more earthen style.
These pieces are all the more welcome, however, in light of the more uncomfortable tracks on the album. “It’s Gonna Be” sounds like a retrospective attempt at the very worst type of classic rock, including repetitive lyrics, insipid rhymes and lack of chord progression. “If all we talk about is money nothing will be funny, honey,” Jones warbles. Nothing of the singer’s nuanced vocals can be distinguished over the heavy-handed electric undercurrent.
Likewise, the corrosive twangs behind “I Wouldn’t Need You” overpower its vocals. In this particular ill-advised attempt to create a fusion of rock and jazz—platitudes thrown somewhat haphazardly over an oddly insistent and plodding background—Jones incorporates several upsetting and nonsensical chords at the song’s climax.
Still, when she more carefully considers the effect of synthetic chords on her generally soft melodies, Jones puts the electric guitar to better use. The leadoff track, “Chasing Pirates,” uses a repeated electric tag and a harsher drumbeat to emphasize the claustrophobic redundancy of circular thoughts and dreams. “And I try not to dream but them possible schemes swim around / wanna drown me in synch,” she sings. Somehow, too, “Back to Manhattan” sounds like pure jazz—like Jones at her best way back when—while also incorporating the wistful moan of an electric guitar. The song seems to resonate in a void, as Jones admits “I know nothing ’bout leaving but I know I should do it today.”
“Young Blood” also stands out as an example of a successful experiment; Jones balances heavier electronics with a simple drumbeat. The powerful melody, hearkening back to the best of U2 or Coldplay, is  refreshing for a jazz vocalist, but it’s hard not to wonder if Jones could do the song better in her own acoustic way. The same goes for “Light as a Feather,” which comes off as a compelling tune with a worrying background whine.
It would be unfair, however, to say that Jones has not undergone any developments since the relatively dry and disappointing “Not Too Late” (2007). Back then, the artist’s hackneyed attempts at political humor left something to be desired. But Jones’ own brand of humor shines through on “The Fall” more than any other album. In “Tell Yer Mama,” she coolly exhorts an ex-lover to “tell your mama I said hello, / that she raised you—[pause]—too damn slow.” She remains deliciously calm throughout the bitter piece. Similarly, in “Man of the Hour,” she expresses shock that she may actually settle with one man for even just an hour—after overcoming the feeling that she “can’t choose between a vegan and a pothead.”
“The Fall” can be seen as a kind of cautionary tale. The singer-songwriter may not be cut out for rock ballads, and her voice does not integrate well with overeager electronics and heavy drumbeats. But she has her vocal powers and lyrical allure of years past and this album reminds us that she can still persuade listeners to come away with her.

Eating is as universal and timeless a human experience as exists. Food has always been much more than just sustenance. Throughout human history and across the full range of human cultures, food has always been not just a vital necessity and visceral pleasure, but a social unifier and a cultural signifier. Food is art, and like literature, film, and painting, cuisine is created and evolves through dialogue; it is handed down and built upon almost like an oral epic. Each dish and ingredient tells a complex and continuing story about the people that produced it. What reaches our tables today expresses the ingenuity, love, and dedication not only of those in our modern kitchens, but those who first picked a suspicious looking morel mushroom or first decided to throw a disconcertingly hideous monkfish in a pan.
Using a rare parental visit as an excuse to venture outside the usual Square culinary offerings of burritos, pizza, and more burritos, I recently found myself at Tupelo, a Cajun restaurant near Inman Square which wholeheartedly embraces the varied cultural elements of its cuisine.
Cajun cuisine is at the core of a culture defined primarily by its mixed identity. The term itself is a deformation of “Acadien,” originally used to define the French Canadian colonizers of the bayous of lower Louisiana, but which has now come to apply to the diverse population throughout the region. These people are one of many unique segments of American immigrant societies—poor, subjugated, and concentrated into local majorities—that incubated and grew a coherent cultural and artistic style. The culture has produced Zydeco music, its own French dialect, a vibrant social culture with a penchant for raucous festivities, and an incredibly flavorful cuisine which reflects the rich boldness, economic poverty and diversity of the culture that created it.
We started the meal with fried oysters and remoulade (tartar sauce’s more interesting cousin, an aioli-based condiment usually flavored with pickles, chili, a touch of curry powder, and other ingredients particular to each chef). Fried oysters are classic Cajun fare, using a mollusk loved by the French but, at the time of the dish’s creation, inexpensive and largely overlooked in the United States. Tossed in a thin, crunchy batter and deep-fried, the juicy oysters, drenched in tangy remoulade, burst with flavor and steam heavily when they split open. Tupelo’s were, in our friendly and earnest waiter’s humble opinion, the best in the Boston area. Despite limited experience with Boston’s fried oysters, I’m inclined to agree with him.
Fried catfish and a rich gumbo, even more directly communicative of the history of the culture that created them, followed. Catfish—a dirt cheap, bottom-feeding fish generally looked down upon by most cuisines—is a Cajun favorite. Moist, tender, and succulent, the fish can hold its own against the nearly overpowering ingredients ubiquitous in Cajun cooking. Cajun catfish is often served “blackened”—lightly battered with a potent mix of garlic, cornmeal, flour, cumin, generous amounts of chili, and other spices—and pan fried until the spices have bubbled to a deep golden brown and let off a resinous, intoxicating steam. The one we ordered was remarkably delicate, lightly caked with tangy spices, and bedded on a creamy pool of thick, salty, utterly satisfying cheddar grits.
The gumbo, a New Orleans staple, was one of the best I’ve had. Gumbo is about as clear an expression of its cultural roots as food gets. The dish is an almost magical transformation of an impressive number of cheap ingredients into a potent, dirty reddish-green witches’ brew. Composed largely of throwaways from other dished, it’s about as good as a soup can get. To make a gumbo, you start with the roux, a classic French soup base which is used as one of the soup’s two main thickeners. It’s formed by nothing other than flour and butter, burnt together in a large stockpot until it bubbles golden and then rich dark brown, its flavor maturing into a sweet, nutty richness neither of the ingredients alone suggests. Nearly all gumbos have tomatoes, chicken, rice, sausage, and red pepper flakes, and are thickened by okra. Okra is a small, green squash-like vegetable whose sappy secretion transforms gumbo from a thick stew to something halfway towards gelatinous. The sausages, Cajun Andouille sausages, derived from the far milder French Lyonnaise pigs’ intestine sausages of the same name, combine pork offal and piles of spices into a dark red, incredibly rich and flavorful ingredient that gives gumbo the bulk of its flavor. Tupelo’s Andouilles, and, by extension, their gumbo—like everything else we ate there—was spot on.
Beyond the food, Tupelo, as a restaurant, embraces the entirety of its cuisine’s cultural heritage. Zydeco and folk played over the bustle of the restaurant, where colorful southern cityscapes adorned the walls, and playful glass chandeliers hung over the bar. A sort of cozy hominess oozes from the warmly shining copper tables and the mason jars the restaurant uses as water cups. Named for a city in Mississippi (or the tree that gave it its name, or the mild and thin honey made from these trees indigenous to mostly southern states) Tupelo is a restaurant that plunges you for an hour or two into the fun and vibrant atmosphere of a culture with a cuisine that doesn’t mess around.

Fred Ho ’79—baritone saxophonist, composer, band leader, political activist, and Marxist—is a pretty remarkable guy. He aspires to create multicultural and deeply political music by blending avant-garde jazz and African American music with Asian influences, and he actively fuses his roles as an artist and political activist to create a uniquely expressive identity for himself. Last Friday, Ho was honored with the Fall 2009 Harvard Arts Medal, which is awarded by the Office for the Arts to an alumni “who has made a special contribution to the good of the arts, to the public good in relation to the arts, or to education”; on the following evening, Ho played with the Harvard Monday Jazz Band in Lowell Lecture Hall for a premiere performance of his new work “Take the Zen Train.”
Since his beginnings as a self-taught musician, Ho has been pushing the boundaries of jazz, which he calls “quote-unquote jazz,” referencing the term’s origin as a racial slur. He merges African American music with Chinese opera and uses Duke Ellington-style swing in musicals and operas featuring female vampires, mythical monkeys, and now, green earth monsters. His music is arresting, indefinable, and unquestionably dramatic, aggressive in its motifs but always expansive in tone.
For Ho, combining musical messages with social emancipation is a vital part of his identity. Growing up as an Asian American in Amherst, Mass. in the 1960s, he says, “I’d faced racism ever since the day I’d become conscious as a young kid at age three.” “I was hit with the tidal wave of Black Power and the Black Arts movement,” he says of his teenage years. African American music and culture gave him a way to understand his Asian American identity, and he melded together these two influences in his explorations of jazz, which for him represents “the journey of the search for my identity and how we can achieve liberation.”
Liberation is an important concept for Ho; his first original composition to be performed by the Harvard Jazz Bands was “Liberation Genesis,” which he created in 1975 as an already prolific undergraduate musician. It was also during his time at Harvard that he became a Marxist, which he still remains today. “I don’t consider myself a Marxist with a capital ‘M,’” he says. “I believe that it’s not a dogma, it’s not a blueprint; it’s a creative science similar to music.”
At Saturday’s performance, Thomas Everett, Director of Bands at Harvard, paid homage to Ho’s unique sound, likening him to other jazz greats whose personalities and musical voices were inseparable. “You heard one note—Lester Young—and that was his voice,” Everett declared. “I hear the same thing in Fred’s baritone.” Ho’s playing is aggressive, sharp, often filled with wailing shrieks and guttural burps, but it always remains expansive and lyrical. “He can play seven octaves on the bari sax—he can do things with the bari sax that no-one else can do,” says Kristen M. Pagan ’10, who played in the Monday Jazz Band with Ho for “Take the Zen Train.”
According to Everett, Ellington, Charles Mingus and Sun Ra—who all pushed the boundaries of the musical forms they played—have all had some significant influence on Ho. “With Fred, it’s unpredictable. There’s no formula,” Everett says, citing the 11/4 meter in which one of the movements in “Take the Zen Train” is written. But Ho does not only draw on jazz for musical inspiration, he lists his influences as “everything, from Chinese opera to Korean pansori… to TV and movie themes and soundtracks.” He focuses on authenticity in music, claiming, “I have a fairly developed bullshit detector, so I don’t accept anything that is not sincere.” He distinguishes himself from today’s stagnant jazz world, which for him is dominated by “the regurgitators, young people who have tremendous technical proficiency, but no imagination, and worse, no soul.”
“Take the Zen Train” represents a new development in Ho’s philosophy that occurred after he was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2006. His entire approach to music has become part of a much more organic, earth-conscious process, and he is now focusing on a new project, the Green Monster Big Band. “The old Fred Ho that engaged in whatever produced the toxicity that led to my cancer, that path cannot be returned to now. I’m a part-time farmer now, farmer Fred. I’m about four years old now,” he says. He grows his own vegetables and now refers to his music as “revolutionary Earth music—I consider my music to be the music of farmers.” The big band jazz suite in “Take the Zen Train” makes innovative use of modal and blues tonalities, and symbolizes Ho’s desire for thoughtful self-realization and social action.
To produce a truly unconventional piece, Ho worked with director and choreographer Daniel Jáquez (who graduated from the A.R.T. Institute in 2000) and incorporated student dancers into the performance. Jáquez is one of many artists who have been influenced by Ho’s strong personality. He describes the process of choreographing the show as a quest guided by Ho’s desire for liberation. “It wasn’t like each dance was unusual, but we found the bizarreness of the dance in releasing the dancers’ strength, in trying to find new ways of responding to movement,” Jáquez says. Jáquez combined modern dance with hip-hop, classical, and martial arts elements, and his three dancers, painted as green monsters, counterpointed the music with their own flowing narrative.
Ho is hoping to bring “Take the Zen Train” and the Green Monster Big Band to New York venues soon. In the meantime, he is working on getting his Cancer Diaries published, and he continues advocating the lifelong social message he believes in. “It’s a mistake, an illusion to think that art is not political. All art is, even when it professes to not be. Because, even by not being political it simply rubberstamps the status quo,” he explains, adding, “[Art is] a sledgehammer against the façade. It’s a tool to construct a new society, a new reality.”

Pablo Francisco is an eclectic impressionist, human jukebox, and stand-up comedian. Best known for his parody of movie previews, Francisco has a knack for imitating everyone from Jackie Chan to Kermit the Frog—except, according to the comedian, for one man. “Everyone can do a Christopher Walken, but mine just sounds like a Jewish deli lady,” he quips. Returning from a tour across Europe, Francisco will be performing at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on November 21.
Francisco, now 35, began his career as the pizza guy who delivered to a stand-up club in Arizona. Until then, he recalls, comedy was “always something I was curious about, but I didn’t know you could make a living from it.” He has since become a comedic sensation, now a familiar face and voice on MadTV, Comedy Central, and Family Guy. Francisco attributes his popularity—which has garnered him recognition in even London, Amsterdam, and Sweden—to Internet exposure; clips of his sketches, which can easily be found on YouTube and other popular video sites, gather millions of views. “The Internet,” he explains, “is my TV.” Online fame has taken Francisco to unexpected places; he once landed a gig that paid over $20,000 to do an entire show for a single Indian family in North Carolina. “That was kind of crazy,” he recalls.
Francisco’s material often lampoons contemporary movies, music—he can produce compelling “techno” using only his voice—and culture. His ability to impersonate famous personalities, various ethnic accents, and characters from films has primarily contributed to the success of his satire. According to Francisco, developing this talent stems from self-assurance: “Once you get a couple impersonations down, you start to feel confident that you could probably go further.” Although these impressions appear effortless on stage, they often require a good deal of practice before they sound convincing. “Dennis Hopper came naturally,” Francisco says, slipping into the actor’s voice as he says Hopper’s name. “But Chris Rock—that took weeks.”
What separates Francisco from the rest of the impressionist pack, however, is one particular talent—the ability to mimic the ubiquitous voice of the “movie preview guy.” Otherwise known—albeit to a limited audience—as Don LaFontaine, “movie preview guy” has an unmistakable, almost superhuman voice that can be heard in more than 5,000 previews and nearly a quarter million commercials. LaFontaine’s deep cadences have long set the standard for the voiceover industry. As Ashton Smith, the man who narrated the promos for “XXX” put it, “When you die, the voice you hear in heaven is not Don’s. It’s God trying to sound like Don.” LaFontaine was seemingly inimitable. That is, until Pablo Francisco came along.
A couple decades ago, while joking around with friends and parodying the deep-voiced memory-training guru Harry Lorayne (who at the time peddled his techniques by radio), Francisco discovered that he could do “the movie guy.” This talent has incorporated itself into one of his greatest acts. On stage, at will, Francisco can drop his voice several octaves and intone, “Coming this summer. Action. Adventure. Romance.” In one sketch, Francisco invited the audience to imagine the voiceover to an upcoming action flick actually being honest: “Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in the same crap you’ve seen over, and over, and over again.” Coupling his ability to mimic LaFontaine to a repertoire of actor imitations, from Keanu Reeves to Al Pacino, Francisco is perhaps the only stand-up comedian who can act out an entire movie trailer live. His most famous faux cinematic concoction is “Little Tortilla Boy,” an action flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a street vendor trying to protect his tortilla business from the mob. The “trailer” ends with Francisco beatboxing a pounding bass while running in place in slow motion from an invisible explosion—showmanship that offers a glimpse at the sort of frenetic energy Francisco brings to the stage.
Francisco proved so apt at imitating LaFontaine that the vocal artist once invited Francisco to his home after seeing him perform on “The Tonight Show.” “He was really cool about it,” Francisco says, “and he looked at me and said, ‘You do me better than I do me.’” In fact, since LaFontaine passed away in 2008, Francisco has taken over some of his commercial duties.
But pillorying the movies as the “movie preview guy”—rather than advertising them—remains Francisco’s passion. For him, the choice to be a comedian was simple: “It pays good money, you can talk about anything you want, and you’re your own writer, director and performer—where else can you get that?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael “Big Mike” Oher—the protagonist of “The Blind Side”—has a GPA of 0.6 when he first shows up at Wingate Christian High School in Tennessee. His mother is a crack addict he hasn’t seen for years and his father is nonexistent. He carries one extra shirt around with him in a plastic bag. Some nights he sleeps on a stoop, some nights in the school gym, some nights on his friend Steven’s couch.
Over the course of John Lee Hancock’s captivating new film—based on the true story told in Michael Lewis’s book, “The Blind Side: The Evolution of a Game”—Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) transforms from a troubled orphan of the Memphis projects to a first-round draft pick in the NFL. Placed in a private, predominantly white high school on a whim by Steven’s father, Michael struggles to acclimate to the high academic standards of his new and foreign environment.  While walking along a sidewalk in shorts and a t-shirt on a cold November evening, he is spotted by the Tuohys, a wealthy family in an SUV. Their matriarch, Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock), invites him to spend Thanksgiving with her family, eventually taking him in permanently through legal adoption.
The film surprises not so much with the incredible story that it tells, but with the way in which it tells it. It’s clear from the very start that this will be an against-the-odds sports movie (likely a tearjerker) but what’s less expected is the humor that consistently accompanies the serious narrative.
While the film’s subject matter is undoubtedly grave, Hancock—who directed “The Rookie,” another compelling underdog story, in 2002—seems to understand that there is inherent humor in the uncomfortable melding of seismically different socio-economic backgrounds, and he never stops effectively exploiting these moments of drama as simultaneous opportunities for humor. “Who’d have thought we’d have a black son before we knew a democrat?” remarks Leigh Anne’s understanding husband, Sean, played by sometime actor Tim McGraw.
As Michael begins to improve in school, he is allowed to try out for sports and decides to join the spring football team. This pursuit quickly becomes a family affair; the Tuohy’s 10-year-old son, S.J., serves as a tyrannical fitness coach as well as a human dumbbell while Leigh Anne looks after Michael’s mental game. In response to the coach’s frustration at Michael’s apparent lack of aggression as blind-side offensive tackle, Leigh Anne marches onto the gridiron to interrupt practice, explaining to her son that he must protect his quarterback the way he would protect their family. “You can thank me later,” she tells the coach on her way back to the bleachers, Michael’s teammates ogling her as she goes.
Leigh Anne’s relationship with Michael forms the soul of the story. Both characters are limited in what they can verbally communicate to each other, but their silences convey their mutual struggle as they attempt to understand their respective circumstances. As Michael, relative newcomer Aaron is a strong yet vulnerable gentle giant—or, as Leigh Anne affectionately terms him, Ferdinand the Bull, the hero of his favorite children’s book. Bullock, too, wholeheartedly inhabits her role as pushy, driven, no-nonsense Southern wife cum interior decorator, complete with a perfect accent no doubt drawn from her Virginia roots. Kathy Bates also shines as Michael’s tutor, a fanatical devotee of her alma mater, Ole Miss. Once recruitment offers start pouring in, she takes it upon herself to warn Michael away from arch-rival University of Tennessee by convincing him of the body parts buried beneath their football field.
The film eventually gives us the immense satisfaction of seeing footage of the real Michael Oher and the Tuohys at his 2009 draft to the Baltimore Ravens. The extent to which the real-life family resembles their cinematic counterparts is shocking, from the affection of their interactions to their individual fashion sensibilities. We are reminded with these final scenes how closely the film follows its real-life foundation, and how dedicated it remains to its mission: to let the events speak for themselves and relish the humorous moments along the way.

Worlds collide in more ways than one in the intergalactic “Planet 51.” An animated alien science fiction comedy featuring Cold War social commentary and impressive CGI graphics, the film inverts the traditional “aliens attack Earth” storyline by portraying a human invasion of an alien society. Despite a political allegory that is too subtle for children yet too obvious for adults, the film succeeds as an entertainingly cute, if not totally memorable, space comedy.
The alien community of “Planet 51”—brought to life by co-directors Jorge Blanco, Javier Abad, and Marcos Martinez alongside screenwriter Joe Stillman (“Shrek”)—immediately calls to mind an idealized 1950s America. White picket fences and pink-lipsticked Stepford alien wives make up the charming atmosphere of their small-town utopia. The film acquires all the makings of a sci-fi romantic comedy when Lem, the teenage protagonist voiced by Justin Long (of Mac commercial and “He’s Just Not That Into You” fame), reveals his crush on Neera (Jessica Biel). But their budding romance is complicated when American astronaut Chuck Baker (voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson) lands on Planet 51 and is shocked to discover the thriving alien civilization. The Planet 51 community—extremely fearful of a hostile takeover by an “alien” race—persecutes Chuck, who solicits help from Lem in a quest to return to his home planet.
The blatant parallel with Cold War-era McCarthyism—which manifests itself through the growing paranoia of the aliens as they search for Chuck and accuse their fellow townspeople of being his zombie followers—is clever and original in a movie made for children. But most of the references will be lost on the film’s younger audiences, and reminders of the film’s political subtext—the aliens’ collection of UFO artifacts includes none other than the Sputnik satellite, complete with “USSR” imprinted in Russian—are frequent enough to be irritating to adult viewers.
The rest of the all-star cast funnels their respective talents into the standard roster of kid-movie roles. Sean William Scott (“Role Models”) takes on the wisecracking sidekick, while the inimitable John Cleese is the requisite Evil Professor, whose refined British accent seems wholly out of place in the apparently country-less Planet 51. As the unexpected visitor, Chuck is self-centered and arrogant, and he struggles to understand why the celebrity status he enjoyed at home carries no weight in his new surroundings. As he’s pursued by an army led by the blandly malevolent General Grawl (Gary Oldman), Chuck finds himself forced—albeit predictably—to come to terms with his excessive narcissism.  In a similar realization, Lem neatly delivers a moral lesson to his fellow townspeople regarding the danger of blindly fearing the unknown.
Despite this fairly straightforward unfolding of events, the film remains entertaining. Amid the obligatory smattering of slapstick comedy scenes, whimsically amusing details highlight the differences between Earth and Planet 51. The aliens exchange “high fours,” alien children don astronaut costumes for the premiere of a new “Humaniacs” movie, and Chuck’s “Macarena”-playing iPod is labeled a dangerous and cruel weapon. Chuck’s mechanized companion, Rover, is a source of endearing robot humor that resonates with all audiences, despite being shamelessly borrowed from “WALL-E.” Although veering on occasion towards crudity (“That’s an odd place for his antenna,” says one character after glimpsing Chuck in the nude), the movie’s humor keeps the film from becoming mired in political commentary.
“Planet 51” features several references to well-known space movies, notably “Alien” and “E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.” The dog-like alien pet belonging to Lem’s family recalls the eyeless, orb-like forehead of Sigourney Weaver’s original foe, while Elliott’s iconic bicycle silhouetted against the moon in “E.T.” is briefly parodied. By alluding to well-known scenes from past films, these references are perhaps a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement of some of the less original aspects of “Planet 51.” Though the political subtext fails to truly resonate with either audience, the film’s visual appeal and effective humor provide something for everyone.

Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, director and co-writer of the impressive “Bronson,” has made a name for himself hawking violence as a product. Most widely known for his “Pusher” trilogy that explores Denmark’s deadly drug underworld, Refn is surely more than aware of the parallel between himself and the subject of his sixth feature when it comes to making a spectacle of violence. “My name is Charlie Bronson,” whispers Tom Hardy, who delivers a superb, essentially solo performance as the eponymous character, “and all my life I’ve wanted to be famous.” For Bronson, it barely makes sense. And how could it? At 56, the real-life Charlie Bronson, born Michael Peterson, has spent 34 of the last 35 years in solitary confinement in various British correctional facilities, earning the moniker “Britain’s most violent prisoner.” The historical Charlie Bronson is a sociopath and a lunatic, a senseless rage-addict and a goon. But apply the words that open the film to the persona Refn manifests in Peterson and, more subtly, Refn himself, and “Bronson” offers a much more sensible portrait of the artist than it ever does of its subject. But ambitions at auto-portraiture aside, “Bronson” is, at its heart, a deeply engaging character study that suggests this man may be more (or less) than,­ but never equal to, the sum of his parts.
“Bronson” charms first and foremost in its framing device: Peterson is cast as his own narrator before an audience that seems to applaud at his command. He dresses elegantly, gestures wildly, and wears minstrel make-up of various colors throughout the performance, conducting himself like the ringmaster of some surreal circus. The stage, it seems, is Bronson’s fantasy, where he’s free to put his emotional world into order. When he’s first imprisoned, and finally alone, Peterson begins to cry; Bronson, on stage and in whiteface,  by contrast, reveals that they are crocodile tears and the audience begins to laugh on cue. Here, the ego of Michael Peterson seems to recede, and the precarious balance between the id and the superego manifests itself in the bursts of violence that are calmly—and even comically—retold by the performative narrator.
However monotonous the subject matter could potentially be, Refn finds a way to constantly reinvigorate the contrast between Bronson and the world around him; he’s taken to the hole, then to the insane asylum, where he performs and sabotages himself in bombastic fashion. It’s with Peterson as a free man, however, released from prison for nearly 70 days in 1988, that the film offers up the closest thing to a sensible psychological portrait of someone who, up to that point and from that point thereafter, resembles something more akin to a force of nature than a human being. Peterson returns to the town of his birth and falls in with a set of predominantly-homosexual mobsters, who lease him out for dogfights and bare-knuckle boxing matches. He dons the name Charlie Bronson in homage to the action star of the same name, famous for his role in “Death Wish.” Here again, his penchant for violence is totally divested from any emotional disposition, but these scenes in particular are uniquely cruel. He’s unable to express mature feelings of desire for women, and, combined with his rippling physique, this deeply repressed libido renders him a sort of man-child that the scenes in prison never so much as hint at.
But however these broad psychoanalytic gestures can be interpreted, they provide little in the way of a satisfactory theory for why the man is the way he is. Far from lionizing him, Refn isn’t interested in reducing Bronson to an animal, a rebel or a martyr. The film’s haunting final scene is certainly a moment of revelation in relief with the story that Refn chooses to tell, but it’s less a moralization than a confirmation of suspicions. Throughout the film proper, however, Bronson remains a living paradox: a submissive sadist, a free slave, an absurd hero.
In the moments on the outside—where the swaggering Bronson is, for once, ill at ease—the film is at its funniest. Flushed and shaking with rage, he manages to suppress a violent outburst when his sweetheart declines his marriage proposal for another man. Believing his fighting prowess would find him fame overnight, he complains to his handler that his most recent display was underappreciated “magic”: “Magic? You just pissed on a gypsy in the middle of fucking nowhere. It’s hardly the hottest ticket in town.” The world takes its measure of Charlie Bronson, and finds him wanting. But his return to prison isn’t far behind.
The film’s final third, where Bronson begins to produce drawings and paintings for his prison’s art program, synthesizes the film’s content with its narrative frame without reducing the enigma of its subject. Bronson’s art is, from what can be seen, mostly cartoonish grotesquery more reminiscent of Daniel Johnston than Basquiat, but his final “piece” is executed with as much theatrical verve and visual splendor in a series of moments as the rest of the film offers in its entirety.
“Bronson” is, by nature, just short of flawless. Despite an incredible performance from Hardy, the story’s limitations render every other character—from his girlfriend to his quick-witted handler to the chilling pedophile that approaches him in the asylum—fundamentally marginal. It would be a pleasure to watch Hardy’s undeniable range and power at play alongside other talent for extended periods of time; for all his breadth, his character has only two speeds (break-neck and dead-stop) and very little depth. Instead, “Bronson” remains a riveting one-man show, and that’s all it ever asked to be.

The directorial debut of Oren Moverman—co-screenwriter of 2007’s sprawling “I’m Not There”— follows two men with a job that no one would envy. As officers of the U.S. Army, they are tasked with the brutal responsibility of informing the next-of-kin of a soldier’s death. In the vein of other recent films like “Stop-Loss,” “The Messenger” is a war movie without combat, a military film focused more on the home front than the frontline. But Moverman’s film moves beyond politics, functioning as a tender meditation on loss rather than a forced lesson about the evils of war.
After returning from combat duty in Iraq with an injured leg and eye, Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) is assigned to casualty notification duty to fill the three months left in his service. He is reluctant to take the assignment, thinking himself unfit to deliver such emotionally delicate news, especially while he is dealing with demons of his own. In the first few scenes, we discover that Montgomery has been recognized for war heroism, the reasons for which remain ambiguous until the movie’s end. We also find out that he’s maintained a close relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Kelly (Jena Malone), who sleeps with him immediately upon his arrival home only to reveal that she’s been considering marrying her new boyfriend. Montgomery is soon paired with a gruff superior named Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), a recovering alcoholic and serial womanizer who at first glance seems to be a stern, humorless caricature of a military man.
But through this intensely character-driven movie, Montgomery—and the audience—gradually warms to Stone as Harrelson deftly portrays the nuanced and deeply vulnerable character as plagued by feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. The foundation of the film is the development of this cautious friendship between the two men, a relationship marked by regular returns to the same seedy bar. Stone is eager to move past the professional boundaries of his role as Montgomery’s superior, and an ambivalent Montgomery is slowly drawn to Stone’s sincere rambling. Foster plays Montgomery with admirable restraint, highlighting the character’s overwhelming desire to control his own emotions. His silences are imbued with a deep confusion; his eyes communicate a tremendous burden of which he lacks the words to describe. Moverman’s privileging of the rapport between Stone and Montgomery hints at a tragic corollary: war seems to have robbed both men of any meaningful connections apart from their professional relationships even in their hometown.
Despite its intensity, “The Messenger” avoids becoming emotionally manipulative. The reactions of the next-of-kin upon receiving the news are varied, from violent outbursts to calm acceptance. Like Montgomery and Stone, we see these individuals only at their weakest moment, left with a single, striking image. There are no build-ups or resolutions, and, as such, the film rarely slips into facile sentimentalism. Instead, the audience sees only an immediate reaction, captured by a trembling handheld camera as opposed to traditional close-up techniques. Warned against giving hugs and other gesture of comfort, the men can do nothing but stand and watch in stoic rigidity.
Moverman underscores the perpetual untimeliness of death in day-to-day life. The brief and rare use of music is entirely diegetic, stemming only from sources within the scenes, such as a barroom jukebox or a beaten-up car stereo. Montgomery’s first somber exchange with Stone, for example, is set to a cheery Beach Boys tune. The movie also resists the impulse to tailor the style of scenes to their emotional underpinnings; in one scene, a woman discovers that her husband has died on the sunniest, most peaceful of early fall days. With a careful hand in these details, Moverman conveys the characters’ hardest undertaking: recognizing that life blithely continues no matter the magnitude of personal grief. “The Messenger” taps into this message by conveying—wonderfully and unexpectedly—a small sense of humor amid so much desolation. As Stone and Montgomery playfully bicker about whose car to take and who gets to drive, the film reveals both the bitter and the sweet that many war-inspired films tend to miss.
If “The Messenger” has a weakness, it comes at the end, when Montgomery falls in love with a widow named Olivia (Samantha Morton). Morton is powerful as always but Olivia’s plainness is such that we can never quite understand Montgomery’s intense attraction to her, making that storyline fall a bit flat. But this is a minor blip on the face of a memorable force of a film—one that captures emotion without theatricality, humor without insult, and hardship without self-pity. “The Messenger” delivers not just a war movie, but a moving drama in its own right.

“The uncertainty that reigns in San José is perhaps similar to tranquility, but it is not the same; people go home early… then doors close and San José agonizes in the heat.” Muted violence is doubly frightening; harder to confront, yet perversely easier to live with, it becomes an atmosphere, lurid and inert. It’s this atmosphere that permeates “The Armies,” Columbian writer Evelio Rosero’s latest novel. Like the best literary treatments of trauma, “The Armies” utters its violence quietly, with the clear-eyed intensity of a fever dream.
The first of Rosero’s works to be translated into English, “The Armies” was the recipient of the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize earlier this year. This short, sharp novel recounts a few days in the life of the narrator Ismael, a retired schoolteacher who lives with his wife in San José, a fictional Colombian town nestled in the highlands and surrounded by coca plantations. In the latest spate of politically-motivated violence, some citizens are murdered while others—probably including Ismael’s wife, though it’s never made clear—are kidnapped. Once content to drink coffee in the plaza and daydream about beautiful young women, Ismael is suddenly stricken by his wife’s disappearance and sets out to look for her.
Rosero never reduces the complexity of Colombia’s political situation, nor does he impose any prevailing moral framework upon the story. Its title—in Spanish, “Los Ejercitos”—refers to all three “sides” of the conflict that blights rural Colombia: the military, the paramilitaries, and the guerrillas. In the violence that comes to engulf San José, it is impossible—and, perhaps, pointless—to distinguish between them. Ismael remembers the recent attack on the local church, “by whichever army it was, whether the paramilitaries or guerrillas.” The combatants are “slow silent figures, which emerge blurry from the last horizon of the corners.” In “The Armies,” brutality is so arbitrary and ubiquitous that it comes to resemble an implacable force of nature more than the product of human agency.
The sumptuousness of Ismael’s garden as he describes it—where oranges grow fat and succulent in the blazing sunshine—echoes in his descriptions of the attractive young family living next door. The object of his desire is Geraldina, a wife and mother of two, whom he admires from his vantage point atop a ladder while picking oranges. His wife, Otilia, notes and censures his voyeurism, but Ismael’s desire is compulsive and extends to every young female character we meet. Each is subjected to his scopophilia, described in terms that evoke the ripeness of fruit; Gracelita, aged twelve, is “almost plump, and yet willowy” and sways her backside as she washes the dishes, while Geraldina sunbathes naked, “stretched out with no concern other than the color of her skin.” By taking every opportunity to remind us of his narrator’s transgressive fixations, Rosero interrogates the limits of our sympathy as readers. Is our identification with the suffering of others unconditional or, in fact, contingent upon the goodness of the sufferer? “The Armies” has no clear answer, but it hints at a radical skepticism that sits uneasily with our expectations of a novel that bears witness to the suffering of innocents.
We come to realize, however, that these prurient meditations represent more than the lecherous fantasies of an old man. Early in the novel, Ismael recalls the dire circumstances in which he and his wife first met; in the bus station of a nearby town they both witnessed the shooting of a man by an eleven year-old boy. Rushing nauseated to the lavatory, Ismael walked in on his future wife sitting on the toilet and was instantly transfixed: “… her eyes like lighthouse beams over the hitched up island, the join of her legs, the triangle of her sex—indescribable animal.” He tells us that the murder and the incident in the toilet “went on recurring, becoming associated, in an almost absurd way, in my memory: first death, then nakedness.”
The discomfiting union of sex and mortality is a recurring trope of “The Armies.” So clogged and abortive are Ismael’s desires that his visions of the female form are as morbid as they are irresistible; between every woman’s legs is a “wild darkness,” an “infinity” to which Ismael’s eyes are always drawn. We are reminded of “King Lear,” in which the vagina is, similarly, an entry to an unknowable—and therefore threatening—interior, a “dark and vicious place,” in Edgar’s words. In “The Armies,” Ismael’s vexed desires have long been mingled with the constant threat of violence from paramilitaries and guerrillas, as though the most effervescent expression of life—lust—has unconsciously incorporated death.
Rosero’s choice of name for his protagonist puts us in mind of another famous first-person narrator and survivor of catastrophe: Herman Melville’s Ishmael, who lives to tell the tale in “Moby Dick.” Melville’s epilogue is taken from the book of Job: “And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.” Like Job, Rosero’s Ismael has no part in the processes governing the destruction of his life but is forced to take up the challenge to his faith. When the other inhabitants of San José flee in trucks, Ismael refuses to leave, choosing instead to honor the promise he and Otilia made during the last attack: “Neither Otilia nor I had any hesitation: we were never leaving here.”
As the violence intensifies, Ismael becomes willing to face death with Job-like submission: “let God’s will be done, whatever pleases God, whatever he feels like.” But Rosero does not glorify Ismael; his illicit desires never cease. Although his love for his wife is, ultimately, the rubric by which he lives, we glimpse redemption only in his small acts of imaginative tenderness, as when Ismael decides, in his wife’s absence, to bury the cat that was killed in an explosion, “so that you shall never see your cat dead, Otilia.”
“The Armies” begins with an epigraph from Moliere: “N’y a-t-il point quelque danger a contrefaire le mort?” (“Is there not some danger in refusing death?”). Rosero’s novel offers us an answer: to refuse death is to invite madness in the form of Ismael’s cultish devotion to his missing wife. But it is also to maintain a kind of integrity, to supplant the inevitability of death with the logic of love, by marshalling “all the force and stubbornness of a light in the middle of the fog that men call hope.”

Jonathan Safran Foer is fascinated by trauma. His first novel, the critically acclaimed “Everything is Illuminated,” chronicled his young facsimile’s eastern European journey to unpack the lives of his Holocaust-survivor relatives. “Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,” his second, was a deeply-felt emotional mosaic about the resonance between the 9/11 attacks and the Dresden firebombings. Foer’s first work of nonfiction, “Eating Animals,” has a different sort of trauma in mind: the suffering inflicted on livestock by the American meat industry.
Despite these adjustments, however, Foer’s formidable intellect remains preoccupied with the nature of violence and how a thinking person should go about dealing with it in the world. A recent father, Foer undertook the research for “Eating Animals”—an examination of the various aspects of animal agriculture—in order to come to an informed decision about whether or not to feed meat to his newborn son. What follows is a harsh portrayal of the modern factory-farming industry and an unflinching investigation of the implications that it has both for human morality and life in America.
Foer devotes most of this book to providing a detailed condemnation of industrial animal agriculture—or factory farming—which provides more than 99% of the meat consumed in America today and which has exactly nothing to do with the pastoral image most people associate with the word “farm.”
“Since I encountered the realities of factory farming, refusing to eat conventional meat has not been a hard decision,” Foer writes. “And it’s become hard to imagine who, besides those who profit from it, would defend factory farming.” In a way, this is an evasion; Foer blames the most egregious ethical problems on how meat is raised, but is reluctant to conclusively delineate whether it is wrong to eat animals raised more comfortably.
Although many people are vaguely aware that factory-farmed animals are kept in small, crowded enclosures and are subject to painful slaughter procedures, Foer exposes the suffering of these animals throughout their entire lives, focusing largely on the degree to which the animals’ natural behaviors are disrupted. Industrial pigs, chickens and seafood (and, to a lesser extent, cattle) are prevented from engaging in any of their instinctive behaviors; chickens are kept in tiny cages and often kill and cannibalize each other for lack of social hierarchy. Pigs and fish undergo similar experiences. “I simply cannot feel whole when so knowingly, so deliberately, forgetting [animal suffering],” Foer writes.
Foer’s choice to engage this treatment in relief with human morality provides a context that may give pause to those who choose to consume factory-farmed products. “Eating Animals” is the most readable and thorough work on the subject of meat-eating since Michael Pollan’s “The Omnivore’s Dilemma,” which deals extensively with the question of eating meat and concludes that it is best to limit meat intake but not eliminate it entirely, based mainly on health and sustainability reasons.
Perhaps it’s counterproductive to belabor animal suffering in the way that Foer does; those who eat meat often argue that it is irrelevant to apply the same morality we do to human suffering. Foer makes an excellent argument that for himself and much of his audience meat is nutritionally unnecessary and ecologically harmful, but using a moral argument to evince a change in people’s daily lives may be ineffective. Foer’s facts are visceral and damning for those who sympathize, but they may not be enough.
Nonbelievers may find Foer’s arguments about factory-farming’s human impact more convincing. He enumerates issues of water pollution, abuse of the work force, cutthroat competition with local businesses and near-intolerably low health standards. Foer could have written a book just about these aspects of industrial farming, and it may well have provided a more compelling rationale for choosing vegetarianism. But it would have been less affecting. However, like his novels, “Eating Animals” often uses graphics, such as a small box the size of an industrial chicken cage, to illustrate a point. This is almost always trite and unnecessary, and undermines his credibility as a serious thinker about an important issue.
Even if some find Foer’s style to be cloying and contrived, he is, for better or for worse, one of the more important and accessible chroniclers of violence and morality in contemporary literature. “Eating Animals” is the first high-profile work to directly address the question of the meat industry’s ethical, ecological and economical sustainability in America.
What lends “Eating Animals” its power, though, is neither its scope nor its journalistic merit. Rather, the importance of “Eating Animals” lies in the depth and nuance of Foer’s argument and in the portrait he sketches of animal agriculture as it stands today. Foer is occasionally shrill in his denunciation of factory farms, but his examination of animal welfare representatives—a vegan activist, several “ethical farmers” and a small slaughterhouse owner—is both more in-depth and more critically engaged, if for no other reason than he had the opportunity to actually talk to them.
Even if Foer’s conception of himself as a concerned citizen rather than a journalist is silly and pedantic, it is a necessary one in the context that he provides. The decision to eat meat is central, though perhaps more banal, in a way that other moral dilemmas are not. As Foer notes, culture is expressed in eating practices, and to change what we eat is to fundamentally change our identity. But change can also mean progress, and although diehard carnivores looking for reasons not to give up meat will find holes in Foer’s argument, it is more compelling and accessible than most arguments for vegetarianism. Even those who choose not to change their eating habits will come away from the book thinking more critically about their food, something that both vegetarians and omnivores should strive to do.

“That’s Theseus... He’s got this ball of string his girlfriend gave him, see. And he’s using it to find his way back out of the maze,” the young Calliope is told by her father. Drawing from the Greek heritage that the two of them share, Calliope Stephanides, the hermaphrodite narrator of Jeffrey Eugenides’ second novel “Middlesex” who will come to be known as Cal, follows the history of his family across two generations and one ocean in order to come to terms with the tragedy of his very existence. In tracing the thread of his own improbable lineage, Cal becomes a recursive hero; sorting, like Theseus, through a thread whose interminability confines him forever, like the Minotaur, to his prison. Mediating the scope of classical tragedy through the lens of immigration and heritage in America, Eugenides brilliantly maps the drama of antiquity onto the American landscape.
“Middlesex” is Cal’s novel: a family history tracking the recessive gene mutation that accounts for his troubling condition as “a male pseudohermaphorodite—genetically male, but appearing otherwise.” He starts in Turkey: siblings Desdemona and Lefty flee that country’s conflict with Greece to start anew in America as husband and wife. In Detroit, cousins Milton and Tessie fall in love and become engaged amidst the turmoil of the Second World War. Calliope, their daughter—born and raised as a girl—learns of her Y chromosome after a tractor accident brings her to a hospital. In a moment of radical loss of identity, she flees her home and moves to San Francisco. Struggling to escape the vestiges of femininity and grappling with loneliness and alienation, Calliope becomes Cal and sets to the reflective task of writing “Middlesex.”
Eugenides deftly weaves each generation’s narratives together to form an epic saga brimming with parallels. While each new generation drifts further in identity, culture, and success from its predecessor, the reality of the collective tragedy that culminates in Cal/Calliope’s gender dysphoria is unavoidable. “But in the end it wasn’t up to me. The big things never are. Birth, I mean, and death. And love. And what love bequeaths to us before we’re born,” he remarks.
The disjunctions in time and distance serve to highlight the similarities of each generation and their plight. As Cal recounts fleeing his past and his family for San Francisco, he states “A ship didn’t carry me across the ocean; instead, a series of cars conveyed me across a continent. I was becoming a new person, too, just like Lefty and Desdemona, and I didn’t know what would happen to me in this new world to which I’d come.” Cal’s sexual transformation is, for his generation, as heroic and insurmountable a task as immigration and assimilation was for his grandparents, if not moreso.
As a uniquely omniscient first-person narrator, Cal recounts his family’s story, including scenes and thoughts that he could not possibly know, adding his own opinions, musings, and questions. Describing his father’s conception, Cal poses, “Parents are supposed to pass down physical traits to their children, but it’s my belief that all sorts of other things get passed down, too: motifs, scenarios, even fates. Wouldn’t I also sneak up on a girl pretending to be asleep?” Cal is able to wax lyrical about the grand scheme of things, but still retains the intimacy that first-person perspective guarantees. This innovative approach also reflects Cal’s unique circumstances: belonging to the story being told yet isolated by his disorder; identifying with both sexes yet foreign to either one; socially aware yet ostracized by society.
Throughout his tale, Cal recounts a century of American history—Ellis Island, the Great Depression, the River Rouge Ford plant, Vietnam, Detroit race riots, the desegregation of schools, Watergate, the Cold War, and the oil embargoes. In doing so, Eugenides questions what it means to be American—citizenship, attitude, and history. Despite being third generation American and despite her family having climbed the class ladder­—at least achieving the financial aspect of the American Dream—Calliope feels out of place in her private preparatory all-girls school. “Until we came to Baker & Inglis my friends and I had always felt completely American. But now the Bracelets’ upturned noses suggested that there was another America to which we could never gain admittance... It was about something that had happened for two minutes four hundred years ago, instead of everything that had happened since. Instead of everything that was happening now.” The confusion as to what comprises national identity reflects the complexity of what determines sexual identity. Each have simple answers—citizenship and genitalia—that pose more questions—assimilation and the gendered mind. Though the Bracelets derive their certainty and power from their families’ past, Cal finds little consolation and few answers in his own warped past.
Eugenides juxtaposes—almost cruelly—a narrative that barrels through history and the reality of Cal’s reflective intransigence. The novel’s historical reflections are interspersed with fragments of Cal’s search for emotional connection, and his flight from that connection into anonymity and loneliness. These passages manifest Cal as the tragic center of the novel. “If this story is written only for myself, then so be it. But it doesn’t feel that way. I feel you out there, reader. This is the only kind of intimacy I’m comfortable with. Just the two of us, here in the dark,” admits Cal. The process of writing stunts and spurs Cal’s acceptance of his condition. He confronts yet is enslaved by the past, the cosmic and minute details that allow for his existence. He admits and illuminates his condition, but to an anonymous reader who cannot offer him solace. We’re grateful for being dragged along for the journey, but conflicted as to whether we want him to complete Theseus’ task—cheering for Cal to defeat the Minotaur within him yet not wanting him to rewind the string of his narrative to that first knot, where he would have to bring to a close this sweeping story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Views of Americans as impolite and disrespectful are all too common. This global perception neither is an asset when navigating the intricacies of foreign policy, nor does it make potential allies especially receptive to American propositions. Courtesy and cultural sensitivity should be considered of paramount importance when dealing with other nations, and President Obama’s respectful bow to the Japanese emperor represents a sincere attempt to express respect and cultural acumen. Rather than deride this incident, observers should appreciate that Obama treats other countries with deserved respect.
When Obama visited Japan to advance America’s foreign-policy agenda, he attempted to convey cultural awareness by bowing. His bow was not perfectly executed. In this case, though, it’s the thought that counts. The intention of the bow was not to show submission or excessive deference. Critics who claim the bow served as a sign of weakness are misguided. The gesture solely demonstrated cultural sensitivity and was essentially harmless.
Similarly, the critique that this is a peculiar gesture or in some way not in keeping with a tradition of diplomacy misses the mark; former President Nixon attempted a similar gesture when he met with an emperor of Japan in 1971, albeit with more success. Nixon certainly had other problems with his presidency, but showing respect to a foreign dignitary was not one of them.
Grandstanding and prideful refusals to acknowledge cultural norms are not in the interests of the U.S. and should not be part of American diplomacy. Indeed, the fact that Obama’s bow managed to precipitate a media controversy indicates that spectators are too easily distracted from the real and substantive issues at hand. It is true, though, that in the world of foreign policy the subtleties and nuances of behavior can influence the discussion of serious issues. The attempt to be culturally sensitive can immediately start negotiations off on the right foot.
Of course, the bow should have been better executed, but the effort counted for a lot. Rather than deriding shows of respect to foreign representatives and attempting to extract unsupported conclusions, one should view the president’s choice as one that is an exercise in building goodwill. His decision to bow was a wise choice, not a weak one.

I have a confession to make: I stopped reading the Harry Potter series halfway through book five. That alone wouldn’t be so shocking, if not also for this: I’m on the Harvard Quidditch Team. Somehow, though, my lack of expertise (I haven’t picked up any of the books in six years) hasn’t affected my enjoyment of the game one bit. Incredibly, collegiate Quidditch stands extremely well on its own as an actual sport—and is remarkably enjoyable even if you don’t remember who or what the hell “Cedric Diggory” is.
The first thing most people probably think of when they hear of Quidditch is role-playing, thereby relegating the sport to the “nerd” bin with the likes of “Dungeons and Dragons” and “Magic: The Gathering.” It is true that the sport, founded in 2005 at Middlebury College in Vermont (and the origin of the modern 200-plus-team Intercollegiate Quidditch League), incorporates the rules of the fictional game as literally as possible.
To make up for a lack of flight, for example, all players must carry a broom between their legs at all times. Chasers run down the field with the Quaffle (a volleyball) while attempting to evade other Chasers, Beaters throwing Bludgers (dodgeballs), and the Keeper (that’s me) to score a goal through the opposing team’s hoops. In the meantime, off the field, Seekers fight to catch the Snitch, a neutral player dressed in a gold track suit who is allowed to run anywhere on the college campus. A goal is worth 10 points, and the Snitch, if and when it is finally captured, is worth 30. At first glance, this is nothing more than harmless little Potter fans playing out their fantasies.
But don’t be fooled. The sport is anything but tame.
The brooms serve as a handicap, since there are so few restrictions on contact between players. Hair-pulling and neck-grabbing are forbidden, but slide-tackling, body-checking, tripping, and shoulder-checking are all fair game. The Snitch has even fewer restrictions. According to the official rulebook, the Snitch “may do whatever it takes to avoid capture within the realm of common sense and morality,” which in past games has included throwing mud into players’ eyes and headbutting them to the ground. Play only stops for a foul, there is no out-of-bounds area, and there is no clock. The game ends with the capture of the Snitch, and until then no one is safe from a surprise tackle or body slam.
The result is sheer, brutal anarchy, an absurd and ludicrous hybrid of rugby, dodgeball, basketball, and soccer. Serious injuries abounded among other teams at the Middlebury Quidditch World Cup this past October. One player from Emerson College broke a Chaser’s clavicle, another team’s Beater broke a few fingers, and rumor has it that in a past year’s tournament one player robbed a girl of her cornea. There may truly be no better two words to describe the appeal of the game than those of a Crimson reporter: “badass mayhem.”
Indeed, after playing the game for over a month, you come to realize that the thrill of winning a bloody fight for the Quaffle or firing a direct shot through an opponent’s hoop is not the inner Potter geek giddying with glee. It’s the instinctive drive for glory. It’s the extraordinary spirit of this unbelievable game, the utter bliss of pugilism, crusading to crush the opposing team into submission. This is the ultimate agony and ecstasy of intercollegiate Quidditch. And no magical knowledge, fortunately, is required to enjoy it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The hardest lesson I’ve learned during my time at Harvard is that happiness and success are not zero-sum games.
I hadn’t really ever thought of that until earlier this year. Giving a tour amidst the calm energy of Tercentenary Theatre in September, I was asked if Harvard was competitive. I said it was not. I remembered overhearing on one college visit that students would rip out the pages of library coursepacks so that other students couldn’t use them before exams. I’d never experienced anything like that at Harvard. On the contrary, a certain sympathy saturates the drudgery of Lamont during reading period.
I didn’t reconsider my generalization until a lazy dinner late that night with a few buddies from freshman year. Somebody mentioned that a friend of ours had just been offered a job at a prestigious bank in New York that he had wanted for some time. He was well qualified, hard-working, friendly, and competent. We all agreed that the position would be good for him. And then somebody added with an uncomfortable sneer—the kind that tips the balance from humor to spite—that the position would suit him well since he had no moral scruples whatsoever.
The remark didn’t strike me as particularly odd. I’d grown accustomed to similar digs over the past three years in a network of caustic and insightful peers. But when framed in the context of competitiveness, the comment seemed a bit more upsetting. Maybe the academic rivalry was not overwhelming at Harvard, but didn’t the stress of personal competition fill every day and every interaction? Who was working where? Who was going someplace exotic for J-term? Whose social life seemed more fulfilling? Who seemed happy?
The high level of interpersonal competition at Harvard might seem obvious, and discussing it, trite. But something about this quest for individuality here fascinates me, the innate desire to find something in oneself that validates existence amidst genius. For some, it’s the raw intellectual horsepower. For others, it’s the ability to navigate complex social hierarchies, to read men instinctively. For yet others, it’s the ability to cling to morals when others toss theirs aside. Maybe it’s just having the right combination of all the above. To justify one’s presence at the most selective college in the country, everybody needs something—something to set them apart from the crowd.
This yearning to be an individual is certainly not unusual, but the social and intellectual conditions at Harvard intensify it. We’re exposed to some of the smartest, some of the most talented, some of the wealthiest (but perhaps not some of the best-looking) young people in the country. Somehow in the struggle to cope with all the talent and prestige, with the sliding scale of relative happiness in constant flux, we criticize. We cling to the thing about ourselves we find distinctive. We fear so passionately that somebody might have everything—brains, looks, social connections, a sense of humor—that we tear down and pick apart.  Nobody should have a beach house in Antigua and a summa thesis. Nobody should be a Class Marshal and a Rhodes Scholar.  The person who got that job at Morgan Stanley is a “moron.” Our friend working for his senator is an “alcoholic.”
Since it is the overwhelming nature of people, bright people in particular, to criticize, to find fault, and to justify, this column might seem naïve. Indeed, the cultural consensus at Harvard is not easily remedied. It seeps so completely into our thoughts that most written records of campus activities build their reputation on negativity, on attacking events or individuals, on finding points of weaknesses and whittling them into biting criticism. Is the snarkiness, the culture of condemnation so engrained in campus life and our nature that there’s nothing to be done?
Perhaps there is nothing concrete, no policy point or direct action item. But for me, when I acknowledged how competitive things actually are, my outlook shifted. Realizing the motivation of the snideness helped remove it from my psychology. My long-term success was not threatened by that of a peer, even if it seemed otherwise as I stared him down outside of the McKinsey interview. Somebody else’s failure in class would not somehow enhance my experience.
So the next time somebody asks me on a tour if Harvard is competitive, I suppose I’ll say that it is. I’ll say that the convergence of so much talent in such a small space creates a natural friction. But that tension forces oneself to reconcile one’s strengths in comparison to those of others, to realize that finding the imperfections of our peers does not correct our own insecurities. Harvard’s greatest lesson to me, taught through elections and exams, through papers and punches, is that the competition to be distinct—to be happy—ends with no predetermined number of winners.

Nearly two months ago, this column chronicled a financial misadventure whereby I got stuck paying $70 in overdraft fees to Bank of America because I had overdrafted my account by $6. In case you can’t remember that far back, the mood was outrage. I had been automatically enrolled in a so-called service—of which there is no opting out—that charges $35 for transactions you make when you have no money left in your checking account.
Some senators were agitated, too. There was heavy talk of legislative action starting in September when it was reported that banks expected to draw $38.5 billion this year in “overdraft protection services,” 90 percent of which was coming from 10 percent of checking accounts. It’s the people who can least afford it who subsidize the rest of us.
Big banks were less enthusiastic about changing the rules. In a year when the economy was slumping and consumer spending was way down, overdraft fees had become more profitable than traditional banking for half of America’s banks. After losing more than $300 million in the third quarter last year, Visa made a big push for its Visa check cards—basically just glorified debit cards—and recently announced netting more than $500 million this quarter.
Following months of criticism from consumer advocacy groups, the Federal Reserve, which is the body in charge of regulating this sort of activity, finally got its act together and issued a new set of rules last Thursday restricting overdraft services to come into effect July 1. In case you missed the announcement, the new rules require banks to obtain the express approval of cardholders before signing them up for overdraft protection and to explain the policies in easy-to-understand language.
But the regulation ends there. Recurring payments, like utility bills, or anything you pay for with a check will still be subject to overdraft fees. Think about all the other beneficial changes that could have been made. Overdraft protection is extremely helpful for some people (myself not included), but the new rules leave you to choose between getting ripped off and not having any protection at all. Suppose, as one bill floating around Washington proposes, that, rather than a $35 flat fee, overdraft charges were proportional to the size of the overdraft—or that you were permitted a limited number of overdrafts each year at a reasonable rate. The Fed regulation doesn’t preclude these measures from being considered by Congress, but it makes immediate action on a bill that had a questionable amount of support to begin with far less likely.
Admittedly, I would rather have these rules than no rules, but the episode is a good reminder of how difficult it can be to pass effective financial regulation, even for something as minor and clearly exploitative as overdraft protection services. It doesn’t make you optimistic about ever setting good rules on credit cards, whose effect on our society is far more pernicious. Credit-card regulation passed last spring was a good start but ultimately does little more than limit banks’ ability to market credit cards to students and require them to warn you before they do something like raise your interest rates from 19 to 30 percent in the space of one month, even if you haven’t missed a payment, just because the issuer claims to have identified heightened systemic risk.
The last time we got close to writing drastic regulation on credit or debit cards was in 1991, when 74 senators voted in favor of a 14 percent interest-rate cap on credit cards. George H. W. Bush had given a fundraising speech in New York where he talked about lowering credit-card rates, a bullet point that had been included at the last minute by his chief of staff but hadn’t been approved by his economic advisors. Support from a Republican president lent congressional Democrats the air cover to move a bill that received no more than 30 minutes of debate on the Senate floor before passing by a vote 74-19, a vote seemingly bereft of partisanship. Perhaps the measure had taken them so much by surprise that senators hadn’t entirely accounted for the political ramifications of a bill that clearly enjoyed their visceral support. In any event, intense industry pressure convinced lawmakers to abandon the effort and left them trying to explain that, while they favored lower rates, they weren’t sure that caps were the way to accomplish that.
Some Americans, and certainly the banks, don’t see a need for tighter regulation of credit and/or debit cards. If people can’t stop themselves from spending money at the mall, they should have to suffer the consequences, even if the shape those consequences might take is never entirely clear. That’s one theory. Another line of reasoning: Much of what governs people’s behavior when it comes to credit and debit cards are poorly designed rules, which allow things like overdraft services to systematically take advantage of people’s laziness or bad habits. Either way, the outcome is predatory. There is no other word to explain the fact that Americans carry an average of eight credit cards and as much as $10,000 in unpaid balances and that, as a country, our collective credit-card debt now tops $960 billion. To shame that these costs fall on the shoulders of those who are least well positioned to shoulder them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Against all expectations and amid whispers of scandal, the Undergraduate Council’s Election Commission did not name a winner in the UC presidential elections Thursday night.
Neither John F. Bowman ’11 nor George J.J. Hayward ’11, waiting at victory parties in the Quad, saw the Election Commission arrive to congratulate them.
Instead, the proceedings devolved into a late-night drama in which the Election Commission decertified voting results that indicated a Bowman victory, three EC officials resigned, and an unidentified person sent a controversial e-mail from the UC president’s e-mail account.
The student body, meanwhile, remained in the dark about who will lead its chief governing body for the next two semesters.
Numbers released by former Election Commission Chair Brad A. Seiler ’10 yesterday evening suggested that Hayward and running mate Felix M. Zhang ’11 had lost the election by just 45 votes—the smallest margin of victory in a Council election in recent memory.
Voting for all UC elections operates under the Hare-Clark single transferable vote system in which voters rank their candidates by preference. Votes are then tallied in successive rounds until one ticket receives a majority.
In an initial tally of first-place votes, Hayward and Zhang recorded 1,594 votes—31 more first-choice selections than Bowman and Hysen—but none of the tickets garnered the required majority. At that point, Long-Johnson came up short, and the ticket’s 635 first-place votes were excluded from consideration. Their supporters’ second choices were then added to the vote counts of the other tickets.
After the redistribution, the Bowman-Hysen campaign received an additional 263 votes for a total of 1,826 votes, giving them an edge—and the majority—over Hayward-Zhang, which received 187, for a total of 1,781.
The Election Commission traditionally announces the official results of the election in a ceremony at the winning candidate’s end-of-campaign party. But last night the Commission never left the Yard, announcing shortly after 10 p.m. that they were convening for a last-minute meeting.
Some EC members had expressed concerns about the voting process in the hours after the tabulation, according to EC member and UC representative Phillip Morris ’12, who added that there were “loopholes” in the electronic voting system that could have allowed an outside party to access—and possibly tamper with—the results of the election.
The EC voted 4-3 in its meeting to decertify the previously released results of the election, spurring Seiler to resign in protest.
“I believe the current proceedings of the EC are frivolous, unwarranted, and not grounded in reality,” Seiler told The Crimson yesterday, “and therefore I have no interest in continuing to be a part of them.”
Two other EC members, Emily E. Osborne ’12 and Daniel P. Robinson ’10—who is also a member of the Crimson editorial board—announced their resignation shortly afterwards.
Although there is still a quorum of EC members remaining, Morris said that the EC does not plan to take any further action.
According to the bylaws of the EC, if no decision is made 120 hours after the close of the elections, responsibility for certifying the results of the election goes to the Executive Board of the UC.
Outgoing UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said yesterday that the UC will instead suspend its bylaws and put the vote to certify the election results to the entire council at the next UC General meeting. In an e-mail to the student body at 2:37 a.m. this morning, she appealed to students to respect the results of the election.
“Students have voted, and...have selected the next UC President and Vice-President,” she wrote.
Flores sought last night to distinguish the events surrounding the election from the operations of the Council more generally.
“I’m incredibly disappointed in our Election Commission and in its inability to stay free of campus politics,” she said. “This should not reflect the work of the UC. This reflects only our election process, and it is something that must immediately be reformed.”

Behind the confusion and controversy swirling around yesterday’s unresolved Undergraduate Council elections remains an e-mail sent last night from the UC president’s e-mail account bearing the signature of UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 suggesting that vice presidential candidate Eric N. Hysen ’11 may have had access to voting software.
The e-mail was one of the key flashpoints in a night that featured the decertification of the UC election results in response to concerns about vote-tampering and the subsequent resignation of three representatives of the seven-member election commission, which regulates the UC elections.
Though McLeod explicitly denied sending the e-mail, former Student Affairs Committee Chair Tamar Holoshitz ’10, who said she was involved in crafting the e-mail, told The Crimson at 4:30 this morning that McLeod did send the e-mail.
“She read it out loud four times,” Holoshitz said. “She clicked send.”
The e-mail, which was sent to the UC’s open e-mail list, stated that Hysen may have been able to log in to the software that tracks the results of UC elections after receiving the necessary passwords from former UC Vice President Randall S. Sarafa ’09 upon Sarafa’s graduation.
The e-mail added that upon receiving the concern, former Election Commission Chair Brad A. Seiler ’10 had originally reassured EC members that they would all receive access to voting results in order to prevent any sort of tampering from going unnoticed. He failed to deliver on that assurance, the e-mail added.
It also stated that Hysen, prior to the election, had handled applications to the Election Commission, including that of Seiler.
Less than an hour later, McLeod sent out another e-mail from her personal e-mail account in which she denied drafting the much-discussed message.
In an interview with The Crimson early this morning, she said of the e-mail, “It was an inappropriate use of Eric Hysen’s and my name, and it should be completely disregarded.”
She added that she believed that John F. Bowman ’11 and Hysen—the winners of the election according to the decertified figures released by the Commission—took the top spot “fairly and honestly.”
Holoshitz said this morning that she stood behind the allegations presented in the original e-mail apparently signed by McLeod.
“Everything in that e-mail was factual,” she said.
McLeod could not be reached to comment on Holoshitz’s claims early this morning.
Hysen characterized the controversial e-mail as a personal attack and flatly denied any impropriety.
“The idea that I would, after spending three years on the UC, spending as much time as I have working to improve the institution that is the UC, tamper with the results is so ridiculous,” Hysen said.
Seiler, who resigned in protest of the decertification, said he remained confident that the election results were not compromised.
Seiler admitted that it was hypothetically possible for Hysen to have accessed and changed the database containing the votes, but he said that two separate mechanisms logging activity on the database showed that the database had not been tampered with.
Sarafa, who worked with the database last year, said that Hysen could not have changed the outcome even if he had access.
“It is nearly impossible to in any way use the software to alter the results of the election,” Sarafa said. “I’m sure that the candidates know that campaigning is a more efficient way of using their time than trying to manipulate the results of the elections.”

Ethnic Studies has joined the growing list of secondary fields available to students.
The Standing Committee on Ethnic Studies announced the creation of the new field yesterday, validating a years-long student-led campaign.
“This was basically 10, 20 years in the making,” said outgoing Undergraduate Council president Andrea R. Flores ’10, who called this the “happiest news of [her] UC presidency.”
The proposal first emerged last April as part of a key component of Flores’ agenda. It was finally approved Tuesday by a committee of 33 professors, lecturers, and deans.
“A lot of efforts of individual students...made this happen,” said Athena L.M. Lao ’12, one of the co-sponsors of the bill.  “I’m very grateful that I could be part of it.”
The UC’s original proposal stated that “the growing diversity of our campus, coupled with incidents of racially motivated intolerance in recent years, is evidence that more resources that help students understand different perspectives and life experience are sorely needed.”
The proposal offered a clear definition of the field: “Ethnic Studies is an interdisciplinary field that examines how people of color in the United States have historically experienced social and political institutions and how, as growing populations, they will continue to encounter life in the United States.”
The proposal also cited the urgent need for this particularly field of study. “The growing diversity of our campus, coupled with incidents of racially motivated intolerance in recent years, is evidence that more resources that help students understand different perspectives and life experience are sorely needed,” the proposal stated.
A number of General Education courses would count towards the secondary field. Many departmental courses—including government, sociology, and music—would also count.
Lecturer on History Denise Khor, a member of the Standing Committee on Ethnic Studies, said the new field will allow students “to ask questions that might not get asked in a particular discipline.”
Sometimes traditional “disciplinary boundaries can be more prohibitive than productive,” Khor added.
The establishment of Ethnic Studies as a secondary field is the culmination of much struggle and heated debate between concerned student groups including the Asian American Association and Native Americans at Harvard College and the administration.
In the midst of the recession, the new field represents an attempt by Harvard “to do, within the financial constraints, whatever we can to create more of an intellectual vibrancy,” said Professor of English Literature and of African and African American Studies Werner Sollors, who is also the chair of the Standing Committee on Ethnic Studies.
Flores, who hopes to graduate this year with a secondary field in Ethnic Studies, said she hopes the news is a precursor to further recognition for the field.
“We want a concentration,” Flores said, “but looking at what was feasible given the budgetary situation we are in, it seemed that secondary field was a good first step.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was no celebrity headliner, but last night’s trimmed down Harvard-Yale pep rally drew students to the Yard with its eclectic group of student performances.
In the midst of a recession and in the aftermath of last year’s failed Girl Talk concert, the College Events Board (CEB) decided to bring the focus back to students, said the group’s vice-chair, James A. McFadden ‘10.
“We’re getting back to the basics of what a pep rally should be,” McFadden said, explaining that the goal was to jump-start attendance by drawing friends and roommates of the student performers.
Rebecca J. Vitale ’10 agreed. “It was cool to have an artist last year, but it was a concert, not a pep rally,” she said.
And it was a concert cut short. After crowds squeezed up against the stage, Girl Talk’s performance was abruptly halted, and the entire event was largely viewed as a failure.
This year, the evening began with a lighthearted “chubby bulldog” contest, a spoof of the chubby bunny game, and continued with a “victory dance-off.”
Dance-off champion Scott J. Yim ’13 was enthused with his win. “It was quite possibly the most exhilarating moment of my life,” he said. “I have so much self-esteem now.”
The Harvard Band took the stage soon after, and the crowd sang along to catchy tunes like the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way” and Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline.”
The Glee Club, according to tradition, sang “10,000 Men of Harvard”; in an irreverent turn, this was followed by an electronic remix composed by Noam Hassenfeld ’12.
Highlights also included performances by the Black Men’s Forum—or, as emcee Tyler G. Hall ’11 accidentally termed them, the “Bosnian Men’s Forum”—and the cheerleading squad.
However, not everyone was thrilled with the production.
A low-set stage shielded much of the action on stage from view, to the dismay of many students.
Others in the crowd criticized the low-cost feel of the production.
“I feel like it’s the product of budget cuts. There’s no one here,” said Danielle F. Dejoy ’13.
Mee estimated that there were “slightly fewer” attendees this year compared to last year. But he said that considering the low budget and no celebrity performer, the event was a success.
“We did the best we could have with the funds we had, and we were really happy with the results,” Mee said. “I wouldn’t change a thing.”

The Harvard College chapter of Phi Beta Kappa notified 48 seniors of their induction into the academic honor society earlier this week.
After the registrar gives the chapter a list of students with the highest GPAs, the selection committee chooses new members based on faculty letters of recommendation, challenging courses, and “exceptional” academic breadth, according to History Professor Ann M. Blair, who is also president of Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter.
History and literature concentrator Charles R. Melvoin ’10—one of the 48 new inductees—said that he felt honored to be recognized for his academic pursuits.
“It especially means a lot to me because I engage in a lot of extracurriculars,” said Melvoin, who is also a Crimson magazine writer. “So it was nice to know that I could still participate in academics at a rigorous level, and not at the exclusion of other activities Harvard has to offer.”
He is currently writing his senior thesis on the first African-American to serve in the executive office of the White House—E. Frederic Morrow. Murrow was Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administrative officer for special projects.
East Asian studies concentrator Rachel A. Esplin ’09 said she was pleasantly surprised upon learning of her induction via e-mail on Monday.
“I was really excited. It was awesome,” Esplin said. “I think that the goals of PBK are to encourage not only good grades but academic rigor and variety, which are things I’ve tried to pursue.”
Esplin will graduate this winter after completing her thesis on the role of China in the World Trade Organization.
Twenty-four students are inducted into the society at the end of their junior year, 48 seniors are chosen at this time in November, and about 90 more are elected just before graduation.
According to Blair, there is no difference between the selection criteria used for the 24 juniors and 48 seniors. She added that the 24 juniors select four student representatives from their group to participate in electing the chapter’s senior members.
Harvard’s 48 new Phi Beta Kappa members will be officially inducted in a private ceremony on Tuesday, Dec. 1.

It’s Monday night and you’re a hungry college student with a near empty wallet and a yearning for more than Harvard University Dining Services can offer. What should you do? A quick glance at your iPhone may provide the answer. That is if you’re an early adopter of Rover, an award-winning iPhone application created by a team of five Harvard students.
Rover informs users of events, news, and deals in Harvard and Cambridge. Earlier this month Rover won AT&T’s Big Mobile on Campus Challenge, in which college students submit their designs for mobile applications.
The five students won a trip to the EduCause Annual Conference in Denver, mobile devices of their choice, and a $10,000 scholarship which they will split.
The application currently has about 1,500 active users and between 700 and 1,000 weekly uses.
Rover emerged from the combined  CS 50 projects of Alexander G. Bick ’10 and Winston X. Yan ’10. For his final project sophomore year, Bick made the Unofficial Guide to Harvard accessible by Smartphone. The following year, Yan expanded the application by incorporating the real-time “deals” feature. The application was later translated for the iPhone’s platform and became Rover.
Y. Joy Ding ’10, Drew F. Robb ’10, and Cameron N. Spickert ’10 joined the team in September.
Bick says the project began with the concept of putting Harvard Student Agencies’ Let’s Go guidebooks on the iPhone, starting with the Unofficial Guide to Harvard. Students can access the Guide’s contents through an interactive interface.
Michelle I. Brittingham, a senior marketing manager at AT&T and founder of the contest, said she had never seen anything like Rover’s ability to report back to merchants in real time, and that the application went “a couple steps above” the previous year’s winning application, which was created by a team of Stanford students.
She said that AT&T believes that the application is marketable and will probably partner with the Rover team.  Winning the contest will change the students’ lives, Brittingham said. Last year’s winning entry sold for $4 million, and she said believes that Rover has even more potential.
But until then Brittingham says, “I made them promise me one thing—that they finish school.”
Yan says that he stumbled upon the contest by chance and entered because Rover was already built and the contest was a natural fit.

Christina Hoff Sommers, an American author known for her controversial writings on feminism in modern culture,  called for a “new version of feminism” last night, igniting a vocal debate among audience members.
The former Clark University philosophy professor argued that the modern feminist theory—espoused by many liberal college campuses—fails to acknowledge innate behavior differences in men and women during the discussion hosted by True Love Revolution, the student advocacy group for premarital abstinence.
Today’s feminist movement, Sommers said, is dominated by a “hardcore wing of egalitarian tradition” that overemphasizes statistical equality and ignores a positive image of women as nurturing caretakers and mothers.
“Women want their rights, but they don’t want to be exactly like men,” Sommers said, adding that their brains are not “interchangeable” and that men and women have different preferences and propensities.
For example, Sommers observed that working women, even when presented with other options, still tend towards “caring professions,” such as nursing.
And Sommers argues that such femininity should be presented in a more positive light.
Sommers said that feminist thought, especially at many universities, focuses too heavily on bashing males and victimizing women, triggering a backlash among students.
“It’s ridiculous,” said Lauren D. Fortner, a Romance Languages and Literatures graduate student. “It’s not what’s going on—there are plenty of classes that talk about motherhood in a very interesting and laudatory way.”
Campus sex blogger Lena Chen ’09-’10 voiced similar objections, saying that Sommers had oversimplified current feminist theory. True Love Revolution co-president Rachel L. Wagley ’10 said she was not surprised Sommers’ speech sparked this debate.
“If nothing else, tonight’s talk stressed the idea that both sides have to be represented,” Wagley said.

Organizers of the proposed Student Community Center­, which would house space for student gatherings at the Democracy Center at 45 Mount Auburn Street­, met in Boylston Hall last night to present their plans on the center’s construction, design, and finances.
Joshua J. Nuni ’10, president of the  Student Community Center Foundation, said he anticipates the SCC will open in 2013 despite the need to raise 10 to 15 million dollars in order to begin construction, hire consultants and lawyers, and fund an endowment to maintain the center.
Nuni spoke to an audience of around ten last night, updating the attendees—most of whom were members of the SCCF—on its progress.
According to Nuni, only $5,025 has been raised to date. Seven-hundred dollars of that sum was raised over the summer by the Undergraduate Council, which turned over the controversial effort to create the center to the SCCF on Oct. 5.
Nuni said that by February the SCCF needs to raise “a few hundred thousand dollars more in pledges” for its short-term needs. These include developing fiscal legitimacy and paying for a staff of advisers and lawyers from the real estate law firm Goulston & Storrs, many of whom are currently working pro bono.
“We have a very clear idea of what our fundraising goals are in the short term, so we’re going to be reaching out to all the people we’ve talked about the idea who’ve blessed it,” he said.
Nuni said that the College administration has been tepid in their support for the endeavor despite strong student support.
“Our relationship with the administration is basically that I don’t think it’s been cemented yet,” he said. “We have an ideological blessing from them. They think what we’re doing is good, but I don’t think until we have more success that they’re willing to sign on to the project.”
About 1200 students have signed an online declaration of support for the SCCF, according to SCCF member Samuel A. Harrison ’10-’11.
Erica Adrienne Tsacoyeanes ’10, a member of the SCCF, said that the student support is what drives the SCCF.
“I think that the whole beauty of the SCCF is that it’s very grassroots,” she said. “I keep hearing that word over and over again, and I’m proud of that.”

In a panel discussion hosted by the Harvard College Women’s Center last night, three women with unique backgrounds in women’s health care engaged in an edgy dialogue with students.
In the discussion, entitled “Deviant Bodies,” panelists showcased their expertise in biological differences between sexes, health policy, and alternative birth methods, touching upon topics that ranged from the pressures women often feel to give birth in a hospital to the current controversy over mammogram coverage.
The panelists were Mary Ruggie, adjunct professor of public policy at the Kennedy School, Carole K. Hooven, a lecturer in anthropology and human evolutionary biology, and Mary Ellen Galante, a Cambridge-area midwife.
The experts welcomed inquiries from attendees, but they were the first to admit that they did not have all the answers to questions raised throughout the night’s discussion.
“I think it’s really important that students have a chance to not just hear or ask questions, but also engage in some kind of an exchange,” Ruggie said. “We’re constantly learning from each other.”
The panelists said that they hoped the discussion served more as an exercise in thinking about women’s issues with healthcare, as opposed to an event that sought to provide definitive answers.
“I hope that I can inspire people to be dispassionate investigators in terms of analyzing the data as it bears on questions such as sex differences and behavior,” said Hooven of her goals for the event.
According to Devin D. Smith, a senior at Lesley College who has been interning at the Center this semester and helped to organize the event, The Women’s Center wanted to bring the panelists together in an organized forum and use their “level of expertise” to encourage dialogue among students
The panel, held in Ticknor Lounge, attracted about 10 students, several of whom were females concentrating in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality.
“I feel that everyone should be informed and aware of different issues that are a part of communities that you might not be a part of,” said Jia Hui Lee ’12, one of the few males to attend the event. “As people who do not experience such an issue, knowing about them allows us to empathize and even be advocates for that issue.”

Only 30 percent of American adults who have tried to obtain the H1N1 influenza vaccine were actually able to receive it, according to a recent Harvard School of Public Health survey.
Moreover, just 34 percent of “high priority” individuals classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—such as pregnant mothers and health care providers—had received H1N1 vaccines by the time of the study.
The survey directors conducted a national poll between Oct. 30 and Nov. 1 to determine the prevalence of swine flu vaccine shortages and examine the opinions of adults who had tried to obtain the vaccination.
HSPH conducted the poll because “there were media reports about shortages” and the research team “also wanted to see how frustrated people were,” according to HSPH researcher and study co-director Gillian K. SteelFisher.
While the results may seem bleak, SteelFisher stressed that “it’s important to keep in mind that this poll was from two weeks ago,” and that “the experience has probably changed in the last two weeks.”
Approximately a third of respondents who had tried to obtain the vaccine and failed described themselves as “frustrated.” But 91 percent of respondents who had not been vaccinated said they would try again this year.
Harvard University Health Services has offered H1N1 vaccines only to select “high risk” individuals.
UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 emphasized that UHS was following the procedures prescribed by the CDC.
“We’ve been in touch with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and they’re getting supplies from the CDC,” he said.
Rosenthal added that UHS is trying to reduce swine flu risk by encouraging students, faculty, and staff to “continue to wash their hands frequently” and to follow the instructions on the UHS Web site.

Over 150 students marched and tore down a mock brick wall outside Massachusetts Hall yesterday to protest what they said were “fundamental gaps” in the University’s recent online statement of commitment to increase access to new health technologies in developing countries.
The protestors, members of the organization Say Yes to Drugs, which advocates for access rights to medicine in developing countries, said that the University should have a strategy for generic access for poor people in place before seeking patents for health technologies in countries like India and China, which have the capacity to produce cheap generic drugs.
“Harvard’s words about access are empty,” Krishna M. Prabhu ’11, a member of Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM), said at the rally.
However, according to Kevin Casey, Associate Vice President for Government, Community and Public Affairs, the University and Say Yes to Drugs share the same goals.
“Our response to those goals is most reflected in [what] we think they are the clearest and most progressive statements we have provided thus far,” Casey said.
Say Yes to Drugs has proposed that the University include students, public health experts, physicians, and patients in the process of deciding whether to patent medicines in other countries.
“Right now the voices for access aren’t in the room when Harvard makes decisions about who gets access to Harvard’s medical technologies and who doesn’t,” Prabhu said.
He said that these additional perspectives would be key to developing strategies to equitably balance access and incentives for innovation.
“We are not against patents,” said Sarah E. Sorscher, head of the Harvard Law School chapter of UAEM.
“We do not want to kill drug development. We just want to make sure Harvard medicines get to patients in poor countries,” she said.
The last speaker at the rally, Scott T. Gregg ’11, shared a personal story demonstrating the importance of access to drugs by comparing the fate of people in third world countries to the experiences of his father who suffered from a brain hemorrhage, and grandfather, who suffered from malaria respectively.
Gregg said he believed that many attendees at the rally had in some way been touched by disease.
“To be able to relate can help to illuminate the problem,” Gregg said.
At the closing, the group ran, cheering, into a strip of butcher paper painted to resemble a brick wall, representing the barriers to pharmaceutical access in developing countries that the rally hoped to break.

The report, published Nov. 10 in BMJ, a prestigious British medical journal, was a “meta-analysis,” which involves reconciling data from numerous past studies in order to form a general conclusion.
“It was very fulfilling to put something empirical on paper because this field has been fairly ideological in the past,” said Dr. S V Subramanian, an associate professor in the department of Society, Human Development, and Health at HSPH and one of the authors of the study.
Subramanian said he is hopeful that, after further research, the report’s conclusions can go beyond the realm of science to enter policy arena.
“If [income inequality] is indeed a risk factor, the natural implication should be that we should do something about it,” he said.
The study quantified income inequality using a statistical constant, the “Gini coefficient.” When the coefficient is 0, income is distributed equally across the population. As inequality increases, the coefficient approaches 1.
The report tentatively established 0.3 as a “threshold” coefficient after which income inequality causes deleterious effects on health.
“The important thing in this paper is the verification of the threshold effect, not the estimated numbers,” said Dr. Naoki Kondo, another author of the study.
The numbers presented are inherently estimations because of the differences between the studies analyzed, said Kondo, who is a professor at the University of Yamanashi in Japan.
“Now that we have seen a pattern,” Subramanian said, “we must find out whether the effect is causal.”
He provided two hypotheses that may explain the observed connection.
First, societies with larger income gaps may have policies that foster inequality in health care or education, which could adversely affect health, he said.
The second hypothesis, which Subramanian finds “more intriguing,” is that in unequal societies the “psychosocial stress” of competition may negatively impact cardiovascular health and the immune system.
Sociology Professor Dr. Jason Beckfield wrote in an email that the analysis in BMJ opens the door to further research.
“I think we need more evidence to derive clear implications for policy-makers, but the BMJ article helpfully points a way ahead to better science on this crucial question,” he wrote.

Youth involvement in politics and community service is the key to catalyzing change in government policy, according to Anthony Woods, a former U.S. Army captain and Kennedy School graduate who was honored with the Harvard College Democrats’ “Rising Star Award” in the Kirkland Junior Common Room last night.
During the discussion that followed, Woods spoke to students about how a desire to see political change motivated his personal foray into politics.
A West Point graduate who served two tours of duty in Iraq, Woods was discharged from the military last December after revealing his homosexuality to his superiors.
After becoming frustrated with what he saw as “fundamentally flawed” policies like “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and the government’s response to Hurricane Katrina, Woods decided to run for a seat in the U.S. Congress from California’s 10th district.
“It was jarring to go to New Orleans and see that the government failed miserably,” Woods said. “It was tough for me to realize that this was going on in our country.”
While Woods failed to win a seat in Congress, students at the event said his story was inspiring for young people interested in advocating progressive policies.
“He embodies the statement by [President] John F. Kennedy ’40, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,’” said Jonathan L. Newmark ’12, events coordinator for the Dems.
Woods also stressed the importance of political involvement at the grassroots level.
“Most people followed [my] campaign on Facebook, but how do you translate that into action on the ground?” he said. “You’re already following the campaign online. So get on the phone.”
Last night’s event was co-sponsored by the Harvard Dems, Queer Students and Allies, Black Students Association, and BlackOut.
Lange P. Luntao ’12, the Harvard Dems communications chair and a resident of the California district adjacent to Woods’s, said that Woods was an especially exciting speaker for him because his campaign garnered “lots of publicity about him in both local media and gay media.”
Woods, however, stressed that he found it refreshing to discover that scrutiny of his homosexuality was limited solely to the media.
“I was never asked once about my sexual orientation at a town hall,” he said. “More and more, people are going to care less about your sexual orientation. They’re going to care about solving problems.”
Overcoming the stigma against gays in the military will not be an easy process, Woods told the students, but “it’s the older people that are holding out.”
“The younger generation grew up watching Will and Grace,” he said. “They’re ready.”

Peter F. Zhu '11 will lead the newly-elected 137th Guard of The Harvard Crimson, the paper's outgoing president announced today.
Zhu, a government concentrator from Guilderland, N.Y. and a Cabot House resident, is a news writer and has covered University finances and Allston development.  He will assume the president's post at the beginning of January.
The paper's outgoing editors elected their successors early Friday morning, and the president of the 136th Guard, Maxwell L. Child '10, announced the results to the staff soon after.
"I am tremendously excited for the great steps forward the newest Guard will take," Child said Friday. "They are an amazingly talented and tenacious group of people, and I am confident they will serve as great leaders of the newspaper in the year ahead."
Zhu will be joined on the masthead by the managing editor-elect, Esther I. Yi '11, and the business manager-elect, Julian L. Bouma '11.
The Crimson, founded in 1873, is the only daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., and the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper. Its masthead will change appreciably next year, with the creation of The Crimson's two newest boards—blog and video.
The Crimson chooses its leaders through an election process known as "the turkey shoot," in which all outgoing executives are invited to participate.  A successful candidate must receive at least 75 percent of the vote.
Other newly-elected leaders include:
Lauren D. Kiel '11 and June Q. Wu '11, associate managing editors
Kevin P. Prior '11, associate business manager
Jeffrey W. Feldman '11 and Ryan J. Meehan '11, arts chairs
Michelle L. Quach '11, blog chair
Emma M. Benintende '11 and Daniela L. Nogueira '11, design chairs
Alix M. Olian '11 and Molly M. Strauss '11, editorial chairs
Tomo Lazovich '11 and Kent G. Rakip '11, information technology chairs
Hyung W. Kim '11 and D. Patrick Knoth '11, magazine chairs
Bora Fezga '11 and Halle K. Phillips '11, photography chairs
Max N. Brondfield '11 and Kate D. Leist '11, sports chairs
Sean B. Goller '12, video chair.

Those of us on The Crimson’s Sports Board feel the same way about Yale football coach Tom Williams as Boston Red Sox fans feel about the Yankees’ closer Mariano Rivera.
We hate the team, but we respect the man.
Really, it’s hard not to. Williams took over for the Bulldogs this year and brought with him a level of intensity and confidence that seemed to be lacking in the later stages of good ol’ Jack Siedlecki’s tenure.
It also doesn’t hurt that Williams is a hell of a quote: after Yale’s loss to eventual Ivy League champ Penn in Week 6, he told reporters, “We played with great intensity, we played with great violence, we played with great effort, but those things were not enough.”
You had me at “great violence.”
But with all due respect, Coach Williams, you were wrong about one thing...well, two things. In your first press conference at the helm of the Bulldogs, you said that your squad not only would reclaim the Ivy League title (at 2-4 in conference play, it’s not gonna happen), but would also beat Harvard for just the second time in nine years in the process.
“We’ve got to turn The Game back into a rivalry,” you explained. “It’s been a little one-sided.”
And this year, it’s going to stay that way.
I can’t think of one football-related reason why Yale should stand a chance in New Haven.
The Bulldogs boast a pretty formidable defense, but are much better against the pass—which Harvard avoids relying on at all costs—than the run—the Crimson’s bread and butter. Yale has no ground attack to speak of, and its two moderately talented quarterbacks, Patrick Witt and Brook Hart, are equal-opportunity passers, in that opposing defensive backs have as good a chance at catching their throws as the Bulldog receivers.
Harvard might have missed out on an Ivy-title threepeat after losing to Penn last week, but with a veteran offensive line paving the way for junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales to run amok, and with the Ancient Eight’s second-best run defense forcing either of Yale’s unreliable signal callers to take to the skies, the Crimson will walk away from this season with one of college sports’ greatest consolation prizes: winning The Game.
With that settled, I see no reason to resort to infantile character attacks on Yale’s football team, its students, or even the city of New Haven—always an easy target for Harvard supporters lacking proficiency in the art of the creative insult. Instead, I’d like to extend my gratitude in advance to various members of the Yale community for their generous hospitality.
First, I’d like to thank my worthy opponent in this battle of Ivy League sports columnists. Mr. Song, I’ve read some of your columns, and your knack for self-deprecating humor, stream of consciousness, and pop-culture references will surely result in a wonderful piece of prose valiantly written in support of a losing effort. Also, as Ivy League sports columnists, we’re probably both pushing our readership into double digits by publishing these pieces in two papers, so cheers to that.
I’d like to show my appreciation for the Bulldogs, who, by agreeing to play in this game, are kindly allowing the Crimson’s seniors to end their college careers on a high note.
Finally, I want to thank Yale and New Haven for their commitment to fighting discrimination against kegs and unnecessarily long tailgates. I can’t think of a better place to celebrate Harvard’s victory tomorrow.
In return, we Crimson faithful will do our best to fit in this weekend, although I admit it will be tough to match our hosts’ sense of shattered optimism and glazed-over looks of despair.
But cheer up, Elis. After all, it’s just The Game.

Second chances in life are hard to come by. For the Harvard men’s soccer team, that proved true yesterday. And now, a tougher challenge may lie ahead.
After a first round bye in the NCAA Tournament, the No. 9 Crimson will play No. 5 Monmouth University in the round of 32 Sunday afternoon at Ohiri Field. Yesterday, the Muhawks won a thrilling first round game over the University of Connecticut in penalty kicks to set up a date with Harvard. Monmouth’s victory will allow the Crimson to avoid a rematch with the Huskies, to whom it lost 4-0 in its worst defeat of the season on October 14.
“Mentally it might’ve been a tough game to play UConn after they beat us [but] on the flip side it would’ve been a chance for our guys to prove that that was a one-time thing,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “In some ways you want a chance to play a team a second time [but] on other hand you don’t want that mental baggage of a game earlier in the season hanging over you [because] it can provide motivation or worry.”
But playing Monmouth, which went 16-1-1 in the regular season, will not make things any easier on the Crimson. The Muhawks won the Northeast Conference Tournament title and their fifth straight regular season championship this past year. They’ve been ranked in the national top-10 for seven consecutive weeks. And they feature one of the best defenses in the country, leading the nation in shutout percentage—they’ve held 70% of their opponents, including UConn yesterday, scoreless—and rank second in the country in goals against average (0.35 per game) and save percentage (88.9%).
“We’ve played against stingy defenses before, so we kind of know what it’s like to be up against a good D,” co-captain Brian Grimm said. “Besides that, we’re just going to have to be patient and make the best of our opportunities.”
The game will feature a matchup between two of the country’s best players, Harvard senior forward Andre Akpan and Monmouth’s junior forward Ryan Kinne. Akpan, the Ivy League Player of the Year, had 11 goals and 28 points during the regular season. Kinne, the NEC player of the year, had 10 goals and 27 points.
The Crimson’s attack also features the Ivy League Rookie of the Year, Brian Rogers, the team’s second leading scorer with six regular-season goals. Rogers and Akpan will have possibly their toughest challenge of the year going up against the NEC’s defensive player of the year, senior Dan Bostock, and elite goalie Bryan Meredith.
“They’re a tough team to break down,” Clark said. “They work really hard...it’s going to be tough to find the back of the net.”
If Harvard struggles to score on this talented defense, the Crimson’s sophomore goalie Austin Harms and the rest of the defense will need to step up.
“We’ve been playing very well, our training the last few days has been extremely sharp,” Harms said. “I’m excited about the news that we’re playing Monmouth. I think that if we play our game, our big players step up, and everyone else contributes well, we’re going to come out with a win and make it to the next round...I’m feeling very confident.”
Fortunately for Harms, the defense in front of him isn’t too shabby. Senior Kwaku Nyamekye was named to the All-Ivy First Team while freshman Richard Smith made the Second Team. With such standout leaders, Clark believes that his defense can stop the Muhawks before they even take their shots at Harms.
“Our centerbacks will have to deal with crosses [because Monmouth is] very opportunistic,” Clark said. “[But] we should handle them when they step into our box.”
Despite its high ranking, Monmouth did not defeat a single team currently ranked in the NSCAA/Adidas Top 25 during the regular season. Whereas the Crimson was given the 10th seed in the Tournament, the Muhawks went in unseeded because of their easier schedule. But Grimm, who is from Monmouth County, won’t let his team underestimate its weekend opponent.
“They have a lot of talented players, [so] we’ll do our homework to make sure we know as much as we can,” he said.
Yesterday’s win marked Monmouth’s first NCAA Tournament victory in the program’s history. For Harvard, though, the second round will be familiar territory. The Crimson’s season came to an end last year in the round of 32, with a 2-1 defeat to South Florida.
“Last year we played a very good South Florida team, and we kind of learned what it takes to win a second-round game,” Grimm said. “We’re going to try to take that into this year’s game.”
Monmouth and Harvard have never played each other in soccer. If the Crimson is able to win, it would mark the first time since 1987 that the team has reached the sweet 16 of the Tournament.
“Our team knows we’ve played big games this year,” Harms said. “If you don’t win, you’re done. This is where great teams emerge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sucks.
In an informal poll of 3.5 people (one of the ladies polled was pregnant), 100 percent of people overwhelmingly agreed with that assessment. In fact, Harvard agreed with that assessment when Cantab fans held up red and white placards to spell “WE SUCK” in 2004.
Now Mr. Amor, before you get all Harvard on us and yell nerdy stuff like “unrepresentative sample” or “scoreboard” or “we’re better endowed (financially),” keep your knickerbockers on and listen. Just like MTV’s “My Super Sweet Sixteen” made your 16th birthday (where your dad unveiled a doorless 1988 Nissan Sentra as your wheels for the next two years before saying—in complete seriousness—“Pimpin’ ain’t easy”) feel worthless, your friendly neighborhood John Song will demolish Harvard’s already below-average self-esteem in a list of the top three reasons why Yale will prevail in The Game 2009.
1) The Game is played in New Haven this year.
Why does that make a difference? In response, I ask you, why did God give us puppies and young Britney Spears? Here’s a brief running diary of what I experienced last year in Cambridge:
10:30 a.m.: Wow, it’s really cold, and I’m indoors!
11:00 a.m.: My appendix is numb.
11:30 a.m.: Wait, there’s neither food NOR “refreshments” at this tailgate?!?!?!?!?!?
12:00 p.m.: It feels like a swarm of African killer bees conducted a violent mating ritual on my face in an attempt to escape the Cambridge chill.
I think you get the drift. By the end of that Game, I felt like Kanye West at a Taylor Swift concert, except the concert took place in the Arctic Circle and Kanye West was eaten by a polar bear.
You see, the Cantabs prey on bad feelings and depression like Santa Claus goes to town on a cookies ‘n’ milk buffet. The forecast for The Game 2009 is 56 degrees and sunny. Faced with all the smiles and happiness that a chipper town like The Have inspires, Harvard doesn’t stand a chance.
Harvard sucks.
2a) We don’t cheat.
At Yale, we have actual STUDENT-athletes, as well as recruiting standards. In other words, The New York Times didn’t write an exposé about us illegally recruiting athletes that didn’t meet admissions standards. You even rigged global warming to give us Ice Age-esque weather in Cambridge! Now, baseball is taking notes from you about cheating!
In a related story, Yale is still ahead in the all-time series 65–52–8. You’d have to cheat for another 14 years to overtake us, and we all know that cheaters never win.
2b) We play for keeps.
I did a little snoopin’ on the Interwebz, and apparently, Harvard’s athletic tradition dates back to 1780, when “a group of sophomores issued a challenge to members of the freshman class for a wrestling match. Afterward, the winners [were] treated to dinner by the vanquished.”
Wow, did the winners get to sit down at the dinner table first, too? Oh boy! Sophomoric wrestling followed by dinner, what a legacy!
Meanwhile, some dude named Walter Camp, class of 1880, a.k.a. the “Father of American Football,” invented college football and helped Yale win 18 national titles. Dinner’s on you, Cantabs.
Yeah, Harvard sucks.
3) We have a real mascot.
We are the Yale Bulldogs. You are the Harvard Crimson. Our mascot is a Bulldog, Handsome Dan. Your mascot is…a color? Who thought up that great idea? Probably the same guy who thought it would be a great idea to name an Ivy League school after the color of biological waste. I’m lookin’ at you, Brown.
Before the 1908 Game, Harvard coach Percy “Michael Vick” Haughton strangled a bulldog to death in the locker room to motivate his players. Even if we were as much of a collective bloodthirsty murderer as you, how would we even go about vanquishing a color? We can’t invent the black and white TV again.
And Mr. Amor, I know what you and the rest of the Cantabs are saying: “But we do have a mascot! He’s the pilgrim, John Harvard!”
Yeah, Harvard definitely sucks.
