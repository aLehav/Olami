After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Public Library’s central branch in Copley Square was designed by Charles Follen McKim as a “palace for the people.” Original sections of the library, which opened in 1895, include a grand marble staircase presided over by twin statues of reposing lions and paintings depicting the Muses of Inspiration; Bates Hall, a Hogwarts-esque room whose barrel-arched ceiling soars over countless rows of study desks; and an open courtyard ringed by Spanish columned walkways. In July 2016, the BPL unveiled the renovated Johnson Building, which substitutes marble and granite for glass, wood, and carpet. The Johnson wing’s walls are entirely glass, letting all the light of Boylston Street wash over the modern café, new bookshelves, and computer labs inside. Bostonians of all stripes frequent this beautiful place, far more of them than you might expect given the collective impression that anything associated with books is dead or dying.
Our own Widener is exclusive by nature and necessity. I can’t honestly complain: I don’t want to try studying while tourists mill around. But even for a registered Harvard student, Widener—like, let’s be fair, a lot of our institution—captures a certain restrictive ethos. You mostly go to Widener to do work that leads to your “qualification” in some set of skills. You use its resources in pursuit of knowledge that, even if that specific assignment is not intended to be groundbreaking, trains you in the tradition whose goal it is to produce original scholarship. In Widener and on campus in general, one cannot escape the sense of being educated, and that our learning methodically and relentlessly hones us toward a purposed specialization. Something would be wrong if we were to attend university and not feel that we were being educated. But I am wary of the sensation that our minds are being poured into channels through which they rush forward. Some narrow and accelerate to achieve laser-like breadth and power; some significantly shape the earth around them.
For me, this paradoxically engenders a certain helplessness regarding knowledge. Especially at Harvard, where so many people seem to be zooming at terminal velocity toward exact and long-established goals, it seems futile or even dangerous to stray out of your path. If I am not highly competent and unbearably passionate about a field, our learning (and comp) culture seems to convey, I might as well not spend any time on it at all. We should be experts, or we should be crushingly well-rounded, or we should be doing X-Y-Z with our education—we do it for a degree, or because it might lead to our being able to improve mankind, or because it might bring us wealth or power. Imperatives of every kind propel, direct, and restrict us. Oftentimes, they even ricochet us in contradictory directions, but they all demand motion and intent: all of it should be going toward something.
Life undeniably requires direction and action. There is, especially, a call more urgent than ever to retake knowledge and learning, to wield them with strong intent, and to concentrate our efforts where we can make the biggest impact. We must and should do this, especially when we have the fortune to be at a place like Harvard. Whenever I approach Widener or the Boston Public Library, I am always humbled and grateful to see them standing as physical bastions against what feels like an increasingly unintelligible world.
But McKim’s conception of the Boston Public Library serves as an important reminder that we can also relate to learning the way we relate to activities saved for after a long reading or a grueling problem set: not vocationally or authoritatively, without any sense of exclusion or obligation, simply as an open point of joy. Such a mindset is comforting for us to remember while caught in education’s logistical chaos, where it’s easy to establish a more jaded, harsher dichotomy between our vocational learning and recreational Snapchat, binge drinking, or whatever it is we feel the need to escape learning into. This spirit is also one of the most valuable things that we, as those with access to an intense learning environment and its expansive troves of knowledge, can diffuse within ourselves and among others.
You might ask, “Is this all a really long and pretentious way of saying we should read more? Are we supposed to spend every free moment with The New York Times or in a museum? Really?” But there’s no “should”—maybe only a hope that we can remove “should” from learning and knowledge more often and allow it a sense of luxury again.
Not everyone in the Boston Public Library is there to check out a book or furiously read. Some use the Internet on one of the new desktop computers, or talk over coffee. The library is a place of learning, a publicly funded and designated physical structure, that does not demand anything beyond its existence as that. Learning can be a space without expectation or connotation. Knowledge is power and responsibility, knowledge can be a means to an end, but knowledge is also McKim’s proverbial palace. We enter a palace and, if we can relinquish aspirations and burdens of mastery for a moment, feel pleasure surrounded by its steady joy and nobility.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout her confirmation hearings, then-nominee for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos confirmed her dearth of experience in public education as a student, teacher, administrator, or public official, demonstrating an utter lack of understanding of education policy. Yet on Tuesday, Feb. 7, DeVos was confirmed as the Trump administration’s Secretary of Education, following a 50-50 confirmation vote that allowed Vice President Michael Pence to cast the deciding vote in DeVos’ favor. This was the closest vote for a cabinet position in Senate history, suggesting that DeVos was so unqualified that even in a conservative Congress, two Republican Senators decided they could not vote for her.
Despite her lack of qualifications, we sincerely hope that Secretary DeVos will succeed, but we remain concerned about the policies she intends to implement. Indeed, DeVos’ confirmation will have a profound impact on our community through the future generations of Harvard students who will be the product of a public education system she shapes. We are particularly concerned by her indefatigable commitment to charter schools, illiteracy in measures of student achievement, and ignorance regarding student loans.
It is true that charter schools have been successful alternative options for students in areas with underfunded or underperforming public schools. We previously opined that raising Massachusetts’ charter schools cap would be beneficial to students, particularly those from minority and low-income families. However, DeVos’ dogmatic and one-size-fits-all commitment to charter schools is troubling, especially given that she does not acknowledge the failures along with the success stories. She advocated their spread in Michigan even though that state's charter schools have performed below the state average in reading and math.
This blindness to the performance of some charter schools is exacerbated by her illiteracy in the terms that measure school success and student achievement. In her hearing, DeVos failed to articulate the difference between "growth" and "proficiency", common terms used in education policy. Fundamentally, DeVos does not recognize why her commitment to all charters is problematic simply because she cannot  properly evaluate their successes. This lack of knowledge is a danger to schools and students across the country.
We are further troubled by the Secretary’s stance on issues that directly affect both the Harvard community and other American colleges. Foremost among these is her lack of experience with the management of student loans. When questioned during her confirmation hearing by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, DeVos admitted that she had not ever run a bank or taken out a student loan. This background is critical for a position that is responsible for overseeing government-issued student loans. As tuition costs continue to rise, college students need a competent Secretary of Education who can address these challenges. Furthermore, DeVos’ stated desire to move away from the Obama administration’s commitment to combat sexual assault on college campuses and potential stance against the enforcement of Title IX pose a further threat to students, especially victims of sexual assault.
From the Bush Administration’s No Child Left Behind initiative to the bipartisan support for the Common Core, Republicans have historically supported standardizing education. Even if Republicans decide to move towards school choice, all schools must be held accountable to common standards. As Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos must commit to understanding the integral facets of education policy, including her office’s role in managing student loans, evaluating school success, and measuring student achievement. Although the confirmation of DeVos marks a clear change in the direction of public education, the eradication of government regulation in education should not be her ultimate goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the autumn of 2015, Austin Mueller ’17 rode the Hershey railroad to a regional capital in Cuba. Originally the aristocracy’s train to the plantations, it’s now owned by the Cuban government. “On the way,” he explained, “there was an explosion; the train broke and almost derailed. Then, the conductor took off his conductor shirt, ran into the woods, and came back with his friend and a pickup truck, and they offered us a ride in front of the hotel, and they were offering us homemade rum. And what I noticed during the stop was how people were so selfless and willing to help: even if people knew nothing about engineering, they were asking what they could do.” Study abroad is like that - always moving in unexpected ways, but differently, more fluidly, than Harvard. A train stops, and people don’t grumble, but offer to help.
That same autumn in Morocco, I traveled from Rabat to Fez at dusk in a busy, crowded train where I met an engineer with no job prospects. The next day, we walked through the clamoring marketplace full of tourists, past camel-leather belts, hands of Fatima, meters of fabric, to the alleyway shop of a nomadic herbalist. A group of teenage boys offered me a flower, and I carried it past centuries-old buildings and pristine gardens with vacationing families and roses in every color. I returned from the trip by train, too, then walked back through the familiar streets of Rabat, colorful and glittering, dusty and full of cats, where I could disappear in the souk as if I belonged. I ate couscous with my host family; we talked, and we rested.
Ileana Riveron ’17 took boats with her eight-person classes, traveling to professor's houses on different Greek islands, places that they've since invited both her and her entire family to visit. She drove to the parliament, to the “weirdly Soviet-esque” Communist Party headquarters, to a general strike where someone was throwing tear gas, to a monastery in the mountains to meet with a nun. She walked to where the refugees came in, from boats she did not see, to the graffiti in Athens that said “welcome, refugees, you are home”, and was astonished by their resilience, pride, and humor.
Studying abroad is kinetic. “You wake up every day,” Riveron said, “with an excitement and awareness of the world. You have a different way of living: an awareness of people, situations, as if anything could become an adventure. To live that heightened experience, even for a while, is such a gift.”
If you know where to look, Harvard gives you thousands upon thousands of dollars, hands you the world, and tells you “Take. Taste. Make it your home (as much as you can).” And most Harvard students eventually go abroad for a summer, a winter, or a few weeks. But Ileana and Austin and I, unlike most Harvard students, studied abroad for a semester.
In some ways, the dearth of term-time study abroad makes sense. Harvard is a wonderful place, itself full of adventures—intellectual discoveries, hidden gardens, receptions with world-renowned guests. And it’s kinetic, too: even in the summer, Cambridge is in constant motion. But this motion can often be a stressful, non-reflective one. People walk with their heads down, checking emails; they take trains for the destinations, their next obligation and coffee spurring them forward. At its best, study abroad is moving to places that you never would’ve gone before, taking countryside trains to unknown destinations, and also having time to breathe. That’s what makes study abroad special: it’s kinetic, but it gives you time to stand still.
The final way Riveron chose to exemplify her adventures—which she specifically contrasted with Harvard—is telling: “I could go to a restaurant and had the time to drink a three year old glass of wine; and there I could sit, and journal, and process.” When you’re abroad, even as the new experiences flash by, you remember.
Being abroad is strange—so unlike Harvard!—you’re constantly moving, but also have time to stand still. You’re constantly meeting people, but you also have time to reflect on people, to form lifelong relationships. I’d like to capture this: the feeling of being on a bus along the Mediterranean, the difficulty of encountering human suffering, the restless, restful gift of being abroad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was four years old, my mother taught me how to read the Quran. We started with the Arabic alphabet. I remember learning how to sound out “alif,” the first letter in the word “Allah,” and “sheen,” the first letter of my own name. As I grew up, my mother taught me how to hold my hands in prayer, my father told me about the bravery and devotion of the first Muslims, my parents took me to the small mosque which would become like a second home to me.
I know my experiences are different. I cover my hair with a scarf. My holy scripture reads right to left. And I attend a mosque, not a church. But I also know that there is nothing extremist about this. My faith, too, has taught me the same basic morals: be kind, honest, and respectful.
It wasn’t until I grew older that I realized that, for some, my childhood and my identity are not just different but dangerous. In a post-9/11 world, the language I learned alongside English is associated with terrorism, my headscarf is just another symbol of my otherness, and the mosque where I made friends and played on swing sets is a sign of unwelcome Muslim infringement on American society. This was also when I realized that being Muslim was not enough―I had to brand myself as a “Moderate Muslim.”
I began to laugh my way out of terrorist jokes and remain calm through offensive accusations. I became overly apologetic and worried about how my mistakes could lead to generalization of negative Muslim stereotypes. At the time, this made sense. I could hear America call for “moderate Muslim” voices everywhere. It seemed like the clearest way to distinguish my peaceful beliefs from the warped ideology of those I saw on television.
Even my knowledge of Islam was impacted by my attempts to be moderate. Instead of pursuing my natural religious curiosity, I learned how to be on the defensive. Today, I can deliver speeches on the Islamic history of women’s rights and the meaning of the word jihad. I can explain how Islam values moderation in religious deeds. I can tell you that the Quran never prescribes the punishment of stoning, that the first university in the world was founded by a Muslim woman, and that the word “infidel” has no root in Muslim tradition.
However, in my vain attempts to be moderate I learned that a moderate Muslim is much more than “a Muslim who isn’t a terrorist.” A moderate Muslim is more “secular”―less overtly religious. A moderate Muslim must show blind patriotism and gratefulness to the United States despite bipartisan domestic and foreign policies that hurt Muslims around the world every single day. A moderate Muslim must constantly fit into the stereotype of “liberal, secular Muslim,” which is just as devoid of nuance as the stereotype of “dangerous, terrorist Muslim.” A moderate Muslim is allowed a limited amount of space by the media and by America. A moderate Muslim is small.
I am not a moderate Muslim. And I have no desire to be.
The qualifier of “moderate” suggests that there is something innately violent about Islam. It leads to the false conclusion that a small group of “moderates” is standing in opposition to a large swath of violent, ISIS-supporting radicals. This is simply not true because the reality is the complete opposite. When the media talks about “moderate Muslims”, they are perpetuating a dangerous  narrative of Islam as a violent religion that is at odds with American society.
The term “moderate Muslim” assumes that being Muslim isn’t enough. That being Muslim is threatening. It teaches Muslims to shrink from fighting for human rights and basic respect. It teaches us to associate our own faith and our own selves with violence, however false we may know the myth to be. It leaves us constantly condemning terrorism and places the burden of proof on us to reaffirm that we are peaceful, liberal, and good.
It’s exhausting, and limiting, and I’m done with it. I do not believe that it is my individual responsibility to constantly reaffirm my humanity. I do not believe it is my responsibility to reaffirm the humanity of billions of Muslims across the world.
My identity, like the identity of every single Muslim, is varied. Yes, I pray five times a day and Ramadan is my favorite time of year. But I also have an undying love for Beyoncé and a propensity for Netflix binging. I should not have to compromise either part of myself to deserve your respect.

Durba Mitra, a scholar of sexuality in South Asian history, will join the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality as its first full-time faculty member in the fall of 2017.
The Committee—currently comprised entirely of joint appointments between WGS and other departments—is also searching for a full-time senior faculty member to join the following year.

WGS Director of Undergraduate Studies Caroline Light called Mitra’s appointment “historic,” and said that small interdisciplinary committees like WGS tend not to hire their own faculty. Mitra comes to Harvard from Fordham University, where she was an assistant professor of history specializing in the effect of gender and sexuality on social and political thought in South Asia.
“What’s so exciting about this year is that the deans have recognized that WGS needs to grow–that we need more faculty, and that we are having difficulty staying afloat with just our very small faculty,” she said.
The appointment comes after an increase in demand for WGS classes in recent years and, according to Light, a shortage in faculty to teach them. Although joint appointments are “wonderful” because of their interdisciplinary nature, Light said, “the labor side of things” can be difficult.
“They end up splitting their energy and time between two departments, and it’s very, very difficult when you’re jointly appointed to get all that work done because both departments are making these demands on you all the time,” Light said.
While Mitra taught several courses in Fordham’s WGS program, she said that she is “really excited” about the opportunity to be a full-time WGS scholar.
“At the time when I was doing my Ph.D., very few people were doing Ph.D.s in women’s studies. I think it really says something about the nature of the field that Harvard is hiring me as a full-time professor in WGS. It’s really expanding,” she said.
Mitra will be teaching three undergraduate seminars in the next academic year: a history course for concentrators in the fall and the theory course for concentrators as well as an elective on sexuality and colonialism in the spring. They will all explore questions of race, colonialism, and sexuality in different parts of the world.
WGS is now in the midst of hiring a full-time senior faculty member. According to Light, WGS is looking for “leadership skills and administrative talent” in the senior hire.
“We really need someone who’s going to help lead this program forward with hopefully, one day, in the not-too-distant future, maybe that transition from program/committee to a real department,” she said.
Finalists for the senior position are expected to come to campus in late February or early March.

The Harvard Arab Students Association hosted a “teach-in” in Science Center B Wednesday to share legal advice with international students potentially impacted by President Donald J. Trump’s recent travel ban.
Panelists included Dennis Parker, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program; Shannon Al-Wakeel, executive director at the Muslim Justice League; Maureen Martin, director of immigration services at the Harvard International Office; Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director at the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee; and Khaled Beydoun, an associate law professor from the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law.
At the panel, Martin offered information from the International Office about the effect of the travel ban on undergraduates, and said Harvard has been doing what it can to support students from countries affected by the order.
“We’re seeing a palpable sense of fear in all of our international students, not just the ones from the seven countries named,” Martin said. “[There are] concerns about students whose parents might not be able to come to graduation… [and students] who might not be able to go home for the summer.”
Martin said Harvard is concerned about the effect the order will have on the upcoming admissions cycles, specifically whether fears that more countries may be added to the ban may deter some international students—uncertain that they will be able to travel freelyfrom coming to the United States for college.
In the wake of Trump’s order, several Harvard-affiliated researchers, including four Iranian researchers, were barred from re-entering the United States.
The travel ban has generated confusion and concern for many at Harvard. Beydoun attributed the uncertainty surrounding the travel restrictions to the manner in which the order was written, which he described as “very vague and ambiguous... which led to a lot of misinformation.”
Parker described the ACLU's effort to nullify the ban as a “struggle to make us live up to what we profess here in America.”

The famous red bullseye will hit Central Square March 8 when the popular retailer Target opens its first Cambridge location on Massachusetts Ave., just down the street from Harvard.
Currently, Target’s nearest locations are in Somerville, Watertown, and Fenway, so the Central store—about a mile from the Yard or one stop on the Red Line—will be more convenient for Harvard students and Cantabrigians.
Target spokesperson Kristy Welker wrote in an emailed statement that the store in Central, while three times smaller than its Somerville counterpart, will be two stories and stock all the essentials, including fresh groceries, cosmetics, technology items, and home products—all useful for the surrounding college students.
“Central Square was ideal for Target because of its proximity to Harvard and MIT, and its location in one of the densest urban neighborhoods in the Boston area,” Welker said. “The location is also close to mass transit, making it accessible to urban guests.”
Target enthusiast Tess Saperstein ’18 said she was excited to hear the news.
“I was dumbfounded. The excitement overwhelmed me,” Saperstein said. “I was in a daze for a few minutes because I was thinking only of the future and the beautiful possibilities that it will bring.”
Marissa Rodriguez ’19 said she was similarly thrilled. “I saw the signs in Central so I was very, very excited, and I thought to myself, ‘I don’t have to travel as far for Target.’ Yay!” she said.
Saperstein and Rodriguez said they both used to walk to the Somerville Target a mile and a half away from campus, so the Central Square location will be a welcome addition.
“When I saw that it was coming in March of this year, I was like, ‘Wow, truly someone is smiling down on me,’” Saperstein said. “Target is the greatest grocery store slash clothing provider slash furniture provider slash everything.”
Target will serve as an affordable outlet for groceries, clothes, and home items in an otherwise relatively expensive retail neighborhood. Low-cost food and nearby grocery stores in particular are difficult to find near the Square—the U.S. Department of Agriculture labels Harvard Square a “low access zone” due to the lack of groceries available nearby.
“I hope this makes getting off campus and shopping a little more accessible,” Rodriguez said. “Right now the only option is CVS, which is really expensive, but it’s because they’re convenient.”
Saperstein agreed. “I think something really great about this is the fact that Harvard students, including myself, would actually have access to fruit, which is very exciting,” she said. “I like the idea of being able to get groceries that aren’t as expensive as Broadway Market and aren’t as kind of suspicious as the ones in plastic containers at CVS.”

UPDATED: February 10, 2017 at 1:47 a.m.
Martin Shkreli, a business executive indicted for securities fraud who was once dubbed “the most hated man in America,” has accepted an invitation from the Harvard Financial Analysts Club to speak at Harvard on Wednesday, prompting some students to plan a protest of the event.
Shkreli said in an interview Tuesday that he plans to speak about his experience in financial investing and that the talk is “not going to be controversial.” Some students, however, are upset that such a polarizing figure will have a platform to speak on campus.
“I want to share some knowledge I’ve accrued over the years, some of the success I’ve had, and I’d like these events to go forward, even if there are hecklers and people who don’t like me. I can address that as well. But I’d like to do that in a reasonable and professional manner,” Shkreli said.
Shkreli gained widespread attention in 2015 when the company he formerly headed, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the U.S. marketing rights for the drug Daraprim, and increased its market cost from $13.50 to $750 per pill.
Shkreli, who said he had previously had events at Yale and Princeton cancelled, said he was “less concerned” about encountering resistance from students at Harvard.
“I have a high regard for the university, as most people do. I would expect, if there are any protests, ... at least calm protesters. Hopefully they attend the event and hear what I have to say. It might surprise them,” Shkreli said.
Katherine Qian ’20, has decided to protest the event rather than attend it. Qian said in an emailed statement that she is planning planning a protest of the event “in coalition with a number of student groups on campus.”
Ian  A. Askew ’19 also said he was concerned with Shkreli’s speaking appearance, saying he too would not attend the talk.
“I'm concerned about the kind of investing my peers plan to go into if they are interested in learning about his strategies and mindset. ” said Askew. “I am more concerned with holding HFAC accountable for this counterproductive programming.”
Student officers of the Harvard Financial Analysts Club did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Shkreli’s appearance.
In 2015, the FBI arrested Shkreli and indicted him on charges of securities fraud. In accordance with his bail agreement, Shkreli said he must request permission to travel outside of New York City before his June trial date. Shkreli made such a request this week in order to travel to Harvard.
Last month, several students and affiliates of the University of California, Davis protested an event in which Shkreli was scheduled to appear alongside right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos.
“Unlike my colleague, so to speak, Milo Yiannopoulos, I’m not a political activist. I’m not the vanguard for the right wing or for being a Republican,” Shkreli said. “I am here to give a speech about investing. It’s not going to be controversial.”
Yiannopoulos, an outspoken far-right political activist and writer for Breitbart News, recently made headlines when another event, this time at California’s Berkeley campus, was cancelled when protests turned violent. Shkreli said he disagrees with a number of Yiannopoulos’s views. Shkreli and Yiannopoulos have both been banned from Twitter for harassing women on the platform.
Qian cited both Shkreli’s actions in his pharmeceutical career and his behavior on Twitter as reasons for protesting.
“I think this is a really damaging event and that the Harvard platform shouldn’t be used to give someone like Shkreli legitimacy, space, and power.” Qian wrote.
Askew said the Harvard Financial Analysts Club should have invited a speaker other than Shkreli.  “There are too many people contributing positively to society to invite a celebrity villain to talk about himself at Harvard,” Askew said.
While the event was originally scheduled to take place in the Science Center, the event may be relocated, according to the event’s Facebook page.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a blizzard battered the Boston region Thursday, it was business as usual at the College, where students and staff trekked to campus in several inches of snow. While the University administration and several Harvard schools closed offices and cancelled classes, many College affiliates had no choice but to embrace the weather.
Historically, Harvard has rarely closed for snow days—only seven times in the last 39 years. During a 1977 winter storm, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III quipped that “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.” The most recent snow day was in Feb. 2015.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19 said that getting to classes had been difficult. He was also concerned about staff members who had to travel to campus from farther away.
“It was truly miserable, actually, walking from Dunster, where I live, to the Yard to class,” Freeland said. “I don’t support the University’s decision not to just do a blanket-wide cancelling of classes.”
Freeland, who also works part-time for the Harvard Foundation, added that he felt confused by the number of emails sent by administrators. Freeland said he was unsure about whether he needed to report to work.
“I wish the University had a more centralized system for notifying individuals about what is the game plan in an event such as inclement weather,” he said. “I think I was receiving emails from too many different people, and you weren’t always sure which was the one that was most definitive for you.”
Although University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp announced late Wednesday evening that non-critical University-level administrative offices would close, each school is given its own discretion whether to suspend operations.
“Though schedules at individual Harvard Schools may vary depending on local conditions, the University’s Administrative Offices will be closed Thursday,” Lapp wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates. “As always, faculty, students and staff should be guided by their School leadership, with whom they should be in touch with any questions. Individual schools with specific schedule alterations will communicate directly with their communities.”
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, however, remained open for normal operations and instructors were encouraged to communicate directly with students about cancelled classes. More than 100 lecture and section meetings were cancelled on Thursday, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke.
The Graduate School of Education, Kennedy School, Medical School, School of Public Health, and Extension School all cancelled classes, according to University spokesperson David J. Cameron. At noon, the Law School closed all offices and cancelled afternoon classes citing a “worsening forecast.”
Undergraduates revelled in the near-foot of snow and postponed prior engagements while sliding down the steps of Widener Library and throwing snowballs around campus.
Sammy N. Mehra ’17 said only one of his classes, Expository Writing 40: “Public Speaking Practicum,” was cancelled. He planned a snowball fight in the courtyard of Quincy House with a friend, anticipating that “at least there would be a lot of snow.”
“We both like playing in the snow, so we figured maybe invite some people together and get a communal snowball fight going,” Mehra said. “We made snow angels. That was fun.”
According to Cameron, undergraduate residential dining halls and shuttle services remained in full operation throughout Thursday, and Facilities Maintenance Operations’ snow removal efforts were expected to continue working overnight.
“All campus roadways and primary pedestrian pathways are continuing in full force,” Cameron wrote in an email. “FMO plans to continue snow removal through the evening and overnight period.”
Boston College, Boston University, Cambridge Public Schools, Massachusetts of Institute of Technology, and Tufts University, all cancelled at least some classes Thursday due to the weather. Boston Public Schools will be closed on Friday as winter storm “Niko” passes through the city.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Snowy weather cancelled a demonstration planned for Thursday against President Donald Trump's immigration order, prompting graduate student organizers to trade protest signs for phone lines and urge students to contact Congressional representatives about the order.
The protest, called “Academics United - No to Visa and Immigration Ban,” was scheduled for noon Thursday in the Science Center Plaza. The event was one of 51 “Academics United” protests on college campuses across the country. Scholars from Harvard, Boston University, M.I.T., and Tufts University planned to attend before it was cancelled.
“I wanted to support it because there are so many people affected here at Harvard and so many people across the country who are immigrants and refugees,” said one Harvard graduate student who helped organize the protest. “Because of executive orders like this, there’s a lot of fear and anxiety.”
After cancelling the protest, organizers posted on the event’s Facebook page asking invitees to call members of Congress to voice disapproval of Trump’s recent executive order, which suspends travel and immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. At least four Harvard affiliates were barred from entering the United States because of the order.
Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, another organizer of the event and a visiting fellow in Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies, estimated that around 200 of the approximately 700 people who were planning to protest lobbied their representatives.
“Academics pay a high price for it, especially the ones who have been living here for a few decades now and have a livelihood and have dual citizenship,” Jalaeipour said.
A group of five graduate students from the order’s targeted countries arranged the event. Although many organizers are Iranian, Dokhani said that the goal of the event was to “be in solidarity” with students from the seven countries that the executive order affected.
Although graduate students organized the rally, the Harvard College Iranian Association, an undergraduate group, helped publicize it. The group also urged its members to call their representatives once the event was cancelled.
“I’ve been calling my Senators as an Iranian American and saying this is a hugely misguided order,” said Cameron K. Khansarinia '18, Co-President of the group. “Protests are great and really show defiance, but that means nothing if people don’t call their representatives, don’t speak to their representatives, and don’t vote.”
The rally is not graduate students’ first attempt to organize against the Trump administration. Organizers of the planned Harvard rally also helped students circulate a petition opposing the executive order to prominent American academics. Currently, the petition has over 42,000 signatures from academics, including 62 Nobel Laureates.
Hours after Harvard students called members of Congress about Trump’s executive order, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to continue blocking the order. The stay passed against the order will remain in place, at least temporarily.
Organizers of the rally said that, even though the court upheld the stay, they would continue protesting the order. Describing the executive order, Jalaeipour said, “After 90 days, if Trump chooses to extend it, there will be a need for other rallies and collective resistance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will not relocate a Feb. 18 fundraising event hosted at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, but it will “avoid controversial venues that may distract from our focus on cancer care and research” in the future.
In a statement issued Thursday morning, President of Dana-Farber Laurie H. Glimcher and Board of Trustees Chairman Joshua Bekenstein responded to concerns raised by Harvard Medical School students about the location of the event.
Last week, thousands of people signed a petition calling on Dana-Farber to relocate this year’s fundraiser because of Trump’s executive order barring immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. At least four Harvard affiliates have not been able to enter the United States because of the order.
In the statement, the Dana-Farber leaders thanked patients, students and faculty for “their respectful and constructive concern.” Calling the controversy a “lightning rod,” Glimcher and Bekenstein wrote that cancelling the event “would also be seen as a political statement.”
“Our decision last year to continue to rent that facility for this long-standing fundraiser was never meant to be, and does not now intend to be, any type of political statement or endorsement of any political figure or policy position,” Glimcher and Bekenstein wrote.
Since 2011, Dana-Farber has paid the Trump Mar-a-Lago resort $150,000 each year to host its “Discovery Celebration” fundraiser in Florida. This year, the event is expected to raise $1,400,000, according to the science news site STAT.
While the petition organizers wrote in a statement that they were “happy” that Dana-Farber will relocate future events, they maintained that they were disappointed with Dana-Farber’s decision to host the fundraiser at Trump’s resort this year.
“Dana-Farber does not acknowledge the moral and ethical issues at stake with their decision to conduct business with Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Resort,” the organizers wrote.
Reiterating their wish to relocate, not cancel, the fundraiser, organizers noted that this will be the second Dana-Farber fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago since Trump’s first call for a “Muslim Ban” in December 2015.
“We urge them to consider what message they send when they say that their selection of this fundraiser venue, and their resistance to relocating it, is not a political act,” they wrote.
The statement announced that medical school students will hold a rally Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Harvard Medical School Quad to “reflect publicly” on the Dana-Farber controversy and Trump’s executive order.

Since Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2016, everything’s been busier at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program.
Staffed by attorneys and students at Harvard Law School, the clinic provides immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers legal support—a mission that has become all the more pressing under the Trump administration.
In January, Trump signed three executive orders related to immigrants and refugees, prompting widespread protest at Harvard and across the University and spurring a flurry of action at the clinic.
In just the last month, HIRC has helped the University file an amicus brief challenging Trump’s immigration order, organized a number of information sessions for immigrant students, and, most recently, released a report about the effect of Trump’s order on asylum seekers specifically.
The clinic has also hired a new staff attorney, Jason Corral, to work full-time to support undocumented students on campus, and hired clinical instructor Cindy Zapata to oversee the clinic’s expanded programs. Staffers at the clinic also helped pen an additional amicus brief opposing Trump's order.
In short, it’s been a hectic month.
Maggie J. Morgan ’04, a clinical and advocacy fellow overseeing students at the clinic, said that although it is still unclear how the executive orders will play out, there is already much to do to support clients.
“We just don’t know yet exactly how [the executive orders] will be implemented, but there’s been an enormous increase in activity in the clinic to respond to the threat posed by this administration,” Morgan said. “And there’s a lot of fear in the immigrant community, understandably so, so we’ve focused on reaching out to our clients and the immigrant community.”
As the University responds to a rapidly changing political environment and seeks to supports its international and undocumented students, HIRC has been central to its efforts.
“I think that it also gives people hope and a sense of comfort to know how many people are not just going to sit down and take whatever this administration throws at them,” Morgan said.
Rapid Response
As part of its  approach to immigration and refugee rights issues, the clinic, in conjunction with the Harvard Immigration Project—a student practice organization at the Law School—has launched the Immigration Response Initiative, an umbrella project with nine sub-projects. Among its other initiatives, members of the project have created a sanctuary campus toolkit and FAQ for students about the immigration executive order, according to Amy E. Volz, a Law School student and the co-president of HIP.
The University and Law School have stepped in to support the clinic's work. In her emails to Harvard affiliates since Trump's election, University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly pointed to the clinic as a resource for students.
“The fact that this was in late December, so really only six weeks after we started these initiatives, that [administrators] agreed to funding to hire a clinical instructor who would oversee these projects fulltime, which to me is a huge step," Volz said. It "says a lot about the kind of support that they’re willing to give to projects that students are interested in and where there’s need in the community.”
In an emailed statement, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow wrote that she was happy to support the clinic’s programs.
“I am so glad to have been able to add new resources for the clinic and grateful to the University also for contributing sources to support the critical work of the clinic and the many students and pro bono attorneys who have come together during this challenging time,” Minow wrote.
The clinic also released a report Wednesday called “The Impact of President Trump’s Executive Orders on Asylum Seekers,” written by staff and students affiliated with the clinic.
The report details prior policies and the changes made under Trump’s three immigration-related executive orders signed in January. Specifically, the report argues that the refugees are no longer safe in the United States, which complicates a refugee exchange agreement that the United States has with Canada.
The report has already gained significant traction in Canada, where legislators are considering suspending the refugee agreement, clinic director and Law School professor Deborah E. Anker said.
“We’re responding to requests from our Canadian colleagues to develop arguments about the safe third country agreement with Canada,” Anker said. “We’ve been very involved in this issue since 2004 when the agreement went into effect.”
Inside the Clinic
Like most clinics at the Law School, the clinic accepts Law School students through a lottery program that takes place one semester prior to joining the clinic.
Morgan said there was a significant uptick in interest in the clinic following Trump’s election and his subsequent executive orders on immigration and refugees.
Volz said that over 300 students have signed up to get involved with the programs.
“We have generally just received a ton of interest since the election, but it has certainly intensified in the last few weeks,” Volz said. “People will email us to see how they can get involved, and we’ve just been signing people up for initiative listservs in the hope that they can get involved in the project in the near future.”
While efforts related to litigation and legal research are mostly limited to Law School affiliates, other programs, like interpreting, are available to undergraduates, and Volz said they continue to encourage students to get involved.
Morgan said Law School students are essential to the clinic’s activities, and work directly representing clients in court.
“Students are critical to our work,” Morgan said. “We wouldn’t be able to do the work we do without student involvement and students in the clinic itself. They represent clients and they take a case, often times, from start to finished.”
According to Morgan, more local attorneys have also been interested in the clinic’s activities since the election. She also said the clinic has run a series of know-your-rights programs and clinics in the Boston area to help directly local individuals with immigration-related concerns.
Anker said many clients find the clinic on their own or are referred to its services by Greater Boston Legal Services, where the clinic has an office at its downtown location.
“They’ve been around for a hundred years and have developed strong ties with immigrant communities, so they refer cases to us. They also represent people, and we actually have a clinical instructor down at Greater Boston Legal Services,” Anker said.
Morgan said that while the student interest is encouraging, plenty of work remains.
“There’s been a whirlwind of harmful activity in the last several weeks, but there’s also been a lot of resistance that’s been quite successful so far and we hope that that continues,” Morgan said. “There is a lot of legal resistance and litigation that is being filed, and that will be filed in the future, to check [Trump's] abuse of his authority.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 10, 2017 at 9:36 p.m.
A recent blizzard and cold temperatures have proved challenging for Cambridge’s homeless population, with many struggling to find beds in local homeless shelters that have limited space.
Isobel W. Green ’17, an administrative director at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, said the shelter gives out blankets and hand warmers to people who do not get beds in the lottery. The shelter operates on a lottery system, in which directors randomly select people to stay throughout the night.
“We offer meals at the door, so starting at 8:30 p.m., people can come to our door and even if they don’t have a bed with us they can get dinner, they can get a blanket, they can get hand warmers,” Green said.
HSHS opened in the basement of the University Lutheran Church in 1983 to support the homeless during harsh Cambridge winters.
“Initially seen as a stopgap measure that would close after that first winter, the need for the shelter’s services unfortunately increased over the years,” a pamphlet advertising the shelter reads.
But despite the shelter’s long-time commitment to lodging the homeless, HSHS is often unable to accommodate all who need its services.
“I know a person who has been waiting for months to get in,” said Alistair Finlay, a homeless man from Scotland who currently resides in the Square. According to Finlay, it is rare to get housing at the shelter, which only has twenty-nine available beds.
Ana K. Chaves ’18, another of the shelter’s administrative directors, said that while  the shelter typically accepts only 24 guests per night, five extra beds are available under on cold winter nights such as Thursday’s winter storm, which brought nearly a foot of snow to Cambridge.
Chaves said that though HSHS would like to increase capacity, University Lutheran Church has certain rules that limit space to ensure guests’ safety.
At the youth homeless shelter Y2Y, which opened in fall 2015, 22 beds are offered through a lottery for 30-night spans and five for one-night stays. Unlike HSHS, Y2Y is “able to accommodate a good percentage” of homeless young people looking to stay, a member of Y2Y’s data collection team said last year.
While winter nights are difficult for Cambridge’s homeless population, chilly days are also challenging, according to Gail Bucher, the director of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter Corporation, an organization that raises funds for the Y2Y and HSHS.
After Au Bon Pain, a shop where employees were particularly kind to the homeless population, shut down a few years ago, the locals have had to find new haunts, Bucher said.. “Now people are hanging out near the subway and the Garage,” Bucher said. “Sometimes they’ll go to the Starbucks and the library.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting with the Class of 2020, English concentrators may be required to enroll in a course featuring authors “marginalized for historical reasons” if a motion submitted by the English faculty is approved next week.
The Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy, chaired by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, will hear the motion next week and vote on whether to approve it, according to Derek Miller, associate director of undergraduate studies for the English department.
English Department Chair James Simpson said authors counting for the requirement could have been “marginalized” due to issues including “racism, patriarchy, and heteronormativity.” While the department still has time to figure out what the new requirement will look like in practice, Simpson highlighted a few areas of potential study.

“The humanities actually have an immense opportunity here,” Simpson said. “Those courses could be in ethnic literature, or in courses where you have predominately women authors.”
The English department, which welcomed 49 new concentrators in the fall, would institute the new requirement for current freshmen who have not yet declared concentrations. The requirement would not create any new courses, but will instead highlight existing courses, according to Miller.
“There’s no class. That’s one of the things that’s different from our other requirements,” Miller said. “Courses will be decided on a semester-by-semester basis.”
The path to a full vote before the English faculty was a lengthy process that began with student proposals, according to Miller.
“We received a letter from some undergraduates about this, and it was brought then to our student advisory committee first,” he said. “It was really a full process that really involved people across the system.”
The new requirement comes as some students and faculty ramp up efforts to create a more diverse curriculum for undergraduates. In 2015, a College Diversity Report recommended expanding the number of courses that cover diversity and flagging those courses so students more easily find them when searching for courses online.
Last month, several students advocating for a new ethnic studies program met during a Wintersession seminar to discuss strategies for shoring up support this semester.

Though Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker was rooting for the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI, when seeing the Atlanta Falcons final quarter collapse, he couldn’t help but think of his own team just a day before.
While the Crimson never had a lead over Princeton equivalent to the 28-3 margin the Falcons put up, Amaker’s team played themselves into a game that was theirs to lose. And lose it, they did.
“It’s amazing for the Pats, but then the Falcons—how do you get over that?” Amaker said. “It’s the only thing that’s starting to make me feel a little bit better about our game. That’s probably worse. I know it’s worse.”
Several little mistakes put the Tigers in a position to regain the lead in the waning seconds, but Princeton guard Steven Cook capped the night off with a layup off of an offensive rebound with 2.9 seconds on the clock to give his team a 57-56 win. Unlike the Falcons, however, Amaker’s team gets a chance to put the game in the past and play again.
“As we found out after the Princeton game, the sun still comes up,” Amaker added. “Life goes on. Onward and upward hopefully.”
This weekend, Harvard (12-7, 4-2 Ivy League) hits the road to face Brown  (11-11, 2-4) on Friday night and Yale (13-6, 5-1) on Saturday in search of its first Ivy weekend sweep.
It has been tough going recently for Harvard athletics against Yale. During the 2015-2016 season, the men’s basketball team lost both matchups against Yale, who eventually claimed the Ivy League Title—the first time in six years that the banner had not ended up in Cambridge. On the ice, men’s hockey is 0-1-2 in its last three meetings with the Bulldogs. No loss stung as much as The Game, however, when Yale stole a win from Harvard football for the first time in 10 years.
But for senior co-captain Siyani Chambers, Saturday night’s game will be the first time he has faced the New Haven foes since he and the 2014-2015 squad defeated Yale in a one-game playoff for the Ivy League’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.
With a trip to March Madness on the line, then junior co-captain Chambers was on the floor for 38 minutes, tallying seven points and four assists in Harvard’s eventual 53-51 win.
But when Chambers takes the floor this time against Yale, he will be among very different faces. Of Harvard’s 20-player roster, only seniors Zena Edosomwan and co-captain Corbin Miller played in the Ivy League playoff in 2015, and four others were also on the roster.
Yale has also changed from the roster that won the Ivy title. After graduating Ivy Player of the Year Justin Sears and All-Ivy First Team forward Brandon Sherrod, and losing junior guard Makai Mason to a season ending injury, Bulldogs coach James Jones has had to look to younger players such as freshmen Miye Oni—who leads the team in points and rebounds per game with 13.2 and 7.2, respectively— and Jordan Bruner, who ranks second in the Ivy League in field goal percentage just behind the Crimson’s Chris Lewis.
In addition to threatening personnel, Yale has been lights out in its home gym, Lee Amphitheater, going two years without a home loss. But for Chambers, his mind is first on the team’s trip to Providence.
“Going to Yale is always a big one for us because it’s a rivalry game, but we can’t look past Brown,” Chambers said. “They are a really good team and they are doing some really good things. Like every other weekend in the Ivy League, it’s a really big weekend.”
The Bears are led by senior Steven Spieth, who ranks third in the Ancient Eight with 16.2 points per game. Playing the four position, but with range, Spieth provides matchup problems for opponents.
Harvard has done well in stopping the stretch-four player in Ivy play this year, preventing Dartmouth’s Evan Boudreaux and Penn’s A.J. Brodeur from getting in a scoring rhythm.
The Bears currently hold the top-scoring offense in the Ancient Eight, while the Crimson has tended to lag out of the gates and find itself playing from behind.
The team avoided the slow start against Princeton, and will need to do so again when facing Brown’s high-powered offense.
“We just have to get down to basics and fundamentals,” Chambers said. “Defensively [we’re] trying to lock in, trying to correct some of the mistakes that were made last game so they don’t happen again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some of my fondest memories of growing up are playing sports with my two younger brothers. While teaming up with them against our neighbors or cousins in street hockey, basketball, and wiffle ball was a thrill, I think I derived even more joy from being able to count on a win when I played against them in various backyard sports, oftentimes with rules that I made up, for much of my adolescent life.
Like all good things, using the fact that I was further along developmentally to teach the youth a lesson eventually did catch up with me. Those two-handed dunks on the hoop in our bedroom began being blocked and those wiffle balls that I promised I wasn’t throwing my hardest eventually began landing in our neighbor’s creek. While my middle brother is playing club baseball in college and the other is a two-sport high school athlete, I’m writing from a glorified fallout shelter contemplating whether I should run off my most recent Felipe’s burrito. But I swear it wasn’t always this way.
The Brown men’s basketball team knows a thing or two about what it’s like to be a little brother. In recent years, the Bears have received worse treatment from Harvard than even nine-year-old me could have imagined giving my brothers.
In fact, since Tommy Amaker took over in 2007, the Crimson is 15-3 against the Bears, its best record against any Ivy League opponent. Part of the reason why Brown may be so good at playing the role of Harvard’s younger brother is because it almost exclusively recruits players who are already used to doing it. Brown coach Mike Martin probably has the top roster in the nation when it comes to players living in their older brothers’ shadows.
Steven Spieth has all the ingredients to be a successful Ivy League small forward—he’s 6’6”, is a lethal three-point shooter, and is an above-average rebounder. However, the Jesuit-educated Spieth will always be known as the younger brother of 2015 PGA Tour Player of the Year Jordan Spieth. The Bears’ leading scorer could score 64 points in tonight’s game and it would immediately bring me back to the 64 his older brother shot at Augusta in 2015.
Joshua Howard is a key piece in Martin’s freshman recruiting class. The most famous person in Howard’s family is his father, Juwan, an NBA All-Star, two-time NBA Champion, and member of Michigan’s Fab Five, but his older brother, Juwan Jr., is no slouch.
Juwan Howard, Jr. averaged 17.8 points per game over his final two seasons at the University of Detroit and played on the Miami Heat’s summer league team two summers ago.
While Brown sophomore guard Obi Okolie presumably has big feet, he’s going to need them because of the legacy left by his older brother, Agunwa (Harvard ’16), last season’s Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year. The elder Okolie posted a perfect 8-0 record against the Bears in his four-year career with the Crimson.
Sophomore guard Chris Sullivan is the shortest of a trio of brothers who have all played at Brown. Like many players for the Bears, Chris has had a less illustrious career than those of his siblings. His older brothers, Peter and Matthew, were both 1,000-point scorers in college. Chris only needs 942 more points to make it into the exclusive club.
While Brown junior guard Patrick Triplett does not in fact have two twin brothers, if he did, one would probably be an Olympic skier and the other would have just won a championship with the Cavaliers.
A starting five composed of Jordan Spieth, Juwan Howard, Jr., the two oldest Sullivan brothers, and Agunwa Okolie could not only handily defeat this year’s Dartmouth team but would also be my pick to bring home a Ryder Cup crowd.
In addition to recruiting players with famous older brothers, Martin is fond of bringing players he sees as versatile into the fold. He described three of his underclassmen with that adjective in this year’s media guide.
Claiming that a 6’1” point guard who is shooting 30.6 percent from three and has more turnovers and personal fouls than he does assists is versatile is like trying to make the same argument about Meek Mill.
As an aside, I love Meek—he shot the music video for Ima Boss outside of my high school and is a fixture at Sixers game—but sometimes Dreamchasers can feel like one 70-minute song.
When he arrived on campus in the fall of 2015, sophomore forward Travis Fuller stated that the reason he chose Brown was “to win a championship.” While his ambitions may be a tad unrealistic, there is no denying that the Bears are better than they have been in quite some time and that Martin has his alma mater on the right track.
Brown accounted for two of Harvard’s six Ivy League wins last year and went 3-11 in conference play last season. The Bears already have two conference wins this year and blew out a Holy Cross team that handed the Crimson a home loss earlier in the season.
To see how far Brown has come in a year, one only has to look at the decreased load that senior guard Tavon Blackmon has had to shoulder since four freshmen arrived in Providence this fall.
Blackmon was a do-everything guard for Martin last season, averaging 13.3 points and 5.5 assists in 34.4 minutes per game last year. The Gonzaga College High School graduate averaged 18 points when facing Harvard in two games last season.
Blackmon is still a key piece for the 2016-2017 Bears but other players have stepped up. Spieth is averaging 16.2 points per game and seven players are averaging more than 7.5 points per game.
Five underclassmen log at least 14 minutes a game for Martin. The Bears enter Friday’s contest with an 11-11 record and has allowed exactly the same number of points as they have scored. The last time Brown was above .500 before this season was when the team was 9-8 on Jan. 12, 2015.
Friday’s contest largely feels like a trap game for the Crimson for several reasons. First, the Bears are easy to overlook from a historical point of view. The last time that Brown beat Harvard, the Crimson’s leading scorer, freshman guard Bryce Aiken, was in fifth grade.
To add to the distractions, the game is on the road exactly 24 hours before one of the Crimson’s most important games of the season. Saturday’s contest comes against Yale, the team’s biggest rival, and the only Ancient Eight foe that beat Harvard twice last season.
The Crimson has not won both games of a road Ivy League weekend since Harvard beat the Bears and Bulldogs over two years ago.
Sophomore guard Corey Johnson often alludes to how important it is for the young Crimson team to play a full 40 minutes. Harvard has yet to do so in an Ivy League contest in 2017. The Crimson has found itself trailing at halftime in each of its last five games and has faced double-digit deficits in its last four. Harvard has to make sure that it is not trying to beat Yale before the team bus pulls into New Haven since Brown is 9-4 in games it is leading at halftime.
Finally, early February is prime upset season. Four of the nation’s top ten teams have lost since the calendar flipped. Princeton and Yale are the only Ivy League teams who bring perfect February records into the month’s second weekend.
While this year’s Crimson team will largely be remembered for how it fares against the Bulldogs, Tigers, and in the Ivy League Tournament, it needs to beat the Bears for those moments to matter.
Losing to Princeton in heartbreaking fashion last Saturday could be exactly the wake-up call that Harvard needs to avoid a slow start this weekend. We will learn a lot about the Crimson this weekend. We will learn whether it takes last Saturday’s loss as motivation to bulldoze the Bears or as an excuse for a slow start. We will learn how this young roster prepares for a weekend in which Saturday is a rivalry game and potential Ivy League Tournament matchup while the night before is projected as a mere formality. Ultimately, we will learn how fast Harvard’s little brother is growing up.
Now to the picks:
HARVARD AT BROWN
Perhaps I was a bit too harsh on Brown the last time around—sure it was blown out by nearly fifty the last time it reached the NCAA Tournament, but the past is in the past. We like to focus on the present here at The Crimson.
A recent article from The Brown Daily Herald—perhaps Providence’s most esteemed news source—suggests the university is at odds with itself, arguing that the growth of its graduate schools “Puts Brown’s Identity Into Question.” Tough stuff right there. I think this is also applicable to the school’s basketball team. The Bears are a team whose identity is largely “Our Small Forward is Jordan Spieth’s brother.”
When the program can move past this, maybe it can get past Harvard, too.
Pick: Harvard
COLUMBIA AT PENN
During the American Revolution, Pennsylvania’s Quakers found themselves at odds. As their pledge to nonviolence conflicted with the ongoing fighting all around, they instead found peaceful ways to support the ongoing revolution.
Wikipedia—America’s most esteemed news source—notes that the Quakers “participated in the revolutionary movement through nonviolent actions such as embargoes and other economic protests.”
The Quakers of 2017 have a lot in common with their ancestors. They’re a bunch of really passive guys watching a season of Ivy League basketball fly by before their eyes. Sitting at 0-5 in conference, maybe Penn should consider changing its mascot.
Pick: Columbia
CORNELL AT PRINCETON
In a surprising turn of events, Cornell gave Yale a run for its money last weekend. In a game that saw a ridiculous 18 lead changes and two teams from some of the worst places in America face off, it was ultimately the Bulldogs that came out on top. Similarly, Harvard found a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory against Princeton, so the Tigers come into this one without a conference loss.
Personally I’d love to call an upset here. I think orange and black make for a hideous combination of colors, but you have to hand it to the Tigers. They lost a First Team All-Ivy pick in senior Henry Caruso but have kept rolling.
Despite a nearly embarrassing loss to Dartmouth last Friday, they’re still the conference favorites.
Pick: Princeton
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
It finally happened. No, Penn didn’t finally snag a conference win, but because of that, Dartmouth did. That’s just kind of what happens when you put two winless teams against one another.
Perhaps more importantly, though, Dartmouth is now a year removed from its historic hard alcohol ban. The Dartmouth—a news source whose only claim to fame is that it’s really old—suggests, “80 percent indicated that they do not think the hard alcohol ban has been successful in lowering high-risk drinking on campus.”
What a shame. I know most seasons of Dartmouth basketball are pretty unbearable, but trying to get through them with just a beer has probably been even worse.
Cheers to a dry Hanover and maybe next year.
Pick: Yale
COLUMBIA AT PRINCETON
I know people can go on for hours about how anyone in the Ivy League can win on a given night. It’s true, but frankly the picks this week seem oddly easy. There are a bunch of teams with a lot of conference wins taking on a bunch teams with not a lot of conference wins.
Hope you followed that.
This game, however, isn’t particularly easy to call. Sure, Princeton is undefeated, but the Tigers have also shown that they’re beatable, particularly this past weekend against Harvard and Dartmouth.To find the answer to this dilemma I’ve looked to nature. Specifically, I just Googled “In a fight would a lion or a tiger win?”
While answers abound, I found a relatively credible source that suggests, “The contest of the lion against the tiger was a classic pairing, and the betting usually favored the tiger.  At the end of the 19th century, the Gaekwad of Baroda arranged a fight between a lion and tiger before an audience of thousands. The Gaekwad favored the lion, and as a result had to pay 37,000 rupees as the lion was mauled by the tiger.”
I’d prefer not to put any rupees on this one, but if I had to I guess, the tiger mauls the lion.
Pick: Princeton
DARTMOUTH AT BROWN
Having a degree of separation from Jordan Spieth has to be good for something.
Well either that or the Big Green comes into this one hot off their its conference victory of the season.
Just kidding. Let’s go with the Spieth thing.
Pick: Brown
HARVARD AT YALE
During the 133rd playing of The Game something particularly unexpected happened. No, I’m not talking about the strange mating ritual Yalies do at the end of the third quarter. I’m talking about the fact that Yale won. I don’t know the details, but I do know that it had been a while.
I’d like to think history doesn’t repeat itself.
Pick: Harvard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 4/5 Harvard men’s hockey team currently ranks third in the ECAC with only five conference games remaining on its schedule. Luckily for the Crimson, both frontrunners have to pay a visit to Cambridge by month’s end.
Of the league’s two top dogs, No. 6 Union (19-7-2, 12-3-1 ECAC) will be the first to drop by the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Tonight, just three days ahead of the highly anticipated Beanpot championship game, the Crimson (16-5-2, 11-4-2) will play host to the Dutchmen with the top spot in the conference up for grabs.
“They’re having a heck of a season,” senior Luke Esposito said. “That’s a good test for us.”
THE STAKES
Ranked sixth in the polls and seventh in the PairWise (two spots behind Harvard), Union enters Friday tied for first in the ECAC with No. 18 St. Lawrence and a point ahead of the Crimson—with a game in hand over both sides. Therefore, a win for the Dutchmen could all but eliminate Harvard from the race for the Cleary Cup, given to the team that finishes the regular season in first place within the ECAC.
Friday’s heavyweight bout marks the only game the Crimson will play this weekend—a consequence of the Beanpot final lying right around the corner. St. Lawrence will also play just one game—a Friday night tilt at Princeton—while Union will play two.
Given the circumstances, it’s unlikely Harvard will find itself atop the ECAC at the end of the weekend. But a victory over the Dutchmen would set up an arms race between the three sides over the season’s final two conference weekends.
Alternatively, if the Crimson falls on Friday, Harvard’s new goal would become securing one of the four first-round byes available for the ECAC tournament. The Crimson currently holds a two-point lead over fourth-place Cornell and a three-point lead over Quinnipiac, the first team on the outside of the 'bye zone' looking in.
CAST YOUR NET WIDE
Between the pipes, a battle of the back-ups could potentially be in store Friday night.
Harvard goaltender Merrick Madsen has played 96.7 percent of the Crimson’s minutes this season, but the junior suffered an injury in the final seconds of Harvard’s Beanpot semifinal victory over Northeastern on Monday. Madsen fell to the ice just before the final whistle sounded, and the Philadelphia Flyers prospect appeared as though he may have been favoring his right knee.
After the game, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 would only say that Madsen had tweaked his lower body. He also said that the injury didn’t appear to be anything major and that he didn’t expect his goalie to miss any extended period of time.
However, Madsen was noticeably absent from practice on Wednesday. When asked what he thought about the goaltender’s status at the start of practice, Donato said it was “hard to say.”
“I know we’re hopeful he’s going to be able to make steps to be healthy,” Donato said. “We certainly haven’t given up any hope that he’s going to be able to play this weekend.”
If the junior is unable to go on Friday, freshman Cameron Gornet would be in line to make his first collegiate start. Gornet has made 15 saves in two relief appearances so far this season.
A goaltender with more experience, junior Michael Lackey also took the ice for practice Wednesday, but he has yet to be cleared for game action. Lackey had some work done in the offseason to treat an injury, reportedly to his hip but officially undisclosed by the team. The Washington D.C. native was sidelined for the entire first half of the season, but he’s been practicing with the team for about a month now.
As for the visitors, Union starter Alex Sakellaropoulos has missed his team’s last two games after injuring himself late in a 4-3 loss at St. Lawrence on Jan. 28. According to The Daily Gazette, the senior was spotted wearing a brace on his left knee on Wednesday and continues to be out indefinitely.
Therefore, rather than the veteran who made 31 saves against Harvard in January, the Dutchmen could trot out sophomore Jake Kupsky, who holds a mediocre .885 save percentage and a 3.48 goals against average in six starts this season.
UNION LEADERS
Harvard will have its hands full with the nation’s fifth-best scoring offense (3.79 goals per game). Union’s top line includes two of the country’s top five scorers, captain Mike Vecchione and junior Spencer Foo, who have logged 48 and 46 points on the year, respectively.
That same duo combined for three points against the Crimson in Union's 2-1 victory at Messa Rink on Jan. 14. Foo assisted on a Sebastian Vidmar power-play goal that gave Union a 1-0 lead in the second, then lit the lamp in transition early in the third following a controversial non-call that helped set up the rush.
Last weekend in a weekend split with Cornell and Colgate, Vecchione scored three times and recorded an assist while Foo produced a goal and two helpers.

Dear Harvard Officials and Authors of the Winter Weather Alerts,
Since mid-day yesterday, you have made it your mission to toy with our fragile emotions, issuing a series of mixed-message emails regarding the winter weather and class schedules. In the first email you sent, which rolled in around 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, you admitted we could be getting up to 14 inches of snow and hit us with the cautious promise to “continue to monitor the development of this weather event.” We smugly smiled, thinking you were coyly playing hard-to-get but that your hyperbolic reference to the storm as a “weather EVENT” belied your true intention: to do us all a solid and cancel class.
At 9:30 p.m., as weather forecasts had not magically reversed, you reinforced the snowfall statistic and mentioned the likely impact of such downpour on morning and afternoon commutes. With such an ominous opener, we had faith. Yet much to our horror, the bolded text of your e-mail announced not a closure of the hallowed lecture halls, but of “the University’s Administrative Offices.” Would we actually have to start that pset we’d been putting off? Dust off that textbook sitting on our desks? Our class cancellation fate was yet to be decided and no, we were in no way reassured by your cryptic yoda-like exhortation to “be guided by [our] School leadership,” whatever the hell that meant.
Why did you keep our hopeful hearts in suspense for twenty-two more minutes only to circulate the Scrooge-like subject line “FAS Open, Classes as Scheduled” at 9:52 p.m.? And no, dropping in a “we understand that travel is expected to be difficult” did not soothe our betrayed souls, nor change the fact that travel is difficult in 14 inches of snow. While you did give faculty the chance to notify their supervisors if they simply couldn’t make it, you did not grant the same “latitude” to the poor Quadded students, or Freshmen that couldn’t snag a pair of Bean Boots this season.
While some of our sensible professors, to their credit, had the great sapience to cancel class and relieve us, some of us weren’t so lucky. We were amused to find the Harvard registrar has a Tumblr, but immediately disappointed if our classes weren’t on the cancelled list (and by his lack of aesthetic).
Our trust has been shattered. As of noon today, with conditions “deteriorating,” you again revised your stance, now encouraging “members of the community who have not yet started their commute to campus to please stay at home.” Okay, just because you asked nicely--and totally not because we planned on skipping class already--we’ll stay in bed.
Sincerely,

With the recent announcement that Target—everyone's favorite mega-convenience store—is swooping into Central Square soon, it's easy to forget that we still have two very functional branches of CVS right here at home. The best part? One of them is open 24/7.
Which CVS you choose to frequent and what you choose to buy, be it munchies or medicine, can indicate a lot about your impulse-control, maturity, and overall life choices. Check out where you fall on our tell-all CVS spectrum:
JFK CVS Vs. Mass Ave CVS
If you are confident and fearless, you’ll choose the big CVS on JFK street, proudly striding through its well lit aisles and waiting patiently in its often long lines.  If however, you choose the Mass Ave CVS pharmacy, you harbor far darker motivations. That location, with it’s shabby carpet, dingy walls, and distinctly malevolent odor is only frequented by those students making more covert purchases like cigarettes, condoms, or makeup to cover up a hickey.
What You Buy
With your path and purpose settled, you set your sights on your purchase.
Food
Late-night cravings most often draw you to the glowing red-lit threshold of CVS. You're either really responsible or flat out broke, as most of us are, meaning you're hitting up the CVS aisles for cheaper food than the expensive fare offered by Square eateries. It is also possible that you’re merely drunk and either have forgotten about the fact that places like Felipe's and Nochs exist or are out past 4 a.m. and can no longer hit up El Jefe’s, making CVS your only choice.
Drinks
If you buy drinks, especially caffeinated ones late at night, you are of the Lamonster variety. Up late, cramming for that upcoming ec midterm while furiously consuming caffeine to keep yourself cognizant, you often exhibit signs of delirium such as as dilated pupils and incomprehensible muttering.
Toiletries
If you swing by CVS in the early hours of the morning buying toothbrushes, toothpaste, or other such necessities, you could fall in one of two categories. Overlapping with the inebriated munchie-buyer category, in your drunken stupor you could have easily forgotten that there are better times to buy an extra toothbrush than 3 a.m. on a Sunday morning. However, you could also be pitifully distracted and disorganized, running out to buy toilet paper or soap after discovering that you're out of both.
Medicine
Buying medicine and other normal responsible items late at night means you exhibit a level of maturity unheard of for the usual mess of a college student, who generally neglects their health and well-being. You’re thus either seriously weird or the kill-joy mom of your friend group, who won’t stop nagging the stubborn, careless rest of us. (No, we don’t need a tissue!)
Wherever your CVS run takes you this Friday night, happy shopping!
