After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As scaffolding comes down at parts of Adams House and students enjoy newly renovated Lowell and Winthrop Houses, River West residents await news on when reconstruction will reach their gates. Eliot and Kirkland Houses, after almost a century of housing College students following their first opening in 1931, are two of the last Houses in need of renewal. As an Eliotite, I worry about when my House will begin tearing down its walls and closing its historic dorms to students. But more than anything, I worry that Harvard will fail to prepare Eliot for the wrath of climate change to come.
Living on the Charles River is a cherished part of River West residency — we’re surrounded by history and close to views of rowers, kayakers, or perhaps even the occasional misguided swimmer. Yet we’re living in the calm before the storm. If climate change continues on its current course, Boston sea levels, compared to 2000 levels, are expected to rise by as much as a foot and a half by 2050, and as much as three feet by 2070. Eliot and Kirkland are situated right in the flood zones of the Charles — meaning that sometime in the next few decades, both River Houses are projected to be flooded, and perhaps even underwater.
For years, Eliot and Kirkland have been surveyed for reconstruction plans in preparation for rebuilding and renovation efforts. Before any construction plans are finalized, I urge the administration, building managers, and architects to prioritize floodwater response and rising river levels in their assessments. If Harvard fails to recognize this threat, it will pay the price later, both in the University budget and the well-being of future students. Naively believing that climate change will remain a far-away issue and that the river will be forever harmless will have long-term consequences. Harvard must be a model for strong climate preparedness across all academic institutions.
Sea levels are rising at an increasing rate as they approach our River West shores. As temperatures increase, ocean water warms and increases in volume in a process called thermal expansion. In Greenland, warmer summers cause the ice sheet to experience increased surface melting and ice mass loss, one of the greatest contributors to global sea level rise today. In Antarctica, West Antarctic glaciers are expected to flow into the ocean as ice shelves collapse from warming ocean water underneath, with the potential to significantly raise global sea levels on unpredictable timescales. Locally, sea level rise is also exacerbated by land sinking along coastlines, including the East Coast of the United States. This multitude of contributors to the sea level and the accelerated rate at which each is adding to the rise means responding swiftly is vital.
Concerningly, downplaying the severity of future climate threats is the norm for not only academic institutions, but organizations and governments everywhere. The United States is responsible for an alarming 24.6 percent of cumulative global emissions that have warmed the planet thus far. Yet it often feels as though our leaders still largely opt to maintain a blissfully ignorant view of the future when it comes to climate change response. Addressing climate change involves both reducing future emissions and preparing robust adaptation measures quickly — ignoring either has devastating consequences. At Harvard, adapting on campus means we cannot wait for water to pour into our dormitories before confronting rising sea levels. Now is the time to prepare, and Harvard should be leading the way.
Adapting to rising sea levels requires a multifaceted approach. One of the largest hurdles for our coastal community is being able to rapidly prepare our infrastructure, buildings, and residential communities. Researchers expect that extreme winter storms, bringing high tides and storm surges to Boston Harbor, will continue to be the greatest flooding risk to the city in the years to come. Experts have proposed the construction of a harbor barrier, but the implementation of this would require over $11.8 billion. In a September hearing for sea-level rise planning, Boston officials reached no coordinated consensus on how to begin addressing the issue, agreeing only that significant funds would be required.
While Harvard should encourage city leaders to implement barrier solutions in Boston Harbor, for now, Harvard must plan to protect riverside dorms like Eliot and Kirkland by prioritizing specific flood-safe design measures. This could include raising buildings higher above projected river levels, integrating flood greenspace like that used in the Science and Engineering Complex, ensuring electrical rooms and generators are located far above ground, making sure evacuation exits are in place if needed, and bringing in flood design experts.
Preparing for adaptation efforts, both on Harvard’s campus and in collaboration with local city governments, is essential as the Charles rises. Redesigning Eliot and Kirkland with sea level in mind during future renewal projects is a first step. The Harvard bubble will not be impermeable to floods forever, no matter how protected we may feel living within its gates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge’s new City Manager, Yi-An Huang ’05, began his term in September pledging to improve the working relationship between his office and the Cambridge City Council. Three months in, he knows the city has a ways to go.
In an interview last week, Huang touted improving the dynamic between the council and city staff and reemphasized his commitment to increasing accountability and transparency around government decision-making.
Cambridge’s government features both a democratically-elected city council, which sets policy goals and priorities, and a city manager, who oversees daily government operations, creates the nearly-billion-dollar city budget, and implements the council’s policy goals. The relationship between the two government bodies has been a source of tension in years past.
Huang, who was selected from four finalists for the position following a months-long search to replace former city manager Louis A. DePasquale, said that though he feels “the what of what the city does is fairly visible,” the same is less true for government decision-making.
Last week, Huang sent the Council an eight-page 90-day report, detailing “strengths and areas for growth” and “early thoughts on the direction and the important work ahead,” especially around themes of transparency and process.
“The decisions [city staff] make are public. We have discussions about what we’re going to do; people experience it as they live in the city,” Huang said in the interview. “I think this 90-day report was really a bit about how we show the how we do the work and the why we make decisions.”
Huang said that following a rare private summit between city staff and councilors in early October to improve communication and collaboration between the two government bodies, he felt a “renewed push” from councilors to further develop their working relationship together.
“There’s a desire to create the communication channels and trust that let us work together and collaborate — and also disagree on things yet still make decisions together,” Huang said. “That’s been really exciting.”
But the Council’s relationship with Huang has not been entirely without problems.
At a Dec. 5 meeting of the Council, some councilors said they felt blindsided by a late addition to the agenda from Huang asking the state Department of Conservation and Recreation to reopen Memorial Drive to vehicular traffic on Dec. 10 and 17. The closure of Memorial Drive for open space and recreation on Saturdays as well as Sundays has been a source of division among residents.
“I think the process by which is before us tonight is really broken, and it’s not a transparent way to communicate with the Council and the public,” Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said in the meeting. “It’s not a democratic way to move forward.”
Huang said in the interview that the closure was a “small accommodation” to address concerns of negative impacts from some residents along Memorial Drive, but its status in the new year would be a “separate conversation.”
“There’s definitely evidence from even [the Dec. 5 council meeting] where I think we weren’t able to provide the kind of advance notice on certain items that we are bringing to the Council that we would like to do in the longer term,” Huang said.
Huang said he hopes to deal with situations that tend to elicit resident disagreement, such as Memorial Drive closures or bike lane construction projects, by trying to “be okay sitting in that messiness” of diverse viewpoints.
“That’s actually the tension: how are we, a diverse community that isn’t going to agree on everything, going to stay unified as a community and believing that we are in this together?” Huang said. “How do we do that in the thick of actual issues?”
In the report, Huang committed to undergoing a yearly performance review, which he described as an “opportunity to learn and to grow and to get feedback.” He said his office would work with the Council in mid-February to set clear goals and measures for a review, which would be periodically revisited through the year and evaluated in a “more objective process” at the end of 2023.
“I think it’s actually a way to better clarify, ‘these are the really important things that we want to get done,’ and that I’ll be accountable to work with the Council on and work with the city leaders and staff on,” Huang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three years after Lorgia García Peña was denied tenure at Harvard — a decision that sparked backlash against the University’s tenure review process — the ethnic studies scholar has accepted a full professorship at Princeton University.
García Peña, a former associate professor of Romance Languages and Literature at Harvard, was denied tenure in late November 2019. More than 100 faculty members subsequently called for an examination of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ tenure process, prompting FAS Dean Claudine Gay to initiate a review in 2020.
The Tenure-Track Review Committee released its final report in October 2021, largely upholding the school’s tenure review process while acknowledging “mistrust and low morale” among junior faculty. The committee suggested several adjustments to clarify the process and called for further review of the University’s use of secretive ad hoc committees.
In March, Gay sent faculty an implementation plan for the recommendations outlined in the report. The plan features measures to increase faculty participation and improve communication between deans, candidates, and the review committees.
Since 2021, García Peña has served as a professor of Studies in Race, Colonialism, and Diaspora at Tufts University. Beginning July 1, she will move to Princeton’s Effron Center for the Study of America and the school’s Department of African American Studies.
Hired by Harvard in 2013, García Peña was the only Black Latina among the FAS’ tenure track faculty at the time. She helped create a secondary field in Latinx studies and collected numerous teaching awards.
In the weeks that followed her tenure denial, hundreds of students and ethnic studies scholars condemned the decision by staging a sit-in at University Hall, protesting in Harvard Yard, and writing letters to administrators. Protestors claimed the tenure denial contradicted the University’s efforts to promote ethnic studies at Harvard.
Jane Sujen Bock ’81 — a member of the Ethnic Studies Task Force of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an alumni group aiming to increase diversity at the University — highlighted García Peña’s scholarship, contributions to the field of ethnic studies, and passion for teaching in an email following news of García Peña’s appointment.
“Harvard’s failings are Princeton’s gain,” Bock wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven Harvard students were named Schwarzman scholars this year, granting them a one-year, fully-paid master's degree opportunity at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
The students selected for the prestigious scholarship include current College students Christian D. Abney ’23, Monica Chang ’23, Joyce Zhou ’23, Jonathan Zhuyuan Zhang ’23, College alum Kunho Kim ’17, Zayan Faiyad ’18, and Harvard Medical School student Claire Jiaqi Jiang.
The Schwarzman Scholarship aims to promote studies in global affairs and leadership development. This year, the program selected 143 students from various universities around the world.
Stephen A. Schwarzman, billionaire and co-founder of private equity firm Blackstone Group, created the program in 2016 after being inspired by the Rhodes scholarship.
Monica Chang ’23 said she was conducting interviews for her senior thesis when she received the call about her award.
“I saw that it was from someone from the Schwarzman Scholars. Either they're calling me to reject me over a phone call, which is very cruel,” she said. “Or maybe this is an acceptance, so I immediately called back and heard the news.”
“I was honestly very surprised and shocked, but also very grateful,” Chang added.
Jonathan Zhuyuan Zhang ’23 said he plans to “enrich and deepen” his bonds with friends and family after graduation and before going off to Beijing.
“Harvard expects a lot out of people, and not often enough do we give ourselves the time to take a step back to rest and recuperate and to relax,” he said. “This will be a time to truly reflect upon my time in Harvard the past four years, the amazing opportunities I've had, and I hope to be able to travel and enrich and deepen some of these bonds that I have with my friends currently.”
Graduating students will have the upcoming summer to themselves before their one-year commitment to Tsinghua University.
Christian D. Abney ’23, who plans to work in affordable housing development, said he applied to the Schwarzman Scholarship for its leadership development curriculum and geographical location.
“It would be beneficial for me to learn from other leaders and cultivate those relationships that would later allow me to succeed in sort of an entrepreneurial enterprise like I plan,” he said.
Abney said that China “offers a really interesting perspective” on affordable housing development.
“They've been the most successful country in lifting the most people out of poverty over a fairly rapid amount of time,” he added.
Kunho Kim ’17 said he applied to the program because he has always had an interest in studying East Asia.
“I am from Korea, but grew up in Vietnam and went to college in Boston,” he said. “I thought that it would be a great place to get to know more about Asia.”
“I actually thought about applying to Schwarzman [right] after college, but I didn't apply because I wanted to have some more experience,” he said. “I guess just getting back to the school mode, thinking-wise, was a little challenging because I've been out of school for six years now.”
Others said they knew right away that the Schwarzman Scholarship was the correct fit for them.
Claire Jiaqi Jiang, a Harvard Medical School student interested in responding to health disparities, said she knew the Schwarzman Scholarship was exactly what she wanted.
“I wouldn't say that any of it was super easy, except the fact that knowing that this is exactly what I want, and this would be very beneficial in terms of my future career plan,” she said.
“I was lacking a more comprehensive perspective, especially in perspective and politics, so I think the Schwarzman program is the perfect opportunity for me,” she added.
Joyce Zhou ’22-’23 wrote in an email that the program is important to bridge “complex global relationships.”
“The Schwarzman Scholarship cultivates a catalytic environment for collaboration,” she said. “To me, that means not only exploring the world's most pressing issues but also broadening my understanding of how people from diverse backgrounds can work together to solve them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — A former Harvard admissions officer told a federal jury on Friday that the school’s ex-fencing coach, Peter Brand, “made the difference” in the admissions outcomes of a wealthy Maryland businessman’s two sons.
Brand, who was fired by Harvard in 2019, is facing trial alongside telecommunications executive Jie “Jack” Zhao for allegedly accepting more than $1.5 million in bribes to get Zhao’s sons into Harvard College as fencing recruits.
Prosecutors say Brand accepted an array of kickbacks from Zhao in exchange for getting his sons into Harvard. As part of the alleged scheme, Zhao purchased Brand’s home at a premium, made college tuition payments for Brand’s son, and covered the cost of Brand’s new sports car.
During the fifth day of trial on Friday, former Harvard admissions officer David L. Evans, who retired in 2020, told jurors that he would have had reservations about admitting Zhao’s two sons — Eric Y. Zhao ’18 and Edward Y. Zhao ’21 — without Brand vouching for their fencing prowess.
Evans said Brand’s comments about Edward Zhao were “the clincher” in his admissions decision.
“It made the difference,” he told Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen E. Frank ’95.
When reviewing Eric Zhao’s application, Evans wrote that he “would have no objection” if his athletic talents were “truly special,” according to notes presented by prosecutors on Friday. “If not, I would pause,” he wrote in 2016 when reviewing the application.
Defense attorneys sought to show that Zhao’s two sons got into the College on their own merits, reading from their high school recommendation letters and comparing their grade point averages and test scores to the rest of their respective high school classes.
Zhao’s lawyer, William D. Weinreb, rattled off highlights from the notes of Edward Zhao’s 2016 interview with a Harvard admissions officer, who wrote Zhao “would be a great fit” at the College as “someone who could be friends with absolutely anyone.”
“This does sound like exactly the kind of student Harvard would want, right?” Weinreb asked.
“Yes,” Evans replied.
Jurors also heard on Friday from a Needham town employee who raised alarm when Zhao purchased Brand’s 1,364-square-foot home for almost twice its assessed value.
Chip Davis, the city’s former chief assessor, said the sale price was “very surprising.”
“Even if there’s a 5-10 percent change” between the assessed price and the sale price, “we go and inspect,” he said. “This was dramatically higher than that.”
After the sale, Davis said, he knocked on the door of Brand’s home for an in-person inspection. He found that the house’s condition suggested its value was “pretty close” to the 2015 assessed value of $549,300 — rather than the sale price of $989,500.
“I was standing on the porch at the door, hoping that the overhang over the porch didn’t fall because it looked a little shaky,” said Davis, who had assessed homes in Needham since 1992.
In his May 2016 notes, Davis was perplexed by the sale price, according to an exhibit shown to jurors Friday.
“Sold to buyer from Virginia for 990k??? Place is vintage 1960s in bad shape???” Davis wrote. “Makes no sense.”
In fall 2017, Zhao sold the home for $665,000, taking a 32 percent loss on the transaction. Davis returned for another visit triggered by the sale price. “Makes no sense,” he wrote again in his notes.
“Generally, when someone sells a house in Needham, they make a profit rather than take a huge loss,” Davis said on Friday.
Brand’s relationship with Zhao was first called into question when the Boston Globe published an investigation about the property sale in 2019.
Weinreb, Zhao’s attorney, suggested Zhao may not have known how to assess the house’s worth and noted property values in Needham change year to year.
“You don’t know [Zhao], do you? You certainly don’t know whether he knew how to look at a house and assess its condition,” Weinreb said to Davis.
After selling their Needham home to Zhao, Brand and his wife, Jacqueline Phillips, bought a condominium in Cambridge for $1.3 million in May 2016. Zhao helped pay for renovations to the new home, according to former S+H Construction President Douglas Hanna, who testified Friday afternoon.
The trial is set to resume at 9 a.m. on Tuesday.
Correction: December 13, 2022:
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Jie “Jack” Zhao purchased Peter Brand’s home in Needham for $980,500. In fact, the sale price was $989,500.

Sneha and J.J. heard about Annette and Raymond’s sleepover in Cabot Library and immediately knew it was a horrid idea. Still, they wanted to torture themselves (and test their all-nighter stamina) anyway, so they chose to follow in Annette and Raymond’s footsteps in a far superior library: Lamont. They had no plan, no room booked, no blanket, and no food; in other words, they were the most prepared they had ever been for a late night in Lamont.
Here’s a rough timeline of the night’s events:
4:30 p.m. — J.J. arrives at Lamont with her friend, Reuben L.S. Henry-Daire ’26, to study and steal a classroom. She is nervous because she and Sneha have never met before, and she’s not sure how the night is going to go/if Sneha is a weirdo. On the other side of the yard, Sneha is freaking out about the cute little squirrel shaking in the tree outside her window and making plans to eat her weight in ice cream during Sunday Sundae.
8:46 p.m. — Sneha arrives at Lamont, a blanket and sweatshirt smuggled inside her suspiciously full backpack. It takes her two minutes to get to the second floor, where J.J. and Reuben are still ensconced inside their stolen classroom. She and J.J. discuss their plans for the night and discover (horror of horrors) that they’re both probably going to be working until midnight.
9:01 p.m. — Reminded of “Night at the Museum,” J.J. thinks: “You’re in trouble, dum dum; you better run, run” (out of Lamont) and immediately escapes under the guise of “grabbing sustenance and other essentials for the night,” leaving Sneha all by her lonesome. Sneha feels lonely and texts her friends for company, but they apparently have the sleep schedules of functional people and don’t show up.
9:10 p.m. — J.J. arrives at Dunkin’ and buys a sugar-filled coffee for herself and a grilled cheese for Sneha (who just ate dinner but is not going to refuse more food).
9:11 p.m. — Sneha rather unproductively attempts to do homework. Her attempts to actually accomplish anything are somewhat inhibited by the fact that she’s obsessively taking notes on everything she does for the sake of posterity.
9:20 p.m. - Having finished the first item on her to-do list, Sneha decides that she deserves a break. As she catches up on all the messages she missed due to Harvard-Yale, she wonders why decided they should do this the day after The Game.
10:00 p.m. - J.J. returns with a food offering. The strangers eat in silence as they contemplate doing their homework.
10:22 p.m. - One of Sneha’s friends texts to say that The Crimson is boring. Sneha ends the friendship.
10:55 p.m. - J.J.’s friend leaves (wahhhh).
10:56 p.m. - Sneha finishes her first assignment (hooray!!!); J.J. is yet to have finished anything (boooo!!!).
11:10 p.m. - All of J.J.’s devices decide that they want to be difficult. Her phone and laptop throw tantrums and die so that she can’t do anything productive while she’s stuck in Lamont.
11:15 p.m. - Sneha and J.J. have their first conversation of the night… about TV.
11:29 p.m. - They discuss their (lack of) sleep schedules as J.J. begins painting her nails. (J.J. is serving).
11:56 p.m. - Minkai V. Li ’26 pokes his head through the door, hoping to steal a room for himself. Surprise: Sneha and J.J. already have it. J.J. and Minkai strike up a titillating conversation… about Cabot vs. Lamont (Lamont’s better, obvi). Minkai dares Sneha and J.J. to spend Thanksgiving break in Lamont because “24 hours is too easy.” (He’s not the one sleeping in Lamont, though, so maybe his judgment can’t be trusted.)
12:09 a.m. - After their surprise guest leaves, Sneha begins her fourth task of the night. She rests her head on the table, reminded of the somewhat comfy bed in her dorm, but then remembers to never give up.
12:21 a.m. - J.J. declares that she’s going to the bathroom. Sneha internally praises the wonderful choice of stealing a room on the second floor simply because the women’s bathroom is close.
12:35 a.m. - J.J. gets stuck in the bathroom stall for five minutes. Upon her return, Sneha shares her Cabot restroom horror story (iykyk). Sneha then remembers the Black Mirror episode, titled “The Stall,” in honor of the wackiness that is American bathroom stalls — why is the crack in the door that big?!
12:47 a.m. - Sneha and J.J. discuss their siblings and astrological signs; Sneha inadvertently breaks J.J.’s brain with birth statistics.
1:07 a.m. - Sneha and J.J. leave the comfort of their classroom to explore the treacherous domains of Lamont.
1:08 a.m. - Sneha and J.J. stand against a window, staring and scaring people as they walk out of the café.
1:15 a.m. - Having arrived at the third floor, Sneha and J.J. walk in on someone in the Media Lab Annex and, in their desperate retreat, stumble upon a book titled “Worst Ideas Ever.” (This little Lamont stay isn’t featured in the book, but it probably should be.)
1:18 a.m. - Sneha and J.J. discover the YA novel section. It’s very disorganized.
Sneha: “I read “The Selection” this week.”
J.J.: “You had time for that?”
Sneha: “No.”
1:20 a.m. - Sneha trips over a lamp, causing J.J. to hysterically laugh on the floor. This draws weird looks from other students.
1:21 a.m. - Satisfied with the Farnsworth Room (and its comfy chairs), Sneha and J.J. make the trek back to the second floor to retrieve their possessions and hunker down for the night. On the way, they encounter the warning they needed before they made the decision to stay in Lamont in the form of ominously placed yellow caution tape.
2:24 a.m. - Sneha realizes she’s been here for like 5.5 hours and it’s wearing on her. J.J. passes out.
2:30 a.m. - Ready to turn in for the night, Sneha journeys to the second floor to use the restroom. Lamont’s just a teeny bit dead, and the caution tape is freaking her out, so she listens to Taylor Swift’s album “Midnights” to quell her fears. On her way back from the restroom, Sneha spots another student hunched over the desk, a study carrel, their coat hanging on the wall, and is comforted by the fact that even at this late hour, she is not alone.
6:30 a.m. - Sneha and J.J. wake up! The sun begins to rise over a silent campus. The two (now) friends sit and wait, watching as the bricks turn gold in the morning light.
They survived.
8:01 a.m. - Sneha and J.J. are on their way out of Lamont when they (spur of the moment) accost a thesising senior, Chidera A. O. Ejikeme ’23, and attempt to learn from her wisdom.
JM: Have you done all-nighters before?
CAOE: Oh yeah, tons of times. I haven’t done a real one since, like, freshman year.
SMY: Do you remember what the freshman one was for?
CAOE: It was for an LS50 [Integrated Science] pset.
SMY: [gasps] I’m in LS50!
CAOE: Do not do that.
A little bit delirious, Sneha laughs maniacally.
CAOE: I’ll never forget being in Lamont basement, and I thought the windows were mirrors ’til the sun rose.
SMY: There’s windows down there?
CAOE: There’s windows in the basement. I thought they were mirrors, but they were windows. Because the sun rose through those windows. Never again.
JM: Do you have any advice for people who are going to be doing all-nighters? Specifically in Lamont.
CAOE: Order food.
JM: If you’re choosing a library, Cabot or Lamont?
CAOE: Lamont.
8:12 a.m. - Sneha and J.J. hug goodbye, never taking their cramped Canaday rooms for granted ever again.
To answer the question every Harvard student wants to know: Is Lamont better than Cabot? The answer: yes! If you’re looking for a place to study until the sun rises, Lamont is the place for you. The couches are comfy (so you don’t need a sleeping bag or pillows to stay cozy), the lighting creates an ambiance, and there will always be another mysterious room for you to explore.
