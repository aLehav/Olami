After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will establish the David Rubenstein Treehouse as the school’s first University-wide conference center and a welcome area for its future Enterprise Research Campus in Allston, the University announced Wednesday.
Supported by a gift from Harvard Corporation member and billionaire David M. Rubenstein, the new facility will host international summits, recruitment fairs, alumni events, and receptions, according to a University press release.
“I am honored to help Harvard with a conference center that will serve as a convening place for academic and business visitors, as well as Harvard faculty and students, at the exciting new Enterprise Research Campus Harvard is building in Allston,” Rubenstein said in the release.
Designed by Studio Gang, an architecture firm led by Graduate School of Design Professor Jeanne K. Gang, the center will contain a ground floor open to the public and multi-use spaces. Construction management companies Consigli and Smoot will undertake the building of the center.
The center will serve as a “front door” to Harvard’s planned Enterprise Research Campus in Allston, which will offer office, lab, residential, and hotel spaces. The Boston Planning and Development Agency approved the first phase of the project — a 900,000 square foot development — in July. The approval marked a victory for Harvard, as its plans for real estate development in Allston have long received backlash from residents and elected officials..
“David and I have had many wonderful conversations about Allston’s role in Harvard’s future,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the press release. “With this generous gift to support a world-class conference center, he is helping to bring together entrepreneurship, innovation, and research for the benefit of everyone.”
The center will operate completely on electricity from Harvard’s District Energy Facility, described by the University as “lower-carbon” and “climate resistant.” The building’s design also allows it to capture rainwater and use solar energy as a supplementary source of clean energy.
According to the release, the above-ground construction of the center will rely on mass timber rather than concrete or steel in order to reduce carbon emissions. The use of wood also illustrates the name of the building, and the upper-level areas “feel almost suspended within the surrounding tree canopy,” according to Gang.
“The building’s visible mass timber columns and beams emphasize the branching structure — you can see the V-shaped columns extending out and the diagonals of the cross-bracing reach all the way to the roof, becoming finer the higher they rise,” Gang said in the release.
Known for his philanthropy, Rubenstein has been a member of the Harvard Corporation since 2017 and is a co-founder and co-chairman of the private equity firm The Carlyle Group. Rubenstein currently serves as a member of the search committee for Harvard’s 30th president.
“Even with all that is possible virtually today, having a space to come together and collaborate unlocks the potential of the brightest minds,” Rubenstein said in the release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — A fundraiser for Harvard’s fencing program told a federal jury Wednesday that Maryland businessman Jie “Jack” Zhao — accused of bribing the team’s former head coach Peter Brand — provided key funding for the team.
Lawrence G. “Larry” Cetrulo ’71, co-chair of the Friends of Harvard Fencing fundraising group, told jurors on the seventh day of trial that Zhao and his wife were the largest parent contributors to the group, helping bolster a sport that Cetrulo said often struggled to secure financial support.
Brand, who was fired from his position as Harvard’s head fencing coach in 2019, is facing trial after allegedly accepting over $1.5 million in bribes from Zhao in exchange for recruiting spots for Zhao’s sons. Brand and Zhao were indicted on federal bribery charges in 2020.
Defense attorneys for Brand sought to show that Harvard’s fencing program needed financial support from parents, pushing the ex-coach to consider potential contributions that prospective fencers would bring to the program.
Cetrulo said Friends of Harvard Fencing provides more than 50 percent of the fencing team’s funding. He told jurors that without financial contributions from parents and alumni, the program “could easily be cut” during periods of economic downturn.
Zoran R. Tulum — a former fencing head coach at Stanford who testified later in the day — told a defense attorney for Zhao that programs at UC Berkeley, UC San Jose, Northwestern, Cornell, and Brown had been cut due to financial woes or to adhere to Title IX.
Tulum said, however, that he did not recall recruiting students based on families’ potential for financial contributions in his 13 years at Stanford.
Cetrulo, who represented Brand during the 2019 internal investigation that led to Brand’s firing, added he often shared his opinion with Brand on potential recruits and is “in constant contact with admissions and recruiting and development at Harvard.”
“I play a role in formulating the standards for recruiting,” Cetrulo said. “You need academic excellence, you need character, you need athletic ability, and it would be good to show some demonstration of capacity to support the program.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in a statement to The Crimson provided during Cetrulo’s testimony that he has no involvement with the University’s admissions processes.
“Larry Cetrulo is not employed by Harvard University in any capacity,” Dane wrote. “He does not receive training or documents related to Admissions related procedures and policies, nor has he met with admissions officers in his capacity as co-chair of the Friends of Harvard Fencing.”
Later in the day, Zhao’s lawyers sought to portray him as a friendly businessman with a habit of over-trusting others. Tony Wei, who co-founded iTalk Global Communications, Inc. with Zhao, testified that Zhao was sometimes “too soft” of a businessman.
Throughout the trial, prosecutors have sought to substantiate the alleged bribery scheme between Zhao and Brand by presenting a series of checks from Zhao on behalf of Brand, as well as invoices from iTalk to S+H Construction, the company that handled renovations for Brand’s Cambridge condominium in 2016.
Brand’s attorneys described the transactions between Brand and Zhao as “a friend loaning a friend money” in their opening statement Dec. 6.
Wei told jurors that Zhao had loaned $500,000 to Wei’s steel company in a lump-sum payment six months after meeting Wei. According to Wei, Zhao did not ask for a contract, interest, or deadline at the time of the loan.
When Zhao’s defense attorney, Michael T. C. Packard ’02, asked if Zhao chased Wei down for the money, Wei replied, “Actually, I chased him.”
The trial is set to resume at 9 a.m. Thursday.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities

Claudine Gay will become Harvard University’s 30th president, the school announced Thursday, ending a swift five-month search process that will elevate a person of color to lead America’s oldest academic institution for the first time in its history.
Gay, the current dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, will succeed Lawrence S. Bacow, who announced plans to step down in June. She will begin her term in Massachusetts Hall on July 1, 2023.
“When I imagine Harvard in the years ahead, I see a university that is even more connected to the world through our scholarship,” Gay said at an event announcing her selection Thursday. “The idea of the ivory tower — that is the past, not the future, of academia. We don’t exist outside of society, but as part of it.”
Gay, 52, will take over atop the University just as the Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision on a high-stakes affirmative action lawsuit against Harvard that could reshape admissions processes across American higher education.
She will also be tasked with steering the University’s finances through global economic uncertainty caused by a post-pandemic inflation spike, which precipitated a $2.3 billion drop in Harvard’s endowment value this year. Her tenure is likely to include a capital campaign as the University approaches its 400th anniversary.
At a press conference after her announcement on Thursday, Gay declined to elaborate about how Harvard might navigate a post-affirmative action reality, saying only that the University “will continue to champion the value of diversity.”
Gay will oversee Harvard’s continued expansion into Allston, as the school has moved ahead with ambitious development plans despite intense headwinds from local residents.
“With the strength of this extraordinary institution behind us, we enter a moment of possibility,” she said Thursday. “One that calls for deeper collaboration across the University, across all of our remarkable schools.”
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81, who chaired the presidential search committee, announced Gay’s election in an email to Harvard affiliates Thursday afternoon, hours after the Harvard Board of Overseers voted to confirm the pick.
“We are confident Claudine will be a thoughtful, principled, and inspiring president for all of Harvard, dedicated to helping each of our individual schools thrive, as well as fostering creative connections among them,” Pritzker wrote.
The 15-member committee landed on Gay after just five months, making it the shortest Harvard presidential hunt in almost 70 years. The group met formally about 20 times, Pritzker said in public remarks Thursday, whittling down an initial list of more than 600 nominations.
The daughter of Haitian immigrants, Gay grew up in New York and attended high school at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. She attended college at Stanford University before receiving a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1998.
Gay joined Harvard’s faculty from Stanford in 2006 as an expert on democracy and political representation in the Government Department. She became dean of the FAS’s Social Sciences Division in 2015 before ascending to her current post in 2018.
“She’s one of the Academy’s most creative and rigorous thinkers about vital aspects of democracy and political participation,” Pritzker said. “She is a political scientist, who is deeply engaged with practical issues and concerns — someone who is strongly focused on how the ideas and inventions born in our universities can make a positive difference in the world.”
As dean, Gay has steered the FAS through the Covid-19 pandemic and a stream of controversies related to sexual harassment and faculty diversity.
As academia writ large has grappled with a reckoning on sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination in the wake of the #MeToo movement, Gay levied sanctions against several well-known professors. In the early summer of 2019, she stripped the emeritus status of Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez, who faced allegations of nearly four decades of sexual misconduct, and suspended a high-profile Economics professor, Ronald G. Fryer Jr., who was accused of sexually harassing co-workers.
Harvard became engulfed in controversy in early 2022 after Gay sanctioned Anthropology and African and African American Studies professor John L. Comaroff following University investigations that found he violated the school’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies. Dozens of high-profile professors rallied to support Comaroff, questioning Gay’s sanctions in an open letter before reversing course just days later after a federal lawsuit against Harvard outlined years of misconduct allegations against anthropology scholar.
Gay also launched a review of Harvard’s tenure process after ethnic studies scholar Lorgia García Peña was denied tenure in November 2019, prompting backlash from students and faculty. The FAS review, released in October 2021, largely upheld Harvard’s tenure process but recommended some adjustments to add more transparency around associate professor reviews and the use of ad hoc committees.
Gay has supported the creation of an ethnic studies department at Harvard, a longtime demand of student and alumni activists. She initiated a cluster hire of ethnic studies scholars that brought in three scholars in the field this year. She has also worked to diversify the faculty, including by appointing an inaugural associate dean of diversity, inclusion, and belonging in the FAS.
As Gay walked into the Harvard Commons in the Smith Campus Center on Thursday for the University’s public broadcast, the room erupted into applause. When the president-elect took to the podium, she joked that she was surprised to see so many people at the reception — “I thought I was the only person still on campus” — before turning to her vision for the school.
“Harvard is where I found my intellectual home,” Gay said Thursday. “It has nurtured and inspired me since I first set foot in the Yard. I’m deeply invested not only in what Harvard is today, but also in what Harvard’s leadership means for the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Francis J. Doyle III, dean of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, will step down from his post at the end of the academic year to serve as Provost of Brown University, the school announced in a press release Thursday morning.
Doyle, who has served as SEAS dean since 2015, will begin his tenure as Brown’s chief academic officer in July 2023, leading the school’s efforts to expand its research presence and promote diversity and inclusion.
“They’ve done a lot of thoughtful work about growing their program, in particular growing research, expanding the campus,” Doyle said in a Thursday interview with The Crimson. “I want to jump in and participate in that.”
Brown President Christina H. Paxson said Doyle is the “right leader at the right time for the University” in Thursday’s press release.
“Frank has an exceptional record of leading a complex academic enterprise through extensive development of new programs, capital planning, faculty recruitment, and cultivation of philanthropic investment, all while building and strengthening community,” she said in the release.
Doyle’s predecessor, Richard M. Locke, will complete his tenure as Provost this month and assume a position as dean and vice president of Apple University.
Doyle said he finds his current post “incredibly rewarding” but hopes to “try to take my skills to a university scale.”
The departure continues a major reshuffling of Harvard’s top administrators. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay will succeed University President Lawrence S. Bacow to become Harvard’s 30th president in July, the school announced Thursday. Two other academic deans are set to depart at the end of the academic year, as well as the school’s Chief Financial Officer. Harvard Alumni Association Executive Director Philip W. Lovejoy is also retiring at the end of the calendar year.
As SEAS Dean, Doyle oversaw an expansion of the school’s master’s and Ph.D. programs. The number of undergraduates pursuing degrees in engineering and applied sciences disciplines also rose from 18 to 23 percent under his tenure, according to Harvard’s press release announcing his departure.
“SEAS has flourished and grown in innovative ways under Frank Doyle’s leadership,” Bacow said in the release. “Since 2015, the School has advanced Harvard’s teaching and research mission, attracted more students into engineering and the applied sciences, and forged new and creative partnerships across the University.
Gay praised Doyle for expanding research collaborations between SEAS and other schools.
“Frank is an eager connector and collaborator, who has enthusiastically formed partnerships both within and beyond Harvard to advance the mission and open up new and promising opportunities for research and teaching at SEAS,” she said in the release. “I’m deeply grateful for his leadership, service, and most importantly to have been one of those partners.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College admitted 7.56 percent of early applicants to the Class of 2027, marking the second-lowest early acceptance rate in the College’s history.
The College notified 722 of 9,553 early applicants of their acceptance to the Class of 2027 on Thursday at 7 p.m. The early acceptance rate marks a 0.3 percentage point decline from the Class of 2026 and nearly a 0.2 percentage point rise from the Class of 2025, who faced the College’s most competitive early admissions cycle in history.
Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 described the applicants admitted early to Harvard’s Class of 2027 as “amazing” in a Thursday interview.
“Not just in terms of their accomplishments but in terms of their life stories and the kind of educators they’ll be of each other once they’re here,” he said.
This is Harvard College’s second biggest early applicant pool, up from 9,406 for the Class of 2026 but still shy of the 10,086 students who applied for early admission to Harvard’s Class of 2025.
Of the applications received, roughly 78 percent of applicants were deferred and 9.5 percent were denied. Approximately 5 percent of applications were either withdrawn or incomplete.
“I think people realize, if you apply early anywhere, it usually is competitive, and that there’ll be some wonderful people who do not make it early who will, in fact, make it later on,” Fitzsimmons said. “So it’s a good situation.”
Students identifying as Asian American comprise 29.1 percent of admitted early applicants, a roughly 3 percentage point increase from the year before and the highest percentage of Asian American early admits in the College’s history.
The number of students admitted early who identify as African American reached 14.4 percent, a slight increase from last year’s 13.9 percent. Latinx students comprised 8.4 percent of the admitted pool, down from last year’s 10.5 percent. Native American and Hawaiian students made up 1.7 percent, down from 3.7 percent in the Class of 2026 but higher than the 1.3 percent for the Class of 2025.
“The whole idea has been, over a long period of time, to get out there and encourage talented people from all backgrounds to consider higher education,” Fitzsimmons said. “Harvard — and other institutions, and society in general — has succeeded in lots of respects.”
In October, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, which alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants in its race-conscious admissions processes.
Harvard has defended its admissions practices, advocating for the value of diversity in the classroom and on campus. The percentage of Asian Americans in the College’s admitted classes has grown by more than 27 percent since 2010, per Harvard’s website.
International students represent 14.1 percent of the admitted class, up from 12.6 percent for the Class of 2026. Over 14 percent of those admitted under the early action plan are first-generation college students, an increase from approximately 12 percent last year. In addition, 10.8 percent of admitted students qualify for federal Pell Grants.
The Class of 2027 will be the third class admitted under the test-optional policy enacted by the College in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Starting with the Class of 2026, families that earn incomes under $75,000 per year will have no cost of attendance, following an increase in the threshold from $65,000 in previous years. Fitzsimmons called the expansion of Harvard’s financial aid program a tool for “attracting talent.”
“I think that is enormously encouraging,” Fitzsimmons said.
Students applying for the regular decision cycle or who were deferred from the early action round will receive their decision at 7 p.m. on March 30, 2023. All admitted students are invited to the College’s admitted students weekend, known as Visitas, which returned to an in-person format for the Class of 2026.
