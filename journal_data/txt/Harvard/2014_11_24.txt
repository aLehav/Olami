After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
Bravo to the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition for the lawsuit it filed to force Harvard Corporation’s divestment from its vast holdings in toxic fossil fuels (“Student Activists File Suit Urging Harvard to Divest,” Nov. 19, 2014)!
In the same fashion that student divestment efforts in the 1980s blossomed into a worldwide, successful campaign against South African apartheid investments, may this action inspire major change at Harvard and other institutions to stem climate chaos.
These students should be thanked and emulated.

To the editor:
On November 8, The Harvard Arab Weekend included a panel discussing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement—a nonviolent, decentralized effort to put pressure on Israel to comply with international law (specifically, UN resolutions 194 and 242). This panel, which I moderated, was in tune with the conference’s progressive theme of “inspiring solutions.” Other panels discussed LGBT rights in the Arab world, media transparency, and the reemergence of medical research in the Middle East.
In the days before the panel, we were surprised when we received several emails asking us to cancel the panel, describing it as “anti-Semitic” and as advocating “the destruction of the one Jewish state.” The logic of these accusations, which were also expressed in an op-ed (“Reckless Sponsorship of Anti-Israelism,” Nov. 18, 2014), was not well articulated and seemed to be the product of over-intellectualization. The emails and op-ed also demonstrated a clear misunderstanding of the positions of several of our panelists on key issues—especially those of Dr. Noam Chomsky, who has questioned BDS approach and demands. There was also a gross misrepresentation of the BDS movement on the issue of the two-state solution. We encourage readers to visit the BDS website and make their own judgments.
We do not endorse the views of the invited speakers, and nor do our sponsors. We also understand that some may find the BDS movement controversial. But that is no reason to prevent an open forum of discussion from occurring at an academic institution. Silencing the “other” leads to misunderstanding and thus does not promote peace.

To the editor:
“Inspiring solutions” to the multitude of challenges facing the Arab World in a calm and  constructive manner was the theme that we, the Harvard Arab Alumni Association, chose for  our annual  Harvard Arab Weekend—the largest Arab conference in North America. Participants brainstormed avenues for a brighter future for the region under Harvard’s aegis of free speech, a right denied to most Arabs.
We inspired hope that echoed through Marcel Khalife's healing tunes at Memorial Church, through Bassem Yousseff’s humor that withstands oppression, through the resilience of Syrians yearning for freedom, through the dynamism of Arab entrepreneurs, through the vision of Arab media leaders, through the credibility of prominent financiers, through educating refugees, and through the Arab World’s best and brightest at Harvard.
Using peaceful tactics to express personal rejection of basic human rights infringements has been the hallmark of the struggle against apartheid. It is in this spirit, the same as the one behind Mahatma Ghandi’s nonviolent resistance, that one of the fifteen panels at the conference discussed the boycotts, divestment, and sanctions movement. Nudging states to comply with Security Council and UN resolutions through peaceful means is a method worthy of debate at an intellectual beacon of free speech like Harvard; the alternative (“Reckless Sponsorship of Anti-Israelism,” Nov. 18, 2014) is sheer censorship.
Extremists have always attempted to silence respectful debate and overwhelm those who dare to hope. We all face ideologues who attempt to monopolize the agenda by fear mongering, be it through physical violence or through curtailing freedom of speech. These ideologies can only succeed if they scare the majority, who yearn for a peaceful and prosperous future.
We are committed to healing the polarization tearing our region apart. Harvard’s collective wisdom must be at the forefront of such an honorable endeavor. We thank our thousands of participants: students, alumni, faculty, and sponsors. To those who fear free debate here at Harvard and there in our part of the world, we express our resolve to continue to dream, hope, and inspire solutions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When John Winthrop enjoined his fellow Puritans to make the Massachusetts Bay Colony “a city upon a hill” in 1630, he did not have hosting the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad—otherwise known as the 2024 Summer Olympics—in mind. Now, however, 384 years after Winthrop’s speech on the Arbella and three years before the International Olympic Committee picks the 2024 host city, Boston is in serious contention for the honor. Mayor Martin J. “Marty” Walsh is even on board, saying the games “would be Boston leading the United States.” While the games’ supporters are undoubtedly right that Boston could host a successful Olympics, the demands of the IOC and the lack of transparency in the current local discussions would make hosting the 2024 games far too much of a burden for the city and the region.
Currently, the campaign in favor of having Boston host the 2024 Olympics is led by the Boston 2024 Committee, an organization headed mostly by business owners like its chair, John Fish. The group No Boston Olympics is spearheading the anti-Olympics effort. Notably, both sides largely accept that Boston could make a great Olympic city. As the Boston 2024 Committee is fond of noting, the city has a dedicated corps of civic leaders in politics, academia, and business who could ensure that public-private cooperation and “state-of-the-art” planning make the Boston Olympics successful.
Unfortunately, the evidence does not bear out the Boston 2024 Committee’s conjecture that hosting the summer Olympics would be a net benefit for the area. The main issue for Boston will be the lavish demands of the International Olympic Committee. According to Smith College Economics Professor Andrew Zimbalist, who has studied the issue extensively, the IOC “has had great leverage” over potential hosts, and “costs have steadily escalated.” Moreover, the IOC gets half of all revenue from the games. Given that the research of Professor Zimbalists and others shows no gains in tourism or any other sector from hosting the games, the financial case for Boston 2024 is weak indeed.
The integrity of the Olympics is starting to decline because of the IOC’s domineering attitude towards host cities. So many cities have dropped out of the race to host the 2022 that the only remaining options are Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan, both in nations with what might charitably be termed spotty human rights records. In addition to providing fodder for comedian John Oliver, this situation underscores the extent to which the demands on hosts and the paucity of benefits have made being an Olympic city more a burden than an honor.
A further lesson of the ongoing 2022 debacle—which saw Oslo, Norway; St. Mortitz, Switzerland; Stockholm, Sweden; Munich, Germany; Krakow, Poland; and Lviv, Ukraine, all withdraw—is that, when presented with the costs, the public is not enthused by hosting the games. This phenomenon may explain why the Boston 2024 Committee has done such a poor job of communicating its plans openly, drawing the concern of local commentators. Polling shows that, when presented with the cases for and against the games, Massachusetts residents are not in favor of putting the Commonwealth and the City of Boston at the mercy of the IOC’s demands to the detriment of other public projects.
Ultimately, sometimes being an example for the world means not participating in a system run amok. While hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics would undoubtedly be a source of pride for Boston, Massachusetts, and New England, the venture would bring with it unspecified and likely enormous costs, and would require far more public participation than supporters appear willing to allow. Boston should not host the 2024 games, and should instead focus its considerable energies on other world-class endeavors.

Here are some numbers that keep me up at night: According to The Crimson’s Class of 2018 Freshman Survey, more Harvard students come from households with incomes in the national top 2.5 percent than the entire bottom 70 percent.
Holy shit.
If you’re not already freaking out about that fact, you should probably start. Harvard makes elites, it changes lives, it provides unparalleled proximity to boat shoes. It’s also got a socioeconomic diversity problem. This problem isn’t Harvard-specific; inequity in educational access is a huge structural thing, and the initiatives Harvard’s already got in place to counter it are pretty sweet. But there are a hell of a lot of things we could be doing to make this place more accessible. Right now, I want to focus on one of them: Why don’t we eliminate legacy preference in admissions?
I don’t know about you, but talking about legacy preference makes me feel weird, like on an existential level. I think the legacy conversation often feels like a referendum on who “deserves” to be here. If your parent(s) went to Harvard, critiques of legacy preference can feel like an attack on you, rather than on a policy. That sucks. And if your parents didn’t go here, a reminder that you have no ancestral claim to this space can reinforce all those “WTF is Harvard” feelings. But it’s precisely this anxiety that makes legacy preference such an important thing to talk about—and do away with.
Let’s be explicit about the link between socioeconomic diversity and legacy preference in admissions. There are a lot of affluent people who didn’t go to Harvard, and a lot of Harvard grads who aren’t affluent. But by and large, Harvard grads are likely to be pretty wealthy: The median mid-career salary of a Harvard graduate is $119,000, at the top five percent of American individual incomes. And 37 percent of current undergrads whose parent(s) went here come from households with incomes over $500,000 a year, at the national top one percent for household income. By giving an “extra look” at applicants with Harvard-educated parents, the admissions office privileges a demographic whose access to things like cello lessons, SAT tutoring, and clown school already makes them great Harvard candidates. I think we all feel pretty weird about that.
So why do we have legacy preference in the first place? The argument goes something like this: Legacy preference is necessary to not only upholding the tradition of the institution, but also vital to maintaining the kinds of alumni donations that fund our daily swai. Wouldn’t abolishing legacy preference, then, decrease scholarship money, and shoot the whole economic-inclusivity thing in the foot? Turns out, not really: As far as we can tell, there isn’t really a correlation between legacy preference and alumni giving.  And MIT, which doesn’t practice legacy preference, has an equal—if not better—alumni giving rate to Harvard.
So the argument is wrong. But it’s also just plain annoying. It’s the ethical equivalent of saying: Hey, people on financial aid! You can only be here because the rich people decided to be generous, not because you’re rad and everyone should get a great education. And the rich people will stop caring about your scholarships if they’re not getting something cool in return. This devalues pretty much everyone. Alums who really believe in accessibility. Children of alums, who may wonder whether they got in because of their SAT scores and clowning abilities or because of their parents. And the majority of undergraduates who are on financial aid, including students whose parents went here, who are made to feel like we’re here on someone’s largesse, and not because inability to pay should never be a barrier to education.
Here’s the other thing: Eliminating legacy preference in admissions isn’t that contentious. Seventy five percent of Americans think it’s a good idea, which is probably more than the amount of Americans that can agree the moon landing happened. And it shouldn’t be that hard to do, if we can only make enough noise to get the institution to do it. There are already peer institutions, like MIT and Caltech, that do just fine without legacy preference. And there are people here starting to organize around the issue: I’m fired up enough about it to be part of the Harvard Legacy Project, a group of people who think this could happen, and soon. Even all four of the tickets in the recent UC elections supported eliminating legacy preference in admissions, making the issue less controversial than Ava and Dhruv’s puns.
I think at the end of the day, part of why it’s tricky to talk about legacy preference on this campus is because we’re idealistic. We want equity of access. We want equity of access real bad. We want equity of access like my high school self wanted that boy whose favorite book was Thus Spoke Zarathustra. And the fact that this thing exists that means certain people get a leg up because their parents were lucky—that makes everyone feel bad. So let’s change it. Eliminating legacy preference in admissions isn’t going to fix the whole equity of access thing immediately, but it’s a really fucking good start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Affordable Care Act has had a rough few weeks. First, the Supreme Court agreed to hear King v. Burwell, a case that could result in millions of Americans losing subsidies for health insurance on the federal exchanges created by the law.
Then, videos of Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economics professor and an advisor during the ACA’s drafting, became a major fixture because of Gruber’s repeated references to “the stupidity of the American voter.” Finally, on Friday, House Speaker John Boehner sued President Obama in federal court over ACA-related grievances.
More than these recent hiccups, the ACA continues to struggle to gain traction among voters, though they largely, with the sole exception of the individual mandate, support its provisions. The results of this month’s midterms suggest that Democrats still have not found a way to communicate these provisions’ benefits, though given their lack of effort that result was foreseeable.
This failure to construct a political advantage out of a healthcare scheme that should be more popular stands in stark contrast to the speed with which the public grew accustomed to the Medicare program when Lyndon Johnson signed it into law in 1965. Today, of course, Medicare is very popular, and left-of-center commentators have rightly seized on parallels between the right’s anti-Medicare rhetoric of the 60s and its criticisms of the ACA to underscore why attacks on today’s law are misplaced.
What this analysis fails to mention, however, is that Medicare was far more popular far sooner. Even before it became law, voting against Medicare was a political risk, as 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater learned. Columnist Samuel Lubell noted a month before the 1964 election that Goldwater’s vote against an earlier Medicare bill saw him lose the support of older Republican voters who understood that they would benefit from the program, and associated it with other popular entitlements like Social Security.
Needless to say, the ACA has never enjoyed such public favor. Part of the explanation undoubtedly has to do with the ACA’s complexity and Medicare’s relative simplicity, a point made by Joe Nocera in a New York Times column at the height of the health exchange website debacle. But as Nocera’s interview with a former Johnson administration official in charge of the Medicare rollout attests, part of the ACA’s problem has been poor management. Medicare was hardly easy to get off the ground, and faced some significant opposition, notably from the American Medical Association. But it worked, basically immediately.
While complexity and poor management provide part of the explanation for why the ACA has had such trouble, however, these factors ignore a key issue that has hampered its implementation. Unlike Medicare, which was and remains a federal program, the ACA relies on states to take on key responsibilities, like the expansion of Medicaid and the establishment of insurance exchanges.
From its inception, this federalism has been troublesome. When the Supreme Court upheld most of the law in 2012, it ruled, using somewhat tortured constitutional logic, that the federal government could not force states to accept the Medicaid expansion. Now, millions of would-be-beneficiaries have been cut out of one of the law’s core provisions.
The Supreme Court’s decision in King v. Burwell might similarly gut the ACA’s exchanges. At issue is whether the IRS can offer subsidies to those purchasing insurance on a state exchange run by the Federal government, as opposed to one run by the state itself. The only fair reading of the law would answer this question in the affirmative.
But the only reason this issue even exists is that Congress entrusted states to build exchanges in the first place. With such vehement opposition to the ACA among state-level Republicans, Congress should perhaps have adopted a more centralized approach to this portion of the law. In fact, during his 2008 campaign, President Obama called for a “National Health Insurance Exchange,” but the vicissitudes of the drafting process led to the current state-based system.
In short, the largest lesson the writers of the ACA might have learned from Medicare is that policy has serious implications for politics. In the 1960s, the Medicare program provided straightforward benefits, and a competent group of federal officials had the freedom to implement them well.
The ACA was destined to be more complicated, but by putting its implementation at the mercy of the states, President Obama and Congress made it much more difficult to get it right, and unwittingly opened the door to mistakes and legal challenges.
One can only hope that these unlearned historical lessons do not prove fatal for a much-needed reform.

After months of delays, Felipe’s Taqueria may open at its new location at 21 Brattle St. in time to welcome students back from Thanksgiving break.
The popular Mexican late-night eatery was originally slated to open this past April before delays in construction and licensing forced the restaurant to temporarily operate out of neighboring burger joint Flat Patties. However, the wait is coming to an end soon, according to owner Thomas J. Brush.
With City of Cambridge inspections scheduled for early this week, Brush is hopeful that Felipe’s will be open by the first week of December.
“It’s probably going to be [next] Monday, and again anything could happen preventing that,” Brush said. “It’s going to be beautiful, it’s coming along nicely.”
Although Brush said he originally hoped to begin serving out of the new storefront before the Harvard-Yale football game this past week, delayed inspections have continued to postpone the restaurant’s acquisition of an occupancy permit.
The new location, significantly larger than Felipe’s old home on Mt. Auburn St., will feature multiple floors and a rooftop deck.

UPDATED: November 24, 2014, at 3:00 p.m.
Two historians discussed the importance of crafting long-term historical narratives, the subject of their recent book “The History Manifesto,” at an event Friday afternoon.
In a cozy nook of the Harvard Book Store, where shelves had been shifted to make room for rows of chairs and standing room around the perimeter, an audience of about 40 people engaged in a discussion and subsequent book signing with co-authors Jo Guldi ’00 and David Armitage, history professors at Brown and Harvard respectively.
During the talk, the authors emphasized taking long-term perspectives in the study of history, rather than focusing on brief moments in time. The authors said that historians had increasingly specialized in narrow areas of expertise, but over the past decade, the discipline has recognized the limitations of over-specialization and is moving towards a broader approach to historical analysis.
“What we diagnose, this crisis of short-term thinking, in ‘The History Manifesto,’ is also something that we have seen our fellow historians turn to with all of their intelligence,” Guldi said. “Over the last ten years there has been a return of thinking on the long-term scale among all our fellow historians.”
While Armitage and Guldi said their book is an examination of how the past has been and should be studied, it also points to the crucial role of history in planning for the future.
“History is a future-oriented discipline,” Armitage said. “We reconstruct multiple histories in the present in large part to orient ourselves toward potential multiple futures.”
Addressing potential students of history, Armitage said the discipline imparts students with skills in writing and critical thinking, which prepares them for a wide spectrum of careers, from law to economics.
“I was talking to somebody very powerful on Wall St. last year and he said to me, ‘Don’t send me economics graduates to my firm; my firm can teach you all the basics of finance in six months; that’s what we do, but we want historians and people who write well, who can think about complex issues,’” Armitage said.
Guldi said she wanted the audience to understand the current importance of historical study, particularly with the growing need to interpret big data and resolve current global problems.
“History is more relevant and more critical right now than it has ever been in the past,” Guldi said, “because we need to understand the past of institutions in order to understand why there is paralysis and lockdown in terms of environmental change, inequality, and international governments.”
Patrick B. Johnston, a statistician and former fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center who attended the event, said he enjoyed the emphasis on long-term history as opposed to inquires with a narrow scope.
“The long view is about trends…and I think it’s also about historical theory,” he said. “The evidence of theories in history has to be over [a] longer period than five years, obviously. So I personally find it fascinating.”

UPDATED: November 24, 2014, at 3:50 p.m.
Ruth C. Fong ’15 and Ben D. Sprung-Keyser ’15 are winners of the 2015 Rhodes Scholarship, The Rhodes Trust announced Saturday. They were the only two Harvard students to take home the prestigious award, a significant drop from last year’s six Scholars.
This is the smallest number of Rhodes Scholars since 2006, when no Harvard undergraduates won. The schools that were most represented among this year’s recipients were Yale with four scholars, and Brown, Princeton, and MIT with three each.
Fong and Sprung-Keyser will study at Oxford for two years beginning next fall. Sprung-Keyser plan to pursue a M.Phil in Economics, and Fong plans to take part in two separate Masters programs, a M.Sc. in Mathematics and Foundations in Computer Science and a M.Sc. in Computer Science.
Both pointed to the large amount of support they have received from the academic community, family, and friends.
Fong, who was out of town for her final interview, recalled celebrating over the phone with her friends who were at the Harvard-Yale game on Saturday. “I texted my roommates and my blockmates, and then a bunch of them started calling and screaming at the phone for a good minute and I couldn't tell who was speaking,” she said.
David D. Cox '00, Fong’s research adviser and an assistant professor in Molecular and Cellular Biology and Computer Science, spoke to her academic achievements. “I’m not at all surprised that Ruth was selected for the Rhodes,” he said. “She is uncommonly bright and she’s uncommonly ambitious, and that’s a powerful combination.”
University professor Lawrence H. Summers, an adviser to Sprung-Keyser, had equally laudatory things to say about his advisee.
"Ben will be a great Rhodes scholar.  He has done great in both curriculars and extra curriculars. I'm lucky to have had the privilege of advising him," Summers wrote in an email. "Ben is one of best economic undergraduates I have ever seen."
Sprung-Keyser said he believes the relatively low number of Harvard winners this year is mainly due to chance, noting that Harvard students have historically been well-represented due to their high achievements and support from the school.
“Harvard has performed phenomenally well over the last couple of years,” he said. “Numbers fluctuate from any year to another year, but I don’t think this says anything about the University as a whole except [that] the remarkable track that we have overall is an indication of how remarkable these students are and of all the help we get along the way.”
Fong and Sprung-Keyser missed Harvard-Yale on Saturday to spend the entire day interviewing in their respective regions. Both said that they didn’t go into the interview expecting to win, despite being finalists.
“It sounds cliche, but the truth is I've had an incredible amount of luck and incredible amount of help along the way,” Sprung-Keyser said. “Amazing professors, mentors, coaches, an amazing debate partner, a really incredible group of supportive friends, and family, and all of that stuff really matters and in many ways this is a team effort.”

The owners of the New England Patriots and the New England Revolution urged Harvard students to develop ideas that will improve the sports industry at an Innovation Lab event Friday afternoon.
The event marked the kickoff of the Deans’ Innovation Sports Challenge, which will span the remainder of the academic year. Winners will be announced in May.
Director of Harvard Athletics and co-chair of the challenge, Robert Scalise, laid out the five topic areas the challenge was designed to address in the sports industry: athlete and athletic performance, career and health before and after sports, improving the fan experience, rethinking the sports industry, and sport and social impact.
According to Gordon S. Jones, managing director of the i-lab, finalists will each receive $5,000 in seed money. The grand prize of $50,000 will be divided among the one or two winners.
Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, and his son, Jonathan Kraft, who owns the New England Revolution, participated in a “fireside talk” to kick off the challenge Friday. The talk was moderated by Business School professor Anita Elberse.
Robert Kraft began by giving the audience words of encouragement.
“To all the young people here, who are living their dreams, don’t be afraid to fail, but really go after the things that you are passionate about and when it doesn't go your way keep coming back if you believe [in your idea],” Robert Kraft said.
Both Robert and Jonathan Kraft also outlined the issues the sports industry faces and how those problems have surfaced during their time managing the Patriots.
Dean of the Business School Nitin Nohria, who is a co-chair of the sports challenge, spoke about how powerful sports can be in an individual’s life.
“How do we bring more of these moments to peoples lives, these transcendent moments that become a part of people’s lives?” Nohria said. “In many ways this challenge is an invitation to the great imagination of those at Harvard to address what we can do with this great human interaction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council representatives took a turn from their prepared agenda Sunday, openly criticizing their student government in light of voter turnout numbers in last week’s presidential election.
UC members said that this lack of enthusiasm will be one of the problems that Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the Council’s next President and Vice President, will face. They will be sworn into their offices in two weeks.
“With this new term, we need to rethink how the UC itself works,” the Council’s parliamentarian William Oh ’18 said.
Prompted on why just under half of undergraduates voted in the elections, representatives began to question the efficacy of the Council as a whole, the responsibility of individual representatives, and how problems could even be solved.
“I think a lot of people didn’t turn out to vote because they thought it wouldn't really do anything,” Mather House representative Domenica A. Merino ’17 said.
According to many representatives, the Council’s structure reinforced this apathy. They said general meetings offered little chance for representatives to discuss how to reform the UC and increase its relevance.
Dunster representative Daniel V. Banks ’17 suggested that the Council focus less on adhering to a strict agenda and allocate time for broader and more open conversations.
Others said that members were not performing their duties, and noted that representatives need to first ensure they are meeting their responsibilities before making more sweeping reforms.
"Oftentimes, we don’t do what we're supposed to do even competently or adequately,” Oliver W. Kim ’16, the Council’s Student Life Committee chair, said. As an example, he pointed to representatives’ low attendance rate at a presidential sexual assault task force meeting.
Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, the Council’s current president, openly acknowledged imperfection within the body, and encouraged representatives to criticize particulars.
“I am very aware that the UC is an imperfect organization. It was imperfect when I got here. It’s imperfect now that we’re basically leaving,” Mayopoulos said.
Others appeared more skeptical about how the UC could address problems, and requested specific questions to answers or proposals for change.
“We say this every year…. We say we need to talk about the UC,” Tamara S. Fernando ’16, UC Student Initiative Committee Chair, said.
Cabot representative Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 advocated that the UC implement change in small increments, such as the reintroduction of the UC historian and more advocacy for issues affecting minorities.
“We’re never [going to] see the day where the UC is a fully relevant body at Harvard, but we can be one step along a path towards that dream,” he said of current representatives.

Harvard divestment advocates caught national attention when they took their fight to court last week, but legal experts say the case’s claims may ultimately be too tenuous to be heard.
The suit rests on two counts, arguing that Harvard’s investment practices constitute “abnormally dangerous activity” and that those practices do not fulfill the University’s “fiduciary and charitable duties.” According to legal experts, including New York University trusts and estates professor William P. LaPiana ’73, the suit will very likely be met with a motion to dismiss by the University, based on a potential lack of standing in the court.
“It will be a very significant case if it goes to trial,” he said, citing the implications for potential future plaintiffs who disagree with the investment approach of a given charitable institution.
The suit’s first count alleges that the University’s investments are abnormally dangerous and, according to Fordham tort law expert Benjamin C. Zipursky, draws loosely from the language of tort law. Attempting to expand an existing tort law precedent, the suit argues that Harvard is willingly engaged in a dangerous activity by investing in fossil fuel companies which contribute to climate change, and , as a result, is liable for the damages that activity causes.
The plaintiffs did not ask for compensation for damages in their suit, but requested an injunction forcing Harvard to divest its holdings from the fossil fuel industry. Harvard, which has repeatedly said it will not divest its holdings, has not yet given indication of how it will respond to the suit.
Zipursky, for his part, said that the precedent invoked by the Harvard students appears to be too narrow to support their case. In this case, he and others argued, the University is not directly causing the damages, creating an extended causality that likely places the case outside of tort law. And, even if that extended causality is accepted by a court, the damages and liability both remain difficult to quantify.
“If they're meaning to suggest that this is a tort suit...then it isn't plausible,” he said, adding that the group could be using the language to “dress up their argument.”
Albany Law School professor Timothy D. Lytton agreed.
“You don’t owe a duty to the companies that you invest in,” he said. “I can't imagine that any court would imagine that investment is a form of abnormally dangerous activity.”
Responding to legal experts arguments, Alice M. Cherry, a plaintiff and second-year student at the Law School, maintained on Sunday that the case was intended to expand upon tort precedent.
“We are arguing for an expansion of the law,” she said. “There is a long history in tort law of expansion of liability...to address new social problems.”
In its second count, the suit claims that the University’s investment in fossil fuels constitutes a mismanagement of charitable funds. Typically, the Massachusetts Attorney General initiates cases in which a charitable organization has mishandled funds, however the plaintiffs aim to exercise their right as individuals with a “special interest” in the decisions of the University.
According to the claim, the University’s continued investments in fossil fuels infringe upon the goals instituted in the University’s original charter, namely “the advancement and education of youth.”
Cherry, who called climate change a “different problem in degree and kind,” said that the investments “affect [Harvard students’] ability to enjoy the full benefits of a Harvard education.”
Even if the suit is not brought to court, it may still have an impact, according to Lytton.
The suit “frames the issue as one of investor responsibility instead of oil company liability,” he said, calling it “somewhat of a reach” to win a judgement but contended that it may still effect change.
Regardless of the outcome, he said, the process itself could benefit the divestment movement by bringing press coverage to the issue. Moreover, if the case proceeds far enough to enter discovery—a formal process of information gathering prior to trial—the University’s investment practices and objectives could better come to light.
Lytton cited the suits brought against the Catholic Church following allegations of child abuse. Few suits made it to court, yet many unearthed information through the period of discovery and the subsequent release of information.
Benjamin Franta, a plaintiff and Ph.D. candidate in applied physics, declined to offer a response to legal experts, but said he had high expectations for the case.
“Of course we don’t know what will happen, we are hopeful the case will be heard,” he said. “I think the time has come for institutions—especially charitable institutions—to start to think about what is appropriate for them to invest in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a full morning of races on the Charles on Saturday. Heavyweight and lightweight crews combined forces to take on the Foot of the Charles, where the varsity A boat took second place over all.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Crimson heavyweights contributed seven boats for the fours races on Saturday, with the A boat taking second place overall. Harvard finished with a time of 13:11.6, just over a second behind the top boat from Northeastern.
“Northeastern rowed some really great pieces this morning,” senior Max Meyer-Bosse said. “I’m pleased with this morning, but there’s definitely some work to be done.”
The B boat for Harvard took sixth place in the races with a time of 13:24.6, and the C boat came in 14th place at 13:54.0.
The heavyweight freshmen finished in the top spot in the first-year division with a time of 12:18.0, almost 19 seconds ahead of the next boat, the freshman A crew from Brown.
“It was a great morning for the freshmen,” Meyer-Bosse said. “They’ve been kinda up and down for a little bit, but they really put things together and had a really good piece.”
Being just the second regatta of the season, the Crimson had to prepare a lot to perform well on the water. Racing was done primarily in fours except for the freshmen, who were in eights.
“We broke out the fours in the last week,” Meyer-Bosse said. “Each boat was kinda focused on itself, everyone came out really strong this morning.”
Harvard heads into the off season with two fall regattas now in the books.  Northeastern headed home Saturday with the small margin of victory.
“It’s unfortunate being on the wrong side of the second difference.” Meyer-Bosse said. “You gotta give northeastern the credit it deserves for nipping us in two close races, sometimes it goes the other way, but they definitely deserved this one. Going forward, we’ll do our best through the winter season.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Crimson lightweights competed alongside the heavyweights in Saturday’s regatta. The boat were the only lightweight team on the water, and its results was mixed in with the heavier boats.
The A boat performed the best of the lightweight crews, finishing 10th overall with a time of 13:38.5.
“The top four did well,” said captain Alexander Bonorris, who rowed in this boat. “Beating a significant number of heavyweight JV crews that we raced against.”
The B boat improved its placement from last year finishing 14:06.9 in 17th place.
“I think that the standout performance of the weekend came from the C four, [which finished with a time of 14.11.1],” Bonorris said. “These guys placed in the top 25 in a tough field of heavyweight competition.  It was great to see them perform like this, and it speaks to the depth of our team this year.”
Headed into the winter months, the crew will remain practicing indoors until a 10-day training trip to Florida that the whole team takes.
“We are fitter and stronger than last year,” Bonorris said. “It is crucial that we keep this going coming into the spring.”
The lightweights mostly compete during the spring season and only had three regattas since the start of the school year.
“I think that our squad from the top to the bottom showed our ability to move four man boats well,” Bonorris said. “This is something that we demonstrated earlier in the season at the Princeton Chase, and I think that we again showed that we are proficient in boats smaller than the typical eight man shell.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hoping to finish the season on a high note, the Harvard men’s cross country team headed to New York to compete in the IC4A championships, while top runner Tom Purnell went to Terre Haute, Ind. to compete at the NCAA National Championships.
Both parties turned in solid performances, as Purnell clocked in with a time of 32 minutes, 6 seoncds to improve on his previous year’s performance, while the rest of the team took home a hard fought fourth-place finish to close out the season.
NCAA NATIONALS
Competing in a field containing the best runners in the nation, junior Purnell represented the Crimson at Terre Haute, looking to improve on his performance from the prior year.
Ultimately, Purnell was able to improve on his previous performance by 10 seconds, while placing 170th, 28 spots higher than last season’s showing. Oregon sophomore Edward Cheserek repeated as national champion with a time of 30:19.4.
The race ended up being a much slower and tactical race than in years past, as the conditions made the competitors adopt a less aggressive approach.
Little separated Purnell from the lead at the 3k mark, as the junior was four seconds off the leaders despite sitting in 146th place. However, the England native was unable to keep up with the group as it started to pull away.
“For a tall guy like Tom, there was nowhere to run and move up.” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We would’ve been really pleased walking away with him in the top 100 and he was just a little bit off that but the way [nationals] goes, if you’re a little bit off, the points add up quick.”
Despite being further back at the 8k mark, the Harvard runner was able to use a quick 6:27 2k finish to close out strong and gain 10 spots, ultimately finishing in 170th.
While Purnell was unable to challenge for All-American, Saretsky believes the runner gained invaluable experience for a possible return to nationals the next year.
“It was a solid run, an improvement on last year,” Saretsky said. “I think [he walked] away from the course feeling like there was some unfinished business. There’s some real hunger and motivation to be back next year.”
IC4A CHAMPIONSHIPS
The rest of the team traveled down to New York to close out its season at the IC4A Championships, competing against squads from the Northeast.
Captain Will Geiken led the team with a 3rd place finish, clocking in at 25:19.9, edging out George Mason’s Michael Conway by .3 seconds in a tight push down the chute in his last race for the Crimson.
“I got out into the flat and got into third.” Geiken said. “It came down to the line and I just had to really dig to make sure he didn’t pass me.”
The senior was followed by junior Chris Allen who finished in 15th with a time of 25:31.4, while freshman Ben Huffman continued a strong rookie campaign by crossing the line with a time of 25:38.0, good enough for 19th.
The scoring contingent was wrapped up by sophomore Brandon Price and senior Dan Milechman, who clocked in at 26:07.2 and 26:24.2, placing 35th and 46th, respectively. Harvard finished with 114 points, with Ancient Eight rival Columbia taking home the title with 65 points.
“It was probably their strongest team showing of the season,” Saretsky said. “Geiken went out on a real high note with a third place finish and for a lot of our guys, this is where the Ivy League Championships is going to be next year so it’s great for them to see the course and get a feel for it.”
With his career ultimately coming to an end, Geiken believes that the team has the potential to compete for success these upcoming years.
“They have a good group of talent,” Geiken said. “It’ll be about putting in hard work to make sure they’re competitive with the top of the Ivy League and trying to get a team back to Nationals again. They have the capability of doing that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks after reaching the championship game of the CWPA Northern Division tournament, the Harvard men’s water polo team (22-10, 7-4 CWPA) travelled to Annapolis, Md., to end the season at the CWPA Eastern Championship. Despite a No. 18 national ranking, the Crimson dropped matches to Navy and Johns Hopkins before salvaging seventh place with a victory over George Washington.
“Although it’s not where we wanted to end up, it always feels much better to end the season with a win,” junior 2-meter Ben Zepfel said. “We just…tried to have as much fun as we could playing together one last time.”
HARVARD 14, GEORGE WASHINGTON 13
With 5:13 remaining in the seventh-place game against the Colonials (13-15, 1-7), Harvard held a 13-8 advantage, it largest lead of the match. An offensive onslaught cut this margin to one, but the Crimson would hold firm in the waning minutes to preserve the win.
“We really wanted to win to end our season on a good note,” junior goalie Colin Woolway said. “At the same time, we were able to play pretty freely and loosely knowing that it wasn’t a semifinal [or a] championship game.”
Zepfel, who lead the team with 59 goals on the season, finished with five scores in the game. In the first quarter, he gave Harvard a 2-0 lead with a pair of goals separated by just more than a minute.
The Crimson held a lead until the final whistle, but until the fourth quarter, George Washington never fell behind by more than three goals.
The Colonials Bogdan Petkovic provided his team’s offense throughout the game, finishing the game with six goals on nine shots and an assist. In the last three minutes of the fourth quarter, with George Washington still mounting a frantic rally, he scored two goals.
JOHNS HOPKINS 10, HARVARD 5
The scoreboard seemed to come from a nightmare.
After the Blue Jays (14-12) scored with 2:06 left in the second quarter, Harvard stared at a 5-0 deficit, and would end the half with a score of 5-1. While the Crimson would fight back with four second half scores, Johns Hopkins never surrendered the lead en route to a 10-5 win.
“The game against Johns Hopkins was one of the unluckiest we’ve played in a while,” Zepfel said. “We managed to get a lot of great opportunities, but we were having a really tough time putting our shots away.”
Despite outshooting the Blue Jays 32 to 28, Harvard finished with its lowest goal total of the season. Sophomore 2-meter defender Dan Stevens and junior attacker Blake Lee both tallied two scores.
The Crimson offense seemed on the verge of a breakthrough early in the second half when the team scored in the first forty seconds of play. Fifteen seconds later, Johns Hopkins responded with a goal of its own.
NAVY 15, HARVARD 10
In a September match-up against Navy, Harvard recorded its most impressive victory of the season thus far. Two months later and against the Midshipmen again, the Crimson suffered perhaps its most deflating loss.
With a 15-10 defeat in the opening round of the CWPA Eastern Championships, Harvard removed itself from title contention.
“We came into the weekend just wanting to execute our game plan, meaning focusing on the defensive end and moving a lot on offense,” Woolway said. “I think Navy was able to capitalize on our mistakes.”
Navy surged to victory thanks to a second quarter run in which the Midshipmen scored four unanswered goals. After carrying an 8-5 lead into halftime, Navy widened the margin by outscoring the Crimson 5-3 in the last frame.
The final result overshadowed a big day from Zepfel, who topped all scorers with six goals.
His first goal gave Harvard an early 2-0 lead.
“It was the last tournament of the season for us, so there was no reason to hold [anything] back,” Zepfel said. “I left everything out there in the pool.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday, the Crimson dove in head first, running—or swimming—away with a handed victory over Columbia.
Harvard men’s swimming and diving (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) has already established itself as a powerhouse this season, following its first meet’s victories against Dartmouth (0-2, 0-2) and Cornell (3-2, 2-2) with a 207-88 win over the Lions this weekend.
As the defending Ivy League Champions, the Crimson dominated the meet, sweeping 10 of the meet’s 16 events. Harvard started this streak with the 200-yard medley relay—the first event—in which the B team beat the A team by a mere .32 seconds.
The Crimson continued to sweep, keeping Columbia out of the top three in the 1650-yard free, the 200-yard free, the 100-yard back, and the 100-yard breast. The Lions fought back, managing to get a few swimmers on the podium, only to be shut out again in five more events—the 100-yard free, the 200-yard back, the 200-yard breast, the 500-yard free, and the 100-yard fly.
“Columbia was pretty broken down but we were broken down as well,” co-captain Mike Gaudiani said. “We tried to put a statement out by winning the first two relays. That really set a good tone for the meet. Then we just kept hammering away.”
Co-captain Griffin Schumacher anchored the winning 200-yard medley relay, and he topped the podium for the 50-yard and 100-yard free. In his years at Harvard, Schumacher has broken four Crimson relay team records, holds two individual top-five records, and has competed at the NCAA championships every year since his freshman season.
Gaudiani, a 2012 Olympic trial participant, made his presence known as well, placing first in the 1650-yard and 500-yard free.
“[The depth of the team] just speaks to the training and the hard work that we’ve put in,” Schumacher said. “We’ve been working incredibly hard since even before September. Some of that work is beginning to show up right now.”
Another notable performance came from sophomore Eric Ronda, who placed first in the 100-yard breast and swam breaststroke on the winning 200-yard medley relay team. Ronda, whose 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke times put him second all-time in Harvard’s record books, did not disappoint, placing first in the Crimson’s sweep of the 200-yard breast.
However, the upperclassmen are not the only ones making waves this season. Freshman Jack Boyd placed second in both the 200-yard free and the 500-yard free. Teammate Shane McNamara took second in the 100-yard and 200-yard breast and swam on the second-place winning 200-yard medley relay team.
“This year the freshmen are going to have a huge role both on our team and on the other Ivy teams,” Ronda said. “We’ve come closer together as a team this year and we’re putting in some really good work right now.”
Rookies also dominated diving, with Columbia senior Micah Rembrandt’s three-meter third place finish marking the only podium finish from an upperclassman. Harvard freshman Bobby Ross finished second, ahead of Rembrandt.
In the one-meter competition, freshman David Pfeifer took first, with a score of 311.18. This time, Ross had to settle for third, Columbia’s Jayden Pantel edging him out by less than a point.
“[The freshmen] have just bought into the program 100 percent,” Schumacher said. “They were all really strong performers in high school. We’re just trying to take that strong base they have and build off it.”
Perhaps another reason for the success of the underclassmen comes from the leadership and example provided by the team’s veterans. In the past three seasons alone, the Crimson has set 11 school records, culminating in the Ivy title last year.
Looking forward, Harvard aims to repeat last year’s feat, as well as expand the team it takes to the NCAA meet in March.
“There’s always that expectation of the same performance,” Gaudiani said. “You can’t be complacent and that’s something that our team has done a really good job of. [We bring] that energy to every meet and every practice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They did it once. They did it twice. But ultimately, three times was just too much.
After taking down Yale both on the road and at home this season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team came up empty in the Ivy League championship tiebreaker, falling to Yale in straight sets at the Malkin Athletic Center, 3-0.
“I think all of us left a little frustrated just because the games were all so close and we had beat them two times previously this season,” said junior middle blocker Caroline Holte. “So we knew we were capable of beating them.”
Despite the fact that the game was decided in straight sets, Harvard (19-5, 12-3 Ivy) proved to be a nuisance for the Bulldogs (17-7, 13-2 Ivy) the entire night. With Harvard needing to win the last three sets to win the game and clinch a berth in the NCAA tournament, the squad battled Yale toe-to-toe through the first half of the set. Standing at a 17-17 tie, the teams had been even at 12 points in the set thus far. No team had held larger than a three-point lead.
But the Bulldogs would rally off four straight points to gain a commanding lead. The Crimson responded with two of its own, but Yale quickly answered with three kills to force a game point. Two kills from junior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace fended off two game points, but a kill from Bulldog Kelly Johnson ended Harvard’s hope of playing for an NCAA championship.
The other sets were also highlighted by close play and late Yale surges.  After falling behind, 4-0, in the first set of the game, the Crimson got back into the game by taking five of the next seven points to secure a 10-5 lead. The Crimson would rally to tie the set at 18 points apiece, but Harvard never was able to take the lead. Yale proceeded to outscore the Crimson 7-3 in the last 10 points to take a 1-0 lead into the second set.
The Bulldogs got off to another 10-5 start in the second set, but the Crimson won 13 of the next 18 points to take an 18-15 lead. But behind two kills from Kelly Johnson of Yale, the Bulldogs strung together five straight points to regain momentum. The teams traded the next eight points to give Yale the chance to win a set point. With no room for error for Harvard, Yale senior Mollie Rogers recorded a kill to give the Bulldogs the second set.
Rogers led the game with 19 kills on the night. Kelly Johnson and Maya Midzik of Yale recorded 13 and 12, respectively. The highest Crimson output was sophomore setter Corinne Bain with 10. Wallace and sophomore Grace Weghorst followed her with eight of their own.
The team’s .173 kill percentage was the second lowest in the season only to .172 total that the team put up in the first conference game against Dartmouth.
Right from the start, this game had the atmosphere of a championship game. Students, parents, and alumni from both schools filed in in groves to root their respective teams to victory before the 131st rendition of The Game.
“Naturally, [the crowd] was bound to be a distraction,” Holte said. “There were just a lot of things happening that don’t happen in one of our typical matches. It took a little while for us to get back in the game internally."
The loss snaps the eleven-game winning streak that Harvard brought into the contest. During the streak, the team averaged less than one set per loss.
But even with the defeat, the Crimson still takes home a share of the Ivy League title, a claim that Harvard has not been able to make since 2004.
“It’s the best accomplishment our team could have achieved,” Holte said. “Our goal from day one was to win the Ivy League and that was what we accomplished. It just could not feel better to have everything pay off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After coming off a full week of practice, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) showed up to Blodgett Pool ready for revenge on Friday.
After losing to Columbia (0-3, 0-3) last season, the Crimson won 15 of 16 events in the dual meet against the Lions. It took the top three places in five events.
“I'm guessing Columbia [tapered like last year] because they wore fast suits for this meet,” junior Danielle Lee said. “We were definitely nervous going into the meet.”
After beating Cornell and Dartmouth in its season opener, the Crimson had another strong showing, and beat Columbia by over 100 points, 215-85.
Cheers of encouragements were heard around the pool throughout the meet, as teammates pushed each other on and counted laps in each event.
“We wanted to take each event one at a time,” co-captain Cassie Corneau said. “Going in, we knew there was a possibility that the meet would be a challenge so we wanted to do all of the little things in each event to score as many points as possible.”
Six swimmers and divers came away with multiple event wins. Sophomore Victoria Chan led the pack with four first place finishes: the 200-meter medley relay, and the 200, 100 and 50 freestyle races.
In a fast-paced race for the first event, Chan helped Lee, co-captain Stephanie Ferrell, and junior Kendall Crawford beat the Lions’ relay team with a time of 1 minute, 43.48 seconds, edging their opponents out by just .20 seconds.
Junior Sherry Liu had three wins, and Lee, Crawford and freshman Hannah Allchurch added two wins each. It was Lee’s first sweep of this season, as she finished first in the 100 and 200 backstroke races.
“I had been working on my underwater kicks off the wall for my backstroke events and improving my breaststroke technique for the 200 IM,” Lee said. “My coaches have told me that there are several little adjustments that need to be made like keeping my tempo up that I will continue working on during practice.”
Sophomores Daniela Johnson and Ashlee Korsberg, and freshman Regan Kology placed second and third, respectively, to add points to Harvard’s scoreboard.
Korsberg and Kology, along with Liu, dominated the 500 free, taking the top three spots with a margin of three seconds separating them from the nearest Columbia competitor.
With a time of 10:04.74, Liu also nabbed the top spot in the 1000 free, outswimming the second-placed Kology by eight seconds.
In the only race that it lost, the 200 breast, the Crimson finished only .51 seconds behind the Lions.
The Crimson diving team swept the competition, with Allchurch bringing in first place, senior Schuyler Moore placing second, and freshman Alisha Mah taking third in both the 3-meter and 1-meter dives.
In the 3-meter dive, Allchurch won by over 20 points with 299.33 points. Though it was by a smaller margin, she solidly took first place with a score of 279.90 in the 1-meter.
About halfway through the meet, attention was diverted outside the pool. After 24 years of coaching, Keith Miller’s tenure was recognized, and his position was endowed as the Class of 1989 Head Coach for Diving.
“I am thrilled that the diving coach is now being endowed,” Lee said. “Diving is an integral part of the team and the divers have always done a spectacular job at our meets.”
Next week the teams will head to different places for their first away meets, beginning December 4th. The swim team will be competing in the Texas Invitational in Austin, Texas, while the diving team will be travelling to Athens, Georgia, for the UGA Invite.
“This meet really showed how strong we are as a team and how well we can compete,” Corneau said. “Everyone stepped up and did their part. We know we can push through to the finish and that is what we will take with us into future meets.”

Good morning, Harvard! It’s crazy to think that The Game is over. It’s certainly been a very action-packed weekend, full of bitterly disappointed Yalies, recent and not-so-recent college graduates, witty posters for College GameDay, celebratory festivities (both before and after The Game), Sam Clark references, and frantic last-minute shopping at the Coop for Harvard apparel. But now all the Yalies—and other party-crashers—have rolled their suitcases out of the gates of Harvard Yard. The campus is quiet and empty. Only remnants of the wild weekend remain: traces of navy blue, shards of red solo cups, and of course, the tears of Yalies. How can we possibly return to the commonplace routine of school? Also, did anyone study this weekend? But in a mere two days, we will finally have our first break and a ready-made excuse to load up on turkey and cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes—basically anything but d-hall food!
