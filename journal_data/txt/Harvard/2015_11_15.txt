After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an offseason full of questions, the Harvard men’s basketball team (1-0) finally began to get some answers when it took down crosstown rival MIT in the season opener at Lavietes Pavilion, 59-39.
Senior Agunwa Okolie spoke afterwards of a sense of urgency for this team. In their last year, classmates Okolie, captain Evan Cummins, and forward Patrick Steeves want to make the most of the time they have left in a Crimson uniform. After the departure of their classmate Siyani Chambers, who withdrew for the 2015-2016 season after an offseason ACL injury, how the team would fare in their final year was very much up in the air.
MIT is far from the toughest test Harvard will face this season, but the game had value in providing game experience for a Crimson team with six rookies. Coach Tommy Amaker used a deep bench, with 13 players getting playing time in the game.
DOUBLING DOWN ON DEFENSE
Though the team may have been without its top three scorers from last season, Amaker’s trademark remains: strong defense. Even when the team struggled to get the ball in the hoop in the first half, shooting just over 30 percent from the floor, the Crimson held the Engineers to just 19 points in the first frame.
“Defense was the story for us,” Amaker said. “I thought it was a good team effort to hold this team to 39 points.”
Cummins played a major role in providing a spark for the defense, by being vocal on the floor and leading by example for his younger teammates. The captain had a career-high 10 rebounds on the night, nine of which came in the first half.
While Harvard struggled with help defense during its exhibition against McGill, it was a strength against MIT as the backcourt held its own and forced the Engineer guards to take shots under pressure as the shot clock wound down.
“We had a great help side. [MIT] did a great job of moving the ball and quickly changing sides, so for us it was just staying disciplined,” Okolie said. “Say if one man gets beat on the dribble, another guy will come and help.”
A NIGHT OF FIRSTS
From tip off, one could see that this is a new Harvard team. For the first time since 2008, coach Tommy Amaker had two freshmen in his starting lineup–guards Tommy McCarthy and Corey Johnson.
McCarthy has long been lauded as the likely replacement for Chambers. He not only played the role of floor general for the young Harvard team, but also led his squad with 12 points and three assists on the night.
“I think he’s learning,” Amaker said of McCarthy. “Certainly gaining some experience and confidence is critical and I think he was able to play in a way that was pretty solid.”
Johnson showed his strength from the perimeter, sinking three of five shots from behind the arc. Along with junior Corbin Miller, Johnson’s strength from deep helps the Crimson spread the offense and draw defenders away from the paint, leaving the big men open to score.
Though the young pair showed offensive spark, it was clear it was their first collegiate game. Both struggled to get things going in the first half, shooting a combined 3-for-12 through the first 20 minutes.
But in the second half with 16:37 to play, the duo jumpstarted the team’s 15-0 run that began with a Johnson three. McCarthy would then sink three free throws from the charity stripe and strip the Engineers on their next possession, extending the lead to 13 with an uncontested layup.
With the starting rotation giving the Crimson some wiggle room, Amaker gave fellow freshmen Weisner Perez and Balsa Dragovic a chance to log their first minutes of the season.
“They’ve been playing really well for us and are going to need to continue doing it for us,” Cummins said. “Everything is new for them, they are learning as they go.”
The rookies were not the only ones tallying their first minutes in a Harvard uniform. Steeves, who has been plagued by injuries during his Crimson career, tallied one point and one rebound in two minutes on the floor.
“I’m very happy for Patrick because he’s been banged up and injured,” Amaker said. “To come back and spend that kind of time, to get healthy with the kind of injuries he’s had. I was very happy for him, and our team was very happy for him, and that’s a really cool thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first road contest of the year, the Harvard men’s basketball team (1-1) succumbed to the relentless pressure of the Providence Friars (1-0), committing 22 turnovers in a 76-64 loss.
The Crimson held its opponent to under 40 percent shooting from the field and blocked seven shots, but its offense was often its worst defense—Providence turned 14 steals into 18 points, four coming in the deciding 15-2 second half run.
“I thought we really competed and gave great effort,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we really fought. Silly turnovers and some things like that hurt us, but I trust our guys to grow through the fire.”
A day before, Amaker’s presser centered on the first four minutes of the second half—a part of the game he constantly harps on. In its opener against MIT, the Crimson men’s basketball team took its lead from two to 17 with a quick spurt to begin the second period. A day later, Harvard scored 12 of the first 18 points in the second half to pull even at 41. The Dunkin Donuts Center, rowdy throughout the first half, became silent.
Then the Kris Dunn show started in earnest.
The senior, whom NBC Sports ranked as the best player in college basketball before the season, had seven steals in the first half but shot just 2-of-10 from the field. Playing in front of nearly 10,000 fans—many wearing the “Get It Dunn” shirts distributed before the game—Dunn steadied himself and the team quickly. Rodney Bullock broke the 41-all tie with a layup, but Dunn did the rest.
In the ensuing five and a half minutes, he outscored the Crimson 14-5. He punctuated a personal 9-0 run with a dunk that pushed the lead to 13 and had both Dunn and his coach Ed Cooley gesturing for the crowd to get on its feet.
A floater by senior Agunwa Okolie temporarily stopped the bleeding, but Dunn tore the wound wide open. He followed Harvard’s first basket in four and a half minutes with a layup in traffic; two possessions later, he held the ball at the top of the key for 25 seconds before draining his only three-pointer of the night to push the lead to 13.
Harvard threatened just once more, cutting the lead to nine with 5:30 to go. Yet Dunn would not be denied, scoring four straight points for his side. On the night, he finished with 32 points, six rebounds, five assists, two blocks, and eight steals while holding freshman Tommy McCarthy to nine points—none in the second half—on 2-of-13 shooting.
“Kris Dunn was sensational and had as complete a game as you can ask for in a backcourt player,” Amaker said.
Junior forward Zena Edosomwan, who had 13 points and a career-high 16 rebounds, simply shook his head when asked to describe Dunn’s performance.
“He’s just a great player—one of the best players in college basketball,” Edosomwan said.
For the first 25 minutes of the game, the story was the freshman Crimson backcourt. Rookie Corey Johnson led Harvard with 17 points, making five of his 10 treys. McCarthy and Johnson had 21 of the Crimson’s 29 first-half points between them, keeping the game within arm’s reach with a barrage of threes.
Johnson and McCarthy were forced to carry the scoring load because of foul trouble that kept Edosomwan and Okolie on the bench for much of the first half. The two combined for 20 second-half points but had just three before the break.
Afterwards, both players and coach bemoaned the team’s inability to stop Providence runs. Twice, the Friars scored nine unanswered points as the Crimson struggled to go “stop basket stop”—the team’s motto for breaking runs. After getting back-to-back Edosomwan dunks to tie the game at 41, Harvard never scored more than one unanswered bucket the rest of the way.
“You see some of the big swings with our team and the inexperience and youth in some areas,” Amaker said. “Zena is a junior, but being in this role is different, and this is the first time around for him. These are moments that we hope will pay dividends down the road. We will look back on this and see what we grew from.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—One night after falling flat against No. 4/3 Quinnipiac, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team took the ice against Princeton on Saturday night aiming to make a statement. And make a statement it did—just not the biggest one of the night.
The No. 7/6 Crimson skated circles around last-place Princeton in the opening period, launching 15 shots on target in the frame and finishing with a season-high 42 for the game. But Tiger goaltender Colton Phinney had a statement of his own to make.
One season removed from his 51-save performance against the Crimson at Hobey Baker Memorial Rink, Phinney stopped every shot he saw on Saturday. The only difference in the game—the one shot Phinney failed to see.
Stationed between two Tiger skaters right above the goalmouth early in the first period, Jimmy Vesey, a finalist for the Hobey Baker award last season, redirected a Desmond Bergin blast from the point past Phinney to lift Harvard to victory in the house that Hobey built.
Vesey’s goal, paired with two empty-netters from sophomore defenseman Clay Anderson and junior forward Alex Kerfoot in the game’s final minute, paved the way for a 3-0 Harvard victory, as the Crimson (4-1-1, 4-1-1 ECAC) held off a Princeton squad (1-5-0, 0-4-0) that hardly looked the part of an ECAC cellar-dweller.
“Princeton came ready to play,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “In the first period, we came out and tried to reestablish our identity…. I’m happy with our guys. We got our hard hats on again after a tough one last night.”
Having escaped the first period down only one score, the Tigers emerged from the locker room after the intermission looking like a whole new squad. Princeton generated 19 shots in the middle frame, testing sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen early and often after spending very little time in the attacking zone in the first.
Manning the crease for the first time in two weeks, Madsen was unfazed by the revitalized Tiger attack. The sophomore cut out a number of Princeton wristshots throughout the final two periods, coming up with huge stops against Tiger right wingers David Hallisey and Alex Riche to preserve his second clean sheet.
On the former chance midway through the second, Madsen thwarted Hallisey’s backhanded attempt on the doorstep with a poke-check after the sophomore made his way in on goal all alone. On the latter opportunity, Madsen left a rare rebound in front but cleaned up the mess, stoning Riche’s second-chance opportunity.
“I thought Merrick was excellent all night,” Donato said. “He looked calm down there, played a lot of good pucks out of the zone on dump-ins, and let us get out of the zone a little easier.”
Madsen’s 38-save effort may be enough to move the sophomore ahead of rookie Michael Lackey—Friday’s starter—on Donato’s goaltending depth chart. But the performance of the night belonged to the man commanding the opposing crease.
Entering the weekend with the third best save percentage in the ECAC, Phinney kept his team in contention with one timely save after another. The junior stoned Vesey seven times on the night, once following some masterful stick work from the Hobey hopeful on his left post and again on a rocket from the top of the slot.
But Vesey was not the only member of the first line to put pressure on the netminder. Phinney’s biggest save of the game came partway through the second period when co-captain Kyle Criscuolo cleanly fed Kerfoot across the crease on a 2-on-1. The junior lifted his stick hand, spun through the air, and somehow found a way to keep Kerfoot’s one-timer out of the net, keeping the score 1-0.
The Crimson first line was a force on Saturday, setting the tone for a different-looking Harvard lineup which saw junior forwards Tyler Moy and Luke Esposito skate on the second line for the first time all year with senior Colin Blackwell out for the weekend.
‘We stopped trying to make too many plays through the neutral zone, got it down low, and started to play the way we were playing last year,” said Criscuolo about his line. “[We] played below the circles…because ECAC hockey, you’ve got to play down low.”
The score line remained the same until Princeton coach Ron Fogarty was forced to call his team’s most valuable player to the sideline, enabling Anderson and Kerfoot to hit the open net. Anderson hurled the puck the length of the ice to double the Crimson’s lead with 56 seconds remaining, and Kerfoot delivered a second score with 20 ticks left to seal Harvard’s fourth win of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning to the comfort of Bright-Landry after a weekend away from home, the No. 9/9 Harvard women’s ice hockey team (5-1-1, 5-1-1 ECAC) extended its winning streak, cruising to a 5-0 victory against cellar dweller Union (0-9-4, 0-4-2) before pulling out a come-from-behind win against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (4-7-1, 2-3-1).
HARVARD 2, RENSSELAER 1
With the sides tied at one going into the final stanza, the Crimson offense piled on the pressure, sending shot after shot at Engineer goaltender Lovisa Selander. Seven minutes later, Harvard was finally rewarded.
Junior Brianna Mastel swung the puck around off the boards to classmate Sydney Daniels, who managed to get off a short pass behind the goal to sophomore Haley Mullins. Mullins shook off her defender before filtering it to the top of the crease to a waiting Miye D’Oench, who slapped it into the back of the net.
It was the fifth goal of the season for the senior, sending the Crimson to its fifth straight win in what ended up being a game dominated by the defense.
“We battled hard,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We were on our toes the majority of the game…. We got some penalties that made it a little tricky—it shortens up your bench pretty quick when you have to kill a lot of penalties like that, but we weathered the storm.”
The Engineers got on the board first, as rookie Taylor Schwalbe capitalized on RPI’s man-advantage following a hooking penalty by senior Jessica Harvey. Senior Mina Mankey fired a shot from the left faceoff circle at co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer, who failed to contain it, allowing Schwalbe to poke the rebound in.
Facing its first deficit in almost 240 minutes of play, Harvard needed to respond after failing to kill RPI’s power play. It took all of two minutes for that response to arrive.
Controlling the puck just inside the blue line, Mastel rocketed a shot at goal that was redirected by Harvey into the back of the net, evening the score.
It was the seventh straight game a stingy Crimson defense contained its opponents to two goals or less, as Maschmeyer picked up her first win of the season while tallying a season-high 32 saves to help the team pull out a close contest.
“You always want to get the first goal, but it’s not going to happen all the time,” co-captain Michelle Picard said. “We have so much confidence in ourselves that we can bounce back, and we did, so that was great.”
HARVARD 5, UNION 0
The Harvard offense was firing on all cylinders on Friday, as five different players found the net in a rout of a winless Union squad.
“We came out ready to go all the way through the lineup,” Stone said. “We had three lines firing pretty well tonight…. Overall we had a very comprehensive victory.”
After bombarding the Dutchwomen net for the first 15 minutes of the game, the Crimson finally broke through when freshman Kaitlin Tse found Mastel at the point. The junior fired a laser at goal, and the puck ricocheted off a Union player before finding the back of the net.
The lead would double less than four minutes later, as Picard played the puck between herself and sophomores Karly Heffernan and Lexie Laing before firing a slapshot into the bottom right corner to convert on the power play opportunity.
D’Oench would get in on the goal scoring to start the second frame, as Mullins raced down the left wing before drilling a shot at Union netminder Leah Patrick less than half a minute into the period. Patrick failed to control the shot, allowing D’Oench to shovel the loose puck into the net.
The lead would extend even further before the end of the frame, as Heffernan skated down the length of the ice before firing a shot that found the twine. Daniels would wrap up the scoring for Harvard in the final stanza, as the junior redirected a shot from D’Oench past Patrick to give the Crimson a 5-0 victory.
Harvard dominated all aspects of the game, outshooting the Dutchwomen 39-18 and winning 29 faceoffs compared to just 18 for a Union squad that could not keep up with the depth of the Crimson. Netminder Brianna Laing picked up the victory on a quiet night for the junior, who only had to make 10 saves on the night.
“It was an awesome effort all around,” D’Oench said. “Defensively to get the shutout is huge for us, and for the first time we really felt the extent of our offensive firepower…. Scoring from the blue, scoring from the forward, that was awesome.”
