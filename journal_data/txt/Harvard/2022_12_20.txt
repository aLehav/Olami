After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Massachusetts Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III will remain on the Harvard Institute of Politics’ Senior Advisory Committee while he serves as special envoy to Northern Ireland, according to two sources close to Kennedy.
With Kennedy remaining on the committee, a member of the Kennedy family will continue to advise the institute founded as a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy ’40 — preserving a long-standing relationship that has grown rocky amid clashes between members of the family and Harvard administrators.
Kennedy, a Harvard Law School graduate, will serve as the special envoy to Northern Ireland, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken ’84 announced in a State Department press statement Monday morning.
The appointment marks a return to politics for Kennedy, who left office in 2021 after he staged an unsuccessful challenge to incumbent Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in the 2020 Democratic primary.
Kennedy wrote in a tweet that the appointment is an “incredible honor” and that he will work with the Biden administration “to reaffirm US commitment to Northern Ireland and to promote economic prosperity and opportunity for all its people.”
Unlike other members of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee who were tapped to serve in the Biden administration, Kennedy will not need to depart the IOP because his role as special envoy is a part-time position, according to the two sources.
Two former Senior Advisory Committee members — U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Jeff Flake and U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Sarah A. Bianchi ’95 — both departed the IOP after they were sworn into office late last year.
Members of the Kennedy family have played an active role on the advisory committee since the Institute’s founding in 1966, but in recent years, the Kennedy family’s influence at the Harvard Kennedy School and the IOP has diminished.
Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 resigned from the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee in February 2020, leaving Joseph Kennedy III as the sole Kennedy family member on the committee. A 2021 Crimson investigation revealed Caroline Kennedy’s departure stemmed from concerns about the governance and leadership of the IOP.
Joseph Kennedy III is taking on the role amid an ongoing dispute between the United Kingdom and the European Union over the Northern Ireland Protocol, a post-Brexit deal that prevented the establishment of a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Blinken, a former Crimson Editor, said in his statement that Kennedy will further “economic development and investment opportunities” and foster relationships between Northern Ireland and the United States.
“His role builds on the long-standing U.S. commitment to supporting peace, prosperity, and stability in Northern Ireland and the peace dividends of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement,” Blinken said. “I look forward to Joe’s engagement and service with the people and leaders of Northern Ireland.”
The special envoy to Northern Ireland role had not been filled since Mick Mulvaney, who previously served as acting chief of staff to President Donald J. Trump, resigned from the role on Jan. 7, 2021, following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S Capitol.
Setti D. Warren, the interim director of the IOP, wrote in a statement that “the Institute of Politics will continue to follow all appropriate federal ethics guidance as members of our Senior Advisory Committee serve our country and the American people.”
“We congratulate Rep. Kennedy on his appointment as special envoy to Northern Ireland and applaud his ongoing commitment to public service,” Warren wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The sons of businessman Jie “Jack” Zhao, who is accused of bribing an ex-Harvard fencing coach to secure their admission to Harvard, testified Monday that a love of the sport drove their father’s involvement in their fencing careers.
Prosecutors allege that Zhao paid out more than $1.5 million in kickbacks to former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand in exchange for his sons' recruitment to the College.
But on the tenth day of trial, Eric Y. Zhao ’18 and Edward Y. Zhao ’21 said they were unaware of alleged bribes between Jack Zhao and former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand, and they told jurors it was their father’s commitment to the sport that led him to build strong personal relationships with their coaches.
Brand was fired by Harvard in 2019 for violating the University’s conflict of interest policies. A year later, Brand and Zhao were indicted by a grand federal jury on bribery charges. Prosecutors allege Zhao paid a stream of bribes to Brand, including the purchase of his Needham, Mass. home for nearly twice its assessed value, payments for Brand’s son’s college tuition, and a new sports car.
Both sons said during their testimony that they did not see their father’s involvement in their fencing careers as anything out of the ordinary.
“My father’s my hero. He’s my backbone,” Edward Zhao said. “My dad really loved the sport. Sometimes, it felt like he loved it even more than I did.”
Edward Zhao pointed to the construction of a tournament-style fencing strip in their home’s basement as an example of his father’s devotion to the sons’ fencing success, adding that his father continues to follow fencing tournaments to this day, even after the siblings’ retirement from the sport.
Eric and Edward said they were aware of their father’s donations to the Harvard fencing team following their acceptances to the College, as well as his sponsorship of fencing trips to China during each son’s freshman fall. However, both siblings testified that they had no previous awareness of the alleged bribes or any payments to individuals connected to Harvard fencing.
During opening statements on Dec. 5, defense attorneys for Brand characterized the transactions between Brand and Zhao as “a friend loaning a friend money.” Brand’s wife Jacqueline Phillips testified on the eighth day of trial that the couple had planned to pay back the loans from Zhao in full with anticipated inheritance money.
Prosecutors focused on the values around Harvard’s recruiting and admissions processes during their cross-examination of the Zhao brothers. In their testimony, both brothers agreed that the recruiting process should be fair.
When Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen E. Frank ’95 asked Edward Zhao if he believed it was wrong for a parent to pay a coach to recruit a student, Zhao said he did not believe it was a “relevant” question.
Both Zhao brothers were coached by Alexandre Ryjik, who admitted on the first day of trial to serving as a “middleman” in the alleged scheme by using his foundation to funnel payments from Zhao to Brand.
Edward Zhao testified that his relationship with Ryjik began with “trust,” “fear,” and “respect,” but it became “really exhausting” toward the middle of his high school career. Zhao said he stepped back from working with the coach in his junior year of high school.
“There was constant berating on my hard work, my dedication,” Edward Zhao said. “I felt like it was best for me to kind of move on and work with Chinese Olympians.”
Eric Zhao testified that his father’s “really good relationship” with Ryjik drove the fencing coach’s commitment to training him and his brother.
“My dad would go to dinners with these people,” Eric Zhao said. “They would be texting.”
Defense attorneys sought to show that Brand faced pressure to recruit qualified athletes, fundraise, maintain alumni relationships, and cultivate a strong relationship with Janet Irons, the admissions officer for the fencing team.
The defense presented a series of letters and annual reviews between Brand and his supervisors that emphasized how fundraising was critical to the long-term health of Harvard’s fencing program. Fundraising and alumni relations were noted as a “priority for all coaches,” according to a 2015 year-end summary.
Eric Zhao testified that he took initiative to fundraise for the team as fencing captain in his junior and senior years at Harvard because the program was in danger of getting cut. When asked about the role of the fundraising group Friends of Harvard Fencing, Eric Zhao said the organization was “vital.”
“The team would not exist without it,” Eric Zhao added.
On the seventh day of trial, a co-chair of the Friends of Harvard Fencing testified that Jack Zhao was a key donor to the group, which provides more than 50 percent of the fencing team’s funding.
The Zhao sons served as the final witnesses for the trial, which is set to continue at 11 a.m. Tuesday. Attorneys are expected to present their closing statements and arguments, followed by jury deliberation.
