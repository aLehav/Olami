After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Green light spilling onto the stage and an occasional bird song evoke an idyllic day in New York City’s Central Park in 1955. A man called Max (Daniel Jenkins), shuffles through a thick scrapbook, muttering in a strange language. Is it German? Hungarian? Actually it’s “Maxperanto,” an invented language specific to him—emblematic of both the play’s Dadaist artistic influences and its often frustrating obscurantism. Within moments Max is dead of a heart attack. A narrator, the Fairytale Man (Tom Nelis), steps forward to lead us through a flashback of Max’s life from birth to death.
“The Blue Flower,” co-created by Ruth and Jim Bauer, is a musical play showing until January 8 at the American Repertory Theater’s Loeb Drama Center. The Bauers are trained in visual art and music, respectively, and “The Blue Flower” is quite obviously the product of an artist and a composer/songwriter. Driven by song and arresting images, the production often loses its own plot in the profusion of visual details and wild movement on stage.
The narrative takes place between 1889 and 1955, the dates of Max’s birth and death. Max was an artist and a witness of the Belle Epoque, World War I, the Weimar Period, and World War II and its aftermath. Capturing the spirit of all these ages in a coherent manner is an ambitious project—perhaps too ambitious. Regardless, the Bauers chose Dada as the rather disunifying theme to unite all. Max is inspired by the artist Max Beckmann. His best friend is Franz (Lucas Kavner), inspired by the German Expressionist Franz Marc, and he falls in love with two women: Hannah (Meghan McGeary), inspired by the Dadaist Hannah Höch, and Maria (Teal Wicks), inspired by Marie Curie.
Over the course of this period, art school friends Franz and Max go to Paris, where they both fall in love with the scientist Maria. Maria reciprocates Franz’s affection, and all is well until World War I begins. Franz enlists, despite Maria's protestations, and Max becomes a war correspondent. On a break in Zurich, the three friends reunite and encounter Hannah at one of her Dadaist performances. From there, the pressures and caprices of war—as well as romantic conflict—conspire to tear the four apart as the story continues through two World Wars and across multiple continents.
Despite the prolonged timeline of the play, it makes no concessions for aging: each character appears to be as old as they were when they died. Thus, Jenkins looks approximately 50 even while portraying his much younger self, while the baby-faced Kavner could easily be Max’s son. This bizarre dynamic is distracting when the friends compete with each other for Maria. When complemented by McGeary, however, Jenkins comes to life. Her verve and tightly wound energy contrast well with his more reserved mannerisms. They have a charming chemistry, especially in songs like “Eyes and Bones.”
The strengths of “The Blue Flower” are its vocals and music. The production is lyrically and musically experimental: in a number entitled “Puke” Hannah sings “I can’t possibly eat as much as I’d like to puke / into the shiny boots of jingoes making news.” Maria gets to sing the most traditional number, “Eiffel Tower.” Wicks has a lovely voice and quiet intensity; she conveys a certain pathos as she sings about a broken heart from the top of the Eiffel Tower after the end of World War I. Though “The Blue Flower” is inspired by the Dadaist movement, the band—named the “Weimarband”—inflects their music with blues and American western influences. The main motifs of their music are echoed in projected images, including clips of cowboys riding across empty plains and train tracks as seen from moving carriages. These images also serve to clarify the context and mood of the sometimes confusing plot.
The play’s frustrating ambiguities are exemplified in a climactic segment depicting the breakdown of Max and Hannah’s relationship. In an entirely wordless, five-minute scene, Max follows Maria from a wild party, supposedly to help her hang up some of Franz’s paintings. Hannah, left on her own, gets into a physical fight with the host of the party and his two diabolic minions. Eventually, Hannah escapes and collapses at home, and when Max returns, she dramatically packs up her suitcase and leaves, looking at him reproachfully.
The Bauers leave the scene open for interpretation; while it is one of the more visually compelling moments of the play, sometimes beauty must be sacrificed for clarity. In this case, where three of the main characters’ lives have just been so dramatically affected, some explanation seems necessary. This lack is especially frustrating when the plot exposition happily lingers on extraneous details, such as Max’s retaliatory response—“veni vidi vici”—to classmates who teased him at a young age. “The Blue Flower” could use more of the decisiveness encapsulated in that phrase, and less of the “Maxperanto” into which it eventually devolves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The evidence against for-profit colleges has been piling up for months, and it is disheartening that all the federal government has offered in response is pontification and paper. The schools have seen a surge in popularity, and the General Accounting Office estimates their enrollment rose from 365,000 to 1.8 million in the last several years. Unfortunately, these colleges promise their students outsize returns but instead deliver them mounds of debt. As such, it is high time for the government and accreditation boards to regulate the practices of these institutions more strictly.
A November report by the Education Trust found that for-profit colleges offer “little more than crippling debt” to their students. Only 22 percent of students at for-profit colleges graduate in six years, as opposed to 55 percent of students at public institutions and 65 percent at private, nonprofit colleges. Moreover, from 2007-2008, the median debt of those who did receive bachelor’s degrees at these colleges was $31,190, nearly double the median debt of similar students at non-profit private colleges—$17,040—and three-and-a-half times that of similar students at public institutions—$7,960.
Even more gallingly, those whom for-profit colleges enroll and sink into debt are often already the least well off in our society. Low-income students make up 50 percent of the population at for-profits; while for-profit colleges account for 12 percent of all college students, they account for 24 percent of Pell Grant recipients. The debt accrued by students at for-profit colleges, many of whom are not even graduating, is simply unacceptable.
Additionally, for-profit colleges often misstate their benefits and manipulate students into enrolling. A 2010 GAO report documented meetings between representatives of 15 for-profit colleges and undercover applicants. All 15 “made deceptive or otherwise questionable statements to GAO's undercover applicants,” and four engaged in actual fraudulent practices. For example, at a Washington certificate program, an applicant was told that barbers make from $150,000 to $250,000 a year, when most receive salaries of less than $50,000 annually. One fictitious student who registered interest in several colleges received more than 180 phone calls in one month, encouraging him/her to apply. At special risk from these colleges are our nation’s servicemen and servicewomen, who are the targets of special advertising campaigns by for-profit colleges; 36 percent of tuition payments under the 2008 G.I. Bill for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan went to for-profit colleges in the program’s first year.
For their services, for-profit colleges receive considerable amounts of federal government support. A September report by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions stated that 85 percent of the revenue of for-profit colleges comes from federal student aid, and taxpayers provide the schools $24 billion per year.
In response, we suggest that for-profit colleges with graduation rates below a certain percentage be put on accreditation probation and federal financial aid be unavailable to students. Federal aid should not go to an endeavor that will put students in a worse financial situation than when they started without receiving a diploma.
Until this happens, students should be cautious regarding advertising that emanates from these colleges. The schools are interested in sustaining their business and not necessarily in providing the best education to their clients. Given these colleges’ special targeting of vulnerable groups such as low-income students and returning soldiers, there should be a follow-up investigation to the GAO report, surveying a range of for-profit colleges across the nation to see how truthful the advertisements' claims are.
Potential students should also consider attending community colleges in lieu of for-profit institutions. Although they may not offer the same prestige as four-year degrees, many community colleges offer the same skills for better prices. The GAO report noted that one fictitious student interested in massage therapy was encouraged to take a $14,000 certificate course, even though the same course cost $520 at the local community college. Because of community colleges’ value, we applaud Obama's focus on bolstering them with more funds and governmental support. In 2009, Obama announced a $12 billion community-college initiative, and this October, Obama held a Community College Summit bringing together major donors to think about this cause—two worthy attempts to increase awareness and quality of community colleges.
Regardless of all the problems with the current system, in theory, for-profit colleges provide a valuable service. For people serving abroad in the armed forces, or for those who are stuck at home for another reason, for-profit colleges’ flexibility in course timing and type make them viable in a way that community colleges often are not. However, at present, for-profit colleges are performing far below this ideal, and the government has a responsibility to make sure it is not funding institutions that seem to be manifestly harming their students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine a world where people are free to say whatever they want, to whomever they want, with absolutely no fear of the repercussions. Imagine no more, because that is the reality of cyberspace today. Around the country, computers are being used as weapons. Nearly half of all kids claim they have been bullied online, and more than a third say that they have been threatened online. And cyberbullying is not just an issue among kids who don’t know any better displaying their immaturity in a public forum. One would hope that Harvard students would be well above sinking to this level, but as shown by numerous websites created and used by Harvard students, this is not the case.
The most recent example of this is Harvard Top Ten. The site, which allows users to create and contribute to top 10 lists concerning Harvard, was taken down a few hours after it launched because of derogatory lists and comments. Lists like “Top Ten Harvard Douchebags” called out specific students in an obviously negative way. Other seemingly positive lists such as “Most Interesting Harvard Woman” quickly turned sour, as people who disagreed with the names listed posted, in response, “so and so sucks.” Additionally, last year’s “Fifteen Hottest Freshmen” article in The Crimson saw readers anonymously posting negative comments about the attractiveness of the choices.
It seems as if every open-source Harvard Internet forum is plagued with these problems. A HarvardFML post a few days ago read “Didn’t do Primal Scream yesterday because I’m too fat. FML.” In response, along with constructive comments, user SF posted: “Your comment does not merit any sympathy, if that is for what you are looking. Lose weight; it really is not that hard.” This comment was “liked” five times. Or take an anonymous comment to a HarvardFML post about switching concentrations: “FYL cuz your stupid.” Although most likely made in jest, these comments on Harvard Top Ten, The Crimson’s website, and HarvardFML all fit the definition of cyber-bullying, and this is deeply troubling. In line with a March 2010 decision by the California Second Court of Appeals, which ruled against negative banter left on a Harvard-Westlake student’s website, statements like these can be grounds for a legal cyber-bullying claim.
And more importantly, these comments are just plain hurtful. In all honesty, what was the point of the HarvardFML comment on concentrations above? To insult the random original poster about switching majors? Or was it to make the commenter feel better about himself? As Harvard students, and more importantly as human beings, the anonymity of the web does not allow us to abuse our first amendment rights. We should not say things simply because we have the right to say them. As a school that perpetually preaches diversity and tolerance, Harvard ought to have a special commitment to end cyber-bullying. We often serve as a role model for other students and schools, and to allow the virtual bullying among our student body to continue would be a disservice to our school’s philosophy.
Yes, the anonymity of the web can sometimes be a good thing. In Iran, where an oppressive government often tries to silence the voice of its people, the web’s anonymity allows Iranians to blog or write without fear of repercussions. Additionally, emotionally distraught individuals can blog and post on others’ blogs to help relieve their emotions.
However, as clichéd as it is to say, with great power comes great responsibility, and the Internet has given the power of anonymous expression to millions of individuals around the world. So the next time you read a post on HarvardFML and feel the need to write back, think about this first: If your name was to be permanently attached to whatever you wrote, would you still go ahead and write it?

When the full discography of the Beatles was released on iTunes recently, I was prompted to remember the last time that I bought a music CD. I couldn’t. Nor could I remember, for that matter, the last time I illegally downloaded music. All the new music that I want to listen to is available freely and legally on the Internet via links on blogs and websites such as elbo.ws, The Hype Machine, and Pitchfork. Innovative music artists have broken free of the old economic model of only marketing CDs through concerts, and by embracing the Internet, they have increased their fan base.
Yet many artists, especially those whose business plans are pioneered by record-label executives, have not. And neither has our government’s policy regarding the distribution and reuse of music. According to recent figures, total revenue from U.S. music sales and licensing dived to $6.3 billion in 2009 from $14.6 billion in 1999 . Traditional notions of business in the music industry no longer work. Artists and record labels must recognize that how, when, and where consumers listen to music has changed from 10 years ago. These artists and record labels should look to the vibrancy of the Internet music scene as an example of how to achieve economic success. The government has to change its policies regarding the redistribution of music and enforcement of copyright law, too. After all, the new economic paradigm is only unfair to those who do not put in the effort to adapt to it.
The behavior of consumers in the music industry has irrevocably changed from when I was in the third grade. My hip and young homeroom teacher once asked each of us to bring in a CD with our current favorite pop song on it (I brought in Ricky Martin’s Greatest Hits—don’t ask, “Livin’ La Vida Loca” is catchy, OK?) so that she could create a compilation for the class. This is when “ripping” and “burning” CDs still had the vibe of a new and sexy technological dark art. If she were doing the same thing today, she would probably ask us to email her our favorite song and then post a downloadable mix in a zip file on the school server rather than burn a CD for each student. Times have changed.
And Kanye West knows this. That is why he posted every single song on his newly released album, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” to be downloaded for free in the months and weeks before the actual album was released. That’s also why he created a short film, entitled “Runaway,” that includes music from the new album and posted it to YouTube. And why he went to the headquarters of Facebook and Twitter in late July and performed live previews of songs on his albums for the employees there—so that they could videotape them and spread them virally on the Internet.
It’s not just Kanye. Statistics show that people will buy music if they hear it first and like it. Radiohead took a leap of faith three years ago with their album, “In Rainbows.” They released it on the Internet for whatever price people were willing to pay, including nothing. It ended up topping the charts in the U.S. and U.K. Newer artists who meddle in remixing, including Chiddy Bang and Girl Talk, have released copious amounts of their music, if not all of it, for freely available download on the Internet. As a result, they have achieved critical and commercial success.
The new album from Girl Talk (a.k.a. Greg Gillis), “All Day,” is made up of 372 overlapping samples of other musical artists’ work. He has not licensed these samples, most of which are less than10 seconds long, from their creators. Yes, those artists did come up with the tiny bits of music he peruses, and copyright should protect creative works of art. But out of the infinite possibilities of recombining their music, Gillis came up with the album “All Day.” Our current copyright laws criminalize Gillis for the creation of this album and as such demean his creation as not artwork. Any listener knows that this is an unjust classification.
The behavior of individuals has driven the transition to the new way that things are done in the world of music. People download music legally from their favorite websites, buy what they like off of iTunes, put it on their iPods, and go about their lives. Meanwhile, stacks of CDs grow dusty in the basements of their homes. The bank accounts of record labels grow empty and the courts fill up with lawsuits criminalizing a new generation of artists. It’s time for these institutions to catch up with the times.

The year that is just ending, although perhaps marginally better than 2009, has brought little to celebrate. There’s been the earthquake in Haiti, the disastrous BP oil spill, unimpressive unemployment statistics, and setbacks in Afghanistan. For the less politically savvy, 2010 might be remembered as the year Conan lost his show, “Lost” ended with many unresolved questions, and Transportation Security Authority employees saw us all naked over Thanksgiving.
It’s no surprise that, in this bleak political and financial climate, a renegade free-speech bomb thrower from down under has emerged as a folk hero. Julian Assange, the self-styled “editor-in-chief” of the new media non-profit WikiLeaks, famous for publishing classified documents, represents the promise that we can still make the world a better place.
The current of popular support for Assange extends much deeper than the superficial claims of solidarity issued by foreign dignitaries, who had a good chuckle after the US diplomatic cables revealed that officials called Russia’s Dmitry Medvedev “Robin to Putin's Batman.” Assange has been voted among “50 People Who Matter 2010” by the New Statesman, a British magazine, and he won the popular vote for Time Magazine’s 2010 Person of the Year. On Internet message boards, Assange has been hailed as a conquering hero and has been given the blessing of hacker groups like 4chan.org’s Anonymous movement, which has been shutting down bank websites on his behalf.
Whether or not he has been intentionally cultivating his celebrity, Assange has been very successful at gaining attention. With his shockingly white hair, tucked carelessly behind his ears, and an impish smirk, Assange looks like a messenger from another era—a strange hybrid of Andy Warhol and Legolas from the Lord of the Rings. His adventures in hacking computer networks as a teen add to his “bad boy” pedigree. When responding to his retractors, he speaks with the fiery diction of a revolutionary, accusing U.S. military leaders of “wading in the blood” of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And like any good countercultural leader, the Australian Assange has no permanent home, having lived in Kenya and Tanzania as well as sharing a house with other activists in Iceland earlier this year.
In fact, his international escapades are what led him to hot water: accusations of offences related to sexual encounters with two women in Sweden. His supporters allege that the charges have been trumped up to bring a dangerous radical under control. Assange was released on bail yesterday after nine days of incarceration in London, and is currently fighting extradition to Sweden.
If anything, his trouble with the law only adds to his reputation as a crusader for the common people, fighting against the vested interests of political authorities, although it is shameful to see supporters of free speech and democracy so casually brush aside allegations of sexual abuse.
Assange’s fame transcends his role as a free-speech activist because the story of his struggle resonates with all of us. A study at the University of South Florida several years ago confirmed what had been suspected since David and Goliath: underdogs have an innate appeal. Using sports and politics as examples, the researchers found that the disadvantaged party in any confrontation arouses the sense of fairness and justice in spectators, especially when the underdog has to use more effort.
Assange’s solo confrontation against the governments of Sweden, Britain, and now the United States, hoping to bring a case against him after the release of the diplomatic cables, makes him a perfect underdog specimen. The fact that his organization is dependent on donations and has struggled with money in the past completes the picture of an underdog activist facing long odds.
Finally, although Assange’s WikiLeaks is not without problems, not least of which are its own transparency issues, its mission is a good one. While the argument can be made that releasing sensitive documents, such as the US diplomatic cables, will set back the cause of democratic advancement in the short run, it is easy to see that organizations like WikiLeaks promote freedom and equality in the long run by preventing governments from sweeping their dark deeds under the rug.
Even the most hardened skeptics of free speech activism must see that Assange and his ilk bring a message of uplift to a world besieged by war and economic woes. Though he doesn’t appeal to everyone, people everywhere have already pinned their optimism for a better world on Assange’s brand of radicalism.
While Americans count the days until companies start hiring again or until their children return from tours of duty, and people of other nations struggle through their own problems, men like Assange provide the thing we need most: hope.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several final exam blue books from Government Professor Michael J. Sandel’s mega-course “Ethical Reasoning 22: Justice” were stolen from a teaching fellow’s car earlier this week, forcing some students to retake the exam or settle for a grade based on their previous work in the course.
Sandel, whose class typically fills Sanders Theatre, notified students whose exams had been stolen yesterday that they will be able to take a different version of the test as a take-home exam over the next few days. Students can also elect to accept a grade calculated from their previous assignments, which constitute about 65 percent of the syllabus’ requirements.
It remains unclear how many of the course’s approximately 800 students were affected by the theft, which occurred after someone stole a backpack that contained a laptop and some bluebooks.
For freshmen who hoped for an easy, pain-free introduction to Harvard, yesterday’s news came as a shock and a jolt to an otherwise carefully planned academic schedule.
“I do think it’s the fairest thing they could have done, but it doesn’t help me out at all,” said Matthew D. Moellman ’14.
Though Moellman said he thinks that he did well enough on the Justice final to raise his final grade, he said he plans to take the option of basing his grade on his previous course work, as preparing for a makeup exam would detract from the time he plans to spend preparing for his other final on Monday.
The Cambridge Police Department is investigating the theft, but according to an e-mail sent to students by head teaching fellow Kerstin Haase, course administrators have little faith that the materials will be returned.
Haase said in her e-mail to students that a “handful” of books had been stolen but declined to elaborate on that number in response to questions from The Crimson.
“It sucks, but stuff happens. You’ve got to live with it and move on, it’s not the end of the world,” Moellman said. “It’s the best they could do with a really crappy situation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several alleged hate crimes targeting LGBT individuals on campus have called into question the level of tolerance at Harvard—generally touted as a liberal haven accepting of people of all identities and backgrounds—and the administration’s ability to adequately address these issues.
Noting the lack of institutional resources for LGBT affiliates, Harvard Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12 says that it is important for the University not to fall into complacency when it comes to ensuring a welcoming environment for LGBT people.
“While the general sentiment is that Harvard is a safe and liberal place, that sort of mindset can lend itself to apathy and lack of concern for engaging in LGBT activism,” Wang says, adding that the relative comfort of Harvard makes it easy to disregard the everyday reality of homophobia.
While presidents at many universities have sent letters or exhibited other signs of support, Harvard does not even have a funded resource center or paid staff dedicated to the LGBT community on campus, according to Wang.
“If Harvard is going to get positive attention for being a leading institution for academic study, it also needs to be forthcoming in information in order to conduct itself as a role model institution,” she says.
Sam J. Bakkila ’11-’12 agrees that this rift in communication has made it more difficult for the LGBT community to confront homophobia.
“People are forgetting that hate crimes really do make people feel vulnerable and targeted, and what the response has to do is make that targeted population feel comfortable and safe again,” he says.
Increased resources on campus would better equip the University when responding to LGBT hate crimes, Bakkila says. He hopes that increased awareness of homophobic acts at Harvard will lead to wider critical discussion of the implicit homophobia that the LGBT community faces on a daily basis.
A SEMESTER OF ANXIETY
A series of LGBT youth suicides in the fall brought LGBT issues to the public eye nationwide—and even on a liberal campus like Harvard, recent incidents have highlighted the persisting discrimination.
In late November, 36 LGBT-related books in Lamont Library were damaged with what was presumed to be urine, and the incident was subsequently investigated as a hate crime because of the books’ subject matter.
Though it was revealed on Monday that the damage had actually been the result of an accident and not a hate crime, the incident nevertheless struck a chord with the LGBT community.
Much earlier in the semester, a student was pursued by three men, allegedly not Harvard affiliates, who taunted him with names like “fag” and “queer.” While he was not harmed, the incident disconcerted members and allies of the LGBT community.
About a month later in October, a student from the Graduate School of Design returned to his room one evening to find the words “kill the fag” scrawled across his door in large black letters. Though a HUPD report was not released to the Harvard community, residents of the dorm—informed of the event by building administrators—were shocked that the incident took place within student housing.
“A dorm is a community where everyone is supposed to feel safe, and with that one act, someone undermined months of building a community,” says Drew H. Coyne, a Harvard School of Education student who lives in the dorm and adds that it was the least likely place he would have expected to encounter homophobia.
“This might be a call to arms for Harvard to centralize resources so LGBT students don’t feel ostracized and alone,” Coyne adds.
Prior to these events, the College had been planning to form a BGLTQ Working Group, and the announcement of its creation in October came at an opportune moment, given the national spotlight on the discrimination faced by LGBT individuals, according to Wang.
“The national landscape and the two alleged hate crimes reported at Harvard during the first month of school intensified awareness of the lack of infrastructure the College has in addressing LGBTQ issues,” Wang says.
ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSE
While the LGBT community notes that these recent incidents highlight the need for greater resources at Harvard, the administration and Harvard University Police Department say they worked to the best of their abilities to address each of these problems.
According to Kevin Bryant, HUPD’s diversity and community liaison, the police department uses the Massachusetts General Law on Interference with Civil Rights to investigate acts of bias, including those targeting LGBT individuals.
“Awareness of diversity is very, very important,” Bryant writes in an e-mail. “HUPD is committed to serving every member of our diverse community.”
He says that HUPD has diversity training sessions during which officers are invited to examine how their own cultural identity affects their relationships with others.
According to Laura Snowdon, dean of students at the Graduate School of Design, the community at Harvard is generally accepting of people of different identities, and the recent incidents do not represent the norm.
“I’m glad to say there haven’t been many cases like this at our school,” says Snowden, who helped the victim of the homophobic graffiti find alternate housing.
“We have zero tolerance for any hostile behavior toward any student or any group of students because of their identity or perceived identity.”
Assistant Dean of Student Life Susan B. Marine, who often serves as the informal point person for members of the LGBT community who do not know where to turn, says that the recent incidents belie a generally positive community setting.
“Events like these crystallize the opinions of people who feel that Harvard is not an accepting place and negates the positive things that are going on,” says Marine, who is also director of the Harvard College Women’s Center. “I’m convinced we have strong and robust community.”
Marine adds that the BGLTQ Working Group is currently working to examine the student perspectives obtained from the open forums held in each of the upperclass Houses and in the Yard over the past few weeks.
“We’re very much in the process right now of meeting and taking in all the information,” she says, anticipating that the group will move into the stage of organizing its thoughts into concrete action next semester to prepare a recommendation to be submitted to the College Dean in March.
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS OR GENUINE CONCERN?
The vulnerability heightened by the recent crimes on campus was particularly pronounced for queer students of color, according to Miguel Garcia ’12, who started the group GLOW specifically for this reason early in the semester.
Garcia says that this group was much needed, as queer students of color often face additional marginalization due to belonging to multiple minority groups. He says that he is aware of individuals who have attempted suicide because of their struggles with their intersecting identities.
“All queer people and all people of color have different stories, so it can be hard to quantify oppression and struggles,” he says. “It’s hard for queer people of color to prioritize their experience based on layers of intersectionalities, as those intersectionalities can create complications in their everyday interactions.”
Garcia also collaborated with the Latino Men’s Collective, the Black Men’s Forum, and other cultural groups, and elicited letters of apology from the boards of these groups for having formerly contributed to discriminatory practices against their LGBT membership. He continues to work with these groups and others to ensure inclusive practices.
“It’s important to me that not only is this a gesture for political correctness, but a genuine concern for the inclusion of queer people within their cultural groups, and recognizing queer identity as part of that culture,” he says.
SOLUTION SPACE
Wang echoes Garcia’s sentiment that change ought to be based not on the desire to be politically correct, but on authentic aspirations to positive change. She says that she and other members of Harvard’s LGBT community have been frustrated at not receiving consistent and clear information from the College on problems involving the LGBT community, as well as how such incidents are being investigated on an administrative level.
“It should not be the responsibility of the student or student groups to search for particulars and clarifications, as this system leads to confused, incomplete information,” she says.
Wang, who participates in the BGLTQ Working Group, says that its creation comes at a good time and the LGBT community appreciates the work it is undertaking. But the current lack of resources has hit the LGBT community hard this semester, she says.
“Moving into solution space comes only with acknowledgement of the problems, and it is my hope that Harvard has the bravery to build where it is weak, and foster acceptance for people of all identities,” Wang says.
History and Literature Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, who has been a vocal advocate of LGBT issues on campus, says he hopes that the problems encountered by LGBT individuals over the past semester can be used for positive change.
“Whenever homophobic incidents occur, we must come together as a community, find our allies, and redouble our collective efforts to eradicate any hatred, fear, or ignorance about LGBT people,” McCarthy writes in an e-mail.
“Ironically, instances of discrimination and violence can have a galvanizing effect on people of goodwill who are moved to act in the face of injustice,” he adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past year, the Harvard Corporation voted on 26 shareholder proposals from companies in which the University holds stock, including voting to make several energy companies adopt goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and taking a stand in favor of public disclosure of corporate political contributions.
The Corporation voted to make ConocoPhillips, Mirant, and Exxon Mobil write quantitative goals for reducing their emissions and report on them to shareholders, a position the Corporation considered especially important given possible future federal regulation.
These decisions are detailed in the annual report of the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, made up of three members of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—which was released Thursday.
Like any shareholder of a public company, Harvard votes on resolutions brought by shareholders in companies it partially owns.
In voting its shares, the committee considers the advice of an advisory panel of faculty, students, and alumni, which considers the issue in depth and then presents its views to the Corporation Committee.
Over the past few quarters, Harvard has directly held between $1.5 billion and $2.25 billion in U.S.-traded securities.
The 26 resolutions Harvard voted on in 2010 are up from the 19 considered last year, but down significantly from the 100-plus considered in years 2008 and earlier, a reflection of new asset allocations adopted after the financial crisis.
The committee voted in favor of making ConocoPhillips submit a semi-annual report to shareholders detailing its corporate political contributions, but abstained from voting on similar resolutions at four other companies.
The resolutions at those four businesses included a clause requiring the “identification of the person or persons...who participated in making the decisions” on political contributions. The advisory panel said “they would have supported the request” without such language, but “expressed frustration” that the clause in the proposal would single out individuals.
The committee also considered several other environmental proposals, including a proposal for Exxon Mobil to prepare a report on the impact of a new drilling procedure for natural gas known as hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.” Some environmentalists fear the process poses risks to groundwater, especially as drilling moves nearer to populated areas. The Corporation Committee abstained on that proposal after its advisory panel was split.
Several of the proposals considered by the committee concerned Google’s corporate practices.
The Corporation abstained on a proposal that would have restricted the search giant’s ability to provide user information to the Chinese government if it potentially could place individuals “at the risk of persecution.” The proposal also could have required Google to assist users in bypassing Chinese government restrictions—actions that would make Google’s continued business presence in China uncertain at best.
All of the ballot proposals supported by the Corporation failed by a wide margin in votes of all shareholders—including the proposals put to the shareholders of ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, and Google.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reverend Peter J. Gomes, who has overseen the Memorial Church for the last three and a half decades, had a stroke Dec. 10, according to Jonathan Page, a former Epps Fellow and  at Memorial Church.
Gomes, 68, was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital last week.
“I think he’s still there. He might have gone home already,” said Page, who has not spoken with Gomes, but has been in touch with others who had. Page said Gomes had been able to communicate with visitors, but “will not be preaching in the near future.”
“There’s been an attempt to make sure he doesn’t get too inundated [by visitors],” he said. “A number of people have seen in him the last week.”
A spokeswoman for Massachusetts General Hospital said Gomes was not listed on the hospital’s public registry, so she could not disclose whether Gomes had been admitted to the hospital.
By all accounts, Gomes—who planned to retire in 2012—has been a central figure at Memorial Church.
“He’s a vocal advocate for all sorts of religious expression on campus,” Page said. “He’s sort of the force of religion at Harvard in the last 35 years.”
Many affiliated with the church said they wondered how the church would fill the void created by Gomes’ absence.
“I think he’s a big reason why a lot of people go to Memorial Church,” said Helen E. Bradshaw ’11, Memorial Church’s school director. “I’ve wondered what the Church is going to be like without him.”
The Church has brought on Reverend Wendel W. Meyer as associate minister for administration. Meyer was formerly the minister at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Beverly Farms, Mass. and has previously worked at Memorial Church.
Memorial Church, where Gomes has traditionally delivered over 50 percent of the sermons, has a particularly busy schedule during the winter holidays.
“The fact that this happened at all and the fact that it happened at this time a year, which is such an important part of this community’s life, is very difficult and we’re all feeling it very strong and clearly,” said Nathaniel P. Katz, the current Epps Fellow.
Jeff Neal, spokesman for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, released a statement on behalf of the University which reads, “We were very concerned to learn about Rev. Gomes’ health, and we continue to receive updates about his progress from his friends and family. We wish him a full and speedy recovery.”
Gomes is the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church. He most recently wrote “The Scandalous Gospel of Jesus: What’s So Good about the Good News?”
This semester he taught Religion 42: “The Christian Bible and Its Interpretations” at the Harvard Divinity School and was scheduled to teach Religion 1513: “History of Harvard and Its Presidents” in the spring.

Our ability to recognize faces improves as we age, according to a new study conducted by Harvard scientists and published online in the journal Cognition earlier this month.
The results are surprising in the context of other studies on cognitive function because many such abilities—including speech perception—peak in the early 20s when brain development ends, according to Laura T. Germine, the study’s lead author.
Germine and her fellow researchers used data from over 60,000 participants who voluntarily tested their abilities using an online face memory test. The volunteers were asked to recognize the computer-generated faces of six young, adult white males.
In subsequent experiments, subjects were asked to identify photographs of women and children as well. The results were comparable regardless of the sex or age of the person in the image.
The researchers compared the recognition memory for faces to that of names, an ability which, on average ,peaks at 23 years.
“Not every cognitive ability is created equal,” said Germine, a graduate student in the Harvard psychology department.
Unlike remembering unfamiliar names, recognizing faces becomes easier as people approach their 30s. Germine said she thinks that this occurs because people are exposed to more faces as they become older, thus fine-tuning their visual recognition.
The peak was comparable for both male and female participants, although the study did not take into account the ethnicity of its participants. Furthermore, the study reveals that individuals on either side the peak age have similar capacities to recognize faces. For instance, performance at 16 is comparable to performance at 65.
Germine added that she would be interested in seeing whether the peak in the 30s applies to other social cognitive abilities, such as voice recognition.

Professor Paul E. Farmer was named the Kolokotrones University Professor yesterday, joining 22 other professors who hold the highest faculty rank.
Professor of Anthropology Arthur Kleinman, who advised Farmer while he was earning his Ph.D., said that Farmer was the “icon of global health,” and that his success is rooted in a combination of high quality academic work, a deep commitment to his projects, an inspirational approach to teaching, and a passion for hands-on work.
“He is an extraordinary professor who combines enormous talents, great energy, and a tremendous commitment both to education and to service,” Kleinman said.
Arachu Castro, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who works in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine under Farmer, said that she gave Farmer—who was “very excited” about the announcement—a hug when she heard the news.
“I think he does fantastic work,” Castro said. “I was very pleased when I heard the news, but at the same time I’m not surprised because he is so well-deserving of the [honor.]”
Divya Seth ’14 and Lily H. Ostrer ’14, both student in Farmer’s “Health, Culture, and Community: Case Studies in Global Health” class, said that they have looked up to Farmer ever since reading “Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer,” a 2004 non-fiction account of Farmer’s humanitarian efforts, in high school. Seth said that Farmer’s lectures were special because he combined “a touch of humor, an ability to connect, and [a desire to] reach out to students in the class.”
Farmer received a B.A. from Duke before earning both his Ph.D. in Anthropology and his MD from Harvard in 1990. He is chairman of Harvard Medical School’s Department of Global Health and Social Medicine and serves as the chief of the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He has established treatment programs for infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS in poor countries across the world, and he has written multiple books about HIV/AIDS, global health, and countries in which he has worked.
In 1987, Farmer co-founded Partners In Health, an NGO based at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, that strengthens health care systems in impoverished nations by partnering with the country’s government, with the goal of achieving long-term solutions to health problems. He has worked to build health clinics, train native peoples to work in the clinics, and develop health systems in countries such as Haiti, Rwanda, Peru, and Russia.
Seth said she admires Farmer because he “never put limits on [his dream],” by not limiting Partners In Health to Haiti, but extending the organization to help a dozen countries.
“He is changing the social aspect of medicine while addressing biological needs,” Seth said.
University President Drew G. Faust commended Farmer for his excellence in multiple areas when announcing the appointment yesterday.
“Paul Farmer is best known to the public as a pioneering humanitarian,” Faust said. “He is also an outstanding educator with a remarkable capacity to inspire students to focus their minds and their energies on serving the common good.”

Staff evacuated a computer lab in the basement of the Science Center after a student spilled mercury on a desktop at approximately 3:30 p.m. on Thursday.
The student immediately reported the spill of the mercury—a chemical element that is liquid at room temperature—and the lab, room B14, was evacuated quickly thereafter, according to Assistant Director of the Science Center John B. Mathers.
The student had the mercury in his possession for no particular reason, according to Mathers. “It was something a friend gave him some time ago that he happened to have in his bag,” he said.
Byron T. Hood ’13, who was working at the support desk in the lab at the time of the incident, said that many people were not in the room when the spill occurred and that the evacuation proceeded “very smoothly.”
“All [the] people left reasonably quickly without much fuss,” Hood said.
Mercury spills happen frequently around campus, according to Mathers. He said that when spills like Thursday’s occur, the University hires a private contractor that specializes in the removal of hazardous waste to clean up the spill.
On Thursday afternoon, Mathers said that the lab would be closed that day to students until 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., or until the air was safe to breathe.
“Mercury is a hazardous substance,” he said. “It forms vapor very readily, so you don’t want to breathe it more than you have to.”
Hood said that he thought it was “awfully unsafe” for a student to bring mercury into the computer lab. “Mercury should probably be restricted to labs,” he said.
Though students are not supposed to bring hazardous materials such as mercury into the lab, Mathers said that the Science Center nevertheless has a policy in place to properly respond to chemical spills.
“Our policy is as soon as mercury is spilled, we got to clean it up,” Mathers said. “We got to remove people from the area so they don’t breathe.”
Mathers declined to identify the student involved in the mercury spill.

A team of Harvard researchers has created a new tool that analyzes language patterns in published books to quantify cultural and historical trends from 1800 to 2000.
The innovative research tool made its debut yesterday in an article titled “Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books,” which was published online in the journal Science and launched as a feature on Google.
Dubbed “culturomics,” the tool enables the public to use the Google Books database as a “genome of culture,” according to Adrian Veres ’12, one of the article’s authors.
“Fundamentally speaking, you can see what society is interested in by tracking the frequency of the word,” Veres said. “The more common the word, the more important it is.”
Google’s launching of the online tool will allow users to type in a word or a phrase and see how their usage has changed over the past two centuries.
Google Books is a set of digitized texts that includes about 4 percent of all books ever printed. While more than 70 percent of the books are printed in English, the database also includes texts in French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Russian, and Hebrew.
This publicly accessible database provides a “quantitative aspect to the social sciences and the humanities that has never been paralleled before,” said Veres, adding that he believes published books provide important historical insights, as they reveal traces of culture as perceived by people.
“These books are a meaningful representation of what’s important at [a specific] time,” he said.
In addition to discussing how the tool was conceived, the article showcases the type of analysis it provides. For example, users can see how language and grammar have evolved, how lexicography and censorship have trended over time, and how individuals have garnered fame by elucidating the frequency of their names in published works.
Psychology Professor Steven Pinker, a co-author of the article, noted the academic significance of the tool, which will enable linguists to see how often and in what context certain words were used.
“The tool revolutionizes the humanities by answering questions about the influence of humans and ideas quantitatively,” said Pinker, who focused in the article on past tense and lexical ‘dark matter’—a term that describes infrequently used words that do not appear in standard dictionaries.
Led by two Harvard affiliates, Jean-Baptiste Michel and Erez Lieberman-Aiden, the team included researchers from Harvard, Google, Encyclopaedia Britannica, and the American Heritage Dictionary.

Each Thursday (natch, Friday), The Crimson will compile a series of unique statistics about Harvard's sports scene. Welcome to the Magic of Numbers—without the problem sets. We'll do the math for you.
CRIMSON VS. HUSKIES
 
2009 – Year that UConn’s men’s basketball team last made an appearance in the NCAA tournament. The Huskies have made 28 postseason appearances in the history of the program. Harvard looks to extend its two-game win streak when it heads on the road to take on UConn next Wednesday. The game will be nationally televised on ESPN3.
64 – Number of years since the Crimson’s sole appearance in the NCAA tournament (1946).
8 – Number of wins for the Huskies this season. UConn has gone undefeated in its first eight games to start this season and is ranked fourth in the nation in both the AP Top 25 and USA Today Coaches’ Polls.
28.1 – Points per game for the Huskies’ leading scorer, guard Kemba Walker. Walker is ranked second in the nation in scoring and is also shooting over 40 percent from beyond the three-point line.
16.6 – Points per game for Harvard’s leading scorer, sophomore guard Christian Webster. Webster leads the Ivy League in scoring and is shooting exactly 40 percent from downtown.
13 – Number of former UConn players currently playing in the NBA.
1 – Number of former Crimson basketball players currently playing in the NBA. Jeremy Lin ’10 became the first Harvard player to play in the NBA in 57 years when he signed with the Golden State Warriors this past summer after going undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft.

For Radcliffe alum Esther Lofgren '07-'09, 2010 keeps getting better and better. Already a world champion, the rower gained further recognition for her crew's performance when the US national team women's 8+ was nominated for row2k's crew of the year. On Nov. 7 in Lake Karapiro, New Zealand, Lofgren's eight took the competition by storm, winning the world championships by a margin of nearly four seconds. The race capped off a strong year for the women's 8+, which also won at the World Cup stop in Lucerne, Switzerland.
Lofgren stroked the women's eight in Lucerne but moved to the five seat for the World Championships. Meanwhile, the current leaders in the fan voting, the U23 pair of Ashley Kroll and Felice Mueller, were guided by Harvard's own Linda Muri. Muri, coach of the Crimson lightweight freshmen, coached the U23 women's pair, four, and eight this summer, helping all three boats win gold in their respective events. Radcliffe co-captain Olivia Coffey was a member of that women's eight.
