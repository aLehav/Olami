After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This year, graduating seniors seem sophomoric. At least, that seems the consensus view of the commentariat, from the New York Times to the New York Post and everything in between.
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice bowed out of delivering the commencement address at Rutgers University because of her role in the Iraq War; former University of California at Berkeley chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau withdrew from a commencement speech at Harverford College over protests for the university’s suppression of an Occupy rally in 2011; Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, took a knee when protestors at Smith College accused her organization of supporting “imperialist and patriarchal systems that oppress and abuse women worldwide.”
Here at Harvard, students have similarly protested the selections of former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as commencement speaker for the College and Colorado State Senator Michael C. Johnston as speaker for the Graduate School of Education—though no last-minute surprises are expected.
All around, these expressions of student activism are being dismissed and derided as bigoted, whimsical, and censorious—the latest chapter of the Millennial generation’s self-absorption and overindulgence in political correctness at the expense of the freedom of expression essential to academic life. This kneejerk condemnation is flawed.
Freedom of expression is a two-way street. In all of these protests, students are answering speech with speech—those who condemn protests are just as guilty of intolerance of free expression as the ones they accuse. In the words of Professor Richard O. Lempert, writing for the Brookings Institution, “If we value openness to controversial people and ideas, we must similarly value openness to speech that challenges what controversial people have said or done.”
Of course, this does not mean that such protests are beyond criticism, so long as it focuses on substance and not style. For example, revoking the address of Lagarde, one of the world’s most powerful women, before a premier women’s college for the unexplained reason of furthering the patriarchy seems a much more dubious and unpersuasive argument than advocating for a rescindment of an honorary degree at Brandeis University to Ayaan Hirsi Ali for calling Islam a “nihilistic cult of death.”
Part of the problem appears to lie with universities that waver in the face of protest, leaving planned speakers in limbo. Rather than naming a name and then sitting silent, universities should play a more active role in refereeing the campus discussion. 
One of the best reactions to such controversy was the Ed School’s decision to not only reiterate support for Senator Johnston but also arrange for him to host an open forum in order to discuss his controversial policies. No one is deprived of speech, and the critics get a chance to hear their questions answered.
Critics of the commencement protests appeal to the sanctity of freedom of expression in our society. On the day that ultimately celebrates the students’ accomplishments, they should recognize that that freedom extends to students as much as it does to the speaker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When you look through your friends’ pictures, you might get the feeling that you can see when they’re genuinely happy and when they’re just faking a smile.
You probably can. When people express genuine, or Duchenne, smiles (named after the French neurologist who discovered them), their eyes and cheeks contract in a way that is largely involuntary, brought about only by pleasant feelings. In contrast, the fake, or Pan Am smile (named after those perpetually photo-friendly stewardesses), involves only muscle movement around the mouth.
With over 3,000 pictures being uploaded to Facebook every second, there are undoubtedly more smiles being shared than ever before. But whether these are Pan Ams or Duchennes and whether they’re leading to more smiles are separate issues. My concern is that we haven’t fully considered the inherent embellishment and temptations in social media, and so are letting it dilute our experiences.
Why are these temptations built into the fabric of social media? Maybe it moves too quickly and too slowly. Online profiles ask us to slash, shrink, summarize, and snip a few moments of our lives for people who will be scrolling through them briefly. But at the same time, when creating our profiles, we have a huge block of time in which we can deliberate and tailor how we appear. Since few want to broadcast blemishes and regrets, we cherry-pick our qualities. We publicize flattering pictures and exciting moments. The monotonous and mundane, the quotidian and commonplace, are omitted and unseen. And even if we don’t want to misrepresent ourselves, the knowledge that future employers could view our profiles makes the neglect of controversial or unfavorable material understandable.
While these accelerated and sluggish aspects of social media move at different paces, they follow the same path: We project who we want to be rather than who we are.
Several studies have linked Facebook use to dissatisfaction and depression. These results, while undesirable, are unsurprising. When we view other profiles—themselves neat, clean products of a few cherry-picked vacations—we see the exceptional and mistake it for the ordinary. We know the less desirable aspects of our own lives, and feel boring by comparison—even if our profiles contribute to the same feelings of envy in others.
It’s worth noting that there isn’t some intrinsic problem with deliberating on how to project yourself or emphasizing likeable qualities. When you write a love letter, you linger over every phrase. The problem arises when we mistaken these deliberate profiles as accurate representations of the people behind them.
They’ve been heavily seasoned, so we should take them with a grain of salt.
But perhaps more important that reflecting on how social media shapes our expectations is being careful about how it affects our experiences. Because of social media, ideas can get more attention, more quickly than ever before. Now, I don’t think there is anything wrong with enjoying attention—it feels good when our ideas influence others or our accomplishments are recognized.
But I do think we should always question our motivations, especially when acting for the sake of attention, so we don’t sacrifice genuine development or an enjoyable experience for superficial validation and cheap affirmation. Do people really get more out of a concert by watching it through their four-by-six inch pixilated screen? Does ice cream really taste better after its picture has been uploaded to Instagram? 
My guess is no. A recent study found that taking photographs of objects hurts our ability to remember details about them. Now, pictures can be powerful tools for reminding us of experiences, but not when sharing becomes the whole point of an experience, a justification rather than an after-thought.
There is a fine balance between living in the moment and being able to remember the moment. That balance is broken when we have to interrupt the moment in the order to show others that we were in it.
The expedited process of sharing experiences through social media means that we need to level our expectations and reflect on our motivations. If we let the desire to broadcast a Pan Am prevent us from experiencing a Duchenne, and this in turn makes others feel uninteresting by comparison, everyone loses. We may be broadcasting the best of ourselves through social media, but maybe it’s social media that’s getting the best of us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The debate over divestment has taken on a surreal quality as people dither about whether selling stock is an effective method to avoid planetary catastrophe.  For example, in her statement to the Harvard community, President Drew Faust belittled the tactic, writing that “divestment is likely to have negligible financial impact on the affected companies.”  Her point is true—and irrelevant.  No one has ever claimed otherwise.  The key to divestment’s power is not that it robs companies of phantom pennies, but that it forces individuals and institutions to confront the moral dilemma of accepting cash from truly destructive firms.  And, when sustained, it can jolt a paralyzed political system back to life.
Let’s examine the first effect.  According to the traditional “Wall Street Rule” investors signal their approval of management by holding stock and their disapproval by selling it.  By receiving millions of dollars in dividends and returns from companies determined to drill for more fuel no matter what the damage to the climate, Harvard is very publicly endorsing their business mission and model.
The argument over effectiveness is often used to distract us from the deeper debate over hypocrisy.  No one would argue today that if the sale of a single plantation could not, by itself, have ended slavery, then Harvard would have been morally justified to remain an owner in such a genocidal enterprise.  Climate change has already turned deadly, threatening the homes and lives of hundreds of millions of human beings through storms, drought, disease, and sea level rise.  If benefiting from a genocidal practice like slavery was wrong 150 years ago, why should profiting from the suicidal behavior of the fossil fuel industry be acceptable today?  Harvard’s willingness to rely on the dividends and stock appreciation from companies openly committed to a path of unprecedented destruction in its endowment taints its mission, its values, and its core identity.
Equally important, we know from history that divestment is, in fact, effective in creating political change.  We must remember that there is a difference in impact between a solitary act of conscience and a cumulative campaign.  Though no single vote is likely to decide a national election, cumulative votes do.  No one believed in the South African case that an individual act of conscience would succeed by itself.  But history demonstrates that acts of leadership and conscience could aggregate into political transformation in the United States and then in South Africa.
Because of South African divestment, hundreds of universities, religious institutions, foundations, and other leadership organizations were forced to address the question of their ties with major corporations whose behavior in South Africa contradicted the investors’ own mission and values.  This steadily changed the views of U.S. political leaders and brought direct pressure to bear on American firms to end their material and financial support of the South African military.
The pressure took many forms.  Ned Regan, the comptroller of New York State and the sole trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund with more than $20 billion in assets declined to divest, began appearing at the annual meetings of major corporations demanding that they withdraw from South Africa. Later, the U.S. Congress, in which the Senate was controlled by the Republican Party, passed massive new sanctions through the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986.  President Reagan vetoed the bill on the grounds that the white government had been an important ally against communism.  In an astonishing act of political rebellion within a single party, Senate Republicans listened not to their popular president but to the national outcry triggered by violence in South Africa and by the calls for divestment—and they chose to override his veto.
Because of divestment, major companies like Ford, General Motors, and IBM—many of which were the largest employees in the country—announced their withdrawal in 1988. This deeply rattled the self-confidence of South Africa’s business leaders, who then met with South African president F.W. de Klerk and demanded a negotiated settlement with the African National Congress.  In the aftermath of Nelson Mandela’s release, he and many other leaders—on all sides of the political spectrum—pointed to external economic pressure as a key component in undermining the National Party’s half-century grip on power.
The struggle to bring a peaceful end to apartheid took an enormous effort, beginning with the brave work of South African leaders themselves, backed up by international support that emerged from the ground up and forced Western nations to reject their previous support for the National Party government.   Divestment triggered first a moral struggle within the hearts of individuals and institutions, and then a massive national debate that fundamentally altered American policy.  That—and not a tiny fluctuation in stock price—is the goal of the fossil fuel divestment campaign.
Harvard, which occupies the center stage of American higher education, has a special obligation to its own history, to its students and alumni, and to the people of the planet to step forward, to end its willingness to profit from fossil fuel, and to lead the movement to confront the devastation of climate change.  Every brick in Harvard Yard testifies to the university’s praise of intellectual boldness and moral courage in the past.  Today, in the present, Harvard must display the courage of its own convictions by choosing principle over profit and by embracing divestment, a historically proven pathway to success.

Massie is the president of the New Economy Coalition.  He received his doctorate from Harvard Business School in 1989, directed the Project on Business, Values, and the Economy at Harvard Divinity School from 1989-96, and has served as a fellow at the Kennedy School and Law School at different points in his career.  He is the author of the comprehensive history of the divestment movement, Loosing the Bonds: The United States and South Africa in the Apartheid Years, published in 1998.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last month, Harvard University joined more than a thousand other global investment institutions that have signed the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment. For students and staff who advocate Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuel companies, signing the PRI may appear to be a small and incremental step. However, as the founding Executive Director of the PRI who has spent the last decade promoting responsible investments within mainstream institutions, I believe it is a huge step forward—and its implications shouldn’t be underestimated.
The Principles for Responsible Investment were launched by Kofi Annan in 2006 at the New York Stock Exchange. The six aspirational principles include commitments to incorporate environmental, social and governance issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices. Signatory institutions also commit to encouraging transparency from the entities in which they invest and being transparent themselves.
It is important to recognize that the principles are not based on ethical or normative standards, but are very much process based. It doesn't mandate divestment of “unethical” companies, but rather commits signatories to understanding a range of issues that investors have traditionally ignored, and then making investment decisions based on that understanding. For example, a typical implementation of the principles might involve hiring dedicated staff with expertise on sustainability issues, buying in research on different themes, and incorporating that research into investment decisions. It also commits investors to engaging in dialogue with investee companies (shareholder engagement) where issues of concern have been identified. 
While these types of activities may appear incremental, my experience has been that when an organization puts in place systems and staff to implement the principles, it typically results in a vast improvement on “traditional” investment in terms of sending signals to companies that sustainability and good governance matter to shareholders. 
So why is Harvard signing the PRI a huge deal, both for Harvard and the responsible investment movement overall?
First, the PRI is a public commitment backed by a mandatory reporting framework. Given Harvard’s high profile, it is unlikely that it would have signed if it weren’t serious about implementing the principles. Institutional change takes time, but the hiring of a VP of Sustainable Investing followed by signing the PRI six months later shows that things are starting to move.
In addition, it will set an example for other endowments. While many pension funds and fund managers have embraced responsible investment, most endowments have shown little interest. Harvard’s is the largest U.S. university endowment in the world, and the first to sign the PRI (see full list of signatories). Leadership and peer pressure are key in moving responsible investment forward; after the largest pension fund in Brazil signed the PRI, the rest of the industry followed. Now companies controlling 60 percent of pension assets in Brazil have signed. Similar examples of leadership resulted in major shifts in attitudes in Australia, South Africa, Japan, Canada and much of Western Europe.
And investment managers and consultants follow their clients. There is an entire sub-industry of fund managers, consultants, and advisors who serve the endowment market. Most of these organizations are yet to engage meaningfully with responsible investment. Harvard’s public commitment to this agenda is likely to catalyze dozens of new responsible investment products and services.
The PRI is a legitimizing tool for internal champions who want to push things forward. Institutions are not monolithic. There is a broad spectrum of competing views within institutions and the PRI empowers those pushing for change. The PRI’s UN backing and the size and legitimacy of its existing signatory base make responsible investment the norm, undermining those who still believe that there is no place for social issues within investment management.
The PRI prioritizes transparency. Endowments, including Harvard’s, have traditionally been woefully opaque. In most cases, secrecy and opacity have a lot more to do with culture than a genuine investment rationale. While it won’t happen overnight, the PRI’s mandatory transparency framework should result in a dramatic increase in transparency around investment processes, and more importantly, start to change attitudes towards openness and transparency. Before the PRI, the number of mainstream investors reporting anything on sustainable investment could be counted on two hands. In 2015, more than 1,000 PRI signatories will be reporting their responsible investment activities and progress in quite some detail to the public.
The PRI has a strong focus on shareholder engagement—that is, engaging proactively with investee companies on environmental and social issues across all asset classes. While climate change is hugely important, there are also many other issues that responsible investors are engaging with investee companies on, including human rights and labor standards in supply chains, gender diversity on corporate boards, anti-corruption, biodiversity loss, excessive executive remuneration, conflict minerals, corporate sustainability reporting, and more.
If Harvard gets serious about shareholder engagement, joining with the most progressive pension funds and fund managers around the world, and brings its endowment peers along, it would make a major contribution to the signals being sent to the corporate sector about investors’ concerns about sustainability and good governance issues. Given its large private equity, timberland, and property allocations, it has even more potential influence on investee companies than most institutional investors. 
A real commitment to implementing the PRI by Harvard—even though it does not yet include divestment from fossil fuel companies—does represent a major step forward in terms of the responsible investment of the entire portfolio. I predict we will see a lot of progress over the next year, not only at Harvard but also within the endowment space overall. Time will tell.

Dr. E. James M. Gifford is Senior Fellow at the Initiative for Responsible Investment at the Harvard Kennedy School.

To inaugurate the opening of its renovated facility this upcoming November, the Harvard Art Museums will present a special exhibition featuring Mark Rothko’s “Harvard Murals,” a set of five works by the abstract expressionist that were once on display in the Holyoke Center.
Including the five murals commissioned by the University, the exhibition will display 38 of Rothko’s works created between 1961 and 1962 and many of the artist’s related studies on paper and canvas, according to a press release by the Harvard Art Museums.


In the 1980s, Harvard conservators began to restore the murals, which were unevenly faded during the 1960s and 1970s as a result of light exposure while the paintings were on display in the Holyoke Center’s penthouse dining hall.
During the 1980s, conservators assessed why the murals’ colors faded so quickly and eventually decided that conventional conservation techniques—such as retouching faded areas on the mural with new paint—could irreversibly damage the integrity of the works.
They decided to instead employ an innovative conservation approach that uses calibrated light to illuminate each mural, pixel by pixel, to its original color. The technique, which involves a sophisticated camera, projector system, and custom software, was developed by a team of art historians, conservation experts, and scientists at the Harvard Art Museums and the MIT Media Lab.
Inferring color from 1964 color transparencies of the works, as well as from unfaded sections of a sixth mural created by Rothko for the Harvard commission, the restoration team constructed “compensation images,” which, when projected onto the faded works, presents them as they may have looked in the 1960s.
Thomas W. Lentz, director of the Harvard Art Museums, said in the press release that the innovative conservation technique highlights the Art Museums’ objective: to promote art scholarship, innovation, and debate surrounding new restoration techniques.
“We think it is especially fitting that we celebrate the opening of our new home with a provocative exhibition that reinforces our core mission,” he said.
The Art Museums’ new facility, located at 32 Quincy St., will house works from across the University’s three art museums—the Arthur M. Sackler, the Busch-Reisinger, and the Fogg. Outfitted with 43,000 square feet of gallery space, the building also features six levels of public space and new spaces and resources for teaching and learning, including a 300-seat lecture hall, seminar rooms, and a media lab.
The exhibition will be on display from November 16 through July 2015 in the Harvard Art Museums’ special exhibitions gallery located at its new facility.

After months of uncertainty about its future, the Dunkin’ Donuts at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Bow Street will finally move to a new location this summer.
The store, whose facade made an appearance in the 1997 film “Good Will Hunting,” will make the move from its current location at 1 Bow St. to its new location at 1001 Mass. Ave. in early June.
Franchise owner David G. Carvalho said that the Bow St. location will officially close on June 2, and the new location will open June 4.
The future of the coffee shop was uncertain for several months as it dealt first with possible closure, a reversal of those plans, and finally the decision to relocate after obtaining a short-term lease until a new tenant could take its place.
Carvalho assures that after the move, there will will be no new developments on the horizon.
“There are no foreseeable factors that could cause any delays at this time,” Carvalho wrote. “The Bow St. Dunkin’ Donuts will be relocating because an opportunity arose to open a brand-new restaurant with updated features for both new and existing customers just a couple blocks away from the original storefront.”
Among the new improvements Carvalho mentioned were soft seating, digital menu boards, a television, outside seating, and an updated and contemporary look and feel.
Although the proprietors have several improvements planned, they will have to forgo one feature of the current location. Unlike the Bow St. location, the new establishment will not have a Baskin Robbins.
Signs have been placed on the doors of the establishment notifying visitors of the change. Included on the sign are the locations of other Harvard Square Dunkin Donuts franchises, including in the Harvard Square MBTA Station and at 65 JFK Street.
Customers who were in the Bow St. establishment early this week were surprised by the news of the change.
Frequent patron Nicole McDonald bemoaned the change, saying that the new location, although still a Dunkin’ Donuts, would not have the same atmosphere.
McDonald noted that while the new store will be only a few blocks from Harvard Square at 1001 Mass. Ave., she will probably start patronizing another one closer to her.
Carvalho said that all the workers from the Bow St. location will be transferred to the new branch. He declined to comment on what would replace Dunkin’ Donuts at its former Bow St. location. The Baskin Robbins that occupies the space with Dunkin’ Donuts is also expected to move out.

UPDATED: May 28, 2014, at 11:13 a.m.
Nearly two months after Allston residents first met to discuss an extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike that would include a rail station, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation announced at a meeting of the I-90 Allston Interchange Task Force last week that it would postpone any action on the potential station.
Citing budgetary concerns, MassDOT spokesperson Mike Verseckes told The Boston Globe on Tuesday that the proposed rail station, “West Station,” has been delayed, but not cancelled entirely. The station would connect Allston to downtown Boston and Cambridge.
“Long term, the MassDOT Capital Investment Plan does envision a station in this area in the future,” Verseckes said. “However, at this time, there is no funding specifically designated for construction.”
The proposed designs for the extension of the turnpike still include the train station and the results of last Wednesday’s meeting do not preclude future rail development, according to Galen M. Mook, an Allston resident and member of the task force.
Many Allston residents expressed disappointment over the delay of the construction of West Station, which they believe will benefit the community and the environment.
“If West Station is built, [Boston University] will benefit tremendously from it, Harvard will benefit from it, the entire region will benefit from it, and the environment will benefit,” Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said.
The proposed project would follow the guidelines put forth by GreenDOT, a sustainability initiative by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. Allstonians cited the environmental benefits of the station, which would allow residents to take public transportation rather than drive cars. Residents have also rallied around the proposed creation of the “People’s Pike,” a recreational path for cyclists, joggers, and walkers connecting the Allston with Harvard and the Charles River.
“I think the hope and expectation is that this project will mean much more for people using those green forms of transportation than those people sitting in their cars,” Mattison said of the Mass. Pike realignment project.
“Like other neighbors I am disappointed to hear the news, and I am hoping that something can be worked out,” said Allston resident Paola M. Ferrer.
Still, some Allston residents said they were not surprised by the scrapping of the rail station plans, given that funding had not been accounted for.
 
“It’s a little disappointing, but not surprising,” said Allston resident Richard Parr ’01, who said he suspected that the Department of Transportation was seeking funding for the project from Harvard.
Others said they are hopeful that Harvard will foot the bill for the station as well, including Mook.
“Ideally Harvard would fund this one,” Mook said, adding that the project would not only benefit the community but also offer the University further infrastructure for the Allston campus.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comments on the proposal directly.
“We don’t wish to speculate,” O’Rourke wrote in an email. “We will continue to participate in MassDOT’s Task Force process, which has only recently begun.”
Public-private partnerships to fund rail stations in the Boston Area are not unheard of. New Balance funded the construction of a passenger rail station near its corporate headquarters in Brighton.

Paul J. Finnegan ’75, a co-chair of the Harvard Campaign and a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing board, will replace Corporation colleague James F. Rothenberg ’68 as Harvard’s treasurer on July 1, the University announced Wednesday.
The treasurer oversees University-wide financial matters and serves both on the Corporation and, in ex-officio capacity, on the Board of Overseers. No other changes to the University’s financial administration, which is led by Chief Financial Officer Dan Shore, were announced Wednesday.
The treasurer has, in recent terms, served on the board of directors of Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s $32.7 billion endowment. Finnegan joined HMC’s board this spring, and Rothenberg will continue to serve as its chair.
“This is a moment of tremendous possibility for Harvard, and I’m honored to have this further chance to serve this institution,” Finnegan, who previously served as an overseer from 2008-2012, said in the release. “Like many of my fellow alumni, I feel a debt of gratitude for my experiences here as a student, and I hope my service as treasurer can help create for others the sense of opportunity that Harvard created for me.”
Finnegan, who is the co-CEO of the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners, is one of the leading players in Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, which seeks to raise what would be a record for fundraising in higher education, $6.5 billion. In addition to his work on the Corporation, Finnegan co-chairs the University-wide campaign as well as the campaign for the Graduate School of Education. He is also a vice chair of the the Business School’s campaign.
Rothenberg, who has served as treasurer since 2004 and has worked in various leadership roles at Harvard, said he looked forward to “wearing a slightly different hat” on the Corporation. Like Finnegan, he serves as a co-chair of the University-wide fundraising effort and is a member of the Committee on University Resources, an elite group of University donors.
“Paul Finnegan is an outstanding professional and a terrific person, someone who’s completely devoted to Harvard, and I know he will serve with distinction as treasurer,” Rothenberg said.
 
In the release, Faust credited the service of both Finnegan and Rothenberg.
“Both have played vital parts in Harvard’s governance in recent years, through a period of exceptional change, and we are fortunate to have them carrying forward on the Corporation in these essential roles,” she said.
The shift comes during a major week for the University, which celebrates its Commencement Exercises on Thursday and then transitions into a weekend of reunions, critical events for class engagement and, by extension, fundraising.

Students applying to Harvard College will no longer be required to submit two SAT subject tests, the Admissions and Financial Aid Office announced last week.
The Admissions Office chose to make the change because the cost of taking SAT subject tests may discourage low-income students from applying, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 wrote in a statement.
 
“While two SAT Subject Tests are normally required, the Admissions Office recently decided to permit applicants to apply without them, particularly if the cost of the tests represents a financial hardship,” Fitzsimmons wrote.
The change is part of ongoing efforts to attract applicants from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds.
The Admissions Office has yet to offer further details, but on its online site, it indicates that applicants may choose to leave subject tests out of their application even if they do not face financial burdens.
“You may apply without [subject tests] if the cost of taking the tests represents a financial hardship or if you prefer to have your application considered without them,” the site reads.
Fitzsimmons reiterated that candidates will continue to be judged on the same holistic process that the Admissions Office has used for years.
“As it has for decades, standardized testing continues to be only one component of our holistic admissions process and every application will be evaluated on the basis of all submitted information,” Fitzsimmons wrote.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha J. Power encouraged the 565 students graduating from the the Kennedy School of Government this week to spread the ideals of democracy across the globe during her speech at the school’s commencement exercises on Wednesday.
“Go out there graduates, and use the tools you now have to fix these problems,” Power said. “Help make democracy work better here and abroad.”
Wearing a winter coat due to the 50-degree weather, she discussed the challenges facing democracy today, citing examples from Ukraine, Venezuela, and the Arab Spring.
“Your challenge is to ensure that democracy expands, deepens, and delivers,” Power told graduates. “It’s our own relentless inch-by-inch effort to ‘form a more perfect Union’ that allows us to stand credibly and passionately for democracy and human rights abroad.”
Power said that throughout history, democratic institutions have allowed citizens to take agency in bettering their lives.
“True democracy, complete with checks and balances, offers what no other system can,” said Power, whose speech elicited a standing ovation from the crowd of graduates and their families. “If you give people the tools to correct the parts of their government that are broken, as only democracy can…they will seize them.”
Power, a Pulitzer Prize-winner, is a familiar face at Harvard. After graduating from the Law School in 1999, she served as a professor and founding executive director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Kennedy School. Power gave the Law School’s Class Day address in 2010 and is married to University professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75, whom she met while working on President Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
Power assumed the post of U.S. Ambassador to the UN in August 2013, where she “works to advance U.S. interests, promote and defend universal values, and address pressing global challenges to global peace, security, and prosperity,” according to the State Department’s website.
During his introductory remarks, Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 praised Power’s “remarkable career,” calling her “a true scholar” and “an extraordinary public servant.”
Students graduating from the Kennedy School will receive their diplomas on Thursday at John F. Kennedy Park after the conclusion of the morning exercises in the Yard.
Recent Kennedy School commencement speakers include Geoffrey Canada, president and CEO of the social service organization Harlem Children’s Zone, Christine M. O. Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and University professor Paul E. Farmer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Addressing this year’s 900 MBA recipients, their families, and friends, online-education tycoon Salman Khan spoke of graduates’ leadership potential at the Business School’s Class Day ceremonies on Wednesday.
Khan, who graduated from the Business School in 2003, founded the online-learning platform Khan Academy after tutoring his 12-year-old cousin over the telephone in 2004. He has since produced nearly 5,000 videos, largely focused on topics in mathematics and science, which reach an audience of more than 10 million users worldwide each month.
Recalling the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which occurred during his first few weeks as an MBA student, Khan spoke of the strong community he found at the Business School.
“Looking...at my new classmates helped me appreciate that the world was going to be okay,” Khan said. “They represented nearly every culture and community on the planet Earth, and they often disagreed, but they communicated.”
Going on to call the present an “inflection point” in the progress of civilization—due to rapid technological development—Khan urged members of the graduating class to embrace their positions as leaders in an array of fields in order to empower positive change across the globe.
“What type of reality humanity ends up in isn’t a flip of a coin. It isn’t random,” he said. “It will be dependent on the decisions you make. It will be dependent on the opportunities you take. It will be dependent on the cultures that you become a part of and how you choose to lead them. It will be dependent on the great leaps forward that are the products of your current daydreams.”
Casey D. Gerald, a 2014 graduate of the Business School and co-founder and CEO of MBAs Across America, a non-profit working to revitalize entrepreneurship and prosperity in the U.S., delivered the ceremonies’ student remarks.
“And as we leave this place for the final time,” Gerald said, “I hope that we have learned compassion, and trust, and sacrifice if nothing else. I hope that we have realized the purpose of life and renewed our belief in the possibility of life. I hope that we have taken a few chances, shed a few tears, and changed a few of our opinions.”
Also recognized in the ceremonies were four faculty members—professor Catherine S.M. Duggan, professor J. Gunnar Trumbull, professor Nori Gerardo Lietz, and professor David A. Moss—elected as exemplary mentors by the graduating class.

The Harvard College Class of 2014 gathered at Wednesday’s Class Day Exercises in Tercentenary Theater to listen as Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 called upon them to be open to criticism and “see the truth and speak the truth” about discrimination in society today.
In her address, Sandberg—COO of Facebook, former vice president for global online sales and operations for Google, and most recently, author of the acclaimed book, “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead”—drew upon her time as a student at the College and her experiences as a woman in a male-dominated workplace.
“The world was not equal then, and it is not equal now,” Sandberg said about the state of gender equality during her time as an undergraduate and in contemporary society.
She recalled being invited to speak at an all-male club in California and declining the offer on the grounds that she would not speak in front of any group that would not have her as a member. After she encouraged the club to reconsider their males-only policy, she remembered, club members had replied that these policies would change “eventually.”
“Our expectations are too low. Eventually needs to become immediately,” Sandberg said, drawing applause from the crowd.
Despite the overcast weather, many College seniors, along with their friends and relatives, packed into Tercentenary Theater for the ceremony, which kicked off with remarks from the first Class Marshal, Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14. Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister took the podium after Zhu.
Reflecting on his short tenure as dean of the College, Pfister welcomed the seniors into his “extended classroom,” detailing the history of the trees that once thrived in the Yard and how, like the Yard itself, seniors too had changed over their four years at Harvard.
Quoting J. R. R. Tolkien’s poem “All that is Gold Does Not Glitter,” Pfister asked students to “find  the gold that does not glitter” and wander but “always come home” in their post-Harvard careers.
During the ceremony, two students, Majahonkhe M. Shabangu ’14 and Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 were awarded Richard Glover and Henry Russell Ames Memorial prizes for their excellence in leadership and character.
Senior gift committee co-chair Arleen Y.Q. Chien ’14 announced that 78 percent of graduating seniors participated in Senior Gift, the fifth highest percentage in the College’s history.
In addition to Sandberg and Pfister, four undergraduates also spoke during the exercises, reflecting on success at Harvard and how they might take their experiences and transmit them into the future.
Adam J. Conner ’14, a former Crimson business editor, shared personal and humorous anecdotes about how his ultimately unfulfilled aspirations to join social organizations, maintain a high GPA, and score a prestigious job out of college may appear to be obvious failures but do not necessarily indicate that he had “failed Harvard.”
He cautioned the assembled crowd of the dangers of dwelling on their failures, and instead implored them to “start focusing on success.”
Christy L. DiSilvestro ’14, who said she had been on the varsity water polo team prior to injuring herself and ending up with crutches for two years, discussed the ways in which some of the most important memories of her undergraduate years could not be captured in a photograph.
“Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things,” DiSilvestro said.
Afterwards, Jenna D. Martin ’14, the female speaker of the Ivy orations program, which is intended for humorous reflection, poked fun at the banality of graduations and attempted to allay fears that the graduates peaked during college.
“Class of 2014, I am not saying you can do anything. As you will discover tomorrow, you can’t look good in a cap and gown. But at least there’s a good chance you didn’t peak in college,” Martin said.
Zachary W. Guzman ’14, the male speaker for the Ivy orations, took a similar lighthearted approach, making jokes about a satanic black mass which was originally scheduled to take place at Harvard earlier this month, the email search scandal, and affirmative action.
In the end, Guzman used an extended metaphor of Harvard as a romantic partner more than 350 years older than himself to confirm his love with the institution, which he said will last “till death do us part.”

Laughter filled Holmes Field outside Langdell Hall as comedian Mindy Kaling and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara ’90 addressed Law School graduates at the school’s annual Class Day ceremonies on Wednesday afternoon. Law School Dean Martha L. Minow also presented awards to students for community service work, pro bono legal services, and leadership.
Bharara drew laughs from crowd after calling Kaling and himself “two Indian-Americans for the price of one” and noting that he ended Tuesday evening by “sipping a scorpion bowl at the Kong,” referring to the Hong Kong restaurant in Harvard Square.
As U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Bharara has made a career of prosecuting white collar crime on Wall Street and, most notably, prosecuting attempted Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad.
“I hope you’ve gotten to know your Business School colleagues, because they are your future clients,” Bharara said, after joking about handing out subpoenas earlier in the day to students at the Business School.
Yet Bharara also conveyed a serious message to graduates, using a baseball analogy to call on them to focus on “being good before trying to be great.”
“There is a tendency for people like you, who are so successful and so accomplished and so credentialed, to think that every endeavor is like a baseball game where you’re going to go out and pitch a perfect game, but that’s not the case,” he said, urging graduates to take life on “one pitch at a time.”
Kaling, most famous for her role in the hit television sitcom, “The Office,” called herself “just a pretty Hollywood starlet.”
“To be honest, I don’t know much about the law…. I have no idea why I’m here today,” she said.
Kaling drew laughs after describing Dartmouth College, her alma mater, as a place “where, when you arrive, you’re given moonshine and a box of fireworks and told to quote, ‘go to town.’”
After trying to interpret the Law School’s crest and teasingly lauding graduates for taking on the “noblest of pursuits” like defending “British Petroleum against birds,” Kaling earnestly asked students to continue to create the kind of fairness that she said allowed her and her family to immigrate to and succeed in the United States.
“[In the U.S.], you can aspire and succeed,” she said. “That fairness...is, in part, resting on your shoulders to uphold.”
Graduating students and their family members said they enjoyed the speakers, despite the dreary weather.
“I think both speakers were pretty amazing,” Jamie A. Niskanen-Singer said. “They definitely exceeded already high expectations—Mindy Kaling was particularly funny.”
With weather forecasts looking more promising for tomorrow’s Commencement exercises, families said that they are optimistic about the festivities to come.
“I’m excited for [Commencement],” Travis D. Miscia, as he stood next to his father. “And the weather is supposed to be better.” 
 
Commencement ceremonies for those graduating from the Law School, as well as from other schools at Harvard, will be held at Tercentenary Theater on Thursday morning.

In a demonstration of support for the Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign and other student activist efforts, a number of College seniors will don red tape atop their traditional black graduation caps when they walk into the Yard for Commencement ceremonies Thursday.
According to organizers, although the demonstration will focus on signaling support for Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student campaign that advocates for changes to Harvard’s sexual assault policy, it will also back the work of a number of other student activist groups on campus.
Lily H. Ostrer ’14, one of several students who organized the demonstration, said that students from several groups—including The Diversity Report, the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign, and Divest Harvard—have come together for the effort.
“Students from across the College who have been involved in different campaigns, different issues, different forms of activism decided that...now was a really special opportunity to continue expressing the student voice and demonstrate to Harvard that the student voice is important, and that we are willing to stand up for the issues that we believe [in] and hold the University accountable,” Ostrer said Wednesday.
Participating students will place a single stripe of red tape along the right side of their graduation caps, according to organizers Isabel R. Ostrer ’14 and Jessica R. Fournier ’17. Lily Ostrer said that organizers are unsure of how many graduating seniors will participate in the demonstration, but added that they hope for between 100 and 200 participants.
This show of solidarity comes after a semester marked by an increased scrutiny into Harvard’s sexual assault policy and practices.
Roughly two months ago, a first-person, anonymous op-ed published in The Crimson reignited debate on campus about issues surrounding sexual assault. In late March, undergraduates filed a complaint with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights alleging that the College’s sexual assault policies violate federal Title IX regulations. OCR later accepted the complaint and launched an investigation into the issue.
Amidst this debate, University President Drew G. Faust announced that Harvard had submitted its revised sexual assault policy to OCR for review. She also convened a University-wide task force to address issues of sexual assault at Harvard.
This academic year has also been marked by series of other protests by student activists on campus. After Harvard announced that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, would speak at Commencement this spring, a number of students criticized the choice and Bloomberg’s support for the city’s stop-and-frisk policy. Critics of the choice argued that the policy, which allows police to randomly stop, question, and search pedestrians for illegal materials, is discriminatory.
The announcement that Bloomberg would speak at Commencement came on the heels of a wider debate regarding race relations and inclusion at Harvard. “I, Too, Am Harvard,” a social media campaign about race at Harvard and a theatrical production of the same name, attracted international attention.
Following the production, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister and incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana convened a working group, to be chaired by Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, to discuss issues of inclusion at the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s basketball team defeated New Mexico in the second round of the 2013 NCAA Tournament, it was hailed as a Cinderella story.
But even the basketball squad’s underdog journey pales in comparison to that of junior Denis Nguyen of the men’s tennis team. The Anaheim, Calif., native just completed an improbable run by reaching the national semifinals of the NCAA Men’s Singles Championship.
"I had no idea I was ever going to make it that far,” Nguyen said. “I was so happy to finish so deep in the tournament. I thought winning a round would be nice. Winning two was huge because it secured All-American [status], and after that it was just a blur."
But while Nguyen may not have anticipated his run, Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 has seen Nguyen’s substantial promise and was unsurprised by his success.
"We saw this kind of potential from the beginning with Denis,” Fish said. “Over the last year…he’s played at this level in parts of matches. There have been two things [holding him back]: his mind hadn’t yet caught up with what his body was able to do, and his understanding of the level of conditioning necessary to play his game to the fullest extent."
While the rest of his Harvard classmates are enjoying the start of their summer vacation, Nguyen, who is ranked 39th nationally and earned an at-large bid into the bracket, traveled to Athens, Ga., to compete in the tournament, which was held May 21-26.
Nguyen went 11-4 in dual play for the season at the No. 1 slot for a Crimson squad that placed second in the Ivy League and advanced to the Round of 32 at the NCAA Tournament in early May. He also earned All-Ivy League singles honors for the third straight year, including a unanimous first-team selection for the second consecutive season.
The junior backed up those accolades at the national tournament, coming out strong in his first round matchup against No. 40 Lloyd Glasspool of Texas.
Nguyen took an early three-game lead and eventually broke Glasspool’s serve on set point to take the first set, 6-4. In the second frame, Nguyen again jumped out ahead, and closed out the Longhorn junior, 6-3.
From there, Nguyen took on 44th-ranked Fred Saba of Duke in the second round. Harvard’s top singles player again started quickly, breaking the Blue Devil senior’s serve and jumping out to a 4-0 lead. Nguyen eventually took the set, 6-4, and won the second set by the same score to close out the match.
With the win over Saba, Nguyen advanced to the Round of 16 and officially clinched All-America status, becoming the Crimson’s first singles All-American since Jonathan Chu ’05. Chu also eventually advanced to the semifinals of the 2005 tournament.
"Being an All-American is one of the most prestigious awards a college athlete can really get,” Nguyen said. “It was always something that was there—a distant goal, a benchmark. I thought I could make it if I trained really hard, but didn’t think of it as something tangible I could attain."
Nguyen entered his Round of 16 matchup against South Carolina’s Andrew Adams a day after playing both his match against Saba and his doubles contest with co-captain Casey MacMaster in the doubles bracket, where Nguyen and MacMaster fell in a third set tiebreak.
But fatigue was clearly not an issue for Nguyen, as he again started fast, breaking Adams and taking a 6-4 victory in the first set. Nguyen was even better in the second, playing a near-perfect frame to win, 6-4, 6-1.
The triumph set up a quarterfinal battle with Florida senior Florent Diep, who led the Gators with 31 singles wins on the year. But Nguyen made quick work of Diep, finishing off a 6-2, 6-2 victory with an ace to advance to the final four.
Nguyen’s opponent was Pepperdine senior Alex Sarkissian, ranked 28th in the country. Nguyen started off strong as usual, with a 6-4 win in the first set, but dropped the second set, 7-5—his first lost set of the entire tournament. Sarkissian prevailed, 6-2, in the third to end Nguyen’s run.
Nguyen’s advancing to the national semifinals stands as the longest run for a Harvard player since James Blake reached the championship match in 1999.
Fish views Nguyen’s strong play on a national stage as an indicator of the strength of the Crimson program.
“We take it as an endorsement of what all the kids in the program have done,” Fish said. “By having a strong commitment to doing the hard work, Denis was able to put himself in a position to do something with his preparation. But if you don’t have good teammates, you can’t get that good yourself.”
Thanks to that preparation, it is all coming together for Nguyen—now an All-American, and a recently elected team co-captain and team Most Valuable Player.
“Throughout my Harvard career, I think I’ve improved each year, and in different parts of the game,” Nguyen said. “Balancing athletics with academics has enhanced my mental capacity to do well. Mentally, I was strong enough to go through the tournament, and this week has been a culmination of my work.”

I remember the day and morning before my standardized test. I was almost in tears because of the Math section I feared so much. But perhaps others also taking the test had less to be worried about: such is the persuasive case presented in the new book “Sneak Attack” by Peter Wayner.
Technology is always a cat-and-mouse game between those with malice in mind, who use technological knowledge to aide their wrongdoing, and those who wish to maintain equity and use these advancements for good. Unbeknownst to many of us college students, College Board test takers have used technology to jump leagues ahead on our most important college preparation test by cheating.
“Sneak Attack” enters the world of these high school geeks. Taking a conversation with a Brooklyn Science grad, as well as many other technical sources, Wayner exposes the simple fact that “anyone could cheat on the SAT” by highlighting tactics that any savvy high schooler may employ:
1. Reprogram certain calculators to include mathematical functions way beyond the four-function rules, without being caught
2. Program in SAT vocabulary lists and take them into the test
3. Purchase SAT Software packs from private companies that allow test-takers to work faster through the test
4. Watch YouTube videos from other tech-experts that highlight new ways students can use their calculators to assist them in the test
Worse? It seems that the College Board is at the heart of the trouble. They appear to be unaware that such cheating is occurring. Inattentive, poorly paid proctors, the nature of the SAT math, and deeply unresponsive calculator and cheating policies are highlighted as evidence of their ignorance. The College Board’s performance on cheating is demonstrated to be falling way behind the ACT, GMAT and other standardized testing practices.
It cannot be pure stupidity. The College Board in the year 2010-2011 earned roughly $720 million income. One would think that such a pervasive organization would have ample resources to stop the gaming of their own test, maybe not through technical knowledge, but at least through rules that blocks such systematic methods of cheating. Unwilling blindness must certainly be the cause: it is not just the economic inertia of a hugely wealthy organization, but a closed governance has led it to become inactive and out-of-touch with the realities of the testing room.
Is anyone really able to cheat on the test? Of course not. Such cheating is academically and socio-economically specific. The terrifying thing about this self-selecting group of tech nerds is their dedication to fooling the test, but not exactly their numbers. Even most of the public schools noted in the book, such as Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, are extremely competitive and technogically-focused institutions. Ironically, such cheating will be most commonly done by those who need to worry the least about the exam: the richer, smarter and technically connected individuals.
In response to these cheating tactics, the College Board is eliminating the use of the calculator from one third of the test. Wayner suggests the future industry standard should be to have test-provided calculators handed out at the start of the exam, which prevent the use of external computation. David Mainiero, the Director of College Counseling at InGenius Prep, thinks that this proposal “would certainly help to level the playing field” for test-takers, and especially benefit those who could not or would not have otherwise brought a calculator on their test day.”
Truth be told, such cheating may be relatively insignificant as a proportion of the test-taking population and it will doubtlessly rarely change an SAT performance. Instead, Sneak Attack alerts us to a cheating culture which could only get worse. Mainiero explained that this cheating culture is a particularly pervasive problem when it comes to international applications. He said that admissions officers could routinely throw out thousands of applications from abroad because they were clearly inauthentic in some way. Unlike those application defects though, the problem with the SAT cheating that Wayner is describing is that it is virtually undetectable once it’s been perpetrated.
Given the recent and likely continued drop in college admissions rates, especially to highly selective colleges, and given the already huge academic and socio-economic disadvantages some applicants face, such SAT cheating is another piece of admissions ‘in-knowledge’ that is reserved for the lucky few. Sneak Attack presents us with both an interesting problem with the SAT as well as some thoughtful solutions.
