After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Boston-area residents, the subway system is more than just a convenient tool for travel. It is a staple of an urban lifestyle that also has a low impact on the environment.  Massachusetts historically led the way for the United States in terms of going green, as exemplified by the recent passing of the Global Warming Solutions Act. 
However, all of the positive legislation and momentum will be pushed backward if several proposed changes to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority take place. Last week, officials of the MBTA released budgeting information that included major cuts to its subway services, including ending weekday commuter rail service after 7 p.m., removing customer service personnel from all stations, and cutting enough overall service from its bus lines and rail systems to generate a loss of over 40 million riders annually.
These massive cutbacks hurt students, commuters, and tourists due to spotty availability but will not decrease the number of people that need to get around the Boston area. Without the reliable system most are used to, increased use of cars will lead to further congestion, accidents, and pollution.
Boston has always been one of the pioneers of public transportation, including being the first American city to implement an underground subway system, and, at a time when easing the burden we put on the environment is a major priority, it is an inopportune moment to cut back on service. Many major cities today still lack robust public transportation, and to benefit its citizens and lower energy usage we need to increase, rather than curtail, mass-transit programs. It is understandable that in these tough economic times money has to come from somewhere, but alternative sources do exist. A legislative proposal that is still pending approval by the Massachusetts State Legislature calls for increasing the tax on gasoline sold in the state, a measure that could eliminate the MBTA’s budget deficit. Beyond solving the fiscal problems of the commonwealth, the proposed gas tax also promises to keep more cars off the road. 
Massachusetts may be running out of options to solve its budget crisis, but pulling back on the T is no place to turn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was almost too predictable to be taken seriously. “No work during the holidays!” cried the Harvard students upon discovery that the administration had abandoned planned courses for the new January break. “But whatever shall we do?”
An evaluation of the typical Ivy League personality reveals this anxiety to be understandable. There are various routes into Harvard—trillions of dollars in family money, the skills of an unsurpassed prodigy, or a willingness to expose oneself the harshest of nature’s elements, peeling the skin off of one’s own palms and repeatedly pushing a plank through water (otherwise known as crew). Most of us, however, choose to work very, very hard. While generally regarded as a positive characteristic, this drive to work also makes us susceptible to tendencies of excess. As a necessary counter to the detrimental effects of an obsessive work ethic, we should welcome the enforced break of an unstructured J-term. 
In many cases, work fanaticism is either an avoidance or cultivation of inadequacies in other, less structured, domains. Although students’ original dedication to work was likely based on an innate love of algebra, it is possible that this interest was also motivated by a somewhat diminished temptation for the frolics of youth. A highly scientific straw poll of the first 20 people I recognized in Quincy revealed that only four felt they were popular at the age of 12 to 14; past social reclusion is not a universalistic trend, but it does seem to be prevalent. 
As awkward 12-year-olds with thick glasses and asthma, perhaps many of us came to the decision that, if our judgmental tweenage peers wouldn’t accept us, we would find entertainment elsewhere. Distancing ourselves from sleepovers, playground antics, and inconsistent cliques, we turned to books, perhaps even requesting extra work from teachers to fill the empty void of lunch break.
Reward arrived with our Harvard acceptance letters, and salvation was granted in the opportunity to join a campus of fellow one-time social outcasts. But, if the palpability of students’ social abilities is less obvious, the unrelenting drive to work persists and automatically demands limited social interactions.
The problem? Well, for one thing, Harvard students are unhappy. Student satisfaction ranks near the bottom of a group of elite colleges, and a lack of social life is identified as one of the major problems. A close friend—atypical at Harvard in that she has always been popular and is thus possibly more affected by the lack of social interactions—recently told me that she viewed her university experience as a reason to “be strong and just get through time.”
Indeed, in many cases, the desperate effort to add on more courses and yet more extracurricular activities does seem like a frantic attempt to fill time. Students cram the day with meetings and work so that there is not the slightest opportunity for conversation. Summer vacation? Internship. Winter vacation? Fall back on the middle-school tactic and ask for extra work, formally known as the J-term.
Our excessive dependence on work is revealed by the worried speculation over how to fill time now that J-term courses are cancelled. Relying on university administration to provide fulfilling experiences suggests a feeble lack of self-sufficiency. Similarly, demands for holiday courses, even if optional and not for credit, hints at an aversion to independent thought. Even if one specifically selects a topic of personal interest, J-term courses would still feed students potential topics to consider and contentions to analyse. Why can’t students use holiday relaxation to come up with their own questions? 
Collectively, Harvard students are extremely successful in a work environment but have a dire need to develop the other aspects of a well-rounded life. Personally motivated pursuits—long conversations with friends, reading for pleasure, thought driven by curiosity and not course demands—are crucial aspects of life notably underemphasized on the Harvard campus. Given students’ unhappiness with their highly work-oriented lives, it seems obvious that much can be gained from the imposed abandonment of work for five weeks next January. Hopefully, this will give students the space to reconsider their middle-school habits and dabble in the other forums of life.

If you want to know how to defeat the American military, you should ask the Pentagon. On April 6, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced a massive restructuring of the United States’ military spending plans for the foreseeable future. Essentially, it cancels or scraps many of the most advanced technological development projects now being undertaken by American industry. 
Under the aegis of reducing “wasteful spending” and favoring weapons for Iraq and Afghanistan over so-called “Cold War” systems, the administration will cancel further procurement of the world’s best fighter aircraft, end production of its most versatile cargo plane, do away with the flagship military communications satellite program for the next decade, scrap several major missile-defense projects and a search and rescue helicopter project, and significantly delay or cancel many U.S. Navy shipbuilding programs.
On the surface, choosing not to build “Cold War” systems and reducing “waste” sounds fine. In reality, both of these actions are flawed. This smorgasbord of cuts goes too far and has the potential to threaten the long-term dominance of American industry, military power, and technology.
Gates has made a name for himself criticizing what he calls “next-war-itis”; the military mindset of preparing for these kinds of massive conflicts with peers like China and losing focus on the current wars. It is true that the military has adopted too much of this mindset in recent years. But these cuts damage our technological hedge against potential “peer” enemies by judging that, because our current wars have no technological enemies, our future wars won’t either. While unlikely, a peer war is not impossible, and the dangers of being caught unprepared in such a conflict are far too great to ignore. To risk victory in such a war by cancelling our most advanced weapons projects simply because there is currently a recession is both foolhardy and arrogant.
This attitude is also inconsistent with President Obama’s pronounced goals in domestic policy. The idea of withdrawing funds that support the most cutting-edge research by the nation’s best and brightest in a field in which the U.S. has perhaps the largest lead over any other in the world—advanced technological development—is questionable at best. It goes directly against the ideals he has promoted domestically of stimulating our economy, supporting science and technology, and providing opportunities for young engineers and scientists to engage in the most exciting and advanced work possible, and it is certainly not welcome news to the American high-tech industry, already reeling from the recession and the loss of civilian business. 
It is true that some of these so-called “Cold War” systems were originally designed to be used against adversaries who were roughly equivalent to the U.S. in military ability. But most of the systems are still enormously valuable in current conflicts. The search-and-rescue helicopter and communications satellite programs are clearly useful even in peacetime; missile defense as it now exists is a system that is only effective against erratic, small actors such as North Korea, which just launched another missile; and cargo planes are desperately needed to support the wars and humanitarian efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, as another illustration of the inconsistency of these cuts with Obama’s policies, the C-17, a cargo plane now being cancelled, is specifically cited by Obama on his administration website as an example of a post-Cold War aircraft that is well suited for fighting the wars on terrorism.
Questioning what constitutes “waste” in military procurement is difficult. Much like with the domestic stimulus, at some level it is possible to point to nearly any unwanted spending and declare it to be waste. Looked at more dispassionately, what is referred to as “waste” simply boils down to a disagreement between the government and contractor on how the contract or requirements are interpreted. 
“Waste” is, in fact, most often generated by Congress. There are many ways in which this can occur, but one of the most common, which these cuts contain in spades, is that of wasting sunk research and development costs. For example, suppose $50 billion are spent over 10 years to develop the technology necessary to produce a new airplane. When the plane is finally ready to be built, a recession hits and Congress decides to cancel the plane after only 10 are built. Even though the marginal cost of each aircraft might be only $70 million, these planes are assigned the entire sunk cost and are now “$5 billion aircraft.” Critics then point to this aircraft as an example of wasted money and time and use it as a way to torpedo other programs before they can cause such awful “waste.” This is a matter of interpretation and shortsightedness by Congress.  
While oversight and careful attention to the necessity of weapons is laudable, these cuts are far too deep and have the potential to significantly set back the U.S. military and defense industry inasmuch as they mean that we will be relying on our current weapons for the foreseeable future. 
Hopefully, Harvard professor Ashton Carter, recently tapped by the president to head weapons procurement for the Pentagon, can inject some sanity into this process. The damage that this plan will do to industry, to engineers, and ultimately to the future dominance of the U.S. military is simply too dangerous to ignore.Daniel A.

Noted hip-hop poet Kevin Coval came to Quincy House yesterday, bringing his professional artistic pedigree to a student-organized open-mic and slam poetry event that aimed to spur creative discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Sponsored by the Progressive Jewish Alliance, the Society of Arab Students, and the Harvard Spoken Word Society, yesterday’s event marked an innovative attempt at using an artistic performance to address issues of faith and politics, according to Jason W. Schnier ’11, chair of the Progressive Jewish Alliance. “[The event] was conceptualized as a new way to engage with the Middle East conflict, and a different way to think about religious identity in a pluralistic community,” Schnier said.    “We bring in peace activists, and sometimes we approach it in a cut-and-dried fashion,” Schnier said. “This is a creative way to do that.” Mashael A. Fakhro ’11, the co-president of the Society of Arab Students, also emphasized the event’s creativity, writing in an e-mail, “SAS is co-sponsoring because it supports dialogue on the conflict through creative and innovative means.” Jose G. Olivarez ’10, a director of the Spoken Word Society, which helped sponsor last night’s event, had prior ties to Coval, who mentored Olivarez through the group Young Chicago Authors. Olivarez was the sole audience member to volunteer to share his poetry in the open-mic segment of the evening, reading his own poem, “Walls.” Coval then took the floor and performed several pieces on themes ranging from the Chicago sunrise to growing up as a Jewish-American in the Chicago suburbs. “I’m down for a difficult conversation,” Coval said during the event, “because that’s how democracy functions.”The artist closed with poems about Israel and Judaism, asking “Can you alone be chosen in an interconnected universe?” in one piece entitled “Hero Israel.”An open discussion about the Israel-Palestine conflict between Coval and audience members followed the performance.“So often, when you talk about the Israel-Palestine conflict, you get bogged down in two different, opposing views,” Olivarez said before yesterday’s event. “For me, the goal is really about sharing the variety of voices from Palestine and Israel.”

A former senator, a nonprofit founder, and a current Harvard graduate student—all of whom served in the U.S. military—discussed the meaning of leadership and public service in an intimate forum event last night at the Institute of Politics. The speakers included former Georgia Senator Max Cleland; Eric Greitens, who used his combat pay from Iraq and Afghanistan to start an organization that allows disabled veterans to serve their communities; and Maura C. Sullivan, a Harvard MBA/MPA candidate who served for seven months as a marine in Fallujah, Iraq. The conversation dealt with the speakers’ combat experiences as well as their desire to serve the nation in other ways. Cleland, who was severely wounded in Vietnam, said he decided to pursue his political aspirations because he was left with few options after the war. “When I decided to offer myself as a candidate for public office, I really had nowhere else to go,” he said. “No one was going to hire me, no one was giving me any work, so I decided to go ahead and try to fulfill my dreams.”Sullivan said she is entering the private sector after graduation, but that she hopes to return to government work in the future. She stressed the importance of maintaining a public service mindset even in the business world.  “If there is one thing that my classmates and I have been discussing here, it’s, ‘Oh my gosh, we really need ethical leadership in the private sector,’” she said. The speakers agreed that today’s youth is particularly enthusiastic about aiding the broader world. “I’m incredibly hopeful about what this generation can do in terms of public service,” Greitens said. After their discussion, the speakers responded to questions from the diverse audience, which included undergraduates, graduate students, and many Cambridge residents. One local doctor, who lived in Saigon during the Tet offensive, cried as he thanked Cleland for his service. After the event, Greitens said he was glad to have the opportunity to encourage students to pursue public service work. “I hope that what they will take from tonight is the belief that they have something to contribute,” he said. Christopher J. Hollyday ’11, chair of the IOP Forum Committee, said he thought the talk was extremely important given the modern economic climate.“I thought the event was really good, in that it addressed leadership and public service and making it happen in this time when people are shifting from traditional fields like finance to public service and government jobs,” he said. ­—Staff writer Evan T.

Sunspot activity may be a primary factor in climate fluctuations, according to Willie Soon, a researcher affiliated with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Harvard College Observatory, who offered the hypothesis in an interview with TG Daily, an online news source. Although many climatologists have cited increases in carbon dioxide as the primary cause of the temperature increases associated with global warming, Soon maintained that solar radiation from sunspots also has a great effect.“The sun is a great driving force to climate change,” Soon said in an interview with The Crimson yesterday, adding that most observed climate data could be explained by fluctuations in solar radiation.  Sunspots—pockets of magnetism on the sun’s surface—generate high levels of energy, which then heat the Earth’s atmosphere. Soon told TG Daily that the lack of additional energy resulting from a decrease in sunspots is directly responsible for colder temperatures experienced in recent years. He said that, as of last week, there had been sunspots on only 11 days this year, and there were only 99 days with visible sunspots last year—the second-lowest total since 1911.Brian F. Farrell, a Harvard meteorology professor, acknowledged a connection between sunspot activity and temperatures on the Earth, but cited other research showing that sunspots only account for an overall temperature change of a tenth of a degree centigrade.Farrell did acknowledge that there could have been larger temperature effects caused by sunspots in the past.  “A strong correlation between the amount of radioactive carbon and temperature from ice cores has shown that solar activity can affect temperature,” Farrell said.He cautioned that the link was “a hypothesis...[that] does not have firm scientific grounding.”But Soon said that there have been much greater temperature fluctuations due to sunspots in the past and that proponents of global warming need to consider the effects of sunspot activity on global temperatures.

With his administration on the brink of a sweeping fiscal review that could lead to layoffs, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith will host a town hall meeting today, discussing the state of the Faculty’s finances before an unprecedented group of stakeholders.In lieu of the regular Faculty meeting that had been scheduled for today, Smith will discuss the budgetary challenges facing the Faculty before opening the floor for questions from professors, staff, and selected student leaders gathered in Sanders Theatre, according to FAS spokesman Robert P. Mitchell.The town hall meeting comes one day after the conclusion of an early retirement incentive program offered to FAS staff workers—a milestone in the budgeting process that will provide information necessary to evaluate spending for next year. Staffers who accepted the package during the 45-day election period had until yesterday to revoke their decisions.In an interview February, Smith said the administration would use the results of the early retirement program to reevaluate the budget and determine whether staff layoffs will be necessary. The fewer staffers decide to take the package, the higher the possibility of layoffs will be, Smith said.According to a guidebook for FAS departments that details planning procedures for next year’s budget, the administration will know the number of retirees in each department by mid-April. Departments that may need to initiate job cuts after the program’s end have been instructed to devise provisional lists of workers who might be laid off, and top FAS deans would make any final decisions on layoffs no earlier than the end of this month.“I’m sure once [FAS administrators] know how many people take the early retirement offer, they’ll know how much it’s costing them and how much they’re saving,” said professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68. “But they couldn’t really make a plan until they knew that.”Faculty and staff said they hope the meeting will clarify a now hazy fiscal picture, especially in light of last month’s revelation that endowment funding for Harvard schools will fall 8 percent next year—a far steeper drop than expected. But some are more doubtful that Smith will unveil any groundbreaking initiatives at the meeting.“I don’t have a sense that there’s going to be any big announcement or startling changes in direction,” said Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. “If there was, I don’t think they’d do it this way.”In a departure from typical Faculty meetings, the town hall gathering will expand its attendance to staff and 22 student leaders of student groups like the Committee on Undergraduate Education, according to Undergraduate Council President Andrea R. Flores ’10.History department financial administrator Cory Paulsen, who has worked at Harvard for about two decades, said she has not ever witnessed the degree of transparency offered by the town hall meeting. She said she suspects that for most of the question-and-answer session, individuals will express their fears of impending layoffs.“It will be good for people who aren’t really in a position where they have to possibly lose an odd job or home, to hear the voice of someone who is actually facing that,” Paulsen said. “I think it’s going to be pretty intense.”—Staff writer Esther I.

University officials said yesterday that they have reversed preliminary budget guidance that would have prevented new programs from tapping a recently created source of additional endowment funding in the next fiscal year.The decision to continue allowing new initiatives to benefit from the strategic payout program—which grants high-priority projects across the University modest increases in endowment funding—came shortly after schools received notice that only programs already receiving the funding would be eligible to use strategic payout funds next year.Former University President Lawrence H. Summers originally conceived the program to up the payout rate from the endowment while avoiding a blanket funding increase that he said could encourage programs not in need of additional money to waste resources.“There are undoubtedly particular people with particular projects who are focused on their particular budget and want more money to be paid out,” Summers told The Crimson at the time. “But my sense is that the academic leadership of the schools shares the same view that the Corporation has—that we need to set payout in a way that maximizes what we are able to do on a sustainable basis.”The program was launched in fiscal year 2006, while endowment returns were high and payout was falling consistently short of Harvard’s 5 percent target, leading University leaders to seek new methods to increase spending from the endowment.But the recent decision to continue accepting new projects comes amidst a dramatic decline in the value of the endowment, which has pushed the projected payout rate for next year to over 6 percent—the highest the University has seen in over two decades. With payments already projected to overshoot the desired five-percent mark, additional strategic spending will only push spending farther from the target.University spokesman John D. Longbrake wrote in an e-mailed statement that the decision to maintain the strategic payout program was made “in recognition of the importance of making continuing progress in directing resources to shared University priorities.”Financial aid at the College, for example, has been a strategic priority in the past. And the amount spent on aid next year is expected to increase by 18 percent, as more families suffer the effects of a weak economy.The strategic payout has previously helped to support faculty expansion and renovation of student space at the Law School, as well as the Medical School’s fledgling Department of Systems Biology, which received seed funding over a five-year period as part of a University-wide effort to expand interdisciplinary initiatives, according to department head Marc Kirschner.—Staff writer Athena Y.

Last year, when the Harvard government department organized a meeting for alumni, current professors were asked to give a presentation on their projects and research. One participant was former professor and department chair Samuel H. Beer, who gave a short statement about the nuances of political science during his tenure at Harvard from 1946 to 1982.“He completely stole the show,” said government professor Stanley Hoffmann, a former student of Beer’s. “[The current professors] were all preempted by the master, who spoke without notes, remembering everyone and everything. No one believed the man was 96 years old at the time.”Beer, a noted scholar of British and American politics, passed away on April 7, at the age of 97. “He was a spectacularly good teacher because his classes were all in the form of questions he addressed to himself and his students, for which he had all sorts of arguments before coming to his own conclusion,” said Hoffman. “It was very different from the typical top-down sort of lecturing. It was as if he was struggling with his own opinions.”Beer, the chair of the Harvard government department from 1954 to 1958, served as the Eaton Professor of the Science of Government for years before moving to Boston College in 1982 to be a professor of American politics.Receiving his B.A. from the University of Michigan, Beer went to England on a Rhodes Scholarship before receiving his Ph.D. in political science from Harvard in 1943. He was later granted an honorary doctorate from the University in 1997 in recognition of “his scholarship and [the] enormous impact his teaching had on undergraduates for over three decades,” said Peter A. Hall, Beer’s former student, who is currently a European studies professor at Harvard.Beer was most famous for his self-designed course Social Studies 2: “Western Thought and Institutions,” which he taught for 30 years.  Students studied six key moments in the development of Western Civilization, and “used theoretical lenses to understand the historical process,” said former teaching fellow Judith E. Vichniac, the current director of the fellowship program at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.“Everywhere he went he was stopped on the streets by people who have taken that course,” Hall said. “It was one that inspired thousands of Harvard students.”The teaching fellows who worked with Beer often went on to careers as academics or public service officials. Some of his famous students included Henry A. Kissinger ’50, Michael Walzer, and Charles H. Tilly ’50. Before studying at Harvard, Beer was a staff member of the Democratic National Committee, and occasionally wrote speeches for former President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 and 1936. Active in American politics, Beer was chairman of Americans for Democratic Action during his tenure at Harvard from 1959 to 1962. He also actively opposed student rebellions at Harvard during the late sixties.Beer was elected president of the American Political Science Association in 1977, and was also appointed as a fellow of the British Academy in 2000.After earning his Ph.D., Beer earned a Bronze Star fighting with the U.S. Army in Normandy. During his time at Oxford in the 1930s, he travelled to Germany, where he saw Hitlerism first hand, according to Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, another of Beer’s former students. “He wanted to know how Germany could have fallen so far to embrace these vicious totalitarian ideas,” Mansfield said. “His courses were often directed to that subject.” Beer described the influence of these travels on his graduate work at Harvard in the Oxford Handbook of Political Institutions. “By the time I came to Harvard in the fall of 1938, I was a fierce anti-communist, a fervent New Dealer, a devotee of Emerson, and ready to try to put it all together….[in] a defense of liberalism against the totalitarian threat,” Beer wrote. Many of his former students praised Beer’s engaging personality and dedication to teaching.“He had a very good eye for the most important questions in politics and was intensely engaged with the thinkers over the ages who had worked with those questions,” Hall said. “When you talked to Sam Beer you were engaging in a dialogue with Marx, Weber, or Augustine. He had read an enormous amount, and he thought deeply about the big social and political questions throughout his life.”“He would come to class wearing his military outfit and pump his fist, and tell us what to think about,” Mansfield said.

A University of Texas professor condemned pornography as the depraved and even apocalyptic embodiment of society’s ills at last night’s kick-off event for the annual “Take Back the Night” movement created to support survivors of sexual violence.“Pornography is what the end of the world looks like,” said professor Robert W. Jensen, who blamed capitalism, white supremacy, and racism for the spread of increasingly violent heterosexual pornography.Jensen said that pornography becomes increasingly violent, racially charged, and degrading towards women to increase profit by appealing to capitalist consumers.The lecture—co-sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and several student groups—was billed as an effort to promote dialogue about sexual violence.With over 20 years of research on pornography to his name, Jensen—who focuses on male production and consumption of pornographic material—spoke candidly, frankly, and often humorously about the sensitive and potentially uncomfortable topic.  “Can all the men who masturbated to pornography in the last 48 hours please come down to the front,” Jensen joked at one point amid laughter. “How about in the last ten minutes?” a male student quipped in response.Jensen warned of potentially graphic descriptions in his lecture, but when he launched into the description of the top five most commonly produced “sexual acts,” many women and several men in the audience looked visibly shocked and disgusted. Four people left the lecture hall.Jensen said that his message was not the rant of a “radical apocalyptic crazy man from Texas,” but some students had reservations. “I don’t think I identified with many of Jensen’s points...I think some of his arguments were rather far fetched,” said Tarik Umar ’10, who nevertheless added that he found the lecture was “definitely interesting.”Others said Jensen’s message was positive. “I’m a new Christian, trying to live a pure life,” said Josue G. Ortiz-Santana ’11. “So I am trying to learn about why pornography is detrimental to both men and women.”Ortiz-Santana also said he invited his teammates on the football team to view the event with him. “I would like to open my teammates’ eyes to the struggles of women and why pornography is detrimental to those that view it,” he said, adding that none of his teammates were able to make the event. OSAPR Director Sarah Rankin said Jensen brought an unusual and interesting perspective to the table in the effort to increase dialogue about sexual violence.“It is interesting to hear a male talking about pornography from a feminist perspective, and to see the audience’s reaction,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League baseball schedule is somewhat of a paradox, both generously forgiving and callously cruel. 
A team with a woeful overall record can still be a contender as long as it excels against its conference foes, while a squad with a proven track record of success can easily be written off if it falters in Ancient Eight play.
For Harvard, the system has worked to its advantage. Or maybe the Crimson has worked the system. Either way, the team is 10-22 after sweeping Yale in yesterday’s doubleheader at O’Donnell Field, but is still very much alive in the Rolfe Division race thanks to its 8-4 record against Ivy opponents.
After falling behind early in Game 1 against the Bulldogs (10-16, 5-7 Ivy), Harvard clawed its way back to a 4-4 tie before junior first baseman Chris Rouches slammed a three-run homer in the bottom of the fifth to give the Crimson a 7-4 lead that it would maintain for the remainder of the seven-inning game.
In the nightcap, rookie starting pitcher Conner Hulse kept Harvard in the game with a gutsy two-run, eight-inning performance, and captain Harry Douglas gave the Crimson its second win of the day with a walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth.
“Both games today were really big for us, especially the way that Dartmouth has been playing in our division,” Douglas said, referring to the Rolfe-leading Big Green (14-10, 11-1), which holds a three-game lead over Harvard. “We were looking to come out here and take two today, and we got the job done.”
HARVARD 3, YALE 2
Coming into the bottom of the ninth inning in the second game of yesterday’s twinbill, the Crimson had delivered an underwhelming performance on offense, stranding 11 runners on base and scoring just two runs. 
Fortunately for Harvard, Hulse delivered a gem on the mound and freshman reliever Will Keuper shut down Yale in the top of the final inning to preserve a 2-2 tie.
Looking to reward the efforts of their rookie pitchers, the Crimson bats refused to squander yet another scoring opportunity in the bottom of the frame. With one out, sophomore center fielder Dillon O’Neill tapped a dribbler back to the mound, but Yale pitcher Eric Shultz threw the ball away, allowing O’Neill to reach first base safely and advance to second. 
The Bulldogs then intentionally walked senior second baseman Taylor Meehan to put the double play into effect, bringing Douglas to the batter’s box.
The Harvard captain delivered, poking a ground ball through the right side of the infield for a single. 
O’Neill chugged around third and headed for home, barely beating the throw from Bulldogs right fielder Zach Tobolowsky and emptying the home team’s dugout as the Crimson celebrated its walk-off win at home plate.
“I was just hoping to drive the ball,” Douglas said of his game-ending single. “I ended up getting enough of it to get it out of the infield. It feels good.”
But the Crimson would never have been in a position to win in the first place had it not been for Hulse, who spread five hits and three walks over eight innings, striking out seven batters and making just one costly mistake—a fastball left too high in the zone that Yale slugger Trygg Larsson-Danforth blasted over the right-field fence for a two-run shot.
 Hulse was occasionally dominant and consistently effective, going deep into the game and providing some respite for a depleted Harvard pitching staff.
“That was just a great effort by Hulse,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “It was a complete pitching game. Not only getting guys out, but giving us opportunities and not putting guys in scoring position.”
HARVARD 7, YALE 4
With the first game of yesterday’s doubleheader tied at four and Harvard threatening to take the lead, the bottom of the fifth inning played out like the climactic scene of a baseball comedy film.
Yale pitcher Chris Finneran lost control of the strike zone, issuing two walks to bring up Rouches and prompting a visit to the mound from his coach. 
Bulldogs skipper John Stuper, knowing the game was hanging the balance, decided to bring out his secret weapon: Robert Gruber, a towering 6’7 righty relief pitcher with a funky side-armed delivery who drew whispered murmurs from a curious, and slightly intimidated, crowd in the bleachers.
Rouches followed the script, crushing the first pitch he saw from Gruber well over the fence in left field to give the Crimson a 7-4 lead. 
“It was nice to see [Rouches] get the barrel down on the ball on a tough pitcher, especially since no one else had seen him,” Walsh said.
The Harvard bullpen then finished the job. Sophomore Dan Berardo, who had relieved junior starter Dan Zailskas in the top of the fifth, threw a scoreless sixth and handed the ball to senior Tom Stack-Babich.
Stack-Babich, who had already started to make up for a slow day at the plate with a highlight-reel leaping catch in right field earlier in the game, shut down Yale in the seventh and final frame to nail down the save and the first win of the day for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not many people have the opportunity to see the world from a bird’s eye view. But then again, not many people can pole vault like Nico Weiler.The Crimson freshman continued his strong campaign last Friday at the Harvard/Yale-Oxford/Cambridge match in New Haven, Conn., setting a new meet record of 5.20 meters in conditions that were not exactly the most ideal for outdoor pole vaulting. “I think I did pretty well,” Weiler said. “It was pretty cold, and they considered moving the pole vault indoors. Most people performed a bit below their expectations, so I was pretty fortunate to jump that high that day.”Fortunate or not, Crimson coach Jason Saretsky was nonetheless extremely pleased with Weiler’s performance.“Nico’s performance was outstanding,” Saretsky said. “He set a meet record by about a foot. With the work that he has gained in practice, we feel confident that he’s poised to have a great outdoor season.”Despite Weiler’s solid performance, the Harvard/Yale men finished one point behind their English counterparts, 10-9. For the first time since 1993, Oxford and Cambridge beat the American men. While Weiler has been jumping fairly consistently his entire freshman season, the young athlete attributed his strong showing at the HYOC competition to a series of great practices the week before. “I had some really good practice that week, so that’s probably what caused me to jump really well there,” Weiler said. Like most freshmen and sophomores who participated in their first biennial HYOC match last weekend, Weiler relished the opportunity to take part in a historic match filled with tradition. Because only four competitors are allowed to compete in a given event—two from Harvard/Yale and two from Oxford/Cambridge—this created a unique environment for the athletes. “The atmosphere surrounding [the event] was really interesting. We even had a banquet afterward where we had to dress up for it,” Weiler said. “I don’t think I’ve ever had that before.”The opportunity to compete at the HYOC meet has been yet another crucial experience to help Weiler transition from high school to the collegiate level.“Anytime you go from high school to college, there are all sorts of adjustments that need to be made,” Saretsky said. “Nico’s had to work hard to make these transitions, but he’s really rounding into form.” “Everybody is a lot older, and a lot more experienced,” Weiler said. “They’ve been doing this longer.”Despite the leg up in experience, it may well be just a matter of time before the Crimson rookie surpasses all of his competitors. A native of Germany, Weiler began pole vaulting at the age of 11. He brought his athletic talent to California when he decided to study abroad and stay in the US before coming to Harvard. In a matter of two years, Weiler was nearly unstoppable on the track-and-field circuit, amassing just about every accolade possible. Winning the Under-18 World Championships and being named as a USA Today All-American instantly made Weiler a coveted recruit.“He was highly recruited and very accomplished coming out of high school,” Saretsky said. “He was undefeated his senior year in high school. He showed a ton of potential, and he’s a great competitor.”But Weiler credits his success to his coaches, not his athletic talent.“I was very fortunate to have very good coaches,” Weiler said. “Every coach brings a different aspect of coaching. Right now, I feel like that I’m still growing in strength, so the coaches at Harvard have really helped me with that.” And though Weiler has already dominated Ivy League competition, he will continue to strive for consistency on his jumps throughout his career with the Crimson. “The more consistent he can be, the more he’s going to improve,” Saretsky said. “He’s already able to compete at a pretty high level. I think everybody involved would agree that a whole new level is waiting for him.”For now, only time will tell just how far Weiler will go, and how much higher he will vault.—Staff writer Kevin T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a debilitating doubleheader loss to Yale (16-18, 5-7 Ivy) on Sunday, Harvard had a chance for redemption yesterday at Soldiers Field.The Crimson (21-12, 7-5) took full advantage, sweeping its rival, 4-0 and 1-0, to gain some important momentum going into the Ivy League stretch run.Led by standout freshman Rachel Brown’s one-hit complete game gem and the clutch play of junior third baseman Melissa Schellberg, Harvard took it to the Bulldogs in the first game, crushing the team, 4-0.In the second contest, junior Margaux Black continued the Crimson’s dominating pitching onslaught, allowing just four hits in her first-ever complete game win.The victories leave Harvard just two games back of Dartmouth in the Ivy standings, but now, momentum is on the Crimson’s side.“We’re going to remember Sunday and [yesterday], both emotions, to propel us forward this season,” co-captain Hayley Bock said. “We will remember Sunday to fire us up, and [yesterday] to show us we can beat anyone.”HARVARD 1, YALE 0Harvard used great pitching and even better defense to secure a much-needed victory in the second game of its doubleheader, 1-0.The obvious star of the game was Black, who notched a commanding complete-game win. After coming out of the bullpen for most of the season, Black appeared right at home in the starting rotation, as she paced the Crimson through seven innings.But things would have been different had Harvard’s defense failed to back her up. The Crimson was airtight both in the air and on the ground, giving Black all the help she needed.The highlight of this strong defensive performance came when it counted most in the top of the sixth inning. With the Crimson hanging on to a 1-0 lead, Bulldog junior Ashley Sloan reached on a leadoff single. Then Black lost control, rocketing a pitch over catcher Bock’s head. Sloan looked to get into scoring position easily, but Bock had other plans, as she scrambled to the ball and gunned it to second to throw out the streaking Sloan. It was just one example of Harvard’s great play in the field, keying its important victory.“I turned around and it was in my mitt,” Bock said. “But we’ve been playing strong defense all year—it wasn’t just today.”Harvard tallied its only run on an error committed by Yale’s second baseman, as she lost a pop-up in the sun that allowed Crimson sophomore Emily Henderson to score from third. Henderson had reached on a leadoff walk, stole second, and reached third on a sacrifice bunt from classmate Ellen Macadam.HARVARD 4, YALE 0Coming off her worst performance of the season Sunday against Yale, Brown needed an answer on Tuesday.In her dominant one-hit outing, she got just that.After surrendering a soft infield hit in the second inning, Brown never looked back, retiring the last 11 batters to silence the Bulldogs.“[Brown] really bounced back [from her loss on Sunday] and focused on pitching her game,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “I thought it was a great, resilient performance.”But it looked like Harvard might squander Brown’s gem for much of the game. The team was held scoreless through four frames.Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, changed all that in the fifth. After reaching on a bloop single into center field, the junior came running home after a shot from classmate Jennifer Francis flew over the Yale’s right fielder. The relay throw came in hot, and looked to have Schellberg as she headed home. The junior, however, would not be denied, as she lept to the right and then lunged out with her left hand to touch the base, evading the tag and notching the Crimson’s first run in the most dramatic of ways.“She made a perfect slide at home,” Allard said. “And coming up with a clutch hit later, she was fantastic.”The next inning, it was more Schellberg, as she led Harvard’s offensive outburst with a bases-clearing double that tallied another two runs for the Crimson. Freshman Whitney Shaw started things off with a single, and junior Jessica Pledger, who is also a Crimson photographer, got on board with a single of her own. Schellberg’s double plated pinch runners Black and freshman Eve Rosenbaum.Schellberg came home on a single off the bat of rookie pinch hitter Jane Alexander, giving the junior two RBI and two runs on the day. That was all Harvard needed, as Brown pitched a perfect seventh to preserve the win.—Staff writer Walter E. Howell can be reached at wehowell@fas.harvard.edu.

Important breaking news: The Harvard Square Post Office is closing half an hour earlier everyday starting May 11.
Actually...
Important: False.
Breaking: False.
News: Undetermined.
Ann Powers, a spokesperson for the Boston district of USPS, called the shift "an economical decision." Apparently, there wasn't enough "foot traffic" during the weekday 6:00-6:30 timeslot for the Mount Auburn Street post office to remain open for that grueling half hour.
As to why the decision was made now instead of a year ago, Powers’ response: "They don’t make these decisions overnight. They do studies." Code for "Oh crap, the economy is burning! Let's cut half an hour worth of salaries and power costs per day!"? We think so.
FlyBy is happy to report, however, that this reduction in hours hasn’t fazed the resilient Harvard student. Ricky Kuperman ’11, who was at the post office earlier today, said he doesn’t usually bother with snail mail. Neither does Dominik P. Nieszporowski ’12, who said his visit to the post office yesterday was his "first time in here."
But Nieszporowski didn't even need postal workers for his visit: he used the Automated Postal Center (a machine that issues stamps, prints packaging labels, and only takes credit cards), which will remain open 24/7, Powers said. And if the Harvard student wants that certain human touch when sending his or her mail, Powers had advice for that as well:
"We’re open in Boston at the Fort Point station until midnight." That's only 4.3 miles away, says Google Maps. And you thought the Quad was far.

Harvard students are some of the most technologically savvy people in the world. We’ve got our iPhones, Blackberries, and Twitters to keep track of every piece of information we would ever need to know—even the Q Guide is going completely digital! It’s only logical that the next step would be to try to find love online. That’s where new online dating website, www.fasDate.com, comes in. The site was launched on April 2nd as a place for “smart users to find love.” Although fasDate does not stand for Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the name, an acronym for “find-a-smart-date,” may elicit a chuckle from you computer-savvy programmers out there as written in CamelCase.  More details after the jump.
Unlike other online dating sites such as match.com or eHarmony, fasDate is completely free. Users can also instant message and video-chat each other, as well as create groups and blogs. Founder Andrew Lach believes that because of fasDate’s community of users, innovative software, and free price tag, it will soon break down the negative stigma surrounding online dating. “I think that in the future, rather soon, that to not use the internet to meet people will seem a little outdated,” he said.
 So who is considered a “smart user?” As the web site claims, “To us, being smart is defined by behavior, not education or IQ.” Still, Lach is targeting Harvard students and other Boston-area students with an aggressive flyer campaign.
 Lach, 32, attended Vanderbilt and has lived in Boston for the last ten years, where he has worked at the Human Genome Project and the Harvard-MIT Broad Institute. Although he is happily married, he says he created the site because he remembers what it was like to be looking for that special someone.
One thing FlyBy has kind of omitted: The site currently only has seven users.....but you could be next! As Lach claims, “Everyone’s standing around the pool waiting to dive in.” After all, what have you got to lose?
