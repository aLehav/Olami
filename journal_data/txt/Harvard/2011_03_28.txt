After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing its first home matchup in nearly three weeks, the Harvard men’s volleyball team aimed at putting a stop to its recent four-game losing streak as it faced off against NYU at the Malkin Athletic Center on Friday night.
But despite an exciting win in the second set, the Crimson (7-10, 0-4 Hay) was unable to overcome the fierce offense of the Violets (15-7, 3-3 Hay) and lost, 3-1.
“We were disappointed we didn’t have any defense,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “That was the difference. They hit over .400, and we hit just over .200. You never win a volleyball match with that differential. We couldn’t stop them.”
The Crimson finished the match hitting .214, while NYU ended the night with almost double that, hitting .424.
“I think it’s safe to say it wasn’t our best game,” sophomore setter Rob Lothman said. “Everybody would probably say the same. It was tough gaining a little momentum today.”
And this was certainly the case for the first set.
Though the score remained close early on, by the middle of the set the Violets were able to pull away with a five-point lead, one which they held onto for the remainder of the set, winning, 25-18.
But Harvard came back strong in the second set, playing what was the most thrilling frame of the night.
With the score tied 17 times and the lead switching hands nine times, the two teams kept the fans on the edge of their seats the entire set.
Aside from a 7-3 Crimson lead at the start, neither team enjoyed another advantage greater than one point until the very end of the set.
That is when, after tying the score at 22-22, Harvard took charge, scoring the next three points to win the set, 25-22.
The Crimson had 15 kills contributed by six players—junior co-captain Matt Jones, Lothman, and freshmen Chris Gibbons, Michael Owen, Kyle Rehkemper and Nick Madden. It also finished the set with its highest hitting percentage of the night, .385.
Despite this, Harvard could not keep the momentum going into the third set.
The Crimson fell into an early 4-0 hole and was unable to climb its way out, losing, 25-15.
It made for the third straight set in which NYU hit over .500.
“We were working on defense a lot this week,” Baise said. “We had been blocking really well. In the beginning of the season that was really our strength, but we were struggling offensively. Our offense has gotten a little bit better, but our defense struggled tonight.”
In the fourth set, Harvard found a surge in its drive following its gain of an early 2-0 advantage.
Though the Crimson held onto the lead for most of the set, the Violets came very close to taking it at several different points and were never far behind, tying the score eight times.
But once again Harvard faced difficulty in holding onto its momentum, and after the final tie of the set at 19-19, the Crimson was able to take only one of the final seven points. NYU ultimately won the set, 25-20.
“We didn’t make some of the miscellaneous plays on defense that you need to beat a team that’s just as good as you are,” Lothman said. “So that allowed them to take the extra game.”
Though Harvard was able to make slight gains in its offense, with Jones and Rehkemper each tallying double-digit kills, the team still sees room for improvement in all facets of its game.
“We really just have to cut down on our errors,” Rehkemper said. “We made a lot of hitting errors, and I think our hitting percentage was pretty low for the match as a whole. We missed a lot of serves early on which we need to start nailing, because that’s just free points that you’re giving away, but other than that I think we played some good defense. There were some upsides to it, though; they just came out really hard, and we just weren’t able to match it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Braving the cold and blustery conditions on Saturday morning, the Radcliffe lightweight and heavyweight crews out-rowed their opponents on the Charles River in the first race of the spring season.
The lightweight team squared off against Tulsa and MIT, while its heavyweight counterparts rowed head to head against the Golden Hurricane in the 2000-meter race.
“We’ve been gearing for this upcoming season all year especially during the fall and winter,” co-captain Olivia Coffey said. “We had done the work that was necessary. We just had to put in the effort. The race wasn’t going to feel good because it was freezing cold, but we wanted to start the season off right.”
The first race of the morning did not start as well as anticipated for the Black and White. Tulsa bested both the Radcliffe A and Radcliffe B varsity fours by a margin of 4.1 seconds and 16.5 seconds, respectively, finishing at a time of 8:55.0.
But the Black and White turned the tables quickly in the second varsity eight race. Radcliffe, with a time of 7:48.0, dominated the Golden Hurricane by 30.2 seconds, while the third varsity trailed Tulsa by 44 seconds.
The Black and White’s second eight immediately claimed the lead and held it throughout the entire race, consistently widening the gap between themselves and the Golden Hurricane.
“We knew we needed to get out there and go for it right from the start,” said co-captain Rachel Rauh, who coxed the second varsity eight. “We were confident that we could do pretty well. We just wanted to push every stroke regardless of what was going on next to us, whether we were ahead or behind.”
The first varsity eight carried the momentum into its race against Tulsa in the next race of the morning.
As soon as the race started, Radcliffe came out strong and powered down the course, leading by 14 seconds by the 1000-meter mark.
But the Black and White did not let down its guard. Instead, it extended its lead by another 14 seconds in the second half, crossing the line at 7:25.9 for a 28-second win.
“As soon as we came down off the start, we had a strong, sustainable rhythm,” said Coffey, who stroked the first varsity eight. “We could increase our margin steadily throughout the race. We were consistent, and that’s what we wanted throughout the race.”
Then the scene was set for the lightweight team to take over against both the Engineers and the Golden Hurricane.
Because Tulsa only brought one varsity four team, the first varsity eights of both Radcliffe and MIT divided into two boats for this race.
The Black and White A entry took the lead right away and maintained it throughout the race, beating the second-place Golden Hurricane by 18.7 seconds, finishing with a time of 8:50.4.
“I think it was a great first race out there,” said junior Kelly McCarthy, who rowed in the bow seat of the A four. “We did the best we could with our start given the conditions, and we just did the best we could. It was fun to have the other four out there as well—though nothing is ever completely sure until the end of the race.”
The Radcliffe B entry had a far tougher race. The Black and White and Tulsa fought for the lead between themselves, until Radcliffe claimed it at the 1000-meter mark.
But the Black and White boat hit a boat-stopping crab, allowing the Golden Hurricane to take the lead by a margin of six seconds.
In the second varsity eight race, Radcliffe only competed against the Engineers.
The Black and White started off strong and consistent and took the lead and held it throughout the entire race.
Radcliffe finished the 2000-meter race at a time of 8:33.0, 40.2 seconds faster than the Engineers.
The Black and White hopes to build off of this success in their remaining races of the season.
“It put us in a very good place for us to build off of. Tulsa is not in our league, but it serves as a good point of comparison for teams in the Midwest, South, and West,” Rauh said. “It gives us a perspective of where we stand. It gives us a lot of confidence for the rest of the season.”
“Working on last year’s results, our performance across the board give us an idea of where we are,” Coffey added. “I think we can do better. We have a lot of inexperienced rowers that are good but can do better. It is always really good to start off on a positive note, and we are all really hungry for some wins from our duals and the rest of the season.”

In sports, everything can change in the blink of an eye, as the No. 17 Harvard men’s lacrosse team learned Saturday afternoon.
Late in a tie game at Scully-Fahey Field in Hanover, N.H., the Crimson (5-2, 1-1 Ivy) needed to contain Dartmouth (4-3, 1-1) for a just few seconds in order to send the game to overtime.
The Big Green had possession with the chance for the final shot. It fired on net but missed, and the ball soared out of bounds with 4.7 seconds left on the clock, with Dartmouth retaining possession behind the net.
Big Green attackman Nikki Dysenchuk then took the ball behind Harvard sophomore goalie Harry Krieger, driving from the right side. He beat one Harvard defender and fired a low line-drive shot that blew past Krieger as time expired, giving Dartmouth a 9-8 victory.
“He was able to get around a defender and get a shot off,” sophomore Alex White said of the final play. “We were expecting him to feed into the crease; we weren’t expecting a dodge.”
It was a heartbreaking loss for the Crimson, which had just completed a late surge of its own, pouring in two goals in the contest’s final three minutes to tie things up.
“That’s always a tough way to lose,” junior attack Jeff Cohen said. “You fight hard for an entire game; to come up a little bit short [is tough].”
The Big Green scored not only extremely late but also very early, with junior John DeChiaro beating Krieger just seven seconds into the contest. But junior Terry White responded 40 seconds later for Harvard to tie the game at 1-1.
Despite the early blitz, neither team could find the net again until Cohen beat Dartmouth junior goalie Fergus Campbell to give the Crimson the lead with 44 seconds remaining in the opening period.
Cohen’s second score of the game, coming 3:04 into the second quarter, was sandwiched by two Chris Costabile goals for the Big Green that tied the game at 3-3 heading into the half.
Dartmouth pulled ahead early in the third period, when midfielder Rhett Miller beat Krieger at 13:33. But Harvard responded with two quick goals of its own—the first by sophomore midfielder Ryan Stevens and the second by Cohen, giving the junior three on the afternoon. Co-captain Dean Gibbons assisted on Cohen’s score, his third assist of the game and 10th of the season.
“They ran a zone [that] was pretty soft in the middle,” Cohen said. “My teammates found me. Dean had some great passes today. I credit them.”
But Big Green midfielder Adam Boardman tied the game with his first goal of the season at 5:08, and attack Kip Dooley fired one past Krieger two minutes later to put Dartmouth up, 6-5, heading into the final period.
Fifty-three seconds into the fourth, White found Stevens, who beat Campbell to tie the game at six.  But Costabile responded at 10:12 with his third of the game, and junior Drew Tunney added another score at 3:47 to give the Big Green a two-goal advantage.
But the Crimson attack would not quit. It turned to Saturday’s two go-to scorers to bring it back into the game, and they delivered.
Stevens earned a hat trick off of Gibbons’ fourth assist with 2:25 remaining to cut the deficit to one. After Boardman was whistled for a tripping penalty at 1:39, Harvard had a man-up chance to tie the contest, and Cohen delivered again.  The junior rifled a quick shot at Campbell that was denied, but senior Matt Hull picked up the rebound and found Cohen, who beat Campbell on his second attempt for his fourth score of the afternoon and 18th of the season.
“[Stevens and Cohen] really shot the ball well today,” Alex White said.
With the game tied, Dartmouth won the ensuing faceoff and kept control for the rest of the game. After a shot by freshman Jeff Perkins sailed high with six seconds remaining, Dysenschuk beat Krieger as time expired to give the Big Green the win.
Campbell had 17 saves for Dartmouth, while Krieger had six for the Crimson. Harvard accumulated more shots (41-26), won more ground balls (37-31), had fewer turnovers (19-18), and won more faceoffs (13-7) than Dartmouth but nonetheless could not emerge from Hanover with the victory.
“Dartmouth kind of suckered us into their game plan,” White said. “They held on to the ball a lot. We weren’t able to capitalize on opportunities as well as we would’ve liked...the game came down to the last play; unfortunately we let it get to that point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yo-Yo Ma ’76 evokes a sense of historical grandeur comparable to that of his predecessor Pablo Casals—arguably the first virtuoso cellist in history—as an artist established firmly, and maybe inaccessibly, in the traditional canon. However, Ma returns to his alma mater with innovative and decidely untraditional flair. Last Sunday, Ma performed at Sanders Theatre with the Silk Road Ensemble, the performance division of the Silk Road Project, to kick off their renewed collaboration with Harvard University. Founded in 1988 by Ma, the non-profit arts and educational organization  cultivates musical collaboration that draws from traditional music all over the world, with a particular focus on musical traditions of areas that were once along the Silk Road from East Asia to the Middle East.
True to its mission, the Silk Road Ensemble consists of musicians who tour and collaborate internationally. Each performance or recording usually uses 10 to 25 musicians of the entire ensemble, each of whom is a master of his or her instrument. The variety of instrumentalists is wide: musicians play everything from the pipa, a Chinese lute, to the Galician bagpipe. The group was described by Joseph Gramley, a percussionist with the ensemble, as a “group of us with high musicianship ... and a friendly family.” Wu Man, the group’s pipa player, described the ensemble as a group of musicians who are inspired by the folk musicians who “travel from town, playing music for weddings and funerals.” According to Man,  “music is part of their lives, and music is the spiritual part of our lives.”
Ma first developed the Silk Road Project at Harvard in an effort to connect the world’s neighborhoods together in a multicultural, interdisciplinary musical exchange. According to Laura Freid, the project’s CEO and executive director, a faculty member mentioned to Ma that the concept sounded like what the Silk Road had done, and the Silk Road Project was born. “Just when we were thinking that it would be nice for [the Silk Road Project] to be based in an institution, [Harvard University President Drew G. Faust] was thinking that the arts should have a much more important place in higher education and that art-making was as important as any other part of learning,” Freid continued.
Freid and other members of the ensemble spoke of taking full advantage of this affiliation with Harvard University. “We are very open to collaboration,” said Freid. “Yo-Yo and I met together with the dean of the Business School to talk about cultural entrepreneurship [and how it] gives an audience modern context to an ancient [musical] tradition.” In keeping with these efforts, last July the Silk Road Project moved their offices from Rhode Island to Allston, on Harvard property, so that they could have a closer relationship with the school.
In celebration of their renewed their presence on campus, the Ensemble displayed a beautiful synthesis of musical traditions in their Sanders Theatre performance.  “Night Thoughts,” a pipa solo featuring and written by Wu Man, flowed brilliantly into the percussive sounds of Mark Suter’s “Weavings,” a virtuosic percussion-shaker experiment. Only Rabih Abou-Khalil’s “Norma’s Secret” was perhaps repetitive and unwieldy in composition, though not through any fault of the performers. The ensemble’s exquisite attention to the detail of their selections became clear as the concert continued, with many of these pieces—even though they were technically from different musical traditions—featuring congruous harmonies and rhythms.
In pieces like Kayhan Kalhor’s “Silent City,” a heavily improvisational work featuring kamancheh, a Persian bowed string instrument,  Western strings, and percussion, the similar sounds of the kamancheh and strings blended beautifully; at times the listener could not tell who was playing what. As one of three encores, the ensemble participated in an improvisational rhythmic exercise that drew upon each member’s impressive sense of rhythm. The diverse group of instruments blended when necessary, but were distinctive in themselves—“Muiñeiras from Cancionero Musical de Galicia” or “¡Chayraq!: Rough Guide to a Modern Day Tawantinsuyu” contrasted the ensemble’s instruments most effectively.
Most incredibly, perhaps, was the group’s obvious desire to connect with the audience. In between pieces, Ma and other members would speak to the audience about their instruments, their experiences, and the pieces themselves. As Ma said at the concert, “it has always been my dream to see the Chinese pipa playing next to the oud, its ancestral instrument.” In the synthesis of their experimental nature and traditional sounds, the group has displayed an innovation that does not seek simply to perfect a traditional sound, but also looks outward to the cultural traditions of neighboring lands.

In 1827, the young composer Hector Berlioz attended performances of several plays by William Shakespeare on the Parisian Left Bank. The Bard’s artistry left an indelible mark on him; in his autobiography, “Mémoires,” he compares the experience to being struck by a thunderbolt. Shakespeare’s enormous musical influence was celebrated in the last of the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s (BSO) “Underscore Fridays”—a new, more casual BSO series that allows concertgoers to hear from the conductor directly and socialize after the performance by having an early 7 p.m. start time. Drawing on pieces inspired by “The Tempest,” the BSO gave their already formidable classical line-up an extra charge with the presence of conductor-composer Thomas Adés, who contributed two of the four selected works.
The result of these musical selections is a kind of “Tempest Greatest Hits,” throwing together Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “The Tempest, Symphonic Fantasia after Shakespeare, Op. 18” and Finnish composer Jean Sibelius’ “Prelude” (Op. 109, No. 1) and “Suite No. 1” (Opus 109, No. 2) from “The Tempest,” his incidental music to a Danish production of the play. Adés, a forceful and thrillingly talented young British composer, arranged the program himself. The result is a classical music blockbuster, high on energy and entertainment but occasionally lacking in the nuance and subtlety that marks Shakespeare’s text.
Tchaikovsky and Sibelius relish the opportunity to evoke the storm section of the play through their music. Both feature suitable bombast and panic, but while Tchaikovsky’s version builds more slowly, opening with lush passages reminiscent of the beginning of Richard Wagner’s “Das Rheingold,” Sibelius nails more accurately the feeling of being caught in a violent storm at sea. The rapid rise and fall of the brass and strings perfectly capture the nausea and panic of Shakespeare’s sailors and the swelling of titanic waves. The works are challenging, but the orchestra responded excellently with tightness and precision. The percussion section was especially effective, and came into its own during these storm sequences.
In the short selections provided, neither composer fully suggests the magic and eeriness of Prospero’s enchanted island. However, Adés does present a lovely personification of the sprite Ariel in the Tchaikovsky, and the difficult and rapidly skittering violins were held together well by the string section. Overall, however, Adés’ rendition of the Sibelius was more effective, the sweeping passages and depth of the orchestra punctuated by occasional martial undertones; the percussion in particular provided a deep, frightening sonic boom during these sequences. Often dismissed during his lifetime and through most of the 20th century, Sibelius’ moment may be coming. He has been underrated for far too long, and Adés’ choice to feature him on the program is representative of a larger revisionist trend to recognize his massive contribution to modern classical music. That the orchestra featured his work so confidently is a gesture of this new respect.
Adés’ own contributions, however, do not suffer in comparison. His first work, a violin concerto entitled “Concentric Paths,” (Op. 23, 2005) featured acclaimed violinist Anthony Marwood, who brought forth Adés’ work with great brio. The piece has a fantastic alien weirdness that recalls early electronic music, and the high-pitched whine of the violins bring to mind the processed beats and bleeps of moog synthesizers and popular musicians like Aphex Twin. The third movement of the concerto, “Rounds,” has an almost Morricone-like quality, with an ostensibly lighter tone than the movements that preceded it but a pronounced undercurrent of menace.
Although not explicitly inspired by “The Tempest,” Adés’ decision to include “Concentric Paths” is understood in light of his second contribution—selected scenes from his 2004 opera “The Tempest”—that concluded the evening. The same eccentric flair that was so affecting in “Concentric Paths” is echoed to marvelous effect in capturing the essence of the island’s magic. Adés’ interpretation of Shakespeare’s famous “Full Fathom Five” song is breathtaking, a high-pitched call seemingly from the very depths of the sea that perfectly captures the playwright’s evocation of the “rich and strange.” Sadly, this moment was all too brief, and the rest of the selections from Adés’ opera seem rather more conventional.
In terms of thrills and entertainment, therefore, Adés has delivered superbly, but his musical selections did not fully allow us a more complete look into the nuances of some of these pieces and of Shakespeare’s text. Significant parts of “The Tempest” are missing from this program–Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo feature only in brief allusions, and the selections seemed to concentrate too closely on the lovers Ferdinand and Miranda, who form arguably the least interesting relationship in the original text. The comparison between different composers’ musical renditions was interesting, but there is so much more in Tchaikovsky and Sibelius that Adés could have showcased. With this in mind, perhaps the concert did not feel as varied and multi-faceted as it could have been. Nevertheless, this was an inspirational conclusion to a laudable and innovative series of concerts by the BSO.

Last Friday, the Bach Society Orchestra (BachSoc) filled Sanders Theatre with the 19th-century sounds of its third seasonal concert, exchanging the stage of Paine Hall for Harvard’s most daunting performance space. Despite appearing small in their new surroundings, the chamber orchestra proved themselves quite at home. BachSoc provided dynamic and engaging renditions of three highly challenging pieces that consistently compelled and only occasionally revealed some orchestral weaknesses.
Friday’s performance held extra significance as it was dubbed “A Concert to Benefit the Victims of the Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan.” With 50 percent of the profits going directly to the Red Cross relief effort in Japan and “Harvard for Japan” booths lining the entrance hall to collect further donations, the concert was an admirable gesture of support for Japan in a time of crisis.
The concert began with a performance of German composer Felix Mendelssohn’s “Overture to ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream,’ Op. 21” that effectively captured the delicacy and excitement of its namesake to usher the audience into the mysterious world of Romanticism. Appropriately, the orchestra infused the piece with a sense of magic and playfulness. The violins displayed excellent dynamic control under the baton of music director Yuga J. Cohler ’11, while the remainder of the orchestra darted in and out with contrapuntal interruptions. All in all, the piece proved to be a short and exciting display of the orchestra’s mastery of textural contrast. Other than some egregious intonation problems in the horns, the piece danced away without misstep.
For the second piece, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “Concerto for Violin in D Major, Op. 35,” the violins welcomed soloist Ryu Goto ’11, a Physics concentrator with a long list of professional achievements including performances in many of the world’s most renowned concert halls, as well as recordings for Deutsche Grammophon Records. From his first notes, Goto brought forth a dark and expressive tone, navigating demanding technical runs and passages of affective lyricism with equal adeptness. His cadenza in the first movement was an awe-inspiring series of attacks and textures that displayed mastery of every mood and register of the violin in alternating aggressively stabs and soft caresses of the strings. The Tchaikovsky concerto served as the perfect vehicle for Goto’s tremendous talent; despite the fact that the piece had originally been deemed “unplayable” by fin-de-siècle violin virtuoso Leopold Auer, Goto’s rendition sounded effortless, and, other than one accidental screech, flawless. His instant standing ovation was much deserved.
The orchestra behind Goto provided responsive and controlled accompaniment, although it was marred by some inconsistencies. The orchestra unobtrusively supported Goto for much of the first two movements while conserving its energy for the sudden crescendo that signals the start of the finale, a leap executed so tremendously that several in the audience physically recoiled. As one of the loudest moments thus far, the concerto’s finale silenced all doubts about the small orchestra’s ability to fill the cavernous Sanders Theatre: they delivered a gigantic sound. However, they faltered somewhat during softer passages, sounding uncomfortably heterogeneous, especially with the intrusion of occasional blips by the horns. Tchaikovsky’s intriciate tempo changes also presented identifiable difficulty for the orchestra—sometimes Goto would establish a new tempo but several bars would ensue before the orchestra comfortably caught up.
Concluding the concert on a predictable note, BachSoc performed an expressive rendition of Brahms’s “Symphony No. 2 in D Major, Op. 73.” Though the piece is undoubtedly a gorgeous study in Romantic lyricism and Brahmsian thematic development, perhaps the selection would have proved more exciting in a less typical program. After all, if one notes the life spans of these three composers—1809-1847 for Mendelssohn, 1840-1893 for Tchaikovsky, and 1833-1897 for Brahms—it is immediately evident that BachSoc developed a focused program at the expense of temporal variety. Despite the orchestra’s masterful rendition, a work from the orchestra’s namesake would have been greatly welcomed by the concert’s end.
Organizational considerations aside, the Brahms Symphony flowed smoothly, with Cohler displaying masterful attention to dynamic nuance. Once again, this piece called for a variety of tempi and textures—demands that the orchestra met beautifully despite a few shaky instances of orchestral disunity. The highlight of the symphony was the daintily dancing third movement, the woodwind section displaying an articulation that echoed their delicate precision in the earlier Mendelssohn. As the last notes resounded through Sanders Theatre, it was evident that BachSoc had delivered an enjoyable and often outstanding evening of music, its flaws rarely outshining a presentation fit for Harvard’s most magnificent stage.

Choreographer, performer, and director Frederick “Ricky” D. Kuperman ’11 is a psychology concentrator in Lowell House. He has choreographed numerous productions and worked with many organizations on campus, including the Harvard Ballet Company, the Harvard Contemporary Dance Ensemble, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get into dance?
Frederick D. Kuperman: I started training as a gymnast pretty early on in my childhood. My brother [Jeffrey D. Kuperman] began dancing before I did. I went to one of his shows, and I was very impressed and engaged by what he was doing.
THC: Describe your dance and choreography beginnings at Harvard.
FDK: When I arrived on campus as a freshman, it was a difficult transition because the focus was less on athleticism and virtuosic movement and more on the conceptual elements of dance. Adjusting to that change in perspective was a challenge at first, but it also expanded my horizons and convinced me to start making my own work. An important year in terms of my growth as a choreographer, dancer, and actor was sophomore year, when I began to work with Catherine C. Videt ’09. I worked on two shows that she directed that year, and they really expanded my understanding of what theater could be. Our relationship still continues to this day. We’ve worked together on many projects, including two recent pieces, “One Arm and a Leg” and “Hold Music.”
THC: Can you tell me more about your directorial debut, “In a Moment?”
FDK: “In a Moment” is a short dance film. It was a pleasure to explore storytelling in this unconventional form. It’s really interesting to see how choreography transfers onto film and to see what a particular movement is like from such a close distance—one that is impossible with conventional stage choreographies. There is a lot of potential to explore this marriage between choreography and cinema. I think with “In a Moment” we took a step towards beginning our exploration of joining these two media.  An amazing example of a dance-for-camera work is “Amelia” by Edouard Lock. I also love [Canadian independent filmmaker] Moze Mossanen, a director with whom I had the privilege of working.
THC: Describe the influence that your brother has had on you.
FDK: We grew up together, we danced together, and we did high school theater and martial arts together. A lot of our influences growing up were identical. While we are our own people during the year, whenever we get a chance to work together, we jump on it. All of our professional projects have been done in a collaborative way. So many times when we’re working together, I find him finishing my sentences. But although we’re so in sync, it’s great when we have divergent opinions, because it means we spark a real debate and it pushes our work to a deeper level. It wouldn’t be an accurate picture of me if I didn’t talk about him.
THC: In what ways do your academic pursuits relate to your choreography?
FDK: Studying psychology at Harvard has undoubtedly influenced my development as a choreographer and director. Especially when telling stories, an understanding of the way humans think is instrumental in crafting three-dimensional characters. More than that, an understanding of the mind-body connection has been helpful even in purely kinesthetic explorations.
THC: Do you plan to continue dancing after graduation?
FDK: If all goes as planned, I’ll be in New York next year working on a new physical theater piece. There’s also a music video project and a short film in the works. I intend to work as a performer, choreographer, and director. It’s a little bit frightening, but the uncertainty is exciting. I know that it’s what I need to do right now. When I’m making work, it’s when I’m at my sharpest, happiest, and most fulfilled.
THC: If you could pick any era to be a performer in, which one would it be?
FDK: I would transport instantly to the Golden Age of Hollywood [a period loosely defined as 1930-1960 in American cinema] and would make friends with Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor. We would do a sequel to “Singin’ In The Rain.”

How does geography  influence myths and emotions? “Atlas: Map and Myth,” an exhibit on display until April 10 in Harvard’s Center for Government and International Studies (CGIS), explores this question. The art show, the second annual student-curated exhibit in this space, features the works of nine Harvard artists. In varying and creative ways, the works presented all explore the concept of physical space. Some focus on the objective act of mapping and others emphasize the subjective perceptions of the individual.
Originally intended to be an exhibit focused on globalization, the theme changed when the curators received the student art submissions. As Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) concentrator and exhibit co-curator Shannon E. Mulshine ’12 wrote in an email, the show’s theme “was inspired by the conversation we sensed between the pieces.”
These pieces, unified by a general theme of ‘location,’ vary widely in their interpretation of environment and space. “One underlying organizational principle,” Mulshine wrote, “was this procession from works that were interested in spatial mapping toward works that dealt with cultural myths of place.”
“Map Your Memories,” the far-reaching piece of New York City native Rebecca A. Cooper ’10, falls squarely into the spatial mapping category. Inspired by [Italian novelist] Italo Calvino’s book “Invisible Cities” and a summer job which had her make a map of public artwork in New York City, Cooper’s art explores the unavoidable bias of a mapmaker’s perspective. Two summers ago, she handed out 700 blank maps of Manhattan and asked New Yorkers to fill them with images and memories of their lives in the city. Cooper collected the ideas of as diverse a group as possible, eventually receiving 90 responses, including one from a 90-year-old, one from a 4-year-old, and even one from a homeless man.
A map is both a “portrait of a place and a self-portrait of the person who made it,” Cooper said, “A city is comprised of as many invisible cultures as there are people.” One person divided Manhattan into neighborhoods of relief and fear, while another pinpointed the location where he met his spouse. In the most beautiful piece, one subject filled the city map with images of bricks and the silhouette of a tree and birds.
Music concentrator Benjamin C. Cosgrove ’10, who grew up in Methuen, MA, also chose a subject close to home. “Commonwealth,” Cosgrove’s senior thesis, incorporates his original instrumental music, field recordings of sounds across Massachusetts, and interviews with state residents. This compelling and powerful testament to the Bay State moves geographically from the west to east as the subjects fluidly transition from the Berkshires to Boston. “I used the balance between the different types of sound to reflect patterns of development,” Cosgrove wrote in an email. “The instrumental parts basically represent the natural landscape, and the voices and other human sounds stand for developed or otherwise altered land, like cities and suburbs.”
“Massachusetts is three and a half hours wide and 45 minutes deep,” one resident observes in “Commonwealth,” his voice slowly replaced by chirping crickets, and, finally, expressive string instruments. Crunching leaves and the sound of farm machinery lend his recording a nostalgic quality. “I’m still in Massachusetts,” one woman wistfully recalls in this moving testament to Cosgrove’s home state.
In “Child Play,” a film narrated in both Russian and English, Lauren J. Ianni ’12 contrasts the playgrounds in Soviet Russia with those in the United States. The narrator explains that in American playgrounds, “the carefully-calculated design decides how the child will travel.” Yet in a Soviet playground, which is marked by less color and order, the children are not artificially protected and directed. Instead, they can explore the area in an uninhibited manner, free to use their imaginations as they move about the space.
The rough quality of the film, coupled with its frantic and dark atmosphere, presents an analysis of play space with a seriousness usually reserved for descriptions of foreign lands. With narration like “thoughts are made of plastic, metal, wood, rubber,” the audio element of this multimedia piece provides a unique perspective about the influence of structure on thought.
The senior thesis projects of Rachel D. Libeskind ’11 and Julia A. Rooney ’11 are also part of the exhibit, as are the works of two freshmen, Lutai Ju ’14 and Inanna L. Carter ’14. Photography by doctoral candidates Justin Hoke and Alexander S. Young completes the gallery.
“Atlas” unites memory, history, and geography in a distinctive exhibit that explores the impact of the physical world on thought. People, the exhibition posits, are shaped not only by ideas and interactions with others, but also by their relationship to the environment in which they live.

After another great season, a Harvard fencer has captured another individual national title.
On the women’s side, freshman Alexandra Kiefer took home the gold medal and national title in the foil, while juniors Noam Mills and co-captain Caroline Vloka placed second in epée and third in the saber, respectively, at the NCAA Fencing Championships this past weekend hosted by Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.
After two days on top of the women’s foil standings, Kiefer remained only one of four fencers left in contention for the foil title. Among the other three fencers were 2008 Olympian and two-time national champion Doris Willette of Penn State, Princeton freshman Eve Levin, and St. John’s University sophomore Evgeniya Kirpicheva. In the semifinals of the tournament, Kiefer claimed a narrow 15-12 victory over Kirpicheva to reach the finals, while the fourth-seeded Levin was able to stage an upset over top seed Willette to make the final an All-Ivy affair. In the women’s foil final—the final match of the four-day tournament—Kiefer waltzed away with the title with a commanding 15-7 victory over Levin.
For Kiefer, this has been a dream of a season.
“I feel like it hasn’t even hit me yet,” Kiefer said. “Obviously I’m excited. This season has been a lot of fun, and I’m glad that I finished with good results. It was a lot of hard work and especially practicing with the team gave me a lot of motivation.”
The freshman became the Crimson’s third female national champion ever and the second female champion in recent years, after Vloka claimed the saber title last year.
For the second year in a row, Mills snagged the No. 1 seed in the epée after round-robin play.
En route to the final, she was matched up against a familiar foe—Penn State’s Margherita Guzzi Vincenti.
In last year’s championship, Vincenti narrowly defeated Mills in the final round of the epée; in this year’s semifinals, Mills beat Vincenti decisively, 15-8, to knock her out of title contention.
Thus Mills reached the final bout of competition after the knockout stage but was unable to take the final step in claiming a gold medal. In the championship round of the epée, Mills fell narrowly, 8-7, to Notre Dame’s Courtney Hurley to come away with a silver medal.
A title rematch was similarly waged in the women’s saber between perennial foes: the Crimson’s Vloka and Duke’s Rebecca Ward. In the 2009 tournament, Vloka and Ward clashed in the saber final, with Ward walking away with the title after a decisive victory over Vloka. Last year, the two clashed again in the final round, but this time with Vloka gaining the upper hand and the title.
This year, the duel between Vloka and Ward was waged during the semifinals. In a closely fought matchup, Ward managed to gain the upper hand and trumped Vloka, 15-11, to enter into the final round, where she then defeated Princeton’s Eliza Stone to win her second sabre title in three years.
Rounding out the Harvard women’s performance at NCAAs were sophomores Katherine Chou and Felicia Sun, who placed 15th and 23rd in the foil and epée, respectively.
On the men’s side, although the Crimson was unable to claim individual national titles, its five male qualifiers all posted consistent performances, contributing to the Harvard team’s overall sixth-place finish in the Championships—won by Notre Dame.
The men were led by freshman Michael Raynis, who placed sixth in the epée, and Lucas Lin, who placed 14th in the foil, in addition to sophomore Thomas Kolasa and junior captain Valentin Staller, who placed 14th and ninth in the saber, respectively. Rounding out the squad were junior James Hawrot and sophomore Tommaso DiRobilant, who each placed 18th in the epée and foil, respectively.
As the Harvard fencing team looks ahead, what is certain is that the future looks particularly bright for the Crimson. After this season, Harvard’s fencing squads will graduate only two seniors and lose Mills, who will no longer be eligible. With nearly all of the Crimson’s standout fencers—Vloka, Kiefer, Staller, Kolasa and Raynis—returning next year, Harvard is all but guaranteed continued strong showings in the seasons to come.
“Even though it’s going to be difficult to replace Noam, we have three additional people coming in next year who should help us in that department,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “Overall, we are anticipating some great performances again next year, but this year, especially on the women’s side, was quite special.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lovely D. Nicolas stomps and dances across the Lowell Lecture Hall stage as her mother, Elizabeth A. McAlister, speaks at the podium. McAlister, Associate Professor of Religion at Wesleyan College, is weaving together Haitian history, dance theory, and how she met her daughter at a dance celebration in Haiti. Nicolas, with swinging hips and jerking shoulders, gives her mother’s words powerful bodily life. Then a rattling drum rhythm kicks up, and suddenly Nicolas is urging the audience to dance in the center of the stage. For five minutes, the music transforms the hall into a pulsing crowd of shuffling feet and moving bodies. McAlister and Nicolas’ piece, entitled “Move Your Words,” kicked off—and epitomized—the Committee on African Studies’ African Dance Diaspora symposium, which convened from March 25 to March 27.
“We were intent upon having not just a series of panels in which people read papers. We also wanted presenters and participants to get up and demonstrate what they’re thinking about these things,” said Senior Lecturer in Folklore and Mythology Deborah D. Foster, who organized the event with Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) Social Anthropology doctoral student Sharon Freda Kivenko.
With an emphasis on interdisciplinary education, the symposium examined “embodied knowledge”—the habitual motion patterns of a culture, from how we dance to how we sit and walk—and the cultural effects of the African Diaspora.
For much of March 26, panels held in the lecture hall drew together interrelated cultural elements of the Diaspora—the term given to the outward global migration of Africans from the Continent. “[The symposium is] bringing together people whose strengths lie in different areas, but we’re all interested in processes where music is present and being physically articulated. We’re figuring out what’s vital in these processes—and it’s not going to fit in just one discipline,” said GSAS Music doctoral student Corinna S. Campbell, who also helped organize the symposium.
Harvard professors and graduate students convened with roughly 20 visiting professors and artists, and read papers for events titled “Embodied Knowledge,” “Bodies in Time: Synchrony in Music and Dance,” and “African Dance: Migration and Cultural Transmission.”
For Foster and Kivenko, it was essential to integrate performance and art into the symposium. March 25 brought McAlister and Nicolas to the stage, as well as filmmaker Alla Kovgan for a screening and roundtable discussion of her experimental documentary “Nora.” On the night of March 26, music group Uhuru Afrika turned the Cambridge Queen’s Head into an African dance celebration.
Closest to the event’s ethic, interspersed dance classes pulled spectators from their seats and allowed them to physically channel the art forms they had been hearing described. A master class from acclaimed dance company director Ronald K. Brown explored dance on March 26, as did a dance workshop offered by Florida State University dance professor Jawole Willa Jo Zollar called “How We Got to the Funk.”  Yale Theater Studies lecturer Lacina Coulibaly and Boston-based drummer and choreographer Sidi Mohammed “Joh” Camara also brought movement and history to those of all skill levels. Participants danced the popular 1960s dance move Mashed Potato and the traditional and contemporary styles of African Mande dance in the middle of the lecture hall stage, where they grooved to West African rhythms and James Brown.
“We really [wanted] to offer this to the public at large, as an opportunity to not only sit and watch, but also to really learn about a part of the world and an important cultural space through their bodies,” Kivenko said.
“The symposium provides integration across disciplines, and it’s also trying to do away with these superficial body-mind splits,” Campbell said.
Foster and Kivenko, as well as Interim Dean of Arts and Humanities Ingrid Monson, first envisioned this symposium several years ago after working in Africa. This year, everything fell into place, and they were finally able to host the event. Four graduate students returned from field work in centers of Diaspora culture, and the Department of Education awarded the Committee on African Studies a Title 6 grant of $2.5 million.
Though the symposium has barely finished, Foster is already looking to the future. “This symposium at Harvard follows other such gatherings on African Diaspora dance,” she said in her opening remarks at the start of the conference. “Do we dare hope for an annual gathering on this topic?”
Like Foster, Director of the Office of the Arts Jack C. Megan is enthusiastic about hosting this type of event in the years ahead. “I think this is a model for the deeper kind of collaboration we can undertake,” Megan said. “As Harvard strengthens its commitment to arts practice, there is the increased possibility for innovation and exploration in new ways.”

“I’ll come back to you in a year or so / And I’ll rebuild, ready to become / The person you believed in.”  It’s been a little longer than a year since Charlie Fink, lead singer of British indie band Noah and the Whale, forecast his triumphant return from post-break-up breakdowns, and he fulfills his promise in striking form on the band’s latest album. On “Last Night On Earth,” Fink turns his eyes up from his navel and onto the lives of carefully constructed characters longing to break free from limited existences. He depicts his characters with care, and, in setting them on the boundaries of freedom and their old lives, creates blissful portraits of longing and unbounded joy which his band builds into irresistible, if occasionally trite, pop songs.
Fink and his bandmates have traded the heavy drums, dusty guitars and dolorous vocals of their last album for light-footed drum machines, bright synths, and slightly less dolorous vocals of “Last Night on Earth.” Fink can sound down on his luck even when delivering a corny line like “Tonight’s the kind of night when everything could change,” but the darkness of his delivery contrasts with the uplift of the melodies to provide an undercurrent of receding pain to every hopeful tale of change. “Life is Life” builds from synthesizers reminiscent of The Who into anthemic cries of “He’s gonna change / Gonna change his ways” over the throb of a bass synth.
The band’s new taste for anthems is prevalent throughout the album. On their lead single, Noah and the Whale demonstrated an astute knowledge of popular music: no chorus is catchier than one with spelt lyrics. Yes, the infectious refrain of “L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.” would have made Fergie proud, even if it isn’t shorthand for a bizarre sex act. Before the band joins together to sing the refrain over the outro’s sinuous, sustained guitar, Fink sings, “On my last night on earth / I pay a high price / To have no regrets and be done with my life” again situating the pop abandon of a truly masterful song at a boundary of loss and potential. This lyrical and musical move of glancing backwards to refresh in the listener’s mind a source of tension before delivering a powerful release serves to imbue the songs with true depths of emotion.
Unfortunately, all the talk of boundaries occasionally seeps into the band’s music. Songs like “Waiting For My Chance to Come” reach for similar heights of hope and easy excitement as “L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.,” supporting lines like “I’m just waiting for my chance to come” with twelve-string guitar, the steady pulse of shifting power chords and warm dollops of Fender Rhodes redolent of Tom Petty. Though pleasant, the song feels limited and frustrated, as if it wants to be let loose but is somehow trapped by the band’s preoccupations. The group falls prey to contrivance again on “Give It All Back” whose cloying xylophone chords cast the song’s nostalgia as immature longing.
Not surprisingly, then, the album succeeds most stunningly on the slower numbers that deal more directly with themes of uncertainty and reflection than with abandoned freedom. “The Line,” easily the album’s best track, begins with a quavering bed of synthesizers and slow drum machine before tightly wound guitars and bass launch it into a strutting yet gentle beat which delicately contrasts with Fink’s timid delivery. The chorus releases all of the build of the verse in a gently cathartic chord pattern driven by a thrumming synthesizer and Fink’s portrait of a struggling relationship. The song’s most beautiful lyric provides, as many of the best on the album do, an intimate glimpse of a character reaching her boundaries: “She fixes her make-up / Treading lightly on the floor / Hoping he won’t wake up / As she makes her way towards the door.” The intricate rhymes are soothingly delivered over a mournfully cracked violin, and the song is a delicate and brooding pop masterpiece that reaches heights of poignancy at which their heavy-handed previous release only gestured.
At its best, “Last Night On Earth” is an unexpected and triumphant celebration that refuses to forget the very conditions that can make triumph seem so unexpected. Though the band’s preoccupations can restrain them to sounding trite when they mean to sound reckless and liberated, their nuanced exploration of the space between the pain of loss and the joy of moving on is adeptly serviced by their irresistible musicianship and their commitment to rebuilding, staying hopeful, and encompassing all of those feelings in the ever-prevalent medium of pop music.

Ironically, the Swedish indie rock trio Peter Bjorn and John titled their most successful album “Writer’s Block.” Perhaps they should have reserved that title for this album. Still riding on the success of their mega hit “Young Folks,” the band has released a new album, “Gimme Some,” which essentially spends forty minutes attempting to recapture the joyous essence of that 2006 hit. By trying too hard to channel the simplistic brilliance of “Young Folks” the trio creates a collection of songs, which when taken individually are successful and catchy, but when taken as a whole create a monotonous, repetitive, and wholly average experience.
The album shows potential in the early stretch with three relatively interesting and catchy songs: “Tomorrow Has To Wait,” “Dig A Little Deeper,” and “Second Chance.” However, the qualities that make these first three songs succeed—driving and syncopated drumbeats, ascending guitar riffs, and mimicking background vocals—begin to reappear in every song afterwards, and the distinctiveness of each one diminishes.  In fact, the band appears to be so adamantly avoiding variety that the first eight songs are all nearly identical in tempo, instrumentation, and drumbeat. The slow, laid-back yet self-accusatory ninth-track, “Down Like Me,” offers a glimmer of hope that variety may finally appear, but the reemergence of the album’s derivative style in the last two songs quickly dismisses this.
An uneasy sense of creative laziness pervades the album as a result of this dearth of diversity. “Gimme Some,” on the whole,  lacks the strokes of original genius like the whistled riff of “Young Folks.” Although similarly novel ideas appear throughout the album in the form of sequences like the distorted guitar solo that closes out the frenetic “Eyes,” and the soft airy string arrangement that opens “May Seem Macabre,” such moments are too infrequent to redeem the album’s general banality.
While the album as a whole is bland, the songs, when taken isolation, are well-crafted and exciting. These songs exemplify the gift the trio has for writing melodies that effortlessly and beautifully soar. Such melodic talent is most evident on the album’s standout tracks, “Tomorrow Has To Wait” and “I Know You Don’t Love me.” However, the band does not seem to be stretching themselves to apply their talents in ways that will enhance their music’s artistic merit. On “Second Chance” the band chants that you “Can’t can’t count on a second chance,” yet hypocritically all they seem to be doing by fleeing the experimentation of their previous, critically panned album, “Living Thing,” and returning to their old style is hoping for one.
“Gimme Some” shows what the trio can create when they are merely falling back on their strengths—a pop-rock sound rife with basic, catchy chord progressions, and beautifully constructed melodies—and exploring nothing new. The trio’s previous album, “Living Thing,” was considered too experimental and dissonant, and critics urged the band to focus on doing what they do best—writing catchy and hook filled pop rock tunes. But these critics were suggesting that the band confine their talents to a superficial level. In “Gimme Some” the trio could have combined their past experimental attempts with their vast melodic talents to create a truly great album.
On “Dig a Little Deeper” the trio urges their listeners to search more deeply when exploring music tastes and to avoid the superficiality of most contemporary music. Perhaps if they had listened to their own advice and delved past the surface layer that confines nearly all of the songs on the album to being weak attempts at the glory of “Young Folks,” “Gimme Some” might have finally removed the trio’s omnipresent and demeaning ‘one hit wonder’ label.

If there were ever any fears that Britney Spears would return to infamy as opposed to fame on her latest album, the album cover which shows her running her fingers through what is decidedly not a shaved head surely assuages them. In light of Spears’s recent and vigorous comeback, “Femme Fatale” is accurately named. Spears plays this character of “a dangerously attractive woman” on every track—whether its subject is dancing at a club or breakup sex—and the results are generally appealing. The album is comprised almost entirely of electronic dance music, but within that genre, the pop icon proves successful yet again at refracting current mainstream trends through a style undeniably her own.
Spears’ music has always shifted to reflect popular styles, but it consistently shows her distinctive touch—for example, “Baby One More Time” demonstrated an innocent and punchy aesthetic common to the boy-band era, just as “Femme Fatale” marks Spears’ entrance into the digital world of 2011’s club music. Some pieces seem generic, like “Till the World Ends,” the beat of which is suspiciously similar to Enrique Iglesias’ “Tonight (I’m Loving You),” but in others, Spears proves that she can do better than copying the now mole-less pop star. On “(Drop Dead) Beautiful,” she comically sings, “I will play whatever just to get a better view / And yeah your body looks so sick I think I caught the flu.” It may sound like a bad pickup line, but this quirky humor is another defining characteristic of Spears’ music that she has successfully incorporated into a multitude of new styles.
“How I Roll” perhaps best exemplifies Spears’ willingness to try out different genres. The track’s tinny drum machines, digitized harmonies and chipper synths resemble outlandish, indie pop more than they do typical club beats. While it may seem like a misguided attempt for a pop icon to emulate alternative music on a club album, the infectious idiosyncrasies of “How I Roll” show that—for Britney—the risk pays off.
As is unfortunately typical of Spears, the lyrics—and especially those that attempt storytelling—are strikingly juvenile, even for club music. “Criminal” seems eerily immature for the 29-year-old star: the song’s narrator, who has fallen in love with a miscreant, tells her mother not to cry, and she attempts to console her with the misguided explanation that “This type of love isn’t rational / It’s physical.” This alone would be acceptable, but the line stating that he has a tattoo of her name on his arm and therefore must really care about her leads one to wonder how much Spears has really grown up in the decade-and-a-half of her stardom. However, lyrics aside, the chorus is one of the catchiest on the album.
Two of the songs feature guest artists: “(Drop Dead) Beautiful” features the little-known Sabi and “Big Fat Bass” showcases Will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas. Both tracks possess desk-shaking bass beats and irresistible choruses. The music is club and radio ready, and every song on this album will almost certainly be on party and pre-game playlists on campuses across the states in the near future.
As evidenced by Spears’ renewed irresistible vigor on “Femme Fatale” as well as her appearance on the hit show “Glee,” she is not yet ready to leave the spotlight. The artist has an uncanny ability to bend and mold to fit whatever genre of music is popular at any time while still maintaining her always recognizable sound. The tracks on “Femme Fatale” may not be wildly original, but they’re doubtlessly fun to listen to. Though predictable, the album is a job well done for a talented artist who has already experienced a lifetime’s worth of limelight.

If their breathtaking second LP, “Belong,” is any indication, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart are growing up rapidly. In 2009, the young band seared their image onto hipster consciousness with their self-titled debut, a record that sounded as classic as its own cover art looked. The album was a perfect cut of early 90’s indie—the band’s sound inspired by the twee fuzz of bands like Black Tambourine, and hearkening back to the darker, dreamy haze of shoe-gaze monolith My Bloody Valentine. On their new album, The Pains fulfill all the promise of their past work and reveal an inspired and expanded dimension in their sound and song-writing capacity.
The band’s rapid evolution is best suggested by the insistently slinky and propulsive single, “Heart In Your Heartbreak.” Lacking their typical distortion, the song sounds organic as well as expressive, and contains a sweet and lilting chorus that deceptively adorns the song’s theme of utterly crushing and irreversible heartache: “Still your friends don’t understand / That the world could end and it’d feel no worse than this.” The interplay between the dynamic instrumentals and compelling lyrics reveals a more carefully crafted sound than their last album.
The sharpness and subtlety in “Heartbreak” point to a poeticism that courses through the “Belong.” Lead singer Kip Berman’s airy voice is less masked by the guitars, and his lyrics are populated with compellingly warm characters, locations, and images. Similar to “Devotion” by Beach House, “Belong” explores the single word concept of its title. Through a core theme of belonging and alienation, the songs here also reach conceptually for reconciliation, dedication and devotion—the forms of love and solidarity shared by the downtrodden.
The title-track “Belong” opens the album and sets this agenda powerfully, with Berman delivering the embittered lines: “I know / It’s wrong  / But we / Just don’t belong.” Musically, the song is a revelation for The Pains. With its bombastically brooding guitar riffs and anthemic scope, the song plays like a manifesto for all the lost and weird. The track’s placement is even a little jarring, as it practically causes the album to climax on the first track. Yet that role is reserved for the gorgeous height of “Even In Dreams,” an even more resonant song that contains a statement of devastatingly pure and simple commitment:  “Even in dreams, I could not betray you.”
Besides a handful of songs, “Belong” largely sheds the gauzy distortion of the band’s former works. Though the heavy crunch of the first ten of seconds of “Belong” might suggest The Smashing Pumpkins as an influence, the conjecture is partially misleading. The sound is like The Pumpkins, but largely more along the lines of “1979” and “Tonight, Tonight.” This time around the guitars shimmer instead of crackle, and the flourishes of keyboard player Peggy Wang have become a much more prominent backbone. In fact, the ebullient disco-synth and fat snare drum on songs like “The Body” and “My Terrible Friend”, seem to have more in common with other older bands such as Pulp, New Order, or even the Cure.
Though thematically coherent and compelling, the album stagnates a bit towards the end. The band’s debut flowed perfectly with Spartan editing and a careful pace. Where that record staved off redundancy by introducing some tempo changes in its last songs, “Belong” falters slightly with the inclusion of some weaker and uninspired cuts. For example, the song “Girl of 1,000 Dreams” begins promisingly with vengeful distortion and vicious toms otherwise absent on the rest of the album. Yet the syrupy verses that follow are awkward, and they seem like the work of a different band. The song isn’t exactly a failed attempt, nor is it unpleasant, but it does feel out of place at the end of the album.
Ultimately, though, the second half is redeemed on the gorgeous rush of the band’s tremendous final song, “Dreams.” The instruments play the album out, receding slowly in volume. Commencing with an unaccompanied dance drumbeat and moving into an iridescent stream of guitar, the song fades slowly, as if begging for the album to be played again.
Perhaps it makes sense that The Pains of Being Pure At Heart should be so constantly mentioned in the same breath as so many classic post-punk bands of decades past. After listening to “Belong,” it is hard to conceive of a better heir to these classic artists. But The Pains push forward too, having created an incredible and exciting record that will move them past mere genre recognitions. “Belong” is beautiful and even touching—a sonic and emotional kaleidoscope of loves lost and loves realized.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 2008 study on university campuses found that a whopping 87 percent of "emerging" adult men (aged 18-26), and 31 percent of emerging adult women report using porn at some level. Twenty percent of young men report using pornography daily or every other day, and almost half use it at least weekly. But the shock factor of pornography consumption statistics do not stop there: The sky is blue and men view porn—we’ve lost the shock value in our passive acceptance. Perhaps the more telling pornography statistic is that slightly over two thirds of young men, and nearly half of young women believe that porn consumption is morally acceptable.
This statistic of acceptance is particularly interesting because it is pulled from our generation, which often defines right and wrong in terms of consequences. Consequence-based morality maintains that if something doesn’t hurt yourself or others, it’s not wrong. The principle of “Thou shalt not hurt” thus becomes the backbone of discursive moral reasoning, as observed by the National Study of Youth and Religion. Removing an external moral standard from moral reasoning makes it difficult to condemn sex trafficking, exploitation, and violence, much less explicit sexual content and nudity. But even in terms of a “Thou shalt not hurt” moral code, passively accepting pornography overlooks the very real consequences of porn consumption.
Healthy sexuality combines emotional, social, intellectual, and physical elements, but pornography separates the mechanized components of intercourse from real sexuality itself. It leads to decreased sensitivity toward women and increased aggression. It also leads to a decreased ability to build healthy relationships or experience sexual satisfaction; users are increasingly unable to properly link emotional involvement with sex. Indeed, porn fosters incredibly unhealthy views about sexuality and human beings. Most porn portrays women as sex-obsessed, mindless objects, promiscuous and subordinate. As feminist scholar Catharine MacKinnon might propose, the prevalence of pornography begs the question: Are women human? Though that question seems extreme, ask yourself if a good society can intentionally engage in a medium that portrays half of its members in such a derogatory manner.
There is much discussion on how the government should regulate the big business of pornography, seesawing between freewheeling libertarianism and heavy-handed censorship.
Indeed, we are increasingly desensitized to discussion about porn use and regulation, even as research proves the effects of pornography are life altering, and stories of sex exploitation, psychological problems, and abuse dominate inspections into the porn industry. Many Americans embrace fair-trade coffee, concerned about the industries that produce their goods, but few consumers express concern about porn industry operations, and its employees and victims.
Even by the often-cited moral standards of individual choice and “Thou shalt not hurt,” the porn discussion demands our moral attention. Recent work by neurologists illustrates the very real addictive properties of pornography. Porn addictions restrict real individual choice. University of Texas-San Antonio’s Dr. Donald L. Hilton, Jr.’s research on porn addiction explains that pleasure chemicals in the brain are gradually overused when a person views pornography; the brain then limits dopamine production, causing the viewer to become starved for dopamine.
Despite the personal and social costs of pornography, health services are absurdly silent on the issue of such an exploitative and harmful industry. Harvard’s University Health Services and Office of Sexual Prevention and Response dance around the issue without offering services or information to students about porn consumption and addiction. OSAPR refused the requests of True Love Revolution officers to assist with the White Ribbon Against Pornography Week without citing any reasons. OSAPR should make a concerted effort to reach out to students who are struggling with porn and educate students on the harmful effects of pornography. University offices shy away from addressing the porn issue as a tangible part of students’ personal lives; they instead turn it into a vague, elusive matter.
Perhaps the University avoids the porn issue in order to avoid moral or social controversy, but fear of stirring up debate does few favors for students who struggle with porn consumption. University of Chicago professor Jean Bethke Elshtain argues in The Social Costs of Pornography that we should not dismiss the “moral” in our avoidance of the “moralistic.” Elshtain maintains that in order to be responsible citizens, we must ask ourselves, “What sort of community is this? Is it reasonably decent and kind? Is it a fit place for human habitation, especially for the young? What happens to the most vulnerable among us? How do we ill-dignify the human body, and how do we forestall such affronts?” Such questions demand long-winded, nuanced answers, yet it is worth seeking these answers. They are pertinent to those who are involved in the porn industry, and they are pertinent to our own lives. We should all be asking ourselves whether pornography is compatible with a respectful and good society.

Just a little over a year ago, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. The law enacts significant health insurance reforms that will take effect over the next several years. But one very important piece of that law is already in place.  And it may directly benefit you.
The Affordable Care Act ensures that college students and young adults can stay on their parents’ employer-provided health care plans until age 26.  Before, many health plans and issuers dropped young adults from their parents’ policies because of their age. That left countless college students, recent college graduates and other young people with little recourse, and worse: no health insurance.  Historically, some 30 percent of young adults have been uninsured, a rate far higher than that of any other age group
But young people don’t need health insurance, right?  The statistics say otherwise: One-in-six young adults today is faced with a chronic illness such as cancer, diabetes or asthma. And nearly half of uninsured young adults report problems paying medical bills.
The new law ensures you have an option when it comes to your health care. This is important as you continue through school, and as you transition into the job market, since you may find that health care coverage is not immediately available through your employer.  Or you may work part time. You may choose to continue your education and go to graduate school, or take time off to travel and pursue volunteer opportunities.
It allows you to remain on your parents’ plan, or rejoin it until age 26, even if you no longer live with your parents, are not a dependent on their tax return or are no longer a student. The new flexibility even applies if you are married.  You are guaranteed the same benefits and at the same price that is available to other dependents.
More health care improvements are on the way—and many may also directly benefit you. Already, coverage cannot be denied for those under age 19 because of a pre-existing condition.  By 2014, denying coverage to anyone based on a pre-existing condition will be banned.  Annual dollar caps on care, which are already limited, will be prohibited; and state-based health insurance exchanges will create a new marketplace, giving more employers and millions of Americans the ability to purchase affordable coverage.
The Affordable Care Act is based on the simple belief that every American--and that includes college students—deserves access to high-quality, affordable health care.  One year after it has become law, that belief is becoming reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little over a week ago, Harvard junior Alexander B. Heffner ’12 published an opinion piece in the U.S. News and World Report arguing that the Harvard experience is “overrated” and intellectually unsatisfying. This article is just the latest in a series of works by Harvard graduates that market themselves by allegedly exposing the fallacy of Harvard’s superiority—written in the vein of Ross G. Douthat’s ’02 memoir, Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class and R. Nick McDonnell’s ’07 fiction work, An Expensive Education.
While the existence of this new genre is not itself disconcerting, the purpose it serves is. Alumni and current students have an obligation to provide honest feedback on their experience to both the College and its prospective students. However, one would hope that this feedback originates with selfless intentions and carries over into a careful and constructive analysis of the situation. Too often, this genre of work falls short in its self-serving and hypocritical presentation and its failure to provide any sort of constructive criticism.
Furthermore, in publishing these works, the authors make use of the same brand-name benefits that they often find to be the greatest fault within the institution. In his work, Heffner laments the College’s “formula for undergraduate prestige” and the distorting effect it has on students’ incentive to attend the school. However, it is doubtful whether Heffner’s piece would have even earned a spot in a national publication without its ostentatious use of the Harvard name. It is telling that Heffner chooses to make his association with the school clear within the title of his piece, “A Harvard Education Isn’t As Advertised.”
In fact, perhaps the strongest case that can be raised against Heffner’s piece and the anti-Harvard genre is that past works have already made the same argument in better ways. Former Yale Professor’s William Deresiewicz’s piece in The American Scholar, “The Disadvantages of an Elite Education” is an excellent example, making all of the points outlined in Heffner’s op-ed but with more developed arguments and less emphasis on name-dropping. Unlike Heffner, Deresiewicz makes no mention of specific institutions or his association with them until the second paragraph of his piece and then only as a means of validating his argument.
On a rather different note, the recently published “I Am Fine” made a more personal, less institutional criticism of Harvard’s general atmosphere but managed to do so in the most appropriate way. The anonymity of the author was one of the most striking aspects of the piece, conveying a sincere desire to bring forward an issue rather than to push forward an agenda. In addition, the decision to publish “I Am Fine” in a campus publication rather than an outside publication, made the issue relevant to those it actually concerned: the students. Heffner would do well to take lessons from these two pieces regarding intentionality and appropriateness in order to better present his argument.
In fact, if the intention behind Heffner’s piece were to affect the impersonal and anti-intellectual atmosphere of the school, it would have been better carried out through a variety of different methods. There are a number of institutions designed to deal with undergraduate concerns, among them the Undergraduate Council and the individual House Committees.
Similarly, many academic departments and committees at Harvard have some form of student representation for bringing concerns to faculty members and facilitating interaction between the two. The considerable presence of opportunities for voicing dissent on campus makes Heffner’s choice of a national publication to inspire campus-wide changes particularly questionable.
In this same line, although we are among the biggest critics of College academic life, we take issue with Heffner’s characterization of our academic resources. Harvard’s lack of student-faculty interaction is a frequently discussed issue but one that has inspired action in addition to argument. In response, the College has created events like the student-faculty dinners and requirements for all professors teaching undergraduates to hold at least one hour of office hours a week. In fact, one of the mostly widely cited reasons for poor student-faculty relationships is the unwillingness of students to take advantage of such resources. As an academic institution, the most Harvard can do is provide students the opportunity to make use of faculty resources. In many ways, it is the students’ responsibility to take advantage of these resources.
Last but not least, that many readers may perceive Heffner to represent the opinions of all seven thousand Harvard undergraduates through his own individual experience is unfortunate. “As any undergraduate who actually attends the school knows, the Harvard education is overrated,” Heffner writes, at one point. Heffner’s argument is not only weakened by his tendency to resort to personal anecdotes and over-generalizing statements, it is absolutely delegitimized.
The phenomenon of Harvard students complaining about Harvard is nothing new or groundbreaking. In the course of things, Heffner’s piece represents nothing more than another addition to an established genre of works. While well-placed, well-meaning criticism can often have important institutional impacts, this particular piece is neither accurate nor constructive. Those who truly care about this University seek to launch change in different ways.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court released its most controversial decision of the term, ruling that protests at military funerals were protected under the First Amendment’s freedom of speech clause. In Snyder v. Phelps, the Court was asked to rule on the constitutionality of a fine imposed on the Westboro Baptist Church for the “intentional infliction of emotional distress” while protesting at Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder’s funeral. According to the Court, the fine overstepped constitutional bounds by punishing speech protected by the First Amendment. Nonetheless, the Court’s opinion overlooks two crucial distinctions. First, it overlooks the difference between restrictions on freedom of speech and restrictions on the how, when, and where of speech. Second, it overlooks the difference between possessing rights and exercising them.
In this case, the Court determined that fining the Westboro  Baptist Church would amount to punishment for exercising its legitimate First Amendment rights. However, the Court failed to acknowledge that the location and timing of particular forms of speech can be restricted without infringing on freedom of speech itself. The fine was not meant to punish the Westboro Baptist  Church for the content of its message—which was anti-homosexual in nature—but for choosing to express that message in an inappropriate context, when a family was attempting to privately mourn its loss. Imposing a fine does not suggest that the Church cannot express its viewpoints, simply that it can’t do so at certain times and places—in this case, at a military funeral.
An even more crucial distinction relates to the difference between possessing rights and exercising them—the difference between freedom and sensitivity. Undoubtedly, the Westboro Baptist  Church has a constitutional right to express its views; however, when it expressed those views in an insensitive way, it became liable for the consequences of its actions—in this case, the intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Church’s actions could clearly have caused emotional harm to Snyder’s family; in an online post published the day after the protest, the Church addressed the fallen Marine’s parents, saying that “[T]hey sent [Matthew] to fight for the United States of Sodom, a filthy country that is in lock step with his evil, wicked, and sinful manner of life. … How dumb was that?” The post also included attacks on Snyder’s involvement in the “largest pedophile machine in the history of the entire world, the Roman Catholic monstrosity.”
These personal attacks on a service member overstep all bounds, especially moral. By choosing to protest at Snyder’s funeral—by choosing to verbally brutalize his mourners and his memory—the Westboro  Baptist Church intentionally inflicted harm on his family. Even if the organization had the constitutional right to engage in its vicious assault, members shouldn’t have exercised this right in an insensitive way; when they did, they exposed themselves to charges of intentional infliction of emotional harm, a just consequence of their disrespectful acts. Instead of elevating the Church’s freedom of speech rights at the expense of all other claims, the Court should have recognized that the Marine family’s deserves to mourn its loss in peace. That right went unprotected by the justices’ casual elevation of insensitive and personally hurtful speech.
With the rights guaranteed by the Constitution come obligations. If Americans are worthy of these rights, they need to employ them responsibly, recognizing that the possession of a right doesn’t always justify its unrestricted exercise. The Westboro Baptist protestors didn’t do so, and as a result, they should have been subject to the just fine that the Supreme Court excused them from paying.

The Harvard women’s lacrosse team executed so well during its 19-3 dismantling of Yale on Saturday afternoon at Harvard Stadium that labeling the game film a highlight reel would be an understatement.
Two sophomores, midfielder Danielle Tetreault and attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen, led the offense with four goals each, while the Crimson (3-3, 2-1 Ivy) defense hounded the Bulldogs (1-7, 0-3), resulting in Harvard’s largest win in more than two seasons.
“I thought we played well from the beginning,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said. “We played really well as a team with a lot of energy and a lot of excitement.”
Harvard drew first blood just a little over two minutes into the game when junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind scored the Crimson’s initial goal off a free-position shot. VanderMeulen and junior attacker Jess Halpern soon followed suit with a goal each, giving Harvard a promising start to its rivalry matchup.
Yale showed brief signs of life after the Crimson’s 3-0 lead grew to 7-1, with attackers Caroline Crow and Jen DeVito scoring once each to cut Harvard’s lead to four, 7-3.
But the Crimson’s defense held strong from there, shutting its opponent out for the final 39 minutes of play.
Harvard freshman attacker Jenn Leffew scored her first goal of the game to counter the Bulldogs’ fleeting surge. From there, the Crimson scored two more unanswered goals to close out the first half, with the latter coming right at the buzzer from junior tri-captain Tyler Petropulos.
Coming out of the break, Harvard showed no signs of letting up, with Tetreault scoring her third goal of the game less than a minute into the period. Meanwhile, the Crimson’s defense continued to hold strong.
“I’m really happy with the defense’s performance,” junior defender Ellen Gleason said. “The defense really operates as a unit. We kind of feed off of each other. The help defense, slides, and on-ball defense were all there.”
“I thought [the defense] played great,” Miller added. “We had to absorb an injury [to sophomore midfielder Micaela Cyr]. We had to figure out how to do that. I thought the team stepped up to fill in all the things that she was good at. I was really happy about how they came together.”
By swarming loose balls and with junior goalie Kerry Clark standing strong in net, Harvard’s defense was able to completely shut down Yale’s offense, keeping the visitors scoreless for the entire second half.
“Kerry’s been having a great year,” Tetreault said. “Last year, Yale came up and we had a tough loss to them. This year Kerry stepped up. She’s stepping up in the crease, getting those low angle shots. She’s doing great.”
Given the sheer amount of opportunities created by the defense for quick counterattacks, the Crimson was surprisingly patient on the offensive end, often settling down and spacing out around the Bulldog’s 12-meter fan to distribute the ball and wait for the best shot.
“We’re a young team, but we’re playing with more maturity this year,” Tetreault said. “And if we can keep playing and waiting for those smart shots, we’re going to put the ball away. We just have to wait and be patient.”
The win also gave freshman players an opportunity to showcase their talents.
“We had three freshman starting on defense,” Gleason said. “And a couple more came in today who just played stellar. They don’t play like freshmen either, which is huge, because it’s tough to just come in with no college experience.”
“I was really happy to see a lot of kids who haven’t been getting a lot of playing time in those really tight games come in and not miss a beat,” Miller added. “Hopefully, this is the way it’s supposed to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In last weekend’s twinbill against Bryant, the Harvard softball team grabbed a 7-0 lead in its second matchup of the day before officials called the game due to a lack of light. Unable to avenge its 6-3 loss from its earlier game, the Crimson left Rhode Island angry and frustrated.
Harvard took that frustration and unleashed it on the Quinnipiac Bobcats (16-13) and the Iona College Gaels (7-11) in consecutive doubleheaders on Saturday and Sunday, respectively.  The Crimson (12-10) went 3-1 over the weekend with a sweep against Quinnipiac—including a shutout—and a split series against the Iona. Harvard outscored its opponents, 22-13, highlighted by junior Mari Zumbro’s grand slam against Iona.
In its final weekend before Ivy League conference matchups, all of which are two back-to-back doubleheaders, the Crimson understood the importance of using Quinnipiac and Iona to get into a proper rhythm before starting conference play.
“This is one of the most important weekends for us as a team,” co-captain Ellen Macadam said. “The teams we play here are much more similar in caliber to the teams we’ll be playing in the Ivies. So it’s good to be able to get everything firing and working before we open conference [play].”
IONA 8, HARVARD 3
In Harvard’s last game of the weekend, the Crimson kept things close by overcoming a 3-1 deficit to tie the game at three by the end of the third inning. But the Gaels scored five unanswered runs over the next three innings to take the 8-3 victory.
“The fourth game is always the toughest,” junior pitcher Rachel Brown said. “To play four games in a weekend is not easy. We didn’t quite have our usual energy.”
Harvard struck first with freshman infielder Kasey Lange hitting a double to bring home Macadam and give the Crimson a 1-0 lead. But Iona responded, scoring three runs in the bottom of the second, as Harvard struggled with the Gaels’ pitching.
“We needed to attack their pitcher a little more,” Macadam said. “We were a little slow in adjusting to their pitcher.”
The Crimson faced one of the toughest pitching staffs of the year as Iona senior pitcher Alyssa Maiese struck out nine batters in Harvard’s loss.
“We faced one of the best pitching teams we’ve seen all season,” Brown said. “For our offense to score seven runs in two games was great.”
HARVARD 4, IONA 1
Earlier in the day, both teams remained scoreless until the top of the seventh inning, when Harvard pitcher Zumbro pounded the ball out of Iona’s Rice Oval Park for a grand slam to put the Crimson up, 4-0.
“It was a really close game,” Macadam said. “Kind of a pitcher’s duel. With two outs, we loaded the bases, and then Mari came in and hit a grand slam for us. It was unbelievably great.”
Brown struck out 15 of the 26 batters she faced, allowing only one run at the bottom of the seventh.
“We had great defense,” Brown said. “I was confident that every time a runner got on, my defense could make the plays. It was just a matter of when we could score.”
HARVARD 7, QUINNIPIAC 4
Harvard scored first and often in its second game against Quinnipiac. In the third inning, Macadam doubled off of an error and brought in junior infielder Jane Alexander. Later in the fifth, the Crimson blew the game open, scoring five more runs.
“We really came to play,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We brought good energy to the games today. Offensively, we really settled in, swung at some good pitches, and made things happen. Jane Alexander had an exceptional day at plate, and we had a lot of clutch hits.”
Alexander added to her single in the third inning with a double in the fifth, while freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone and Zumbro helped the visiting team hold its lead down the stretch.
“Our pitchers did an amazing job of keeping us in it,” Alexander said. “Everyone just swung their bats like they were capable of, and we came together to put a bunch of runs on the board.”
HARVARD 8, QUINNIPIAC 0
Giving up a sole leadoff single at the bottom of the fourth and striking out 10 of the 23 batters she faced, Brown recorded her second one-hit shutout of the season in the Crimson’s first game against the Bobcats.
While Quinnipiac was unable to get anything past Brown, the Crimson scored twice in the fourth inning, followed by six runs in the seventh. Alexander and Lange each homered once in the final inning to lift Harvard to its 8-0 win.
“It was good to see our offense come together in full force,” Macadam said. “We’ve been getting a lot of runners on base in the past few games, but we haven’t had much success in scoring. So, I think we finally broke through today and scored a couple of runs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Finishing off a tough road trip this weekend against the New York Institute of Technology (3-11, 0-0 ECC), the Harvard baseball team (3-15, 0-0 Ivy) split the four-game series with the Bears. Starting pitchers highlighted the team’s .500 weekend record, giving up only five earned runs in 22 innings.
“We’re a little disappointed,” junior pitcher Brent Suter said. “We wanted to do more than just split the series…We had two games slip away from us, but we feel confident to play Holy Cross [on Wednesday] and get the Ivy League season underway.”
Statistically, the defense also played better than in previous games this season, committing fewer errors, but the team made mistakes at critical moments to allow the games to slip away.
“We were hoping to win the four-game series, but at the same time there were a lot of positives that came out of the weekend,” senior pitcher Zack Hofeld said. “Every year you want to head into Ivy play with the most momentum possible, and we’ve started playing better baseball…Our defense has been getting better, and the bats are starting to come around.”
NYIT 5, HARVARD 3
In its final game of the weekend, the Crimson could not rally back after going down, 4-0, in the third inning on two unearned runs by NYIT. The inning featured a lead-off error and a catcher’s interference that put Harvard in a deep hole.
Offensively, the Crimson scattered eight hits but was not able to sustain a rally until the top of the fifth. Senior shortstop Sean O’Hara had Harvard’s only RBI, singling in senior centerfielder Dillon O’Neill.
Junior second baseman Jeff Reynolds later scored on a wild pitch to bring the deficit to two, but the Bears—who later added another run in the sixth—held the Crimson to no runs in the final four frames of the game.
Harvard finished the game leaving a total of 10 men on base, while committing two official scorer’s errors.
HARVARD 3, NYIT 0
Sunday’s first game featured a pitcher’s duel that Suter won for the Crimson. The junior threw a seven-inning shutout in which he struck out nine and only allowed three Bear batters to reach base.
“I was focusing on spotting my fastball, keeping them guessing, and I kept getting good results,” Suter said. “But it was a total team effort as the team played strong defense behind me.”
The game was tied at zero until the top of the fifth, when Harvard rallied to score its only runs of the night. The three-run inning was capped off by an O’Hara single to left, plating O’Neill.
HARVARD 10, NYIT 6
In the night half of Saturday’s play, the Crimson capitalized on six errors by the Bears to get its second win of the season.
Senior pitcher Max Perlman earned his first win of the season, collecting six strikeouts in five innings, while allowing two earned runs. Senior pitcher Ben Sestanovich closed the game out getting his first save of the season, allowing one earned run in four innings.
Harvard took the lead in the first inning on junior first baseman Marcus Way’s RBI single and never relinquished it. Reynolds hit a two-RBI single in the top of the second to bring the lead to five.
The Crimson gave up three runs to NYIT in the bottom of the seventh, and the lead shrank to one, 7-6. Way struck again, adding another RBI single to close out the game, contributing to his 3-for-5 game with a homer and three RBIs.
NYIT 3, HARVARD 2
In the first game of the weekend, the Crimson dropped a close game in seven innings after a late error gave the Bears the third run they needed to cap off the game.
Senior pitcher Eric Eadington struck out eight in five innings while giving up just one earned run, but his five walks eventually allowed two baserunners to score.
After giving up a single in the bottom of the second, a balk and passed ball moved the runner to third, allowing NYIT to take the early lead on an RBI groundout.
Harvard came back in the top of the fourth on a two-RBI single by senior catcher Cole Arledge, accounting for the only runs of the night for the offense.
The Bears retaliated with a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the fifth and then took the lead that sealed the game on an unearned run in the bottom of the sixth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first race of the season, Harvard men’s lightweight crew did exactly what it set out to do: win.The Crimson won four of its five races against visiting Delaware. Only Harvard’s first freshman boat fell to the Blue Hens.“They showed up to race,” Crimson coach Charley Butt said of his crews. “They’d made their minds to be strong and to ignore the obvious shortcomings of the weather. It’s harder than it looks to go out there in those conditions. They rowed hard, and they rowed well. I think it’s a fine start to our season.” The first varsity eight set the tone for the day with its 11.1-second win in the teams’ first race.According to Butt, the Crimson reached the 1000-meter mark around four seconds ahead of the Blue Hens. Once Harvard went past Harvard Bridge into calmer water, it was able to open up the race and crossed the finish line in 6:36.1, a strong time in a cross-headwind listed as between 15 and 20 miles per hour.“The water was rougher at the beginning,” said captain Will Newell, who raced in the six-seat of the first varsity eight.”I think we definitely got comfortable [in the second 1000].”But Newell didn’t believe the weather had a huge affect on the results.“It does affect the times,” Newell said. “But at the end of the day, everyone’s dealing with the same weather. I don’t think you would see a different result if you’d had different weather.”After the first varsity eight won handily, the second varsity eight won by an even larger margin. The Crimson crossed the line in 6:45.5, nearly 20 seconds ahead of its Delaware counterpart. Harvard’s time was also faster than the 6:47.2 posted by the Blue Hens’ first varsity eight in the race just before.“I thought the second varsity had a particularly good race,” Butt said.The second varsity eight had secured open water earlier in the race than its first-boat counterparts.“They started to move away at 500 meters, and by the time they got to the 1000, they had open water,” freshman coach Linda Muri said. “They did a lot there in that first 1000.”The third time proved to be the charm for Delaware. In the third race of the day, the Blue Hens’ first freshman eight earned a five-second win over its Crimson counterparts.But Harvard was able to keep the race competitive in its early stages.“It was pretty close, within a couple of seats,” Muri said. “Delaware had a slight advantage of two to three seats. They’d be up two, they’d be up three, they’d be up two, they’d be up three...just before the 1000, our guys were able to close to back within a seat."But that was as close as the Crimson would get."Delaware was able to counter,” Muri continued.“In that second 1000, they got almost another length.”Harvard reasserted itself in the third varsity eight race, which the Crimson won by 16.7 seconds.The Blue Hens jumped out to an early lead, but Harvard was able to move through Delaware’s crew to take a narrow lead.The close margin turned into a quarter-minute win when the Blue Hens’ seven seat caught a boat-stopping crab.“They had some good momentum regardless,” Muri said of the 3v.“It took them a little longer,” Newell said. “They definitely had a good second half of the piece.” The final race of the day was the second freshman fours event in which the Crimson’s three fours of walk-ons took on the Blue Hens’ second freshman four entry.Harvard took the top two places, while Delaware took third, four seconds ahead of the Crimson’s third entry.Harvard’s A four finished the race in 8:21.4, 17.9 seconds ahead of its runner-up teammates. The real race was between the Crimson’s B four and the Blue Hens’ entry.“My second four got off to a slower start,” Muri said. “It was a good race. It was back and forth with my second four and Delaware.”The B four eventually won by 7.3 seconds, while the Blue Hens beat Harvard’s C four by four seconds.Saturday marked a strong start for a team that is seeking a return to the top of the national standings. The Crimson’s next test will come in two weeks when Harvard heads to the Schuylkill to take on Penn and Cornell.“This is our first chance...to have a first go down the course, to make weight for the first time, to race a 2k for the first time, to kind of see what’s working and what’s not,” Newell said. “You can’t argue with a win.”—Staff writer Christina C.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a four-game losing streak on the West Coast, the Crimson women’s water polo team (11-9, 2-2 Ivy) returned to winning form at home with a 12-8 victory over Wagner (11-8, 0-0 MAAC) yesterday at Blodgett Pool.
“We talked about using the lessons we learned in California,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “With those lessons, we can just keep getting better and apply those [lessons] into the game.”
The difference showed starting from the first face-off as the home team took the early lead, 2-0, on back-to-back goals from junior co-captain Devan Kennifer. The potential All-American finished the first period with five goals on her way to a six-goal game, in which she also had five steals. She now has a total 51 goals for this season.
“Devan is Devan,” Minnis said. “She was an All-American last year, and she’s going to get another look this year…she’s just really fun to watch play.”
With 5:30 left to play in the first period, the Seahawks responded with a goal from close range to close up the lead, 2-1. But Kennifer came right back, scoring another two goals in two minutes to increase the lead to three.
But Wagner kept the game within reach, stopping two Crimson offensive drives and adding two goals of their own to again bring the lead to one.
“I thought that was a real good game for us,” Kennifer said. “They really match up well with us, and we’ve had prior history with Wagner, so it was great to get such a strong win.”
Harvard closed the period, 6-3, by scoring two goals in the final minutes. Kennifer notched another goal, while junior Shannon Purcell scored her first of two goals.
The Crimson did not let up on either side of the ball as it entered the second period. The defense shut out the Seahawks in the period, contributing to Harvard’s 11th game this season in which it held its opponent to single-digit goals.
After three minutes of no scoring, the Crimson capitalized on a steal by junior Monica Zdrojewski, who swam her way to an easy goal on the breakaway. After Kennifer added her own goal on a lob shot over Wagner goalie Laura Karbach’s head, Purcell put it away with 25 seconds on the clock to give Harvard a 9-3 lead going into the half.
“The teams we played in California tended to be more physical and be at a higher level,” Kennifer said. “I think it gave us the opportunity to match that higher level and bring back those skills back to the East Coast, especially on defense.”
After an offensive lull by both teams on multiple missed shots, the Bears found the back of the net off a long pass by the Wagner goalie. With three and a half minutes left on the clock, Harvard earned a five-meter penalty shot, giving sophomore two-meter guard Elise Molnar a chance to extend the lead. Molnar converted on the opportunity on her way to a total of three goals and two steals.
The third period ended, 10-4, with the Crimson in position to control the game’s clock in the last period.
After losing the final face-off of the day, the Bears struck with a quick goal, but Molnar responded to again extend the lead to six.
“After a long week away, I think it was good to get a week of practice in,” Minnis said. “We had the time to focus on one team and one game, and it made the girls really fired up and focused on the challenge at hand and not what’s ahead.”
With a few minutes left in the game, Harvard began to run out the shot clock, eliminating the time Wagner would have for a comeback.
The Bears scored for the sixth time with three minutes to play and added two more goals in the final minutes, but could not put up enough shots to catch up.
With support from the defense, junior goalie Laurel McCarthy had eight saves en route to controlling the Wagner offense throughout much of the game.
The team combined for a total of 17 steals dispersed among eight players.
“On the road trip we learned how well we can play as a team,” Kennifer said. “And we just have to keep our energy up and just remember to play as hard as we can the rest of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing one match in one day is tiring for most teams.
The Harvard men’s tennis team (11-7), then, displayed extra grit by defeating two opponents within a span of only eight hours yesterday at the Murr Center.
“Often, if you want to get your guys who don’t get to play more match time, you play a doubleheader,” said Crimson coach Dave Fish ’72. “So, we held out and we figured out a strong enough lineup to beat Fairfield.”
The lineup change did not faze Harvard—it showed that the team is deep enough that any player can step up when called to play.
“I thought it was a good day,” Fish said. “We’re exhausted. I’m sure the players are, too. It’s served its purpose.”
These games were a good tune-up with Ivy League play beginning the upcoming Friday against Cornell, the highest ranked team in the division.
HARVARD 4, FAIRFIELD 3
After using a set of players in the first game, Fish changed up his lineup to put out enough force to defeat the weaker Stags (6-6).
“Against Fairfield, that was a pretty tough match,” sophomore Joshua Tchan said. “The rest of the team had to step up and take the challenge.”
After winning the doubles point, the Crimson faced off against the Stags in singles play.
The only athlete to play in both matches on Sunday was Tchan, who was able to finish off his opponent in two sets on court one.
“This was a great one because Josh Tchan played the six earlier and then the one here,” Fish said. “He played a very different match than he had played against the number six. Sometimes people play to a level. He was playing fairly conservatively in the morning. [This afternoon], he just went after it.”
In the matchup of the number threes, senior Alexei Chijoff-Evans easily disposed of his Fairfield opponent, 6-4, 6-3. Chjioff-Evans was able to frustrate his opponent with powerful shots that took his challenger off his game.
On court six, sophomore Tunc Kiymaz won his match, 6-2, 7-6. According to Fish, Kiymaz’s under-pressure forehand winner was crucial in Harvard’s victory over Fairfield.
With these three wins and the doubles point, the Crimson had finished victorious before the other three matches wrapped up.
Junior Mac McAnulty, freshman Brendan Seaver, and classmate John Thornton lost their matches soon afterward.
In McAnulty and Seaver’s games, both won their first frames, but the Stag players were able to rebound, taking the next two sets.
“This coming week we’re going to practice more doubles to sharpen our skills a bit,” Tchan said. “In singles, we’re going to continue to push each other and work hard.”
HARVARD 5, ILLINOIS STATE 2
After dropping three straight doubles matches against Illinois State (10-5), Harvard was able to secure a victory by decisively defeating the Redbirds in five of six singles matches.
Though all three doubles matches were relatively close, the Crimson was unable to pull out any victories.
The team of sophomore Andy Nguyen and junior Alistair Felton played well against the Illinois State pair of senior Filip Miljevic and freshman Mya Smith-Dennis on the second court, but they still fell 8-7.
“Illinois State was a really tough match for us,” Tchan said. “It was our first match since spring break. We started playing rusty in the doubles, and we just weren’t playing as well we could have [played].”
But the doubles matches did not deter Harvard during the singles matches, as the Crimson shook off its spring break rust.
“We played really well coming out of the box playing singles,” Fish said. “They got out to a lead in just about every match, which tends to put a lot of pressure on the other team.”
On the first court, nationally-ranked junior Jonathan Pearlman defeated Redbird sophomore Alexander Pelaez, 6-2, 6-4.
The Crimson had similar success on courts three through five as Felton, Nguyen, and freshman Casey MacMaster cruised past their opponents in straight sets.
Tchan had a tougher match, winning the first set, 6-2, but losing the second, 7-6. In the final set tiebreak, Tchan was able to muster a win, 10-6.
The only loss that Harvard suffered in singles play was at court two, where captain Aba Omodele-Lucien was blanked by Illinois State senior Timon Reichelt, 7-5, 7-5.
After the victories, the Crimson has more confidence heading into matches against Cornell and Columbia next weekend.
“We play what is considered the top [Ivy] team in Cornell on Friday,” Fish said. “There are a lot of good teams, but there’s nobody that’s unbeatable. We’ll see what happens; we’ll be one of those good teams but better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small room at the Harvard Kennedy School was transformed into the setting of a Malawi aid coordination meeting last Friday as students from four Harvard graduate schools, Boston University, and Tufts gathered to simulate a global health conference.
The 31 students who participated were assigned to play the role of delegates from agencies that included the Ministry of Finance of Malawi, the United States Agency for International Development, and the World Health Organization.
Andrea Feigl, a student at the School of Public Health, acted as a regional director of the World Health Organization. Feigl said the hands-on experience was “better than writing a paper” but said that it wasn’t easy—pushing an agenda with other stakeholders involved proved challenging.
“We wanted to make sure that WHO was more recognized in providing things for the citizens, and we fell a little bit short of that,” Feigl said of the mock negotiations. “But, overall, we were happy with the commitment to health and to our funding.”
The students attended a coaching session and a negotiation workshop prior to the event to help them assume the role of the characters they portrayed.
As part of the simulation, the students had to deal with obstacles that real-life delegates in a health conference would encounter, such as deciding how to allocate resources, determining priorities, and finding outside support.
“This experience is really nice because it allowed to simulate not one specific negotiation, but is really emblematic of all sorts of negotiations,” Joshua L. Glasser, a student at the School of Public Health, said. “You could easily apply what we talked about today to any sort of negotiation.”
Organizers said they chose Malawi as an example because it was seen as representative of the types of problems that many developing countries face. The mock negotiations concluded with a speech by HSPH Dean Julio J. Frenk.
Frenk said the conference was in line with the mission of the School of Public Health to ensure that knowledge gets translated into policies that can improve the livelihood of people.
“This exercise of simulation of the decision-making process of a negotiation is preparing the next generation of leaders who are actually going to be playing those roles,” Frenk said. “And we want that to be an integral part of their educational experience.”
Cecil M. Haverkamp, coordinator of strategic partnerships and global health practice at the School of Public Health, proposed the idea for last year’s initial conference as part of a desire to create an interactive, outside-of-the-classroom experience for students studying global health.
Singh said he believes there will be another health conference simulation next year.

Gabriella Blum, an expert in the laws of war and conflict resolution, has been given tenure and promoted from assistant professor to professor. A former lawyer in the Israeli Defense Forces, Blum teaches international law at the Law School.
Blum earned both her undergraduate and law degrees at Tel-Aviv University. Later, she earned two degrees from HLS—a terminal degree in law and a master of law degree—before becoming an assistant professor.
Blum writes, researches, and teaches primarily in the laws of war, terrorism, public international law, and negotiation.
Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz said he first met Blum when she was a major in the Israeli Defense Forces, where he said she was regarded as one of the force’s most brilliant young lawyers. Dershowitz said that the faculty voted to give Blum tenure with “wide-spread consensus.”
“She has an unparalleled knowledge of the laws of war in the books and in practice,” Dershowitz said.
Dershowitz added that, through a combination of practical experience and theory, Blum has a knowledge of the laws of war “unmatched in our faculty.”
Law School Professor Philip B. Heymann, who co-wrote a book and has taught courses with Blum, said that Blum’s background make her a unique addition to the senior faculty.
“She has seen situations that other people haven’t seen, and she’s taken actions and seen people take actions that others have only had to think about,” Heymann said. “Having that kind of experience seems to me to be extremely valuable.”
Heymann said that Blum was an “excellent and obvious” choice for tenure because of her ability to think freely, her imaginative writing, and her ability to challenge students on their preconceived notions about war.
“She thinks for herself and doesn’t accept what are widely accepted patterns of belief about war or terrorism,” Heymann said.
Dershowitz said Blum’s promotion is “the most natural ascension in my 47 years” at HLS, calling her a “tremendous addition” to the staff.
“Harvard Law School has been my home away from home,” Blum said in a statement released by the Law School. “I’m delighted and honored to be part of this singularly great community of scholars, students, and staff.”

Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences met Friday in the second symposium to discuss the school’s initiatives on teaching and learning, which FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has identified as a lead priority in a Faculty Meeting at the start of the academic year.
The panel discussion was led by Department Chair of Sanskrit and Indian studies Diana L. Eck, East Asian Languages and Civilization Professor Peter K. Bol, and Professor of African and African American Studies Caroline N. Elkins. Each discussed his or her approach to providing a greater global angle into their course curricula.
“I choose the angle of images that represent India,” Eck said, detailing how she uses powerful images of practicing Hindus and striking Hindu imagery to motivate her classroom discussions on the religion.
She added that her class has benefited from a greater number of students of Indian origin—who have contributed a more personal element to the discourse.
“That dynamic has changed things very dramatically—in a very pleasant way,” she said.
Bol, a non-native speaker of Chinese, discussed the unique dynamic he experienced when teaching Chinese history to a Chinese student—in English.
“And he said to me, ‘You really surprised me—I didn’t know that you could teach Chinese history not in Chinese,’” Bol said with a light laugh.
Bol added that symposia like this one help unite the message of the important relationship between research and pedagogy.
“Without researching—and that curiosity—you can’t have teaching and learning,” Bol said.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds will host the third symposium on integrating collections into the classroom on April 1.
The teaching and learning program, which aims to improve the school’s policies on education, was established after a task force identified improving teaching and learning as a priority in a 2007 report.
“To renew its commmitment to excellence, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences must motivate and empower committed teachers as well as distinguished researchers, and actively encourage intelligent pedagogy as well as pathbreaking research,” the report said.
Smith has adopted the initiative as a top priority for the school since his appointment as FAS dean in July 2007. But department chairs have said in the past that the economic crisis and the school’s resulting $220 million deficit has hindered progress on the project.
The first symposium, held on February 11, concentrated on active learning, according to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Allan M. Brandt.

Barefoot and assembled in a large circle singing “moto wayaka”—Swahili for “a fire has been lit,”—40 high school students from Boston-area schools concluded their day-long program on a wide range of issues affecting Africa run by students at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on Saturday.
In addition to attending panels and keynote speeches alongside University affiliates at the Harvard African Development Conference, the students participated in discussions and role-played nation-building with graduate students at the Ed School.
Julie M. Ficarra, one of the graduate students who began the initiative to incorporate local high school students into the conference, said the program’s curriculum would help fill in knowledge gaps about Africa that high schools do not teach. For example, in one discussion, a student asked what sub-Saharan Africa was and why the distinction between it and North Africa existed; another asked about the concept of a panel.
“It’s really important for high school students to be inspired by this program to know a little bit about Africa,” Ficarra said. “It’s not just movies like Hotel Rwanda and Blood Diamond. It’s a complicated place.”
However, Ficarra added that there were adjustments in the curriculum for students who already had previous knowledge of African culture and politics—students like Prospect Hill Academy senior Elias Estabrook, whose family worked for the UN in Niger. Estabrook said the main benefit of the program was meeting peers from multiple backgrounds and discussing the experiences of his graduate student leaders in Africa.
“We don’t want to be talked to the whole time but to be able to voice our opinions and build on our dreams and passions,” he said.
For Lawrence High School senior Kesy Delilo, whose great-great-grandmother was brought as a slave from Africa to Brazil, the most important lesson was about foreign aid on the continent.
“You learn the boundaries for knowing when you’re helping and when you’re just getting in the way,” she said. “You need to know your own limitations.”
Though the program was only a day long, Boston Latin Academy English teacher Lillian Marshall said she felt its lessons would be helpful for her students in the program.
“It could be that these students, because they have a respect for and knowledge of Africa, will have extra career opportunities that they wouldn’t have had before,” Marshall said.

The American political climate has undergone substantial changes since President Obama took office, Government Professor Theda R. Skocpol said in her Alexis de Tocqueville Lecture on American Politics last Friday.
Skocpol discussed the Tea Party’s impact on the Republican Party and speculated about the 2012 elections during an event sponsored by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies called “Obama’s New Deal, Tea Party Reaction, and America’s Political Future.”
Skocpol commented on the first two years of the Obama presidency, and the erosion of public support seen in the midterm elections. She said changes in voting demographics—including a higher turnout of older, white voters in the 2010 elections—is a natural part of democratic politics.
“Only the starry-eyed would have assumed otherwise,” Skocpol said.
Though Skocpol said the Obama administration “did achieve a lot” during its first two years, successes in the policy realm did not “lead to political payoffs.”
“In fact, it arguably led to much more than the usual cyclical turn [back to the Republicans],” she said.
Skocpol also discussed her personal conversations with Tea Party members and their influence on the midterm elections.
“Many are very well informed of the lawmaking process, but they don’t know what is in the bills,” she said.
The forum also featured commentary from Government Professor Daniel Carpenter, Princeton Professor Larry M. Bartels, former Oklahoma Congressperson and Aspen Institute Director Marvin Henry “Mickey” Edwards, and Cornell Professor Suzanne Mettler.
Edwards said the Obama administration may have miscalculated the strength of public support for their policy initiatives.
“There is a chance that the American people did understand and simply disagreed with what he was trying to do. It is surprising when you find the public you thought was behind you standing somewhat off to the side,” Edwards said.
The panel also cited the current administration’s general failure to explain many of its policies and actions to the American people as a contributing factor to public opposition.
“Those policies that Obama sought to reform were generally invisible to most Americans,” Mettler said.
“I came to learn more about what’s going on in politics,” Cambridge resident Tim Abraham said. “I’m glad [Skocpol] brought up the story of what’s in the healthcare bill. No one’s really explained it to me either.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A judge is currently considering whether former Harvard student Brittany J. Smith can legally be tried for her involvement in the May 2009 Kirkland shooting, despite the non-prosecution agreement she signed in July 2009.
Smith was indicted on six counts—including accessory after the fact of murder, illegal possession of a firearm, and willfully misleading a grand jury—in March 2010. Prosecutors claimed that she had lied to investigators, thereby violating the terms of the non-prosecution agreement they had made with her in exchange for her cooperation against the three other defendants in the case.
However, Smith’s attorney has argued that the state does not have grounds to revoke its agreement, and Smith should not be allowed to stand trial.
With Smith’s trial date set to begin in less than a month, the question of whether she can be prosecuted in this case has still not been settled by a judge.
NOW COMES THE COMMONWEALTH
In lengthy documents filed in Middlesex Superior Court, prosecutors outline the lies they allege Smith told investigators, which they say gives them cause to dismiss the non-prosecution agreement.
The state says that Smith made several false and misleading statements in order to protect her then-boyfriend Jabrai Jordan Copney, who allegedly fired the shot that killed Cambridge resident Justin Cosby, from the charge of felony murder.
Smith told prosecutors that when Copney and the two other men implicated in the murder—Jason Aquino and Blayn Jiggetts—came to her Lowell House room immediately following the shooting with a gun in his hand, “it was the first gun she had ever seen closely in her life. She specifically stated that she had never seen Jordan [Copney] or ‘Bliz’ [Jiggetts] with a gun before.”
However, Jiggetts told investigators that Smith watched him load the gun in her dorm room prior to the fatal meeting with Cosby.
Prosecutors further allege that Smith withheld knowledge of an earlier, related crime which would have strengthened their case against Copney.
Six months prior to the Kirkland murder, Copney and Jiggetts allegedly stole three pounds of marijuana at gunpoint from two Yale undergraduates—whom they met in Smith’s dorm room during the weekend of the 2008 Harvard-Yale football game.
Aquino, Jiggetts, and former Harvard student Chanequa N. Campbell—who was denied graduation by the University due to her connection with the Kirkland shooting—all stated that the 2008 robbery served as a model for the “drug rip” which the defendants planned to pull off on Cosby. Several lawyers familiar with the case have said that it will be important for prosecutors to establish the earlier robbery as a blueprint for the Cambridge crime, since the charge of first-degree murder rests on the fact that the murder was committed in the process of an attempted felony—in this case, the armed robbery of drugs from Cosby.
Prosecutors say that Smith could have helped them prove the precedence of the earlier robbery and that she instead withheld her knowledge of that theft.
When asked before the grand jury whether she knew about that robbery, Smith said that she had been asked about it by her friend Campbell but that she did not know anything about it.
Yet when police retrieved the murder weapon from the place where Smith admitted she had hidden it—under a friend’s bed in Lowell House—they found two IDs which Copney and Jiggetts had taken from the Yale students stashed in the same bag. Prosecutors say that this—along with Campbell’s testimony that she told Smith about her boyfriend’s involvement in an earlier robbery—proves Smith’s knowledge of the crime, which she neglected to share with police.
Smith told investigators that she believed Copney was going to buy drugs from Cosby when he met him in the basement of the Kirkland annex. But police say her conduct the day of the shooting further proves—in addition to her alleged sighting of the gun before it was fired and her alleged knowledge of the earlier robbery—that she knew the meeting would be a theft, not a transaction.
Several people, including Smith, have testified that she packed her bags before the shooting because she intended to go home to New York that evening. Yet court documents say that Smith had made plans via text message to meet a friend in the Dunster House dining hall for dinner that night. Prosecutors contend that Smith must not have had plans to depart Cambridge until she learned that her boyfriend and his associates were about to carry out an armed robbery.
TWO VERSIONS OF A ROMANCE
In a string of documents, the defense and the prosecution offer competing narratives of the events leading up to and following the shooting in the Kirkland annex. The depiction of Smith and Copney’s relationship in the two sides’ versions of events is strikingly different.
While prosecutors argue that Smith had a serious and ongoing relationship with Copney, which could provide a motive to lie in his defense, the defense aims to show that they did not have a strong attachment.
The state’s memorandum cites evidence from Smith’s “numerous” calls and visits to Copney in prison, all of which were recorded with the knowledge of both parties.
In these conversations, prosecutors write, “[Smith] indicates her hope that she is pregnant with [Copney’s] child. They agree that they will try to find a way to be married, and she describes research she has performed so that she can marry him in prison.”
The memorandum states, “The Commonwealth views these calls as reflecting an ongoing relationship of sufficient intensity that Smith is willing to lie to obstruct justice.”
Reading the motion filed by Smith’s attorney John T. Osler, one finds a very different view of Smith and Copney’s romance.
In Osler’s summary, he writes, “Smith and Copney had a strained relationship.”
Osler writes that Campbell recalled Smith being displeased that Copney was “taking her money and spending it all on marijuana.”
The defense’s motion claims that Copney once had sex with Campbell and refers to several instances in which Copney spoke disparagingly of Smith.
According to an account provided to investigators by one of the Yale students from whom Copney stole drugs, “Copney spoke of Smith and told the men that she was not really his girlfriend but just someone he was having sex with and that he had ‘more on the side or something.’”
Jiggetts—one of the alleged accomplices—described the relationship in more blunt terms, saying that Copney had called Smith his “meal ticket.”
NULL AND VOID?
At the moment, the question of whether Smith can be prosecuted hinges not on the attorneys’ salacious suggestions about Smith’s relationship with Copney but on the decision of a Superior Court judge.
The non-prosecution agreement that Smith signed in July 2009 states that the District Attorney’s office can declare the arrangement “null and void” in the event that “it is determined that [Smith’s] cooperation, assistance or testimony has not been complete, candid and truthful.”
Former prosecutors said that the D.A.’s office has the authority to revoke such an agreement in the event that a defendant is untruthful.
“When the Commonwealth goes the distance and says, ‘Okay, we’re not going to prosecute you,’ you have to do certain things,” said Karen A. Colucci, a defense lawyer and former Middlesex assistant district attorney.
Smith’s attorney contests prosecutors’ allegation that Smith broke that agreement, saying that the state’s case against Smith’s truthfulness rests on unreliable testimony provided by individuals involved in the crime.
“What is it that the government finds so unsatisfactory about Smith’s performance? ... On what basis?” Osler’s motion asks. “The government seeks to abrogate the non-prosecution agreement principally on the basis of isolated segments of the statements made by Jiggetts, Campbell, and Aquino.”
The decision is now in the court’s hands. Osler confirmed that the matter was discussed at a hearing earlier this month but said it is still under consideration.
“If she did in fact lie—if she gave false information knowingly, the court’s going to have to decide,” Colluci said. “They may nullify that agreement, and if they do so, she can be prosecuted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While one defendant implicated in the 2009 murder in Kirkland House pleaded guilty Thursday and a second is set to go to trial next week, the status of Blayn Jiggetts, the third man accused of the crime, remains unclear because his case file has been impounded by a Superior Court judge.
Jiggetts has been charged with first-degree murder, armed robbery, and three other counts.
When a court orders material impounded, it is no longer publicly available, and Middlesex Superior Court has impounded the entirety of Jiggetts’ case file.
John A. Amabile—the attorney for Jabrai Jordan Copney, the man charged with firing the shot that killed 21-year-old Cambridge resident Justin Cosby—said he plans to file a motion today to have Jiggetts’ case file unimpounded. “I want to get my hands on the docket,” he said. “The DA, I don’t believe, will oppose that.”
According to lawyers familiar with the case and The Boston Globe, Jiggetts has agreed to plea guilty to manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, rather than first-degree murder, which would come with a mandatory life sentence. In return, Jiggetts has agreed to testify during Copney’s upcoming murder trial.
Jason Aquino, another man indicted on charges related to the murder, accepted a similar agreement and pleaded guilty to manslaughter last week. His attorney said that he has agreed to a recommended sentence of 18 to 20 years in prison. Aquino has not agreed to testify against Copney.
The schedule available at the Middlesex Superior Court clerk’s office states that Jiggetts will stand trial beginning on April 25, and the docket provided by the clerk’s office—which lists no activity in the case since Aug. 2010—denotes Jiggetts’ plea to all counts as not guilty. However, since Jiggetts’ case file has been impounded by the court, reporters are prevented from viewing it, and Amabile said that Jiggetts has already pleaded guilty in secret.
Amabile said that Daniel J. Bennett ’85, a prosecutor in the case, told him that Jiggetts has pleaded guilty.
Both prosecutors in the case, Middlesex District Attorney’s Office Spokesperson Cara O’Brien, and Jiggetts’ attorney George E. Murphy Jr. ’70 all declined to state whether Jiggetts has pleaded guilty. Several cited the fact that his case file is impounded as their basis for not discussing the current status of the case.
“They sort of snuck him in there to plead him out,” Amabile said. “For some reason they wanted to keep this under wraps. I don’t know why.”
Karen A. Colucci, a criminal defense lawyer and former Middlesex assistant district attorney, said that it would be “pretty unusual” for a guilty plea to be kept secret.
“I have to say I am surprised—usually if somebody pleads guilty, it’s in open court,” Colucci said. “Usually a plea is a matter of public record—documents in the file can be impounded, but the fact that somebody pled is a matter of public record.”
Several people with knowledge of Superior Court procedure said that a case file is typically impounded when it contains information that might endanger the safety of a witness or victim. This is most common in sexual assault cases, they said.
Prosecutors allege that Jiggetts, 21, and the two other men arranged to meet Justin Cosby—a 21-year-old Cambridge resident who court documents say sold drugs to Harvard students—at Harvard on May 18, 2009, with the intention of stealing drugs from Cosby. In the ensuing meeting in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway, Copney allegedly shot Cosby, using a gun that Jiggetts obtained prior to the men’s trip to Cambridge and loaded before the crime.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of March Madness, sports enthusiasts from across the nation addressed the legal framework of intercollegiate sports at Harvard Law School’s third annual Sports Law Symposium, hosted on Friday by the Committee on Sports and Entertainment Law.
This year’s panelists comprised some of the most influential figures in sports, including world champion skier Jeremy R. Bloom, Boston Celtics’ assistant general manager Mike Zarren—an HLS graduate—and keynote speaker Sonny Vaccaro, a leading figure in the world of basketball and an advocate for student athletes.
The conference brought together 36 panelists and 125 other attendees, representing 26 universities and many of the most prominent law firms and sports media outlets.
The five panels covered topics relating to the overarching theme of the conference, “The Changing Face of Intercollegiate Athletics: Amateurs, Academics and the Athletic Arms Race.”
The topic, which was chosen by members of CSEL with the support of HLS sports law lecturer Peter A. Carfagna ’75, reflected upon the transformation that intercollegiate athletics have already undergone into a multibillion dollar business.
The subjects of the panels focused on the illusion of “amateurism”—the notion that athletes are pre-professional—in inter-collegiate athletics.
Attendee Harry R. Lewis ’68, former Dean of Harvard College and Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science, teaches a freshman seminar entitled “Amateur Athletics” that discusses many of the same topics.
“It was a great symposium,” Lewis said. “It just confirmed my suspicion that the NCAA is a tyrannical organization. It’s too bad they didn’t have a rep here. I’m sure it was not for want of trying.”
Second year law student and co-chair of the symposium organizing committee Xander Marcus ’09 said representatives of the NCAA were invited to the event.
“But, in fairness, this is a pretty busy time of year for them, what with the tournament and all.”
The NCAA men’s basketball tournament, which will reach its conclusion on April 4, is the most popular and visible event on the NCAA calendar, dominating much of Friday’s conversation.
The fourth panel of the day, “Litigating Against the NCAA,” was highlighted by the participation of NCAA men’s basketball champion, former UCLA star Ed O’Bannon and his legal counsel, Jon King.
O’Bannon, the lead plaintiff in the highly publicized class-action law suit O’Bannon v. NCAA, alleges that the NCAA is violating antitrust laws in barring former college athletes from profiting from NCAA or college-licensed products that use their images or likenesses, such as video games and merchandise sales.
Marcus said he believes that the best feature of this event is the opportunity it provides for personal interaction between attendees.
“It’s a networking opportunity in the best, least job-centric sense of the word,” Marcus said. “It’s about meeting people with similar interests and forming connections and relationships that are beneficial for everyone.”
“Sports law is a widespread discipline, but most schools don’t have more than one ‘sports person’,” Marcus said. “It’s great to provide a forum for them to talk to their peers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Westboro Baptist Church plans to protest Harvard’s memorial service for the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, according to the church’s spokesperson Shirley Phelps-Roper. The service for Gomes, who died last month, will be held on April 6 in Memorial Church.
Gomes died last month after serving 35 years as the Pusey Minister of the Memorial Church. He was long revered as the University’s spiritual leader and as a prominent advocate for equality both on campus and around the world.
Gomes, who was openly gay, has been a frequent target of the Kansas church that is best known for picketing military funerals to protest what it views as the pro-gay agenda of the United States. The church is notorious for displaying offensive signs when picketing while shouting homophobic slurs and language condemning the United States.
Phelps-Roper said that the upcoming picket will be the latest of many that the group has held in protest of Gomes, including demonstrations against several of his speaking engagements in Kansas.
“He, in the name of God, teaches rebellion against God. You may not say ‘gay Christian,’” said Phelps-Roper, explaining why the Church had chosen to protest Gomes’ memorial service. “That’s called an oxymoron and highly educated students should know what that is.”
Memorial Church spokesperson Justin Mullane said that church officials are aware of WBC’s plans and that the Harvard University Police Department has been notified.
The Cambridge Police Department and HUPD did not immediately return requests for comment.
WBC has picketed at Harvard several times in the last few years, including holding a picket outside of Harvard      Hillel this past December.
That protest, along with those from years before, prompted counter-protests by a variety of Harvard student groups. The Crimson that reported December’s counter-protest drew between 200 and 300 students.
Marco Chan ’11—co-chair of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies and who helped plan counter-protests in the past—said that the QSA would consider how to respond to the WBC’s latest plans.
“I’ve been proud of how the Harvard community has responded every time,” he said. “It’s more about our own commitment to tolerance and diversity than it was about them.”
Chan said that the QSA may be hesitant to protest again given concern that putting the spotlight on WBC would detract from the celebration of Gomes’ life and teachings.
He also said that the WBC’s visits have grown so frequent that a counter-protest might not be the most effective response.
According to University Spokesperson John D. Longbrake, WBC protesters will not be permitted to enter University property and will only be able to access city and public property.
Phelps-Roper said her group, which is currently planning on bringing seven people, will protest at a busy intersection in Harvard square.
She said her Church has held more than 45,000 pickets nationwide.
“For 20 years we’ve been on the streets of doomed America,” she said. “I’m on the road every week.”

To amplify the voices of people with intersex conditions and to shed light on the medicalization of intersex identities, The Women’s Center handed the microphone at an event Friday to documentary filmmaker Robin Honan and intersex historian Elizabeth Reis to vocalize the crossroads of medical and social thought on intersex bodies.
The event, called “Recording Intersex,” focused on the language used to discuss intersex individuals and examined how the term intersex has evolved. Honan introduced the term as a congenital condition in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that is “atypical,” or does not conform with common definitions of female or male.
“I want you to think a lot about language. Chromosomes. Sophomore year of high school. XX and XY. The binary and its limitations,” Honan said. “What do we do when we find ourselves outside of it? Here we are in 2011 looking for language to talk about this.”
Both Honan and Reis also discussed the term DSD, or disorder of sex development, a contested word that they said is commonly used to define intersex conditions. They noted a recent shift toward substituting “disorder” with “difference” or “divergence to avoid implying a necessary medical fix.
“Often, people sought to surgically alter the bodies of those with intersex conditions instead of changing how we talk about it” said Miriam Muscarella ’12, an organizer of the event. “Today, instead of surgically altering intersex bodies, many people are pushing for more objective, clear, and non-pejorative terminologies to refine how people with intersex conditions are medically treated and commonly understood.”
Following the event’s theme of recording, Reis also noted the lack of data recorded on intersex individuals.
“Little has been preserved in medical libraries,” said Reis, author of “Bodies in Doubt” and a professor at the University of Oregon. “I’d see ‘An extraordinary find! A hermaphrodite,’ and that was the best use of language. Other ways of describing intersex individuals were impostor, deceiver, hybrid, and unfortunate monstrosity—all derogatory ways people with intersex conditions were discussed.”
Honan shared a clip from her recent documentary project entitled “Ain’t I a Woman”—slated for release as a feature-length film in 2013—which explores facets of intersex identity through the lens of the lives and experiences of individuals with intersex conditions.
“I’m just being exposed to the wide spectrum of intersex conditions and the various controversies over the types of procedures necessary for people with those conditions,” said Bradley L. Craig ’13, an intern at the Women’s Center.
Eva M. Gillis-Buck ’12, a human developmental and regenerative biology concentrator pursuing a joint concentration in Women, Gender and Sexuality, said she wished Honan’s video was presented to undergraduate medical school aspirants.
As a student of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology 10: “Human Development and Regenerative Biology,” she recalled a lecture on sex development and differentiation which presented intersex conditions. The lecture, she said, did not fully address the social and cultural implications of people with intersex conditions.
“This was revealing of how much society values sex as cut and dry. Male and female are seen as biological truths. Intersex individuals show this to be false, and I wished we would’ve addressed sensitivity to patients,” Gillis-Buck said.
“This may be the only lecture pre-med students will receive on sex development, and it would be a shame for them to walk away without a more human aspect,” she added.
At the event, debates over social surgery versus medical surgery were also raised in conjunction with questions regarding the ethics of surgical alterations.
To this end, Honan said she endeavors to use film as a conduit to create a world more friendly to intersex conditions.
“What animates me is the evolution of human consciousness on the macro level. In this issue, you can see positive change and the climb out of the binary, opening up to what is a freer and more expressed world,” Honan said. “Our strength is in our diversity, in biology and culture. We are trying to create a world in which people can be their fullest selves; in which it doesn’t matter if people’s bodies are different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed an act that calls for a weekly list of on-campus events to be sent to interested students at an unusually heated meeting where members had to consult the UC constitution to determine the legitimacy of the voting procedure and one member said that the initial version of the legislation would turn the UC into “mercenaries.”
The Undergraduate Council Vericorps Act, which passed by a vote of 15-10 with three abstentions, will result in the creation of VeriCorps, whose mission will be to assist recognized student organizations with events.
In order to do this, interested members of both the UC and student body may sign up to receive a weekly email that lists student-run events taking place that week. Members of VeriCorps can volunteer to assist in the execution of these events.
“This will have multiple benefits because not only can students try out an event and see if they like a club, but it will provide student organizations with the extra manpower that they need.” Crimson Yard representative Jennifer Q. Y. Zhu ’14, the sponsor of the act, said.
However, the original version of the legislation failed to pass, and several members urged the council to refer the act back to committee for reevaluation and revision. But even the committee to which this legislation would be referred became one of many topics argued during a lengthy debate.
One of the most controversial issues with the original legislation was the required participation of all UC members within VeriCorps.  Members complained that they did not want to be “bound” to the organization, saying that they felt they deserved a choice regarding membership.
“I’m not voting against this because I feel that the legislation is dangerous,” Kirkland House representative Brad M. Paraszczak ’11 said. “It’s just that 14 votes in favor of passing when there are about 51 people on the Council clearly shows that we don’t have the voice of people who would be bound by this if it were to pass.”
Others shared concerns with the philosophy of the legislation, arguing that the UC is supposed to advocate for students, not license members out as, in one member’s words, “mercenaries.”
Throughout the debate, Zhu maintained composure amid expressions of exasperation by the members, urging them to keep in mind that this would be a pilot program and a continuous work-in-progress.
“We will be carefully examining the organization and see what we can do to improve it,” Zhu, who is also a Crimson photographer, said. “Think of it as innocent until proven guilty—we will try it out, and if it doesn’t work, we can revoke it.”
After nearly 30 minutes of debate, a final vote was taken and the legislation passed.
“I think legislation like this is what the UC should be doing to try to engage with students,” said UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12. “I’m really optimistic about the success of this and look forward to checking back on it in six to eight months.”

During a packed event at Memorial Church, Malalai Joya, a celebrated Afghani activist who was granted a visa after the State Department initially rejected her application last week, said unequivocally that the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan has harmed the lives of most Afghanis far more than it has helped.
Joya spoke alongside MIT Professor Noam Chomsky, who also warned against the often overlooked dangers of the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan.
“The United States invaded my country under the banner of women’s rights, human rights and democracy, but today we are as far from those goals as we were in 2001,” Joya said. “They keep the situation lawless and unsafe to have an excuse to stay on in Afghanistan for their own interests.”
Although the U.S. government has long decried the Taliban as the main enemy in Afghanistan, Joya said that, for the Afghan people, the United States is just as malicious a force.
“The Afghan people are squashed between three enemies: the Taliban, warlords, and occupation forces,” Joya said.
Chomsky’s remarks also criticized U.S. actions in Afghanistan, saying that the general consensus among academics is that the war is “militarily unwinnable” and that the U.S. must come to an internal political settlement with Afghani and regional actors to bring peace to the region. Chomsky said that the U.S. interference in Afghanistan has the potential to destabilize the government in Pakistan, a country with the fastest growing nuclear arsenal in the world.
Addressing recent speculation about whether Joya’s visa denial last week was a mistake made by a State Department official or an active decision to exclude her based on her political views, Joya said she believed the U.S. government was trying to prevent her from voicing her opinions.
“The reason they refused to give me a visa, I think, is because I exposed the wrong policies of your government, and I talk about the reality of the so-called ‘war on terror,’ and I talk about the war crimes your government is committing in the name of the American people,” said Joya. “These are the reasons they are afraid of me and do not let me enter the U.S.”
Despite the initial visa denial and the five assassination attempts that Joya has survived, she vowed to continue speaking out against the injustices she believes are being committed in her country.
“I want to tell you from your podium that no one can keep me from telling the truth,” Joya said.
Those who attended the event said they enjoyed hearing perspectives that differed so dramatically from the ones generally presented in the U.S. media.
“There is so much propaganda and action under the guise of democracy and freedom, so to actually have an Afghani citizen be able to give her perspective is very powerful,” said Sophie Vener, an event attendee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Student Labor Action Movement once again called for Harvard University to cease investing in HEI Hotels & Resorts at an event Thursday where an employee of a hotel that is managed by the investment group spoke of a demotion he called unjust.
David Williamson, an employee at an Embassy Suites hotel in Irvine, Calif., said that he was once a well-paid janitor with benefits, according to William P. Whitham ’14 and Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, who are both SLAM members. Whitham said that when Williamson had to take some time off to assist his wife, who was diagnosed with glaucoma, he said he was demoted to one of the lowest janitorial positions, stripped of his benefits, and faced a decrease in pay.
The event came one day before the University of Pennsylvania announced that it would no longer make investments in the company. Prior to that, Brown University had said that it would end future investment in HEI.
SLAM is submitting a report to the University’s Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility calling for an end of investment in HEI, according to Korn, who is also a Crimson editorial writer. HEI has been accused by the United Students Against Sweatshops of violating worker rights in their hotels, including coercing workers and union busting.
“As a non-profit organization receiving tax breaks, Harvard has a standard of social responsibility,” Whitham said. “When Harvard invests money in ways that have negative effects on people, we believe the University should be held accountable.”
The University, however, has remained silent on the investment.
“While we do not generally discuss individual investments or investment strategies, Harvard has a strong institutional presumption against divesting stock for reasons unrelated to investment purposes,” Longbrake said, reiterating comments made earlier this year.
UNITE HERE, a union which includes hotel and food service workers such as employees in Harvard’s dining halls, has been trying to unionize workers in HEI-owned hotels but has been unsuccessful, which a leader of a local division of the union attributed to union-busting practices within the company.
“HEI runs a campaign of intimidation,” Edward B. Childs, the chief steward at UNITE HERE Local 26, said in an interview. “HEI is a terrible corporation. HEI must be stopped.”
SLAM is hopeful that the decision of Brown, as well as the more recent decision by Penn, to end future investment in HEI will spur Harvard to terminate its own investment in the company.
“We hope that Harvard will look at how other Ivy League schools have chosen not to invest,” Whitham said. “All Ivies have the same ethical standards and responsibilities.”

Buying designer jewelry usually means emptying your bank account, but tomorrow, Eleganza will be selling jewelry at drastically reduced prices. The annual Eleganza Jewelry Sale offers the opportunity to purchase designer jewelry from stores such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Ann Taylor, J. Crew, Anthropologie, as well as other vendors for over 90 percent off.
The event organizers boast that customers can purchase items priced as high as $200 dollars for as little as $8–$25. The sale, which is cash only, is taking place from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. tomorrow at the Democracy Center at 45 Mt. Auburn St.
According to event coordinator Victoria Martinez '12, all the items are donated from the vendors, and the proceeds from the sale help fund Eleganza's "Teen Empowerment" program, which organizes creative activities such as spoken word poetry, for urban young adults aged 14 to 21.
