After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall, with Facebook’s encouragement, my wall turned blue, red, and white in an effort of solidarity. If Facebook’s goal in creating this filter was simply to convince users to change their profile pictures, then Mark Zuckerberg and company succeeded. But why do we aim for a goal that is so easy to fulfill? The attacks in Paris were a tragedy—they were attacks against all of humanity. They deserve more.
The new Facebook filters that began last summer with “rainbowfication” in support of the Supreme Court’s decision on gay marriage achieve much less than it appears. In this age of social media and extensive online networks, we must not confuse simple reaction with sustained and impactful action. Changing our profile pictures is not the answer to global problems like terrorism, rampant militarism, violence, poverty, and war. One click humanitarism is not the answer to what happened in Paris.
My critique of the filters centers on two main points. The first surrounds the bias these filters project. Why did Facebook endorse a filter for Paris, but not for Syria or Beirut? Why did we only start to care when the attack was on people who look or think like us? By creating only a few choice filters—and encouraging them with the “Try It” button—Facebook does not allow for nuanced political statements. This is a mistake because our world is complex and mutli-layered, and its beauty comes from its diversity—this is a point central to Facebook’s identity in the first place. After all, Facebook has always been a champion of self-expression, promoting diversity by giving voices and choice to those who previously did not have them. It shouldn’t stop now.
Second, the filters are deceiving. Over the same weekend of the Paris attacks, I attended the 15th World Summit for Nobel Peace Laureates in Barcelona. In light of the attack, I felt honored to be in the company of such inspiring people. But the message of the Summit rang clear: What separated me from the people on the stage, me from the laureates, was that they had taken action to solve the world’s problems. They had not just pondered them or called out the injustices they saw; they actively worked to eliminate those injustices.
At a panel on Women and Democracy in the general plenary, 1997 laureate Jody Williams stated this very inconvenient truth: “Words without action are freaking irrelevant.” The impact of her truth applies greatly to my argument here: Changing our profile pictures without doing more has little worth.
Facebook filters not only filter our profile pictures, they mask out our anger, passion, frustration, and energy into a single simplistic reaction rather than a sustained or impactful response. Once we click it, we feel absolved of our humanitarian responsibilities, and often become unmotivated to do more. One click humanitarianism makes us feel better, but in this way it does not solve our greater problems. Our generation needs to learn from our Kony 2012 mistakes — we can’t just stop here.
This is not meant to be a critique of Facebook without solutions. Facebook should be proud that it is such an influential part of modern life—that it cares about social progress and justice.
But I am still calling on Facebook to use its tools and its potential to do more, to do better.  Facebook has 1.55 billion active monthly users! Allow public debates to occur on a single page or through the use of a hashtag in order to influence policy makers and government officials. Give users the options for their statuses to be given to politicians in place of traditional letter writing campaigns. Direct users through ads not to shopping sites, but to sites where they can learn more about the facts, where they can get involved in change.  These are things Facebook can do.
Finally, Facebook says that this was in an effort of solidarity. But solidarity does not mean that our responses must all look the same—especially if these responses do not go the distance.  We can each help in our own way and stand up on our own two feet. Solidarity means we stand behind the dignity and respect of the people in our world—that we strive for the protection of all humanity. It is time we truly act in solidarity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s no secret that Harvard has become an increasingly secular institution throughout its history. 
Consider Harvard’s original mission statement: “Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well the end of his life and studies is to know God and Jesus Christ, which is eternal life, and therefore to lay Christ in the bottom, as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning.” Suffice it to say that Harvard has changed greatly since 1636. It is no longer a school whose primary purpose is to instill the principles of a particular religion in its students.
Harvard, however, has become more than dissociated from Christianity; it has become exceptionally areligious.  Were Harvard entirely neutral with respect to religion, its students’ religious views would roughly align with those of society as a whole, meaning that only about 7 percent of any given Harvard class would be atheist or agnostic.
The results of The Crimson’s recent survey of the Class of 2019, though, demonstrate the contrary: 37.9 percent of respondents categorize themselves as agnostics or atheists. Harvard’s Classes of 2017 and 2018 are likewise disproportionately areligious, but the proportion of nonbelievers to Christians is only growing more skewed; more respondents from the Class of 2019 identified as agnostic or atheist than Christian, for the first time in the history of The Crimson’s surveys. These disparities cannot be coincidental, and they raise a crucial question: What exactly does it mean that so many Harvard undergraduates tend not to believe in any religion?
It must first be acknowledged that Harvard students, religious or not, live very worthwhile lives—they have had the drive and tenacity to gain entry to a prestigious and rigorous institution like Harvard. A sense of purpose necessarily pervades such lives; any person mired in nihilism would not strain herself to come to Harvard.
Furthermore, it must be granted that Harvard students are thoughtful. Harvard’s holistic admissions attest to this fact. It is part of the University’s mission to recruit a student body that can not only ace SAT’s and earn immaculate grades, but also reason independently and reflect on the world.
From the acceptance of both of these axioms (both of which are reasonable given the nature of Harvard’s liberal mission) it becomes apparent that Harvard students have not thoughtlessly become indifferent toward religion. Rather, many have reflected on its importance and concluded that it is not a prerequisite to the good and meaningful lives they are leading. This recent and drastic change is not negligible.
Many people fallaciously maintain that a meaningful existence presupposes belief in a higher entity. For example, Harvard College Faith and Action, a Christian student group, contended against Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics that a faithless life is without fail a purposeless one in a public debate at the beginning of the fall semester.  It is understandable that HCFA showed such aversion to the idea their worldview is not accepted as absolute truth by all people who strive to find meaning in the world; they do not want to concede the dispensability of their most deeply held beliefs.  Indeed, the debate was more an exercise in self-reassurance for HCFA than in the refutation of HCHAA’s views.
Such questions as the merits of a secular life, however, are best decided by empirical evidence rather than abstract debates of theory like the one between HCFA and HCHAA. And Harvard’s Class of 2019 is a piece of irrefutable evidence. Its agnostics and atheists have found a more than satisfactory sense of purpose and direction, despite what they believe may be the ultimate nature of the universe.
These changes at Harvard have ramifications for society at large. Harvard’s students go on in their lives to become presidents and leaders. They are trend-setters. If they find a secular life perfectly fulfilling, then perceptions of disbelief may begin to change. Stigmata undeniably surround it—for example, only 58 percent of Americans would vote for an atheist president. Though this number may seem surprisingly large, it is unconscionable that 42 percent of Americans would deny a candidate office over a matter like religion. Would this 42 percent suppose that the 37 percent of Harvard freshmen who do not believe in any higher entity are any less moral because of their beliefs? Any less apt to lead?
Recent changes in the student body at Harvard legitimate the meaningfulness and value of a secular life, and this change may impact society as a whole. This is not to say that religion should become or is obsolete; it is only to submit that persons who reject it deserve no contempt and a better image in society—an ideal that will become more and more attainable as a higher proportion of the population is faithless, as is the case at Harvard.
We live in a country built on the premise, among others, of religious freedom; may America continue to learn and evolve as Harvard has over its long and complex history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, the navy spiral-bound tome known as the Bluebook seems rather unremarkable. But beyond its covers, the book details thousands of obscure and specific legal citation rules that require more than a thousand hours to compile. The massive, 582-page legal citation manual inspires both devotion and dread in its users—law students, scholars, and lawyers—who require its guidance for their professional work.
Whether loved or hated, the nearly-100-year-old Bluebook is necessary for most legal work, scholars say. Today, it is published jointly by the Harvard Law Review Association—which completes a bulk of the editorial work—University of Pennsylvania Law Review, Columbia Law Review, and the Yale Law Journal. For decades, Harvard has claimed its dominance in the Bluebook’s origins and production—a claim that has, for the most part, gone unchallenged.
But now, some scholars are questioning Harvard’s narrative. The notorious Bluebook is at the center of not one, but two controversies challenging Harvard’s historic monopoly over its production.
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT
Did the Bluebook really originate at Harvard? That is the probing question two Yale law librarians asked in a recent and prominent article challenging Harvard’s narrative of the Bluebook’s founding.
Instead, the librarians— Fred R. Shapiro and Julie  Graves Krishnaswami—argue that Yale published the first version of the Bluebook.
Harvard’s claim is based on an account set by Erwin N. Griswold, former Law School dean and U.S. Solicitor General, who in a famous 1987 essay maintained the book was first produced at Harvard in the 1920s. The other three universities later began to contribute, and the first edition with all four universities listed on the copyright was published in 1934. 
Shapiro and Krishnaswami refute that narrative, which they call “wildly erroneous” but currently the “canonical account” of the manual’s origins. Their challenge rests on a discovery Shapiro made around 15 to 20 years ago in Yale Law Library’s rare book collection:  one page from a booklet of legal citation rules that appeared to be a precursor to Harvard's version.
If Shapiro and Krishnaswami are correct, the Yale booklet, dated five years earlier than Harvard’s supposed first edition, could arguably be the original version of the Bluebook. It is not immediately clear, though, whether the Yale  booklet is indeed the citation manual’s first version.
“It is ironic that a style manual that sets forth overwhelming detail about the format of accurate citations to authority, and that fosters a climate in which every assertion in legal writing must be supported by such citations, should have its own origins and history thoroughly mired in inaccuracy,” the librarians wrote.
For Shapiro, the challenge to Harvard’s narrative is vital; because the Bluebook is “an important institution in law, its history is of some importance,” he said.
“I just wanted to set the record straight as a matter of historical truth,” Shapiro said.
Still, Shapiro said their discovery of the manual’s possible New Haven origins is not necessarily a point of pride for Yale.
“I don’t think that it was any kind of enormous victory for Yale, particularly because there is this sort of love-hate relationship with the Bluebook,” Shapiro said.
The four universities in charge of creating the Bluebook have remained largely silent on the challenge to the book’s origins; together they said they are focused on the present, not the past.
“Whatever the ancient history might be, today we’re doing all we can to be the best possible stewards of a resource used by so many throughout the legal world,” they wrote in a joint statement.
Individually, Harvard Law Review declined to comment on the record for this story.
A COPYRIGHT QUANDARY
Harvard faces another, broader challenge from scholars who claim no single university or group of universities should be able to monopolize rights to the citation system.
Carl Malamud of Public.Resource.Org and New York University Law professor Christopher J. Sprigman argue that a universal citation system like the Bluebook’s is not copyrightable. Even more, they wrote in a 2013 letter to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and faculty, “enforcing a monopoly” over the manual in the Internet age is “immoral and nonsensical.”
In an effort to democratize legal writing, Malamud and Sprigman are launching BabyBlue, a free online resource that will explain the underlying citation rules of the Bluebook, but use different examples. BabyBlue is in the final stages of development and is set to be released soon, according to Malamud.
But the Harvard Law Review will not let BabyBlue be published without a fight.
In a series of strongly-worded letters spanning over the last two years, Harvard Law Review’s lawyers have repeatedly warned Malamud and Sprigman to stop their efforts before they violate copyright. The latest correspondence, dated December 24, requests that Malamud and Sprigman provide the Harvard Law Review Association with advance copies of BabyBlue.
Spelling out worries that the word ‘Blue’ in ‘BabyBlue’ will cause users to erroneously associate the new site with The Bluebook, the letter also demands that they change the title completely.
Describing the recent correspondence as “another keep-off-the-grass letter” Malamud said, “They haven’t seen anything I’ve done, [but] it looked like they were freaking out.”
Malamud said he has not furnished any documents for the lawyers and will not be changing BabyBlue’s name. He said he has never communicated directly with students at Harvard Law Review.
“I think that if they are worried, they’re overly worried and they ought to just pick up the phone and talk to me,” Malamud said.
Harvard Law Review’s efforts to stop BabyBlue will likely prove futile, according to some legal experts.
Harvard Law Professor Jeannie C. Suk said the Harvard Law Review would not have grounds to claim copyright infringement unless BabyBlue copies specific examples used in the Bluebook.
“It seems to me that trying to use copyright to protect the system of citation rules themselves is not promising, particularly given the already widespread adoption of those rules in the legal profession and by courts,” Suk wrote in an email.
Malamud insists that BabyBlue does not replicate Bluebook’s examples.
“I’m pretty confident that after they take a deep breath and look at what we’re doing, they’re going to look at it and say ‘okay’,” Malamud said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A different course load won’t be the only change for students when they come back from winter break— the new year is set to bring several developments to Harvard Square, including a new cafe and location of The Harvard Shop.
Capital One Cafe, a restaurant affiliated with the national bank, opened up its fifth Boston-area cafe at 24 JFK St. earlier last month. Capital One spokesperson Laura DiLello described the cafe as “a store within a store,” referring to its functions both as an eatery and bank. 
Customers can buy more than their morning beverage there: the store serves coffee and tea from Peet’s, as well as snacks, pastries, and sandwiches, and banking associates are available for customers in the cafe to discuss finances.
“It's a pretty unique customer experience as far as banking goes,” DiLello said. “You walk in and it is truly a cafe. There’s free WiFi, quiet spots to work, and plenty of outlets to charge your laptop or phone.”
The cafe is open to the general public, and customers can receive a 50 percent discount when using a Capital One credit or debit card, DiLello said. The cafe also hosts meeting rooms where nonprofit organizations can gather, according to DiLello. Although the cafe has been open for about a month now, the official ribbon cutting ceremony is set for Feb. 4.
Harvard Student Agencies has also detailed plans to open up their fourth The Harvard Shop storefront at 34 JFK St.—a space that now holds women’s clothing boutique Alo—within the next few months. The student-run retailer already has locations on Mount Auburn Street and JFK Street. Another branch in the Smith Campus Center location is set to close later this year as University planners ready for Smith Campus Center renovations.
“That part of JFK Street has a lot of foot traffic, so we’re really excited to have a window display  that opens straight onto the street,” HSA president Patrick F. Scott ’16 said. “The location has more floor space so we’re hoping to try out a lot of awesome new products.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Kendall Square-based organization New Politics, which supports veterans and other service-oriented people seeking elected office, is looking for success in its second election cycle.
The organization supported five service veterans during its first election cycle of activity in 2014. One of  those candidates, three-time Harvard degree holder and Iraq War veteran Seth W. Moulton ’01, was elected as a Massachusetts representative to the U.S. Congress.
Now, the non-partisan organization is guiding 13 candidates, at least five of whom have ties to Harvard, through elections for a wide range of political offices. Some candidates are running for Congress, while others are bidding for a spot on their local city council.
Emily Cherniack, the founder of New Politics and a former AmeriCorps volunteer, said she started the organization in order to help elect individuals who have worked in organizations that require an intensive service commitment, like the U.S. military or the Peace Corps. She said that her experience in City Year, a volunteer program within AmeriCorps that was founded by a Harvard graduate, inspired her to work with like-minded people.
“They’re super humble,” Cherniack said of individuals who have volunteered for  intensive service. “They’re mission driven. They have experience bringing diverse groups of people together to achieve a goal bigger than themselves.”
Cherniack hopes to ensure that “service veterans” have adequate resources to compete with mainstream politicians, many of whom have more support from partisan political organizations. On the day-to-day basis, she recruits prospective candidates from the service sector, connects them with resources, and advises them in the election process.
Sean L. Barney, an Iraq War veteran who received his master’s degree from Harvard, is running for Delaware’s lone congressional seat. Barney said he chose to work with New Politics for this election because the organization has helped him navigate a “difficult process.”
“Emily plays a vital role in helping people who have a demonstrated commitment to service, but may not have run for office or known the ins and outs of the process, to navigate that process,” he said.
Cherniack found another candidate, Harvard Kennedy School graduate Meagan W. Holman, through a shared connection at City Year. Holman served in the organization after college and said she thinks the experience gave her the skills required to be a successful politician. She is running for a position on the city council of  Milwaukee, Wis.
“City Year really teaches you a lot of things that can be transferred really easily into a career in politics,” Holman  said. “You learn a lot of event management, team building, and really good professional skills that are needed in the public sector.”
Indeed, both Cherniack and Barney said they believe it is important for America’s government to include people who have served.
“[Service]  teaches you a lesson about missions that are larger than yourself and teaches you that there are causes larger than yourself that are worth incurring personal cost for,” Barney said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Kennedy School undergoes a years long construction project while inching closer to its $500 million capital campaign goal, a top leadership change—not uncommon in recent years—could slow down the school’s plans. But Douglas W. Elmendorf, who became dean of the Kennedy School on Jan. 1, said he has not seen a slowdown in donations, and after over six months of preparation for his new post, plans to continue pre-existing initiatives.
While he hasn’t nailed down the specifics of his primary focuses, Elmendorf emphasized the importance of helping the school adopt modern teaching methods, fundraising for the capital campaign, seeing the construction on the HKS campus through to its completion, and keeping the cost of the Kennedy School— priced at over $70,000 yearly for some programs—low.
Elmendorf is a Princeton alumnus who received a master’s and Ph.D. in economics at Harvard. He then became an assistant professor of economics; two decades after leaving Cambridge, Elmendorf succeeds David T. Ellwood as dean, who stepped down in June .
He is taking over in the midst of the University’s $6.5 billion capital campaign. The Kennedy School has raised $470 million of its $500 million goal as of Jan. 12, according to Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel. Ellwood had predicted that donations would “inevitably slow down” after he stepped down as dean, but Elmendorf said he hasn’t seen “much of a lull” so far.
“The most important thing I’ve been doing is meeting people and learning what they do. There’s a tremendous array of people here,” Elmendorf said. “I’m trying to understand better what the school has accomplished so far and what direction we should go in.”
Elmendorf said he has been preparing for his deanship for the last six months by meeting with faculty, students, and potential donors to figure out down which path he will lead HKS.
“I was writing papers in economics, meeting people at the Kennedy School and around the University, and meeting supporters of the Kennedy School outside the University,” he said. “And I did some resting up.”
For the last two decades, Elmendorf has been in Washington, D.C. at the center of the economic policy-making world. First, he served as a researcher at the Federal Reserve, and most recently as the director of the Congressional Budget Office, where he assessed bills and provided economic information to Congress.
Elmendorf will oversee construction on the Kennedy School’s campus, which will add over 70,000 square feet of new buildings. He emphasized the importance of evolving teaching methods away from traditional lectures to a more collaborative and interactive classroom.
“There has been significant changes in pedagogy across the country in how teachers use classroom times, and have less lecture and more interactive activities,” Elmendorf said. “The Kennedy School needs to make sure it is keeping pace with how people think it’s best to teach and best to learn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Their names are familiar and unavoidable to students who inhabit the buildings and walk along the streets: Mather, Brattle, Holyoke.
Their histories—as slaveholders—have largely been overlooked since the buildings were erected and streets paved, until recently.
At both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, students, faculty, and administrators have begun reconsidering titles and symbols because of their associations with the legacy of slavery. At the College, the House Masters agreed unanimously last month to change their title, citing concerns about the racial implications of the term “Master.” Meanwhile, a group of students at Harvard Law School are calling for the removal of the school’s seal, which they criticize for its ties to the formerly slaveholding Royall family that endowed Harvard’s first law professorship in the 19th century.
In the the midst of discussions across Harvard about historical legacies and race, University President Drew G. Faust said that Harvard should not begin renaming its buildings or titles en masse.
For Faust, a Civil War historian, changing names or symbols amounts to falsely negating historical truths and legacies. Instead, Faust said in a December interview, the people and culture behind these names and titles should be historically understood and contextualized. Although she publicly supported the title change of the College’s House masters, Faust said she is undecided when it comes to changing the Law School’s seal, and cautioned against other name changes.
“I feel quite strongly that we should not be trying to erase our history of names,” Faust said. “I think we’re all going to be facing these questions, and the case that I would make is...about the importance of sustaining our history, not erasing it,” she later added.
‘TOO EASY TO FEEL INNOCENT’
As Harvard’s student body has become increasingly diverse, names and titles gracing buildings and positions for centuries have come under siege for their associations with a darker side of the University’s past.
At the College, students and House Masters said that recent conversations about race around the country had intensified existing concerns about the title, which they said suggests ownership over another person.
Citing decades-old conversations about the gender implications of the term “Master” and the more recent national discourse about race on college campuses as reasons for change, Faust said she supported the decision to change the “House Master” title. House Masters are expected to announce a new title early this year.
Still, Faust said she would oppose changing other symbols or names at Harvard—like Mather House—because of their potentially troubling historical origins. Increase Mather, the namesake of Mather House and an early Harvard president, owned slaves.
“I think if you erase the whole past, it’s too easy to feel innocent. It’s too easy to not learn from it and to think that you’re not going to make any mistakes in the present—you’re better than those mistakes. We’re not better than those mistakes,” she said. “Someone 200 years from now is going to wonder something about us—why we’re eating meat, why we’re doing things that we’re doing. And we have to be self-critical enough not to just assume that we’re so much better than people who had to make decisions under different circumstances and in different times.”
Faust taught American history at the University of Pennsylvania for more than two decades and has published a series of award-winning books about the antebellum-era American South and the Civil War. In December, Faust published an article titled “John Hope Franklin: Race & the Meaning of America” in the New York Review of Books, in which she wrote about the importance of complete historical understanding. In the article, Faust explores Franklin’s legacy for unflinching historical scholarship about racial inequality in America and the importance of history to modern discussions about race.
Still, Faust has yet to make up her mind about the changing of the Law School’s seal, saying she wants to learn more about the specifics of the case. At the end of November, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow appointed a committee of Law professors to study the seal and reconsider its use; that committee will submit a report to the Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing body, which will make the final decision, in March.
Members of the advocate group demanding that Harvard Law change its seal, “Royall Must Fall,” though, disagree with Faust’s line of thinking. Law student Alexander J. Clayborne, a member of the Royall Must Fall and Reclaim Harvard Law School student activist groups, said that buildings and titles at Harvard should be reevaluated on a case by case basis.
“The problem is the names on these buildings serve to honor these people; they serve to hold them up as someone to be imitated,” Clayborne said. “The fact of the matter is that these people engaged in morally reprehensible behavior and that shouldn’t be honored.”
WHAT’S IN A NAME?
Some of the people whose names have more recently christened Harvard’s programs, professorships, and buildings share Faust’s opposition to the erasure of Harvard’s more controversial figures.
Peter L. Malkin ’55, a New York real estate magnate and namesake of the Malkin Athletic Center, argued that Harvard’s previous leaders and benefactors should not be judged by modern moral standards.
“I think that there have been many changes in society since some of the names were designated, and that certain ways of doing things a few hundred years ago...are not acceptable now, but would not have been thought to be unacceptable at the time,” he said.
Elsewhere in the Ivy League, activists at Princeton are pushing to rename the Woodrow Wilson public policy school and a residential college in light of the former university president’s treatment of minorities. Yale students have circulated a petition to rename Calhoun residential college, arguing that its alleged endorsement of slaveholder John C. Calhoun “represents an indifference to centuries of pain and suffering among the black population.”
Paul J. Zofnass ’69, another prominent contributor to the University, agreed with Malkin and questioned the legality of revoking contracts by removing donors’ names from their buildings.
“I think questioning and challenging it is a healthy dynamic that takes place, but I don’t think you ultimately can come to the conclusion that you can break a contract or change a symbol,” Zofnass said.
Both Zofnass and Morgan Chu, a Law School alumnus and the former president of the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second highest governing body, said they supported the role of student activism in making these questions a part of campus discourse. The deanship of Harvard Law School is named for Chu, and for him, institutions should be open to change after a thorough examination of the facts.
“Institutions should change. Institutions should respond appropriately to suggestions and proposals for change,” Chu said, adding that he does not have a set point of view on the question of the Law School’s seal.
Faust said student input and the recent conversations about race on campus demand nuanced evaluation and consideration.
“I think we need to be aware of language, actions that threaten, that undermine, that demean,” she said. “At the same time we want to create graduates who are resilient and ready for a world in which safety is not guaranteed outside these walls. So how do we build a place that is safe enough to create resilience but demands enough resilience so as not to require special provisions of safety in the long term?”
“I think it’s a tension that we’re going to just have to keep working on,” she added.

A group of Harvard students helped draft legislation, which, if passed by the Massachusetts state legislature, would expand civil protections and counseling to victims of sexual assault.
The 14-page bill specifically calls on the state to provide sexual assault victims a number of resources: tracking information for rape kits to prevent their misplacement or destruction; specialized counselors for victims of sexual assault; and clear information on a victim’s rights to pursue legal action.
Fran F. Swanson ’17, the statewide director for Rise—an advocacy group against sexual assault that also sponsored a similar federal bill— said the group of Harvard students used research from Harvard Law School students and scholars at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Institute of Politics when drafting the Mass. bill.
The group also solicited testimony from Harvard undergraduates; in an email over the Harvard College International Women’s Rights Collective’s list, Brianna J. Suslovic ’16 publicized the bill and asked interested students to submit responses.
On Jan. 13, when the Massachusetts statehouse heard the bill, some Harvard affiliates and  undergraduates submitted testimonies, according to Swanson. Former gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley submitted an op-ed in the Boston Herald supporting the bill, writing that she was planning to visit the statehouse to “testify on an issue that I am passionate about: justice for survivors of sexual assault.”
Amanda N. Nguyen ’13, a founder of Rise, said there is a “silence” surrounding the issue of sexual violence, adding that victims of sexual assault and police rarely speak about the crime. Bills such as Rise’s Mass. legislation, Nguyen said, are designed to ensure that how law enforcement responds to sexual assault “doesn’t depend on geography.”
Nguyen said she decided to create the bill in 2014 after noticing what she considered discrepancies in states’ responses to sexual assault. In Massachusetts, labs must generally retain rape kits for up to  six months, although the victims may file legal charges long after— for up to 15 years after any crime.
Nguyen said she researched sexual harassment laws after she said she was assaulted while a student at the College.
“I started researching what rights I had, and I tapped heavily into the Harvard network,” Nguyen said, adding that she contacted her professors, colleagues, and friends at Harvard while researching.
Locally, Harvard has faced rampant criticism over how it handles and prevents sexual assault. In 2014, the government found the Law School in violation of the federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX; a separate probe into the College’s compliance is ongoing. Last fall, the Law School unveiled a new set of Title IX procedures for handling sexual assault that broke from a newly-created University-wide model.
University President Drew G. Faust also called results of recent sexual climate survey “deeply disturbing”; the survey found about a third of senior female undergraduate respondents had experienced some kind of sexual assault during their time at Harvard.  As the term drew to a close, dozens of undergraduates rallied outside of Mass. Hall, calling on College administrators allocate more resources towards sexual assault prevention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two subcommittees of the Harvard Corporation tasked with determining Harvard’s shareholder position as a major investor called on several companies to disclose more about their political contributions —among other proposals—according to the 2015 Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility annual report released last week.
An institutional investor in a wide-ranging array of companies, the University relies on the annual recommendations of the two subcommittees to determine how Harvard votes as a stakeholder on a number of social and ethical shareholder proposals facing those companies. At $37.6 billion, Harvard boasts the largest endowment of any institution in higher education.
In 2015, the two committees—the corporation committee, which consists of four members of the Corporation, and the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, a 12-member panel of students, faculty, and alumni—voted on 54 proposals. They considered lobbying activity at JPMorgan Chase, the prevalence of genetically modified organisms at McDonald’s, and fracking practices at Chevron.
The advisory committee first considers each proposal and presents its recommendation to the corporation committee, whose four members cast the final votes to determine Harvard’s position. In 2015, the members of the corporation committee included Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75, Corporation fellow Nannerl O. Keohane, and Corporation fellow Jessica T. Mathews ’67. Harvard Business School Professor Carliss Y. Baldwin served as the chair of the advisory committee; the other members of that committee were not included in the report.
As it did last year, the corporation committee again voted in favor of all 22 proposals—about 40 percent of all considered—advocating companies to disclose information on direct and indirect political spending and lobbying practices. As in past years, the corporate committee noted that proposals about corporate political activity have increased since the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court Ruling in 2010, when the Court voted to end many restrictions on independent corporate political contributions.
The Corporation also voted against shareholder proposals that would ask General Electric and Intel to adopt the “Holy Land Principles”—guidelines designed to prevent employment discrimination against Arab Israelis in their offices based in Israel. For Intel, the advisory committee noted  its existing commitment to “strong global principles and policies on discrimination,” and argued that GE’s employment practices were also modeled on accepted principles.
“Members questioned whether it would be in the best interests of shareholders or the company to impose what appears to be a redundant set of employment principles on Intel,” the report states.
A new proposal for eBay addressed a gender wage gap in the technology industry, with the corporation committee voting to urge eBay to prepare a report on its pay parity efforts for women.
In the wake of widespread outrage over price gouging in the prescription drug market, the Corporation voted to abstain on a proposal that would ask biotechnology firm Gilead Sciences to address concerns about the rising prices of specialty medications. The advisory committee found the proposal “ineffective,” writing that the profits on “blockbuster” drugs subsidize the costs of those drugs in developing countries and fund critical research and development.
In a year when students and activists calling for Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies occupied and blockaded Massachusetts Hall, which houses University President Drew G. Faust’s office and other top Harvard leaders, the CCSR considered several proposals concerning the environment.
The corporation committee voted to call for the Southern Company to adopt goals for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, writing that the Georgia-based utility company “appears to be lagging behind its peers” in reducing its carbon footprint. Still, the corporation committee abstained from voting on a proposal asking similar demands of Chevron, citing the energy giant’s existing commitment to such goals.
The Corporation subcommittee did vote for a Chevron shareholder proposal that requires the company to report on its efforts “to minimize the adverse water resource and community impacts from the company’s hydraulic fracturing operations associated with shale formations.”
“Committee members voiced support for pursuing shareholder engagement to press for environmental responsibility and for encouraging Chevron to approach fracking with a strong emphasis on safety and the avoidance of reputational, environmental, and litigation risks,” the report reads.
The corporation committee also voted in favor of requesting that chemical company DuPont prepare a report on its use of herbicide-resistant crop seeds, which have spawned herbicide resistant “monster weeds,” but rejected a proposal that would have asked PepsiCo to investigate the effects of its pesticide use on the “well-documented and widespread ‘bee colony collapse’ phenomenon.”
McDonald’s was the subject of three proposals, with the corporation committee rejecting two that would ask the fast food titan to “be more proactive in educating the American people about the health and environmental benefits of [genetically modified] ingredients” and report on the congruency of its political contributions with its corporate values. The committee approved one resolution calling for McDonald’s to publish information on the impact of its palm oil supply chain on tropical deforestation and human rights.
Other proposals considered issues including Verizon’s commitment to net neutrality and plant closures by DuPont.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the most critical games of its season, the No. RV/9 Harvard women’s ice hockey squad (10-6-1, 7-5-1 ECAC)  plays hosts to No. 1/1 Boston College (23-0-0, 16-0-0 Hockey East) at Bright-Landry, looking to break the Eagles prolific winning streak as well as its own two game losing streak.
The Crimson was the last team to defeat BC, knocking them out of the Frozen Four with a 2-1 victory in the national semifinals. Since then, the Eagles have won 23 straight contests.
BC will head into Cambridge with revenge in mind. After trouncing Harvard by a score of 10-2 in their first matchup of the season last year, the Crimson walked away with one-goal victories when they faced off in the Beanpot and Frozen Four, leaving the Eagles–who were ranked in the top two in both occasions–empty-handed at the end of the season.
Senior forwards Alex Carpenter and Haley Skarupa–who are ranked second and third in the nation in total points, respectively–will lead a talented Eagle attack that will test a shaky Harvard backline.
Crimson captain Emerance Maschmeyer, who holds the record for most saves in Harvard history, anchors a defense which conceded seven goals in the last two games. After holding a sub-1 goals-against-average early on in the season, the senior goalkeeper’s average has ballooned to nearly two goals allowed per game while her save percentage has dropped to 0.944.
On the offensive side, a Crimson unit struggling with consistency will attempt to make its way past BC sophomore goalkeeper Katie Burt and the third best scoring defense in the nation.
After scoring three or more goals in eight of its first 12 games, Harvard has scored more than two goals on one just occasion in the last six games­–a 6-2 beat down of Colgate. During thw six-game stretch, the Crimson has posted a paltry 2-4-0 record.
Senior Miye D’Oench–who ranks 15th in the nation with 22 points through 17 games–will need to provide a spark for the 14th ranked scoring offense in the nation. The Harvard attack will need to fire on all cylinders to break down an impressive BC defense that has conceded more than two goals only three times this season and boasts a 93.6 percent kill rate on the power play.
In addition to claiming local bragging rights, this game could go a long way in the Crimson’s chances of returning to the postseason for the fourth year in a row. The BC matchup kicks off a tough stretch of four ranked opponents in five games for Harvard–including another matchup with the Eagles in the first round of the Beanpot on Feb. 2nd.
After falling to Clarkson this weekend, Harvard finds itself on the outside looking in; the PairWise rankings, which are an accurate prediction of where a team ranks by the NCAA Tournament committee’s standards, has the Crimson ranked 11th.
With only eight teams making the tournament and the threat that a low-ranked team could steal a spot by winning a conference title, a victory against BC would go a long way in helping the Crimson secure a place in the top eight. A loss against the Eagles could force Harvard to have to play near-perfect hockey and/or win the ECAC postseason title against the likes of Princeton, Quinnipiac, and Clarkson–top-eight ranked teams the Crimson has failed to defeat so far this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the New Year’s high of downing Penn and Princeton, the No. 5 Harvard men’s team (2-2, 2-1 Ivy League) dropped a home game against No. 6 St. Lawrence (6-2, 0-1 Liberty League) Monday at home. Meanwhile, the No. 1 women’s team (5-0, 3-0) continued its sweep streak and won all nine matches against the Saints women’s team (2-8, 0-0).
The men’s team looked to avenge last year’s CSA semifinals loss against a strong opponent in St. Lawrence yesterday. St. Lawrence, coming off a recent loss against Yale, looked to bounce back in its fourth game in six days. Despite the loaded schedule, the Saints were able to pull through and defeat the Crimson, 5-4.
All of the matches were extremely close, with most of the matches being played to more than three games. The top flight of Crimson players all lost, with junior co-captain Bryan Koh and sophomore Bradley Smith dropping their first matches of the season.
Koh dropped the first two games 11-13 to St. Lawrence’s Ahmed Bayoumy at the third position. He forged a comeback with an 11-6 win in the third game, but ultimately lost the fourth game 6-11.
Smith faced Moustafa Bayoumy in the second position. The Smith-Bayoumy matchup was one of three on the day that went to five games. After dropping the first game, Smith rebounded to take the next two games, but fell 8-12 in the fifth game.
In the No. 1 position, sophomore David Ryan was held to just 12 points combined in his 3-0 loss to Amr Khaled Khalifa.
Harvard’s second flight had better luck, with junior co-captain Devin McLaughlin sweeping George Willis 11-3, 12-10, 11-7 at the No. 5 spot. Freshman Alexi Gosset continued his win streak for the Crimson with a 3-1 win in the sixth spot. Junior Dylan Murray lost 3-1 at the No. 4 spot.
Freshman Seif Eleinen and sophomore Mandela Patrick won the Crimson’s other matches, with Eleinen sweeping his opponent in the No. 7 spot, and Patrick besting his opponent in five games in the ninth position. Freshman Jack Cooper was unable to defeat St. Lawrence’s Ness Billimoria, losing 3-2 in the eighth spot.
Meanwhile, the women swept St. Lawrence, 9-0. The team came in with momentum after convincing wins against Ivy opponents last weekend.
“I think we try to play all our matches with the same preparation and intensity.” senior Michelle Gemmell said. “Even though this team is lower ranked I think we've always respected our opponents enough to not take anything less seriously.”
In this win, each Crimson player swept her opponent and held her to under 10 points a game, giving the team a 27-0 game score.
“I thought the entire team played really well as a whole, no one dropped a game,” sophomore Sue Ann Yong said.
There were several firsts for the team yesterday. Sophomore Alyssa Mehta’s victory over Jillian Baker marked her first win in the top position, while juniors Keegan Mendez and Katherine Tutrone, co-captain Saumya Karki and senior Isabelle Dowling also earned their first victories at their respective spots.
Gemmell and juniors Caroline Monrad and Dileas MacGowan all extended their undefeated streaks with their wins at the third, fourth, and seventh, and positions respectively.
After missing last season, senior Alexandra Sperry made her return to the courts in convincing fashion, easily handling Valeria Quan for a 3-0 win at the No. 9 spot.
This win is the Crimson women’s fourth 9-0 sweep of an opponent this season.
“With only a month left in the season, I think our team will come together in the end and hopefully continue the momentum we have built up over the past couple weeks,” Gemmell said. “It's always a really exciting time and I think our team is in a really good place. At this point in the season it's all about staying the same and giving it your all on match day!”
