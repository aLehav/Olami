It’s day four of the Harvard College Film Festival, and in a classroom tucked away in Boylston Hall, cinephiles eagerly line up for a chance to strap on a clunky headset to experience a simulated environment. This virtual reality is also used to create a version of David Karlak’s sci-fi opus “RISE,” where androids—beatific faces on bare metal bodies—can be seen from an up-close vantage point that only underscores their secure placement in the uncanny valley. This novel cinematic episode is one of many delights that festival-goers can enjoy, but these unique experiences represent only the tip of all that the Harvard College Film Festival has to offer lovers of film at Harvard and beyond.
The HCFF is a celebration of all things cinematic, featuring screenings of a wide variety of films—from student-submitted entries to the works of established independent filmmakers—in a wide swath of categories. Entries include documentaries, experimental films, traditional fiction, and even short films under five minutes in length. The event also features numerous conversations with directors, actors, producers, and other prominent industry figures. The HCFF has grown remarkably over its brief lifespan, and its explosive expansion underscores the organization’s potential to serve as a focal point and forum for discussion among film-makers and film aficionados alike.
The rise of the HCFF has been nothing short of meteoric. Established a mere three years ago, the festival has grown at a staggering rate. This year’s iteration, which ran from March 30 to April 3, received over three times as many submissions as were received in the previous years, and its events have grown a great deal in number and variety since its founding. This year, the festival featured an all-star judging panel that was composed largely of professors and included a former New York Film Festival director and a few award-winning filmmakers. “It’s definitely palpable that the festival is expanding,” said Auguste J. Roc ’17, co-director of the HCFF. “I think this is the first year that we’re becoming sort of a presence on campus.”
The festival’s origins are humble. Its original staff was a smal 10-man group, largely culled from the inactive Harvard University TV organization. “HUTV was supposed to be the entertainment club, and film fell under that category,” HCFF founder Nicole R. Delany ’14 said. “Many of the members of HUTV plus others helped to create the festival, so we already had the infrastructure from a practical standpoint.”
The HCFF’s growth is attributable in part to the momentum generated by its efforts in previous years. “It’s kind of a funny system: People generally respect a film festival more if it has more submissions,” said Isaac Siegemund-Broka ’17, co-directior of the HCFF. “And so being able to publicize the amount of submissions we had last year helped us get more this year.”

The prestige associated with Harvard’s brand also encourages participation. "I found [the festival] through Withoutabox.com and I saw Harvard and I was like let's go," said NYU math major Colm Dillane, whose Claymation film “Mercury Rising” won best super-short film at this year’s festival.
Indeed, from its inception, the film festival has remained aware of its connection to the University. “What makes the HCFF different is that we can play in the name of Harvard.” Delany said. “Everyone knows the name, and it's a great draw for people to submit if they can get [their film] at Harvard.”
The Harvard brand shapes the festival in subtle ways; its influence can be seen in the composition of the judges’ panel. “We were kind of like, ‘Let’s work on our strengths as a festival,’ and we wanted to have a very intentional panel of judges,” Roc said. “And so we thought, ‘Okay, we’re at Harvard, our strong suit is that we kind of have this academic angle,’ and so most of our judges are professors. But they all look at film through an academic lens as well as a professional lens. That’s something I think is really cool and that typifies the festival.”
It shouldn’t be assumed that Harvard entrants dominate the festival. According to the HCFF co-directors, a sizeable portion of this year’s submissions come from outside Harvard. In fact, the HCFF this year expanded its horizons to the international film scene, for the first time accepting submissions from countries outside the United States, including Nepal, Bulgaria, and Mexico, to name a few.
The established factors of momentum and a Harvard affiliation, however, cannot solely account for the rapid growth of the festival. The HCFF team’s efforts were instrumental in contributing to the festival’s vitality and in cementing the festival as a distinct institution with its own unique footprint. “From the second year to the third year, we spent a lot of time defining the identity of the festival and what we were trying to accomplish, the events we wanted to have, the conversations we wanted to foster,” Roc said.
This year’s push to solidify the festival’s presence can be seen in the great number of external connections the staff has made to help bolster and legitimize the festival. “One way in which we’ve expanded is in working with the Harvard Art Museums,” Roc said. “They’re really interested in making the Harvard Art Museums also a hub for film, and so they’ve been extremely supportive in housing the festival during a couple of our events…. It’s been a really great partnership.” The staff have also made contact with independent film distributors, including A24 and Broad Green, and the companies’ support has enabled the HCFF to show films from outside Harvard undergraduates.

To further broaden its audience, the HCFF has also dabbled in hosting non-festival events. On March 4, the organization, working with the Harvard College Women’s Center, hosted a panel discussing recent challenges and successes for women in the film industry. The event appealed to both for lovers of film and for those interested in larger issues of gender, fostering contact between the communities.
But perhaps the most tangible, quantifiable success of this year’s festival has been the sheer increase in the number of entries. This year’s staff went to great lengths to solicit submissions, often using nontraditional, more assertive methods; according to the co-directors, the HCFF contacted film schools, professors in film departments, and even student newspapers in an effort to reach prospective entrants. “I would say that this is kind of the first year we’re really going hard on the pubbing efforts,” said Lindsay Bu ’18, the HCFF marketing chair.
This proactive approach to finding films—of actively soliciting films through avenues that don’t cater exclusively to established filmmakers—underscores an integral part of the HCFF’s larger mission: to broadcast the stellar work of students who might otherwise lack a platform for their creations and thus to help them gain recognition for their innovations and efforts.
This inclusionary impulse is evident in the the very structure of the festival: It is, after all, only open to college undergraduates in order to prevent their entries from being crowded out by those of more established filmmakers. “We state very directly on our submission materials that we only accept undergraduate content—we still got grad students, professionals,” Siegemund-Broka said. “So there was definitely a process there of weeding out what was not within our scope.”

But it’s also visible in even the smallest details of the festival’s operation, such as the process by which filmmakers submit their films to the festival. Instead of relying solely, as the HCFF had done in previous years, on the platform Withoutabox, which is the industry-standard medium for entering films into festivals, this year’s staff employed the humble Google form as an alternate method of entry into the festival. “If you don’t already have a Withoutabox profile it can take a lot of time and energy to create one, so we use the Google form so people who might be new to student filmmaking can still participate,” Siegemund-Broka said.
This care and willingness to encourage new filmmakers extends to the festival’s selection process. The process of culling submissions is necessarily somewhat harsh, but the HCFF staff took pains to make sure that all eligible films were given a fair look. Due to the increased volume of entries to this year’s festival, the HCFF staff had to vet the submissions before passing them onto the judges. “We really wanted the judges to enjoy their experience, to feel that they were able to contribute to something cool but that it wasn’t an overwhelming burden on their time,” Siegemund-Broka said.
To select the winning films, the HCFF staff divided themselves into four groups, each of which was assigned a particular genre of film. Each group member gave the film a score from one to 10; the HCFF staff used an average of these scores was to determine which films made it to the judging panel. “We tried to be as inclusive as possible, to send as many of the best films as possible, over to our judges,” said Hugh A. Mayo ’18, the HCFF submissions chair.
Though the all-star judging panel may seem intimidating at first glance, it also ties into the HCFF’s goal of encouraging budding filmmakers. “We really wanted to make sure that the judges were a group of people that a student who wins an award can look at and say ‘Wow, these people like my film and that means something,’” Siegemund-Broka said.
Dillane’s experience confirms the validating effect that a renowned judging panel can have on submitters. “As a winner, I feel more confident now. I should do this more often,” Dillane said.
The mission of the HCFF, however, extends beyond the celebration and cultivation of undergraduate filmmakers; on a larger scale, the festival seeks to provide a student-driven hub for Harvard’s appreciators of film, content-creators or otherwise. “There’s not really a strong extracurricular film community,” Roc said. “There’s a definitely a strong film community on campus, I think, but it’s very centered around academics.” Although there are student organizations devoted to film, such as the Harvard College Society for the Cinematic Arts, many of these are relatively new, and haven’t yet established themselves as dominant forces on campus.
The HCFF’s ambition to appeal to film-lovers of all types can be seen in the sheer variety of its events, which include screenings of both submissions and external independent films, alongside a variety of conversations with directors, producers, and actors. There are industry panel geared towards more avid filmmakers, but there are also panels that appeal to a broader base of cinephiles. At the HCFF screening of his week-old proof of concept film “RISE,” Karlak discussed topics ranging from the potential role of robots in a futuristic society to the development of novel technologies such as virtual reality—a discussion enabled and rendered cohesive by its ties to the medium of film. “You have people coming together under a common interest; a lot of good can come from that,” Karlak said.

The non-festival events run by the organizers of HCFF, such as the previously mentioned Women in the Film Industry panel, are also effective methods for enlarging the scope of the film community at Harvard; they connect the HCFF to communities that might not have an overt interest in film. “I think those sort of events that we have are a good way to make people who might not be interested in Film with a capital F more likely to come to these events in the future,” Bu said.
However, the HCFF is still slightly wary of venturing too boldly away from what is ultimately the crux of its operation: the festival itself. “Something that was really important to us was reaching out to other communities and creating cross-sections of conversations with other communities on campus. I think with the second year we tried to do that too soon, without knowing who we were, and I think this year we spent a lot of time focusing on what we were doing,” Roc said. “But in the future, I’d be interested in seeing how [outreach events] develop.”
Still, given the festival’s prodigious pattern of growth, it’s easy to see the HCFF increasing its scope. The festival has made great strides in a mere three years and done much in the name of fostering a community of cinephiles both at Harvard and beyond. The progress made by the festival in so short a time indicates this young organization’s massive potential for expansion, both in terms of the organization’s role on campus and in the festival itself. “I wouldn’t say we’re there or where we want to be because [we all] have really big visions of what the festival could be in five years’ time,” Roc said.

Nevertheless, this farsighted perspective isn’t incompatible with a certain pride in the accomplishments of this year’s festival. “What started as a couple of hours in one room on campus has, over the last two years, been expanded into the event it is today: a five-day festival featuring seven hours of student films; four professionally produced films; four Q&A sessions with directors, actors, and producers; a virtual reality experience; and the panel discussion that you will see today,” Roc said in a speech in Menschel Hall after the screening of selected student films. Given the HCFF’s commitment to the the art of storytelling, it’s only fitting that the festival’s otherworldly rise seems itself drawn from the pages of a script.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s something revolutionary happening at the Loeb this week: BlackC.A.S.T.’s “Black Magic.” When else have audiences at the Loeb Mainstage been treated to the sounds of Rihanna’s new album, a cheeky spin on the trope of the “black table” in the cafeteria, and multiple representations of queer couples of color, all in one production?
With a cast comprised entirely of black students and a production team comprised primarily of people of color, “Black Magic” shakes up the theater scene at Harvard simply by existing. In a predominantly white theater culture where black actors and characters are often only present in BlackC.A.S.T. productions, getting a show centered around the experiences of people of color onto the Loeb Mainstage is a radical feat in and of itself.
Think about the face of theater at Harvard—that face is probably white. On a campus where people of color often go unseen onstage, “Black Magic” represents a reclaiming of narrative and creative capacity, proving that black and brown students can and do create dramatic art worthy of our attention. The norms of Harvard theater restrictively dictate where and how actors and characters of color can exist; as unintentional as it may be, the theater community at Harvard oversamples and over-represents whiteness.
Though people of color do participate in Harvard’s theater scene, theater can nevertheless be an alienating experience for students of color who aren’t sure whether shows will feature people who look like them onstage. After all, each semester, the Harvard undergraduate theater world produces a barrage of high-quality plays and musicals that are severely lacking in terms of diversity onstage. “Black Magic” is a direct response to these predominantly white norms.
The most norm-shattering aspect of the show lies in its honest portrayal of the black community on campus—not as a monolith or singular force but instead as a diverse array of experiences, opinions, and emotions. “Black Magic” chronicles the lives of fictional students Amari, Eli, CJ, Syd, and Anika, interspersing their narratives with conversational episodes from “The Black Table,” five students who sit at a dining hall table underneath portraits of the white men of Harvard.
Through these glimpses of life at Harvard, the play illustrates the trying moments that black students experience on a day-to-day basis attending this predominantly white institution. There is no overarching crisis or conflict other than the struggle of living in a society where black people are brutally killed and their white killers often go unpunished. In the play, morning routines are set to the backdrop of images of Black Lives Matter protests and a sound-byte of a reporter claiming that “there just wasn’t enough evidence” to convict the killer of Eric Garner; a writer for the school newspaper is badgered by white members of the newspaper staff to lead the “diversity committee”; members of “The Black Table” describing their frustrating experiences with a diversity dean who can’t tell students of color apart.
Additionally, “Black Magic” shines as a more accurate depiction of queer black life—one that humanizes them through themes of acceptance and struggle, in contrast to the usual tragic representation of queer people of color on stage. One character comfortably uses gender neutral pronouns whereas another struggles to avoid outing himself to family. In this way, “Black Magic” affords its queer characters the same dignity that is granted to white queer characters. It recognizes the ways that blackness and queerness often interact positively instead of falling into incorrect, misleading tropes about homophobia in the black community.
At its core, though, “Black Magic” challenges its audience to be self-critical, to think about the ways that we do or don’t affirm black students on this campus. It functions as a biting critique of our peers, our organizations, and our administration, by pushing the narrative beyond “dialogue” and “diversity” towards a gospel of black self-love.
In "Black Looks: Race and Representation," feminist theorist and cultural critic bell hooks writes, “We cannot value ourselves rightly without first breaking through the walls of denial which hide the depth of black self-hatred, inner anguish, and unreconciled pain.” The play certainly grapples with questions of black love—it is an artistic creation by and for black people at Harvard. As director Kimiko Matsuda-Lawrence writes in the program, “we wrote this play for ourselves.”
The effects of uplifting people of color as actors, crew, and characters cannot be underscored enough. This production proves that black narratives are nuanced, compelling, and worth theatrical exploration. This is an inherently political act: To claim Harvard’s theater space, to implicate students and administrators in the reality-based narrative, and to represent black voices of Harvard.
However, the intentionality of this vision should not deter non-black audiences. To the contrary, all members of the campus community have something to learn from this production, whether that lesson lies in eliminating complicity or initiating resistance. This week’s revolutionary all-black theatrical experience of “Black Magic” encourages us to imagine Harvard at its most inclusive. “Black Magic” politicizes the Loeb Mainstage through imaginings of black joy, black love, and, most notably, black humanity at Harvard.

“Calm down so we can discuss this like adults.”
Today’s social activists are quick to call out the seductive, siren’s call appeal of this specious argument. Tone policing, they claim, unfairly discounts the substance of an argument because of its presentation and prioritizes civility over truth. In his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” Martin Luther King faults not just the Ku Klux Klan member, but the “white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than justice.”
Their underlying point is correct: One can simultaneously be angry and rational. The elusiveness of this point perhaps explains our inability to slow down the Trump machine. Since his arrival in the political arena, the conservative intelligentsia was quick to criticize not only him, but also the movement he stands for. They confused the anger of Trump supporters for irrationality, which only made them angrier.
As vapid as you might consider them, it’s hard to make a case that their decision to vote for Trump is unsystematic and not thoughtful. Trump has outlined a fairly clear, albeit generally unpalatable platform for his presidency—a wall across the border, a freeze on funding to Planned Parenthood, a ban on refugees—that is in line with the views of his voter base.
His supporters are putting justice—or at least their conception of it—over order. In their eyes, the RINOs who consider any support for Trump as indefensible ipso facto fall prey to the establishment’s guile of civility, baited by rhetoric that sounds polite or politically correct at the expense of a truth that may be hard to swallow.
It’s unfair to dismiss both the feminist, whose anger at the patriarchy is integral to her argument, and the Trumpist, whose fear of Muslim immigrants cannot be dismissed solely on face value.
But where the fight against tone policing gets it wrong is that it still does not view argumentation as the most effective means to resolution. The best case for condemning tone policing is that discussion can be both rational and emotional—that arguments should be considered on merits, not decorum. But the case that often gets made instead is that, in scenarios where injustice is great, discussion can be simply emotional or eschewed altogether for unilateral claims to the truth.
A seminal piece on tone policing circulated widely and often online—a comic by the blog Every Day Feminism—characterizes the tactic as an exercise of privilege, a plausibly justifiable assertion, but uses this claim to attack open dialogue as a methodological approach to truth-finding. “Some topics,” the comic claims, “don’t have two [or three, or four] equal sides, and some viewpoints don’t have to be met neutrally.” The graphic below this text depicts a woman asking to debate on transgender identities, to which another replies pithily, “Let’s not.”
It’s important to be critical of systematic approaches to problems. Yet one whose reliability has withstood the test of time is the application of the competition of ideas. If ideas can never be totally proven to be correct and thus should compete for popular appeal and the claim to truth, then we should have the maturity and foresight to recognize emotion as a tool that can sometimes aid, sometimes distract from, but never replace reason. That means resisting temptations to dismiss the credibility of a claim because of the person touting it. It means taking the concerns and arguments of the Trumpist and feminist with the same critical gravity.
But don’t for a second allow anyone to exploit these problems with tone policing to forego discussion altogether. Unfettered discussion will always be truth’s most rigorous trial, a scary reality for those after something less akin to truth and more to their interpretation of justice. Justice is always more important than order, but do not let the least orderly dictate the standards for justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 7, 2016, at 11:24 p.m.
Issues of racial diversity and inclusion in higher education have become some of the most urgent, important, and divisive topics on college campuses today. These critical conversations rightly touch on nearly every aspect of students’ educational experiences, but at Ivy League schools like Harvard, issues of institutional history have been particularly salient. Some activists have called for the renaming of buildings like Mather House or symbols like the Law School shield because of their association with slaveholders.
In this environment, President Faust was joined by Georgia Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis on Wednesday to unveil a plaque outside Wadsworth House to four slaves—Titus, Venus, Juba, and Bilhah—who had worked there in the 1700s. As she put it in a Crimson op-ed announcing the plaque, “In more fully acknowledging our history, Harvard must do its part to undermine the legacies of race and slavery that continue to divide our nation.”
These issues are tough, and the conversations they prompt are not easy. Reasonable people may disagree on the best way to proceed. At the Law School, Annette Gordon-Reed, one of America’s foremost scholars on slavery, dissented from a committee report advocating for the removal of the Law School crest. In the past, we have disagreed with name or seal changes. There is legitimate scholarship on both sides of this issue, and we must have these debates in a thoughtful way.
When we can cut through that divisiveness, however, we should always seek to do so. Simply put, placing this plaque is a good idea. Here, we have an opportunity to recognize the sins of history without concern that we are erasing the past. As a community, we are able to become more aware of how our ancestors erred and thus how we might seek a better path.
Harvard was nearly 150 years old when it witnessed the birth of this country. Since then, it has been present for the successes and celebrations but also the trials and tribulations. As students, we treasure this American story when we remember our alumni and our history, but we must also tell that story honestly and in full. It would do a disservice to ourselves and to our history to leave out the parts that are intertwined with our nation’s original sin.
Some Harvard students have lived in buildings in which slaves once labored. That should shock us with the sobering reality of history. Of course, it is not all just history: we continue to struggle with the legacies of slavery and racial discrimination to this day. The reason President Faust recently unveiled a portrait of the late Reverend Peter Gomes—the first portrait of a person of color to hang in University Hall—is to remind us of our often-halting progress on issues of inclusion.
We know that the installation of this plaque will neither solve the problems of race nor immediately ameliorate the lives of minority students at Harvard. It is easy to declare this a public relations sham or to deride it as a meek effort of appeasement. We deeply hope, and optimistically believe, that that is not so. We see this as merely one small step in a broader effort to make progress on a difficult issue.
As long as the legacy of slavery plagues our campus and our nation, we will and must continue to have tough discussions. We may not always agree with all the demands of activists, but we are glad to live on a campus with them. They animate campus discussion, rightly forcing us to grapple with our tragic past and present.
For as much as we have regard for Harvard, the highest form of that regard is to understand our roots. Learning the lessons of history is not a dirty task; informing ourselves of where we have sinned is the only way to forge a different future. In the midst of these oft acrimonious conversations, Wednesday’s ceremony was an opportunity to come together for a moment as a community.
Congressman Lewis said at the unveiling that the plaque represented “the distance we’ve come and the progress we’ve made [but] that we must never ever forget our past.” Surely we can all agree that we have come far, and yet still have so far left to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of freshmen crowded Annenberg Hall to enjoy an assortment of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries during Tuesday’s Brain Break, but some were left with just sour grapes.
The event, part of this week’s Freshman Health Project, was originally the result of a contentious vote on Sunday by the UC to spend $850 to fund the berries. After learning of the proposal, a nutrition professor at the School of Public Health volunteered to have his department sponsor the event.
Ivy Yard Representative Scott Xiao ’19 said the event proved particularly popular, with students lining across Annenberg Hall to consume the fresh fruit. Students arrived before the event began, and quickly gathered around the berry station as soon as the doors opened.
“There were a bunch of people who took two bowls so that they could get as many berries as they could,” Catherine Y. Zhang  ’19 said. “I’m pretty sure there were some people who brought tupperware.”
For some, however, the brain break was a fruitless endeavor. According to Xiao, though the event was scheduled to last from 9:15 p.m. to 11:15 p.m., all the berries had been consumed by 9:40.
Katie C. Berry ’19 was one of many students who arrived after all of the berries had disappeared, and said she was “devastated.”
“I was looking forward to having some berries, but there was nothing for me,” Berry said.
Overall, many students said they were pleased with the brain break, and the berries in particular.
“I think Berry Brain Break was a great bonding experience, and brought some laughs to a stressful midterm environment,” Zhang said.
Still, others said they wished healthier food options were available more frequently.
“I wish there was a more sustainable solution for students to get berries as opposed to one day for one hour,” Deepika S. Kurup ’19 said.
Several UC representatives expressed surprise over the event’s popularity, given that initially, many Council members worried the decision to fund the brain break would be controversial.
Oak Yard Representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 voted against the legislation to fund the berries during the UC’s Sunday general meeting, but said that he changed his mind about the value of the event.
“I now think I voted wrongly,” Boucher said. “That brain break was probably one of our most attended events.”
Pforzheimer House Representative Neel Mehta ’18, who also voted against the legislation, said that although he was pleased by the event’s success, he felt that the money spent could have been used better.
“I still wonder if we could have done it with some cheaper methods than berries,” Mehta said.
The committee is currently exploring possible ways to spend the $850 that they saved due to the grant from the School of Public Health. According to Elm Yard Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19, members of the committee have considered funding game consoles in freshman dorm buildings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the current race to the bottom that is the acceptance rates of elite colleges, Stanford has taken top prize—admitting a lower percentage of applicants than Harvard for the fourth year in a row.
Stanford announced last month that it accepted only 4.69 percent of nearly 44,000 hopefuls who applied to its Class of 2020, according to the Stanford Daily. Harvard accepted 5.2 percent of more than 39,000 applicants.
College admissions professionals speculated the difference could have been due to Stanford’s appeal to international students.
“It’s not that students perceive Harvard as an inferior school in any way to Stanford,” David C. Mainiero, co-founder and director of operations at InGenius Prep, said, citing his personal experience working with applicants from China.
But, according to Mainiero, international students may view Stanford as more connected to innovations in technology and business.
“The allure of Silicon Valley brings a lot more prestige to Stanford,” he said.
“I think that where Stanford finds an advantage against Harvard is that Stanford does a better job marketing itself abroad,” Mainiero added.
Still, some experts cautioned that admissions statistics should be taken with a grain of salt.
“From the outside, it doesn’t look like a material difference in any way to be half a percentage point different,” Anna Ivey, founder of the admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting, said. “Realistically I wouldn’t call it a difference at all. I would call it neck and neck.”
In a recent interview with the Washington Post, Stanford’s Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Richard H. Shaw expressed concern that the public pays too much attention to figures like acceptance rates.
“It just diverts everybody’s attention from the fact that we took 2,000-plus kids that are magnificent,” he told the Post. “My feeling is, what’s the difference between 7 percent and 4 percent? It’s all very competitive. If you look at Harvard’s number, Penn’s, Princeton’s, or any number of institutions, they’re all quite competitive.”
Experts also agreed that while this year’s record-low acceptance rates at both Harvard and Stanford drew public attention, the statistic might not be indicative of the quality of the institutions.
“Even low acceptance rates aren’t necessarily badges of honor,” Ivey said. “It doesn’t tell you anything about the quality of the applicants, because you turned most people away.”
Other metrics could potentially better reflect the schools’ strengths. Mainiero proposed the percentage of admitted students choosing to matriculate as a measurement, also known as the yield. Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions and director of international admissions at the University of Virginia, suggested higher graduation rates signal more robust institutions.
Regardless of the importance of acceptance rates at top universities, some experts agreed that the downward trend of the admittance percentages is unlikely to reverse anytime soon.
Muth cited increased efforts on the part of colleges to recruit potential students, including members of low-income and otherwise underrepresented populations, as a reason for the high number of applicants—and thus the low acceptance rate.
“The acceptance rates are going to continue to drop because schools are doing a good job of publicizing how they do things well that other schools don’t,” he said.
Shaw, Stanford Associate Dean and Director of Admission Colleen Lim, and Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 all declined to comment for this article.

Cambridge City Council waded into broader state and national issues at its meeting this Monday, passing two resolutions—one questioning the Massachusetts State Seal and another admonishing recent North Carolina legislation regarding BGLTQ residents.
One of the resolutions, sponsored by Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons, requests that the Massachusetts State Legislature “review the symbolism of the Official Seal of Massachusetts to determine whether it may be perpetuating or promoting hurtful symbolism.”
“[Constituents] have been urging the Commonwealth to review this matter for quite some time, and they appealed to me for assistance in drawing attention to the matter,” Simmons wrote in an email.
The state seal depicts a Native American person with a bow and arrow underneath a sword surrounded by the Latin words “Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem,” which, according to the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ website, translates to “By the sword we seek peace, but peace only under liberty.”
The request to review the state seal was, in part, influenced by similar actions taken at Harvard Law School in recent months, according to Simmons.
“In light of the fact that the Harvard Law School seal and many other prominent seals, flags, and symbols have come under renewed scrutiny—and in some cases, revisions—in the last few years, the request of these constituents to at least bring this to the attention of the state legislature seemed reasonable to me,” Simmons wrote.
John A. Peters, Jr., executive director of the Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs, said the Commission, which represents Native Americans in Massachusetts, does not find issue with the depiction of the native person alone.
“We’re honored to have a native person, [as the] first person on the seal,” Peters said. “It’s very fitting for Massachusetts, one of the first colonies here in the [in the continental United States], paying tribute to the original peoples of the land.”
Still, Peters said other imagery on the seal posed more of a problem. Peters said the swinging sword over the native’s head is a depiction of an early colonial military adviser.
“What is most inappropriate is the sword over the Indian’s head, with Myles Standish’s sword.” Peters said Standish was “instrumental in a lot of the early deeds that were written, that the native people didn’t understand.”
“The motto is another disturbing concept,” Peters said. “The way we interpret that is... we’re going to liberate your property and possessions and keep the peace by the sword.”
The council also passed a resolution this week sponsored by Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., which bans all taxpayer funded trips to North Carolina. The resolution targets recent legislation in North Carolina that prohibits transgender residents from using bathrooms that do not match their gender on birth certificates and does not mention protections for BGLTQ citizens in an antidiscrimination policy.
The resolution called the North Carolina law “discriminatory legislation against the LGBTQ community” and against the values of the City of Cambridge.
The resolution follows similar actions taken by the Governors of Vermont and New York. Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 said this week that he will not ban state-sponsored travel to the Tar Heel State.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mark C. Elliott, Harvard’s new Vice Provost for International Affairs, is well known across the University for his scholarship in Chinese history. He was appointed the director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies in 2013 and even accompanied University President Drew G. Faust on her trip to Beijing last year.
Because Elliott took the helm from Jorge I. Dominguez, who had strong ties with Latin America, several professors assumed that Elliott would instead prioritize Harvard’s relationship with Asia.
“We thought it would make sense that [he] would then swing over towards Asia to balance things out,” Brian D. Farrell, professor of biology and the director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, said.
However, during his first few months in the role, Elliott has spent much time studying Latin America in order to prepare for his visit to Brazil and Peru this past week. Last fall, immediately after he learned he would visit the region, Elliott called Frances Hagopian, professor for Brazil Studies and faculty chair of the Brazil Studies Program at DRCLAS.
“I asked her to give me a 15-minute primer on Brazil,” he said.  He added that in the months leading up to his visit, he read books on Latin American politics, watched popular films about the region, and even took Portuguese lessons from Brazilian undergraduates.
Elliott timed his first visit to South America as Vice Provost to attend an advisory group meeting of the Brazil Office of DRCLAS. During the meeting, the advisory board—which is composed of both scholars and individuals working in the private sector, both alumni and non-alumni—discussed potential projects and collaborations with Harvard affiliates.
Elliott said the meeting served as an opportunity to introduce himself to the board and learn about various Harvard initiatives in the region, including Harvard’s research on early childhood development and ways to use research to leverage public policy.
“That was one big part of my trip, to get a sense of the people who help make our programs in Brazil, to get some sense of the size of the office and some sense of the city and the problems facing Brazil today,” he said.
Hagopian, who attended the advisory board meeting in Brazil, said Elliott “exceeded [her] expectations.”
“For a historian of China to embrace this role, to embrace South America, is fantastic,” she said.
While in Lima, Elliott visited several branches of Innova, a privately funded Peruvian school system designed as an affordable alternative to public education from kindergarten through high school. He said he plans to meet with the head of Innova schools and the dean of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education over the next few months in the hopes of developing a potential “laboratory” of study for researchers at the GSE.
For Elliott, the trip to Latin America gave him a chance to “sourc[e] opportunities for research in the wider world where Harvard work can help to impact for the better outcomes that matter to us and matter to them.”
The trip even allowed Elliott the opportunity to explore his scholarly interest in East Asian Studies. While in Brazil, Elliott met with Chinese students at the University of Sao Paulo and gained a deeper perspective of Chinese studies in Latin America.
“That was something that opened a lot of doors and made the trip extra interesting for me,” he said. “I was able to get a much better sense of the way people in Brazil looked at China.”

In almost fitting fashion, former Vice President and Nobel Laureate Al Gore ’69 drove from Manhattan after inclement weather cancelled his flight, and arrived only 20 minutes late to deliver his talk, “Confronting The Climate Crisis: Critical Roles for the US and China.”
Attendees said they were excited to hear what Gore had to say about the economics and politics of climate change.
“I admire him enormously, but at the same time I’m stressed [about the] way that climate change has become so politicized in this country,” Blue Magruder, an attendee and director of communications and marketing for the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, said.
The talk, hosted by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in Sanders Theatre, centered around what Gore called three important questions regarding climate change: whether change is necessary, whether change is possible, and whether change will occur.
Gore said that given current trends in temperatures, natural disasters, and atmospheric composition, the answer to these questions is yes.
Gore also emphasized China’s role in the increasing adoption of renewable energy. He said China now produces a third of global wind energy and is rapidly expanding in the photovoltaic industry.
“China has announced the most ambitious renewable goals of practically anybody,” Gore said.
Gore also argued that effecting holistic change requires collaboration across political and ideological lines. He said now is the best time to build sustainable infrastructure, arguing that such ventures would create jobs.
“Is there a better time...to invest in decarbonizing our economy?” Gore asked the audience.
Overall, Gore maintained an optimistic view of global sustainability, asserting that society will ultimately win “the battle” against climate change.
“The movement to rooftop-based and utility scale photovoltaics is the future, supplemented by wind, supplemented by batteries, accelerated by the variety of efficiency improvements,” he said.
Catlin Powers, CEO of One Earth Designs and a research fellow at the School of Public Health, said she enjoyed the talk, but said there are still questionsover how to best combat climate change.
“We have some good solutions out there, but we need to address technical challenges in energy storage and we also need better, faster ways of scaling successful solutions,” Powers said.

At 4:34 p.m. on Thursday afternoon, the Allston Campus Express shuttle picked up five passengers behind Harvard’s Memorial Hall, and embarked on an odyssey that bears witness to Harvard’s recent expansion into Allston.
The Allston Campus Express, which debuted in 2012, passes the Law School, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Memorial Hall, and Lamont Library before reaching its Allston stops. At the corner of DeWolfe and Cowperthwaite Street, the driver lets a couple Leverett House residents hop from the vehicle before it crosses the Charles River into Allston.
In Allston, the mostly-empty shuttle wended its way between barren lots on Western Avenue. To the left, laid the sites of Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus and the future SEAS complex, where two thirds of SEAS faculty are slated to move by 2020. To the right, the Harvard Innovation Lab sprawls beside the plot which will soon house the Harvard Life Lab, a biotech research facility.
Harvard’s broader plan for Allston goes beyond these three projects, including a basketball venue, hotel and conference center, and a residential and retail complex centered around Barry’s Corner, at the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avnue in Allston.
Among the most frequent undergraduate shuttle riders are athletes, who practice at Harvard’s Allston athletic facilities. Harvard football team member Noah Reimers ’19, who described himself as a loyal shuttle patron, was riding the bus to retrieve a forgotten key from his football locker in Allston.
“It’s usually not very crowded,” Reimers said of the shuttle.
Despite what some passengers called limited usage of the Allston shuttle services, Harvard Spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke said administrators are in the planning stages of addressing new transportation needs as Harvard moves into Allston.
In order to afford students time to cross the river and reach their SEAS classes, Harvard administrators have presented a plan to cut the unofficial seven-minute grace period between Harvard classes known as “Harvard Time.” In its place, the plan seeks to stagger classes, providing a larger transit window.
In addition to the Allston Campus Express Shuttle, Harvard debuted a Barry’s Corner shuttle in December 2015, which runs between Harvard Square and some of Harvard’s properties in Allston.
Farid Nemri, an Extension School student and frequent shuttle patron, said the Allston shuttle seems especially empty when compared to shuttles destined for the Radcliffe Quadrangle, which features Houses with popular social spaces.
Past Harvard plans for Allston have suggested that Harvard move its three Quad residential Houses across the river to Allston, shifting the center of campus from historic Harvard Yard to the Charles River. These plans have gone largely unmentioned since President Lawrence H. Summers left Massachusetts Hall in 2006.
At 5:20 p.m., in a flurry of crimson and black, 25 students boarded the bus outside Harvard Stadium, their backpacks emblazoned with Harvard soccer, softball, and tennis logos. For the first time, the bus was filled. Dripping rainwater onto the red bus seats, each of which sported a Harvard seal, the athletes chatted as the bus whisked them through the downpour, back from Allston to Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Complete with a wide array of events ranging from a berry brain break, to a mental health open mic and massages, the Freshman Class Committee kicked off a more expansive “Freshman Health Week” this week than in previous years.
In the third iteration of the initiative, freshmen Undergraduate Council representatives sought to include more aspects of health, including sexual, mental, and physical health.
“[These elements are] all very interconnected in someone’s health, and I think that’s what we saw in conversations that we wanted to improve on,” Ivy Yard Representative Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said.
Although the Freshman Class Committee began conceptualizing Freshman Health Week last fall, the team, under the direction of Committee Chair Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, officially started planning in early February.
“I think the past projects were piloted experiments on how successful the week-long projects can be,” Ivy Yard Representative and Freshman Class Committee Treasurer Scott Xiao ’19 said. “We got a lot more ambitious and expansive.”
While the program last year featured one event per day, this year students could choose from two to three events most days, ranging from zumba, yoga, and a food-literacy cook-off to journaling, color-booking, and a petting zoo.
The Freshman Class Committee paid particular attention to publicity and wide-ranging class engagement, utilizing social media and a promotional video to reach more students.
“I think our publicity was successful because if you talk to freshmen, most of them are at least aware that this project is going on, and that’s our main goal,” Crimson Yard Representative Leah D. Stewart ’19 said.
The committee members saw large turnouts for their events, “especially for events that are more largely focused, like the mental health open mic and the berry brain break,” Xiao said.
Over 30 people converged in the Cambridge Queen’s Head pub for the mental health open mic on Tuesday. At the event, attendees told stories of overcoming various sexual and mental barriers, performed spoken word, and participated in joint sing-alongs, led by Zhang on ukulele.
Some attendees said they were moved by the personal reflections.
“I think these stories are rather eye-opening, because mental health and those kind of things aren’t really what’s discussed a lot in the public,”  Peter Seung Min Lee ’19 said. “I think it’s very enlightening to hear that kind of stuff and what we can do to be part of the solution.”
Another focal event was the coloring book brain break, now more widely-known as the “Berry Brain Break.”
“When I walked in at 9:15 p.m. and saw a line way out the door, I was so excited. We do plenty of initiatives on the UC, and when you see a turnout like that, we were all just high-fiving each other. Really awesome feeling,” Stewart said.
The coloring book event was another addition to the brain break, which many students praised.
“Taking time to do something as simple as color[ing] feels...very indulgent, but making time to take care of yourself shouldn't be a rare indulgence,” Audrey H. Effenberger ’19 said. “The arts are a good way to express that totally selfish, self-creative, and self-restorative feeling.”
While the Freshman Dean’s Office was not officially involved in the planning, Interim Dean of Student Life and Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 participated by judging a food literacy cook-off.
“I think it’s a great thing for them to do,” Dingman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Design’s Gund Hall sticks out among Harvard’s red-brick laden campus. While some might regard the concrete exterior as ugly, some say the interior could serve as a model for a university that lacks central social spaces. Still, others contend that the building’s size and limited availability of workspaces leave certain master's degree students feeling left out.
Gund hall currently features a cafeteria, auditorium, fabrication lab, library, classrooms, and offices. At the heart of the building, though, are the four floors of desks, also known as trays, which offer collaborative spaces for nearly 600 studio students. The terraced, open floor plan allows students from the top floor to see the models that students on the mezzanine are designing, and vice-versa. The hope is to foster collaboration and spontaneity.
The Design School’s Director of Facilities Management Kevin W. Cahill said it is commonly known that students spend over 80 hours per week at the school.
“What we have here is different disciplines in the same space so they get to see what each other are doing just by being in the studio. You get to see all the other projects and see what people in other programs are doing as well as people in your program,” Cahill said. “That in itself is a learning experience,” he said.
Beyond the space inside the studio, the school also has built in social spaces on each of the floors.
“No one leaves the building… GSD becomes like a bubble from the middle of the semester until the end,” Masters in Design Studies candidate Aman Singhvi said.“Some people even have this conversation: why are they paying rent to live somewhere else?”
When Gund Hall was conceived nearly 50 years ago, it was designed to serve a much smaller student population, Cahill said. The GSD has grown since then in terms of both the size of student body and number of degree programs.
While the studio provides desks for the Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Urban Planning and Design programs, the Master in Design Studies program is left without any sanctioned space because the program is not studio-based, according to GSD Communications Manager Travis Dagenais.
The lack of desk space for Master in Design Studies students has been a divisive subject within the program. In the past, students have posted stickers asking “Where are our desks?” around Gund.
Though Singhvi did not participate in the sticker movement, he said the absence of desk space is detrimental to some students. “I kind of feel homeless,” Singhvi said.
Others are apathetic to the cause. “Initially, before I came here, it was disappointing to find that out. Afterwards, it turned out that it does not seem to be a drawback for me or our class in general,” Masters in Design Studies candidate Xuan Luo said. Luo said that many of his peers came from studio backgrounds, which leads to the initial backlash against the lack of desks.
The school has recently devoted space for Master’s Design Studies program at 7 Sumner Rd. Several masters students also have space in research labs, Dagenais said.
“The school is growing, which certainly, in my opinion, is a good thing. Certainly our leadership and administration is aware of how much space we have and have been working with and very proactively exploring ways to work with the space,” Dagenais said.
Eventually, the GSD plans to give students space in the newly renovated Sackler Museum. The space will likely not be available until Fall 2018, prompting some to critique their perceived inclusion at GSD.
“I feel we [are] alone. I stay at home still working, but I feel like I can’t see other people’s work or communicate with other people so instantly. The only time that I can communicate is in the classroom and that is only two hours in a week so that is not efficient,” Masters in Design Studies candidate Zhiwei Liao said.
Beyond the controversy over desk spaces, many students defended the building’s brutalist style, arguing it could be a model for University common spaces.
“I know people from outside think it is the ugliest building in the Harvard community. I think that building is perceived by the GSD community and within the architecture community as a very good piece of architecture,” Masters in Architecture candidate Jeronimo van Schendel Erice said.
He said Harvard can learn a lot from Gund Hall when erecting interdisciplinary spaces.
“[Gund Hall] has good and bad things but for sure the good things are lacking in a lot of the buildings of the University. Even the idea of having an building where everyone can meet and that fosters that kind of environment is something you don’t see in the University,” Schendel said.

Freshmen gathered at the Barker Center, the College’s home for the humanities, Thursday evening for “The Humanities and Your Financial Future,” a panel event which brought together alumni to talk about their career paths with degrees in the humanities.
About 20 students attended the panel to hear seven alumni talk about their concentrations, which included Classics, Comparative Literature, and English, and their experiences after graduation as lawyers, financial consultants, doctors, and business owners.
Students inquired about the applicability of skills learned in the humanities in business and medical fields, and the financial realities of being a professional academic. Explaining why he was drawn to the event, Jack B. Smith ’19 said, “The title combines what I really want to study and my biggest fear.”
Following the alumni testimonials, several freshman said the event reassured them about studying in the humanities. Marina F. Felix ’19 called the panel “validating.” “I’m feeling really good walking forward doing exactly what I want to do without a fear,” she said.
The panel was just one of many job-focused advising events that departments have organized over Advising Fortnight, the annual two weeks of concentration advising events that encourage freshmen to think about futures in various fields of study.
In addition to events on potential courses of study, some Arts and Humanities concentrations such as Classics, Germanic Literatures and Languages, and Romance Languages and Literatures also hosted career-oriented events for students during the two weeks.
These events fit into the larger trend of job-oriented marketing within the Arts and Humanities as many concentrations seek to attract more students and address their career concerns through an increase in job-focused advising events, alumni interactions, and published materials.
OFF THE BEATEN PATH
Student doubts about the applicability of a humanities degree are not new—colleges across the country have been grappling with declining interest in the humanities for years as concentrators in pre-professional fields and fields in the sciences and social sciences have increased.
A March 2016 study conducted by the Humanities Indicators project of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences revealed that the percentage of bachelor’s degrees awarded nationally in the humanities in 2014 was just 9.9 percent. Degrees in the sciences accounted for 34.6 percent of all bachelor’s degrees , while business and management fields awarded 18.5 percent of all degrees.
At Harvard, the humanities fair slightly better. In a survey of the recently admitted Class of 2020, 16.9 percent of students indicated they wanted to study the humanities. This marks a rise from the 14.8 percent of last year’s survey of the Class of 2019.
Administrators and professors within the humanities say the imbalance between students pursuing humanities degrees and seemingly more practical degrees may reflect the belief that the humanities do not directly feed into specific careers.
“As far as I can tell, one of the problems of the humanities as a whole is that there is no track,” said Lauren O. Kaminsky, the Director of Studies for the History and Literature concentration. “It is easy for me to understand why some students who are very worried about employment after graduation will chose a concentration that they imagine feeds directly into a certain sector of the economy.”
Professor James Robson, who serves as Director of Undergraduate Studies for East Asian Languages and Civilizations, echoed the sentiment.
“We face those challenges of not having a discipline that they walk away with,” he said. “In many cases, you can imagine the pressures that are on [students] to get a career, to get a job that is going to be successful.”
Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha agreed that many students want to study something that will “prepare them for a professional career.”
Bhabha added, however, that the distancing of the humanities from sciences in discussion is another prevalent problem.
“So much of the debate on the value of the humanities is actually posed in opposition to the assumed value of the sciences and the social sciences,” he said.
According to Bhabha, such discussion both labels the fields as mutually exclusive and contributes to the misbelief that studying the humanities is not as tangibly useful as degrees in the hard and social sciences.
Executive Director of the Mahindra Center and History and Literature lecturer Steven Biel argued that it can be easy to talk about the importance of the arts and humanities, but it can be harder for students to justify such studies.
“We all know the value of work in the humanities, but it remains implicit instead of explicit,” he said.
BRIDGING THE GAP
In her role as Dean of the Arts and Humanities, Diana Sorensen has worked to promote the skills and knowledge that she feels come with studying the humanities. Sorensen has also emphasized the importance of making the humanities accessible to students whose backgrounds may not have allowed them previous experience in the fields.
“If you didn’t go to a great high school and have a brilliant English or French teacher,” she said, “you might have never developed an interest let alone a sense of confidence in your ability to handle humanities courses.”
Sorensen emphasized the importance of supporting those students as well as first-generation students in the humanities. She cited the role of the humanities frameworks classes, the humanities colloquium, and that freshman seminars can play in this endeavor.
“All of those [courses] are meant to reassure potential first-generation students,” she said. “We think those courses are a great opportunity for first-generation students, that’s why we call them gateways.”
Director of the Semitic Museum and professor in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Peter Der Manuelian said he hopes that these courses will convince more people about the cultural benefit of studying the humanities.
“I’d love to see people who are first-gen come in and say, ‘this isn’t just a luxury field or a throw away or something I don't have time for because I have a family to support or I have to meet parental expectations, but something that is going to make me a better global citizen,’” he said.
While most interviewed administrators and professors did not distinguish between first-generation students and other students with regards to studying the humanities, several noted that family pressure to study something “practical” may be a factor for many students.
Lecturer and acting Director of Studies in NELC Gojko Barjamovic said that students may have difficulty initially explaining to their parents the value and applicability of a degree in the humanities.
“I could understand easily why it could be difficult to justify to a parent,” he said. “That need for justification is now acute, especially for a regional and historical department.”
In addition to family pressure, students may also feel lost or confused navigating the opportunities available both in and outside of the humanities, according to Kaminksy.
“We act very often as if these things are self-evident or obvious, and they’re not at all,” she said.
DEPARTMENTAL OUTREACH: ALUMNI AND ADVISING
Individual departments and the division of the Arts and Humanities at large are working to address students’ concerns about careers and concentration logistics through an intensification of outreach events. The advising initiatives highlight alumni as both resources for students and examples of the opportunities available to students with humanities degrees.
Sorensen and her staff have produced a brochure entitled “What Can You Do with a Concentration in the Arts & Humanities?” It features short biographies and job experiences of seven alumni who received humanities degrees.
Individual departments have initiated their own alumni programs, which have included panel discussions, online blogs, and dinners. Robson commented that alumni and their career paths are featured on the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations website, and the department also sponsors larger events for students to meet with alumni of the concentration.
“If they’re in the area, we try to invite them to speak to undergraduates about possible career paths and things to open their eyes to different possibilities,” Robson said.
Alumni interviews, quotations, and biographies are featured on the websites of the majority of Arts and Humanities concentrations, including Hist and Lit, English, Comparative Literatures, Philosophy, and Music.
Kaminsky emphasized the value of such narratives to current and prospective students of the humanities because they “make visible some of those choices that can be a little bit opaque, especially at the beginning of your college career.”
The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid has also been emphasizing the humanities in their recruitment and information programs. Senior Admissions Officer Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 highlighted an admissions video used for recruitment that features the humanities.
Gilfillian added that the inception of the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration and the reopening of the Harvard Art Museums has led to some “humanities-specific communications” that were sent to prospective and admitted students via email.
With the end of the semester approaching and the recent appointment of History of Art and Architecture Chair Robin E. Kelsey as next year’s dean of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, it remains to be seen whether the trend of career-oriented marketing of the humanities continues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the Harvard women’s water polo team went 0-4 collectively against conference rivals Indiana, Michigan, and Princeton. Though its three rivals have remained among the top 16 squads in the nation, the Crimson has returned to the pool in 2016 looking much improved.
No. 13 Harvard (19-4, 0-0 CWPA), now holding its highest ranking ever, is set to take on the same trio this weekend at Canham Natatorium in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where it will face the No. 15 Hoosiers (15-6, 0-1) and the No. 8 Wolverines (20-6, 1-0) on Saturday, followed by the No. 16 Tigers (13-3, 0-0) on Sunday morning.
Saturday afternoon’s game against host Michigan is the team’s senior night and will be broadcasted live on the Big Ten Network.
“It’s quite the weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “It’s quite the 24 hours. It’s going to be fun to play these games because it’s high-level water polo and that’s why we do what we do—to compete and to compete against the best.”
The trio of matches constitutes the kickoff of conference play for the Crimson. The team has mostly found success during the regular season, posting an 8-3 record against teams ranked in the top 25 and playing to an overall 19-4 mark.
Still, Minnis insisted that conference play requires the ability to adjust. The sixth-year coach has repeatedly emphasized preparation for conference play, and Saturday marks the time to begin implementing that preparation.
“Now that you’ve got film and they have film, you see what kinds of things that [other teams] are doing,” Minnis said. “It’s going to be adjustments made and seeing how teams react to those adjustments.”
The Crimson has already had a taste of Indiana and Princeton from earlier this season. In February, Harvard squeaked by the Hoosiers in overtime, snapping a 13-game losing streak to the team, but dropped its 22nd straight game to the Tigers in March.
The Crimson is now 1-13 all-time against Indiana and 12-37 against Princeton. Harvard has yet to play the Wolverines this season but is 2-8-1 against them all-time.
The Crimson’s opponents will have to contend with standout rookie Kristen Hong, who leads the team with 59 goals, 26 assists, and 32 steals and has garnered a Harvard-record five CWPA I/II Rookie of the Week awards.
Joining her in the Crimson history books is sophomore goalie Cleo Harrington, who has claimed four CWPA I/II Defensive Player of the Week awards. She has racked up 190 saves, 15 assists, and nine steals on the season.
Hong is not alone in generating offensive output for the Crimson, however. Four different Harvard players—junior attackers Michelle Martinelli and Melissa Balding and senior attackers Yoshi Andersen and Charlotte Hendrix—have at least 32 goals; together the four teammates have accounted for 142 scores.
The other end of the pool will feature several standout players to counteract the Crimson’s star power. Michigan senior attacker and captain Ali Thomason has been a goal-scoring machine, churning out 64 goals, in addition to having a stellar 90-10 mark in opening sprints. Michigan sophomore attacker Caroline Andersen, meanwhile, has contributed 34 goals, 51 assists, and 36 steals.
“[Andersen’s] a very talented player, and I don’t know if you can really game plan for Caroline,” said Minnis, who has coached Andersen's older sisters in past years. “She’s able to score the ball, she’s able to pass the ball to set up for assists, [and] she’s a very dynamic player. She’s got great speed. You just have to hope that you can know where she is, protect one phase, and hope she doesn’t get to you in the other phase.”
Princeton sophomore utility Haley Wan leads the Tigers with 32 goals, 24 assists, and 22 steals in only 16 games. Indiana sophomore defender Kelly Matthews has put up 95 points, with 56 goals and 39 assists, to lead any player amongst the four teams in points, though Hong and Andersen aren’t far behind.
Harvard, Michigan, Indiana, and Princeton all will have played each other at least once by this weekend’s end. To kick off the round robin tournament featuring the teams, the Wolverines defeated the Hoosiers in the first game of conference play last Saturday, constituting Michigan’s 16th victory over a top-25 opponent this season.

There’s no denying that the students here at Harvard are smart. But when it comes to basic, everyday tasks, there are some things that Harvard kids just don’t get. Common sense is just not our forte. Here are a few things that Harvard doesn’t teach us:
How to Do Laundry
“Wait, where does the pod go? Will it just magically dissolve in the wash? And why is there a fabric softener option on my washer? I thought the fabric softener went into the dryer? Oh my god, laundry costs 1.50 per cycle?” And, unless you are one of those salmon-colored walking billboards, “why on earth are all my dress shirts pink now?”
These are the thoughts going through the heads of the laundry-uninitiated.There’s a strange nuance to doing laundry that doesn’t quite manifest itself at Harvard. Here, laundry is something done between psets. Clothes are hastily piled into the nearest free machine, set on their 34 minute cycle, and forgotten about (often for hours) until something in the back of your mind makes you put down your pencil and finish your laundry load. The result: mountains of water-logged garments cluttering up hot laundry rooms, and undergraduates complaining on their respective class Facebook groups about “those people that don’t move their laundry.” In the real world, there’s a tightness to doing laundry, and some would even argue an art. Harvard just doesn’t teach you that.
How to Cook
Why cook when there are dining halls that are stuffed with food? Sure, the food isn’t exactly served up by Chef Gordon Ramsey, but it is edible, and on many occasions, pretty tasty. Not to mention the square shops always waiting with their doors open to take you money and fill your skin with adipose. Except for the ones that have unceremoniously closed *ahem* Panera *ahem.* There’s so much ready-to-eat food around that if you do get to use your dorm’s communal kitchen, you are a rare outlier that needs to be worshipped. Or, depending on if you’re that person that keeps setting off the fire alarm at 2 AM, burned in effigy.
Budgeting
Harvard is a money-full place (and apparently a place where you can make up your own words, too.) Even if you are on a tight budget, the exorbitant nature of the campus and the ridiculous money traps waiting to waylay you on your way to class make budgeting an afterthought. Sometimes, a worried financial aid officer will hold a finances workshop, but chances are the lessons go in and out of your head just like last week’s 9 a.m. lecture.
How to Deal with the Unspectacular
There’s always something out of the ordinary going on around you when you are here at Harvard. Top-level government officials, ex-Presidential candidates and world renowned authors seem to stalk the campus, always ready to give advice or to have a meal. The reality is that, once you leave Harvard, you probably won’t be surrounded by that regular influx of spectacular people and things.
That Free Food Does Not Exist in the Real World

The theme of Mather Lather, a College-wide foam party hosted by Mather House hosted every spring, this year is #FOAMO. But to be honest, given the recent mumps outbreak at Harvard, are you really missing out if you don’t go?
Word on the street has it that Mather consulted medical experts to determine whether or not the party could end up as a hotbed for mumps. After hearing this tip, we knew it was time for another famous #FlybyInvestigates.
When asked about whether or not the party’s organizers consulted Harvard University Health Services, Mather House Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten responded affirmatively.
“I had a long conversation with Dr. [Paul] Barreira about mumps and the Lather, and he indicated Harvard is not discouraging large group events including the Lather.” Barreira is the director of HUHS.
That’s great! HUHS isn’t discouraging parties in general! But “the Lather” is not a normal party. Students have previously gotten rashes from the foamy gathering, and I wasn't ruling out mumps just yet. So I continued the investigation.
Mather House Committee co-chair Trevor A. Mullin ’17 reiterated that Barreira was consulted “to make sure Mather Lather did not pose a threat to the health and safety of students.”
“To my understanding, they were told that the College was not discouraging large scale gatherings and that the environment of Mather Lather did not provide an additional risk to students as compared to any other large-scale gathering.”
So it seems like Mather Lather will be safe from mumps this year. Still, that won’t stop me from taking at least 10 showers after the party is over.
