To say that the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s one-performance, experimental production “Öğk,” directed by Cengiz Cemaloğlu ’18, was a failure as a play would be to make a gross mockery of language. Theater did not happen. Cemaloğlu is to be regarded not as a director but rather as a very talented perpetrator of the artistic long con.
Before the incoherent (and in some ways irrelevant) action of “Öğk” is described, it is necessary to explain the circumstances of the play. “Öğk” is a dream reenactment commissioned by an anonymous client of Cemaloğlu’s Reality Theater Co. according to Cemaloğlu. Its website says that the Reality Theater Co. offers “services” that, beside dream reenactments, include “social engineering,” “creative occasion management,” and “private theater services.”  These services all seem essentially to be variations on the idea of getting money from people to “fix” problems and indulge eccentricities by pretending to do things. The performance, held in the Adams Pool Theater, was a private, invitation-only affair, according to Cemaloğlu. All cast and crew members were paid with the commission, as confirmed to the Crimson by Cemaloğlu and HRDC President Magdalene M. Zier ’16, who said that, while “Öğk” was an unusual production, it was in compliance with all HRDC policies.
In short, this was not an open performance for the Harvard community but a private, paid social event, one in which there was apparently little effort to appeal to the public at large. Indeed, issues of publicity were oddly suppressed—cast and crew lists were not available on the HRDC website, and programs with cast and crew lists were not distributed at the performance. These facts raise the question of why Cemaloğlu was allowed to use the resource of HRDC’s Common Casting, which was instituted to make theater on campus fairer and more open. Indeed, Common Casting is the only apparent connection between “Öğk” and the Harvard community, since the affair was funded by an anonymous commissioner and the Pool Theater is always booked by individual producers without any mediation through Office for the Arts or HRDC.
From these circumstances, it seems that Cemaloğlu has successfully gotten around the spirit of HRDC’s mission for his own theater company’s benefit. Only in the performance itself, however, did it become clear that “Öğk” was nothing but an artistic fraud. As previously mentioned, “Öğk” was a dream reenactment, and it proved to be as incoherent and ultimately vapid as most dreams. Jennifer (Elana P. Simon ’18) stood on the stage in a dress composed primarily of shaving cream. She began to dance. A man from the audience (Thomas W. Peterson ’18) stood, stripped to his underwear, and approached the stage. Another man in a suit (Jamie P. Herring ’18) stood, removed his mask, and came to the stage. The rest of the performance was almost completely incomprehensible, mere random dancing with occasional shouted utterances. The work was divided into two acts, but this division was essentially arbitrary, as there was no dramatic movement whatsoever in either of them.
Indeed, Cemaloğlu has delivered what the Reality Theater Co. said he would—a performance of a dream, with no effort to make any meaning or order from the images he was given to use. This sort of operation is the closest thing to a theatrical ready-made, or, phrased in economic terms, the closest thing to money for nothing. Through his Reality Theater Co., Cemaloğlu has discovered a way to acquire funding from his clients without rendering services that are ultimately more sophisticated than organizing logistics, and certainly without presenting any sort of legitimate artistic work.
While the bizarreness and lack of coherent artistic vision of “Öğk” to some extent precluded extreme criticism of its execution, there are problems inherent to presenting a dream on stage. Dream physics do not work in the same way as real physics, and to present the ethereal, weightless movement achieved in the action of dreams requires dancing and choreography well beyond the skill that can be expected of non-professionals. As a result, most of the dance in this show consisted of slow stomping, awkward leaps, and lockjaw-style twisting. The few lines were delivered in loud monotone, giving the impression that the actors had as little understanding of their characters as the audience, or less.
“Öğk” has raised interesting questions, but, like a silhouette, does so by outlining them with negative space. For whom is theater on campus? Should Harvard’s open artistic resources be used privately for payment? What projects deserve HRDC support, and how are those decisions made? As a discussion piece, it has great interest, but as a piece of theater, it was entirely devoid of virtue.

Heems, formerly of Das Racist, has made a career of alternatively shockingly intellectual treatises and boneheaded non-sequiturs. He is an uproarious metamodernist, an anti-rapper whose production and flow is brilliant despite the madness. But seldom is Heems serious. That’s why “Home,” the first single from “Eat, Pray, Thug,” his March 10 release, is so new. Not only is Heems grounded, but Dev Hynes—better know as Blood Orange—provides an equally somber and ambient soundscape for Heems’s seemingly unironic angst. The result, a minimalist but hard-hitting track, shows that Heems can resist esoteric shout-outs or slob-boy personae and still be engaging.
Heems raps the self-aware chorus to Das Racist’s anthemic “hahahaha jk,” where he states that the group is “Not joking / Just joking / We are joking / Just joking / We’re not joking.” Maybe Heems has just abandoned constant toggling of authenticity and humor for a facsimile of emotional forthrightness. In any case, lines like “When it’s cold outside / Yeah I miss you / But we had too many issues” seem honest. Heems also sings most of the lines in a focused and angry baritone that is far more on-pitch and controlled than most of his other melodic efforts. If he’s trying to make fun of angsty melodic rap anthems, he has created an awfully impressive one.
The story is fairly straightforward: Heems has gone through a horrific breakup and is not over it. He addresses his girlfriend, telling her “Shawty listen / quit your bitchin’ / Be my remix to ‘Ignition.’” Yes, this and a couple of other lines in the Heems’s second verse are admittedly chuckle-worthy. But even they seem to be a reflection of his feelings rather than ironies. Hynes’s murky backing sounds more out of the 1980s than anything he has ever produced, which is quite a qualifier given his output. The calypso vibraphone that starts off the song is accompanied by a piercing, Prince-like guitar arpeggio that interpolates as Heems’s sad world comes into focus. It’s a gorgeously anachronistic accompaniment that is just morose enough to bring his woes into sharp focus.
Sincerity isn’t entirely new to Heems; his numerous mixtapes have more down-to-earth tracks, and his verse on Vampire Weekend’s “Step” remix poignantly describes a college relationship (“We went to Wesleyan and she scoffed at Vassar / I met her at a wine and cheese, I looked right past her”). The difference in “Home,” then, is Heems’s relative dearth of references and more measured, less modulating vocals. While “Home” may not be indicative of Heems’s general mood, the gravitas of the song is an unexpectedly welcome shift.

In the past, of Montreal has displayed remarkable stylistic variation, creating everything from the effervescent innocence of their 1997 debut “Cherry Peel” to the blues-rock sound of 2013's “Lousy with Sylvanbriar,” all while giving all of their music distinctive psych-pop flair. However, with their most recent release, “Aureate Gloom,” this wellspring of stylistic creativity appears to be drying up. The album comes off as if the group crammed some of their funkier mid-career sounds into a continuation of their recent bluesy streak and blindly hoped that the result would be compelling.
Of Montreal has been consistently heading towards darker lyrical content since their 2004 release of “Satanic Panic in the Attic,” a trend “Aureate Gloom” continues. The album’s overall impression, reinforced by occasional religious imagery, is that of a confessional. Gentle musings that suggest a window into lead singer and writer Kevin Barnes's internal monologue give way to starkly emotional lyrics; he screams, “My heart is a mess / The ruins depressed / The shrill of our withering depths.” Barnes's talk-singing is viscerally effective for these passages of raw emotion, but it becomes painful when applied to long strings of purple prose and risks overpowering the more vocally and melodically diverse sections of the album. The despondency can also be excessive; while a hint of melancholy added maturity to some earlier albums, “Aureate Gloom” lacks the usual bits of delightful twee that could balance out the overwrought despair.
For an album recorded directly to tape the sound is surprisingly polished, especially given how complex—almost to the brink of disorganization—some of of Montreal's work can be. But achieving this polish seems to have come at the expense of creative freedom. None of the tracks on “Aureate Gloom” are notably terrible, but the group’s mid-career albums offer much the same fare with more vitality and sparkle. Even some of the songs that start with panache—such as “Apollyon Of Blue Room”—fade as they go on. Of Montreal has never shied from long and repetitive outros, but, as nearly every track on “Aureate Gloom” boasts a minute-long tail of two repeated lines, they inevitably begin to drag. Add this to the fact that most of the tracks rely on very similar combinations of straightforward rhythmic vocal sections with more ethereal segments focused on elaborate instrumentation, and the result is a somewhat monotonous collection that is perfectly good as background music but doesn't really merit focused listening.
There are, of course, a few exceptions, the tracks that ultimately save “Aureate Gloom”  from complete mediocrity. “Bassem Sabry” provides a strong opening for the collection. Named after the late Egyptian activist and journalist, the track may be of Montreal's most overtly political work to date. It proclaims that “every leader is a cellophane punk” and laments that “people disappear on the wrong side of this revolution / When they resurface, there's a black hole in their skull.” Its brisk pace offsets the lethargy of some of the later tracks, and it manages to achieve something that even some of the group's best work does not: it is infectiously catchy. Where “Bassem Sabry” is lyrically energized, “Empyrean Abattoir” is instrumentally engaging. The track beautifully juxtaposes a bright, bouncing beat with haunting glissando vocals, the dominant melody occasionally subsumed by moments of shimmering cacophony. It builds to more intense vocals, creating complexity without feeling scattered.
The final song, “Like Ashoka's Inferno of Memory” encompasses everything that “Aureate Gloom” could have been. It deftly explores the myriad vocal and instrumental styles that of Montreal so loves to combine; while on much of the album this mix of styles makes individual songs feel disjointed, this track makes these transitions effortlessly. By turn, “Like Ashoka's Inferno of Memory” offers everything: airy melodies, intense beats, soft vocals, talk-singing (but not to excess), hazy electronic sounds, crystal clear instrumentals, and clever lyrics. Had every track been so skillfully put together, “Aureate Gloom” would have been a stellar showcase for of Montreal.

The start of “First Regret,” the labyrinthine first track from progressive rock guru and former Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson’s newest concept album “Hand. Cannot. Erase.,” is a series of pastoral British bells and youthful hollerings. The encroaching synthesizer that seeps in harkens back to “Shine On You Crazy Diamond,” the equally epic suite that bookended Pink Floyd’s 1975 “Wish You Were Here.” Where Pink Floyd aimed for innovation, however, Wilson wisely chooses pastiche; he doesn’t attempt to say anything inherently new about rock music with in his harrowing 11-song odyssey (assuming it’s possible at this messily post-post-modern juncture) but rather touches on every iconic sound that the genre has ever seen. Just as the Pink Floyd atmosphere solidifies in “First Regret,” tight and modern digitized drums jerk the track into a post-punk polka before settling into a gorgeous refrain that belongs on a CSNY album. The constant stylistic shifting would be overwhelming with a lesser musician and creative force, but Wilson, a virtuosic guitarist, producer, and conceptualist, is more than up for the task. “Hand. Cannot. Erase.,” for all of its stylistic acrobatics, is a somber examination of the loneliness of modern life as well as a delightful examination of the impermanence and startling diversity of contemporary rock.
Wilson claims to have been inspired to write “Hand. Cannot. Erase.” by the story of Joyce Vincent, a successful London professional who suffered domestic violence, largely cut off all communication with her hundreds of relatives and friends, and ended up sitting dead in her apartment for more than two years before being discovered by authorities. While the concept is far more thematic than referential, even a casual listener could feel the haunting sadness and sense of isolation that pervades the lyrics of the album. Wilson takes the corporate malaise of “OK Computer” and multiplies it by 10—ostensibly writing from Vincent’s perspective, Wilson laments the boringness of chores and the claustrophobia of white-collar life. On the almost-titular “Hand Cannot Erase,” Wilson gripes about the dishonesty of the Internet: “Writing lying emails to our friends back home / Feeling guilty if sometimes we wanna be alone.” Despite the impressionism of Wilson’s storytelling, Vincent, or Wilson’s semi-fictional equivalent, comes into focus. By the end of the album, where the Vincentian voice claims on both “Ancestral” and “Happy Returns” that she is getting drowsy, her impending death and neglect is palpable.
“Hand. Cannot. Erase.” is Wilson’s fourth solo album, each of which has been remarkably different and hard to classify. His latest, however, succeeds both in being both his conceptually strangest and most aurally accessible to date. The longest song, “Ancestral,” is the most diverse stylistically, trading in the classic rock vibes of the first track for sounds of 1990s Bristol; deep bass collides with free-jazz flute for a whopping 13.5 minutes. While the latter track is sometimes overwhelming, it is never boring or tuneless—Wilson straddles the line between the anti-forms of more experimental jamming and the tightness of pop music convention with a razor’s edge so thin it threatens to cut the listener’s predictive abilities into a million sterilized pieces.
The contributions of two unexpected female vocalists, the famed, decidedly saccharine Welsh mezzo Katherine Jenkins and inaugural Israeli Idol winner Ninet Tayeb, add a welcome additional perspective to Wilson’s tragic tale. [Instead of a cheesy Christmas-time ballad, ???] Jenkins offers a sober remembrance of a forgotten sibling on “Perfect Life.” Is Jenkins’ voice meant to be the disturbed interior monologue of Wilson’s protagonist? A break from the action? Tayeb switches off verses with Wilson on two tracks, offering a dynamic escape from his sometimes weary words.
Despite Wilson’s monumental guitar breaks and placid, ambient interludes, the album builds almost continuously until its bone-chilling conclusion. The one weak spot and break in momentum is the instrumental “One Regret.” While there are longer periods without vocals on the album, the song comes right after “Home Invasion,” a powerful statement about online consumerism (“Download love and download war / Download the shit you didn’t want / Download the things that made you mad / Download the life you never had”), and before the ethereally folky “Transience.” The passable prog rock exercise is by no means a bad track, but the tune is far less creative and thematically-engaged than anything else on the LP.
The penultimate track, “Happy Returns,” is a terrifyingly cheery melody over a creepy letter from Wilson’s protagonist to her brother. The staccato acoustic strumming in conversation with “Hey brother, many happy returns, its been a while now / I bet you thought I was dead” is, even after an album chock full of confusing macabre confections, too strange to comprehend.

This past February, Muslims students at Harvard were deeply disturbed by the heartbreaking murders of Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Barakat, three young university students in Chapel Hill, who were each shot in the head by their neighbor, Craig Hicks, when he entered their home. The Harvard Islamic Society, composed of Muslim undergraduates, graduates, and professionals at Harvard University, extends its deepest condolences to the victims, their families, and their community. Yusor, Razan, and Deah were, and will continue to be, an inspiration for their service to their communities.
This terrible act quickly made its way to the international stage, shining a spotlight on an increasing number of Islamophobic hate-crimes across the country. Only a few days following the Chapel Hill murders, a large mosque in Houston, Texas was set on fire, and the Islamic School of Rhode Island was vandalized with virulent graffiti. Students at Harvard are not isolated from these acts of hatred. Many of us are from the places where these hate crimes have been perpetrated. Muslim students have also reported experiences of marginalization, discrimination, and threatening behavior at Harvard. Last year, a Muslim undergraduate who wears the hijab was assaulted while riding the T and asked, “Do you think you deserve to be here? To live here?” Earlier this week, another Muslim undergraduate was verbally abused and subsequently threatened by a man who told her, “I’m a marine.”
As Muslims in America, we feel that the average American, and even the average Harvard student, knows very little about who we are, where we come from, and what we stand for. This fact is not helped by a national news media which often propagates misinformation and dehumanizes our community. For that reason, we hope the best approach to addressing the rise of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate in America is education paired with relationship building. To this end, the Harvard Islamic Society encourages anyone interested in learning more about Islam, or meeting Muslims at Harvard, to join us at our weekly Friday religious services from 1:15-2 PM in Lowell Lecture Hall. Our services are attended by everyone from students, to staff, and professors, all standing shoulder-to-shoulder and praying as one.
We are grateful to those who have already reached out to us in solidarity, specifically the Undergraduate Council, and we urge the rest of the Harvard community to join us in taking a stance against bigotry, in all its forms, and in celebrating the diversity that enriches our campus.

The other day in section, (if I had a nickel in BoardPlus for every boring story I’ve heard with that beginning, I could buy out the Barker Cafe) one of my classmates made a comment about an antiquated law or some other asinine turmoil in some Southern state or the other. My recollection is vague because the statement was vague. But regardless, the room erupted in laughter, not really paying attention to the content of the statement—the past fifteen minutes had been that trademark section midway lull; until this point all eyes had been glazed over. The room responded to the simple “laugh-here” punchline the student provided, that punchline being: “The South.”
The South. Cue laughter. Oh, but he was from the South. Cue laughter. You know, the South. Cue laughter.
By this point I’ve learned that this is not an unusual handling of the topic of the modern American South. Sure, I spent a lot of the first eighteen years of my Georgia upbringing complaining about it. Complaining is what high school is for, I’m pretty sure. But still, something about this bothered me. At first I figured it was something like that odd complex that sitcoms often taught me big brothers have, an innate (and creepy and territorial) possession and protection of their little sisters. I imagine some dude on the TV in a jersey and a backwards baseball cap, holding a football in one of his giant, giant hands, thumbing himself in the chest with the other, “The only one who can pick on the little twerp is me.”
I figured that was how I felt about the entire South. Me, the South’s jersey-clad older brother: “I’m the only one who gets to call you stupid!” I say, giving the South a noogie and a wet willy, running off to the arcade with my older buddies.
The whole section laughed. The section leader laughed. And I look around, smiling this one smile I have that makes me feel and look like I’m suffering some kind of machinery meltdown, or like I’m a Mrs. Potato Head doll and I chose the wrong plastic mouth and then put it in the face-hole a little askew.
I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to be laughing at the joke, whatever the joke was, which I’m pretty sure had nothing to do with feeling like the South’s big brother, an easy but unlikely explanation. More likely, unfortunately, is that when a dozen Harvard students gather around a table and laugh at the South, shrug it off as the unrelated and unfortunate growth attached to their endlessly more scholarly and charming Northeast, there is power and presumption at play that I don’t think I am intended to be a part of, and that I’m not sure I’d like to be. Another club I can’t join.
A lot of racist shit happens down South. It is excellent and warranted and exciting when people thoughtfully consider that, questioning what unique Southern history is at play, considering what role education inequity plays in the situation and how racism plays into that, analyzing how history bleeds into the present.
More often though, the conversation doesn’t quite go like that. The conversation goes, “LOL, the South!” And then the conversation is over. And suddenly it’s not a conversation at all. It is a hilarious device, a dark and farcical tale against which it's authors apotheosize themselves.
Growing up, there were people who talked about the North like it was the Promised Land. Here, I’m beginning to hear people talk about the South like it is actual Hell. By substituting laughter for any possible constructive conversation that could take place about what is actually at play and what is actually at stake when it comes to the American South, there becomes a sense of irresponsibility. Oh no, we would never do anything like that. And if we would, at least we’re not the South.
A lot of racist shit happens in the Northeast. But hey, let’s make it personal.  A lot of racist shit happens at Harvard. (Its not just about race, its about ableism and sexism and homophobia and all kinds of prejudice.) It is rare and excellent and warranted when people thoughtfully consider what history is at play here, what education inequity is at play when a Harvard student wearing their new academic privilege like an uncomfortable but expensive sweater vest (or, more likely, like yet another shiny badge on a very old and familiar sweater vest) chuckles and guffaws at all the Southern plebeians.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars of slavery money in the Harvard endowment. Cue laughter. That anti-affirmative action Crimson article. Cue laughter.  That Harvard building named after that slave owner. Cue laughter. Oh and that one, and that one, and that one. What a riot. Cue laughter.
The South can be hilarious. The South can be terribly, terribly racist. And so can the rest of the country. Harvard gets away with passing as a perfectly progressive institution when it simply is not, laughing at those idiotic and shameful “others” all the while. And sometimes that sneaky prejudice and covert oppression hurts more than its outright counterpart. At least those confederate flags waving proudly on pickup trucks back home are obvious. Let’s talk about systems and ideas that transcend borders before we laugh off half of the country as hilariously “other.” You're no angel either, baby.
The energy put into simplifying the modern American South into an easy punchline could be redirected to instead promote what ought to be an essential human practice: Checketh thyself before you wrecketh thyself.

The recent decision by Speaker of the House John Boehner to pass a clean, no-strings-attached bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the rest of fiscal year 2015 is a laudable end to a media circus that has set a regrettable precedent for the last two years of President Obama's term. Both our previous support for the President's immigration ideas and our opposition to the President's methods remain unchanged; however, the response should never be to hamstring critical government functions and budgetary priorities in an effort to score political points.
For Congressional Republicans who doubt the legality of the President's executive action on immigration, the appropriate recourse does not lie in stopping the critical business of government; instead, a legislative solution that renders executive action either unnecessary or irrelevant ought to be found. Republicans and Democrats alike have agreed on the need for comprehensive immigration reform, stopped only by Congressional gridlock and partisan bickering. The Republicans could end the standoff by swiftly approving a complete immigration reform plan.
There is a right way and a wrong way. The strategy that the Republicans have taken is clearly misguided. The attempt to shut down the Department of Homeland Security is especially pernicious because it continues a dangerous trend of conservative attempts to use unrelated federal responsibilities as leverage over specific political positions. Recent examples of this dangerous tactic of brinksmanship include the 2014 government shutdown, as well as the debates over the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling.
Such a trend seriously threatens the ability of our government to function properly, if any and every political disagreement could suddenly consume the totality of government. Of course, the Republicans are correct in saying that a link exists between immigration reform and the DHS. After all, it is the DHS that enforces our immigration laws, but their responsibilities also include so much more. The DHS protects our borders, our airports, and our President; the DHS operates search and rescue helicopters, hurricane aid stations, and lighthouses; the department catches drug smugglers, counterfeiters, and human traffickers. These are all essential government functions that should not be compromised by an issue connected to immigration policy solely through the accidental whims of bureaucracy and government organizational charts.
Over the next two years, there will undoubtedly be numerous issues on which the President and the Speaker will strongly disagree—including more disagreements over immigration policy. The smooth and effective functioning of this nation’s government requires that these disagreements end not in dangerous threats and ultimatums, but instead in compromise, as elusive as that may be. We commend Speaker Boehner for ultimately choosing pragmatism over devastating partisanship, but it is a sad day when the path to that compromise must add a question mark to the government's operating hours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part II in a three-part series on the College’s residential House system. Part I ran on March 10 and Part III ran on March 12.
In 2009, as Harvard began taking steps toward a comprehensive renewal of its residential House system, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences House Program Planning Committee released a report detailing the changes needed to revitalize the Houses.
In a letter introducing the report, then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds described the House system as “essential, not ancillary, to a Harvard education,” adding that learning occurs in the Houses in the form of discussion among roommates, formal programming, and faculty leadership. Fittingly, the Committee’s very first recommendation in its 110-page report was to encourage more faculty-student engagement in the Houses, focusing on retooling institutions like the Senior Common Room, a group of faculty members affiliated with each House.
As the renewal process detailed in the report nears a milestone with the completion of Dunster House, the first House to undergo a complete renovation, administrators are still working to address the report’s recommendations for strengthening the role of learning in residential life.
However, the primacy of academics in the Houses faces growing threats from two sides: Faculty are living further away from campus, and students find themselves increasingly busy with outside commitments. This can leave House institutions like the Senior Common Room adrift, their traditional role in limbo without direct engagement and promotion by House masters. Even with these challenges, administrators hope significant investment in classrooms and common spaces in the Houses and changes to the Senior Common Room will give new life to their vision of Houses as a space for both living and learning.
MOVING AWAY
Although professors and students share close quarters in classrooms and faculty offices during the day, they head in separate directions after class. For many students, their evening hours are spent participating in extracurricular activities, while faculty leave campus and head to their homes and families.
When Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 was an undergraduate in Eliot House, he said it was more common to see faculty members around the House. Some of the professors in Eliot’s Senior Common Room lived in the House, and many sections and tutorials also took place under Eliot’s roof. It was common for teachers and students to eat together in the dining hall and continue discussions from an earlier class.
According to Dingman, many members of the faculty lived in Cambridge and weren’t married, making it easier for them to spend time in the Houses.
“Houses were meant to be intergenerational,” Dingman said. “They were meant to inspire active involvement in lots of teaching member of the faculty….[there were] more teaching moments in the House.”
However, decades later, the Houses face challenges in bringing a new generation of teachers and students together in the same way.
“[W]e...have to recognize that in 21st century life, many faculty don’t live in Cambridge anymore, so a House is not within walking distance. We have two people working in a family in a partnership unit often, and that means people share responsibilities for home life,” said Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who lives in Cabot House with his wife and three children and serves as the House’s co-master.
Many students are drifting away from House activities towards extracurriculars, spending much of their time outside their House in one of the College’s numerous social or intellectual communities.
Portrait photographer Elsa Dorfman, a longtime member of Mather House’s Senior Common Room, questioned whether students still do find educational value in their House given their commitments elsewhere.
For other students, the drift away from Houses is more mental than physical. Instead of seeing the Houses as an academic community, many see them as a place apart from the pressures of formal classroom education.
“Houses are...great to kind of get away from the stress of academics and going back to a place where you’re socializing with friends,” Quincy House Committee Co-Chair Bianca Mulaney ’16 said. “You don’t want it to be too academic, because you’re already getting so much of that in classes and other activities.”
The desire on the part of students to have Houses as a space apart from the stresses of formal academics is one that House masters have picked up on. Mather House co-master Christie A. McDonald said the educational experience should be different in the Houses in that it should be a place where students can “come home and let your hair down a bit.”
RENEWAL OF LEARNING
From Wednesday Physics Night in Leverett to Eliot’s monthly Experiment Tea, there is a diverse array of pre-existing programming across across the Houses designed to draw in students and engage them intellectually.
Every House has its own combination of language and discussion tables, planned meals, and discussions with faculty that in many ways shape informal learning within the Houses.
To provide more formal academic engagement with students, multiple classes take place inside Houses. For example, the Social Studies sophomore tutorial is organized by House in order for community to develop outside the classroom, according to Anya B. Bassett,  the director of undergraduate studies for Social Studies.
In fact, more classrooms will be constructed within the Houses as renewal proceeds.  According to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, although not all of the Houses will eventually have classrooms, the goal is to try to make them available in each House neighborhood.
Classrooms in these renewed Houses are being built with technologically advanced equipment. The “smart classroom” in Quincy’s Stone Hall, for instance, contains touch-sensitive tablets and document cameras.
And once Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences makes its eventual move to Allston, students will be able to use the classrooms to participate in a class being taught elsewhere, according to Lassonde.
Dunster House Committee Co-Chair Stephanie G. Franklin ’16 said she would be excited to see a classroom similar to the one in Stone Hall built in Dunster. “I know people like studying in the smart classrooms in Stone Hall,” Franklin said.
Administrators also envision common spaces within renewed Houses as places for learning, emphasizing that informal conversations play a critical part in education within the House.
“What really matters in many ways is the interactions that go on, it is the moments of truth when people sort of connect. It is encouraging serendipity, it is creating spaces where new connections can be made,” Khurana said.
In an effort to combat the growing physical distance between faculty and the Houses, the renewal process includes building more scholar suites, according to Khurana, in what he said was “a very intentional way” to increase faculty’s role in the House again.
This emphasis on learning spaces has not come without a cost to other House amenities, however. Last spring, Quincy House saw the elimination of its summer storage in large part because of the development of the smart classroom and common spaces in Stone Hall basement. Additionally, Mulaney said many students feel that with these renovations, they have less privacy for themselves.
“I know people have had really mixed feelings,” Mulaney said. “But I think ultimately the motivation behind [the change] is good.”
'AN OUTDATED CONCEPT'
When the House Program Planning Committee released its report and recommendations, it addressed the lack of information around the identity and purpose of Senior Common Rooms. Noting that Senior Common Rooms theoretically could be a good way to facilitate faculty-student interaction, the report cautioned that in practice, the two constituencies could lack means of connecting with each other.
“The Senior Common Room is an outdated concept that in many cases is not working well for current students and faculty,” the 2009 report reads.
Six years later, not much about the direction of this longstanding House tradition has become clearer.
Several students interviewed for the story expressed confusion about the nature of the Senior Common Room, including a lack of understanding about the role of its faculty or identifying it only as a physical space.
Lassonde has encouraged masters to experiment with how Houses use Senior Common Rooms, acknowledging that they should no longer reflect their original form as places where faculty members may “stop by for sherry and dinner.”
Today, Houses use their Senior Common Rooms differently. Some have worked to strengthen the institution as a means of integrating faculty into residential life, while others have tried to shift the focus of a Senior Common Room from faculty to students.
Eliot House co-master Douglas A. Melton said he and co-master Gail A. O'Keefe had “reconfigured” Eliot’s Senior Common Room by stopping its weekly faculty meetings—a typical feature of Senior Common Rooms across the Houses—and redirecting affiliated faculty members to focus on undergraduates.
O'Keefe added that before they made the change, the Senior Common Room was not really serving the students and the purpose of its existence was not clear.
Meanwhile, Lowell’s co-masters have worked within the Senior Common Room structure, seeking to build up the institution through intensive outreach efforts and additional programming.
According to Lowell House co-master Diana L. Eck, Lowell has not done away with its weekly meetings. Eck said the meetings provide an opportunity for members to talk about issues such as House renewal that they often do not get the chance to discuss. Sherry is sometimes served, Eck added, “in good Harvard fashion.”
“My view of the Senior Common Room is that it is a great thing for students that there is a spectrum of people in the house,” Eck said. “We want students to know that the Senior Common Room is here for them.”
For instance, Eck said that Senior Common Room faculty serve as advisers for Lowell speeches, lead classes in Lowell, participate in the annual sophomore dinner, and various planned meals with Lowell seniors.
For recently appointed professor Michael Bronski, the Lowell Senior Common Room has been an “anchor” for his life at Harvard.
“As somebody who is relatively new to Harvard, [the SCR has been] a really vibrant place to meet people and really feel like you’re part of the House,” Bronski said. “What is really great about the Harvard House System is that it really integrates students with older people... and I think the Senior Common Room is really the epitome of this.”
Even with the concerted efforts of House masters to encourage faculty to engage with the Houses and their residents, Lassonde said many structural barriers still must be addressed before recreating that larger role that faculty used to play in the Houses.
“To have anything like a Senior Common Room in the old style or even a modified form, we need to solve the parking problem and the babysitting problem, and then we’ll be able to get younger faculty involved as well,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has not filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit alleging race-based discrimination in its admissions processes and will meet the plaintiffs of the complaint at a status conference on April 13.
The legal defense group Project on Fair Representation filed the suit against the University last November after soliciting rejected applicants as plaintiffs on its site, “Harvard Not Fair.” Edward Blum, the director of POFR, alleges that Harvard racially balances its incoming classes. He said the University sets “target percentages” for underrepresented minorities and illegal quotas on students of Asian descent.
Harvard filed a response to POFR’s allegations on Feb. 8, denying “each and every allegation, statement, and matter,” particularly the claims of racial discrimination in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Harvard’s response to the lawsuit stated that POFR was not entitled to any form of compensation nor a trial by jury.
The response defended Harvard’s “holistic” admissions process, which “considers each applicant’s background and personal characteristics, including—where relevant—the applicant’s race or ethnicity...as one among many factors.” It also criticized the lawsuit’s claims concerning Harvard’s historical discrimination against Jewish students as irrelevant to the case.
In its response, the University also confirmed that legacy status “may be one among many factors” considered by admissions committees, but denied POFR’s allegation that this consideration gives a “competitive advantage to mainly white, wealthy applicants.”
The complaint, though instigated by POFR, lists the case’s plaintiff as Students for Fair Admissions, Inc., a coalition partly composed of prospective applicants denied admission to Harvard, according to the lawsuit. The suit also said SFFA also counts a number of high school students and their parents as members.
The group’s website lists as a member at least one Asian-American, first-generation student not offered admission to Harvard College’s class of 2014. That student, according to the lawsuit, graduated first in his or her high school and achieved a score of 36 on the ACT and participated in several other extracurricular activities. Based on the student’s profile, he or she should have been offered admission to the College, according to the lawsuit.
Blum said that the case is currently in the discovery period and that his team is gathering evidence to support their allegations.
“We’re very optimistic. Nothing has really begun yet; that’s really what the purpose of the meeting before the judge in April is all about,” he said, adding that those representing the plaintiff will “of course ask for various documents and data” at that meeting.
While hopeful that the case against Harvard will make it to court, Blum said that a full trial “could be many years away.”
Blum previously helped fund 2013 case Fisher vs. University of Texas, a high-profile suit against affirmative action policies alleging that a white woman had been denied admission to the university because of her race, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruling in favor of the University of Texas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the weather has begun warming up a month after Harvard last canceled classes due to inclement weather, remnants of the historically snowy winter still remain in the form of falling icicles.
Icicles attached to the side of buildings on campus and in Harvard Square have begun to fall onto the sidewalks, potentially posing a danger to pedestrians.
As soon as the first storm of the season ended, Harvard has focused on icicle and ice dam clearing through physical removal and melting, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven. She said the majority of the ice has been fully removed.
According to Cowenhoven, the snow removal process has been a collaborative one.
“Removal is managed through a joint effort by Campus Services, local FAS building managers, and external contractors,” she said.
Local concerns about the potential danger of falling ice have appeared in the form of yellow caution tape as various stores and buildings around the Square place signage on their windows warning pedestrians to avoid standing too close to building walls.
Individual Houses and buildings have also made their own efforts to clear icicles and ensure safe walkways for students and other members of the community.
This past Saturday, Adams House co-master Sean Palfrey '67 sent out an email to Adams residents with the subject line “Falling ice can kill,” warning the House about the potential dangers posed by icicles. Adams House in particular has had yellow tape surrounding most of its buildings for the past few days.
“There are still massive boulders of ice on rooves around Harvard and some of us have almost been killed by them,” he wrote. “You will not have time to jump out of the way when the ice starts to slide.”
Paul J. Hegarty, building manager for Leverett House, said Leverett has employed yellow tape and posted signs warning of particularly precarious icicles.
“It’s a non-exact science,” Hegarty said. "There’s old buildings, there’s a lot of snow, it’s melting, ice happens. That’s why we’re telling kids, ‘Be careful.’”
He added that it is impossible to determine when icicle removal will end because the formation of new icicles will depend on the coming weather.
“I can’t control the weather, so unfortunately it’s a little more complex,” he said. “Will there be [more ice]? I don’t know.”

This year’s record snowfalls have forced Harvard’s runners to alter their training regimens and rethink their routes as they practice for varsity meets, prepare for the Boston Marathon, or simply try to stay active through the winter.
The snow and ice on jogging paths by the Charles River, which are rarely cleared, have particularly affected distance runners, forcing them inside onto treadmills or tracks.
Will B. Geiken '15, captain of the Harvard men's cross country team, said that because outdoor practice has been limited to a few routes and because indoor running on treadmills or the track can be dangerous for runners’ Achilles tendons and knees, the team has been forced to cut down on the total number of miles.
"This has definitely been the worst winter for training that I've experienced in my four years," Geiken said.
Fiona M. Davis ’18, a distance runner on the women’s track and field team, said her team practices outside in temperatures well below zero and has even driven to Concord to run on less-trafficked roads, but has used the indoor track and cross-training facilities more than usual this winter.
The snow has also had an effect on students preparing for the Boston Marathon in April. Maria E. Kalina ’16, who is training with the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, said some weekends she has run as many as 16 miles on the treadmill because of the impassibility of paths by the river.
“It’s not the most exciting thing,” she said, adding that the sense of community with students in HCMC, which send emails over the organization’s listserv telling other runners when they will be at the gym, has helped with the boredom.
Runners practicing shorter distances have been less affected by the snow. “We’re running every day just like we would every other year,” said Ben D. Dickensheets ’15, the president of the Harvard College Running Club.
Given the conditions on the river paths, Dickensheets said, “we adjust for that by going for runs in the neighborhoods where people tend to keep the sidewalks more clear.”
Alina M. Acosta ’17, the club’s vice president, added that the club even had higher than normal turnout on days when classes were canceled for snow.
With the exception of its distance runners, Harvard’s track and field team has so far also been largely unaffected by the snow, given that winter season events are indoors. But the team’s outdoor season begins in just over two weeks, at which point wintry conditions will affect all the runners, according to men’s co-captain Jarvis K. Harris ’15.
“We’ll have to remain creative to make new drills and train as well as we realistically can,” he said.

At a dinner discussion on Tuesday commemorating the 50th anniversary of civil rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, students discussed the legacy of the marches and modern-day racism in the United States.
Members of the Harvard Political Union posed questions to attendees, touching on issues such as the use of the “Black Lives Matter” social media hashtag by other groups.
Some expressed concern that such use of the hashtag might diminish the power of the original movement. However, most attendees said they believed that the hashtag should serve as a vehicle to achieve similar goals for marginalized groups, especially in an age where social media is a powerful platform for protest.
“We are in an age where a lot of the social protest can come down to what you post, what hashtag you are using in your Instagram pictures, your Facebook posts, or your Twitter feeds,” said Omobolaji O. Ogunsola, a resident tutor in Pforzheimer House.
Ogunsola also commented on the differences between Selma and current social movements. She said that protestors at Selma had more focused demands for political and legal change than those in Ferguson, Mo., where protests errupted after a white police officer who shot and killed a black man last summer was not indicted.
“Everyone was saying, ‘We need to do something,’ but no one knew what to do except be out in the streets,” Ogunsola said. She said while the Ferguson protests received national attention, they should also think about how to turn protest into political change.
“There is a lot of attention on protests, but not a lot of attention on the actual policies that need to be changed and what we can do to be a part of active change,” Ogunsola said.
Discussion also turned to the issue of racism and how Americans speak about race. Brandon A. Wilks ’17 said Americans need to change the way society speaks about marginalized groups.
“If you create a dialogue or rhetoric where people have value, hence the idea behind 'Black Lives Matter,' and you attribute that to other marginalized groups...that same change can happen,” Wilks said.
The discussion also touched on the definition of racism and how people address the issue. Kelcee A. Everette ’18 said during the discussion that “people don’t have the right idea of what racism is. I feel like people still have that idea of racism being that blacks have to sit in the back of the bus.”
She said many often overlook the issue of everyday microaggressions when defining racism.
The discussion, called “50 Years after Selma: A Student Dinner Discussion,” was sponsored by the Black Men’s Forum, the Black Students Association, and the Association of Black Harvard Women.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost all watched on TV, but not everyone recognized the street names. Almost all remember the news coverage, but not every Harvard student remembers a campus on lockdown.
On April 15, 2013, when the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly set down two backpacks loaded with explosives at the end of the Boston Marathon, some current Harvard students were on their way to Visitas, some were still in high school, and some were at the marathon itself.
For some underclassmen hailing from far away, the Boston Marathon bombing was a tragedy cushioned by distance. The attack felt more real when they set foot on streets they had seen only in headlines, students said.
“I think I realize the gravity of the situation more now that I’m here at Harvard,” said Hueyjong Shih ’18, of Maryland. “It hits closer to home.”
For many students who were on campus or who grew up in the Boston area, the attack felt much more personal. Some local students said they can identify a connection to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother who is currently on trial for 30 charges, 17 of which are capital offenses that carry the death penalty. Tsarnaev once worked as a lifeguard at a Harvard pool and went to school a few blocks down from Annenberg Hall.
Reed E. McConnell ’15 remembers watching the empty streets from her window in Hampden swing housing. That day, she mostly stayed indoors and avoided the dining halls, she said.
McConnell, an inactive Crimson editorial editor, ended up writing her thesis about the aftermath of the bombings, focusing on the emotional response of the residents of Watertown, where Tsarnaev was eventually discovered.
“I felt a lot of things toward [Tsarnaev] that made me uncomfortable,” said McConnell, who is from Boston. “He wrestled with my best friend's boyfriend. He was the running partner of my mom’s co-worker’s son...It very much felt like he could have been someone I grew up with.”
McConnell does not support the death penalty. She said she is upset with the decision to keep the trial in Boston, where she said it might be harder for Tsarnaev to get an unbiased trial.
“I think he did it; I think it’s horrifying that he did it,” she said. “I also think that it's important for us to recognize that he’s still a human being.”
Henry C. Cousins ’17, for his part, is open to the death penalty. He said that while he is from Boston, the attack did not necessarily feel personal, a fact that does not change his animosity towards Tsarnaev.
“I would certainly consider [the death penalty],” he said. “I certainly can’t make a statement like that until I understand the case fully, but...I don't think [the death penalty] would be out of the question.”
In opening statements, Tsarnaev’s defense admitted his guilt, in an apparent attempt to sway jurors away from the death penalty. Witnesses are currently being examined in the guilt phase of the trial. If he is convicted, the jury of 12 will then decide whether he receives a death sentence.
“This is a historic case, no matter what your interest is,” said Harrison D. Phelps ’18, a resident of Easton, Mass. “This is going to be one of the most important cases in U.S. history.”

Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Kang-Kuen Ni was recently named an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow, one of four Harvard affiliates to receive the honor.
Ni, a member of the Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms, plans on using the fellowship—which comes with a $50,000 grant—to continue pursuing her research in ultracold atoms and to construct a simpler and more time-efficient apparatus for creating an environment for the atoms. Ni believes that with a deeper understanding of ultracold molecules, other physical systems and processes like quantum simulation and superfluidity may be better understood.
Although Ni works as a professor in the Chemistry department, her research, which she began in graduate school at the University of Colorado Boulder, is more closely related to physics.
“We are interested in making molecules and atoms really cold because that’s when they behave more quantum mechanically,” Ni said earlier this month. “In the quantum regime, the particles act more like waves, but the rate of chemical reaction can be very similar for other reactions happening at room temperature.”
In recent years, Ni’s research collaboration, also known as Ni Group, has been particularly interested in finding a more efficient apparatus of producing ultracold atoms. Ni said the fellowship will help the development of this new method.
“It is certainly a great honor to receive such a prestigious fellowship, and especially knowing that a lot of really great scientists came before [me],” Ni said.
Ni added that the funding will, if all goes to plan, allow her to accelerate her research.
“In the past, the apparatus usually takes about five to six years to build. Now, we are hoping to have that time saved with the new apparatus. We hope by building the new apparatus, we could save a few years,” Ni said.
With the refined apparatus, Ni believes ultracold molecules may be easily recreated and studied to understand other physical systems.
“There is a lot of potential once we have this kind of molecule at this temperature to study,” she said. “The nice thing about ultracold atoms is that the electrons in metals are very dirty—there are a lot of non-ideal things. But, in our system, we have neutral atoms that can be cooled to cold temperatures and arranged in any way that we want.”
Ni said that the goal is to have the molecules serve as a model "for more exotic physical systems that we don't really understand."

President Barack Obama unveiled several new initiatives Tuesday which focus on making college more affordable and helping students pay back incurred debt.
In a speech at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Obama called his efforts “a student aid bill of rights” and said a college education is critical for today’s workforce but more costly than ever.
“Higher education has never been more important, but it’s also never been more expensive,” Obama said, according to a White House transcript of the remarks. “The average undergrad who borrows money to pay for college graduates with about $28,000 in student loan debt.”
Obama tasked Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ’87 with creating a feedback and complaint system where loan borrowers can comment on federal loan lenders, collections agencies, or colleges themselves. By October 2017, per Obama’s memorandum, the Department of Education will publish a report summarizing comments and the responses provided. Obama has directed Duncan to publish a performance report on private debt collection agencies used by the department by 2016.
Obama outlined proposals to increase disclosures when people fail to make loan repayments or do not finish applications for repayment plants. The memorandum also called for Duncan to establish “as soon as practicable” a centralized place for federal loan borrowers to view their loan and payment information.
“We’re going to mobilize a coalition around this country to get this process moving, because there are a lot of good ideas right now but they’re stalled, or they’re happening piecemeal, or they’re happening in one university, or they’re happening in one state, and they have to happen everywhere,” Obama said in his speech.
Obama’s focus on higher education is not new. In his January state of the union address, he unveiled a plan to offer two years of free community college to students. During Obama’s presidency, the Department of Education has, among other things, raised the maximum amount for federal pell grant awards, shortened the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, overseen college affordability “scorecards,” and launched a $75 million program to provide funding for universities across the nation to develop programs at making college more affordable.
In response to Obama’s outlined initiatives, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an email that most Harvard students graduate without debt. About 70 percent of students receive some form of aid, and the financial aid office does not expect any students to take out loans, according to the the College’s financial aid website.
Still, qualifying students may take out federal loans or fixed five percent interest rate Harvard loans up to the amount they are expected to earn from term or summer work or savings. The median amount of federal loans a family borrows to finance a Harvard undergraduate education is $11,000, and only 2.3 percent of students who take out federal loans end up defaulting on them within three years of starting the repayment process, according to the Department of Education’s online college scorecard.

UPDATED: March 12, 2015, at 12:38 a.m.
A Harvard Law School student group has signed an amici curiae brief—an independent legal document to lobby the Supreme Court—that advocates for the recognition of same-sex marriages in states that do not do so currently.
Members of Lambda, an LGBTQ student group at the Law School, collectively signed the brief after Sanford Heisler Kimpel LLP, the law firm that wrote the brief, asked for the group to endorse it, according to Sean M. Cuddihy ’11, co-president of the group.
In January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear oral arguments on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage, consolidating petitions from four separate states. In combining the four separate cases, the Court said it would hear arguments on two separate questions: whether same-sex marriage is a right granted by the Fourteenth Amendment and whether the fourteenth amendment requires states that do not perform same-sex marriages to recognize same-sex marriages performed out-of-state.
The submitted brief addresses the latter question, advocating that states with constitutional bans on same-sex marriage must recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, per the Fourteenth Amendment. LGBTQ groups at undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools from across the country—including Yale Law School and Stanford Law School— are listed on the brief, which argues that “non-recognition laws amplify the preexisting discriminatory barriers LGBT individuals already face already face in obtaining employment, keeping their jobs, and advancing in their professions.”
In an emailed statement, Cuddihy wrote that the “harmful effects of patchwork marriage laws on young professionals and academics” are “highly relevant to many of [Lambda’s] members.”
Cuddihy wrote that if the case comes to the question of interstate marriage—only relevant if it does not grant a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in all states—the brief provides an “innovative” treatment of the issue.
After the Court decided earlier this year to hear oral arguments on same-sex marriage, several Law School professors predicted a historic ruling in favor of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To casual fans of No. 18/- Harvard men’s hockey team, it looked simple at the surface. Sophomore Luke Esposito flung a shot at Brown’s goaltender Tim Ernst. It ricocheted into the slot, where fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell collected the puck and whipped it past the outstretched glove of Ernst to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead—one that it would not surrender the rest of the game on Friday night.
But below the surface, it was more than just a goal. It was the culmination of a two-year journey.
Blackwell notched two goals on Friday and the game-winner on Saturday to help Harvard (17-11-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) sweep Brown (8-20-3, 5-14-3) in the first round of the ECAC Tournament to keep the Crimson's NCAA Tournament berth hopes alive.
“[Those were] huge games for us,” Blackwell said. “Last night, we didn’t want to make a three-game series. We had an opportunity to close the door and we proved that we could do that against a good team.”
The team had come into the series against the Bears in an offensive rut, having only put up more than two goals twice in its final five games of the regular season. When elimination was looming on the horizon, the team found an offensive spark from the most unlikely of sources.
The output wasn’t unlikely in terms of the player’s skill set. Instead, the surprise was the fact that he suited up to play in the first place.
After solid freshman and sophomore campaigns where he averaged 16.5 points per season, the North Andover, Mass. native was sidelined for his junior year due to upper body injuries. He played one game this year—a matchup against Bentley—before heading to the bench again with injuries. He finally returned to action during the final weekend of the season. But the Crimson eased the senior back into action, placing him on the fourth line for Friday night’s game. Blackwell skated well, but both No. 11/12 Quinnipiac and Princeton did not allow him to get a shot off.
“Even out there [that weekend] from the get-go, he was making plays and moving his feet,” co-captain Max Everson said. “You could tell right away that he was one of the better thinkers out there on the ice.”
The same cannot be said about his performance in his two games against the Bears.
The San Jose Sharks prospect was moved to the second line for the weekend and played a critical role on in both games on the weekend for Harvard. After his first goal gave the Crimson a two-goal advantage in the series opener, he connected again—this time on a drop-pass from Esposito rather than a shot rebound—to beat Ernst for the second time on the night and give Harvard an insurmountable four-goal lead in the third period.
“It’s been a long time so I was just happy to be out there and be contributing to the team,” Blackwell said. “I was fired up for us to get the sweep.”
The next night was more of the same from Blackwell. The senior ripped a wrister past Ernst to give the Crimson what was at the time a three-goal lead in the second period. But the goal turned out to give Harvard just enough cushion, as Brown would go on to make a late charge, notching two more goals over the course of the next two stanzas but ultimately fell short of finding the equalizer to send the game into overtime.
His impact was apparent beyond the box score as well. His speed was too much to handle for the Bears, as Blackwell drew crucial penalty calls for the Crimson, including one that led to his first goal since Jan. 2013.
“He’s a terrific hockey player,” junior forward Jimmy Vesey said. “I think that having him back in the lineup just adds another element of speed and skill and solidifies our depth as a whole.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third year in a row, the Harvard women’s hockey team has punched a ticket to the NCAA tournament. Following a 7-3 win over Cornell in the ECAC Championship game Sunday, the Crimson clinched the No. 3 seed and home ice advantage for the first round of the tournament.
“Hearing we got the number three seed was pretty exciting,” junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer said. “Getting any kind of seed in the tournament is a great feeling, just knowing you’re in the NCAA tournament. No matter what seed we got, we knew it was going to be a great opportunity.”
Harvard (25-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) will be facing off against ECAC rival Quinnipiac (26-8-3, 15-5-2) at 4 p.m. at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Saturday. This is the first time in program history that the Bobcats have made it in to the tournament, while this trip marks the 11th time the Crimson has punched a ticket.
For Harvard, the stage set for the opening round will be full of familiarities, as Saturday’s showdown on home ice is the fourth time the Crimson will have faced Quinnipiac this season. Most recently, the teams met each other in the semifinal round of the ECAC playoff on March 7, where Harvard was able to skate by with a 2-1 win in overtime.
In fact, the last two times these teams have taken opposing benches, the games have required an extra frame of play.
“They’re not a super flashy team,” freshman forward Karly Heffernan said of the Bobcats. “They work hard, and I think that’s kind of our game too. They’re a good team to play against, and we’ve gone into OT against them two games in a row, so we can expect something like that again.... Hopefully we can jump out and get the first goal, which usually leads us to a win.”
Scoring early has not been the Crimson’s strong suit in the games leading up to the tournament. Both the ECAC playoff matchups Harvard played in last weekend saw the Crimson go down early, 1-0, in the first period, forcing the team to play catch up with its opponent.
This weekend, with the season on the line, coming out with a dominant performance in the first period will be key for the team to move on in the tournament.
“I think getting the first goal is always key,” Maschmeyer said. “It’s tough when they score first because you have to shift the momentum. As a goalie, it’s not a good feeling, but you have to move on and make the next save or in the offensive case the next play.”
Throughout the season, Maschmeyer has been an essential component to Harvard’s success. In the 23 games she has appeared in for the Crimson, she has allowed only 33 goals, averaging one-and-a-half goals scored against per game. Her .941 save percentage has landed her just a hair behind Clarkson goalie Shea Tiley’s save percentage of .942 for the best in the conference.
On the offensive side of the puck, Harvard has seen contribution come from a spread of players across different lines. Senior defenseman Sarah Edney, junior forward Miye D’Oench, and junior forward Mary Parker were all awarded spots on the ECAC All-Tournament team, tallying four, three, and five points, respectively, during last weekend’s games. Parker leads the team in total points with 37, while D’Oench’s 19 goals in her junior campaign is tops on the team.
One of the Crimson’s strengths throughout the season has been its ability to convert on man-up advantages during power plays. During the season, the team has been able to score a power play goal almost a quarter of the time, with the percentage coming in over 25 percent when looking at conference games.
On the other side of the coin, all three of the Big Red’s goals against Harvard on Sunday afternoon came off the power play, leaving work to be done in situations where the team is shorthanded.
“We can focus on our penalty kill and power play a lot [in practice] because we can expect to have some power plays and penalty kills against them because it’s always an aggressive game when we play,” Heffernan said.
After coming off of a long road trip for the ECAC playoffs, the Crimson has the advantage of skating on home ice in the opening round of the tournament.
“With home ice you have our home fans which is great because the energy is always awesome in our rink,” Maschmeyer said. “Just the familiarity with having our own locker room and being able to do our own warm up is great, and it’s what we want because it’s what we always have [that] makes it great to play at home.”
Ultimately, the No. 3 bid puts Harvard one step closer to the goal set at the beginning of the year—to be contenders for a national championship. A win means advancement to the Frozen Four, while falling to the Bobcats would bring an end to the Crimson’s season.
“We’re a pretty good team when it comes to playing in do or die situations,” Heffernan said. “We are good at playing desperate hockey, so I think we’ll have the advantage and momentum going in.”

As of today, freshmen officially know where they'll be living for the next three years (or where they'll be trying to transfer out of). Blocking groups have been formed, inevitable blocking drama has been avoided (or resulted in last minute chaos), and housing forms have been submitted– complete with the infamous blocking group names.
Below, Flyby presents an analysis of the Class of 2018, based solely on the names they have decided on for their blocking groups. If you’ve ever wondered exactly what types of people make up the freshman class, look no further:
The AcademicsContrary to popular belief, the Class of 2018 seems to have its fair share of nerds. After all, who doesn’t love a good science pun?
The PunnyThese references are on point though:
The Aspiring RappersClass of 2018 soon to drop the most fire mixtape of the century. Featured artists and titles include:
The UnoriginalsComing up with a name for your blocking group can definitely be a stressful process. However, I’m guessing these guys either left this until the last minute, or realized how little blocking names actually matter.
The UncategorizableSome groups really brought their creative A game, but didn’t quite fall into any of the above categories. We thought they still deserved some recognition.
Good work, freshmen. We’ll see if the Class of 2019 can live up to the standards you’ve set.

Happy Wednesday, Harvard, and happy Housing Day Eve! Wearing your pajamas inside out isn’t going to appease the River Gods (and turns out River Run probably won’t either; it’ll just get you UHS’ed or stopped by HUPD), so just try not to be those kids that cry when they get the quad.

Now that all the videos are out and Housing Day is fast upon us, our Flyby writers Jalin and Eva have produced the definitive ranking of the videos. Trust us, they’re experts (freshmen).
1. Dunster
Eva: I’ve been a big fan of my homegirl TSwift since 6th grade, so there was no way that a “Blank Space” parody wasn’t going to be my #1. Plus, fake Taylor Swift has some serious vocal talent. And PSA to the guy in the video: I’m super single, you know, if you’re looking for a nightmare dressed like a daydream…
Jalin: Unlike Eva, I have not yet hopped on the Taylor Swift train, but I can give credit where credit is due. This video was amazing, considering it was primarily shot on a construction site. Other houses, take a hard look in the mirror.
2. Cabot
Eva: Two words: Song. Choices. Just so on point. People from Cabot also released a couple other videos but this one was definitely my favorite. Dean Khurana’s cameo is hilarious, as are the ripped up fur coat and the Audi. The video doesn’t take itself too seriously, which I appreciate.
Jalin: This one had pretty low production value, but it looks like they had fun with it. Plus, I’m always down for nice cars and cameos from the Khuranas. The unofficial Cabot video was also a total winner.
3. Pfoho
Eva: I was down with this video pretty much the second I heard the opening chords to “All Star,” and it just got better from there. Love the throwbacks, and the fact that you can understand what everyone is singing.
Jalin: Who doesn’t love an early 2000s throwback? I’m usually not one for medleys, but Pfoho really killed it with this one. Extra points for appropriate uses of both tie-dye and jorts.
4. Lowell
Eva: I was a little confused by the Christmas carol at the beginning, but I am in full support of Flo Rida parodies (Pretty sure I hadn’t head “Low” since seventh grade bar mitzvah season…#tbt to bad haircuts and bad style). But nothing is going to beat “Get Lowell,” although “Drunk in Lowell” came close. This year’s was good, it just didn’t meet the absurdly high standards set by past years.
Jalin: Cutest little kid and housemaster appearances by far, but until the royal blue jumpsuits see another day, I don’t know if I can get 100% behind Lowell’s efforts. Also, we get that your d-hall is yellow. I promise.
5. Adams
Eva: I get how this video was divisive, especially since it dropped after Mather’s. I did like that for a "50 Shades of Grey" theme, it was pretty tasteful (but maybe that’s just relative to Mather’s), and I thought the awkward elevator scene/serious shade thrown at Mather was funny. And come on, it’s Adams, of course it’s going to be a little pretentious.
Jalin: I just don’t know about this one. On one hand, I, like Eva, was grateful for the absence of human-animal hookups, but I couldn’t quite get on board with the 30-second long elevator scene in dead silence.
6. Kirkland
Eva: I wish the song choice had been more recognizable, but the kids were super adorable though– they definitely made the video. HoCo did a good job of making the House look like a community.
Jalin: This was better than “We Didn’t Start the Kirkland,” and that’s all that matters. I wasn’t a huge fan of the song choice, but Kirkland’s HoCo did a good enough job of including snuggly footage from Kirkland residents, cute kids, and cult-y chants to get me excited.
7. Winthrop
Eva: So much Taylor Swift in this year’s Housing Video market and I love it. Winthrop’s looked like a lot of fun to make, and as a laughably bad dancer, I feel like I really related to this video.
Jalin: A tad disappointing since Winthrop KILLED IT last year with their one-take rendition of “Love On Top,” but still a decent video that seemed like a lot of fun to make. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t laugh at the “Allston Burr ‘I’m Just Here So I Don’t Get Fined’ Resident Dean.”
8. Leverett
Eva: Wasn’t a huge fan. But maybe I’m just scarred from my Physics Night experiences in Lev d-hall last semester.
Jalin: Pretty standard job from Lev on this one. I was digging the flashy bunny ears though.
9. Quincy
Eva: I really love Uptown Funk (oh, sorry, FunQ) so I really wanted to like this video. The dancers have got moves, but I felt like the video was kind of lacking in entertainment otherwise (Did we really need a full minute of people singing in the gym to point out how infrequently we will actually use the gym?). At least it had less poorly attempted twerking than their other video.
Jalin: Why’d you let me down like that, Quincy? Uptown Funk is prime Housing Day song material, and they came out with that nonsense? As per usual, I liked the multitude of penguin appearances, but the video’s lead looked as if he had just rummaged through the Quincy lost and found.
10. Mather
Eva: Oh my god. Honestly, my first mistake was definitely watching this while procrastinating in Lamont, because I was so mortified that someone would look over my shoulders and judge me forever. The production value of this video is super high, but I just felt so icky after watching it that I really just couldn’t get into it. Whoever thought that making out with a gorilla would make freshmen want to live in your house is a sick, sick person.
Jalin: What, Mather? The “50 Shades of Grey” premise had so much potential! (I’m looking at you too, Adams) I can always count on Mather to make something as innocent as a housing day video scar me for life. Know your mascot. Know your audience.
11. Eliot
Eva: I am so down with #tbts in general, and especially Outkast (you’ll find me most Friday nights begging various DJs to play “Hey Ya”), but I was disappointed that so much of the footage was recycled from last year’s housing day.
Jalin: Nice try with the Outkast #tbt, but this just did not do it for me. You can only do broad pans of your dhall and past Housing Day footage for so long.
12. Currier
Eva: Honestly, I just didn’t even know what was going on here. Plus, the song got stuck in my head for hours while I was trying to write an Expos paper. Thanks, but no thanks.
Jalin: Oh, Currier. Just pick a normal song next time.
