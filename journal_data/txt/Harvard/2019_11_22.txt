After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On November 3, the Harvard Political Review published an article titled “Renaissance for Rwanda’s Dogs.” This article hailed an apparent positive shift in the Rwandan perception of dogs. The article first references the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi and its aftermath as context to claim that since the genocide, Rwandans have had a “widespread aversion” to dogs. It then jumps to the present and claims that thanks to “American and European expats,” i.e. white expats, whose population size has been growing in recent years, Rwandans are being introduced to “dogs as companions for the first time.” The article calls this a cultural shift that “[reflects] broader dynamics around Westernization and development in Rwanda.”
Not only is this narrative plain false, it is deeply offensive. As a son of genocide survivors who grew up in post-genocide Rwanda, I was not only surprised by this article’s push for a false and problematic narrative concerning Rwandans’ relationship to dogs, but I found the use of the genocide and its aftermath to magnify these unfounded claims troublingly insensitive.
My first objection is the notion that white expats are shifting the way Rwandans perceive dogs. The very claim that the love for dogs in Rwanda is a new trend is unfounded, let alone the claim that white expats are shifting Rwanda’s perception of dogs. I grew up in a low income family in Kicukiro, Rwanda. Since the 2000s, my siblings and I have had three dogs, and this was not unusual for a typical family in the capital city, Kigali. There were many other dogs in my neighborhood, including strays, household dogs, and guard dogs. Yes, as in any society, there were cases of dog abuse and mistreatment but those were exceptions and not a trend. The claim that Rwandans had a “widespread aversion” to dogs prior to this new “cultural shift” initiated by white expats is unfounded. This article did not include extensive research on the topic but instead only had interviews from workers in dog rescue non-profit founded by Canadians. It was clear to me that this article was propagating a specific narrative that corroborates false assumptions and undermines Rwandans’ relationship with dogs while magnifying the importance of white expats.
My second objection to this narrative is that even if these claims were true, linking this apparent cultural shift to “Westernization and development” is disturbing. The notion that Africans are developing the more they reflect Western ways of life and adopt Western cultures is at the very least a sign of Western cultural imperialism and it is not new. For years, this is the same ideology that has been used to defend European colonialism and subsequent imperialist tendencies towards African nations. It is based on the belief that African development and cultural advancement should reflect white American and European culture. This belief is, at its core, racist.
What frustrates me most, however, is the fact that the article references the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi and its aftermath to promote an unfounded narrative. Throughout the article, the genocide is continuously mentioned as the reason behind the alleged aversion of dogs in Rwanda. The article uses this important part of Rwanda’s past as an easy way to push a poorly-sourced narrative. This may not sounds significant to an average non-Rwandan reader, but for many Rwandans, the psychological and spiritual wounds of the genocide are still fresh. Twenty-five years after the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi, millions of Rwandans are still dealing with the effects of the genocide and many, including my family members, are still struggling with its psychological trauma.
Reading an article which uses the pain and loss of millions of Rwandans as a hook to promote a poorly sourced narrative about dogs in Rwanda was personally hurtful. It trivialized the countless lives of Rwandans who were massacred in the genocide and the trauma of genocide survivors.
This type of insensitive reporting is, unfortunately, not new. A good example is the 1994 New York Times article that covered the genocide against the Tutsi as it was happening. This article’s focus was on the safety of 2,850 Americans and Europeans in Rwanda, while hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were being killed on the ground. To this day, there is still persistent careless and insensitive coverage of African issues in Western media mostly driven by ignorance and, sometimes, by racist assumptions.
African stories deserve nuanced and thorough reporting. As Harvard students and future leaders, we must be conscious of our biases and seek to report accurately and fairly. Failure to do so will produce insensitive, detrimental and, at times, racist narratives that affect the subjects of our reporting. Publications like the Harvard Political Review should be held to the same standard whether reporting African issues or Western ones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, organizers of Divest Harvard poured molasses, intended to symbolize oil, on themselves during a protest in front of Smith Campus Center. The demonstration comes on the heels of the Undergraduate Council election, in which nearly 70 percent of voting students were in favor of a referendum calling on Harvard to commit to and develop a clear divestment plan by Earth Day 2020. A similar referendum the previous year garnered 71.5 percent support.
In the wake of two overwhelmingly supportive referenda for fossil fuel divestment and months and years of pressure and protest by very vocal advocates, we have yet to see concerted efforts made by the administration to address the status quo of the University’s investment position. In fact, this event and the response from the administration or, rather, the lack thereof precisely highlight the lack of power that students have when advocating for important and consequential changes on our campus.
As we have previously opined, the role of student activism is to challenge the prevailing order and understanding of current norms. Inherent in this conception of protest is the recognition that student activists are already fighting an uphill battle against the inertia of the status quo. But as members of the Harvard community, students and their opinions on the University’s policies are crucial components of the commitment to dialogue that undergirds our communal life, and we believe that there is a need for greater student input in administrative processes.
In the meantime, working outside of the school’s administrative system, Divest Harvard’s persistence in campus protest and advocacy has allowed students to be heard. By employing a diverse range of tactics — the mock oil spill, for example, is a powerful, symbolic, even artistic expression of discontent — Divest Harvard has captured the attention of the campus and can hopefully move the needle on this issue, in spite of of the vast power disadvantage at which protesters find themselves.
More than the immediate efficacy of the divest protest, we also see a large educational value in engaging in student activism. On every college campus around the country and the world, learning how to be an activist and to express oneself is a critical part of nurturing the future of the democratic process. And perhaps in this sense protesters should be recognized for doing precisely what the University has claimed as its own response to climate change: “Pursu[ing] a range of innovative and ambitious efforts to accelerate the world’s transition to renewable sources of energy and to help mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change that are already being realized.”
Moving forward, we remain supportive and hopeful about Divest Harvard’s efforts to urge the University to divest. But as previous and current protests prove ineffective and more disruptive means of protest, expressing disillusionment, and exerting pressure may seem an increasingly compelling option, we believe that conversations about the Divest Harvard’s methods for protest and their goals warrant further discussion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In my family, we know to not get sick.”
The college adviser’s words were met with silence. I glanced at the printed out version of the Common Application in my hands, unsure what made me more nervous — the many questions on the form, or my own ignorance on how to even begin answering them. I hadn’t realized that healthcare insurance was yet another aspect I needed to consider.
My worries seemed reflected by the rest of the students in the room. We were all a part of a college advising program, one specifically catered towards first-generation, low-income students who were unsure on how to navigate the road to higher education. Our advisor was a vibrant woman with enough energy to command the attention of a whole class of high-schoolers, an impressive feat in the mid-autumn season when the days were short and attentions were bound to wander. I particularly appreciated how she carried herself with bold fashion tastes and uncensored honesty — divulging her experiences growing up without stable medical coverage, not to scare us, but rather to make us aware of a lived reality for so many.
According to the United States census in 2018, 27.5 million Americans were reported to not have health insurance at any point during the year. At the start of my freshman year, I could be considered among these ranks when I did not purchase dental coverage in my student health insurance plan.
It was not a difficult decision to make.
When I was going through my package at the start of the term, I scanned through my benefits and noted the absence of dental coverage with mild confusion. It turned out that oral healthcare fell under the category of “optional” for Harvard students — but for those with backgrounds that couldn’t afford the separate pricing, it wasn’t so much an option as it was a decisive “no.”
Like most things in healthcare, dentistry comes attached with an intimidating price: According to one insurance company’s website, “a simple checkup costs only an average of about $85-$100 in the U.S., fillings run approximately $230-$300, and crowns go for $1,100 and up.” I can’t describe what it is like to sit with yourself, staring at a screen with numbers that sit heavy in the pit of your stomach.
In that moment, you make an intentional choice to risk a part of your well-being because you do not want to be a financial burden. You tell yourself that you’ll take such good care of your health that a medical authority won’t be necessary. And yet, the statistics are not in your favor. Studies have indicated that a lack of dental care can have huge health implications on the rest of your body. Not only are individuals missing preventative check-ins on gum disease by visiting the dentist less, “but people who do not have dental benefits are more likely to suffer from other, non-dental-related diseases” such as heart disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes.
Perhaps it was only the natural course for me to run into teeth troubles a few years down the line. Like all health issues, my first defense was to ignore it until it would go away, except the pain on the upper right side of my mouth persisted in this case. Enough that I finally caved and checked out the problem through Harvard University Health Services, earning quite an earful about my negligence from the dental assistants in the process. They suggested that I was too young to be so reckless with my teeth, and strapped to a dental chair with an X-ray to my right and microscope glaring down from the top, I felt so exposed, unable to tell them that I hadn’t been to a dentist in three years because I couldn’t afford it.
It is a rather unfair thing — how one part of your body can have such a profound impact on the rest of it. The connections of your bones and muscles and organs make it impossible to neglect one over the other, to choose to risk even one part of your body. And yet many of us still have to make these choices since our circumstances deal with a country without universal healthcare. Some of us know not to get sick because it is not possible to afford such a price for the bare minimum of our physical well-being.
I have been operating with this mantra for a few years now, just for a thing as simple as my oral health, and still it is not a lifestyle I would recommend. I am told to offer solutions in my columns, but even raising problems can be taboo — especially in a case like this when the fault is always misdirected back to the patient, shaming that one person for not being more vigilant with her body, instead of faulting the overarching institution of healthcare that simply does not support every person. But I will assert that Harvard could do better and start by adding dental coverage for all students in their health care package. Beyond the University though, that’s a decision we have yet to see play out — just be sure to stay healthy while you wait.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vice Provost for Research Richard D. McCullough said in an interview Thursday that in recent years, Congress and federal funding agencies have imposed increased scrutiny of science research at Harvard and other research institutions.
McCullough pointed to a warning FBI director Christopher A. Wray issued early last year at a congressional hearing about the threat of intellectual property theft as the start of heightened scrutiny, which McCullough described as a bipartisan effort.
“They have expressed, you know, a lot of concern about certain activities that might threaten what they say will be in the national security,” McCullough said.
A congressional report released Monday concluded that the United States government had failed to prevent China from stealing intellectual property from American universities and does not have a “comprehensive strategy” to deal with the threat.
“U.S. universities and U.S.-based researchers must take responsibility in addressing this threat,” the report reads. “If U.S. universities can vet employees for scientific rigor or allegations of plagiarism, they also can vet for financial conflicts of interests and foreign sources of funding.”
The report also called on the FBI to more regularly and effectively warn research institutions about the threat. Tthe National Institutes of Health is currently investigating potential intellectual theft at more than 70 American universities.
In the past year, Harvard has formed two committees to review and implement changes to research grant compliance procedures, specifically for federal funding. One committee, overseen by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, has strengthened oversight of grant submissions, according to Dean of the Sciences Christopher W. Stubbs.
The other committee — which McCullough co-directs with Vice Provost of International Affairs Mark C. Elliott — seeks to complement existing oversight structures, including the “provostial review” process which applies to certain research projects that seek external funding.
“We’re just putting extra eyes on things,” McCullough said. “We're protecting the faculty. Our job is to make sure that they don't do something by accident and ruin their reputation.”
The NIH’s and FBI’s inquiries have focused almost exclusively on scientists of Chinese descent — some of whom are naturalized American citizens — whom they allege have funneled sensitive information to the Chinese government.
Stubbs announced at a faculty meeting earlier this month that the NIH has inquired about potential discrepancies in grant proposals at Harvard. It is unclear whether the NIH or FBI is investigating any researchers at Harvard.
McCullough cautioned Thursday against casting all research conducted with foreign scientists as worthy of dismissal or suspect treatment.
“Openness and collaboration with other countries, including China, is important for advancing healthcare and science writ large,” he said.
McCullough added that Harvard largely relies on the federal government to vet foreign researchers and visitors.
“We depend on the visa system as a way to figure out who should be here and who should not be here,” he said. “We’re not in the business of policing.”
McCullough, who participates in a roundtable group of administrators at roughly a dozen elite research institutions called the Ivy-Plus Research Officer Group, said the threat of intellectual theft has emerged as a “major topic” of discussion among academics.
“Half of the meetings we spend trying to figure this stuff out,” McCullough said. “Everybody’s trying to just get their head around this, to make sure that you're, you know, partners with the United States government.”

Munching on donuts and facing off on arcade machines, students partook in daily Harvard-Yale Spirit Week events this week in anticipation of the 136th Harvard-Yale Football Game Friday.
Spirit Week is an annual tradition organized by the Crimson Traditions Committee of the College Events Board intended to generate school pride and get undergraduates excited for the upcoming Game, according to CEB member Emily G. Lopez ’21.
Each year, the CEB chooses a theme to center Spirit Week around and plans five daily events preceding the Game. This year, the committee decided on “Road to Victory” as a theme to bring out Harvard students’ competitive spirit as they journey to Yale, Lopez said. The group used competitive race car driving as a recurring symbol of the theme.
Spirit Week kicked off Monday with an event called “Road Trip,” which encouraged friendly competition over various arcade games at Dave & Buster’s, a restaurant and video arcade chain.
“We chose Dave & Buster’s because, first of all, it’s just really, really fun. And it also gets that competitive side of people out because there’s like a bunch of sports games there and like competing games,” said Lopez.
The committee also created a new event called “Ride or DIY” where students could make their own apparel to represent school spirit at the Game. CEB provided bandanas, fanny packs, bracelet making supplies, and decals for students to decorate their own clothes.
“This was very different from anything we had ever done before, as we tried to create more Harvard gear for students because we understand like going to the Coop is super expensive,” said Lopez.
According to Lopez, as of Wednesday, the event with the biggest turnout was “Stay in Your Lane Yale,” an annual tradition featuring Organismic and Evolutionary Biology lecturer Andrew J. Berry performing a roast of Yale.
Held in the Smith Campus Center, the event brought together many students who ate snacks as they listened to an opening stand-up comedy act by Tom L. Osborn ’20, saw the premiere of on-campus comedy group On Harvard Time’s “The Game” video, and watched Berry’s act, which was accompanied by a slideshow presentation.
“What do all Harvard and Yale students have in common? They all got into Yale,” Berry said, reading off of a projected image of a T-shirt in his closing remarks.
Some students who attended the event — including Berry’s students — said they enjoyed the lecturer’s jabs at Yale.
“I have a gen-ed class with Andrew Berry and he’s like one of the funniest people I know,” Elijah B. McGill ’23 said. “I thought [his jokes] were quite on point for his character, and I thought that they were quite funny. Lots of good ammunition, I guess, for any Yale person you meet.”
Overall, Lopez said she is happy with the turnout at CEB’s events throughout the week.
“We love seeing anyone and all people come,” she said. “We really want to focus on spirit and hyping up Harvard and the Game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Assistant Professor of Sociology and Social Studies Christina Ciocca Eller presented research on how colleges and universities can find better performance measures in a lecture on inequality in higher education Thursday evening.
In the study she presented, Ciocca Eller used year-long interviews with students from urban, public college systems and university administrative data to compare graduation rates and overall success of students from different racial groups across schools. Using this data, Ciocca Eller said she hopes to provide more clear measurements of college effectiveness than the current ranking system.
Ciocca Eller identified two major problems with colleges and universities’ current performance metrics. First, she said student outcomes reported by universities are collected by organizations like the National Center for Education Statistics and U.S. News and World Report using aggregate data.
“I like to call these ice cream sundae measures,” Ciocca Eller said. “We really don't know if it's students pre-college characteristics, the selection process between the student and the college, or the college itself that is exerting this aggregate effect that we see most likely to be reported.”
She added that administrators’ awareness of potential issues in student outcome reports creates another problem. As administrators realize the potentially negative impact of reports on potential applicants, they may cater organizational changes toward improving reports rather than actual outcomes. She calls this phenomenon “superficial recoupling.”
“What you get here is a similar kind of pressure being put on colleges and universities to give over outcome data — to look very closely at it and say, ‘what can I send to the world to try to make myself look a certain way on paper?’” Ciocca Eller said.
Ciocca Eller said she focused on urban college systems because they frequently have a large population of underrepresented minority students and are often overlooked in college rankings.
“One, they're just huge. On an annual basis, if we were to combine the public college populations of New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami, it's over 600,000 students served a year,” Ciocca Eller said. “Second of all, it serves a very high proportion of students who are considered underrepresented in higher ed, both by their income and by their racial background.”
Ciocca Eller said she thinks more researchers should focus on how these universities can improve.
“We really have an opportunity to think about what is not going as well as it could be in better you in order to produce even greater utilization,” she said.
In order to improve student success, Ciocca Eller said universities should implement methods of measuring student outcome that keep administrators accountable.
Ciocca Eller also proposed a new model which she said allows her to statistically match students from different universities and track academic success across schools in order to isolate how university policies affect student outcomes across racial and social groups.
“I’m using this kind of statistical matching or equalization in order to try to remove some of the bias that we would get from the selection process,” she said.
Graduate School of Education Professor Julie A. Reuben, who organized the talk, said she considers Ciocca Eller’s research vital to providing a more precise understanding of how well universities perform.
“I think what this research does is it begins to find ways of identifying whether institutions are serving their students — well, helping them achieve this goal of graduating — and breaking that down so we could see it by different groups of students and also by the different preparation levels that the students come in with,” Reuben said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced the creation of a University-wide initiative to address and further research the school’s ties to slavery in an email sent to Harvard affiliates Thursday.
Bacow selected Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin to be the head of a new University-wide faculty committee that will lead the initiative. The University has designated $5 million for the program, according to Bacow’s email.
“It is my hope that the work of this new initiative will help the university gain important insights about our past and the enduring legacy of slavery — while also providing an ongoing platform for our conversations about our present and our future as a university community committed to having our minds opened and improved by learning,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow wrote that the Radcliffe Institute will work closely with library and museum staff to host both programs and academic opportunities related to the issue.
“By engaging a wide array of interests and expertise, as Radcliffe is uniquely suited to do, this initiative will reflect the remarkable power of bringing together individuals from across Harvard in pursuit of a common purpose,” he wrote.
Other faculty on the 12-person committee include former Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
Bacow’s announcement comes as the University continues to grapple with its ties to slavery. In March, Connecticut resident Tamara K. Lanier filed a lawsuit against Harvard alleging the University unlawfully owns and profits off photos of enslaved people who she says are her ancestors.
Earlier this month, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda penned a letter to Bacow demanding reparations from Harvard for its historical ties to slavery.
In his letter, Bacow also wrote about efforts that former University President Drew G. Faust spearheaded several years ago like installing memorials commemorating enslaved individuals at Wadsworth House and Harvard Law School, and creating a faculty committee to study the University’s ties to slavery.
In February 2016, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced that faculty leaders of the 12 undergraduate houses would be renamed “Faculty Deans” — a shift away from the former term “House Master,” which some students associated with slavery.
A month later, the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — agreed to remove the Law School’s controversial seal, which featured the crest of a slaveholding family. The decision came after pieces of black tape were found over the portraits of black Law School professors in November 2015 and months of student protests.
The initiative announced Thursday will focus on researching further the connections Harvard has to the slave trade and to abolition movements, Bacow said in his email.
“Harvard has a unique role in the history of our country, and we have a distinct obligation to understand how our traditions and our culture here are shaped by our past and by our surroundings — from the ways the university benefitted from the Atlantic slave trade to the debates and advocacy for abolition on camp,” Bacow wrote.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced the start of the search for the next Minister of the Memorial Church in an email to Harvard affiliates Thursday.
Jonathan L. Walton — who held the position from 2012 to 2019 — announced his departure in April in order to serve as Dean of Wake Forest University School of Divinity. Harvard Divinity School Professor Stephanie A. Paulsell, who is currently serving as interim minister of Memorial Church, assumed her post in August and will continue to serve while the University searches for a permanent replacement.
“I am deeply committed to finding a successor who can guide the church through the intricacies of today’s social and academic climate while furthering its mission of scholarship and service,” Bacow wrote in the email.
In his email, Bacow, who is the chair of the search committee for the next minister, announced the group’s other members. The “cross-sectional” committee includes professors and staff at the University, chaplains from multiple faith backgrounds, church congregants, and a student at the College.
Paulsell, who is also on the search committee, wrote in an email that she is “excited” for the search for a new minister.
“I'm hoping we find someone eager to engage the diversity of religious life at Harvard and to work creatively at the intersection of the church, the world, and the university,” Paulsell wrote. “I'm hoping for a minister who draws us more deeply into the life of the world, helps us feel the claim of the lives of others on our own, and invites us to explore the relationship between our intellectual and spiritual lives.”
Bacow also invited Harvard affiliates to provide input on the search regarding their thoughts on the future of the church and “essential qualities” in a new minister.
“The mission of Memorial Church is rooted in scholarship and service, and as part of a large interfaith network requires a leader who can balance tradition and innovation,” Bacow wrote.
Other members of the search committee include Harvard Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid, men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, Harvard School of Public Health Director of the Senior Leadership Fellows Program Eric R. Andersen, Professor Catherine A. Brekus ’85, Professor Cornell William Brooks, Reverend John H. Finley IV ’92, Memorial Church Student Advisory Board Member Alden Fossett ’21, Dean of the Faculty of Divinity David N. Hempton, Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer ’77, and Hillel Executive Director Jonah C. Steinberg.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard’s graduate student union prepares for a potential strike next month, organizers can look to several other graduate student unions across the country that have initiated work stoppages in recent years.
In the seven-year period from 2012 to 2018, there were seven work stoppages at colleges and universities in the United States, according to a recent study by William A. Herbert, director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions, and Jacob Apkarian, assistant professor at the City University of New York. The majority of them lasted less than a week, and the longest lasted 11 days.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers will join those ranks if it does not reach a contract agreement with the University by Dec. 3. The two sides remain deadlocked over key issues in the contract, including compensation, health benefits, and a procedure to resolve harassment and discrimination claims.
Members of Graduate Students United at the University of Chicago, which is not formally recognized as a union, initiated a work stoppage for the last three days of classes before finals in June to try to convince administrators to voluntarily recognize their union, according to GSU member Laura Colaneri.
Unlike Harvard’s union, which has vowed to strike indefinitely, GSU members only voted to authorize a three day stoppage, Colaneri said. Members ultimately decided not to extend the work stoppage into the finals period, fearing that this could adversely affect students’ ability to receive grades.
“It's sort of, you know, the really difficult exchange between showing the administration that what we do is important and obviously really valuing the work that you do and wanting to make sure that your students get the best, you know, education that they can,” Colaneri said.
During the stoppage, many classes taught by striking graduate students were canceled and research assistants in labs stopped their work unless “absolutely necessary,” according to Colaneri.
Colaneri said the University of Chicago administration responded “poorly” to the strike. The University asked faculty to track students’ hours during the strike in relation to grant funding, she said. Administrators also sent an email to undergraduates and parents asking them to report graduate student instructors who did not show up to classes, which Colaneri called “intimidation.”
“It was sort of clear that they were hoping to get people on their side in terms of pressuring against the union and trying to say, ‘oh, you're being disruptive to campus,’ ‘you're disrupting your students’ education,’” Colaneri said.
University of Chicago spokesperson Colleen Mastony did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the strike.
HGSU has shared concerns that Harvard will withhold pay from those who decide to strike.
“Other universities where student workers have gone on strike have set a precedent of not withholding pay, but we cannot guarantee what Harvard will or will not do,” a zine distributed by HGSU at an informational event about the strike Nov. 21 reads.
When asked whether students participating in a strike will be paid, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to a University website about the strike that indicates striking graduate students “may risk not being paid.”
Graduate student workers at Columbia University also held a six-day strike April 2018 due to the university’s refusal to recognize and bargain with its graduate student union. During the strike, graduate student workers on strike also withheld their paid instructional and research work.
Harvard’s union has also published a document outlining how they would like faculty members to support the strike. In the document, union organizers asked faculty members to not replace striking student workers during the strike, and to not identify student workers on strike to University administrators.
When graduate student workers went on strike at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign for nearly two weeks between February and March 2018, several faculty members supported striking students by moving classes off campus, according to Sara Feldman, a preceptor in Yiddish at Harvard who was a non-tenure-track faculty member at UIUC from 2015 to 2018.
“Among the faculty that I knew, I didn't know any other faculty who were not doing that,” she said.
UIUC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Feldman said that though moving classes was “disruptive,” students recognized that honoring the strike was “worth it” for education at large.
“The instructors' teaching conditions and working conditions are the students' learning conditions,” Feldman said.

Excluding ourselves from the present situation, with The Game but heartbeats away, it is pertinent to consider why it is that these two schools even meet on the gridiron once a year. Pride is the answer one receives at an inquiry of coaches, players, and alumni representing the respective institutions. Some others might attribute the annual meeting to the chance occasion of the two schools being chartered in a similar era amongst seven other colonial colleges, earning their respective spots in the Ivy League. This is of course true. Even though the Ivy League wasn’t formed officially until the middle of the 20th century, a yearly meeting between the two squads would be made more difficult by a difference of conferences. I, however, propose a different answer to the motivations behind The Game. Not one to abandon useless traditions, Harvard tolerates its antiquated rival; but Yale — Yale needs Harvard.
Divorced from the rest of society in the gothically adulterated city of New Haven, Yale finds itself with little advantages to market to potential students. In the middle of Connecticut, with no real city within an accessible distance, prospective Yale students must consent to a four-year sequestration from society in order to complete their undergraduate education. Despite this isolation, Yale manages to recruit a sizable amount of candidates (albeit it does accept a whopping 6.3 percent). No rational person can hope to explain this away with the supposed might of the Yale undergraduate academia. Take as proof the Economist’s college rankings which list Yale as number 1270 out of 1275 colleges.
Keeping Yale relevant, however, is one thing: its rivalry with Harvard. In naming it a rivalry, we are fundamentally engaging in a fallacy, as in every conceivable measure Harvard beats Yale. Look to the seat of government where Harvard boasts more presidents, legislators and Supreme Court justices. Look to Rhodes Scholars, Nobel Prizes, Ivy League titles, acceptance rates, projected income, name recognition, endowment, size of the library, and the discrepancy in the institutional robustness becomes abundantly clear.
Harvard is to Yale as a horse is to a cart. In the absence of the horse, the cart would still exist, it would just not travel very far from its position at the middle of the collegiate rankings. Moving Yale into higher prestige is the yearly tradition of The Game for which Yale students might pretend for one fleeting moment that they exert even an iota of superiority over Harvard. Such a scenario supposes, of course, the occasion of a Bulldog victory. Except an occasion such as this has rarely occurred of late. Long is the history between the two teams in which Harvard can claim not only the longest win streak of the rivalry, but victory in 10 of the last 12 meetings. Failure, it would seem, is endemic to this institution of “higher” learning.
Athletics is but one area of many where Yale can be found wanting.
Yale’s history of riding the coat-tails of its superior institution in Cambridge is nearly more prolific than the institution itself. Absent the work of Cotton Mather, a Harvard College graduate, Yale would’ve never secured the essential donation from the man for which it is named, Elihu Yale. Lest we forget, Yale, the man, achieved this great wealth which he so generously donated through his position as President of the East India Company, a position from which he was relieved due to corruption. Even it’s motto, Lux et Veritas (Light and Truth) is an unoriginal conception, attributable to Harvard’s, Veritas.
Greatness can hardly be believed to have even been a concern of Yale. Renown among commentators of the Ivy League is a certain unfortunate series of incidents in which a Yale student took to relieving himself in the laundry of fellow classmates. Appropriately dubbed the “poopetrator,” the student can’t be faulted, really. Defecation is just carrying out Yale’s reverence for being the number two of the Ivy League to its logical conclusion.
Defeat is inevitable for Yale this weekend. In its very formation, Yale is betrayed as second best and the product of Harvard minds. During this weekend’s contest, the Bulldogs, as is tradition, will again fall prey to Harvard mind and muscle.
It matters not. The Game is but a formality through which Yale may again regain relevancy, just in time for regular decision applications.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into its last weekend of the season, Harvard had some big things to keep in mind: finish the final stretch of the season on a high note and help send off the seniors in the best way possible. And while the Crimson (5-18, 3-11 Ivy) failed to secure victories against fellow Ivy League opponents Cornell (17-5, 10-3 Ivy) on Friday and Columbia (12-12, 3-9 Ivy) on Saturday, the team fought hard until the end in each game, leaving a silver lining for the season to come.
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 2
Harvard came into its Senior Day showdown against Columbia with a chip on its shoulder after falling to Columbia 3-0 on Oct. 11.
“There were a few key players on Columbia that we knew that we needed to slow down. We did a great job of practicing that throughout the week and executing at game time,” said Fields. “Going into the game, we were just focused on ending the season on a high note, fighting hard, and enjoying every minute of it.”
The Crimson dropped a hard-fought first set 27-25. However, the team came back strong in the second and third sets, taking them over the Lions 26-24 and 25-16, respectively. Mabry and senior Grace Roberts Burbank, who ended the night with 15 kills and a 0.389 hitting percentage, led the way on offense, while senior Sope Adeleye’s six blocks helped the stout Crimson defense.
“We have a saying, ‘E.T.T’ which means ‘Empty the Tank’. We say it during a long practice or a tough game. Emptying the tank means leaving everything that you have on the court for your teammates. It means pushing yourself harder than you think you can,” said Fields. “We just reminded each other that that game was the last chance we had this season to empty the tank. I was so proud of the whole team because we did just that.”
Despite the hole they dug themselves into, Columbia fought back hard against Harvard in the fourth set, taking it by a score of 25-20. It was a back-and-forth set for both teams, but Columbia eventually shut the door with seven straight points. In the final set of the season, Columbia again secured the set with a score of 16-14 to close out the match.
But even with a defeat in the final game of their careers, the Crimson seniors could sense a bright future ahead for the team.
“It felt very special for all four of us seniors. Given that it was our last Harvard volleyball game, I think all of our emotions were very high. But we just wanted to leave it all out on the court,” said Fields. “Even though it didn’t go our way in the end, I was so proud of how the whole team fought. It is still surreal to me that I’ve played my last game as part of the Crimson. I’m just grateful for all the memories and relationships that I’ve made. I’ve been so lucky to grow as a player and an individual in a program with great coaches and teammates, and I’m excited to watch the younger players continue to grow, too.”
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard started out with a bang, trading blows with Cornell in the first set until the score was tied at 13. At this point, the Crimson began to turn it up, rattling out a 4-1 scoring run on its way to forcing a Cornell timeout.
Senior Maclaine Fields cited the team’s preparation as a key to their successes in the game.
“We always have a specific game plan… our coaches spent a lot of time scouting [Cornell], and then we went over the key takeaways and watched film as a team,” said Fields. “We always have to be ready to adjust, because we never know exactly what the other team is going to show us.”
After Harvard’s initial hot streak in the first set, however, the Big Red began to take over. Answering with a scoring run of its own, Cornell fought its way to the first set, 25-23. In the second and third sets, Cornell continued to surmount a lead over the Crimson, taking the second by a score of 25-19 and securing the third and final set, 25-15.
Led by Fields’ four total blocks and junior Mindie Mabry’s eight kills on the night, the team still found some areas to improve in despite the loss.
“We always expect Ivy League matches to be close ones,” said Fields. “We know that we are going to have to fight for every point. We just embraced that and trusted our training. The tight games are always the most fun, anyway.”

1918 was a pretty big year for Harvard. The College took a stab at (ha!) creating a now-defunct bayonet fencing team, the Navy invaded Winthrop House, and – in a moment that has certainly made its mark in Crimson history – a member of the graduating class composed the infamous Ten Thousand Men of Harvard. For decades since, Ten Thousand Men has served as the university’s de facto fight song, even being named “among the best” college ballads (unfortunately, our friends across the river just beat Harvard out).
A century later, three of those ten thousand men have changed that.
You’ll be hard pressed to find any Harvard fans belting out lines about Old Eli and Harvard holding sway at The Game this weekend – but shout “We be in Adams!” in the vicinity of any Crimson-clad student and it’s a near-guarantee that you’ll be met with a resounding “that’s where all the action happens!”
Why? Last March’s Adams Housing Day video, a brainchild of junior running back and Adams House resident BJ Watson.
“The video was definitely spearheaded by BJ Watson, as most things are,” said defensive back and video co-creator Isaiah Wingfield. “Freshman year, we saw the Housing Day videos and knew that wherever we went, we would definitely do our best to make one. BJ led the way.”
Every year, the Thursday before undergraduates head home for spring break, Harvard hosts a tradition unique among its Ivy League competitors: Housing Day. That morning, as freshmen gather with their blocking groups – the other first-years with whom they’ve chosen to live – upperclassmen students storm their dorms, announcing which of Harvard’s twelve houses each block has been sorted into for the next three years.
However, before that adrenaline-fueled affair even begins comes the release of the Housing Day videos, with each upperclassmen dorm producing a music video to tout the perks of their own house and dispraise the other eleven. Each video is different – some are musical-esque, others are parodies – but Adams’ 2018 video stood apart from the rest both in its production and composure.
“We have a lot of talent in our group, so I was like you know what, we’re going to make a Housing Day video,” Watson said. “I figured that if we dropped something crazy, it might go down in history as one of the toughest ones to beat. And then the second we tried, we all sat down and came up with some good ideas.”
The group Watson is referring to: the large population of football players in Adams House. According to Wingfield, sixteen juniors and “a whole bunch” of seniors on the team call Adams House home, an outlier that junior running back Devin Darrington welcomes with open arms.
“It feels good seeing those guys out on the field and then seeing them when I go home to sleep,” Darrington said. “We really bond together; we're like a family. We come out here and ball together and then go home together and play Xbox.”
Though the video’s production was largely led by members of that football family, Watson and Co. made sure to include students from around the house. The video begins with a few members of the football team, along with a squad of other Adams students, dancing outside the house as Darrington drops his now-famous line: We be in Adams.
“We really tried to implement the diversity [of Adams] into the video,” Watson said. “We had John Jenkins' country rap in there, we had the girls rapping in there – we tried to mix it up, to implement different aspects of the house. That’s the thing I appreciate most [about Adams], going in there and seeing a bunch of different faces, but knowing that it’s all family.”
There’s nothing that encapsulates that sentiment more than the video’s final few lines. After a segment featuring the dining hall staff, Adams students are shown walking through the house in pairs, defensive end Justin Mitchell highlighting the house’s diversity with lines asking how many “athletes,” “geeks,” and “mathletes” Adams has. To each question, the crowd responds with a unanimous “a lot.”
“The best moment was probably Justin Mitchell, who did the last part of the video,” Wingfield said. “When he pulled up with Pepper the Dog, that was just classic.”
For the football players of Adams, the release of the Housing Day video was just the first quarter. Since March, the video has garnered almost 40,000 views, cementing its place as one of the most-viewed Harvard Housing Day videos of all time.
“When we dropped [the video] we were trying to get to five or ten thousand views, and we thought that would be great,” Wingfield said. “But then we looked it up five days later and we were at 14,000 views, and it just kept climbing.”
That climb is far from over. The Crimson ranked Adams’ video the best of the year, and according to its stars, there’s no escaping from the recognition that comes with being a YouTube sensation.
“People are still talking about it on campus,” Darrington said. “They'll see me and be like we be in Adams! It's a good feeling that people are watching our video.”
“I was at the half-marathon over the weekend and I had two people come up to me and say great Housing Day video,” Wingfield added. “It's still buzzing, which is pretty exciting.”
On the field, the men from Adams House are enjoying just as much success. Darrington currently leads the team in rushing yards and places second in points per game, with Watson shining both on the ground and in the air. On the defensive side, Wingfield is just as dominant, posting 32 tackles and 1.5 sacks over the course of the season. However, Darrington is quick to admit that he has not quite caught all projectiles thrown his way this year.
“During the filming [of the video], I got hit in the face with a snowball,” said Darrington. “They had to redo the footage because I couldn't open my eyes for a second – but other than that, the process was all smooth.”
Smooth may be an understatement – since the video’s release, both Darrington and Watson have reported numerous requests for a sequel. Thus, the question remains: will Adams House remain in the spotlight next year?
“I don’t know if we should just let the video marinate for a little bit, or go for a trilogy: three years in a row of fire videos,” said Watson. “You know that everyone’s going to come harder this year because we’ve set the bar – maybe we should just let other people have their fun and then come back two years from now and really shut them down. We’ll see.”
The trio certainly still has time to decide. With just over a year-and-a-half left in their Harvard careers, the players still have lots of opportunities to continue making their marks, whether that be on the field, in the classroom, or on film. No matter what they accomplish, pride will most definitely be abound in Adams House – after all, that’s where all the action happens.

“It is a mistake to try to look too far ahead. The chain of destiny can only be grasped one link at a time.” — Winston Churchill.
I write today as a humbled man. While last week’s Around the Ivies involved no real football analysis whatsoever, I called my picks simple, as the Ivy League matchups last weekend each had obvious choices in favor of the home teams. I was proved horribly, horribly, wrong, as the visiting squads each returned home victorious. Penn held off Harvard, Yale upset Princeton, and Cornell shocked Dartmouth in what would have been the largest surprise of the year had Brown not actually won a game last weekend. I return to you sporting an 0-4 record from the weekend prior, licking my wounds and my tail between my legs. Clearly, I did not follow Churchill’s advice, and I toyed with forces I did not understand. The football gods may not be kind, but they are just and fair. I, a mere mortal, have been punished for my hubris.
But this week is not for dwelling on the past. It’s Harvard-Yale week. The Game. The supernatural forces of football dare not get involved in tradition. The Yale Bowl will be packed to the gills, and for good reason: Yale will be playing for a share of the Ivy League title. This fact, however, means little to the other side. Even if both teams were 0-9 entering the contest, nothing matters more than the final game of the season. There is only one way for the season to end, and this weekend in New Haven, the past does not matter. Only the outcome of The Game. Following last week, I’ll just operate by the same rules.
DARTMOUTH VS. BROWN
If you had asked me last week, I would have written a single sentence for this paragraph, expressing my exhaustion with having beaten down Brown in these articles week after week. I would have even offered condolences to the Bears, to have such a long season be concluded at the hands of the Ancient Eight’s most dominating foe en route to an undefeated Big Green season. But like I said, this weekend is The Game. No time for the past.
Brown won a football game. I cannot believe I am typing these words. Nothing is predictable anymore. At this point, the chaos and parity of the Ivy League is not to be trifled with. In one way, my previous argument that Ancient Eight parity is very back proved true, and doomed my picks the next day. I owe Brown credit for the previous week, especially following my relentless bombardment so far this season. But even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in awhile.
Dartmouth by 21.
PRINCETON VS. PENN
I’m tempted to go against the favorite here. Despite last week’s bloodbath, I would likely just pick Princeton and be done with it. But then I saw something extraordinary last week in the press conference following the Harvard-Penn game. Senior defensive lineman Prince Emili of the Quakers strolled into the media room with other players and his head coach, where he clearly gave some of the best answers we have gotten to questions all season. It was not what he said, however, that is swaying my opinion of this weekend’s game; it’s what he wore. The veteran donned a huge wrestling belt that he claimed belonged to the linebacking core but was gracefully bestowed upon him following the victory, a gift which he honorably accepted. Princeton is still good. But the belt has impressed me enough to shave some points off of my prediction.
Princeton by 7.
COLUMBIA VS. CORNELL
Last weekend, Cornell felt right at home travelling from the middle of nowhere Ithaca and arriving in the middle of nowhere Hanover, taking down an undefeated Dartmouth and turning the entire Ivy League on its head. Despite my previous points, I am still a history major, and I feel I must take lessons from the past. Cornell turned the conference upside down in an upset similar to the American colonists over Great Britain way back in the Revolution. The city-slickers at Columbia, formerly known as King’s College, might as well be traversing the Atlantic Ocean as they trek into the wilderness of upstate New York. I’ll trust the Big Red, the Lions will be too far from home and civilization this weekend. Plus, Columbia just lost to Brown. Pretty sure that was supposed to be impossible.
Cornell by 3.
HARVARD VS. YALE
Here we are folks. The Game. I know that it’s the early game this weekend, but this entry is coming last as it should, just like The Game itself. There is something poetic to ending the season the exact same way every single year. It truly does not matter what happened the week before, or even the nine weeks before. All of your energy goes into defeating a hated rival, no matter the stakes. There are no other opponents, no playoffs, no nothing. This is it.
This year, Yale is playing for a share at the Ancient Eight title. Again, the chaos of the Ivy League has inspired me to completely contradict myself, as I will take another look at history. Take 2016, for example. Harvard was looking to take home its fourth-straight conference title with a win at home against Yale. All the 7-2 Crimson had to do was dispose of the 2-7 Bulldogs. Yale, playing with absolutely nothing to lose, came out of the half with a surprise onside kick that reminded me of Sean Payton’s Saints in Super Bowl XLIV (also known as the saddest event in sports history) and shocked Harvard to steal an Ivy League crown out from under the Crimson’s noses.
And that’s the beauty of The Game. Harvard has not won a conference title since. Yale was projected to win this season, and after a rocky start has been saved by Cornell to get a shot during its last week. Following a beatdown of Princeton that the Tigers hadn’t seen in years and with Harvard in the middle of a four-game losing skid, the Bulldogs look like the overwhelming favorite to take home a share of the crown once again. But, as I learned last week, nothing whatsoever makes sense in this league anymore. So maybe my picks shouldn’t either.

“He’s just such a classy individual.”
These were the very first words out of the mouth of Dartmouth coach Buddy Teeevens when describing fellow head coach Tim Murphy following a matchup between the two peers. While an outsider could seemingly trust the opinions of another coach who has also headed an Ivy League team for over 20 seasons, the pair of coaches have actually known each other since the seventh grade, with parallel careers through the Ivy League.
“He’s a close friend, but we’re competitors on gameday,” Teevens added. “We’ll say hello before and goodbye after, and we’ll get together on Thanksgiving and commiserate a little bit.”
This competitiveness is no new development.
“Buddy and I are very close,” Murphy explained. “We’ve known each other since seventh grade, when we met in junior high school. We were both very competitive guys.”
It is this very nature as a competitor that has led Murphy to where he is now: one victory shy of the record for most wins ever by an Ivy League football coach.
While I have interviewed him on many occasions as a reporter, I first met Harvard football coach Tim Murphy in the late spring of 2017. I was 18 years old, just a high school student living in Louisville, Kentucky. I had just recently been accepted to Harvard College, and was warmly invited to an alumni reception at a fancy country club. A surprise guest, Tim Murphy announced to the group that he was on a recruiting trip near his old stomping grounds in Cincinnati, Ohio, and had heard that there was an admitted students event just 90 minutes away. He shared that he could not possibly pass up the opportunity to meet Harvard’s newest members, and greeted new students with intense enthusiasm. Murphy headlined the event with an articulate speech about passion, initiative, and success.
Success is definitely one of the first things to come to mind when Murphy’s name is invoked. In addition to the approaching record, the longtime Harvard coach has captured nine conference titles and his Harvard teams have the best winning percentage in the FCS since the turn of the millenium, among these three undefeated campaigns.
Murphy, however, has never been only a football coach. The Crimson’s commander has led teams to victory on the gridiron, but he has also shaped many lives of young men. Sending nearly two dozen players to national-level academic recognition, Murphy always understood his all-important role not only as a coach, but also as a mentor and supporter to many that have cycled through Harvard.
While it seems that Murphy is Harvard football at its core, he has not been in Cambridge forever. Even so, the path for the next winningest coach in Ivy League history started in the Ancient Eight forty years ago. Following four years as a linebacker at Springfield College, Murphy’s first coaching job came as a part-time assistant at Brown.
“My first job out of college was as a 22-year old graduate assistant at Brown,” Murphy said. “I was in the Ivy League and I was really impressed by the kids, and how they could truly be real Division I athletes. They were high-character kids and high-character academic kids.”
Eventually, Murphy would team up with his childhood friend Teevens once again, serving as the offensive coordinator for Maine. At this point in time, however, his coaching future was far from guaranteed.
“I was actually getting out of coaching, and not because I didn’t love it,” Murphy recalled. “I was the offensive coordinator, and I had actually gotten into a couple of quality MBA programs at the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern and Darden at the University of Virginia, so I had actually tendered my resignation as the offensive coordinator.”
When opportunity came knocking, however, Murphy answered the door.
“Out of the blue, the head coach left and they offered me the job, and I was like, ‘wow, this is exactly what I always wanted, I just did not know if I would have the opportunity,’” he said. “We were very fortunate our first year.”
Murphy would succeed his friend Teevens in the head coaching position. The ever-driven Murphy was only 30 years old, the youngest head coach in the country at the time. New on the scene, the young gun helmed the Black Bears to a conference title and their first-ever Division I-AA tournament berth in school history, leading to his next job with the University of Cincinnati.
Not much had changed before his next job. As of 1989, Murphy was still the youngest head coach in the nation at 32 years old, and the team he inherited faced even more adversity than Maine.
“That was a really challenging job,” Murphy explained. “I inherited a job that was going to be on three years of probation.”
With a condemned stadium, 19 lost scholarships due to previous coaches’ infractions, and no practice facilities whatsoever, Tim Murphy took the reins of a doomed program in the Cincinnati Bearcats.
No stranger to adversity, Murphy faced an uphill climb in reversing his team’s fortune. In his final season with Cincinnati, Murphy finally turned around the Bearcats with an 8-3 record, its first winning mark in 11 years.
“We went from 1-10 in 1990 to 8-3 in 1993,” Murphy said. “All of a sudden, a bunch of potential opportunities popped up.”
After conquering yet another mountain of intense odds, Murphy turned his sights toward Harvard.
“I told my wife, ‘I really think I want this Harvard job,’” Murphy said. “I was the first and only one in my family to go to college. I thought it would be great for our children to grow up in an environment that really made people understand that education is important and that education is powerful.”
His first inclination proved correct.
“Like anything else in life, you go with your gut,” Murphy said. “And it’s the best decision I’ve ever made.”
Now, 26 seasons and 178 wins later, the Crimson’s leader finds himself at the brink of history, yet it is the last thing on his mind.
At my admitted students event nearly 1,000 miles from Harvard Stadium, Tim Murphy made sure to walk around to every table and shake hands with students all over the banquet room. It became clear very quickly to everyone in the room that Murphy serves as much more to the Harvard community than the coach of the football team. While he sits at the edge of reaching an impressive record, anyone who has met the coach knows that Tim Murphy has meant much more than a set of statistics to Harvard over the past 26 years, and he will continue to do so well after any records are broken.

“We joke around, we have a lot of fun with each other, we hang out with each other outside of football. So I feel like that's the type of stuff that I'm definitely gonna remember the most.”
Hailing from Stephens City, Va., senior defensive lineman Brogan McPartland has had the opportunity to reflect on his football career at Harvard in advance of the annual Harvard-Yale matchup. The scoring sheets display McPartland’s many tackles and quarterback hurries across his four years on the team — but they do not show the lifelong friendships McPartland has made through football, an aspect of the sport that he cherishes the most.
“It’s the camaraderie with your teammates [and] going through the same thing as them,” McPartland said. “Not a lot of other people on campus or in general are going through the same things we're going through and just being able to relate to each other be able to rely on each other... it's probably one of my favorite parts [about football].”
Just like he emphasizes the friendships he forms through football, McPartland also places importance on the mental aspect of the game. On the cutthroat and rigorously challenging football team, McPartland has maintained an easygoing attitude. He credits his ability to stay loose during practices and games as a crucial factor for success on the squad.
“One thing I really try to avoid, especially when it comes to this part of the year is trying to stress too much or think too much about it,” McPartland said. “I'm just trying to come up with some focus on practice, focusing on [our opponent’s] schemes, things like [what] to expect, but overall, outside of here, I'm trying not to think too much about it [and] just go out there.”
McPartland’s calm and collected attitude towards football has had a tremendous impact on the rest of the football team. During his time on the squad, McPartland has led by quiet yet stellar example, according to Head Coach Tim Murphy.
“Yeah, Brogan's not one of those guys to, you know, get some up on the bully pulpit,” Murphy said. “He's a relatively quiet guy. But his competitiveness, his work ethic, and ultimately his high level of plays [as] a huge motivator. I think for the younger players, it's given our defensive team a tremendous amount of output in energy.”
This weekend will mark McPartland’s final game at Harvard — but it is also the final game of his football career, one that began long before his time with the Harvard football team. Football was a fixture in McPartland’s life as he grew up, and he faces his imminent retirement with both nostalgia and excitement.
“I've been playing football since I was [10] years old. I mean, this has been something I've been doing my entire life,” McPartland said. “Somebody going on 12 years now of doing this realizing that, you know, in a couple of days it's going to be over... it's a weird feeling. It's exciting in a way, a new chapter in my life. It's something of course I'm gonna miss — you don't do something for 12 years unless you're really, really passionate about it.”
In his final chapter, McPartland looks to lead Harvard football to a victory in its annual tilt against Yale. Harvard has split its last two matchups against Yale, falling 24-3 in 2017 but rebounding with a 45-27 trouncing last year. This year, the match will take place on Yale’s home turf on Saturday at noon. In his final game on the squad and perhaps Harvard’s biggest matchup of the season, McPartland will look to leave his mark on a team that has given him so much over the last four years.
“[Playing at Yale is] going to feel nostalgic, especially because I haven't played there [since] two years ago,” McPartland said. “Being a senior knowing this is my last game right now, and the season hasn't exactly gone the way we expected, [we] aren't exactly in the position we'd like to be at this point. [But it] hasn't changed the fact that [it’s] a huge game. It's our biggest game of the season. Overall, I think as a team, we're just really pumped up to get this opportunity, especially going back there after we [lost] two years ago.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s and women’s swimming and diving each bounced back from losses in their opening meet to defeat Dartmouth and Cornell this past Saturday on Dartmouth’s campus in Hanover, N.H.
A week after opening its season with two losses to Duke and No. 7 Texas A&M, Harvard men’s swimming (2-2, 2-0 Ivy) topped the two Ivy League opponents in a performance that showed why the Crimson is the three-time defending Ivy League champion. Harvard barely broke a sweat on its way to a 185-113 victory over the Big Red (2-1, 1-1 Ivy) and a 193-105 takedown of the Big Green (0-4, 0-2 Ivy), thanks in large part to a trio of record-setting performances.
First to rewrite the record books was Harvard’s 200 yard medley relay team of first-year Will Grant, captain Daniel Chang, sophomore Umitcan Gures, and junior Mahlon Reihman, who touched the wall over 2 seconds ahead of the nearest opponent, tying the pool record of 1:30.47 set by another Harvard relay squad in 2016.
Grant and Gures then did some record breaking on their own. Grant gapped the field by almost 3 seconds in the 200 backstroke, posting a new venue record at 1:46.48. Gures broke the facility record en route to his victory in the 100 fly, stopping the clock at 48.17 and removing one record from the long list belonging to Harvard senior Dean Farris.
Harvard captured victories in nine of the fourteen swimming events on the day. Freshman Marcus Holmquist won the 200 freestyle, Grant picked up another first in the 100 back, as did Chang in the 100 breast. Jared Simpson won the 200 breast, first-year Cole Kuster took the top spot in the 500 freestyle, and the Crimson finished the meet with a victory in the 400 free relay with a team of Kuster, Gures, Reihman, and sophomore Ryan Linnihan.
The meet was a dominant and promising return to the winning column for the Crimson. After finishing eighth in the country last March at the NCAA championships, Harvard knew this season would come with adjustments due to the loss of key seniors and the season-long absence of Farris: Harvard’s American record-holder and national champion who decided to take a year off to train for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. But Harvard, who has become somewhat of a national powerhouse in recent years, may have found a new star in Grant, who helped set a World Junior Record in the mixed 4x100 medley relay this summer and was named to the US Junior National Team in September.
On the women’s side, a week after falling to No. 17 Duke, Harvard (2-1, 2-0 Ivy) dominated Dartmouth and Cornell, winning by scores of 191-101 and 201-94, respectively.
The women also broke three pool records on the day. The first came in the 200 medley relay, in which the quartet of first-year Adaline Rose Bullock, senior Mei Lynn Colby, junior Kennidy Quist, and first-year Felicia Pasadyn finished in 1:43.13.
Pasadyn followed up her anchor leg by shattering the venue record in the 200 butterfly with a 2:00.10, over a second faster than the previous best time and over two seconds faster than the 2nd-place finisher.
The defending Ivy League champion wrapped up the meet with its final record in the 400 free relay. Pasadyn once again was a part of it, taking the team out hard in the first leg before senior Miki Dahlke, Colby, and sophomore Samantha Shelton brought it home for a 3:24.71.
The women secured 8 additional victories in the meet. Quist won the 200 freestyle in 1:50.23, the 50 free in 23.61, and the 200 breast in 2:20.07. Colby took the 100 back and the 100 free in times of 55.90 and 51.59, Shelton ran away with the 200 back, winning by almost four seconds, and Dahlke secured the 100 fly. Junior diver Georgina Milne won the 1-meter diving event, hitting the NCAA qualifying standard in the process.
The Crimson next hit the water on Friday at Columbia, where it looks to preserve its unbeaten record in the Ivies.

The Game. Devoid of qualification and teeming with history, there can be little said or done to add to the magnificence of the contest. In this, the nation’s second-oldest football rivalry, history far outweighs anything that will transpire inside the historic Yale Bowl this weekend.
“[The history of] it certainly adds to the environment of The Game, the appeal of The Game, and the rivalry,” coach Tim Murphy said. “What I tell our team, what I believe is, any rivalry game, whether you’re undefeated going in, or — in our case — struggling for some vindication, it’s all about pride.”
In this, the 136th contest between the institutions, Harvard (4-5, 2-4 Ivy) will be adopting the role of spoiler. Precluded from an Ancient Eight crown, the best the Crimson can do is finish fourth. Yale (8-1, 5-1), however, has been slingshotted to the top of the division following a string of fortunate upsets to division rivals last weekend.
The Game, then, features a bit of drama. If the Bulldogs win, it will at worst share the Ivy League title with No. 21/22 Dartmouth. If it loses, Dartmouth would also need to also drop its contest to Brown this weekend — a near impossibility — to catalyze a three-way tie at the top of the division.
“Whether that’s Alabama-Auburn, Michigan-Ohio State, Harvard-Yale, it’s all about pride,” Murphy said. “Pride in your program, pride in your team, pride in your school, that’s what it’s about for our alumni and for our students. It’s about pride.”
But momentum is high in New Haven. Last week, the squad cemented itself in the Ivy League title conversation and earned a national ranking by thrashing No. 18/19 Princeton, 51-14. It had been 142 contests since Yale had won by as much.
Prior to the contest, many thought Princeton to be the clear second-place squad, having lost only to Dartmouth the week prior in Yankee Stadium, in what many believed to be the Ivy League title game. Defeating the only other unbeaten in the division, Dartmouth needed only cruise over two of the division’s weakest teams in Cornell and Brown to claim sole possession of the top spot in the Ivy League.
Then Cornell beat Dartmouth.
The Crimson, while sporting five losses in its 2019 campaign, has not once lost by more than one score. In its four-game skid, the team’s deficits total to 20 total points.
“Honestly, we felt like we should’ve won the last four games we’ve lost,” said captain and defensive back Wes Ogsbury. “A couple of bad bounces, but we can’t dwell on it. Obviously, we have another opponent every week, and this week is Yale, a really good team. We approach this week with a new mindset.”
Since the team’s 32-point loss to Dartmouth at the beginning of the season, the Bulldogs have been playing exceptionally well. Two close contests with Richmond and Penn were buffered by three subsequent routs of Columbia, Brown, and Princeton. Harvard dropped contests to two of these three teams.
“It’s the best Yale team I’ve seen in a long, long time,” Murphy said. “They are clearly playing the best football — offense, defense, special teams — of any team in our league at this point in this season.”
At the helm of the Bulldogs’ explosive offense is senior quarterback Kurt Rawlings. The veteran, who didn’t play in The Game last season due to a season-ending injury suffered against Penn, has returned to play with a vengeance. Rawlings throws with a 62 percent accuracy, accumulating 2585 yards and 24 touchdowns to his name. Yale’s play caller leads the division in passing efficiency, touchdowns, yardage, and average yards per game.
He’ll be throwing against a Crimson defense that has allowed 236.6 pass yards per game, about 50 yards below Rawlings’ average. That defense hosts junior defensive back Max Jones who shares the Ancient Eight lead for interceptions this season with three.
“They have arguably a potential player of the year in [Rawlings],” Murphy said. “He’s been a great leader, he’s a dual threat guy, and he certainly fuels their offense.”
The Crimson’s defense has been as impressive as the Bulldogs’ offense this season. The group boasts the fewest allowed rushing yards in the division, and tops the Ancient Eight in third and first-down performance. Senior safety Cole Thompson leads the group in tackles while senior defensive lineman Brogan McPartland leads the league in sacks with 7.5. Harvard overall leads the nation in sacks. In special teams, the team paces the nation in blocked kicks and blocked punts.
Attempting to gain a foothold against the imposing Havard defensive line will be Zane Dudek. Like Rawlings, Dudek is very familiar with the Crimson. While Rawlings started against Harvard even in 2016, Dudek’s introduction to the Crimson came one year later. The back has played Harvard twice before, leading Yale in rushing yards both previous contests.
Also to watch on the Bulldogs’ offensive front is JP Shohfi and Reed Klubnik. The two are first and second in the Ivy League for yards, respectively. Shohfi, who serves as the sole captain of the squad, boasts 909 yards and Klubnik has 861. For reference, the Crimson’s leading receiver, senior Cody Chrest, is seventh in the division with 600 yards through the air.
This season’s rendition of The Game will take place in the Yale Bowl. With a capacity officially listed as 61,446, the arena holds over double the people that can fit in the Harvard Stadium. Exempting last year alone, The Game has alternated between the two historic Stadiums every year since 1894.
Previously unique to the Yale Bowl was its utilization of grass over the typical synthetic turf on the surface of play. It was only this year that the stadium tore out the dying grass and made the long overdue installation.
“I think everybody in the league is happy for it,” Murphy said. “The last time we played on their grass field it was just a mudder, a slog. Just cosmetically, it looks better.”
The Bulldogs enter the contest with the better record, with a healthy slew of players, and title implications on the line. The Crimson enters with only pride at stake.
“The team is very excited, I’m very excited,” Ogsbury said. “It’s my last game in a Harvard uniform so I’m going to give it all I’ve got. I know my brothers around me are going to give it all they’ve got. It’s not for a championship but we’re going to treat it like a championship game. We’re going to hopefully ruin Yale’s season and do it for the Harvard football name, tradition, the city of Cambridge, and everything else.”

In the middle of last year’s back-and-forth Yale-Harvard contest, The Game halted for what seemed like hours, forcing spectators to debate the age-old question: Is Harvard spiteful or merely pompous?
In other words: Was it the middle finger or the index finger?
Yale fans may be forgiven for having buried the memory of this pitiful pedantry. The controversial moment came in the fourth quarter, with Harvard clinging to a one-point lead over an injury-riddled Eli squad. Running back Devin Darrington burst through a hole with a clear path to the end zone. He then turned around toward Yale’s pursuing defender and stuck a phalange in his face. After a long replay review, the referees docked Darrington with an unsportsmanlike penalty and negated his touchdown. The paper for which I write scrambled to dig up proof that Darrington merely extended his index finger — that his grandstanding merited a PG rating as opposed to PG-13.
We should have expected nothing more of our crimson-faced counterparts. Never quite fulfilled, longing for external validation, they always have to turn around to comfort themselves that someone is a bit worse off than they are, and they make sure they know it. A club is not a club if no one is excluded from it. Their fragile egos require flaunting.
It’s why the Crimson’s columnists like to make themselves feel better by disparaging our college and city in their annual Yale-Harvard rejoinders. Perhaps they’re insecure that Harvard’s greatest “win” was just a tie, and it happened 51 years ago. (The Elis hold the overall edge with 67 wins to Harvard’s 60). Yalies, meanwhile, care much more about who’s next to us than who’s behind us.
So let’s focus on Yalies. The Game promises to punctuate a dominant fall season for Bulldog athletes. The men’s soccer team shredded its Ivy League opponents en route to a conference title and now awaits the NCAA Tournament, boasting a No. 25 national ranking. Four players earned spots on the All-Ivy First Team, a school record; one of them, Mark Winhoffer ’21, ranks fifth in the nation in assists.
The women’s volleyball team, meanwhile, pulled off an epic five-set win over Princeton last Saturday to clinch a share of the Ivy League throne — its third straight title. Neither team lost a game at home this season.
The Bulldogs who will charge into the Yale Bowl on Saturday have not lost in New Haven, either, and they enter on a torrid streak. The Elis toppled their last four Ivy League opponents with 46, 45, 59 and 51 points, respectively, although to opposing defenses, “disrespect” seems more apt.
The offense is a multi-headed behemoth. At the helm is Kurt Rawlings ’20, who Harvard fans may remember as the upstart rookie who silenced cocky Crimson fans in his first season in 2016, leading Yale to an upset victory in Cambridge. Harvard fans may also remember Rawlings from his poised passing performance in 2017, when Yale reeled off 24 straight points against a tepid Crimson squad to polish off an Ivy League championship season.
After missing last season’s Game due to injury, Rawlings has returned to his old ways, setting Yale’s all-time passing records in yardage and touchdowns this season. A legitimate two-way threat, Rawlings also leads the team with seven rushing scores this season, racking up 252 net yards on the ground.
Wide receivers Reed Klubnik ’20 and JP Shohfi ’20, the captain, present opposing secondaries with an impossible challenge, combining for more than 200 yards per game. And the backfield duo of Zane Dudek ’21 and Alan Lamar ’20 provides head coach Tony Reno with a genuinely balanced offensive package. This Yale team has no shortage of confidence as it seeks to add a third Ivy League title to this season’s haul.
It represents, moreover, what The Game is all about for Yalies. Our accomplished squad exemplifies, however trite it sounds, the power of coming together and channeling our passions for common purposes. The meaning of The Game transcends the game. As students, faculty, alumni and the New Haven community gather on Saturday, we will fill the capacious Yale Bowl with a spirit of warmth, revelry and shared connection. The Game is more than anything else an occasion to celebrate the relationships we value most. It is one of the constants in a Yale student’s college experience around which so many memories revolve.
We don’t particularly care what extremities our competitors shove in our faces. We don’t particularly care about our competitors at all. As we huddle together in the stands and on the sidelines, overcoming the November cold with our collective energy, we have no reason to look behind us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
TROY, N.Y. — The No. 10/8 Harvard men’s hockey team took a rare one-night road trip to face RPI on Friday night in search of another two points to keep its season-long winning streak alive. The Engineers’ sub-.500 record belied their decent offensive efforts so far this season; for its part, the Crimson had yet to face a team that found a way to capitalize on its mistakes.
Friday’s contest proved to be the closest one Harvard (6-0-0, 6-0 ECAC) has fought in so far this year, as RPI’s (4-6-1, 2-4-1) own timely goal-scoring punished the Crimson’s missteps. Nevertheless, a shutdown goaltending show in relief from senior Cameron Gornet and a hat trick from sophomore forward Casey Dornbach put the visitors past the Engineers by a score of 6-3.
“[We’re] happy to get the win in a...tough place to play on the road,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought it was a very tightly-contested game all the way into the third.”
Harvard’s high-energy start featured a goal in the first minute of play, as junior defenseman Reilly Walsh fired a shot from the left point that was tipped in front by junior forward Henry Bowlby. The tally extends Bowlby’s point streak to five games. Soon after, Dornbach turned on the jets for an unsuccessful breakaway attempt, which earned him a penalty shot.
Dornbach made no mistake, shooting right past RPI sophomore net-minder Owen Savory — the program’s first penalty shot goal since one scored by Dominic Moore ’03 back in 2002. The Crimson was now leading by two goals before the halfway mark of the first period.
But the Engineers had more to give. The first response came from rookie blue-liner Cory Babichuk, whose point shot trickled through Harvard freshman goaltender Mitchell Gibson for his first career goal. The Crimson had led in shots for the first few minutes of the period; now RPI found its momentum.
It wasn’t long before the hosts were rewarded once again. A giveaway by the wall in Harvard’s zone saw the puck make its way to senior forward Chase Zieky, unwatched, near the blue paint. Gibson had no chance on Zieky’s shot, and just like that, the game was tied.
“I thought we came out of the gates early and were really skating and making plays and were up 2-0,” coach Donato said. “And we had several chances — good chances — to make it 3-0, but RPI really battled and got back to 2-2.”
The rest of the period seemed as though it would proceed with the teams knotted, 2-2. The Crimson had its first man-advantage chance but was unable to make much of it. With less than two minutes to go, however, an unlikely backhand attempt from sophomore forward Baker Shore — as Shore was in the low slot, watched by three Engineer skaters — beat Savory. Once again, the visitors had retaken the lead.
The second period began with more RPI pressure; Gibson, who has been excellent in his young collegiate career, was forced to make several strong saves to preserve Harvard’s lead. But one of those in-close stops seemed to cause the net-minder some discomfort. Gibson stayed down for a few minutes before skating off with assistance. Though Gibson would later return to the bench in his equipment, senior Cameron Gornet took his place between the pipes for the rest of the night.
“It looked like [Gibson] tweaked something,” coach Donato said. “I don’t think it’s of the major variety, but…agility and flexibility is such a key factor. He wasn’t able to play at the same level and we were able to get him out of there. We’ll get him back to Harvard and hopefully we can reevaluate.”
More misfortune lay in store for the Crimson. On the rush, Engineers sophomore forward Ture Linden took a shot from the right circle, looking for senior linemate Todd Burgess by the side of the net. Gornet’s sliding save kept out Linden’s initial shot, but Burgess’s attempt skipped over the sprawled net-minder and into the net, evening the score once more.
A flurry of whistles marked the latter half of the middle frame. Neither Harvard nor RPI scored on its first powerplay chances of the period, the Engineers benefiting from 37 seconds of 5-on-3 time as well.
Soon after killing off the 5-on-3, though, the Crimson found itself on the man-advantage; a clean tic-tac-toe play from Walsh to sophomore forward Jack Drury found Dornbach at the front of the net, where he cashed in for his second tally of the evening. Once again, the Crimson left the ice ahead by a goal.
Though the scoreboard was close, the shot count was not. By the start of the third, the Engineers were outshooting Harvard nearly two to one. But the hosts had also never come back from a third-period deficit this season. Gornet looked primed to continue his sharp net-minding.
“I thought [Gornet] was very solid,” coach Donato said. “It’s not an easy situation to go into tight games...where you’re outshot quite a bit…. I thought he made the saves that we needed to be able to continue playing with the lead.”
As the Crimson turned up the heat in the offensive zone, winning a puck battle at the near wall, Drury found Dornbach all alone in front of the net. The sophomore put the biscuit in the basket for the third time, earning his first career hat trick.
“I’m fortunate to play with two great players in Nick [Abruzzese] and Jack [Drury],” said Dornbach when asked about his line’s play this season. “We just like having fun. We’re lucky that we have had some early success, but we can keep getting better, and there’s still a long way to go.”
Harvard, holding onto its first two-goal lead since the very start of the game, had the last word, as senior forward Frederic Gregoire stole the puck in the RPI zone for a neat backhander, his first of the season. The 6-3 result marks the fourth time this season the Crimson has put six or more goals on its opponents.
The squad leads the country in goals per game (5.50), has outscored foes 33-10, and along with No. 2 Cornell, is one of the nation’s only remaining unbeaten teams. Harvard’s offensive chemistry is undeniable.
“There’s depth up front,” coach Donato said. “We have four lines that feel like they can contribute offensively…. That depth definitely gives us some confidence. We know as the season goes on that it’s going to be tougher and tougher to score, but for us it’s about the process.”
Still, though, the Crimson has errors to clean up on defense. Both its goalies have save percentages that rank in the NCAA’s top five, but Gibson (4 GP, 1.49 GAA, .955 SV%) and Gornet (3 GP, 1.90 GAA, .955 SV%) can’t necessarily bail out their teammates every weekend.
“Hopefully we’ll adjust to this as the season goes on, but we’re not a team that just throws a lot of pucks at the net,” coach Donato said. “It seems to be something that’s working at this point, but defensively we’d like to make sure that we are establishing a little more offensive zone time so that we don’t have to give up as many shots as we have been giving up.”
The biggest tests in that respect are forthcoming in the next two weeks. The Friday after Thanksgiving, Harvard faces its first out-of-conference opponent, No. 14/12 Boston College, a group currently on its own five-game win streak. Then the Crimson plays host to longtime rival Cornell in a clash of the ECAC leaders. Whether or not Harvard can keep up its tear remains to be seen.
