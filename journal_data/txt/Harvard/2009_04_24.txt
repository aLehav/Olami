After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Elks Lodge in Central Square, with its cheap paneled walls, dinged-up wood floor, and grey concrete basement, looks like a mausoleum for the 1970s. But it was full of life three weeks ago, when a group of about 60 people—with plenty of tattoos, scruffy facial hair, and bobbed haircuts between them—milled about in easy, friendly chatter.
Closed just a few years ago after some particularly rowdy hardcore punk shows, the Elks Lodge was open again on this night for a different assortment of DIY (do-it-yourself) music, including the frenzied punk rock of Foreign Objects and Libyans—whose singers pinballed back and forth among the assembled audience—and the heavy sludge of California’s In Disgust, who set the entire building vibrating and part of the crowd slam dancing.
Between sets, Catherine P. Humphreville ’10, the rock director of Harvard’s WHRB, flitted from person to person, distributing flyers for the station’s Record Hospital Fest and urging each one to come to Harvard. It’s a trip that many of them have made before.
“Boston is kind of unapologetically hardcore,” says John Bogan of the band Daniel Striped Tiger. And though Boston hardcore is sometimes associated with violence and insularity, there is also a more diverse and welcoming community of DIY punk, hardcore, and post-hardcore bands like Bogan’s that has long been open to a small group of Harvard students like Humphreville. These punk rockers, despite occupying a peripheral position on campus, have been central players in the scene.
TUNING IN TO BOSTON

“I feel like I would describe my college experience more as a resident of Boston and Cambridge who goes to school at Harvard than as a Harvard student who goes to Boston,” says Christa M. Hartsock ’10, the president of WHRB and host of “Dischord and Dynne,” a Friday night radio show that features live performances by local DIY bands and provides a free recording for them. Since the inception of Record Hospital—WHRB’s underground rock department—many of its other DJs have felt the same.
RH began in the late 70s as Plastic Passions, playing a mix of music that included reggae and new wave, though its focus soon shifted to indie rock. In the early 90s, as bands like Nirvana and record labels like Matador garnered mainstream attention for college rock, RH, which had been loosely linked to the local Boston scene in the past, began to emphasize it.
“We kind of reacted against that, that the music had gotten too commercial and lost its punk roots,” says Peter F. Rojas ’97, now an internet entrepreneur who helped create both Engadget and the independent-minded RCRD LBL. “We were more interested in bands that weren’t trying to cross over from college rock to MTV.”
Along with New Yorker staff writer Kelefa T. Sanneh ’97, Rojas self-consciously pulled RH in a DIY direction. “We wouldn’t play anything from a major label,” he says. “We wouldn’t play anything with a barcode with it.”
But that dedication to local punk music—most of Rojas’s friends, he says, came from Boston, not Harvard—had begun to fade by the time Zachary I. Baron ’04-’05 arrived at RH, which he says was then in “a wussier phase.” “It was kind of a nerdy, stand-offish, hostile group that kind of looked down at other people,” says Baron, now an editor at the Village Voice. For him, that group represented “a real low in terms of the station’s interface with the greater community.”
With people like Rojas and Sanneh in mind, Baron organized the first Record Hospital Fest in 2002 in part to create a greater connection with the Boston scene. (He also hoped to give RH a bigger name and “just wanted to see these bands play.”) Though Baron held the first RH Fest at Tufts, the Harvard campus has hosted it—and several other shows—since then. Thanks to Baron, influential Boston screamo band Orchid played their final show at The Harvard Advocate. So many people showed up that the band ended up playing two separate sets to two separate audiences. 
Today, venues like The Advocate and The Democracy Center at 45 Mt. Auburn remain key sites for shows. But keeping Harvard involved in the scene has required a constant stream of new, enthusiastic students, which RH has been able to provide.
“It’s just exciting to see a scene that’s small, that can feel somewhat isolated from other students here, can continue finding other people who support it, who seek out that sense of community, build the community with each other and bands, and keep the community alive,” longtime DJ Grant M. Damon ’09 says of RH. 
The RH comp plays a large role in nurturing and maintaining Harvard’s small group of DIY devotees. Largely based around punk and hardcore music, the intensive comp process involves weekly lectures about different genres as well as a weekly listening assignment of about 10 albums. “You learn about this from a very historical perspective,” former RH director Baris C. Ercal ’10 says. “It’s all contextualized. Everything is just put together in a way that’s very interesting, and I feel like, in particular, academically-oriented Harvard students would like that.”
Though students like Damon and Ercal got involved in local scenes in high school, many RH compers arrive with a more general interest in indie rock and punk. For them, the comp process is an invaluable learning tool. “If you don’t really have a context for it, you might find it abrasive or you might not understand where it’s coming from, why it might be important in the genre,” Humphreville says. “But I think the way the comp process works, you build up to that.”
“For me, it’s really rewarding to see someone come in liking [indie pop band] the Unicorns and start liking really brutal hardcore,” Hartsock says.
DO-IT-YOURSELF, TOGETHER

RH’s focus on and involvement with local bands is due in large part to the importance of community in the DIY scene, which RH attempts to foster and preserve. “We try to pay special attention to the local scene, both in what we play on air and in putting together RH Fest, just because what constitutes a DIY community is so much based on local scenes,” Humphreville says.
“It’s really neat that you have this really old Ivy League school, and they’re more active [in the scene] than any other university in Boston,” Daniel Striped Tiger’s Bogan says. “It’s just funny that every year they consistently hold what I would consider to be the best punk show in Boston for the entire year,” drummer Dan Madden adds.
While DST tours outside of both the region and the nation, the band continues to play a mix of local clubs like the Middle East and local basements, though they say they have more fun at the basement shows, where the tight-knit DIY community is really felt.
“The basement, it’s more of a community-based thing, ’cause it’s the same people,” Madden says. “You see them there whether they’re playing the show with you or not.”
“Everyone’s contributing in some sort of way,” guitarist Jay St. Claire says. “People are making zines and handing them out at shows. Everyone from the band to the audience is doing something.” 
“I think that for us, going to shows that you’re not playing, it’s a thing like when other people go to bars,” guitarist Sean Yeaton says. “It’s just become part of our routine, or just our general interest, or where we hang out.”
According to Angela Sawyer, the owner of Central Square’s Weirdo Records and singer of Exusamwa—a band that is led by former WHRB president Doug M. DeMay ’94—this sense of a true community is what sets Boston apart from places like New York. “To me, it’s the best combination of small town and big city,” she says.
Though Ercal says the hardcore scene is now more of a hobby than a main focus for him, he still sees value in its community aspect. “It’s just a ton of energy,” he says. “Probably the best thing about those types of shows is you can always talk to the musicians, you can always just go up and say, ‘Hey, this was awesome,’ and ask them what you want. You’re watching other bands with the headlining bands in those concerts.”
RH FEST 

Saying that the DIY community is centered on hardcore music can be misleading, because it masks the diversity of bands within the scene. Asked to describe his band’s sound, Bogan calls it “post-hardcore art-rock jazz indie.” “I think it’s best keeping it to punk,” St. Claire interjects. “It’s punk. It’s loud.”
“I tell people [Exusamwa is] a hardcore band,” Sawyer says. “Not because it sounds hardcore. Some of the songs are fast and loud.”
That diversity was on full display two weeks ago at this year’s RH Fest. Around 100 people circulated through on each of the nights, the first of which was held at The Advocate, the second at Holden Chapel in Harvard Yard. Appropriately for a DIY show, the only monetary compensation the bands received was to cover the costs of transportation.
The Fest opened with the three-chord garage rock of Thick Shakes, which quickly gave way to the long, intricate, feedback-heavy compositions of Life Partners. Exusamwa combined manic punk with a performance art aesthetic—Sawyer spent the entire set in a wheelchair, her face bandaged and her voice howling, while her bandmates all wore red-stained OR scrubs—and Quits played experimental noise music. Daniel Striped Tiger played a cleaner, jazz-infused brand of post-hardcore, while L’Antietam’s heavier, more distorted songs featured complex tempo changes and polyrhythms. The audience had no difficulty moshing during the sludge hardcore of Connecticut’s Iron Hand before sitting down to take in the melodic finger-picked folk of New Hampshire’s Redwing Blackbird.
“It was definitely the best time we’ve played Boston,” says Brian Thompson of the Connecticut band Dead Uncles, whose Friday set got the crowd slam dancing and moshing with enthusiasm. But this wasn’t the brutal, violent moshing featured on the notorious DVD “Boston Beatdown,” which focused on a different hardcore scene that many on RH deride as “bro-core.” RH comper Jacob N. Augenstern ’10 spent the set moshing with and leaping on a local punk rocker, but afterwards, the two patted each other on the back and introduced themselves. “It’s not necessarily overtly violent in nature, even though it’s this really aggressive music,” Augenstern says.
Augenstern would know the difference. The Hull, Mass. native was introduced to Boston’s hardcore obsession in high school. “In the same breath I found out about The Clash I found out about [iconic D.C. hardcore band] Minor Threat,” he says. Augenstern threw himself into Boston’s more hard-edged hardcore scene but was eventually driven away by the violence. Finding RH and the DIY scene it supports has brought him back. “There is definitely a different sense of urgency, of passion, of spirit to it that isn’t there in this fake hardcore, this tough guy stuff,” he says.
Humphreville draws a “larger distinction between different approaches to punk: people who want it to be positive and create and people who just want to fuck shit up.” For her, the tendency of some at Harvard to stereotype all punk rockers as violent anarchists is problematic, and it can make setting up shows difficult. “I think the administration too easily puts an emphasis on more traditional forms of expression sometimes at the expense of more alternative shows that can be a really positive thing,” she says. “I think the majority of people just want to create, want to get something out there, want to have an alternative form of expression that’s not mediated by the mainstream.”
And though RH has often had difficulty expanding this alternative form of expression across the student body, it continues to fill an important role for the local DIY scene and its essential community element. “That’s really the closest it gets to a religious experience to me, where a whole community comes together to celebrate whatever it is that a certain band is going on about,” Augenstern says. “[RH is] about preserving that community and that sense of community.”

Fair Britannia is at war! All behold, as the drama unfolds in what historians will surely come to call “The Battle of the British Underdogs.” Or maybe they’ll call it “The Great Sob-Story Shootout at Schadenfreude City.” Granted, no bullets will be fired in this battle, and no blood will be drawn. I write, of course, of the recent developments on the television program “Britain’s Got Talent,” our former colonizers’ “American Idol” equivalent. By now, you’ve probably seen the all-too-perfect video of contestant Susan Boyle’s crowd-wowing rendition of Les Miserables’ “I Dreamed a Dream.” If you haven’t, perhaps you’ve heard her background story—hailing from Blackburn, Scotland, she is a middle-aged, unemployed charity worker who, after caring for her recently deceased mother, now lives alone with a 10-year-old cat named Peebles. Perhaps you “can’t write this stuff,” but there is no doubt that you can edit it heavily for public consumption.While Boyle is undoubtedly a talented songstress, it has been the moving narrative behind her performance that has taken Britain and the world by storm. In a recent interview with London’s Daily Mirror, Boyle, who purportedly used to carry her money around the village in an empty whiskey bottle, noted that she thought she looked like “a garage” when she first saw herself on television. The audience and judges in live attendance that day, at least at first, seemed to agree with her self-appraisal. They jeered at the middle-aged Scottish cat lady, audibly laughing when she said that she dreamed of becoming the next Elaine Page, the woman widely known to be the “First Lady of British Musical Theater.” One could think of her performance as a sort of anti-synesthetic experience, as the sound that emerged from her corpulence was quite the opposite of what she looks like. Boyle’s voice was youthful, absorbing, assured and remarkably feminine—not a set of qualities that could be ascribed to her appearance. It is this dichotomy in particular—notably the seamless transition between initial derision and the audience’s eventual, benevolent embracement of her—that has been the driving force behind Boyle’s recent popularity. It comes as no surprise then that the most willfully nasty among us—cough, cough, “Got Talent” creator Simon Cowell—seem so drawn to the concept of Susan Boyle. Upon any sort of consideration, however, the idea of “a Susan Boyle” reveals itself to be as artificial as Cowell’s malevolent public persona. Though her story is moving, it has certainly been carefully constructed by the show’s producers to allow Boyle’s supporters to assert their capacity for compassion, their belief in hope and possibility. In all likelihood, the only people attending Susan Boyle’s live performance genuinely surprised by her abilities were members of the audience. The idea that Cowell did not know exactly who Boyle was before she came on stage, what she was capable of, and how she might perform, is entirely unbelievable.The same goes for the contestant who is widely predicted to be her fiercest competition, 12-year-old Shaheen Jafargholi. If the concatenation of events that led to The Susan Boyle Phenomenon seemed slightly improbable,  Jafargholi’s story approaches science fiction. Seconds into the young boy’s spot-on performance of Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie,” the audience having risen to their feet to clap along, judge Cowell calls for the music to be stopped. “You’ve got this really wrong,” he said, feigning disappointment. “What do you sing apart from that?” In what is surely a bizarre coincidence, the show’s producers happened to have a track of the very backup song the boy wanted to sing, “Who’s Loving You” by the Jackson 5, already cued. While the other judges reacted to the preternaturally talented young crooner by dropping their jaws and slapping their cheeks, Cowell simply sat back in his chair and grinned. Everything had gone as planned.  This season, “Britain’s Got Talent” has two wildly popular contestants on its hands—both of whom, paradoxically, the public considers underdogs—attracting more attention to the show than ever before. Will the public choose Jafargholi, who lives with his single mother and cat? Or Boyle, a single woman, who until recently lived with her mother and cat? Will we choose the mannish old woman or the girlish young boy? But to think that who wins this fight is up to any of us, to think that the public will be presented with unbiased representations of Boyle and Jafargholi’s talent, is to be naïve. And isn’t that what great television accomplishes—instilling in us the belief that something is real, allowing us to access the joy that blind belief affords?The real battle in British television is not between the contestants and the judges, nor is it even between the contestants themselves. The real battle is a war against our better judgment, a struggle to convince us that a woman can emote a love ballad without ever having been kissed (as Ms. Boyle has stated of herself) or that a young boy from a broken home can rise to superstardom. In some viewers, the battle has already been won. Both of the contestants have received praise from twittering couple Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher. Rosie O’Donnell has even, I kid you not, posted a 32 line poem on her website inspired by Boyle entitled “when magic happens.”But as Jafargholi’s mother Karen noted in a recent interview with The Mirror, Shaheen does not in fact come from “broken home,” as “Talent” producers might slyly imply. While she did separate from the boy’s father a few years back, she’s sure to proclaim that,“It’s all amicable... we’re not another sob story.” This is not to say that we should deny our reactions to Boyle or Jafargholi’s performances or that we shouldn’t tune in and enjoy shows like “Britain’s Got Talent.” But if we come to actually believe in the reality of reality television, unlimitedly accessing the joy of that “blind belief,” we risk abandoning what is actually real. Or at least misplacing it for a while.—Staff writer Ruben L. Davis can be reached at rldavis@fas.harvard.edu.

Though Harvard boasts any number of poets, novelists, and actors among its alumni, it curiously (or perhaps not so curiously) lacks on the list of illustrious elite in one group of artists: rappers. The hustling thug-life portrayed by popular rappers may seem incongruous with Harvard’s academic atmosphere, but for the participants of OUTWIT 2009, the combination of Harvard and hip-hop could allow audiences to overcome any preconceived notions of the two. OUTWIT, a freestyle rap competition that also features spoken word, beatbox, and song, is an annual event held by Tuesday Magazine—taking place this year on April 26 in Ticknor Lounge—that offers an opportunity for students to exercise their lyrical prowess and creativity. Tuesday, a self-proclaimed general interest magazine, seeks to publish works from a broad spectrum of genres that might not have other venues for expression. OUTWIT is a manifestation of this mission. “We try to find the undiscovered talent at Harvard, the weird little quirky niches that no one gets to see, and OUTWIT is another way to showcase that,” says May M. Zhang ’10, Tuesday Magazine’s Co-President. In its third year, OUTWIT mainly showcases rappers, who tease each other with rhythm and rhyme in order to win the favor of judges and crowd. “OUTWIT shows the other side of Harvard that competes with our image as a stuffy, upper-class, pretentious, white collar institution,” Zhang says, “Instead, this side of Harvard is spontaneous, fun, and clever.”While spoken word maintains a presence at Harvard with organizations such as the Spoken Word Society, rap still hasn’t found a formal way to enter the Harvard culture. OUTWIT is the sole public forum for freestyle rap battles on campus, but the continued interests that students have expressed towards the competition suggest that an underground force for the art form exists. Most of the competitors began rapping before high school; after coming to college, they have found few opportunities to practice their skills.For OUTWIT veteran Lev A. Shaket ’10, rap battles were a part of his high school culture in Atlanta. At Harvard, he tries to keep sharp by informally rapping to friends. “You have to rap a lot to yourself and that’s the only way you get better,” Shaket says. Though he isn’t aware of any substantial rap scene at Harvard, he notes that one exists in the greater Boston area; Shaket often competes off-campus in Allston, Boston, and East Cambridge. He claims that knowledge of upcoming rap battles is often spread via word-of-mouth by individuals who are already involved in the scene. “It depends on the people you know and who can hook you up,” Shaket says.For Shaket, one of these people is Daniel J. Thorn ’11, a DJ and music director of TDS (The Darker Side), WHRB’s hip-hop department. In the past, Thorn has arranged for Shaket to battle with local and traveling rappers who have contacted the station in search of competition. Though there is no official organization for rappers at Harvard, TDS is an informal arena where those who are interested in hip-hop culture can congregate. “A bunch of the people at The Darker Side are interested in rap and hip-hop culture,” Thorn says. “It’s a part of our department that we have our own freestyle battles sometimes. When new members join our station we usually make them freestyle. We have to test out their rhyming skills.”Outside of the community that TDS has created for the art form, knowledge and support for rap remains obscure in Harvard culture. OUTWIT competitor Jarell L. Lee ’10 feels that this lack of presence stems from the tendency for rap to be misunderstood. “I don’t think people at Harvard appreciate it enough,” Lee says. “They don’t understand that you listen to it exactly like you listen to poetry—for similes, metaphors and alliteration... Even songs that seem to be ‘about nothing’ have a real poetic element to them, and it’s wasted on people who don’t take the time to think about them.” Lee, who began rapping in seventh grade and continued in high school as a gospel rapper, emphasizes that rap can be a highly constructive force. “I think rap has a really powerful influence, and it’s unfortunate that more rap lyrics are not about positive things, because one can really feel uplifted and empowered through music,” Lee says; personally, he prefers to craft songs, rather than battle. “It’s much easier to rap about negative things than positive things.”According to Shaket, however, freestyling is more about impressing listeners with clever wordplay than it is about disparaging an opponent. “One component is punch lines. It’s good to be funny—audiences love funny punch lines,” he says. “Also there has to be a tight flow, in the way you string things together and how you have to mold the words to accentuate the beat. The master is able to weave all these things together.”For Shaket and the other participants of OUTWIT, winning will mean measuring up to the event’s namesake. “We call it a battle of the wits,” Zhang says. “It’s a battle. And it’s competitive.”—Staff writer Tiffany Chi can be reached at tchi@fas.harvard.edu.

The paintings of the Fogg and Busch-Reisinger collections have already moved out of 32 Quincy Street. Early this summer, the 434,000 books, periodicals, and auction catalogs and over 1 million photographs and prints of the Fine Arts Library collection will also leave. As renovations to the Harvard Art Museum building begin, the Fine Arts Library is gearing up to move to two temporary locations in the basements of the Sackler Museum and Littauer Center. Transporting this huge volume of materials, however, is no easy task. Preparations for the move have been underway for nearly two years. The digital images and slides, including 95,000 glass lantern slides and 750,000 teaching images, will be moved to the lower level of the Sackler Museum in early June, and will reopen there on June 15. “This collection is heavily used by the faculty for teaching purposes, so this being in the Sackler is logistically great” says Beth S. Brainard, spokesperson for the Harvard College Libraries, who added that the design school will also benefit from proximity to these materials.The books, photographs, and graphic images will go to the basement of the Littauer building in the North Yard, which formerly held the economics and government departmental library, now housed in Lamont. As a result, stacks were already in place at the Littauer facility. The move will take place in early July, and the new location will reopen July 7. Any materials that cannot fit in the five miles of shelves at the Littauer facility, including photographs and prints, will be stored temporarily at the Harvard Depository until the new Fine Arts Library reopens in the Harvard Art Museum building.Julia E. Schlozman ’09, an HAA concentrator, says she was sentimental about the separation between the museum collection and the library. “I used to love walking through the courtyard and having to pass a 12th century sculpture as I did so,” she says. “I haven’t been able to do that this year, and you certainly won’t be able to do that at Littauer.”Still, finding a space this close to the History of Art and Architecture department offices was “remarkable,” according to department chair Thomas B.F. Cummins, who toured numerous facilities on campus before the selection of the Littauer Center. “It’s in spitting distance,” he says. “I walk to Widener, why can’t I walk there?”So far, the project is on schedule, and librarians have begun to tour members of the History of Art and Architecture faculty as well as graduate students around the new Littauer facility. “It’s going beautifully. The space is almost complete,” Brainard says, noting that the only construction work left was finishing work in the stacks. As librarians organize and inventory everything in the collections in preparation for the laborious move, they are inevitably stumbling across new finds. Several thousand posters, lithographs, and engravings, for example, were rediscovered in the photograph collection. Originally stored in Widener, these materials were moved to the Fine Arts Library not because they were necessarily artworks but simply because it was the only library that stored flat materials. Their subject matter ranges from politics to health and hygiene and are from a wide range of time periods. Recent finds also include a copy of the architectural plans for Grand Central Station, a photograph of a scoreboard from a World Series game with Babe Ruth’s name on it, and autochromes (early color photographs on glass) by the Lumière brothers of filmmaking fame. The Portrait Collection, the bulk of which was donated in the early 20th century by Evert J. Wendell 1882, spans the ages, from 16th century engravings to 1920s photographs. Objects in the collection range from engravings of French military uniforms to an entire set of cigarette boxing cards, equivalent to modern-day trading cards. On top of leading to the discovery of new materials, the move has provided an opportunity for reorganization of the collection. Materials that have sat in files and drawers are now being catalogued in HOLLIS and VIA (Visual Information Access) for the first time. Japanese albums containing largely hand-colored albumen prints, photographs of Renaissance and Baroque architecture and sculpture, records of Nicaragua before and after the 1979 revolution, and photographs documenting a 1922 road trip from Pakistan to Afghanistan are among the objects that will now be made available on HOLLIS. While the benefits of cataloguing will be enjoyed by generations of future Harvard students, the Littauer location is only temporary. Pending approval, the Fine Arts Library is likely to move into the Sackler building sometime around 2017. Gallery space in the Sackler will be converted into teaching space for use by the History of Art and Architecture Department, as well as the library, when the renovated Harvard Art Museum building reopens and can accommodate the Fogg, Sackler, and Busch-Reisinger collections.—Staff writer Alexandra Perloff-Gilles can be reached at aperloff@fas.harvard.edu.

On her twenty-sixth birthday, Jessica Darling runs into her ex-boyfriend at the airport.  When he learns Jessica missed her flight, Marcus fabricates his own travel mishap. Stranded together for 12 hours, they finally sort out their decade long history, without particular emphasis what happened in the three years since she turned down his marriage proposal. “Perfect Fifths,” Megan McCafferty’s fifth novel, is light reading, but it’s also an intelligent, stylized, humorous exploration of the psychology of memory and narrative.  Since McCafferty’s debut “Sloppy Firsts,” the Jessica Darling Series has never been firmly in one genre or directly targeted at a clear audience. The first few books straddled the boundary between young adult and mainstream fiction, and as the protagonist and authorial risks have matured, McCafferty has positioned herself between “chick-lit” and more literary-minded fiction. On appearances and plot summary alone, “Perfect Fifths” seems to fall squarely within the realm of the former, but there is a psychological depth to the light, funny diction that would ordinarily make a novel targeted at young women a “quick read.”Plotwise, the novel relies heavily on the background of the previous four books. A unified referential significance of events and dialogue proves McCafferty’s skill at tying up and explaining questions left throughout the series. Most of the time she sews meaning cleverly enough to avoid overt exposition. Couching explanation in witty, realistic dialogue, McCafferty gets away with telling a lot more than would normally be acceptable.However, as a work in isolation, “Perfect Fifths” is heavy on back-story and characters that are mentioned briefly but never seem to appear. These hanging details may be a source of annoyance for uninitiated readers: performer Barry Manilow’s music, for instance, has been a thread running through the series. McCafferty uses his songs, such as “Ready To Take A Chance Again” and “Can’t Smile Without You” as a metaphor for Jessica and Marcus’s relationship. But bringing in a Vegas-bound tour group of elderly Manilow fans and having them stay at the same hotel as Jessica and Marcus is a quirk in the story that strays close to too convenient to ring true.Suspension of disbelief at his repeated appearances aside, the choice of Barry Manilow as a motif works toward the ongoing theme of Jessica at once decrying and embracing the maudlin. Just as she tries to take herself seriously, she’s brought down humorously.Conveyed directly, irony seems only a result of hyper-focused preoccupation with her own life. When the situations she finds herself in are instead rendered from an objective perspective, it ceases to suggest she’s creating the plot-like quality of her life for herself. The use of third person lends an enhancing element of dramatic irony through seeing both Jessica and Marcus’s processing of the same present events and histories as they diverged from the same point.“Perfect Fifths” renders an interesting balance between intimacy and distance of characterization. It is primarily third person, a departure from the first-person letters and diary entries that were the rest of the series. Throughout the novel, McCafferty branches into more unconventional forms. One chapter is written in haikus that alternates between the perspectives of Jessica and Marcus. Another section is entirely rapid-fire dialogue. These sections punch up the emotional power of the prose.They also contrast with the distancing effect of the rest of the book, a trade-off to access both main characters’ interiors. The climax is written in fragmented phrases from the rest of the series, strung together to suggest the onslaught of associative memory inside the characters minds. McCafferty is at her best in first-person, but this change in point of view deals appropriately with the questions of narrative and memory that “Perfect Fifths,” uniquely, seems to engage. McCafferty takes this one step further when Jessica discusses the merits of using third-person writing in a narrative therapy project to empower high school girls: “‘We call this writing exercise the turning point of view. The change in narrative perspective triggers an internal psychological shift that allows you to see past decisions in a whole new way.  It’s similar to when you see a friend making a huge mistake and it’s just so obvious.’”And so “Perfect Fifths” becomes a meta-fiction, and even its narrative point of view serves the themes of memory and revision. If it is chick-lit, it stretches the genre’s limits, keeping the best of its readability and trading fluff for wit.—Staff writer Chelsea L. Shover can be reached at clshover@fas.harvard.edu.

John Wray, author of the new and notable “Lowboy,” has not had an easy way as a novelist. He wrote his debut, 2001’s “The Right Hand of Sleep,” in a tent in the basement of a Brooklyn warehouse, where he would by-now-famously listen to rats copulate. For his second book, 2005’s “Canaan’s Tongue,” he did his publicity tour by raft down the Mississippi in a (failed) attempt to get people to notice him. New York Times writer David Carr even tagged along for a stretch, and the book couldn’t sell 3,000 copies. I want to say this up front: I like “Lowboy.” It’s a good book. There was something about the quote I’m about to give you from Carr’s Times piece, though, that when I read it just felt true. He said—and here’s the quote—“It is, in all, a thoroughly modern, calculated public relations enterprise, but its ancient charms are remarkable.” That’s just it: “Lowboy” is an incredibly competent novel from a young, clearly passionate writer. I want it to succeed. I want him to succeed. But it doesn’t have the feeling of a breakthrough. The titular “Lowboy” is William Heller, a 16-year-old paranoid schizophrenic who goes off his meds and goes on a manic journey through the New York City subway system. The contemporary subject-matter is a departure for Wray, whose last two novels have taken place in pre-war Austria and the antebellum South. He told New York Magazine that the more palatable setting pick “had something to do with wanting to survive as a writer. Sooner or later it would be nice if I could make my publisher some money.” It’s not that “Lowboy” belongs at a supermarket checkout counter, but the more I read the more I realized he was telling me things I already knew. A great novel is magical—this was more like an eerily accurate palm reading, skillfully executed and titillating in its own way, but content to keep out of the great beyond. For instance, Wray flexes all of his considerable writerly muscle getting into Will’s schizoid mind and voice— obviously disturbed and yet disarmingly intelligent, with a palpable vein of violence in his otherwise gentle personality—but the fact that the character is mentally ill does half of his dirty work for him. There is no need to drum up sympathy for a teenager with schizophrenia, even if he did throw his best friend onto the subway tracks. “It was hot in the station,” Will explains to said friend. “You’d gone flat, playing tricks, not like Emily at all. I wanted to cool down. I wanted to take my clothes off. Then you came and wrapped around me like a blanket.” Sick kids have always sold well, everywhere from novels like Faulkner’s “The Sound and the Fury” to commercials for St. Jude’s research hospital. Wray doesn’t have to do the difficult and virtuosic work of setting up a fictional environment in which Will’s violence is forgivable. It’s the schizophrenia defense. Will’s twisted logic unspools over time, but never is there an instant’s doubt that the incident isn’t fully justified by the illness. Wray lets Will tell his own story half the time, and gives the other half to Detective Ali Lateef, who’s leading the subway-centric manhunt. The novel is ripe with divergent identities: Will and his alter ego, “Lowboy”; his mother Yda and Lowboy’s name for her, “Violet;” Lateef and his given name, “Rufus White.” The alternating perspectives of the narrative themselves constitute a sort of double identity, mirroring the dynamic between the world of institutions above ground and the dank, chaotic world of the subway, where Will feels most at home. The universe is schizophrenic, and even the normal characters like Lateef become different people underground. The perspective gets handed back and forth every chapter, which becomes monotonous over time and feels artificial as the story itself gets more dynamic. Still, the alternation lets Wray probe Will’s psyche from a number of different angles without having to stop and reflect, Victorian novel-style. Lateef, on the other hand, is a stock character; the spiritually exhausted public servant, who experiences a mid-career crisis of confidence and develops an inappropriate affection for Violet Heller. Somehow it seems like this is supposed to illustrate the novel’s metaphysical import. It just doesn’t really work. Lots of things about the novel do work. Wray deposits moments of exposition at key points in his apparent madcap narrative, showing the careful planning and loving consideration of a first-rate writing talent. His prose flies along with the unstoppable force of a subway train, but he can still make me pause and wring my heart out over poor Lowboy. We have 258 heart-wrenching pages on this kid, but none of them answers the question of why write a single one. Sure, he has schizophrenia, but that’s simply a fact of his fictional life no matter how much it tugs at my heartstrings. So—what? If I’m going to invest myself in “Lowboy”—or in John Wray, for that matter—I need to know that his story matters not just to his mother and him. I need to know that it matters to me. Wray still has plenty of novels left in him, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed that his next one will be the one. Even now I’m not complaining. Only hoping. Like I said, I like “Lowboy”—because it’s likable, though, not because it’s great. —Staff writer Jillian J. Goodman can be reached at jjgoodm@fas.harvard.edu.

Things rarely come in groups of six. Sextuplets (by birth or in a boy band) are uncommon and overwhelming, while musical arrangements are more likely to be written for a quartet or a quintet. Because of this, if the word sestet rings a bell, it is likely that the cognizance dates back to your high school unit on poetry. The sestet is commonly known as the last 6 lines of a sonnet, usually demarcating a turn in thought. And though a sestet can be any six-lined stanza or poem, with “Sestets,” the latest volume of poetry by Charles Wright, it is helpful to think of that one. As the 20th volume for the poet—a Pulitzer and Griffin Prize winner—“Sestets” marks a high point in the progress of a style of contemplation that Wright has made his own over the years.Although Wright has always shown a skill for distilling an experience and recording its essence, his “Sestets” are, by the definition of their form, pithier than previous poems. In these nearly haiku-like meditations, Wright recursively combs over symbols he sees around him in the natural world as he circles around death and the meaning of life. The opening line of the collection reads, “The metaphysics of the quotidian was what he was after.” The “he” could easily stand in for the author.Throughout these poems Wright is acutely aware of the passage of time, and this is what drives his repeated examination of the nature surrounding him. The cyclical nature of his writing reflects the changing seasons that form a backdrop spanning the collection. In 68 of these compact studies, one would think that the poet would find answers in the nature he returns to so frequently. But it becomes apparent after a time that he seems to find his answers, more than in these meditations, in the act of writing.Over the course of the collection, Wright gradually introduces the metaphorical relationship between language and life. In “Tomorrow,” the first poem, Wright suggests that life has already been written “on the flyleaf of the Book of Snow.” Later he looks at language not as a tool of the “merciless” future but of his own understanding. In “Sundown Blues,” he realizes “There are some things that can’t be conveyed—/ description, for instance.” In the very next line he goes on to try: “The sundown light on that dog-hair lodgepole pine and the dead branches of spruce trees.”In this volume, Wright draws on every source he can—religion, science, mythology, and even popular music—to try to pin down an image or emotion. “Sundown Blues” concludes with the “sundown light” he had just described “chameleoning” away and captures the feeling with the down-to-earth rhythms of a southern spiritual: “No one is able to describe this gold to bronze to charcoal, no one. / So move along, boy, just move along.” He confounds the problem of understanding life with the problem of writing about it—its subject matter is too complex and ever-shifting for the human abilities to capture.Wright’s attempt to understand life through words draws him to songs from the folk tradition. His poems often go beyond imitating folk rhythms and diction to quoting directly from songs. Pieces of lyrics waft through his poems as they cross the narrator’s consciousness—for example “Rhinestone Cowboy,” the title of a song by Glen Campbell, and “Such a wonderful spot, there’s coffee and bananas and the temperature’s hot,” from a song by Freddy Martin. In a poem entitled “Tuttie Frutti,” Wright quotes Little Richard—“A-wop-bop-a-loo a-lop-bam-boo,” concluding, “What could be better than that?” Wright is fascinated by the sensations conveyed by words, and these mentions to outside works help anchor poems that may otherwise be too abstract to a world the reader knows.One of the many references made throughout these poems is to Gerald Manley Hopkins, the 19th-century British poet and Jesuit Priest. Hopkins himself struggled to understand the world and did so by finding God behind the exquisite beauty he saw in nature. Wright’s poems find beauty as well, but his world view is much more nebulous than that of Hopkins. “Who was it who first said, ‘The kingfisher falls through fire’?” asks Wright, twisting around the opening line of Hopkins’ famous poem, “As Kingfishers Catch Fire.” Like Wright’s descriptions throughout the collection, his misquotation prioritizes his subjective impression of the poem over Hopkins’ own words. The objects in this world are escaping his grasp, and once more Wright shows how his struggle with “the metaphysical” can be transferred to his struggle with language.The final poem in “Sestets” is entitled “Little Ending.” “Later,” he writes, “...Someone will take our hand, someone will give us refuge, / Circling left or circling right.” The answer as to what lies behind death has finally arrived, but it is incredibly—and intentionally—vague. However, after seeing Wright’s struggle to describe the present, his nondescript conclusion seems fitting. In his philosophy, capturing the essence of things is more important than the thing itself, and in these last two lines he manages to relate the sense of security.The word “God,” which appears in previous poems, is noticeably absent from “Little Ending.” The who and what are left undefined, and that is the point—understanding is not so important as trying to understand.—Staff writer Rebecca A. Schuetz can be reached at schuetz@fas.harvard.edu.

Miami rapper Rick Ross’s highly anticipated third album, “Deeper than Rap,” is, frankly, not that deep at all. In fact, in today’s pool of rap material, the CD would sit right on the surface. While Ross is generally entertaining and enjoyable, listeners who scrutinize each song will be unsuccessful in their searcch for what sets the album apart. Laden with trends such as predictable guest cameos and treble-heavy synthesized tunes, Ross’s album may as well be titled “Rap.”Ross was propelled into the spotlight in 2006 with the success of “Port of Miami” and its sales-driving hit singles, such as “Hustlin’,” “Push It,” and “Blow,” all of which unabashedly illustrate the rapper’s rise from lowly cocaine slinger to “Rick Ross, Boss,” the high profile trafficker with a successful rap career.On “Deeper than Rap,” Ross continues to tell this customary story of the gangster’s American dream, employing his signature overt metaphors and clever lyrical innuendos to demonstrate his experiences and successes in the drug trade and the rap game.  Certainly, the album’s unoriginality is indicative of the times in hip-hop. Though Ross’s album features a variety of appearances—from tenured authorities such as Nas to some leading next-generation artists such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne, The-Dream, and Ne-Yo—the all-star cast mainly provides gentle, melodious hooks laid over the upbeat electronic tunes that have infiltrated hip-hop full force as of late.As a result, “Deeper than Rap” has a softer overall sound than Ross’ first two albums. Better suited for the six-CD changer of a white Lexus on a sunny Saturday than the dusty tape deck of a black Impala on a dreary Monday, “Deeper than Rap” gives listeners the feeling that Ross is getting used to his new lifestyle. The “I made it” attitude, as opposed to “This is how I made it” or “This is how it was before I made it,” seems to take the front seat, as has happened with superstar rappers such as Jay-Z and 50 Cent over the course of their careers.  In “Usual Suspects” (feat. Nas), the hook boasts “We the usual suspects / the real definition of success / throwin’ money ’cause I can and I love it / from nothing to something.”In the more frankly titled “Rich off Cocaine,” Ross finally attempts to get “deeper.” He becomes critical of his lifestyle and material obsession: “Vacation to Haiti / It nearly broke my heart / Seein’ kids starve, I thought about my Audemar / Sellin’ dope ain’t right / I put it on my life.” Still, no unique message is conveyed.While “Deeper than Rap” meets all current requirements for a decent hip-hop album, it still leaves much to be desired. One song in particular is exemplary of the fact that listeners will find what they expect to find, but nothing more. “Maybach Music 2” provides an accurate summary of what seems to be the only correct recipe, give or take an artist, for popular remixes and song sequels over the past two years: an Auto-Tuned chorus from T-Pain, lyrics about basking in gratuitous luxuries, and 16 bars from Weezy or Yeezy. “Maybach Music 2” has every such ingredient.Listeners who have grown weary of the Auto-Tune gang (Kanye, T-Pain, The-Dream, etc.) and pop rappers taking over their local radio stations can find consolation in songs such as “Mafia Music,” the album’s opening track, and “In Cold Blood,” the album’s closing track. Both tracks are darker and more contemplative than most of the others. On “Mafia Music,” Ross interestingly positions himself with icons in black history: “Martin had a dream, Bob got high / I still do both but somehow I got by.” On “In Cold Blood,” Ross employs jazz trumpets and orchestral sounds, as he proclaims, “God wanna see you niggas in the Bentley!” These bookends provide memorable first and last impressions, as they encapsulate the MTV-ready middle portion of the album.Regardless, very little about “Deeper than Rap” conveys any sense of lyrical or compositional originality. From the recycled analogies and familiar “hip-pop” melodies to the clichéd Scarface-esque album cover, “Deeper than Rap” does not stand out. Ross does little more than reference the themes of ascent, extravagance, and egocentric introspection that are ordinary in mainstream hip-hop today. While it is undoubtedly a good listen full of catchy tunes and everyone’s favorite personalities, “Deeper than Rap” does not live up to its ambitious title.

“Dark Days/Light Years” is a title that captures the spirit not so much of Super Furry Animals’ new album but rather of their entire career. The Welsh five-piece—whose eclectic oeuvre has been variously described as psychedelia and power pop—have always cast light and darkness about them with equal measure—never more so than on their 2003 magnum opus, “Phantom Power,” where upbeat, frenetic melodies and beats were counterbalanced by wistful lyrics. While its sound is characteristically SFA, “Dark Days/Light Years” is a break from this tradition of point-counterpoint; it is the closest SFA have ever come to genuine, unqualified happiness. The songs on this album revel in a joyous silliness that might seem cutesy in the hands of a less experienced band. But Super Furry Animals are grizzled veterans—this is their ninth studio album—and “Dark Days/Light Years” feels effortless, the work of a highly skilled group of musicians having fun with each other.The prevailing happiness does not preclude SFA from ambition or from surprising the listener; after all, sudden and often bizarre sonic transitions are a tradition with this band. Take the opener, “Crazy Naked Girls,” which begins with random noise that leads into a simple, maddeningly addictive riff in a manner reminiscent of Pavement’s “Silence Kit.” With crisp, brief, repeated verses and a twin-falsetto chorus—“crazy, crazy, naked girls”—it is a perfect piece of fuzz pop that is implanted in the consciousness at the first listen, before a distortion-heavy guitar solo transposes the song into the genre of drugged-out epic. At over six minutes, “Crazy Naked Girls” is a demanding song, but the listener is easily hooked from the start.The finest moments of this majestic album are its effervescent pop songs. Perhaps the best song on “Dark Days/Light Years” is “Inaugural Trams”, which opens with Franz Ferdinand’s Nick McCarthy counting in German. It is a sweetly silly love song as well as, yes, a tribute to trams: “Let us celebrate this monument of progress / We have reduced emissions by 75%.” Frontman Gruff Rhys sings, “I will design the town in the image of your face / Round the wrinkles of your eyes my footsteps you can trace,” his near-falsetto perfectly suiting both the playful lyrics and the gorgeous melody. The lyrics play on both environmentalism and the economy; not only does Rhys rhyme “depression” with “recession,” but he does so in a setting that renders both those words devoid of any negative power. The interspersing of Rhys’ vocals with McCarthy’s near-garbled German elevates “Inaugural Trams” to the level of comic masterpiece.In a musical marketplace where attempts at indie rock humor that fall flat are a dime a dozen, Super Furry Animals truly stand out. They have two key strengths: an acute sense of the ridiculous and a wonderful sense of timing. Any band that can pull off the lines “I look like a loser / Coming from a gutter” and “It’s cool to find what keeps us all together” without the slightest hint of cutesy or pretension has earned the right to sing almost anything. There is the occasional moment where the silliness can go a little too far, as on “Mt,” the tale of a not so “big fucking mountain” that is “no ordinary mountain” because it is “two foot tall” and “oh so small,” but this song is the album’s only real misstep.The vocals, in keeping with the album’s loose, relaxed feel, are a team effort in which each of SFA’s members write and sing. This cohesion comes naturally to a band that has played together for nearly two decades. Their state of comfortable maturity is also evident in their homages to their Welsh roots, both on “Cardiff in the Sun,” a tribute to the Welsh capital, and “Lliwiau Llachar,” their first song in Welsh since their 2000 decision to start singing exclusively in English. On the evidence of “Lliwiau Llachar,” a Beach Boys-esque specimen of pop harmonizing, this album would be a compelling listen even if all the lyrics were incomprehensible to the non-Welsh listener. “Dark Days/Light Years” is as compelling a reminder as any album in 2009 that the greatest thing a band can hope to provide its audience is pure aural enjoyment. This hour’s worth of music is consistently funny and engaging, but most of all, it just sounds good. If these be Dark Days, give us more of them.

Chester French’s much anticipated debut album, “Love the Future,” is a tour de force scarcely seen in contemporary pop music. The duo of Maxwell C. Drummey ’07 and D. A. Wallach ’07 string their audience along a tangled thread of kitchsy singles, Beach Boy flavored ballads, musical interludes, and even some country twang over the course of the record. And while this errant diversity could otherwise be more than a little off-putting, Chester French pulls it off (though not without a few stumbles) with a gusto that’s sure to recall a Beatles album or two for the historically-minded listener.The eclectic composition of “Love the Future” is both its boon and its bane. It reveals Chester French as more than just mass produced musicians, but occasionally this multifarious bent also leads to painful failures. Such missteps, however, are generally eclipsed by the stronger songs that surround them and the disc’s overall composition, which makes its 13 tracks fly by in a pleasurable breeze.“Beneath the Veil,” which opens simply with a brisk bluegrass guitar rhythm and Wallach’s voice dancing on the lower limits of its register before giving way to lighter fare replete with handclaps and a tambourine, is a prime example of experimental success. One part “Rocky Raccoon,” one part “Walk the Line,” “Beneath the Veil” is a joy to listen to, both for its genre-bending appeal and for its own musical merit.  “Fingers” also succeeds in these same respects. Sounding more like a Beatles ballad than anything else, the track integrates staccato piano chords, a marching beat, and some impressive orchestration to give it a simultaneously fresh and dated feel. While the lyrics are a bit more hit or miss (“And the fingers of your mind / Have wrapped around my spine / And made me feel so blind”), the retro yet contemporary feel is more than engaging enough.“The Jimmy Choos” also straddles the line between pop past and present, channeling the sunny beach sound and lyrical levity of the Beach Boys. More mainstream than the aforementioned gems, the song adeptly combines all the electronic glitz of modern pop tracks with dated but appropriate melodic riffs from Drummey and company. Standout tracks like “C’mon (On My Own)” and breakout single “She Loves Everybody” don’t quite fit the modern/retro bill of much of the rest of the album, but rather serve as bookends with more obvious mainstream appeal. Lyrically, they’re playful and intelligent, while musically their sort of the standard fare, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing on an album this diverse.The only real failures on the album are “Bebe Buell” and “Country Interlude,” although there are some tracks that are certainly less mentionable than those above. “Bebe Buell,” while perhaps the most lyrically light—“This ain’t groupie love ’cause you mean so much to me / You’re my Bebe Buell, you’re my Puerto Rican Pamela Lee”—is nonetheless overwrought in production, featuring an insipid chorus and piano line to match, not to mention the overwhelming presence of Drummey’s distorted guitar. “Country Interlude” just never really finds a voice, despite being the longest track on the album, instead meandering between instrumentalism, electronic noise, distraught and disparaged crooning, and moments of levity.“Love the Future” is as much a throwback to the past as it is a landmark for the future. Chester French succeed, however, in marrying the two into a happy and pleasurable medley that leaves little to be desired. “Love the Future” is intelligent with being pretentious, facile without seeming campy, and eclectic without being scattered. In its individual tracks and the composition of the album as a whole, it strikes a balance that, more often than not, works at both engaging and gratifying the listener, and rarely completely misses the mark. —Staff writer Joshua J.

With the 1959 releases of Miles Davis’ “Kind of Blue,” Ornette Coleman’s “The Shape of Jazz to Come,” and John Coltrane’s “Giant Steps” the world of modern jazz changed forever. Fifty years later, Harvard University continued the tradition of these modern jazz legends last Saturday by honoring drummer Roy Haynes as the 2009 Jazz Master in Residence at Harvard University in “Cracklin’ with Roy—Honoring Roy Haynes.”  Harvard has been honoring jazz masters for some 30 years, according to Thomas Everett, director of the Harvard University Band and Jazz Bands, but the unique title of Jazz Master in Residence is fairly new. While Everett admits that “1959 was really remarkable, a real turning point for modern jazz,” the 50 year anniversary is a mere—but fitting—coincidence; the honor here is all about legendary jazz drummer Roy Haynes. Everett says that a Jazz Master in Residence “usually means a senior member in the jazz community, somebody that has their own identifiable sound, and Roy, when he plays, has his own sound. He is also quite an underrated jazz master and musician that really deserves the honor.” Everett and a committee made up of several people from the Office for the Arts at Harvard and the Quincy Jones Professor of African-American Music Ingrid Monson chose Roy Haynes from the top of their list. “Roy Haynes is a living legend, a walking history of Jazz,” Everett says. Growing up in Boston near Long Wharf, Haynes “just about played with every major innovative artist since 1945, and he keeps the tradition alive,” according to Everett. Before his first New York gig with Luis Russell in 1945, Haynes was already making a name for himself as a teenager at Martha’s Vineyard playing with the likes of guitarist Tom Brown, bandleader Sabby Lewis, and saxophonist Pete Brown. Once joining Russell in New York at the renowned Savoy Ballroom, Haynes’ opportunities multiplied, allowing him to collaborate with everyone from Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, and John Coltrane to Stan Getz and Chick Corea. “[Coltrane] was one of the first artists playing an instrument to come to a climax, bring it down, and bring it right back up again,” Haynes recalls of his time playing with Coltrane just a few years after the release of “Giant Steps.” Another particularly special partnership for Haynes was with female jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughan. Playing for Vaughan had its financial and artistic benefits.“[I] liked the material things. It may be weird you know, but I wanted a house,” Haynes says. “But Sarah Vaughan, to me, was not just another singer.” Playing with Vaughan and the other jazz greats, Haynes came to realize his place in the genre: “The drummer is the heartbeat. If the heart stops beating, you’re dead.”To enhance the festivities honoring Haynes, the OFA invited special guest and Grammy-winning trumpet virtuoso Roy Hargrove. Hargrove, who recorded with Haynes on the 2001 Charlie Parker tribute “Birds of a Feather,” views Haynes as a key influence on modern jazz. In a presentation sponsored by The Harvard College American Music Association and the Harvard Jazz Bands, Hargrove said that many of the current young players are “forgetting about the main element that makes you feel good, snap your fingers—the swing.” Another aspect that Hargrove finds so important in a musician is the ability to play in any type of genre or environment. “It’s not enough to just be able to play any more,” he says. “If you are going to be playing you can’t limit yourself to being just one kind of musician. Be the player that can play in any style; be multifaceted.”Tom Everett says the committee brought Hargrove in addition “because he has had an association with Roy Haynes; we bring in a senior established jazz master and a younger musician to see the tradition is going to live on and that the sound of Roy Haynes will continue in Roy Hargrove and Harvard jazz students in the future.” He adds, “Roy Hargrove is a remarkable, diverse type of player who has a great deal of respect for Roy Haynes and together it is fascinating to watch their interaction and mutual respect and even risk; feeling so confident in their abilities, they can try out new things, improvisations they haven’t done before.” The introduction of this risk-taking musicianship is something that Everett hopes his students can experience. “Cracklin’ with Roy” allowed Harvard jazz band students an opportunity to perform with both Haynes and Hargrove. Everett hopes that these opportunities for Harvard students to play with seasoned musical celebrities will facilitate the passing on of their traditions and abilities. By playing with Roy Haynes and Roy Hargrove, Everett says, the students have the opportunity to learn from their predecessors: “The students are being passed down all that [Haynes] has learned from the people he has played with.  These students who played with him will be part of thatconnection.”

After a prolonged hiatus, Eminem is back to prove that he has graduated from his former persona as fast food worker and Bat-Dre’s sidekick. Now he’s Bret Mathers, rocker of love. But even Eminem knows his Guitar Hero skills don’t quite translate to rock singing chops, so he’s called in Dina Rae for the chorus. He’d asked Jessica Simpson to do it, but she was busy catching cheeseburgers from Tony Romo.By now, Eminem’s realized that if he’s going to make fun of so many people, he’s got to have some escape plans.  After calling Kim Kardashian a man, her “massive gluteus maximus” knocks Eminem out of his chair, but he’s already back on the Starship Enterprise with Dr. Dre. Then, after releasing some traditional homophobia, Eminem bolts from a peeved Sam Ronson—someone didn’t like being dubbed a 2 to Lindsay’s 10—by turning his 18-wheeler into a transformer.  He might’ve said he didn’t know where his career was going in 2005, but we sure know what movie theatres he was going to in 2007.  Next on his rock star trip is Alaska, where Eminem finds himself surrounded by a polar bear and an Eskimo. He starts nailin’ Palin off her governor’s desk, out of the lingerie and glasses, but oddly enough, the polar bear and Eskimo are the only ones making a Palin sandwich by the end.The climactic moment of Eminem’s trip takes him to Planet Womyn where Eminem’s wit must stand up to hoards of sword-wielding biddies.  It’s not clear who wins, but we do know one thing by the end: Dre’s “Detox” probably won’t drop until 2020, and Eminem isn’t making the wait any easier.—Colin Whelehan

From the moment the five members of Black Kids set off in their animated roller coaster car into the terrifying Tune Town tunnel, we know we’re in for a treat—and boy, do we get one! Floating past cartoon guitars and keyboards—just like the ones they use!—their yellow seats burst apart and the gang is thrust into an entirely new dimension—where light shoots in columns, winds rush from nowhere, singers wear outfits that are made of metallic purple plastic and sleek leather, and vicious guitar-playing Muppet-hunters flaunt their kills as their garb. In this world, rocking out is mandatory.Yet still, in this “Heavy Metal” meets ColecoVision universe, Black Kids find meaning in the madness. Frontman Reggie Youngblood is suddenly transplanted to a dramatic cliff, preaching his heartfelt message of eye contact. He is at home in the untamed wilderness; as gazelles prance around him, he lets his voice and perfectly tousled locks fly free. Meanwhile, two bandmates navigate a spaceship through rings of lasers in endlessly deep black space, and a fourth races a flying Delorean—what an insane idea—on virtual roads as smooth as Reggie’s voice.While it seems as though this world just couldn’t get any wackier, more challenges confront the Black Kids. They battle skull-headed demons with force fields. Their two-pronged swords of light flash against the darkness. They even manage to find a glowing volume of spells flat in the middle of the desert. Theirs is a universe where the unreal is realized. The band’s name is even seen in lights not once, not twice, but four times. In short, they “don’t care what you’ve been taught.” In this hip trip, you can live whatever Technicolor dream you like.Underlying the whole crazy experience, though, is a theme of burning love. It doesn’t matter that battles are raging and bodies are raving: “Sure I know it’s apocalypse,” Reggie sings, “but can’t it wait till I kiss your lips?” This, then, is the true takeaway: when your love life is uncertain—you’re “tired of kissing, shooting and missing”—there is only one thing to do: stop, drop, and rock. While we may not all be lucky enough to see the wonders the Black Kids have seen, at least we can all relate to this.—Antonia M.R. Peacocke

Engrained in the mind of every American kid is the myth of the life-changing summer—those three languid months between the end of childhood and the first steps into real life, a series of long days without parents or school to live wildly, fall in love, and find one’s true self. June, July, August: enough time to take a walk on the wild side, turn around, and walk back.In “The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,” written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (“Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story”) and loosely based on Michael Chabon’s debut 1988 novel of the same name, this mythic summer is distilled into 80 minutes of saccharine images and angsty declamations. Coming of age in Thurber’s colorful, melodramatic Pittsburgh is more of an unattainable ideal than an actual transformation of moral fiber. While they do their best to push the boundaries of their young existence, Thurber’s formulaic characters don’t have much to grow out of.Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) comes to his fabled summer a little late. Fresh-faced, clean-shaven, and forever dressed somewhere along the spectrum of white shirt/jeans to blue shirt/chinos, Art is a recently graduated economics major planning to work in finance in the fall. He needs adventure, and soon—lest his life become as boring as he has set it up to be. Judging from his blank stare throughout the movie, he’s already beginning to fall into his own trap (I suspect that he’s introspecting but have little proof). “If this was to be the last summer of my life, I wanted to have the least amount of responsibility possible,” Art says in a voiceover suitably devoid of emotion. Not very convincing.Adventure arrives in the form of Jane (Sienna Miller) and Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard), a couple so alluring that Art cannot help but follow them as a third wheel. Jane plays the violin brilliantly but loves punk; she’s the kind of girl who softly asks, “Do you like pie?” in an accent caught somewhere between Tennessee and the acting studio. Cleveland, her boyfriend, is the most American of young heroes—a rebel without a cause, a lost genius falling into the unstoppable maelstrom of his own reckless energy. Together Jane and Cleveland make for a sort of Abercrombie and Fitch representation of youth, their skin literally glowing under the soft gaze of cinematographer Michael Barrett’s lens. Their time together is predictable. After shifts at the Book Barn, where Art alternates between shelving books and sleeping with his conventionally unconventional supervisor, Phlox (Mena Suvari), he and the couple go on all sorts of romps. Skinny-dipping, soccer with young children, crazy nights out on the town—Thurber presses the “summer” button again and again. Hours pass lounging at the abandoned “Cloud Factory,” Thurber’s lone and treacly nod to Pittsburgh’s industrial past.But it’s not all fun with Cleve and Jane. As an antidote to the plot’s syrupiness, Thurber plops in a very vinegary element: the mob. References to the Pittsburgh gang scene run throughout the movie, just detailed enough to flash “real life danger” on the screen. In fact, while Thurber keeps the mob at a considerable distance (we don’t know, for example, why Cleveland is involved), he relies on its existence to compensate for the poorly developed elements of the flaccid plot. If Art is vapid, it is because he lives in the shadow of a gangster; a scene with a pistol juxtaposes cheerful bonding in the hope that cliché plus cliché might make some real life. Acting does not add complexity to the situation. Granted, the actors are not given much (one of Jane’s key moments repeats the word “what” eight times in about 20 seconds), but they do little to expand on the heavy-handed screenplay. Each seems to latch onto a particular physical characteristic—Art’s slightly furrowed eyebrows, Jane’s girl-next-door smile, Cleveland’s carefree gaze—as if it were the only way to access a real character. Rather than an impression of a summer, “The Mysteries of Pittsburgh” is like an impression of a summer movie. All the elements are there—love, self-exploration, and encounters with danger—and each is devoid of any interiority. To put it plainly: there’s no mystery.—Staff writer Madeleine M.

Director Kevin Macdonald’s “State of Play” is an above-average political thriller that features solid but unspectacular performances and an engaging plot that manages to hold our attention for two hours. It is better than mediocre but far from brilliant—and for this we may be thankful. After what feels like an endless procession of movies aimed at either a small critical circle or a mass market, “State of Play” accomplishes what few recent films have been able to do: balance the commercial appeal of its stars with an intelligent plot and worthy characters. At the center of the movie is Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), a seasoned reporter for The Washington Globe who begins to unravel a government conspiracy while investigating the death of a research assistant to Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck)—coincidentally Cal’s friend and college roommate. Accompanied by Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), a young but eager political blogger for The Globe, Cal discovers that at the center of the plot is PointCorp, a private company bidding for Defense Department contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan that Collins is investigating.Based on a BBC television miniseries, the film follows the basic conventions of a political thriller. Macdonald includes the obligatory love triangle as well as the requisite parking garage chase scene that we’ve seen so many times before. The movie bears a passing resemblance to other classic political thrillers such as “The Manchurian Candidate” and “The Pelican Brief,” but it still achieves a number of effective plot twists.“State of Play” does make a slight attempt to situate itself in the current political climate. Characters throw phrases around such as “privatization of homeland security,” but these references are liminal at best. The possibility of making a political statement exists but is ultimately fruitless. Rather, the real commentary in “State of Play” is about the deteriorating state of print media. “The real story is the sinking of this bloody newspaper!” Globe editor Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) yells at her reporters in one scene. The paper is failing, and Cameron is caught in the conflict between traditional journalism and new technology—a conflict embodied in Della, a blogger, and Cal, an established field reporter. While it bemoans the current crisis in print media, the movie also hearkens back to a not-so-distant past when investigative journalism had the power to change politics. It is a view that is at once sentimental, nostalgic, and not entirely unproblematic. However, it really doesn’t matter much in the context of the movie as a whole. “State of Play” seems much more concerned with keeping us intrigued than playing out a debate about new journalism.  That said, Crowe leads an impressive ensemble cast including Mirren, Affleck, McAdams, Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, and Jason Bateman. Crowe has starred in a number of thrillers, such as “Proof of Life,” “The Insider,” and last year’s “Body of Lies,” and he has become adept at playing the troubled but sympathetic antihero. Although his craggy face and shaggy hair lend his character the right air of schlubbyness, Crowe is charismatic enough to keep our attention. Mirren is feisty as Cal and Della’s boss, but her character lacks substance. As is often the case in an ensemble cast, many of the supporting actors are underutilized. Della, for instance, is not so much Cal’s partner as his sidekick, entering and exiting the film as it suits the plot. Their dialogue is often amusing, but Cal and Della lack chemistry. McAdams is almost too pretty to play Della, but she manages to hold her own against Mirren and Crowe. Bateman enters the picture late, but his performance as a slimy PR spin doctor is surprisingly sympathetic. His brief appearance constitutes the best scenes in the movie.     “State of Play” doesn’t add much to the genre of the political thriller, but it delivers entertainment that at least makes the audience think and question. It falls somewhere between the insipidness of a “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” and the painful seriousness of a “Revolutionary Road.” “State of Play” is simply smart entertainment, which seems to have become something of a rarity in Hollywood. —Staff writer Claire J.

The things that writer Bret Easton Ellis is comfortable with are not the things that most people are comfortable with: hard drugs, greed, outré sexuality, pop music, homicide, the name “Christie”—the 1980s. His novels have returned to these subjects again and again, beginning in “Less Than Zero,” continuing through his seminal work, “American Psycho,” and into a follow-up collection of short stories, “The Informers”—lately made into a somewhat uncomfortable film.Simon & Schuster, the New York publishing house, gave Ellis a huge advance on “American Psycho” after the 21-year-old author launched with “Zero” while still an undergraduate at Bennington College, and then gave him another almost as big when “Attraction” came out two years later. They balked at the finished novel, though, which sends protagonist Patrick Bateman—a 1984 graduate of Harvard College and a 1986 grad of the Business School—on a slasher rampage up and down yuppie Manhattan.Bateman is a true psychotic for sure, but he’s a guy-next-door, red-blooded-American psychotic. His mania is success, his bloodlust is greed, and his pathology is passing. There was a Patrick Bateman—levered back in his chair, feet up on the desk, Walkman blaring—in every office of every building in Lower Manhattan.Vintage eventually picked up the novel, and the rest is history. These days it’s better known for its 2000 film adaptation, starring Christian Bale as Bateman. That film spared very little in the name of delicacy; in one scene, Bateman dives under the sheets with a woman and reemerges with his maw covered in gore. In another, he axes his colleague full in the face.The film version of “The Informers” is by no means bashful, even next to “American Psycho.” A rock star chokes a whore and punches her in the face. Christie (Amber Heard) rarely wears a top. Or a bra. In just about every other area, though, there is no comparing the two. For one thing, “The Informers,” a loosely connected series of short stories, doesn’t lend itself nearly as easily to screen adaptation as “American Psycho” did. “Informers” is a four-part swansong, a requiem to that free-love-meets-free-spending materialistic innocence that represented life in early-80s L.A. as sung by a film producer, his estranged wife and mistress, a doorman and his depraved uncle, and a rock star and his addictions. The movie is bound together—as was the era—by the young, blonde, tan, wealthy children of the Zeitgeist.A fifth storyline, about a literal nightclub vampire, was excised from the film after shooting had already wrapped, an apt illustration of what makes the finished film so (forgive the pun) toothless. Ellis’s novels and the films they spawned have always stood on their psychopathology. Bateman murders his colleagues not just because he’s jealous of them, but because he actually is a homicidal maniac; the joke is that nobody notices. He’s the analog of Wall Street’s own psychosis.What better metaphor than a vampire for the Patrick Batemans of the opposite coast, literally sucking the marrow of life? Lusty consumption drives and sustains the film’s central group, led by a sensitive if shallow performance from Jon Foster as Graham, son of the producer, dealer to the rock star, and resident of the doorman’s building. Without that metaphorical structure, the film sags under its own weight. It was hard enough to take the 80s seriously while they were happening—or so I understand.The film has its technical flaws, as well. Flat camera work, underdeveloped supporting characters, and trite dialogue take the film from merely uninspired to downright unpleasant. Still, the film has its moments of insight, most of them due to its surprisingly thoughtful score of 80s pop hits. Brad Renfro, who died early last year, also delivers an affectingly damaged final performance as the doorman who manages an ultimate act of defiance against the uncle who has menaced him his entire life.A sequel to “Less Than Zero” should hit bookstores in 2010, and production has already begun on the film version of Ellis’s latest novel, the twistedly autobiographical “Lunar Park.” Neither the literary nor the Hollywood establishment is afraid of him anymore. The one has developed a taste for Ellis’s blood type, and the other has figured out how to slash his work into compliance—which is a shame. Ellis works best when he’s shocking. When he’s not, he’s as obsolete as Bateman’s Walkman. Sure, he still works, but he’s not worth it.—Staff writer Jillian J. Goodman can be reached at jjgoodm@fas.harvard.edu.

Del Toro, Iñárritu, Cuarón—Mexico has had no shortage of talented filmmakers lately. Fans of Mexican cinema may recognize that last name from 2001’s “Y tu mamá también,” which featured Carlos Cuarón as screenwriter and Alfonso Cuarón as director. Now with “Rudo y Cursi” (translated as “Rude and Corny”), younger brother Carlos makes his first attempt at directing a full-length film, a tale of fortunes won and lost in the world of Mexican soccer.       In “Y tu mamá también,” Carlos Cuarón’s screenplay paired two sexually-charged teenagers—played by Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna—on a road-trip through Mexico alongside a more mature female companion from Spain. Eight years later, “Rudo y Cursi” reunites Luna, as goalie Beto, and García Bernal, as striker Tato, in a tragicomic tale of two Mexican “campesinos” in the city’s professional soccer world. When the sports agent Batuta (Guillermo Francella) stumbles upon two spectacular soccer-playing brothers at a pick-up game, he promises them a shot at a spot on a professional squad.       With such promises of fame in Mexico’s Division I soccer leagues, Batuta unleashes the naïve farm boys into the capital city’s urban jungle. “The movie is a social portrait of Mexico today,” Cuarón said in an interview. “The people on the streets, the soccer teams… ultimately the way these guys operate is the way it is in Mexico.”       The city bears many wonders for them—free SUVs and beautiful supermodel girlfriends, among them—but it also brings a host of dangers: corruption, luxury, vices, and unsavory loan sharks.        And from the sprawling metropolis of Mexico City to the rural banana-farming communities of the state of Oaxaca, the movie depicts Mexico in a variety of contrasting locales. One great challenge was to film the final soccer match, which is played out in Estadio Nemesio Díez, an old stadium in Toluca, Mexico.       “We obviously have a plan, and we had a schedule, but we had to improvise,” Cuarón said. The shooting faced both heavy rains and sweltering summer heat. “Every single day we had to improvise something. We all had a lot of fun doing it.”      One of the film’s most memorable moments is the corny but endearing opening tune. The audience is greeted by García Bernal’s character, Tato, crooning a Spanish cover of Cheap Trick’s “I Want You to Want Me,” complete with an accordion and cowboy outfit against a karaoke green screen. “I read through the script, and I came to a point that [Tato] wasn’t working,” Cuarón said. The script went through multiple revisions to give Tato a more comical desire to use soccer to fuel his fantasies of a successful  musical career.      “His secondary passion is his real passion,” Cuarón explained. “He has a talent for soccer but a passion for singing, and that is the problem.”      “I knew I needed a rock and roll hit for this character,” he added.     One unexpected result of the movie’s release is the popularity of García Bernal’s Spanish-language cover of Cheap Trick’s song, entitled “Quiero Que Me Quieras.” The song has gone on to become a hit in radios and karaoke bars in Mexico. According to Cuarón, the song choice was improvised.      “One day I was driving my kids to school,” he recalled. The song then struck his ear from the car radio. “At the end of the first stanza I was like, ‘This is it!’” he says. “If someone sings ‘I Want You to Want Me,’ they have an attention problem. That is the character.”      With “Rudo y Cursi”—which is slated for limited release in the United States on May 8th—Cuarón hopes to show the multiple layers of Mexican society through the bond between Beto and Tato.“Ultimately, the main theme of this movie is brotherhood, and I think American audiences will relate to this,” he said. “Nothing is as endearing as brotherhood.” —Staff writer Alec E.

An infidelity here, a dash of marijuana there—the suburban Eden post-apple is a common enough story. Film, especially, is a repeat offender of this fixation on suburbia’s trouble in paradise; “Revolutionary Road,” “The Stepford Wives,” and “American Beauty,” for example, are a few of the many films that deal with the farce of suburban bliss. Director Derick Martini’s latest dramedy, “Lymelife,” is another, but it strips that jaded quality which clings to others of the genre. What is most impressive about “Lymelife” is its ability to distinguish itself from the legacy of the flawed-suburbia film and create something wholly new.A film developed by the Sundance Institute, “Lymelife” is the directorial debut of Derick Martini. In it, Martini presents a peeled portrait of suburban life on Long Island. The film follows Scott Bartlett (Rory Culkin), a soft-spoken high school student who is incurably in love with his neighbor’s daughter, Adrianna Bragg (Emma Roberts). But this budding romance blossoms into a story of familial intrigue and the eventual disintegration of both families.  Scott’s father, Mickey (Alec Baldwin), owns a lucrative housing development business and has hired Adrianna’s mother (Cynthia Nixon) to enable their affair. Numbly observing their liaison is Adrianna’s father (Timothy Hutton), who is physically consumed and financially impotent because of Lyme disease, a consequence of his penchant for hunting. Meanwhile, Scott’s mother (Jill Hennessy) longs for her former life in Queens as she tries to overlook her struggling marriage. Finally, the catalyst of much of the film’s action is the return of Scott’s older brother, Jimmy (Kieran Culkin), from the army. “Lymelife” marches to its own idiosyncratic, internal rhythm—both figuratively and literally, as Steve Martini, the director’s brother, scored the film. In the opening scene, the quick cross-cuts between shots of live-action and shots of a housing development model match the beats and thumps of the music. The sounds, however, are only a part of the film’s internal pulse. Each character’s arc acts as a sonata to the film’s whole, and scenes are explosive not because of physical action but rather because of latent energy. “Lymelife” is a dark satire, like “Little Miss Sunshine,” and its power draws from irony and moments of veracity.Despite the film’s reliance on clichéd movie gimmicks—an angsty adolescent romance, one parent’s infidelity, and a father-son antagonism—the emotional violence in “Lymelife” is strikingly affecting. No words are left unsaid, and no character is immune to the plague that is suburbia. Rather, the film takes the old story of trouble in suburbia and twists the melodrama into something fresh, molding family dynamics into moments of poignancy. Jimmy’s tipping point, for example, presents an unfiltered picture of psychological unravel that sits starkly in the trail of the film’s ruthless emotional episodes.For the most part, the cast is flawless in performance. It may be difficult for some to imagine Alec Baldwin as anyone other than Jack Donaghy from “30 Rock”; nevertheless, his delivery is impeccable, and he transforms his flawed character into a sympathetic one. Jill Hennessy also offers a thoughtful performance, teasing out complications of motherhood and dignity. However, unlike Baldwin and Hennessy, Roberts is the exception to the rule. A relative newcomer to the big screen, her performance is stilted, insincere, and self-conscious. Fortunately, the other actors pick up her slack to convey the film’s grit and realism.It is certainly a daunting task for any director—let alone a first-time director—to reframe suburbia. In “Lymelife,” Derick Martini not only reframes it but also commendably reconstructs it as a plasticized, broken Eden. Sitting complacently at her desk, Mrs. Bragg exclaims in the film, “It’s the American dream, right? You’re on Long Island!” Perhaps the answer to her rhetorical question, however, is best conveyed by the gunshot that draws the film to a close.

For a movie with such a title, “Gigantic” is rather understated. The name calls forth visions of epic battles or heroic sacrifices, but “Gigantic” is rather the story of a budding romance that shimmers in its details—like the first chewy taste of goat stew or the unceremonious clank of earrings dropped straight onto floor tiles. The film is frank, unassuming, and gently witty. In a soft and steady voice, it speaks volumes about the power of chance in finding love.The movie begins when the obnoxious Al Lolly (John Goodman) purchases a $14,000 Swedish mattress in the warehouse where shy 28-year-old Brian Weathersby (Paul Dano, “There Will Be Blood”) works as a salesman. Later in the day, his airy daughter “Happy” (Zooey Deschanel, “Yes Man”)—a girl with expensive fashion taste and no inhibitions—arrives at the store with no other intention than to nap for three hours on his newly purchased bed.It is already apparent by the time Brian covers the girl with a blanket and gingerly removes the plastic demonstration skeleton from her side that something will happen between the two of them. What is not expected is that the obvious tension will be broken just the next day by Happy’s frank question: “Do you have any interest in having sex with me?”The film’s greatest strength is its ability to invest the everyday with humor. Brian’s life before meeting Happy is one of limited scope. His job, as he describes it, involves selling less than 10 mattresses a month; his social life consists entirely of family dinners with his sleepy 80-year-old father and visits to his friend Larry’s (Brian Avers) psychological laboratory.But this focus on the mundane never detracts from the movie’s charm. Luminous details—like Brian’s earnest attempts to adopt a Chinese baby despite his young bachelorhood, and Larry’s inexplicable penchant for mixing purple vodka with pure ethanol while on the job—give each character an idiosyncratic tint. The debut script from Adam Nagata and director Matt Aselton is fresh and quirky; the dialogue alone could drive the awkward humor of the piece even without the nuanced talent of Dano and Deschanel.Furthermore, the film manages to focus on these quirks without overdoing them as indie flicks often do. The silly surface of the film is upheld by beautiful cinematography and careful music choices. A few shots in particular stand out: one at the very start of the film, a view of lower Manhattan ironically dwarfing the movie’s title against the skyscrapers, and later a panorama of a shadowed indoor pool that silhouettes Brian and Happy against a stark white wall. The music, which ranges from instrumental flittings to Masta Killa’s “Brooklyn King,” is wisely used to accent moods rather than to set them.The real intrigue of the movie, however, comes in its veiled imagery and unanswered questions. The movie begins, for example, with a shot of two white rats struggling to keep from drowning. As they bat their tiny pink paws against the glass sides of a lab tank, Larry explains his observation that anti-depressants make the rats less likely to give up. Over the course of the film, Brian also finds himself striving more and more to keep his head above water, so to speak, as he begins to overcome the bizarre hurdles thrown his way. In one example of such a task, Brian finds himself carting the obese Mr. Lolly back and forth from the chiropractor. On the ride, Happy’s father makes a point about the interplay of chance and control in health and happiness. Speaking of a brain tumor he experienced, he takes full credit for ridding himself of cancer: “I mapped the pathology of the cancer with my mind—very Chinese. Then I moved it.” The film’s absurdity is perfectly exemplified in the scene that follows: a shot of Mr. Lolly coughing up a brownish-orange tumor in his bathroom. Likewise, the unidentified and aimlessly violent homeless man who chases Brian throughout much of the movie seems to be more a metaphor for Brian’s demons of insecurity than any real person.The film thus touches on a kind of magical realism in dealing with chance and control—and perhaps, for the success of the ending, it is best that it does. The conscious rejection of pure realism serves to de-emphasize the role of the filmmakers, just as Happy’s entrance into Brian’s life threatens his control of his own fate. What is gigantic in the film, then, is simply the accumulation of moments that somehow amount to a turnaround for Brian; the title magnifies the importance of each minute battle won in everyday life.

When a movie’s trailer makes big promises, the film itself rarely measures up to expectations. Billed as an emotionally soaring saga based on the true story of “a lost dream, an unlikely friendship, and the redemptive power of music,” “The Soloist” tries hard to take our emotions for a ride but never quite leaves the ground. Though the performances are convincing and compelling, the movie is weighed down by its insistence on subordinating both music and personal narrative to a broader social message. The story of Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) has ample potential to be poignant and transformative. A man whose early talent for the cello propelled him to The Juilliard School and boundless opportunity, somewhere along that journey he lost himself. The movie never gives sufficient evidence as to why or how, but when we first see him, he’s living homeless and schizophrenic in the tunnels and streets of Los Angeles. Enter Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.), an eccentric, popular Los Angeles Times columnist who, despite his professional success, seems to be barely keeping it together. He goes flying over his bike on the way to work, accidentally sprays a bag of coyote urine in his face as he cleans his backyard, and works with his snarky ex-wife (Catherine Keener). With this, the movie constructs the seemingly perfect set-up for an unlikely friendship between two men who desperately need comebacks.Lopez conveniently runs into Ayers on the street, and, fascinated, pens a series of columns about the experience. Later in the film, he brings Ayers to live in the LAMP Community for the homeless, and it is here that the film is most compelling but also most misguided. The portrayal of the plight of L.A.’s homeless is straightforward, unapologetic, and sometimes violent. The transcendent beauty of Beethoven’s music—Ayers’ favorite—clashes constantly with the images of the desperate and abandoned vagabonds, and the conflict is intentional and incisive. But the heavy emphasis on this political undercurrent of urban suffering detracts from what should be the focus of the film: Ayers’ personal struggle to find redemption through music. Director Joe Wright (“Atonement”) makes Lopez’s intentions toward Ayers clear: “I met a man who was down on his luck and I thought I could help him.” But this motive bears little in the way of transformation or even explanation. The 1996 movie “Shine,” whose plot is almost identical to that of “The Soloist,” traced the struggles and recovery of pianist David Helfgott to a provocative and satisfying resolution. Unlike that movie, however, “The Soloist” never answers the question it first posited: can music and human care provide the courage to reclaim what’s been lost? This does not take away from the genuine nature of the film’s performances. After an Oscar-winning portrayal of musical genius Ray Charles in 2004, Foxx does not disappoint with his take on the remarkably idiosyncratic, capricious, and conflicted musician Ayers. Robert Downey Jr. has a much less dramatic character to work with, but he manages to spin Lopez into a quirky, not completely selfless version of the quixotic hero. The problem lies not in the dynamic between the two men but rather in the seemingly arbitrary twists and turns of the plot. The film’s end carries no sign of redemption, little trace of failure, and a wealth of ambiguity. This outcome makes it difficult to view the film as either a commercially successful blockbuster or an intelligent social commentary. “I’ve never loved anything as much as that man loves music,” Lopez says of Ayers, but the movie never actualizes that sentiment.

Malcolm G. Campbell ’10 and his brother Graham were playing the piano in Quincy one day when a friend walked in. “It was so eye-opening for him to see my brother and me making music together,” Malcolm says. Graham, who is diagnosed with Down Syndrome, has been playing piano since childhood. This Sunday, he and Malcolm will both perform in the Down Syndrome Awareness Seminar and Concert, which will take place in the Adams House Lower Common Room.The event, which celebrates the passions and talents of individuals with Down Syndrome, will feature Campbell, who is a jazz pianist, as well as his brother Graham and Katharine Breunig, who also has Down Syndrome. Graham Campbell, now 22, has been playing piano since the age of 8. He also arranges popular music. According to Malcolm, his brother demonstrates an insatiable passion for music. “[Graham] has amazing concentration and discipline... he would always practice more than me,” he says.Both Graham and Malcolm studied under the same piano teacher, Sayuri Miyamoto, for 10 years. According to Malcolm, the aptitude Graham has shown for piano playing has been immensely fulfilling for him. “[Graham] has a lot of confidence and pride in what he’s doing,” Malcolm says. Graham, a senior studying piano at Berkshire Hills Music Academy, had a “You’re at college; well, I’m at college too” attitude about visiting his brother at Harvard.This Sunday’s concert will feature the Campbell brothers, who will play a few interpretations of songs from “The Little Mermaid,” “Sleeping Beauty,” and the musical, “My Fair Lady.” Graham’s performance, as well as that of his classmate Katharine, emphasizes that individuals with Down Syndrome can be independent. “We really believe a lot in self-advocacy and not just having [individuals with Down Syndrome] be a passive part of the event,” Malcolm says. Together with two other individuals with Down Syndrome, Katharine and Graham will form a panel to discuss what life with the disorder is like.The Down Syndrome Awareness Seminar and Concert is intended as both an educational and uplifting event. “For people who are familiar with Down Syndrome, and for people who are completely unfamiliar,” Malcolm says, “[the concert] will open their eyes to people who are doing well and have really rich lives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Out of the ash I rise with my red hair, and I eat men like air.” Sylvia Plath’s strong voice projects from a black rectangular machine resting on a table. A dozen people sit in surrounding blue chairs, listening attentively. Some hold anthologies of Sylvia Plath’s poetry and follow along with the poet’s recorded voice. Others merely listen. On Friday afternoons in the George Edward Woodberry Poetry Room in Lamont Library, visitors gather to appreciate the recordings of prominent poets as part of REEL TIME, one of the new programs recently installed under the direction of new curator Christina S. Davis.Since Davis arrived at Harvard in October, she has made efforts to share the famous, albeit a bit dusty, audio archives to which the Poetry Room lays claim. Boasting the voices of John Ashbery, Robert Frost, Vladimir Nabokov, and Ezra Pound, the Harvard collection of audio recordings is one of the most extensive in the nation. Through Davis’ new programs, the collection has become more accessible not only to the Harvard community but to the public as well.“I wanted poetry to have its majesty but also to have personable, intimate forums,” Davis says.During the past seven months, Davis has implemented three daytime programs in the Poetry Room. In addition to REEL TIME, a weekly listening hour that features audio recordings of poetry from the 20th and 21st centuries, there is IMPROMPTU POETICS, which invites guest poets to recording sessions in the Poetry Room, which are also open to the public. Lastly, Woodberry Works-in-Progress allows scholars and artists to speak with attendees about  projects that are in their nascent stages.“Seeing someone immersed in the outset of an idea, when the yesses and nos remain unsplit in it, humanizes it and allows us admittance,” Davis says about Works-in-Progress. She hopes that by having the opportunity to give feedback to these artists, students will feel as if they have influenced the works presented. Past projects discussed at Works-in-Progress include found poetry and the creation of the largest onsound poetry archive.These programs have received praise from the Harvard community. Professor Peter M. Sacks, who teaches 20th-Century American Poetry, says the events have given his students the opportunity to immerse themselves in poetry through the real voices of their authors.“There’s a welcoming range of taste, of emotion, of spirit,” Sacks says of the Poetry Room programs. “A genuine feeling of enterprise, of both adventure and devotion. There’s a living connection between the archive and the as-yet-unrecorded.”On May 8, another program will be introduced to the Poetry Room. The Oral History Initiative is intended to allow visitors to be exposed to the nonacademic aspects of the poets they study. The first episode, “Three Friends of Robert Lowell,” will offer friends of the writer a chance to share personal anecdotes about him.According to Davis, the events at the Poetry Room have attracted diverse crowds. Spanning class years, generations, concentrations, and involvement in the Harvard community, attendees of the programs vary in their experience with, and exposure to, poetry. Davis says that the various individuals who visit the Poetry Room often strike up friendships after attending events. “Poetry is an inherently synthesizing art form,” she says.In addition to being a social catalyst, poetry, according to Davis, is especially important in a university setting where students are taught specific methods of thinking.“Poetry is a permanent place for questions to reside, free of all the answers we receive,” she says. “It is a mode of thought that allows us to become reunited with a more essential way of thinking.”—Staff writer Anita B.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the senior thesis that people will actually see, even if for the first time at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,” written and directed by Damien S. Chazelle ’07-’08, is his first feature-length film. Chazelle originally conceived the movie on a considerably smaller scale but expanded the project after receiving an Artist Development Fellowship (ADF) in 2007.“Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench” was primarily shot and produced in the Boston area. With a conventional script, the black-and-white movie pays homage to the timeless formula of an old Hollywood musical and romance set against a backdrop of a roaring jazz scene. Yet Chazelle reinterprets the genre by filming the movie with an unorthodox, and often labor-intensive, technique.“I tried to approach the genre of the musical in a documentary way by using the lives of people as the framework of the film,” Chazelle says. “This involved following the actors in real life and a lot of improvisation.”Receiving the ADF gave Chazelle the opportunity to jumpstart his creative career in the professional industry. His film will be one of 14 entries competing in the Tribeca Film Festival’s Discovery section, a category that features the innovative works of up-and-coming filmmakers. “I feel great about the final product,” he says. “But it was essentially a lucky stroke that my film will be shown at the festival because it doesn’t have any big names or a large budget.”“Without the fellowship, the film would never have gone off the ground at all,” Chazelle explains. “Basically, it was the launching pad for the project, and it gave me the chance to make the film I wanted to make.” Initiated in conjunction with the Office for the Arts at Harvard (OFA) and the Office of Career Services (OCS), the ADF program recognizes students with extraordinary artistic promise and provides them with grants to help foster their development. The ADF, which is moderated by committee members of the Council on the Arts, is awarded to 12-15 students who represent a wide range of disciplines.“We want the opportunity to be life-changing,” says Jack C. Megan, OFA Director and the chair of the Council on the Arts. “Ten years from now, we hope that some of these people will be accomplished artists and that they see this investment as the turning point.”From Megan’s perspective, Chazelle’s accomplishments bode well for the relatively new ADF program, as his success legitimizes the effect the grants could have on the future of talented student artists.“Is Damien’s project at the Tribeca Film Festival because of the fellowship? Not exactly,” Megan says. “But did we give him a boost? I think we did.”Chazelle admits, however, that even with ADF funding, his limited resources presented one of the greatest obstacles to the production process. He and his team had to account for expenses, including the high costs of film stock.“As a young filmmaker, you wind up learning how to be resourceful. We had to fundraise every step of the way and rely on the generosity of others,” he says. “But that process gave us the opportunity to step back and really think about what we were doing.”Still, Chazelle is far from finished with the promotion of his first work. “My ambitions with this movie don’t end with the festival,” he says. “I still want to get the film out there and give it as much life as I can.”In addition, Chazelle says, “Guy and Madeline” acts as the stepping-stone for future projects, whether they are low-budget or Hollywood production. “I’d like to ideally do both because I don’t really see them as being mutually exclusive,” Chazelle says. “My interests in movies are varied, so I just want to make as many good movies as I can.”—Staff writer Eunice Y.

For the first time in 15 years, a student-written play is premiering on the Loeb Mainstage. This honor has opened artistic possibilities for the producers, actors, and all others involved. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “The Space Between” will use the space to produce an experimental play combining theatrics, dance, and, less likely, physics.Catherine “Calla” Videt ’09, playwright and director of the play, who could not be reached for comment, wrote the work as the second half of her thesis for her Special Concentration in Theatre and Physics. She started developing the project as a freshman, inspired by the beauty of physics. Videt, along with Ilinca Radulian ’10, applied to produce the play with HRDC last semester, and they were granted the second Loeb Mainstage slot of the spring season.“The Space Between” is an exploration of how to make theoretical physics manifest on stage. Inspired by the late Samuel Beckett, the play lacks a traditional form. Instead, it is divided into the intertwining stories of different couples who act almost as analogous pairs. The principle couple is Richard Feynman, the Caltech physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb, and his wife, who in this play is called Eurydice. Both are dying and reflecting on their youth. Another story involves a Biblical Adam and Eve, echoed by a modern Adam, a painter, and Eve, his lover and one of Feynman’s students. The final thread involves the mythical Orpheus and Eurydice. Through these couples, the play expresses the laws of physics and the intangible, dual themes of death and passionate love. As the play progresses, the characters move in and out of reality.These stories act as explanations for the theories of physics, including wave-particle duality. “The theme of seeing, of turning back to see, of interrogating the past for answers keeps coming back through the play,” Radulian wrote in an email. “The physical concept of collapsing the wave function through observation is paralleled with the Orpheus story. If you don’t look, both choices are still possible; ‘yes’ and ‘no’ exist and are valid at the same time. If you look, one of the possibilities vanishes. This is an accessible explanation of the physical concept, which the Orpheus myth follows entirely.”Executive producer Kevin J. Davies ’10 agreed that the play celebrates the beauty of physical laws. “[‘The Space Between’] began as an exploration of what staging physics would be like through dancing, [and] sound video,” Davies says. “It’s about taking an equation that you can write on a wall and making it into something that you can hear and see and even sometimes touch.”In order to realize this goal, the play incorporates many forms of media, such as video, trapeze, and dance. “It’s also an incredibly beautiful show. There’s trapeze, video… it’s very lush,” Jesse W. Barron ’09, who plays Richard Feynman in the show. “It’s very multimedia and all about possibility.”The production staff of “The Space Between” have all influenced the energy and direction of the play and taken the opportunity to experiment with and explore the possibilities being on the American Repertory Theater’s Mainstage provides. As such, the production has taken on a collaborative dimension, with the experienced production staff adding their own creative vision to Videt’s text. The result is in an organic, malleable, multifaceted whole that represents the artistic visions of a group, not one individual.    “Most plays start from the text and build from that. They extrapolate from something that’s really defined and set,” Davies says. “Because with this show there wasn’t an original structure, we’ve been able to edit and refine as the show evolves.”The production has evolved in a manner similar to the theories and lovers it incorporates and describes. The final product will run on the Loeb Mainstage today through May 2nd.

“Sixteen Candles.” “Pretty in Pink.” “Mean Girls.” There are many interpretations of high school life. For whatever reason, though, most stories about college tend to be full of one-sided, hard-partying characters. Zoe R.N. Sarnak ’09, writer and composer of new musical “The Quad”—which opened in the Loeb Ex last night and will run until this Saturday—has taken it upon herself to rectify this one-sidedness. “We still have three dimensions. We aren’t all in Animal House,” Sarnak says. “The Quad” looks to prove this by taking a deeper look at both the seriousness and the silliness that is college.Sarnak has always been interested in stories that juxtapose extreme positive and negative emotions. With “The Quad,” she hopes to present all of the highs and lows of college, not just the stereotypes of frat life. At the same time, the show acknowledges that beer pong and drunken hook ups are a part of college life, and includes them, often to humorous effect. “It would be silly not to pick up on the light aspects,” Sarnak says. The Quad that the musical’s title refers to is not the Radcliffe Quadrangle. Rather, it is the four main female leads that the musical tracks from their freshman (Act I) to senior (Act II) years. Along the way, they discover sketchy parties, the “Walk of Shame”, and, eventually, themselves. Although the musical is not set specifically at Harvard, it bears such hallmark phrases of the alma mater as “TF” and “Freshman Week.” But “The Quad” also tackles serious issues like anorexia and the death of a loved one, something that Sarkin says keeps the musical from “becoming ‘High School Musical Goes to College.’” Director Jordan A. Reddout ’10 says that when given the choice between realistic and campy, she tried to stick to a realistic portrayal of college life. At the same time, scenes like a freshman girl trying to strike a pose leaning on a beer pong table while an experienced (and sleazy) sophomore woos her with his guitar are downright silly and provide comic relief.Sarnak has been writing songs since middle school and loves musical theater. However, being a Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator and a member of the soccer team for her first two years at Harvard, she hadn’t been able to make much time to get involved in theater. A self-proclaimed “theater outsider,” Sarnak had never even seen a theater production at Harvard before she starting writing this musical in the summer before her senior year.Working in a lab her sophomore year, Sarnak would set up experiments and then run next store to play the piano. The musical started with a song, which Sarnak then built a character around. Then came more songs, and more characters, and a storyline started to develop. But Sarnak was only beginning to see that she could do something more with her passion for writing songs. In her junior year she finally enrolled in music classes, which made her feel capable of starting a larger project. Being such a newcomer to Harvard theater, Sarnak wasn’t sure how she would stage what she had or even if she wanted to stage it at Harvard. Molly D. Swenson ’10, who plays Kelsey, convinced her to contact Reddout and try to stage the musical. The resulting production calls for college students to play college students, which allows for a greater overlap of fiction and reality than most plays. “We cast people who were already sort of their characters,” Reddout says. Because the script was a work in progress, the actors had the chance to make the parts their own. “Everyone has had a lot of agency in creating who they are,” Swenson says. “The actors made the show a lot funnier than it was intended to be.”With funding from the Office for the Arts, the show was able to bring in people such as producer, director, and screenwriter Larry Cohen to help develop the show. Casting was done in February, and the show held a workshop in March, to provide audience insight into the show, a rare step for Harvard shows to take.All of the actors except for two are involved in a cappella, giving the show a very strong vocal background. But such a heavy focus on music and singing abilities is little surprise given that Sarkin is primarily a songwriter, and that the musical evolved from one of her songs.While only a year ago Sarnak wouldn’t even play a song for someone, next week she’ll be playing the piano as a full cast performs a musical she wrote and composed. As the characters in “The Quad” find their place, Sarnak says she’s finally found hers as well. After all the things she’s tried at Harvard, Sarnak says, “I’ve found what I want to do.”

Dance is an art of the human body. It exposes emotions through physical manifestations, and choreography uses the rich lexicon of body language. It seems, then, that any choreographer looking to stretch the limits of corporeal expression would require performers with incredible versatility and training. But choreographers’ avid searches for such rare ability inevitably overlook one fascinating factor in human movement: disability.Heidi F. Latsky acknowledged this oversight. Previously a dancer for Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance and now a member of the Hofstra University faculty, she recently choreographed a performance featuring eight dancers, four of whom live with disabilities. Her creation—which is coming to Boston’s Institute of Contemporary Art tonight and tomorrow—is called the GIMP project, and its name perfectly exemplifies her bold and unabashed intention to honor the different ways in which the disabled move. In fact, the project’s website points out certain different meanings for the word “gimp,” including “a ribbon like, braided fabric… fighting spirit; vigor…[and] to turn, vacillate, tremble ecstatically.” Her motive is not political, but by highlighting the new beauty of disabled body types she transforms her audience’s perception of disabilities entirely. “It started off as just really exploring with different body types and how they moved together, and how they moved in really unique ways, and each person’s unique virtuosity,” Latsky says. More than anything else, she and her ensemble seek to celebrate beauty in dancers that differ from the norm. The show’s producer, Jeremy Alliger, commented that this “unique virtuosity” of disability let the choreographer explore original forms of expression. “Imagine a master Renaissance painter, for instance, who discovers a new color on his palette that never before existed,” Alliger says. “And imagine the excitement, and the new possibilities that open up to him.” GIMP explores the magnificence of these unconventional movements.Latsky uses the unappreciated aesthetics of these moves to explore a range of moods. “There is humor in it,” she says. “Some of the sections are kind of more confrontational. A lot of them are very internal.” The music accompanying the pieces ranges appropriately from popular music to opera arias. Some of the musical compositions are original, and one part of the show is accompanied by nothing but the breath of jazz singer, saxophonist, and flautist Stan Strickland. Even the stage does not constrict the choreographer’s vision; she sets an aerial number—or, as she puts it, a “movement portrait”—in the open air. Certain unifying factors, however, hold the entire show together. “There’s a very strong sense of sensuality and some sexuality throughout,” Latsky says.Within this artistic exploration, GIMP does play with its audience’s social attitudes towards disability. The exposure of disabled physicality on stage intentionally goes against the grain for audience members. “Children are always seen being told by parents not to stare,” Alliger says. But placing the disabled on stage in a celebratory way invites the audience to form a more nuanced understanding of disabled movement. “They’re given the permission to stare,” Alliger says of the audience. And to complete the rapport, the performers stare right back; at one point they break from dancing in order to address the audience directly with quotations from previous audiences’ reactions, including “We’ve been watching you. We think you’re beautiful.” Thus GIMP blurs the line between the watched and the watchers, and the audience manages to experience new perceptions of new physicalities.For one dancer in the ensemble, this change in perception is one of the most important elements of GIMP. Lawrence Carter-Long lives with cerebral palsy, a neuromuscular disorder that affects his control of his legs. He also works as the Director of Advocacy for the Disabilities Network of NYC.“Within the culture we’re in, specifically, disability is something to be cured; it’s something to be frightened of,” he says. Similarly, the disabled are relegated to a mental world and rarely given the opportunity to express themselves corporeally. “People learn to work with you from the neck up,” he explains. But the dance project complicates personal attitudes towards disability in vital ways; instead of praising the efforts of GIMP’s cast in hackneyed ways, calling them inspirational or courageous, the audience is meant to recognize that different movements deserve celebration for their beauty.

Harvard has no fewer than three art museums, two Gutenberg Bibles, and 13 million volumes in its library system. But, in spite of all this, it has yet to acquire the one thing that many undergraduates would most wish to see—a student center. In fact, what might be the closest thing the campus has to such a venue—Lamont Café—is located in a library. Therefore, in its prospective plans to investigate a purchase of 45 Mt. Auburn Street—the building that formerly housed the Democracy Center—the Undergraduate Council makes a noble attempt to address the important problem of social space at Harvard. Yet purchasing 45 Mt. Auburn may not present the solution that the Council hopes. 
If the UC owned 45 Mt. Auburn, the impacts for students and the university community as a whole no doubt would be positive: Harvard would finally have a venue (albeit a small one) that could serve as an official social space for students. But, by the same token, these benefits would be small, especially given the space constraints—there are approximately 6,000 undergraduates at the College and room for only a few hundred in the Mt. Auburn Street property. Also, there is the thorny issue of the UC’s ties to the administration and the potential impact this would have on alcohol policy. Since the UC’s budget derives largely from termbill fees, it might not be able to provide the venue many students imagine when they picture the ideal social space at Harvard. In other words, 45 Mt. Auburn Street would most likely fail to solve the social-space problem. 
It is also seems somewhat unrealistic for the UC to raise the necessary amount of money in the proposed time frame—a daunting $600,000 by September, followed by several million over an extended period of time—especially given the current economic climate. We therefore do not recommend that the UC pursue the purchase of 45 Mt. Auburn Street, as the plan is unlikely to be successful and may detract from other valuable goals and projects. 
Efforts to solve the social space problem at Harvard are admirable and important. But this particular initiative may not be something worth pursuing. And, while the social space problem will persist, we hope that the UC tries to find other solutions in the future.

The Undergraduate Council has come up with an innovative, bold proposal, and, ironically, it may fail because it is the UC that has come up with it. This week the student governing body will vote on whether to initiate a capital campaign to raise $600,000 to put toward a down payment on 45 Mt. Auburn Street—the Democracy Center building, currently owned by the Foundation for Civic Leadership. Supporters of the undertaking provide a vision that this building could become a vibrant communal social space (read: party space) for the Harvard student body.
As of now, it is uncertain how the UC will undertake the massive fundraising effort needed to purchase the building or how they will negotiate the legalities of hosting open parties. Nevertheless, the prospect of a social space for the whole student body is extremely alluring. By providing a venue for any club or organization to have a decent party, it would open up social opportunities for the fair number of students who are currently underserved by the going options. For this reason, the UC should go forward with plans to buy 45 Mount Auburn Street.
As any student, alum, or college guidebook will tell you, the Harvard social scene is dismal compared to other universities. Although part of this is because students generally prioritize partying less, another reason is that many organizations that want to hold big functions just don’t have the space. These groups, which serve as valuable networks during the day, are handicapped from exercising their full social potential by their impotency at night. Students are not lacking in initiative, as evidenced by the popularity of the Cambridge Adult Learning Center as a venue for club events at the beginning of this year—that is, before the Cambridge License Commission caught on. If the UC owned 45 Mt. Auburn Street, every organization would have an equal, easy, and affordable opportunity to hold events. At a capacity of around 200, operating about 24 weekends over two terms, this building could serve a diverse range of student groups throughout the year.
Additionally, the mere presence of such a student government-owned communal space would be an equalizing factor on the social scene. It would place the onus on having a fun Saturday night on individual students. Right now, it is far too easy to sit back and complain that final clubs have taken over the social scene, with their large dancing spaces and ample room for coats. Having a student- administered building would put a degree of social autonomy into the hands of any single undergraduate and might lessen the victimized tone of the social opportunities-discussion.
Admittedly, as wonderful as this idea is, doubts about the UC’s ability to execute it are valid. Raising $600,000 over the summer to put a down payment on 45 Mt. Auburn will be extraordinarily difficult. The UC is not famed for its efficiency or organizational prowess, and it would really have to step up its game to make this project a success. Nevertheless, we are the last who should underestimate the capacity of our peers and the Harvard network. Moreover, centrally situated Cambridge real estate does not come on the market every year, and this opportunity is too favorable to let slip by with a characteristic “It’s the UC” eye roll. This weekend, hundreds of prefrosh will descend on campus, and, when they broach the subject of our graveyard social reputation, we can at least tell them that we’re making an honest effort to improve.

One of my friends recently called me to talk about the exciting Red Sox season ahead. He goes to BU and, like any proud Boston fan, was excited about the baseball games coming up. I, however, was very disappointed. Why, you might wonder? Because my friend and I went to the same Chicago-area high school, where for the decade we lived in the area we both cheered for the Bulls, the Bears, the Cubs, and other area teams. His switch in allegiances upon moving east struck me as overly convenient, even disloyal. I didn’t say it on the phone then, but I would now—when coming to an out-of-state college, it is crucial to stay true to one’s hometown sporting allegiances, backing the teams that have defined a childhood.
Cheering for a sports team allows one to develop a tangible and powerful connection to a home city. When Bears fans throw their support behind the gritty, tough, and understated ethic of the football team, they are also connecting to the modest, hard-working, and unassuming culture of Chicago. When Patriots fans cheer for the flashy, loud, and sign-stealing antics of their football team, they are attaching themselves to a certain Boston mores as well. Teams reflect the personalities of their cities and fans; lifelong allegiance to a team is an important facet of identifying with one’s hometown.
Just as importantly, the sports teams we grew up with have given us some of the best experiences of our childhoods. Every sports fan remembers crying and cheering over losses and victories and immortalizing his or her athletic heroes. During spring training, students in the high school cafeteria would speak excitedly of a hopeful new year and look forward to missing school days in April and May to attend baseball games with their dads. During the winter, looking forward to Sunday football games was one of the few reprieves from the cold, dreary, snowy, and generally depressing weather. Every kid who lived in Chicago during the 1990s knew that their career of choice was to be Michael Jordan and also knew, for better or worse, that the Cubs’ annual late season collapse was an essential part of the calendar year. After home teams have given us so many memorable childhood experiences, they deserve lifelong fans, supporters who will come to their defense in any city, in any game, at any time.
Next time you watch a series between your hometown team and a Boston team, you may be tempted to join in cheering alongside the hordes of loud Boston fans watching with you. But resist the urge to simply hop on the bandwagon. Root for your true home team, keeping in mind the connections your team built between you and your hometown and the experiences and joys that it gave you throughout your childhood. As I watch the Bulls play the Celtics this week, win or lose, I’ll sleep soundly knowing I haven’t sold my soul; I’m rooting for the home team.

So you’re here for prefrosh weekend. Someone just handed you this Crimson on your way to one of eight ice-cream socials where you have patiently asked  “Where are you from?” “What are you thinking of concentrating in?” “Do you think you will come here?” 78 times. The weather is rumored to be 70 degrees, but 70 degrees in Cambridge somehow translates to what you perceive as 50. It’s cloudy. At the 80s dance you are about to attend, you will notice how many Harvard students are so pale that they actually glow under a blacklight. All this is very disconcerting. On your ride over on the plane, you sat between some kid with a BlackBerry who wanted to compare the opportunities for junior politicians at Harvard and Brown and a girl wearing six scarves who wanted to tell you about all the high-school theater shows she had revitalized with her post-Foucaultian directing style. You are just a normal person. It comes out in the course of conversation that you don’t even play the violin.  
The one class you decided to attend —“Logic and Number Theory”—turned out to be on the second floor of something called Sever and have a total of three students. You have no idea why this was on the list, because the professor speaks in a nervous, high-pitched whisper and is talking about “Well-Orderings.” You have no idea what these are. You tried taking notes for about six minutes before giving up and spending the remainder of the time nodding significantly at appropriate intervals. When you got up to leave after 30 minutes, the professor stared beseechingly after you with  big, sad eyes, as though you were betraying him.  
Six of your past seven meals have been ice-cream socials, but the one that wasn’t you ate in Kirkland. It consisted of something called scrod, and you had no idea what it was or why they put that sauce on it.  Some people told you that this was a Boston specialty, but they didn’t sound entirely convinced. This made you think about going into Boston, but the signs on the T pointing towards vague concepts like “Alewife” and “Braintree” sounded too ominous.  
You saw “Legally Blonde,” so you know that Harvard is full of snobby brunettes and men who roll out of bed every morning fully dressed in suits and ties. You also may have seen “Love Story,” so you know that, even in a movie about passionate romance between Harvard students, they somehow thought it was necessary for one of the lead characters to have a unibrow. This doesn’t increase your confidence. You think fondly of those other things you’ve always associated with college—Animal House! That YouTube video “I Love College!” Recently, “The House Bunny”! Where are the frat houses? Where are the nubile, tan people you were hoping would be a significant part of your college experience?  
Apparently, they are in the room where you are staying. When you meander back from an evening of milk and cookies with a group of lovely people who should be gently encouraged to bathe more, your host tells you that you can’t walk through the bedroom to your sleeping bag because, at long last, her roommate and her roommate’s boyfriend are consummating their relationship. You climb out onto the roof, crawling along a drain pipe until you reach a window that you think is yours. It’s not, but you climb inside and fall asleep anyway. In the morning, you are awakened by Harvard pop sensation Peter Shields, who seems confused that you are in his bathroom. 
Tomorrow you will go to a comedy show, an a cappella jam, more info meetings, and another ice-cream social. You will stagger home, chastened and broken in spirit, pursued by incessant e-mails from organizations you signed up for in a frenzy induced by three hours of 1920s jazz standards.  
Now, dodging to avoid a tourist, you stumble into a puddle and ruin the Harvard sweatpants you impetuously purchased. As you sink down in the middle of the Yard, sobbing, a light rain begins to fall. What is this place? Who are these people? You wonder what you’re doing here. So did we all. 
Harvard is full of startlingly normal people who are as surprised to be here as you are. And, actually, there is a scientific reason for this. Dean William Fitzimmons explained that Harvard admits only about 300 people for purely academic reasons, the rare geniuses who rediscovered plutonium and finished Math 55 in high school. (One lived on my floor freshman year. At least, he was rumored to, but he never emerged during the daytime.) In addition to this are some people who excel early in specific fields. The rest of the class is made up of well-rounded, normal people. They come from everywhere in the world, they share your passions, they will make you laugh, and they will teach you about yourself.  And you won’t meet any of them during prefrosh weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last year, Harvard has faced diverse and troubling news in the financial sphere. From President Drew G. Faust’s alarmed February letter about the endowment and to Dean Michael D. Smith’s announcement 10 days ago of the need for Faculty of Arts and Sciences “restructuring,” everyone has been looking for places to cut. And they have found them. Departments have slashed around 15 percent of costs, Allston development has been significantly delayed, and undergraduate Houses have had to tweak refurbishment plans. Furthermore, the university went ahead with a voluntary early retirement program and an across-the-board hiring and wage freeze. 
Meanwhile, the national media has used Harvard as a symbol of the bubble: The endowment that quadrupled since 2000 is now crashing down, producing a hard landing for the Harvard Management Company. Given the illiquid nature of many of the diversified endowment’s assets, the university has had to issue IOUs with comparatively high yields to maintain the liquidity needed to keep functioning. 
Across the board, the message is simple: Stay put, cut where possible–these are not times to dream big. 
I strongly disagree with that position. The university’s deep financial crisis notwithstanding, I believe this is a time for Harvard to spend, and spend handsomely, in order to seize another opportunity to improve its international reach, quality of education, and commitment to its ideals. It is a well-known and documented problem that most of the funds that Harvard has are overseen by strict stipulations of how they can be spent. Neither the state of Massachusetts nor the lawyers of those who have donated to Harvard throughout the years are easy to please–but this is a unique time, when they may be more amenable to change. That is precisely why the University should try to use this opportunity to release more funds–and then use them to literally reactivate and reinvigorate the community. 
The projects that Harvard is currently considering cutting or delaying–like housing renovations and Allston development–will have tangible detrimental effects on the quality of the education it provides. No matter how we spin it, slower Allston construction means less science research in the medium term. It also means fewer students enrolled and less academic expansion into other fields. Tweaked House renovation plans mean slow progress in improving undergraduate education, no expansion of social spaces, and less overall satisfaction. Perhaps most importantly, department cuts not only affect the quality of the catering at faculty meetings but also impact the way our professors will be able to teach present and future students. For instance, the announcement yesterday that a great-books program within General Education would be delayed (perhaps forever) due to lack of funds is plainly unacceptable, since it is an issue that both senior faculty and students have long considered important for the Core’s successor. 
Because of the service it provides, Harvard should think of itself more like a government than an individual or a business firm. With its reputation and available funds, the university is not going anywhere, but delaying improvements will have dismal effects on future endowment performance. The current global economic crisis is being fought by governments from South Africa to Japan with counter-cyclical measures that attempt to hasten the move from recession to growth. The now-revived Keynesian approach justifies the deep temporary deficits with the promise of future growth. The same applies to Harvard, for the endowment will continue to grow–and receive fresh funds–as soon as growth resumes. Hence we should behave counter-cyclically, helping the economy and the community in the process. 
This is not to say we should be crass Keynesians. Crises often spur efficiency reviews that help organizations in the long run by improving performance. Ultimately, the point is that we should not consider the endowment a fixed and static managed investment. Rather, it is a self-regenerating pool of funds that is directly impacted by the result of our community achievements. More and happier students will donate more in the future, as happened when Harvard weathered the 1930s Depression. Allston will bring better research, attract better faculty, and bring more prestige to the university. Housing renovations will improve student life and happiness surveys—the backbone of FAS. Hence the debate should not be about changing the way HMC invests (they almost always know better than the pundits), but rather about enacting counter-cyclical measures to take advantage of the downturn in order to grow faster and stronger than the competition.
Ultimately, the point is more than just about numbers and future compensation in terms of donations. It is about Harvard’s ideal of providing the best possible education. Our community’s investment goes beyond bricks and mortar–it is in our students’ lives. And we can trust that will pay off.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through all the current optimism about negotiations and rapprochement with Iran, we cannot lose sight of one basic fact: Allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons would destabilize the entire international order. 
Most international observers, including the International Atomic Energy Agency have agreed that Iran is operating an illicit uranium-enrichment program to develop material for use in a nuclear weapon. It is the national interest of the United States, Israel, Russia, the European Union, and most Arab nations to prevent this nation from developing nuclear weapons. 
First, the development of nuclear weapons is a blatant violation of international law under Iran’s obligations to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Perhaps more importantly, we must recognize that Iran is a nation run by a group of fundamentalist extremists, the public face of which is a dictator who denies the Holocaust and who has insisted over and over that he intends to wipe the “bacteria” or “stinking carcass” (depending on the day) of Israel off the map. The Iranian government actively funds and supports terrorist groups that attack American soldiers in Iraq and Israeli civilians and soldiers.
Iran, like North Korea, has recently been testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran’s nuclear development has been allowed to run practically unchecked for years, and they are now moving closer to developing a working nuclear bomb. 
An Iranian nuclear program is perhaps the gravest existential threat possible for Israel—it represents an enemy committed to the destruction of their homeland, with the capability of doing so in a matter of tens of minutes. A situation in which such an enemy has the capability of pushing a button that has a significant chance of wiping out their country 30 minutes later is clearly not a tenable one for the Israelis.
But it’s not just Israel’s problem. When it comes to the threat presented by a nuclear Iran, Israel’s and America’s interests are firmly in sync. The threat to Israel is obvious, and Israel is by far the United States’s strongest ally in the region and the most stable, prosperous, democratic, and advanced nation in that part of the world. But, in addition to that, the existence of an Iranian nuclear weapon would create a strong incentive for other Arab states to develop nuclear weapons. If Iran develops a bomb, other nations that have had nuclear-weapons programs in the past or that have the technical capability to develop one fairly quickly, such as Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, might feel compelled to develop their own weapons in order to maintain the balance of power in the region. 
In the 64 years of existence of atomic weapons, only 10 nations have actually built them, eight of which were during the Cold War and one of which later gave up its weapons (South Africa). Clearly, the non-proliferation strategies employed to this date are working fairly well. The development of an Iranian nuclear weapon, then, could double the number of nuclear-armed nations in a small fraction of that time, representing a major setback for the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. This would mark a return to a Cold War-like era in which a danger of nuclear war is a real, imminent, and most dangerous threat facing policymakers. 
We are living in a world with a plethora of problems, and a nuclear Iran would only serve to exacerbate them. There can be no greater foreign policy goal for President Obama than to prevent this frightening distortion, in which not just two but perhaps 20 nations face one another at the opposite ends of nuclear weapons, waiting on a hair-trigger to launch an atomic conflagration. An Iranian nuclear weapon would be the gravest threat to world peace since the fall of the Soviet Union and would raise the specter of a real nuclear conflict for the first time since the 1980s. Allowing a nation that actively funds and supports terrorist groups active in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories to develop nuclear weapons is simply unthinkable and does not coordinate in the slightest way with American foreign policy. 
President Obama’s recent overtures to Iran represent a positive step forward. But ,considering Iran’s history of diplomatic deception, he must proceed cautiously. While diplomacy will hopefully convince Iran to abandon its weapons program, no option should be left off the table. It is clear beyond all doubt that allowing, or not actively preventing, Iran from developing nuclear weapons will have profoundly dangerous consequences for the people living under the oppressive regime in that country, for the citizens of every other Middle Eastern country, and indeed for the international community as a whole. The United States—and any nation that favors the balance of world peace—must prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon at all costs. The costs associated with any alternative are simply too disastrous for the world to tolerate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Obama’s administration recently announced that it would not require Iran to cease uranium enrichment as a prerequisite for talks. This reflects a welcome change in policy from the Bush administration. Decades of sanctions—and a refusal to engage with Iran unless itmet stringent preconditions—failed to stop its nuclear enrichment program. While Iran suspended its official nuclear weapons program in 2003, we still face a dangerous situation today. 
Iran possesses the knowledge and capability to enrich enough uranium to make one or two bombs a year, and it already has 2,200 pounds of low-enriched uranium—enough for one bomb upon further enrichment. The international community lacks sufficient oversight to be sure the Iranians are not operating a covert weapons program at this very moment and has no assurances that they will not resume their official weapons program at any time.
A nuclear Iran poses a serious threat to America and the international order. While much speculation about the dangers of a nuclear Iran focuses on the potential for Iran to use a nuclear bomb against American forces abroad or our homeland, the greater threat comes from the cascading effect of a nuclear Iran in the region and on the international stage. 
In January, news surfaced that Israel secretly approached the Bush administration last year seeking flyover rights in Iraq and bunker-busting bombs to use in a preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear sites. This should be cause for grave concern, because, given America’s ties to Israel, if Israel were to launch a preemptive strike against Iran, America would almost certainly be drawn into an explosive conflict. Furthermore, a nuclear Iran poses a potential threat to its neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia, with which it is jockeying for control of the region and has longstanding religious disagreements. A bomb in Tehran might push Riyadh to seek one as well, which could start a nuclear armament race in the Middle East as Egypt, Turkey, and Iraq scramble to keep up. This is the last thing that the region needs.
It is clear that the international community must take steps to prevent Tehran from acquiring a bomb. America’s strategy so far—sanctioning Iran, refusing to talk until Iran meets unrealistic preconditions, and labeling Iran as part of the “axis of evil”—has only increased the danger to America from a nuclear Iran. It has not deterred it from seeking to expand its enrichment capabilities at Natantz from no centrifuges in 2005 to more than 3,000 today. 
The Obama administration has an opportunity to change America’s approach and to engage with Iran on this issue, as well as other critical national security fronts, such as Tehran’s involvement in Iraq and its support of Hezbollah and other terrorist groups. Obama’s Nowruz message to the Islamic world signaled a sharp shift and willingness to open a new dialogue.
But, as Obama begins engagement with Iran, he should keep several things in mind. First, the Iranian enrichment program is completely legal under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and Iran is highly unlikely to give it up. Furthermore, even if Iran were banned from operating an official enrichment program, now that Iranian scientists understand the process and have even constructed their own (higher-performing) centrifuges, we will still face the very real danger of a covert Iranian nuclear weapons program. Therefore, a key component of the American solution must be a robust IAEA inspections program throughout the entire country, not just the current enrichment sites and a handful of other identified areas of interest. This must be coupled with a clear set of consequences for Iran if evidence surfaces of a reconstituted weapons program. Comprehensive inspections that the Iranians perceive as likely to uncover any covert program, coupled with serious punishments if the inspectors discover such a program, will be the best deterrent.
Sticks alone will not be sufficient. As history reveals time and time again, the greatest force for stability, growth, and a decrease in hostility toward the West is greater integration into the international systems of politics and economics. A plan including gradual lifting of sanctions and reestablishment of diplomatic relationships with Tehran encourages compliance with inspection requirements and heightens the stakes for Iran if it defaults. It also promotes a more positive relationship with Iran going forward and opens the door for cooperation on mutual objects like preventing the emergence of failed states in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Finally, the U.S. must reaffirm its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation everywhere. We should lead by example and take public and significant efforts to reduce our weapons stockpiles as well as encouraging Russia to do the same. The rising calls of a number of eminent Americans, including the “Four Horsemen” (George Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and Sam Nunn) in several recent articles, lay out a nuclear-free world as the only possible stable endpoint. As long as nuclear weapons exist anywhere, no one is safe, particularly in this age of terrorism, when bombs can no longer serve as deterrents for stateless actors who believe themselves martyrs.
Obama’s presidency provides America with a window of opportunity to engage with Iran and chart a new productive course forward. But we must act soon, we must act intelligently, and we must recognize that preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is important, but it is just one piece in the larger fight against nuclear proliferation worldwide—a fight we (and the world) must win.

For the past 40 years, Iran has been viewed as a national security threat to both the Middle East and the U.S. As Iran becomes more aggressive in its acquisition of enriched uranium and a nuclear weapon, now is hardly the time to allow it to succeed. President Obama’s intention to waive the previous condition for negotiation—that Iran suspend its nuclear program—is not only troubling in the national security problems that it presents, but also in the legitimacy it adds to the Iran regime’s troubling course of domestic action.
On the campaign trail, Obama promised direct talks with Iran in an effort to bring peace and stability to the Middle East. In principle, such a policy is laudable: The U.S. often engages in diplomatic efforts with unfriendly nations, sometimes even in the midst of conflict (such as in the case of former President Reagan’s willingness to talk to Moscow during the Cold War). However, Obama’s proposal to do so with no preconditions is naiveté at its finest. In fact, even the Iranians themselves admit that negotiations provide more time for Iran to come closer to creating a nuclear weapon as they stonewall negotiations with the U.S. and other Western nations. It allows them to purchase approval of their domestic policy on the cheap. Perhaps this is why Secretary of State Hillary Clinton indicated that the administration might renege on its promise of direct talks with no preconditions.
This potential change in U.S. policy toward Iran is troubling because Iran has demonstrated its ambition for nuclear weapons with alarming regularity. In February, the Iranian government launched a satellite into space. While not large enough to launch missiles, it demonstrated that Iran had developed the technology necessary in order to do so in the future and, perhaps more importantly, had an intention to continue exploring this form of military technology. About two weeks ago, Iran unveiled its first nuclear fuel manufacturing plant and announced an increased ability in processing uranium, despite the fact that the Iranian government agreed to engage in a “dialogue with respect” with President Obama. In spite of the Iranian regime’s repeated claims to the contrary, these actions present legitimate cause for concern for the safety of U.S. allies in the region. 
Obama would do well to recall the history of North Korea’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon. Former President Bill Clinton’s best diplomatic efforts were not enough to stop North Korea from pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003—North Korea’s decision to do so was in direct violation of the 1994 agreement negotiated between the U.S. and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Indeed, no diplomatic agreement seems powerful enough to restrain Kim Jong Il’s appetite for nukes: Even after destroying the cooling tower of itsmain nuclear facility pursuant to an agreement negotiated under the Bush administration, North Korea secretly (and, recently, publicly) continued its nuclear weapons program. 
Given the regional instability generated by a nuclear North Korea, this is an experience Obama should not be keen to repeat. While the situation with Iran differs from North Korea in important ways—Iran is still a signatory of the NPT and is a more democratic state—there are still lessons to be learned. First, being a partner in the NPT or other diplomatic agreement today does not guarantee Iran will continue to be forever; indeed, a nuclear Iran summarily withdrawing from the NPT is not a far stretch of the imagination, nor is continued covert nuclear development in violation of negotiated treaties. Moreover, today’s “peaceful, power-generating purposes” is easily replaced with tomorrow’s “self-defense” as a reason for nuclear development once Iran succeeds in developing a nuclear weapon. 
Beyond the enforcement and regional stability problems, Obama’s friendly gestures to Iran also perversely give misguided legitimacy to President Ahmadinejad’s regime in its reelection bid. The regime’s policies against civil rights for women and government actions silencing those seeking a democratic form of government gain more domestic support as Iran faces less international isolation. Changing the fundamental nature of the relationship between Iran and the rest of the world will come only from changing the composition and guiding philosophies of those who rule. The U.S. must encourage democracy in Iran and allow the dwindling number of extremists to take their rightful place: without the reins of government control. In the upcoming June elections, Iran has an opportunity to elect a more moderate leader, Mir Hussein Moussavi, who has promised to improve relations with the West, to increase freedoms domestically, and to mark a distinction between “weaponization and nuclear technologies.” Talks that allow the current Iranian administration to demonstrate foreign policy success only amplifies its message and detracts from the increasing resentment of the Iranian people towardstheir current leadership. 
Obama marked his proposed discussion with Iranian leaders as “the promise of a new beginning.” While it is indeed a departure from past policy, his “new beginning” is not the right solution for dealing with a country that defies international sanctions, has shown animosity toward the Western world, and is within reach of the most powerful and deadly weapons known to man. It may be time for new ideas, but any plan that allows Iran to continue developing nuclear capabilities under its current ideology and leadership is not a sound one.

The media has once again proven capable of amplifying the United Nations anti-racism contretemps as well as the plight of yet another privileged dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran to echo a fresh confirmation of the old accusations. Just as the real possibility of a U.S.-Iran rapprochement began to transcend the nuclear issue and seem no longer a mere fantasy with Washington’s change of atmosphere and Tehran’s continuous pragmatism, the opposing forces to dialogue in Washington and beyond have now found new grounds in Roxana Saberi’s arbitrary imprisonment and President Ahmadinejad’s repeated accusation of Israel of racism. How to resist these negative cues in favor of abundantly positive ones is a diplomatic test of both parties’ good faith for a genuine and meaningful negotiation—a difficult test indeed.
Ms. Saberi’s plain disregard of multiple warnings to cease reporting after her press credentials were revoked in 2006 provides ample material for a fair process of appeal but does not make the Revolutionary Court’s summary trial and its eight-year imprisonment sentence any less disturbing. Likewise, the media’s hype and portrayal of her as a pure beauty pageant queen to be rescued by the West from the dragon’s mouth just shortly after the silent death of a 29-year-old blogger in prison, Omidreza Mirsayafi, and the White House’s and Secretary of State’s parental support of her case surely take away from the public’s sympathy towards Saberi but are irrelevant to her irrevocable right to a fair trial. 
As most analysts agree, Saberi and another Iranian-American arrested last year, Esha Momeni, are to be used as leverage in any future U.S.-Iran negotiations, possibly to demand the release of two Iranian nationals taken by U.S. forces in Irbil in 2007. Alternatively, Saberi may be a victim of Iran’s judiciary hardliner’s backlash against the clear signals of an increasingly positive attitude toward a US-Iran rapprochement among various power factions in Tehran. 
What to take away from the Saberi trial now is up to the Obama administration. It could follow the drums of the anti-dialogue voices and use Saberi’s case to once again balk at pursuing negotiation, or it could give credit—for whatever it’s worth—to Ahmadinejad’s public defense of Saberi’s right to appeal and view that, as a signal, Tehran is not willing to lose the diplomatic progress of the past season after Obama’s inauguration. The stakes are too high to mistake the right signals at this point.
But just as Iran’s supreme leader, in reaction to Obama’s Nowruz message, asked, “I would like to say that I do not know who makes decisions for America, the president, the Congress, behind-the-scene elements?”, Washington may be understandably confused after Ahmadinejad’s mixed message in Geneva. However, a more crucial question to ask is how relevant Ahmadinejad’s anti-Zionist comments are to a U.S.-Iran negotiation. For the record, Ahmadinejad’s voice, as presented in the statement, only repeats Durban’s 2001 acrimony over Zionism and racism—no originality scored here. Ahmadinejad’s entirely unnecessary dwelling on the question was as far from the good, old art of diplomacy as the walkouts and boycotts of the conference altogether. 
Again, the U.S. administration has a choice to make: It could watch undecidedly as President Ahmadinejad’s rhetoric is blown out of proportion to picture Zionism as a central question of any U.S.-Iran relationship, or it could take stock of the recent welcoming signals by factions previously hostile to the very name of America to persist in pursuing dialogue in good faith. The Palestinian question, central to any conceivable peace in the Middle East, is not central to the beginning of U.S.-Iran negotiations. If a complex and dynamic nation, which cannot be naively summed up in Shi’a martyrdom or epic nationalism, has reached a level of post-revolutionary maturity to prioritize its interests, why should not America heed the right cues when the time seems to be just right?

Iran’s influence on international relations cannot be overstated. The country is at the center of some of the most hotly debated concerns, including nuclear weapons, oil, terrorism, and the state of Israel. Iran will necessarily be the key focus of President Obama’s foreign policy, and the status of the U.S.-Iran relationship will determine the shape of international politics for the foreseeable future. The pieces in the focus examine Iran’s actions and conduct and highlight potential policies, reponses, and attitudes as a means to address the most pertinent concerns.

Harvard Management Company—which oversees the University’s multi-billion dollar endowment—announced a new managing director of real estate investments Tuesday, after the position had remained vacant for over a year.Daniel W. Cummings, a former managing director at private equity titan The Carlyle Group, will join the Company at the end of June.The appointment comes at a crucial time, with University officials scrambling to adjust budgets to accommodate a projected 30 percent drop in the endowment for the fiscal year. HMC’s previous director for real estate, David Ferrero, stepped down in Aug. 2007, according to money management newspaper Pensions & Investments.HMC announced in February that it would lay off roughly a quarter of its 200 employees, mostly support staff, in an attempt to “re-balance and re-engineer the organization.”Real estate has traditionally been a difficult asset class to valuate and provides very limited liquidity. According to a University statement, real estate investments currently make up approximately 7 to 8 percent of the University’s endowment—a slight drop from the 9 percent, or almost $3.5 billion, allocated in 2008. Cummings will work with HMC’s head of external management, CEO, and real estate team to fill a “critical and strategic role” for the company “in light of the current global credit and real estate market environment,” according to a University statement. Jane L. Mendillo, President and CEO of HMC since last July, praised Cummings’ “depth of national and global experience,” “sharp eye for anticipating market trends,” and “outstanding ability for developing innovative investment strategies.”Cummings, who is currently a managing director at real estate investment firm Matapeake Partners, once managed $22 billion worth of North American and European public and private real estate investments for LaSalle Investment Management, where he served as a Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Investment Officer. Real assets as a whole—which include liquid commodities, real estate, and timber and agricultural land—represented 26 percent of the endowment in 2008, according to a Harvard financial statement. Last year, the real estate portfolio provided returns of 3.2 percent—beating the HMC board-approved benchmark of 2.4 percent. Cummings, a Chicago and Dartmouth graduate, said in the University statement that he was “honored to be joining such a world-class group of investment managers,” and that he looked forward to furthering Harvard’s educational and research mission. Cummings did not respond to requests for comment at his Matapeake office, and former real estate director Ferrero was traveling Thursday, according to a staff member at his current firm.—Staff writer Peter F.

The Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub was filled with freshman last night at the first Annual Freshman Spelling Bee. With former Howard Scripps National Spelling Bee Champion George A. Thampy ’10 presiding as emcee, spellers and audience members gathered for a night of pizza bagels, french fries, and multisyllabic words.The Freshman Dean’s Office-organized event was an intramural competition that attracted 22 freshman spellers who had the chance to bring 100 points and glory to their respective dorms. According to Thampy, the competition included words that were accessible to spelling neophytes and more obscure words intended to pose a challenge to more advanced spellers. The competitors were of varying experience levels and spelling backgrounds. Some, like Tengbo Li ’12 of Grays Hall, had “a deep and irrevocable love for orthography.” Others, like Ryan D. Smith ’12 of Pennypacker, “came for food and to have some food... [to] relive the glory days from elementary school.” The mood was social and collegial as spectators cheered on friends and dormmates; Duc P. Luu ’12 of Thayer was greeted with a rousing “Quack, Quack, Quack” from his cheering squad as he took the stage to successfully spell the word “donnybrook.”The words increased in obscurity and difficulty as the competition wore on, with more common words such as “retaliate” eventually giving way to lexicographical oddities such as “cummerbund,” which elicited giggles from the college-aged audience. Round One ended with all but one contestant still in play, but Round Two signaled the introduction of more difficult words. At times the word difficulty seem to vary dramatically from contestant to contestant. One ousted speller highlighted this trend with the statement, “Are you serious? We went from shrapnel to Gethsemane?”As the competition reached its later stages, the field was trimmed dramatically due to the appearance of words that not even Microsoft Word’s spellcheck could comprehend, such as fomites, skookum, and sialogogue. By this point, the number of contestants was reduced to four: Mass. Hall’s Athena L. Lao, Greenough’s Steven N. Maheshwary, Richard C. Alt of Matthews, and Pennypacker’s Ryan D. Smith. All four contestants spelled their words incorrectly in the initial segment of the final round. Lao then spelled two words in a row correctly, ending the first annual Freshman Spelling Bee with a flawless spelling of “Planilla,” and netting 100 points for Mass. Hall in addition to $100 for herself. Alt, Smith, and Maheshwary tied for second place and will split the second place prizes for themselves and their respective dorms.After offering high fives to her co-competitors and accepting her reward, Lao said of her victory, “I feel great, I used to do spelling bees in middle school so I was hoping that what I learned in middle school didn’t leave me. So I’m glad I was able to remember some of it.”

Researchers from the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have successfully controlled the polarization of semi-conductor lasers, the School announced this month. 
The research has a wide variety of practical applications for fields such as satellite communications, quantum cryptography, and biomedical research—all of which demand highly directional lasers. 
The researchers—who worked in conjunction with scientists from the Hamamatsu Photonics laboratory Japan—focused on decreasing the beam divergence of semiconductor lasers by affecting the design of the lasers through nanotechnology, rather than employing typically-used polarizers or laser plates. 
“We wanted to create integrated optical components for lasers,” said Nanfang Yu, a fifth-year graduate student in engineering who helped lead the project. “Conventionally people use old types of optical components to control polarization...these are very expensive. Our approach is to make microscopic, metallic structures.”
This was the first time that semiconductor lasers have been shown to possess decreased beam divergence as compared to standard semiconductor lasers.
“The idea is that by using nanotechnology we can essentially design a laser beam with certain properties,” said Federico Capasso, an applied physics professor. 
Capasso—who led the project along with Yu—called his work “beam engineering.”
“It is a new wave of photonics that we are opening up,” Capasso said.
Though some in industry have expressed great interest in the work—according to Yu—and Harvard has filed a patent on the product, it may be years before the invention will be marketable.
Yu said that researchers are currently working on improving aspects of the prototype with the hope of reaching that goal.
“This is preliminary research,” said Capasso. “Any practical development is years ahead.”

To clarify common misconceptions about Mormons, the Harvard Latter-Day Saint Student Association held a “Meet the Mormons Q&A” panel yesterday during which they encouraged students to ask questions about the church.The event began with two brief presentations by Kenneth I. Brewer ’11 and Lindsey R. Brinton ’12, who talked about the history of church and current theological doctrines, followed by questions from the audience.When asked about the issue of polygamy in an interview before the event, LDSSA Vice-President Morgan T. Pope ’11 pointed out that the general public sometimes held an outdated view of Mormon beliefs.“People still associate us with polygamy even though it’s been more than 100 years out of practice,” he said.Last year’s questions focused on Mormon’s missionary work since not many people know why Mormons take time off to go on missions or what they do, said LDSSA historian Nicola A. Harris ’10.This year, the main themes in the Q&A session were marriage, the value of family, and women’s role in the church.Attendees asked about Mormon attitudes regarding marriages between homosexual couples, marriage between LDS members and non-LDS members. Others questioned why women were not allowed to be on the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a governing body in the Mormon church hierarchy, and why they are not expected to go on missions to seek converts.Harris, who will be going on a mission, told the audience that more and more Mormon women were going on missions.“There’s no stigma either way,” she said. “I want to go because I feel I have this beautiful gift and that’s precious to me.”Audience member Erin E. Harrington ’12 said she attended the panel because she didn’t know much about the religion and felt that it was easier to ask a group of people rather than her Mormon friends individually.Panelist Tyler R. Clites ’12 said that he felt like he had been preparing for questions about his faith all his life.Clites said he volunteered to be a panelist because he has never found it difficult to speak about his religion and also thought the event would be good practice for answering questions on his mission.Attendee Jeffrey L. Hall ’11 said that he admired the thoughtfulness of the panelists.“A lot of people don’t know why they do or don’t believe in something,” he said. “I just thought they were able to give reasons...and I thought that was great.”In the end, LDSSA President Rachel A. Esplin ’10 said she hoped that people left the Q&A understanding that “we’re normal people who want to share our faith and that we’re accepting of other people.”

Two activists argued for expanding hate crime laws at a panel in Sever Hall last night, stressing the current difficulties of navigating the U.S. legal system as a transgender person.
Gunner Scott, the director of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, said such obstacles made it critical to change existing hate crime and discrimination statutes to cover gender identity and expression.
Statewide legislation on the topic is currently pending in the Massachusetts joint judiciary committee, and local laws have already been adopted by Boston and Cambridge.
Scott and the coalition lobbied on behalf of the Boston anti-discrimination law before it was passed in Oct. 2002 and are now working on behalf of the passage of a statewide law.
“Trans people are the one minority that really have no discrimination coverage in this country,” said former Harvard Trans Task Force Chair Lisa J. Miracchi ’09, who organized the panel.
The event began with a comic titled “A few reasons why (we need a transgender rights bill),” which vividly portrayed the daily hardships faced by transgender individuals.
“I’m SO sorry, ‘Miss,’ but our last available apartment was JUST rented five minutes ago!” one speech bubble read.
M. Barusch ’06, the other presenter, reflected on her experiences as a member of the Massachusetts Trans Legal Advocates, a group of law students who advise transgender people for free. 
Barusch is now a law student at Boston University, but as a Harvard undergraduate, she chaired the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporters Alliance, now known as Harvard College Queer Students and Allies.
She enumerated a long list of legal issues for which transgender people need additional legal assistance.
Transgender people face legal dilemmas while transitioning from one gender to another, including changing their names and IDs to reflect their new gender, she said.
But Barusch emphasized that transgender people have a hard time navigating more common legal issues, including immigration, housing, and the prison system.
“A lot of these legal issues can be exacerbated by transphobia,” Barusch said.
For example, prisons are often gender-segregated, posing problems for transgender people who are incarcerated and often suffer from extreme harassment, she said.
Miracchi said she arranged the event to increase awareness for trans issues.
“Once you know people who face this everyday difficulty navigating the world, it touches you,” Miracchi said. “I couldn’t not try to do something about it.”

First-year Harvard Medical School student Shantanu K. Gaur ’08 was sitting in the Dorchester home of a 75-year-old colorectal cancer patient in February when he received a phone call informing him that he had been awarded the prestigious $72,000 Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship. But instead of taking the call, Gaur silenced his cell phone and continued his home interview with the patient.It was only later that he checked his voicemail messages to learn that he was one of eight Harvard graduate students to snag the award.The fellowship recognizes new Americans—immigrants and their children—for creativity, accomplishment, and citizenship. The winners are highly motivated, focused, and committed to a particular field, ranging from public health to foreign policy.Program Director Warren F. Ilchman said that the fellowship aims to identify leaders and help them “make the contribution they are capable of making.”That eight of this year’s 31 fellows are Harvard students did not come as a surprise to Ilchman. He said that the school writes extremely strong recommendation letters and emphasizes the opportunities available to its already exceptional student body.A number of the graduate students who received the fellowship this year said the money would give them the financial flexibility to pursue their passions.“There are a few public health projects that I want to get off the ground,” Gaur said.  He intends to work on an online pharmacy project that examine Web sites that illicitly sell prescription drugs, an under-studied public health problem, Gaur said.Other students said that they would use the money to pay off graduate school debt, which Soros Fellow Previn Warren ’04 described as “wildly expensive beyond anyone’s reasonable dreams or expectations.”“If I didn’t have this,” Warren said, “I would have to go work at a private sector firm to pay off debt.”The first-year Law School student said he now plans to pursue a career in academia or public service instead.According to first-year HMS student Tomasz P. Stryjewski, a Polish immigrant interested in ophthalmology, another benefit of the fellowship is access to a community of scholars. The Soros programs boasts alumni whose accomplishments include publishing books, earning patents, and clerking for the Supreme Court.Law School student and fellowship winner Tarun Chhabra also commended the tight alumni network.“I think what is striking about the current and past fellows that I’ve met is just a really strong sense of direction and a commitment to certain ideas,” he said.But the prospect of joining such distinguished company is, for Chhabra—who has conducted research for the United Nations and served as a consultant for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs—somewhat overwhelming.“It was a mistake, a fluke. I definitely do not belong on that roster,” he said—Staff writer Niha S. Jain can be reached at nsjain@fas.harvard.edu.

A Harvard lab recently discovered single-celled microbes living in isolation for millions of years beneath an Antarctic glacier once believed inhospitable to all life.
The findings below the Taylor Glacier contradicts the long-held belief that subglacial environments, which lack light, oxygen, or food, cannot support life. 
The team of researchers, including Ann Pearson of Harvard and Jill Mikucki of Dartmouth, was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, NASA, and Harvard’s Microbial Sciences Initiative.
According to Pearson, an associate professor of earth and planetary sciences, the team based the research on samples collected from Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys. This region is considered to be one of the world’s most extreme deserts and contains an iron-rich subglacial outflow, Blood Falls, which trickles from the Taylor Glacier. 
Pearson said Mikucki would camp out by the falls for weeks at a time for a number of years, waiting for the sporadic melting events during the summer when it would be just warm enough for the glacier to melt and for brine to flow out. 
Within this brine, the research team discovered roughly a dozen species of prokaryotic microbes about the size of bacteria buried deep beneath the glacier. 
“What’s truly amazing about this discovery is microbial continuity, how microbial communities can survive intense stresses and very dramatic cold stages. These microbes have been living in isolation for millions of years and yet they still bear great resemblance to modern marine species,” Pearson said. 
At Harvard’s Hoffman Laboratory, Pearson and her colleagues discovered that these anaerobic microorganisms survive on iron that leaks out from the bedrock with the help of a sulfur catalyst. The microbes have adapted to the hostile subglacial environment by developing a new life cycle in which they breathe iron through sulfur. 
Without any light for photosynthesis, the microbes have presumably survived by feeding on the organic matter trapped within their habitat when the massive Taylor Glacier sealed them off an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million years ago.
According to Pearson, there could be a rich and diverse ecosystem that thrives beneath the glaciers. She even suggested that there could perhaps be life on other icy planets in the solar system; below the Martian ice caps or in the ice-covered oceans of Europa, a moon of Jupiter.
Further research on these microbes is being conducted by Jill Mikucki, a research associate in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth.For recent research, faculty profiles, and a look at the issues facing Harvard scientists, check out The Crimson's science page.

Researchers at the Harvard-affiliated Children’s Hospital Boston have developed a long–lasting nerve block that could aid in the treatment of pain for patients undergoing surgery or experiencing chronic pain.
The anesthetic can be injected locally without causing nerve and muscle toxicity, according to Hila Epstein-Barash, the lead author of the paper and a research fellow.
“One of the main limitations to developments of these technologies previously was getting bad tissue reactions—nerve and muscle injuries,” said Daniel S. Kohane, one of the senior authors and an associate professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School. “The compounds we use tend to have little or no direct neurotoxic or muscle-toxic effects.”
The researchers packaged various combinations of compounds into liposomes—fat-and-lipid based particles found in cells—and injected the slow release anesthetic drug-delivery systems into rats to examine their effects. 
Kohane said the “key” ingredient was saxitoxin, a known antibiotic, that produced nerve blocks lasting up to two days.
When saxitoxin was combined with the steroid dexamethasone, the nerve block extended for seven days, said Epstein-Barash.
Unlike conventional anesthetics, which often cause toxicity to surrounding tissues, impeding the development of slow-release anesthetic systems, the sustained release formulation containing saxitoxin resulted in very high local concentration—“the rat’s leg fell asleep”, said Kohane—but surrounding tissue did not sustain damage.
“The real importance is not just in getting very long nerve blocks, but getting long nerve blocks with no local toxicity and no systemic toxicity,” Kohane added. 
While there is still a long way to go from testing in rats to clinical trials in humans, “it looks very promising”, said Epstein-Barash. 
“Hopefully there will be a lot of applications for this when patients have pain from either operations or a chronic condition,” said Robert S. Langer, one of the authors and a professor of chemical engineering at MIT. “This could possibly lead to the first long acting nerve block, which is very exciting.”

In an effort to draw attention to Americans’ overconsumption of sugared drinks, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have renovated a Web site that provides detailed information and practical tips for people to make healthy dietary choices. 
The researchers added an extensive section called “Choosing Health Drinks” earlier this week to Nutrition Source—a Web site maintained by HSPH faculty that aims to translate nutrition research into easy-to-understand information for the public and policy makers.
“In the last several years there’s been a body of new data showing the adverse relationship between sugared drinks and obesity and Type II diabetes,” said Walter C. Willett, chair of the nutrition department. “This problem now has an urgency that did not exist five years ago.”
Researchers decided to expand Nutrition Source—accessible online at http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/—in order to raise awareness among a public they say is largely unaware of the amount of sugar they consume in liquid form.
The new features on the Web site display graphics comparing the amount of sugar in popular brands of carbonated soft drinks, fruit juice, fruit punch, energy drinks, and others.
According to Lilian Cheung—the editorial director for Nutrition Source—the goal of the online renovations is not just to teach people how to make personal health choices, but also to create an environment that’s conducive for individuals to make these healthy choices. 
“That’s why we’re trying to draw attention from all sectors of society,” said Cheung.
The researchers have also used the Web site as a platform to call for action by the government and business corporations. 
The Web site pushes for beverage manufacturers to produce drinks with one gram of sugar per ounce, a 70 percent reduction that Willett said would constitute “a huge improvement.”
The Web site also proposes that the FDA mandate the amount of sugar to be labeled in the nutrition labels as per-bottle as opposed to per-serving. 
Willett said that these changes would reduce Americans’ penchant for sugar and condition their palates to a lower level of sweetness.
According to Nutrition Source, four out of five U.S. children and two out of three U.S. adults drink sugar-sweetened beverages each day, with the popular twelve-ounce can of soft drink or juice containing anywhere from ten to twelve teaspoons of refined sugar.
“If you think about downing twelve teaspoon of sugar, that would make you gag,” said Willett. “But everyday a large majority of Americans unknowingly do just that.”

A new study has found that people with conduct disorder, body image disorder, or both are more prone to become dependent on anabolic steroids, according to Harrison G. Pope ’69, a Harvard Medical School professor of psychiatry and lead author of the study.
Conduct disorder is the juvenile version of antisocial disorder, and body image disorder is an unhealthy obsession with the size and appearance of one’s body.
These two factors were found by interviewing and examining the medical histories of 134 weight lifters, who were categorized into three groups—non-steroid users, steroid users with no dependence, and steroid users that had developed dependence.
Pope said more studies are needed to fully uncover the consequences of steroids.
“Steroids are a fairly new phenomenon in the drug abuse scene,” he said. “Science is only now beginning to answer many questions about the effects, especially the long-term effects.”
But contrary to previous beliefs, the study suggested that steroid users do not have an increased risk of prostrate cancer, but are more likely to suffer from cardiac disease and mood disorders.
Some of the effects may be reversible once steroid intake is stopped, but things like cardiac effects may not, since there is the possibility that steroid use hardens arteries and damages the muscle layer surrounding the heart.
The study, published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal, also found that those who developed steroid dependence shared similar backgrounds, including a single-parent home, an immediate relative with an addiction, and no college degree. 
People who become dependent on anabolic steroids are also more at risk of being dependent on another drug, in particular opiates, said Pope.
Studies with hamsters have revealed that when given an unlimited amount of testosterone, hamsters will dose themselves repeatedly until they die, as with opiate drugs. 
Interestingly enough, when hamsters were given opiate blockers, they were not susceptible to dying from an excess of testosterone injections. 
Although no conclusions can be drawn from this fact, the next most important step is to do further research, according to Pope.
Pope said he hopes that his study inspires others and raises awareness about anabolic steroids since so little is known about them. 
“Doctors know a lot about alcohol problems and addiction to profitable street drugs, but they know little about anabolic steroids, they’re poorly understood,” he said. “This is an area where [the scientific community] needs to be educated as this problem comes over the horizon.”For recent research, faculty profiles, and a look at the issues facing Harvard scientists, check out The Crimson's science page.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first third of his medical career, Thomas P. Stossel says he was your “typical academic socialist”—buried in research and clinical work.
He won recognition for discovering the sixth most common protein in the blood in 1979 and has spent 30 years trying to unravel its function.
But outside his speciality of hematology, Stossel—who heads the Translational Medicine Division at Harvard affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital—is known for something far more controversial than the protein “filamin A.”
Amid a wave of new regulations regarding physician-industry ties, Stossel has stood largely alone as a vocal and vehement opponent of new oversight at the Medical School, where he says administrators have blindly accepted new rules to quiet recent controversies over such relationships.
Concerns about industry ties—which have gathered steam nationwide in recent years—erupted at the Medical School last fall after students protested what they alleged were undisclosed and unethical conflicts of interest in their classes, drawing national media attention.
But Stossel says the media coverage, which helped prompt new policies at some of Harvard’s largest affiliated hospitals, was off base and ignored the positive contributions of industry—and he hasn’t kept those opinions to himself.
He argues that the current activism is not supported by the data—citing a small survey reporting that 80 percent of patients do not care if their physicians have pharmaceutical companies ties—and that maligning industry investment will only inhibit scientific progress.
But those stances have drawn fire from many of Stossel’s colleagues, who say academic medicine has long suffered from ethical breeches because ties to industry have gone unregulated, and that Stossel’s statements ignore the potential for bias introduced by industry involvement.
“Rather than take on our central premise, he says how indispensable industry is to churning out new products,” says David J. Rothman, who directs the center for the Study of Science and Medicine at Columbia University. “What we are saying is that you need to make sure there are firewalls between industry and medicine.”
But Stossel says that in the rush to quell protest at Harvard Medical School, the interests of physicians and industry have been brushed aside—preventing open debate and key stakeholders from having any say in the policies.
Now, with new regulations at some Harvard hospitals and a Massachusetts state law going into effect this July that ban gifts and requires public disclosure of all industry funding over $50, Stossel says he hopes there will be a backlash from affected physicians.
“Now there’s some skin in the game,” he says. “It’s an opportunity to politely suggest some things that might be changed.”
‘PHARMASCOLDS’
Stossel says he first learned about industry’s impact on the medical profession after joining the advisory board of Biogen Idec Inc., a Cambridge biotechnology company.
Despite their contribution to science, Stossel says his colleagues’ practices at Biogen would have violated current conflict of interest codes today.
About the time he joined Biogen’s board, there was an incident at the Harvard affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary that he says precipitated the movement to combat conflict of interest in medicine.
Stossel says he was disturbed by the portrayal of the event, and that reality was being hijacked—so he decided to start educating himself about the issues.
“For 20 years, I just read all the books, and fumed and fussed,” he says.
He says that after the Los Angeles Times blasted some of his colleagues, and the National Institutes of Health imposed a blanket ban on consulting, he decided to come out and write his first op-ed defending industry’s role in medicine.
And as his own hospital has put in place more stringent regulations, he has continued his advocacy, fascinated, he says, by the “quasi-religious” coterie of advocates who catapulted conflict of interest issues into the spotlight.
But he adds that those in favor of regulation retain the upper-hand because the path of least resistance for academic leadership is to try to curb dissent—which he says explains the changes at Harvard’s affiliates.
“If there is a big ruckus going on, and the students are running amuck, and the media is hyping it up, and Senator Grassley is nosing around, all you care about is quieting this down,“ he says
And he said that he never hears from the “pharmascolds,” despite frequently criticizing them in public, who he says prefer to present the issue as if there is no dissent.
“I’m not a total nutcase,” he says. “I’m not saying that the world is flat or that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS—I think I have data and logic—it’s contrarian logic, but it’s logic.”
‘DEMONIZING INDUSTRY’
While his opponents certainly agree Stossel’s arguments are contrarian, not all consider them grounded in logic.
Rothman, the Columbia professor, says that Stossel is the master of the “straw man” argument, constructing the rationale for conflict of interest regulations to aid his position.
“He makes it out like we are demonizing industry,” Rothman says. 
Rothman says that Stossel bases his attacks on the movement on a misinterpretation that its supporters seek the abolishment of pharmaceutical and drug device relationships in medicine—a charge he called absurd.
“What we want is careful regulation of marking activities in industry,” he says. “We don’t want to put industry out of business, but we want to make sure their marketing activities are not conflated with their educational activities.”
In particular, he says that professional medical societies giving out bags and pens with drug companies names is a particularly egregious practice that merits heavy regulation.
“We don’t think that doctors should be walking advertisements for industry,” he says.
Though Stossel says biased medicine is in no one’s best interest, he disagrees with using regulation to prevent it, arguing that physicians should be free to determine on their own if the gift is a bribe.
But on physicians ghostwriting pharmaceutical studies—another contentious ethical issue—Stossel is not nearly so far from the medical mainstream, saying that honorary authorship, in which doctors simply sign their name to a document written by industry employees, is wrong.
But Stossel says such incidents are rare. And in keeping with his contrarian positions, Stossel says he has few qualms about less extreme forms of ghostwriting, in which big pharmaceutical companies hire professionals to write a draft of the findings from multi-million dollar clinical studies.
Harlan M. Krumholz, a professor of cardiology and public health at Yale, who has written extensively on ghostwriting, says that the degree to which he has seen ghostwriting and other distortion tactics used constitutes a major problem for medicine.
He adds that arguments like Stossel’s miss the purpose of conflict of interest regulation by perpetuating a false perception that physicians are either for or against pharmaceutical companies.
Krumholz says the debate is not about whether industry should be involved in medicine at all, but rather what interactions are ethical, a question the profession must answer if it is to retain patients’ confidence. 
“We have case after case of problems,” he says. “We need to restore trust and be transparent about these relationships.”
As Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier revisits Harvard policy, Stossel says, it is important to not overdo regulation to appease protesters.
He says he would like the rules to be like the constitution: simple. “Let’s get data, lets be flexible,” he says. “If people do bad things, shoot them. The rules we have now are as if you couldn’t have a car that ever exceeds the speed limit.”
Stossel adds he is not holding his breath for policy he finds acceptable, but he feels that the Dean is trying to be reasonable.
“I hope the message will get across that has to be done in a different way,” he says. “You will never please the critics.... You cannot please everybody and cure cancer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A male graduate student was allegedly attacked while walking on Putnam Avenue at approximately 9:25 p.m. Wednesday, according to a community advisory e-mail issued yesterday morning by the Harvard University Police Department. The attack was allegedly part of an attempted armed robbery.  According to the advisory, the assailant approached the student from a driveway, struck him in the head, and tried to take his backpack, which contained his laptop computer.  Although the student was initially able to run away, the suspect caught up to him at the corner of Flagg Street and Putnam Avenue, according to the advisory. The assailant then revealed a handgun, after which the victim dropped his backpack and ran away.The student was not injured in the incident, the advisory said.  The Cambridge Police Department is investigating the incident because it did not occur on Harvard University property.  HUPD sent a community advisory e-mail yesterday morning to all students, faculty, and staff at Harvard’s Cambridge Campus, and to some at the Longwood campus, according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.The e-mail is the second of its kind to be sent out this week, before which no advisories had been sent out since September.Students expressed concern about the recent crimes on campus. “There’s certainly reason to be vigiliant and aware,” said Alexander E. McNaughton ’11.The department sends advisories directly to Harvard College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, as well as the deans of the schools, department public affairs officers, and the Director of News and Public Affairs for the University. They also ask representatives to post the advisories in conspicuous locations on campus in addition to electronically forwarding them widely to students, faculty and staff.  Prior to yesterday’s, the last advisory was sent out this Tuesday, detailing an attempted robbery that had occurred in the Science Center plaza. Since 2007, ten such community advisories have been issued by the police department. CPD public information officials could not be reached Thursday evening.—Staff writer Marianna N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many College alums, Gustavo A. Espada ’96 has tried to remain active in the Harvard community. But instead of contributing to the University’s coffers or participating in Harvard Clubs across the country, Espada has taken a less conventional and perhaps more controversial route. 
For the past two years, the former Quincy House resident has protested outside the Science Center with his trademark black bag and poster calling into question the American government’s account of the events of September 11, 2001. 
He has become something of a landmark, a geographic reference point for people on campus.
Espada chuckles as he recounts overhearing a cell phone conversation in which a passer-by said, “Oh yeah, I’m outside Mem Hall, right outside the Science Center, where 9/11 Guy is.”
But unlike a static landmark, the nature of Espada’s presence in Harvard Square has evolved over the years. From handing out fake dollar bills with the addresses of 9/11 truth movement Web sites—while wearing a horse mask—to adopting the subtler approach of sitting outside with his poster, Espada remains a symbol of dissidence in Cambridge.
But Espada says he thinks his current mode of activism needs an upgrade. When the weather improves, Espada says he will unveil his latest tool: an enormous banner. The banner is so cumbersome that Espada says he will only start using it regularly once the April winds die down so that he can display it without fear of it blowing away.
His original companions in protest have whichever way the winds blow, he’ll still be protesting.
PAST
The man who would become “the 9/11 Guy” says he never participated in any sort of protest until after college. 
A native of Puerto Rico, Espada and his family moved from place to place throughout the Americas because of Espada’s father’s job in the Department of State. 
“I learned to be a little bit skeptical from my dad, to understand that you can believe in your country and work for your country without having to accept everything that the government does,” he says.
Espada attended high school in Maryland, where he excelled in the classroom and on the tennis court.
Eduardo J. Espada, Gustavo’s brother who works as a professional illustrator in the Boston area, says that he and his family were not particularly surprised when his brother was accepted to Harvard College.
The future sociology concentrator says that his academic experience as a Harvard undergraduate had an influence on his disbelief of the U.S. government’s report of 9/11. Espada says that he learned a great deal about conspiracies in such classes as Political Sociology as well as Organizational Sociology.
But Espada says that instead of focusing primarily on academics, while in college, he spent much more time making friends and getting to know people.
A former freshman entryway-mate, Aristarchus Patrinos ’96, says he fondly remembers one of the Espada’s social escapades.
“Everybody was kind of stressed out because of finals and papers, so Gus went out and built [an igloo.] He really made a name for himself on campus that way,” said Patrinos. 
Another entryway-mate, and later a Quincy blockmate of Espada’s, Martin J. Son ’96, says that he remembers eating pizza in the igloo while Espada entertained a chilly audience by playing guitar.
Espada says that he also spent a fair amount of his time working at the Language Lab, which was housed in Boylston Hall at the time. 
His then-supervisor at the Lab, Connie J. Christo, says that she remembers Espada having many positive qualities, including diligence and modesty.
“He was not at all filled with himself,” said Christo.
PRESENT
It was the summer after the U.S. invasion of Iraq that Espada first began his activism. He joined the small movement of people openly skeptical of the government’s explanation for 9/11. But he says this was not without hesitation.
“I was not ready to believe that this was all a big lie, as cynical as I was,” he says.
But Espada says that things took a turn when he began to notice what he considers inconsistencies in the official account of 9/11.
The Harvard grad began protesting with a Boston-based 9/11 truth group that used to gather in Harvard Square every Saturday, handing out literature and occasionally wearing animal costumes to attract attention.
Although the group no longer convenes weekly in the Square, Espada says he considers his presence on campus to be a continuation of the group’s activity.
He says that he enjoys his current location in front of the Science Center. It allows him to protest during his lunch breaks as financial and systems coordinator for the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations. 
He also says he just enjoys the pleasantness of sitting outside on sunny spring and summer days.
But Espada’s activism has not always gone smoothly.
Espada recounts one event that he found particularly shocking, which occurred during an otherwise routine visit to the Holyoke Center to deliver financial documents for his job. He was carrying one of his 9/11 posters and says that as he was leaving the building, a security guard stopped him and requested that he never return to the Center again. 
Espada says that he felt indignant after hearing that the reason he was stopped was that a security guard disagreed with his views on 9/11.
“Look, I realize that what I’m doing on campus may be a bit disturbing to some people, but it’s still totally unacceptable to be singled out, constantly and consistently,” he says.
Espada says that run-ins such as this with people including administrators and students, have motivated him to extensively research the laws and policies protecting free speech on campus. He says that one of his preferred modes of dealing with threats to his rights is speaking with University Ombudsman Lydia Cummings.
Espada’s brother Eduardo maintains that his sibling has never flagged in his determination to change his community’s views on 9/11.
“I’m proud of him. He has for many years stuck to his beliefs. I can remember when [they] first started taking root, and [they’ve] never waned since,” he says.
FUTURE
Yet Espada says he worries that others in the 9/11 truth movement might not remain as consistent as he, due to much of the nation’s positive response to the Obama administration.
“When you have an administration that is perceived as much better than the previous one, it takes a lot of the wind out of the sails of any dissenting voices,” he says. 
Aside from planning on regularly displaying his recently acquired banner—which the weather has not yet allowed him to do—Espada says that he has little in the way of ideas for changes from his current routine.
“As much as I like to keep it fresh, it’s more important to keep it consistent,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In February, Harvard announced an early retirement incentive package for staff members. Now, the faculty may be next.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Office for Faculty Affairs is collaborating with the Provost’s Office to explore implementing a retirement incentive package for faculty members, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in an interview yesterday.
Although the details still need to be ironed out, the program is well into the planning stages, and some professors surmise that such a program may be a prelude to a longer-term shrinking of the Faculty.
“The Faculty grew a lot in the last five years, so I presume they’ll let it shrink a bit,” said English professor Louis Menand. “Faculty salaries can be a quite big chunk of the budget.”
Now that the deadline for FAS staffers to accept their retirement incentive packages has passed, University spokesman Kevin Galvin wrote in an e-mailed statement that “University officials are beginning to take up the question of a faculty program in earnest.” 
Galvin added that it is still too early to tell whether a potential faculty retirement incentive program would be University-wide or restricted to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“My understanding is that there’s going to be very few searches in the next few years and that we don’t have a model in FAS of automatic replacing in the same field when somebody vacates,” said history professor Andrew D. Gordon, who is on the Faculty Council, which discussed the possibility of a faculty retirement incentive package at their Wednesday meeting.
Some professors who are considering retirement are concerned that in the current economic climate, there is no guarantee that a ladder faculty member would replace them.
Gisela Striker—the philosophy department’s only specialist in ancient philosophy—recently submitted her plan to retire at the end of next year and said she has already “given up” on seeking a replacement.
The department already had a short list of professors they were considering to replace her, she said—but Smith froze the search.
She said that not replacing professor vacancies has the potential to do serious harm to FAS by restricting opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to work closely with faculty.
“I’m not convinced that the University would really stand to save a lot of money without really doing harm to what they call their main aim and commitment—namely continuing to promote education and research,” Striker said.
Over half of the FAS budget, Smith emphasized at the town hall meeting and in yesterday’s interview, is people costs—compensation for staffers and professors.
Harvard professors are currently the highest paid in the country, according to a recent report by the American Association of University Professors, with an average salary of $192,600 per year.
Smith said at the FAS town hall meeting earlier this month that he is not considering salary reductions for professors or upper-level administrators as a possibility because with the current salary freeze, “we’ve all taken a real pay cut.”
After the federal mandatory retirement law—which permitted Universities to force professors to retire at the age of 70—was repealed in 1994, the Harvard Faculty has slowly aged.
No matter how appealing the package may be, getting professors to retire will be more difficult than it sounds.
Economics professor Lawrence F. Katz said yesterday that although there is currently an informal rule for professors to voluntarily retire at the age of 70, that may change in the current economic climate in which many have lost a substantial portion of their retirement savings.
He added that it might be a detriment for FAS if older professors stay on for too long, preventing young junior professors from being hired.
Several professors also said that their colleagues’ love for their work might make it less likely for them to opt for early retirement.
“I don’t see any of them being that interested in [a retirement incentive package],” classics professor Richard F. Thomas said of his colleagues in the department. “They all enjoy teaching and research. That’s basically what the job is about, so if you can get paid for that, why retire?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scientists at Harvard’s Center for Astrophysics are celebrating the discovery of the smallest known exoplanet—a planet orbiting a star other than the Sun—announced Tuesday by European astronomers.The new planet, Gliese 581 e, is 1.9 times the size of Earth and 80 times smaller than the first exoplanet, which was discovered in 1995. The solar system where the planet was found is 20.5 light years away and can be found in the constellation Libra.Members of the CFA, which has played a major role in the search for exoplanets, heralded the discovery as momentous.“This discovery can be compared to what happened 400 years ago with Galileo’s discovery of Jupiter’s moons,” said Dimitar Sasselov, a professor of astronomy. “It is amazing that it happened on the 400th anniversary of Galileo’s discovery.”At the Center, many scientists are heavily involved with exoplanet research. Harvard astrophysicists have developed one of the most “exciting” techniques in the search for exoplanets, known as the transit method, which is currently being utilized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Kepler Mission, Sasselov said.NASA’s Kepler telescope is designed to find Earth-like planets around other stars. “Harvard is very much involved [with Kepler], providing the scientific backing for the mission,” said Sasselov.Scientists said that they are optimistic about Kepler’s potential to uncover more planets beyond our Solar System.“Kepler may actually detect Earth-like planets,” said CFA scientist Scott J. Kenyon, who added that the search for Earth-like planets is a major goal of exoplanet research.“We’re trying to find lower and lower mass planets that are more and more similar to the earth,” Kenyon said. Harvard’s new Origins of Life Initiative will bring together research in exoplanets and other areas of physical science with research in the life sciences, according to Sasselov.Students interested in this topic have the option of learning more from courses such as Science A-54: Life as a Planetary Phenomenon and the recently approved course Astronomy 110: Exoplanets.

In response to the recent brouhaha over the College's opaque-sounding process for making J-Term housing decisions next year, Dean Evelynn Hammonds has released another missive "to address questions that have arisen."
You know, questions like Will I get housing? and Will I get food? and, uh, Who do I need to bribe for those things to happen?
But never fear, confused student. This e-mail clears everything up.
So... I guess we know where to send the money now?

The prefrosh are finally here! And with a reportedly record turnout and the normally schizophrenic April weather at near-Stanford levels of balmy (compared to Yale's rainy weekend), the Admissions Office must be expecting a boost in yield. Unless their admits value a place to sleep.
Yes, just a day before the prefrosh were slated to arrive, undergrads were bombarded by emails yesterday begging them to help host the overwhelming number of prefrosh visiting campus.  With pleading subjects such as "Please Help! We Need More Prefrosh Hosts!" and the rather more concise "SOS," admissions officers and proctors implored students to open their rooms to rising freshmen.
More begging, after the jump.
"The Admissions Office is in dire need for more hosts," one email said. Another urged girls in particular to help out, as apparently there is a shortage of female hosts. Yet another, which stated that the Visiting Program had its largest attendance ever this year at 1,100 prefrosh, asked students already signed up to host if they would take in more students. What better way to get a taste of Harvard's trademark overcrowding? If FlyBy had n+1 (and an unreasonable amount of time to waste), we'd totally volunteer to host!
The emails, which were sent as late as 10:47 p.m. last night, caused confusion among several undergrads who said they had signed up to host prefrosh, but hadn't been assigned any.
Prefrosh could already be seen roaming the campus today, their painfully identifiable red folders in hand.  Whether they'll all have a bed this weekend, or even a futon, remains unclear. The Admissions Office did not return request for comment this afternoon.
