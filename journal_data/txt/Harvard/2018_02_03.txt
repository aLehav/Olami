After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Large crowds and the scent of freshly brewed coffee filled Bow Street as students and Cantabrigians waited in line to sample Blue Bottle Coffee’s free drinks on the cafe's opening day Friday.
The coffee shop officially opened its doors months later than expected. The Oakland, Calif.-based franchise first announced its new location near Harvard Square in Dec. 2016; at the time, Blue Bottle representatives said the store planned to open for business in summer 2017.
For the duration of the day Friday, Blue Bottle—located at 40 Bow Street—offered customers a free drink of their choice from its menu of drip coffee and espresso drinks. Customers could also purchase pastries or sandwiches, with all proceeds going to Boston-based charity organization Artists for Humanity.
Students who stopped by said they were impressed by the store’s open decor and tasty coffee.
“I really like that it has a lot of windows. It feels very bright and cheery,” Grace C. Eysenbach ’20 said.
Rick Li ’21, another student at Friday’s event and an active Crimson editor, also said he enjoyed the feel of the coffee shop.
“I love it. I love the ambience,” Li said.
In an interview Friday, Blue Bottle CEO Bryan Meehan cited what he called Cambridge's "numerous" city regulations as the primary reason the coffee shop took longer to open than expected.
“There’s a lot of delays that happen in the sign offs with the city so it’s been like an 18 month journey getting it done. But, you know, good things are worth waiting for,” Meehan said. “I think Cambridge prides itself on preserving the greatness of the community so we’re very respectful of that. And, you know, we’re gonna be here for a long time.”
Blue Bottle Coffee enters a Harvard Square market chock-full of caffeine competitors including Starbucks, Crema Cafe, JP Licks, and Tatte. Despite abundant competition, Meehan said he has faith that Blue Bottle will attract plenty of business.
“We like to say we serve delicious coffee. It might take a little longer because we make every single cup by hand,” Meehan said. “So it’s a longer process but I think if you’re interested in learning more about coffee, this is not a company that processes its products. It’s a craft here.”
Though coffee tasters on Friday said they generally liked their drinks, some took issue with the store’s higher prices.
“Black coffee is more expensive here than other places,” Courtney DeLong ’21 said. “That’s usually what I drink and I’m not trying to spend another dollar every day."
Other customers did not share DeLong's reservations. Cape Cod resident Kristi J. Regan—who said she drove up to Cambridge specifically for the coffee shop's opening day—said she is thrilled the coffee shop has come to Harvard.
“I love Blue Bottle,” Regan said. “I’m familiar with Blue Bottle Coffee so it’s exciting that they’re here finally."
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she is also pleased the coffee shop has finally opened.
“It’s been a long time coming,” Jillson said. “So exciting. You know, particularly for that area in the Square which tends to be a little quiet. It’s a beautiful building and a lovely space.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will hold a second election to determine whether eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants may unionize on April 18 and 19, the National Labor Relations Board announced Friday.
At stake in the upcoming election is whether eligible graduate teaching and research assistants and undergraduate course assistants will have the ability to collectively bargain with the University. Public Policy Ph.D. student and union advocate Niharika N. Singh said supporters of unionization are already mobilizing in preparation for the upcoming election.
"Harvard students are eager for the stability of a contract to continue their exceptional work as researchers and teachers. I can guarantee you that student-workers like myself across campus are circling April 18 on their calendars right now," Singh said.
University representatives could not be immediately reached for comment Friday evening.
The NLRB announcement follows over a year of legal battles between the University and Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers over the results of a Nov. 2016 unionization election.
The results of that election showed 1,526 votes against unionization and 1,396 in favor. Lawyers representing HGSU-UAW contested the initial results on the grounds that the University did not properly generate a required list of eligible voters.
In July 2017, the regional NLRB ruled in favor of HSGU-UAW, saying the University-generated list was inadequate. Harvard then appealed the ruling, taking the case to the federal board in Washington, D.C. The national board ultimately reaffirmed the original decision, ruling against the University in December.
The NLRB’s Boston office ordered the upcoming election in January, after the 2016 results were finalized.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y.—A lack of offense down the stretch coupled with a scalding hot second half by Columbia doomed the Harvard men’s basketball team on Friday night as the Crimson fell to the Lions, 83-76, in New York City. Despite a career-high 31 points from sophomore forward Seth Towns and a 15-point first half lead, a post-intermission stretch that saw the Lions make nine straight field goals ultimately proved to be the difference. The loss was Harvard’s first in conference play and further muddled the Ivy League’s postseason picture.
Many of the same themes that have been present for the Crimson (9-11, 4-1 Ivy League) over its last several games were on display on Friday night—Harvard jumped out to a large lead early in the first half, allowed Columbia (5-13, 2-3) back into the contest before intermission, and offset offensive spells by going cold from the field for long stretches.
For the first time in conference play this season, however, the formula resulted in defeat for the Crimson. A week after not making a field goal in the game’s final 4:56 against Yale and still managing to win, converting just three in the final 7:09 of its matchup against the Lions proved to be too big of a hurdle for Harvard to overcome.
“I thought that Columbia played incredibly well, especially when we had a sizable lead there early and they really dug in and got back into it in the first half,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought that was a big key in that we weren’t able to sustain that march that we had early.”
While defense tends to be the Crimson’s calling card and three-point shooting the thorn in its side, the script was largely flipped on Friday evening. Harvard shot 43 percent from beyond the arc—nailing 16 triples in the process—but struggled to get stops for most of the contest. Towns followed up his career night from last Saturday against Brown with arguably a better performance in New York.
After attacking the rim and converting on midrange jumpers in dismantling the Bears, the sophomore showed off his three-point shooting touch for the 2,010 fans in attendance, making six of nine triple attempts. Towns only turned the ball over twice and had 26 of his the Crimson’s first 49 points. Through five Ivy League contests, the Columbus, Ohio native is averaging 22.8 points per game.
“I think we a good job generally sticking to our principles and how we play on offense,” Towns said. “I’m out there to do whatever we need to do to make a play and score. In terms of playing my game, I don’t think that their pace was disrupting that.”
After Towns helped his team establish an early lead that topped out at 15, Harvard struggled to maintain a torrid scoring pace that was characterized by sharing the basketball and hitting open jump shots. The Lions went on an 11-0 run and ended the first half riding a 22-13 burst that put its deficit at a mere six. After not committing a single turnover in the game’s first 11:32, the Crimson coughed the ball up four times over a 3:28 span late in the opening half.
Facing a Harvard team that prides itself on suffocating defense and slowing the pace on the other end, Columbia relished the opportunity to play offense in transition. The hosts turned the ball over just once and scored 22 points in the frame’s final 9:29 and held without a point for nearly four and a half minutes.
The second major power outage came not long after the first. After Towns pushed his point total to 23 (of the Crimson’s 46) less than two minutes into the second half, the Harvard offense went ice cold. Following Towns’ basket at the 18:34 mark, the Crimson would not score a single point again until 13:28 remained, missing all five of its field goal attempts in the process. Meanwhile, Columbia caught fire once again, shooting 6-of-11 from the field during a 17-5 run to start the frame. After recording just six assists in the entire first half, the Lions registered five on their first six made field goals of the second.
While senior guard Kyle Castlin largely kept the hosts in the game in the first half—12 points on four-of-four shooting off the bench—it was Columbia’s top two scorers who did the damage after the break.
Junior guard Quinton Adlesh made just one of his four first half field goal attempts but scored 13 of the Lions’ first 25 points after intermission and registered 17 points in a stretch that consumed less than eight minutes of game action. Columbia made nine consecutive field goals and saw its lead stand at nine with 9:18 to play. During the hot streak, sophomore guard Mike Smith also came alive, finishing the contest with 16 points after posting just two in the first half.
“We were trying to do different things to slow them down and they got into a nice rhythm running their offense and getting good shots,” Amaker said. “They made some against our zone, I thought they made some tough shots too. I thought a few of the shots we did all we could do, bodies there, hands up, and they still made some tough shots. We told our kids that we just need to keep our heads up.”
Columbia coach Jim Engles noted that Harvard sophomore forward Chris Lewis was the focal point of his team’s defensive gameplan entering the contest. While Lewis struggled with foul trouble last Saturday, he was largely the Crimson’s x-factor in its win over Yale a week ago. The sophomore is consistently a mismatch for Ivy League big men and is the main interior post presence in Amaker’s inside-out offense.
“We knew a lot of the stuff they do centers around him,” Engles said of Lewis. “They are a ball-screen heavy offense and we were really focused on making sure that he was contained as much as we could. I thought we did a good job keeping him off the glass as well.”
The Lions were successful in limiting Lewis (seven points and just five field goal attempts), and Harvard was unable to establish an inside game for most of the evening. Despite entering the bonus with 9:45 to play in the game, the Crimson only attempted four free throw attempts down the stretch.
For as much as it struggled down low, Harvard was able to make up for it and then some from beyond the arc. Towns and Johnson led the barrage for the guests, teaming up for 46 of the Crimson’s 76 points and shooting a combined 11-of-21 from long range. The hot shooting from deep was a far cry from the 30.7 percent mark that Harvard held entering the contest.
However, apart from Johnson, much of the Crimson’s backcourt struggled with efficiency from the field. Point guards Christian Juzang, Bryce Aiken, and Mario Haskett shot a combined 2-for-13. Sophomore wing Justin Bassey was two-for-six from the field and turned the ball over six times.
Despite the two lengthy Harvard droughts and simultaneous Columbia runs, perhaps the most frustrating part for the Crimson was that it was still largely in the contest when it went into its third cold spell. A Johnson three with 7:09 to play got Harvard to within two but its next points would not come until Bassey made a layup with 2:43 to play.
Towns would make another three, his sixth of the evening, and freshman forward Danilo Djuricic converted a layup in the closing seconds, but the Lions scored 14 of the night’s final 25 points to put the game on ice. All told, Columbia scored 48 points in the second half (on 60 percent shooting) and 73 over the game’s final 30 minutes, outscoring its guests by 22 in the process. The 83 points allowed were the most that the Crimson has given up since its 2015 trip to Morningside Heights.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball catapulted into first place in the Ivy League on the heels of an 85-67 domination of Columbia. Thanks to a 13-0 run late in the third quarter and a whopping 57 points in the paint, the Crimson (12-6, 4-1 Ivy) was able to pull away from the Lions (7-13, 1-4) to notch its fifth straight win, making Harvard 9-0 at home on the year.
“We had some beautiful leakouts and did a nice job getting it into Jeannie [Boehm],” Delaney-Smith said of the points in the paint. “I was pretty happy about that.”
A third quarter run separated the Crimson from its competition on Friday night. Following two scoreless minutes, junior guard Nani Redford extended Harvard’s lead back to nine with a transition three to make the game 57-48. Redford then found senior guard Taylor Rooks on a fastbreak, the latter hitting the layup to finish off the play. On the next two possessions, sophomore guard Katie Benzan and junior guard Sydney Skinner went back-to-back from beyond the arc to make the game 65-48 Crimson, forcing Columbia to call a timeout. Coming out of the timeout, the Lions hit a three-pointer to finally end Harvard’s run at 13 straight points. Skinner would answer with a layup before the buzzer to make the game 67-51 heading into the final quarter.
“That’s what we’re capable of,” Delaney-Smith said. “It doesn’t matter who scores, we have enough people who can score on many levels.”
The offensive glass proved important in the early going. The Crimson nabbed six offensive rebounds in the first quarter, while Columbia was unable to grab a single offensive board. This allowed the home team to account for 11 second chance points in the opening period alone, a big reason for its 27-18 lead going into the second quarter.
The Lions’ deficiencies under their own basket showed again in the second quarter, as Harvard junior co-captain Madeline Raster grabbed her own rebound on the other side of the basket following a missed jumper from the baseline. The second time was good enough, as she converted on her own second chance by hitting the layup on the opposite block to make the score 36-25 Crimson halfway through the second period.
Although both teams had a hard time finding the bottom of the net early, the offenses came alive midway through the first quarter. With 6:06 left in the first period, Harvard led 4-2. Exactly two minutes later when the Crimson called its first timeout, the score was 15-12. Rooks found her stroke, hitting two straight three-pointers. Columbia answered with two threes of its own, but Benzan tilted the scales back to Harvard with yet another three-pointer. Benzan would finish the game with a team-high 20 points.
After the two teams traded 5-0 runs, senior co-captain Kirby Porter answered a Lions three-pointer with a three of her own. The teams continued to trade baskets, keeping the score difference at 11 points with only 30 seconds left in the half. Following a bucket by sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm, Columbia was able to finally strike on the offensive glass with its last possession of the half. Despite the Lions grabbing two offensive rebounds on this final possession, the Crimson denied a buzzer-beating basket both times as the clock ticked down, making the score 46-33 at the half.
“We just blew by them and got into the paint really easily,” Benzan said. “We have so many threats on the outside and attacking the rim on the inside.”
Harvard continued its dominance of the paint into the second half, starting off with three layups and a block from Boehm. Columbia, however, was able to keep up by knocking down four threes and two jump shots in the first four minutes of the half to cut its deficit to four, 52-48 Crimson.
“It was never in jeopardy in my opinion,” Delaney-Smith said.
Coming off of its huge third quarter run, Harvard sped up the pace in the fourth quarter with early fast break layups by Redford and Skinner to extend the lead to twenty points. The Crimson managed to cruise the rest of the way, eliciting cheers for Harvard President Drew G. Faust, who was honored at the start of the game, to enter the contest. Unfortunately, Faust did not see any playing time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a tight second period, the Harvard men’s hockey team led Dartmouth, 2-1, with less than four minutes to go in regulation. With time ticking down, the game grew chippier as the Big Green pressed on in search of the tying goal.
The puck bounced around the neutral zone before junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage corralled it and found the tape of linemate Ryan Donato, who had drifted all alone behind the Dartmouth defense.
The precision-pass gave Donato the time and space he needed. Coming down the slot, he moved to his backhand and flipped the biscuit bar-down on senior netminder Devin Buffalo. The Scituate, Mass., native and his linemates barely celebrated the late tally, though the third goal was certainly significant.
“It was just relief,” Donato recalled. “I didn’t even have the time to celebrate. I was just like, ‘finally.’”
Friday night, the Crimson (10-8-4, 9-5-3 ECAC) skated to a 4-1 win over Dartmouth (9-12-2, 7-8-1), although relief—rather than excitement—seemed to be the tone of the triumph. After Harvard failed to score in two contests last weekend, the team’s offense began the road to recovery in Hanover, N.H.
Donato himself, the NCAA’s leading goal-scorer (21), had been operating at over a goal per game before last weekend’s goose eggs.
Of the four times the Crimson tickled the twine against the Big Green, only Donato’s was a top-line effort—another promising sign for the team, which will soon lose its scoring leader to the American Olympic squad. The bottom six made the difference in this game, going hard to the net and forcing Buffalo to make some scrambling saves.
“A lot of guys are going to have to start stepping up,” freshman forward Benjamin Solin said. “[Donato] being gone is going to give a lot of opportunities [to] some other guys.”
Solin opened the scoring, deflecting a left-point shot from sophomore defenseman John Marino just 3:58 into the tilt. Though Harvard outshot Dartmouth, 19-6, in the first frame, the visitors could only build a 1-0 lead before the intermission.
“In the first, I thought their goalie played great,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “Unfortunately, that’s been a theme for us. I thought we could’ve had three or four in the first pretty easily.”
Despite the free-flowing first frame, the game tightened up in the second, as it took more than half of the middle period for either team to strike. This time, it was the Big Green’s turn.
Rookie forward Quin Foreman carried the puck up the left wing and fired a shot that trickled through Crimson tri-captain Merrick Madsen into the blue paint. Sophomore Shane Sellar poked the loose puck home in the confusion. Though the game was closest in the middle frame, that tally would be the only goal Madsen let in all night.
“I felt solid. That’s kind of the game I’m trying to get back to,” Madsen said. “We got back into the win column, and that’s what mattered tonight.”
A few minutes after Sellar’s tying goal, a chip from Harvard sophomore forward Nathan Krusko sprang his linemates, sophomore Frédéric Grégoire and freshman Jack Badini, on a 2-on-1. Grégoire flew up the left wing and picked his corner, beating Buffalo with a far-side snipe. Harvard had regained the lead and would not relinquish it again.
Late in the final frame and shortly after Donato’s breakaway goal, senior defenseman Wiley Sherman hit Dartmouth’s empty net from 190 feet away, sealing the win.
Coach Donato shuffled the lines in advance of Friday night, reuniting last year’s top defensive duo of Sherman and Marino, both of whom had points in the game. The familiar pairings kept the Big Green in check for the most part, aside from a few 2-on-1 chances in the second frame where Madsen was able to make the stop.
A return to form for the senior netminder, who turned away 22 of 23 shots, would prove a timely boon for the Crimson as it looks ahead to Monday’s Beanpot matchup. In addition to Madsen’s solid play (.957 SV%), the team also benefited from the penalty kill, which saw a bounce-back performance on Friday evening. The man-down unit went a perfect 3-for-3 after conceding both Colgate goals in last Saturday’s 2-0 loss.
“I think it was a really solid team effort,” Madsen said. “There are some things we still want to work on, but we’re starting to get back on track.”
One of those pieces that could still use refining is Harvard’s power play. The unit is scoreless in its last 12 opportunities, going from a 27.3% execution rate in December to 9.4% in January. As the team prepares to face BU at TD Garden, the possible return of freshman forward Henry Bowlby or the Terriers’ lackluster shorthanded squad (78.2%) could provide the jump that the Crimson’s extra-man group needs.
