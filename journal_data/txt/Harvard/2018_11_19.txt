After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The heist film genre is often one defined by wish fulfillment. Films like “Now You See Me,” “Inception,” and “Ocean’s 11” have helped set the standard for the contemporary caper: The overly charismatic, smarter-than-you-could-ever-hope-to-be protagonist anchors an action-heavy thrill ride with a notable set piece, humor, and a persistently adventurous tone. It would appear that one of the main goals for director Steve McQueen with “Widows” is to deconstruct the heist film, from the expected narrative conventions to the degree of social relevance such films can maintain.
The film’s initial premise is sellable and engaging: It sees the widows of four high-level burglars forced to finish off their husbands’ final job after they’re murdered in action. It’s in the development of the titular widows, though, that the movie truly shines. Viola Davis stars as Veronica Rawlins, the widow who comes up with the idea to carry out her husband’s five million dollar heist and becomes the de facto head of the group of women who work to pull it off. As is often the case, Davis delivers a beguiling, nuanced performance: She expertly exhibits the pain of a woman left financially and emotionally compromised by the loss of her husband, and the unimaginable toll of carrying out her late partner’s plans. And this is not to deemphasize the work of the film’s other leading women, including a stoic yet layered performance by Michelle Rodriguez as Linda Perelli, and a realistic look at battered womanhood through Elizabeth Debicki’s Alice Gunner. The first-rate work from the all-star cast enrichens the film from its outset.
“Widows” is not just a heist film — it is a heist film made distinctly for modern day audiences. While this statement might seem obvious, it is still an important distinction to make. “Widows” holds a light up to problems currently facing American citizens: Racial tension, police brutality, and sexism are subtly highlighted and expertly portrayed. McQueen refuses to indulge in the escapist fantasies promoted by previous theatrical heists. The “Ocean”’s franchise might be the most egregious such example, itself delivering an all-female led caper earlier this year. “Ocean’s 8,” starring the likes of Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, and Anne Hathaway, opened last June to a sizable box office (nearly $300 million worldwide) but middling reviews from critics, many critiquing its lack of stakes, incongruous tone, and generally unrealistic narrative. “Widows,” despite coming out the same year, works as a sort of reaction piece: McQueen adds greater depth to his film by presenting it as an affecting character study first, and a heist thriller second.
McQueen’s inventive directorial hand, too, effortlessly elevates the picture, delivering shot after shot that heighten otherwise mundane scenes. One such instance occurs after Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), a sleazy local politician on the campaign trail who is the target of the heist, angrily rants to his secretary after being grilled by a reporter during a stop at a low-income community. As he raves ceaselessly about the reporter and state of the neighborhood while being driven back home, McQueen chooses not to depict the actual conversation. Instead, McQueen takes his shot outside of the car and focuses on the neighborhood in question, presenting a slow, consistent shot of the district and its gradual gentrification as they arrive to Mulligan’s house. This transgressive directorial choice immediately provides two ways of interpreting the scene: the present conversation and the neighborhood as it actually exists.
The film’s variety of twists and turns similarly maintain consistent audience engagement. The screenplay, co-penned by McQueen and “Gone Girl” scribe Gillian Flynn, is relentless in its efforts to subvert audience expectations. The film’s marketing, for example, leads viewers to assume the four widows taking on the job to be Davis, Rodriguez, Debicki, and Cynthia Erivo, the movie’s top-billed actresses. It’s made clear early on that this is the film’s first subversion, with the fourth widow actually being played by Carrie Coon. Erivo’s Belle character is actually a single mother working as the babysitter to Linda’s children, and not a titular widow. So what is the role of the fourth widow? And how does Erivo fit into the broader narrative? You’d have to check out the film to find out.
Steve McQueen’s “Widows” is an exercise in denial in all the best ways. He denies audiences the escapist fantasy they’ve come to expect from heist films. He denies viewers their preconceived notions for his film specifically through various twists. Essentially, he denies the fact that there is a conventional path for heist movies by charting a new one entirely. With strong performances, innovative direction, and unflinching social commentary, “Widows” positions itself as the definitive heist film of 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

On Sep. 26 2018, CollegeHumor announced the launch of its new subscription-based streaming service, Dropout.tv. The decision of the popular comedy Youtube channel, known for skits like “What If Google Was a Guy,” “Gay Men Will Marry Your Girlfriends,” and “The Problem with Jeggings” reflects a growing trend among internet comedy producers to move away from original online content as advertisers and media platform companies such as Facebook and Youtube start to exert greater control over digital media. This media centralization has already driven other internet comedy producers to extinction, such as FunnyorDie, which moved from online to long-form television and branded content, Smosh, who’s parent company Defy Media shut down, and Cracked, which reverted to its original focus on written content. Often these moves result in massive layoffs of talented web creators.
But CollegeHumor seems to be trying to buck against the trend as it attempts to take its internet producers along with it by launching this new streaming venture. The subscription-based service is tiered, costing $3.99 per month for all subscribers until Dec. 26 and then being $47.88 for an annual ($3.99 per month); $29.94 for a six-month subscription ($4.99 per month); or $5.99 for a monthly subscription. They argue the added cost helps the company make better content without having to adjust to the demands of advertisers. At the same time, the company has promised to continue to make quality free Youtube content for its existing channel. Over one month later, has the Youtube-channel-turned-Netflix kept its promises? The service has released five Dropout exclusive series: “Fantasy High,” “See Plum Run,” “Cartoon Hell,” “Um, Actually,” and “Lonely and Horny,” in addition to a number of webcomics and chat experiences. Here’s how they score.
“See Plum Run”
After a scandal, beauty queen pageant contestant Plum (Elaine Carroll) and her Mama (Josh Ruben) leave the Southern country for life in upper-class New England. This sequel to the Honey Boo Boo parody series, extremely popular on the CollegeHumor youtube channel in 2013, has been one of the most publicized projects of Dropout.tv. Unfortunately, it's not worth the hype. While the premise is intriguing, Ruben and Carroll are lackluster in their portrayal of Plum and her Mama, often relying on stereotypes or gag humor to land jokes. It’s the minor roles, such as Brian (Grant O’Brien), the political science grad student that Plum and her Mama believe is a ghost, that keep the comedy alive. A far cry from a laugh-out-loud sitcom, “See Plum Run” does manage to draw out a few impish smiles.
“Um, Actually”
CollegeHumor’s biggest game show host Mike Trapp brings nerdy CollegeHumor cast members and celebrity special guests to compete to be the ultimate expert on all types of fandom. The show is niche but fun. Regular subscribers to CollegeHumor will be excited to see the actors they’ve come to know and love in a personal and unscripted lens.
“Lonely and Horny”
This Jake and Amir production has a lot of potential. The most similar to an actual network TV series among the Dropout.tv projects, “Lonely and Horny” follows the rich and self-obsessed Ruby Jade’s (Amir Blumenfeld) quest to find love with the help of his dating coach Josh Rice (Jake Hurwitz). The show stands out due to Blumenfeld and Hurwitz’ excellent writing and performance. Ruby Jade’s self-righteousness and desperation make for a great protagonist that audiences will both hate and love.
“Cartoon Hell”
After an unwise deal with the TV Devil for a cartoon show that featured their art, cartoonists Caldwell Tanner and Nathan Yaffe find themselves in Hell, forced to produce cartoon shows for a demonic TV executive. Given a weird and wacky prompt for a show to create, the two creators brainstorm and make witty comments in realtime as they bring the animation to life. For people interested in watching the creative processes behind the animation, “Cartoon Hell” is the perfect match. However, at around 20 minutes per episode, the show’s simple draw and talk format doesn’t keep the attention of more mainstream viewers.
“Fantasy High”
At the top of Dropout.tv’s projects is “Fantasy High.” The “Dungeon and Dragons” live-action roleplay is a brilliant showcase of improvised comedy that is at the core of CollegeHumor. Led by Dungeon Master Brennan Lee Mulligan, who is often undervalued in CollegeHumor's original Youtube content, current and former members of CollegeHumor’s cast embark on an epic quest to get through high school alive. Along with a well-detailed and expensive set, the comic gold of the cast interactions and the novelty of the challenges their characters face make the hour and a half per episode worth it. On the other hand, the format of the project and the enormous time cost makes this a show that only a niche audience will enjoy.
By launching Dropout.tv, CollegeHumor entered an already crowded field. Hulu, HBO, Netflix, Amazon already dominate, and a number of services ranging from FuboTV’s sports coverage to Acorn TV’s streaming of British, Irish, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealander shows take up the little space that is left. The question remains: Is Dropout.tv worth adding another subscription-based service?
In the words of CollegeHumor president of original content, Sam Reich, “It’s like Netflix, but worse… and cheaper.” The shows on Dropout.tv are unlikely to ever have mainstream appeal, but it is very clear that it supports the creative impulses of the CollegeHumor team. Unlike with its Youtube channel, where skits tend to be formulaic office bits, the business has heavily invested in Dropout.tv, providing its creatives with detailed and expensive sets and locations… and the service is cheap. For people who love CollegeHumor, particularly early 2010s CollegeHumor, Dropout.tv is a nostalgic gem, a full archive of the channel’s content and unfiltered new material from the channel’s creators. For all of that, it's worth the $5.99 per month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor,
Last week, The Crimson published two op-eds denouncing Sex Week as “repulsive” and “backward,” arguing that “true sex” is procreative, monogamous, and love-centered. We, the interns at the Harvard College Office of BGLTQ Student Life and peers in Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, believe every healthy and consensual sexual preference and practice is valid, and we criticize the shaming of sex that falls into this category. The homophobia and transphobia in these regressive views pose an existential threat to our community by dehumanizing us and endorsing violent policy.
Defining “true sex” as procreative suggests that sex must produce a child to be loving, implying that most sex between queer and trans individuals is loveless. Queer people love each other, too. Our sex is no less meaningful than that of cisgender and heterosexual couples.
Moreover, the procreative definition of “true sex” doesn’t apply to all cisgender and heterosexual couples, such as infertile couples or couples using birth control. Shaming anyone for healthy, consensual sex is dehumanizing for folks with widely-varying identities.
The characterization of “true sex” as monogamous ignores the trust and communication central to polyamory. Polyamorous people can be in any number of consensually non-monogamous relationships in many forms, including romantic, sexual, or otherwise intimate. Polyamory isn’t about sex; it’s a relationship model that prioritizes honesty and communication.
Finally, these articles wrongly conflate romantic and sexual attraction. Sex and romance are not the same. You can have sex without love; you can also have love without sex. Sex means different things to different people, and shaming anyone for engaging in or refraining from sex is cruel.
The BGLTQ-exclusive nature of these definitions erase queer sexuality and existence. The Anscombe Society, whose co-presidents are responsible for one of the op-eds, has ties to Focus on the Family, an organization that has advocated for conversion therapy — a debunked practice that threatens the safety of queer individuals. The belief that queer sex is illegitimate and “grotesque,” as these articles state, has violent consequences.
If Sex Week were as offensive as these authors believe, the solution for them is simple: Don’t attend. Sex Week is invaluable to queer people and anyone whose relationship to sex doesn’t fit into traditionalist views. Humans have been having sex for 300,000 years. Why not talk about it?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This month, Massachusetts voters reaffirmed that it is against the law to treat people unfairly, and unequally, because of their gender in places like restaurants, retail shops, hospitals, subways, libraries and parks. Yet, despite this outcome, members of the transgender and gender non-binary community remain in a position that many of them have known their entire lives, one of having to defend their most fundamental rights and civil liberties. This is a community that remains under threat, and we write to reaffirm University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s Oct. 30 position that Harvard remains committed to its policy of inclusion and non-discrimination, and that will not change.
On Oct. 21, news outlets reported that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was considering a narrowing of the current federal use of the term “sex” as either male or female, determined at birth, a change that could restrict the rights and protections currently available to those who identify as transgender and gender non-binary. It remains unclear if or when HHS may issue a change to current federal policy. However, one thing is certain: The existence of transgender and gender non-binary people is not hypothetical or abstract, nor should it be up for debate. Members of this community, at Harvard and beyond, have a right to live without fear, to be visible, and to thrive.
To this end, our non-discrimination policy includes protections on the basis of sex and gender identity, and we affirm and celebrate the diversity of gender identities and expressions represented in our community. Moreover, the University’s current Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy, first adopted in 2014, has consistently gone beyond federal Title IX guidelines. Broadly, we pledge to uphold the principles of inclusivity championed by Harvard’s Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, and its missive to “fully embrace individuals from varied backgrounds, cultures, races, identities, life experiences, perspectives, beliefs, and values.”
For those at Harvard who are feeling fearful, or called to act, or both, we want you to know there are resources here. Join Harvard’s Trans Task Force or one of the University’s other BGLTQ-related student organizations to spend time in community with others; we encourage you to reference this comprehensive list, published by the Title IX Office in partnership with the College Office of BGLTQ Student Life. Other local organizations which support the transgender and gender non-binary community include the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, the Transgender Law Center, and the Transgender Health Program at Fenway Health.
As members of the Harvard University community, we have a unique opportunity to expand our impact. We hail from cities and towns all over the world, from disparate walks of life, and we come with unique needs and desires. But we know, and continue to learn every day, that our diversity is our strength. We must continue to embrace that, and each other, alongside our commitment to our values of inclusion and belonging.
Nicole M. Merhill is Harvard’s Title IX Officer. Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 is a graduate of Harvard Divinity School and Director of BGLTQ Student Life for Harvard College.

On Nov. 13, University President Lawrence S. Bacow sent an email to the Harvard community with updates on the April 13 physical altercation and arrest of a black College student by Cambridge police that later sparked allegations of police brutality. In response to the “profoundly disturbing” events, former University President Drew G. Faust created a review committee to assess the details of the incident and offer recommendations for Harvard to improve. Exactly seven months after the incident, the committee finalized their report and released it to the public.
We applaud the University for this report. Although we are disheartened by how long it took to produce the report — and respond to the fraught worries of the community in the weeks immediately following the incident — the review is thorough and diligently researched. It addresses almost all the concerns raised contemporaneously in April. It is also reflective of the conversations had with many graduate and undergraduate student groups, representatives from Harvard University Health Services, Harvard University Police Department, the Offices of Alcohol and Other Drugs Services, Black Students Organizing for Change, and other administrative officials.
Many of the recommendations speak to the need for accurate and clear communication of the roles that HUHS and HUPD play in the Harvard community. We agree that there is an urgent need for clarification of jurisdictions and services provided, particularly as they relate to HUPD. Students should be informed and should have clear expectations of what HUPD can offer.
After conversations with students surrounding the need for mental health services that currently do not exist, the report recommended that HUHS and HUPD increase cultural and racial competency trainings. We support the institutionalization of these trainings within all University mental health services as well as for House and Yard staff. The College’s method for reporting racial bias was also praised; it should be a model for all other schools in the University and its process should be made accessible to their student bodies as well.
On the other hand, we are concerned that so much of Bacow’s communication focuses on changes to Yardfest. In his email, Bacow expressed his concerns about how the high number of intoxicated students led to HUPD being stretched thin. While it is alarming that the number of calls for service during Yardfest was nearly nearly six times the previous year’s, concerns about student intoxication miss the mark. Simply moving Yardfest to Sunday and tightening the event boundaries would not address the problems with HUHS and HUPD staffing during Yardfest.
The report mentions other concrete solutions that are more relevant to the core problem. For example, it details solutions such as adopting an Emergency Operations Center event management approach and examining the ratio of officers to attendees at large events. We believe the College should be focusing to a greater extent on these. Considering that Yardfest has been an annual event since 2006, it is alarming that HUHS and HUPD were not staffed adequately during the most recent Yardfest. While student intoxication is indeed a serious issue, Harvard should reevaluate the staffing of officers and medical personnel to ensure prompt responses to emergencies.
Harvard has thoroughly analyzed the incident and identified concrete strategies to reinforce safety measures in future events. We hope that the College would continue its efforts to implement the suggested solutions, especially in further clarifying HUPD’s role on campus and improve staffing during Yardfest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early October, I accidentally turned my Social Studies thesis seminar into a personal therapy session. As the seminar leader reviewed the best-thesis-practices we had read about that week — start writing as soon as possible, write every day, build time for writing into your schedule — a strong sense of dread came over me: I did not want to write a thesis about my topic (modernism in mid-century American city planning).
In what might be called a controlled panic, I told my classmates about this dread, and the sense that I had squandered my summer and my academic opportunities at Harvard and any shot at an academic career. My classmates gave me the obvious advice: Change topics. But it was already October. I had spent much of the summer and the semester to date reading about New York’s highways. The thesis prospectus was due the following week. What would I even write about?
Luckily, that week, I discovered “Hamming questions.” Richard Hamming, a mathematician who wrote and spoke frequently about what made researchers productive, would ask his colleagues: What are the most important problems in your field? They would respond. And then, the dagger: Why aren’t you working on them?
Hamming reported that “the average scientist … spends almost all his time working on problems which they believe will not be important.” I applied this to my own studies and realized I did not really believe that my research question, insofar as it existed, would yield an important result. So I decided to ask myself the Hamming questions with modifications. Social Studies is just about the broadest “field” there is, and I was on a deadline. So I asked: What is the most important problem I currently have the background to work on?
The next week, I turned in a prospectus. (My new topic: The ethics of immigration policy, specifically focusing on the possibility of backlash. If it sounds interesting, listen to the episode of Vox’s “The Weeds” podcast titled “With Borders Wide Open,” which covers a lot of that ground.)
One reason Hamming questions strike me as so powerful is their deceptive obviousness. Why would anyone work on problems they don’t think are the most important they could be working on? However did I wind up reading about modern architecture instead of political philosophy? I think the answer for me and for many Harvard students is path-dependency. At Harvard, we’re presented with nearly infinite options with how to spend our time, both here and in the next seven-odd decades of our lives, and when sheer circumstance highlights one option as a path of lesser resistance, we often glide right along.
Hamming questions provide the advantage of a different heuristic, an alternative to the status quo bias wherein we only quit things if they become actively unpleasant. The consequence is that the academic, extracurricular, social, or professional opportunities that appear at critical moments can wind up shaping huge portions of our lives, without us really intending it.
For example: I joined The Crimson’s Arts Board because I arrived late to the open house my freshman fall. Only Arts and News still had representatives staffing their tables. Arts’s first meeting was earlier in the week, and I attended it and enjoyed it. Before I knew it, I had been an editor for two years, giving this organization hundreds of hours of time and focus. I often enjoyed it. But I’m not convinced it was the best use of all that time, and I’m horrified at how little attention I paid to that question. In conversations with friends, they’ve expressed similar doubts and dissatisfaction with their extracurricular choices. Maybe it’s not healthy or productive to constantly question your commitments, but we get eight semesters at Harvard, each with their own beginnings and endings — eight opportunities to actively choose to spend your time doing something important, or at least truly enjoyable or meaningful.
But extracurricular choices do not hold the highest stakes, and path-dependency is not the only source of problems. No doubt, some Harvard students choose their concentrations after asking themselves Hamming-esque questions. But our usual reason for choosing a concentration, other than financial gain — a reason so widely accepted that it seems crazy to challenge it — is that we find the subject interesting; we liked the classes we’ve already taken in it. Don’t get me wrong, this is an important factor: Hamming found that researchers who were emotionally involved in their subject were more productive within their field.
But as the only factor in choosing a concentration, it’s solipsistic. Surely, given the immense luck involved in accessing Harvard’s resources, we have some obligations to the rest of the world that our knowledge production help improve lives, even in the very long run. Actions have opportunity costs. Choosing to study, say, ancient history, a topic I personally find very interesting, would have meant foregoing research on immigration ethics, which in turn meant foregoing research on global health or climate change or other areas of immense humanitarian importance.
Even if you, like me, are long past the concentration-declaring stage of life, the Hamming questions can still clarify. Applied Rationality groups have transformed the Hamming questions for non-academics, instead asking: What is the biggest bottleneck in your productivity, or in your personal life? If you were looking back at yourself ten years from now, what is the obvious thing you should be doing but aren’t? Ultimately, the Hamming questions can do more than re-orient research. They invite reflection, a chance to zoom out. I wish I’d found them earlier in my time in the mind-bogglingly possibility-rich setting of Harvard College. But to paraphrase a (supposedly Chinese) proverb, the second-best time to ask Hamming questions is now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Community organizers from the Boston area and across the United States convened this weekend for a two-day conference on “Race, Racism and Mental Health” hosted by the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at the Harvard Law School.
The conference comprised a series of panel discussions that touched on the intersection of race and mental illness in modern America. The audience included local high school and college students, Cambridge residents, and Boston-area medical professionals.
In a conversation held early Friday afternoon, three Bostonian social workers convened to discuss their personal experiences with structural racism they say led to mental illness. The trio also offered advice for the next generation.
Abrigal S. Forrester, a panelist and the director of community action at the Madison Park Development Corporation, urged black Americans to improve their own neighborhoods to show solidarity in the face of overwhelming structural racism.
“My experience everyday is the urgency of now," Forrester said. "That young man who’s carrying a gun in Roxbury or Dorchester, who feels like he’s worth nothing… What I can say to him is, ‘Baby boy, the gig can stop. You don’t have to keep hurting yourself. We love you.’”
He also spoke about the link between institutional racism and disproportionate diagnoses of mental illnesses among people of color.
“There’s work that we have to do in recognizing our own internal oppression and systems that we are a part of that continue to repeat the process of compounding trauma for people who have challenges in our society," Forrester said.
Panelists later devoted 40 minutes to answering questions posed by attendees.
Panelist Phillipe Copeland, professor at the Boston University School of Social Work, suggested that victims of racism should identify their oppressor and avoid blaming themselves — and that, ultimately, these individuals should work to reach "peace and reconciliation."
“Black people are not just feeling bad. Things are being done to us that would make any human being feel bad," he said. "And so the people who are doing that need to stop. If part of the battle is not being named and doesn’t want to be peaceful, there is not reconciliation.”
Nyamuon Nguany Machar, the third panelist and the leader of "Youth Move Maine," rounded out the discussion. Attendees included members of Arlington High School’s Black Student Union.
“It was very eye-opening, very eye-opening. I love all the new data and statistics I’ve been exposed to," Arlington High junior and attendee David L. Lopes said. "I knew a lot of that stuff but not all of it. I thought I was woke, in parentheses, but now I’m even more awake.”
The students said they especially admired the panelists’ use of data. Arlington student Jordan S. Saintil said that she hope to update Black Student Union projects by “showcasing that data.”
Saintil said that integrating data into BSU presentations will help Arlington students “understand and see what we’re going through daily.”
"I’m definitely gonna be snagging some of those useful techniques," Lopes said.

Two Harvard seniors — Brittany N. Ellis '19 and Jin K. Park '18-'19 — have won the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship and will continue their studies at the University of Oxford next year, the American secretary of the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday.
Park is the first beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to become a Rhodes scholar in United States history. This year marked Park’s second time applying for the Rhodes — and the first year that DACA recipients were eligible for the scholarship.
DACA is an Obama-era initiative that allows undocumented youth to legally live and work in the U.S. President Donald Trump sought to repeal the program in Sept. 2017, but his work to end DACA met with significant legal challenges. The phase-out is currently on hold pending action in court.
Park's Rhodes aspirations helped shape the Rhodes Trust's decision to open the scholarship to DACA recipients.
Last year, Park was ineligible to apply for the Rhodes under the scholarship guidelines then in place. He went for it anyway. Operating with support from Harvard's Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, Park underwent the rigorous application process in the hopes that undocumented students might eventually be considered for the honor.
Though he was not selected last year, Park's application caused the Rhodes Trust to rethink their criteria for DACA recipients, according to URAF Director Gregory A. Llacer.
“It basically was this kind of watershed moment, that [Park’s] application and his fortitude opened up,” Llacer said. “So it’s really gratifying to see him be successful.”
Park said in an interview that his undocumented status has formed his academic interests and career aspirations. A concentrator in Molecular and Cellular Biology with plans to go to medical school, Park said he wants to use his medical training to improve health-related policy for immigrants.
“Growing up as an undocumented person in New York City, I had a lot of formative experiences that have taught me that it’s important for me to use my talents and my educational training to give back to the undocumented community,” Park said. “And I wanted to do that through the lens of healthcare.”
Park is the founder and co-director of the non-profit organization Higher Dreams, which aims to help undocumented students navigate the college admissions process.
At Oxford, Park said he will pursue Masters degrees in Global Health Science and Epidemiology as well as Migration Studies.
“I proposed the Migration Studies to gain skills that I can use in the field to responsibly record and document the narrative and the lives of undocumented immigrants in New York City,” Park said.
Park and Ellis are among 32 American recipients of the 2019 Rhodes Scholarship, which pays for several years of postgraduate study at Oxford. Over 350 Harvard students have been selected as Rhodes Scholars since the program’s establishment in 1902, meaning the College has graduated more Rhodes scholars than has any other university.
This year's group of winners boasts the greatest number of women — 21 — ever elected to an American Rhodes class. Nearly half of the class are immigrants or first-generation college students.
Rhodes hopefuls must seek endorsements from their college or university; this year, more than 2,500 sought endorsement and 880 were ultimately endorsed by 281 unique institutions.
Ellis — a Crimson news executive — said she has been thinking about the Rhodes since she was 10 years old. She said she has always been “interested in learning for as long as possible.”
“[The Rhodes scholarship] seemed like the pinnacle of research and scholarship and I knew from a young age that I loved school, that that's what I wanted to do with my life,” Ellis said.
Ellis’s interest in the Rhodes matches her passion for museums. She said she has been “enraptured” with them since she was 12 or 13 years old.
“I think that they are the best institutions to bring people together to learn about contemporary and past societies,” Ellis said.
An Anthropology concentrator, Ellis said she hopes to pursue a Masters in Visual, Material, and Museum Anthropology at Oxford. Ultimately, Ellis hopes to practice “cultural research” and help institutions like museums and universities “tell the stories of cultural objects.”
She noted that both museums and universities are associated with “colonial and imperial pasts,” but said she hopes to change that culture by designing exhibits that reflect both scientific and community interests. Her dream job is to work at the British Museum.
“I'm really committed to making sure that those institutions and projects going forward are as inclusive, accessible, and mutually beneficial as they can be,” Ellis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is renovating its Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute in an effort to drive increased engagement with the library's extensive collection of documents vital to the history of women in America.
The project involves exterior and interior renovations, including building an enlarged exhibit space and a “technology-enhanced” seminar room. Schlesinger closed for construction in November 2018 and will remain closed until September 2019. The renovation is fully funded by the Radcliffe Institute, which is paying for the construction with donations and its own reserve funding.
Project manager Kate N. Loosian said the renovation will restore the library’s exterior, improve its maintenance system, and make its collections more accessible to researchers and the public.
“The interior renovations piece came out of a larger planning discussion that crossed many departments of the Institute in terms of improving public access, whether to events or to the collections,” she said.
Once open, the new seminar room will allow students to digitize paper materials using overhead cameras and will allow them to project images from their laptops onto screens arrayed around the walls, according to Loosian.
Manager of Special Projects and Digital Services at Schlesinger Amanda E. Strauss said she looks forward to the educational opportunities the seminar room will foster.
“I’m very excited for the fact that the research librarians in particular are going to get to work with small groups of students to do some in depth examination of materials,” she said.
Strauss noted that it is the library’s priority to offer innovative ways for researchers to engage with the collection.
“If everything is lying dormant in the vaults, it’s not really doing much good,” she said. “So we’re looking for all different kinds of ways all the time for scholars of all levels to really do actual work in our collections and make new scholarship and make new projects.”
Executive Director of Schlesinger Library and Librarian of the Radcliffe Institute Marilyn Dunn agreed.
“People have the sense of libraries as perhaps a little passive, but really libraries are constantly evolving, finding new uses of technology, developing new teaching skills," Dunn said. “A library never sits still."
The library's inaugural exhibit post-renovation will open in fall 2019. It will feature materials from the papers of American political activist Angela Davis. That same season, Radcliffe will host a conference on race, gender, and incarceration.
Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Tomiko Brown-Nagin said she is particularly excited about the gallery space.
“I think it will allow us to attract a broader audience to Radcliffe and the Schlesinger, and that’s in keeping with my vision of making sure we are connected to the community,” she said.
Though the library is currently closed, researchers can access the collection via a temporary reading room in Fay House on Garden Street. Researchers must make appointments to visit.
Katherine L. Turk, a Radcliffe fellow who is researching documents in Schlesinger’s collection, said the temporary setup has not had a deleterious effect on her research.
“We’re a little bit cozier than we used to be, but that’s not so bad,” she said. “People should not be deterred from using the wonderful resources there because of this construction. It’s just an incredible place, especially if you’re interested in women and gender, it’s sort of like Mecca for many of us."

As California faces the deadliest wildfires the state has ever seen, the Harvard admissions office announced Wednesday it will offer extensions on application deadlines for high schoolers, teachers, and counselors affected by the disasters.
“The Harvard community is deeply saddened to witness the devastation caused by the wildfires throughout California,” the office’s statement reads.
The College is offering affected students extensions beyond the Jan. 1 regular decision application deadline. Teachers and counselors may also request extensions on the set deadline for submitting transcripts, letters of recommendation, and other supporting documents.
The 2018 wildfire season in California is unprecedented in the size and scope of its devastation. Several fires — which ignited earlier in November near Los Angeles and the Sierra Nevada foothills — have burned around 400 square miles of land and killed at least 79 people, while over 1,000 people are still missing. The largest of these wildfires, known as the Camp Fire, decimated the entire town of Paradise, Calif. and become the deadliest fire in recent history.
The fires have destroyed tens of thousands of homes and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents. Amid the destruction and disruption, those who work in college admissions at Harvard and elsewhere say many students in California will likely need more time to complete their applications.
The National Association for College Admission Counseling wrote in an online statement that it recommends colleges adopt “flexibility and accommodations” for high school seniors affected by the wildfires.
“It would be wonderful if all campuses — both public and private — let students and counselors in the impacted communities know that their institutions will work with them as they deal with recovering from these natural disasters in the midst of the stressful college application process,” Marc McGee, the president of the Western branch of the Association for College Admission Counseling, wrote in an email to members.
Harvard's move to extend the deadline is not without precedent. The College has previously offered special accommodations to students whose hometowns were hit by natural disasters.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said last fall that standardized test cancellations and administrative delays seen by affected schools can have “a major effect” on students’ application progress. Some may be more inclined to to consider colleges closer to home in light of the crisis, he said.
“We want to be fair to these students and give them the most complete hearing we can give them,” Fitzsimmons said in a Sept. 2017 interview soon after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey.
The University of California system is also offering affected students an extension on application deadlines. Upon request, UC hopefuls will be granted a 15-day delay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is converting the fourth floor of Lamont Library into a new space for creative writing. The floor is currently closed for renovation and is on track to reopen by the start of the spring 2019 term.
Construction kicked off Sept. 17, 2018 and is expected to conclude on Jan. 31, 2019.
“The project is on schedule and should be available for use in the spring term,” Michael N. Lichten, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences associate dean for physical resources and planning, wrote in an emailed statement. “The fourth floor of Lamont will be used for the English Creative Writing activity.”
Lamont already boastsseveral classrooms, media labs, reading rooms, and a cafe. The library, which is open 24 hours on most weeknights during the term, is often packed with undergraduates studying late into the night.
Some students who regularly study in Lamont said they were unaware of how the new space will be used.
“I am quite excited to see what the reveal of this enigma is, as we don’t quite know what is going on on the fourth floor,” Abigail Y. Pan ’22 said.
Lamont Library posted several notices warning students about possible intermittent construction noise and asking them for their patience and understanding. For some, it hasn't been an issue. David A. Paffenholz ’22 said he has never once felt bothered by the noise.
“I only go there at night, so I wouldn’t be able to tell the daytime construction,” he said.
Pan agreed.
“I have never heard actual construction noises,” she said.
Lichten noted that his office is coordinating with the library management in Lamont to minimize the noise and disruption.
“The project team is working very closely with the Lamont building manager and library administration to ensure that users of the library are not disrupted by the project,” Lichten wrote. “This involves close coordination and scheduling of construction activity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to allocate $15,000 to student programming during Wintersession — the period marking the last 10 days of winter break — at its meeting Sunday.
Until two years ago, the now-defunct Office of Student Life provided the UC with $15,000 to distribute to students who organize Wintersession programs. Last year, the College did not provide money earmarked for this purpose — and multiple UC representatives said the lack of financial assistance from the College left many undergraduates struggling to find adequate funding.
The College increased the UC’s budget by roughly a third this year after raising the student activities fee, an opt-out charge College students pay annually as part of their term bill.
With more money in the bank — and memories of last year’s funding imbroglio — UC representatives said they felt compelled to step up to foot the bill for student-led Wintersession programming this year.
“The current [Dean of Students Office] wants us to look with our own budget to see if we can put together funding for Wintersession activities,” said Finance Committee chair Gevin B. Reynolds ’19.
This year, for the first time, the DSO will review and sign off on Wintersession programs. In the UC legislation’s original form, receiving a stamp of approval from the DSO would automatically make programs eligible for Council funding.
Some representatives, however, sought to gain unilateral control over which programs the UC funds.
Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 proposed an ultimately successful amendment that completely disregards the DSO’s decision about a program.
“If we are the ones that are doing 100 percent of the funding, then we should be the ones that get 100 percent of the say on who is eligible to get funding,” he said. “I think we should say from the get-go that this is our Wintersession funding, so therefore we will give it to the groups that we would like to see get it, per our own policies.”
“That perhaps is me being irritated that the last fund was removed in the first place,” he added.
A spokesperson for the College declined to comment Sunday evening.
Some representatives disagreed with Boucher’s amendment, arguing that working constructively with the DSO would help ensure that all students who need funding can procure it through the UC.
Reynolds said in an interview after the meeting that he hopes the DSO will still publicize available funding from the UC — even given Boucher’s amendment.
“I still will encourage the DSO to encourage all of the people who they recognize to come to us for funding as well, but I think the amendment gives us a little more latitude to not be solely attached to the DSO’s process,” he said.
Some limited benefits from gaining DSO backing remain. Reynolds noted that this official sign-off may give a project “more legitimacy” and the ability to use theHub, a University-run website that helps individual and groups publicize programs.
Sunday’s meeting marked the final one that will be held under the leadership of Boucher and President Catherine L. Zhang ’19. In December, Dean of Students Katherine O’Dair will swear newly elected President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 into their new roles at the helm of the undergraduate student government.

Harvard's commanding 45-27 victory over Yale in the 135th iteration of The Game delighted College students who had witnessed back-to-back losses to Harvard's New Haven rival the past two years — though the game's location at Fenway Park drew mixed responses from undergraduates.
Harvard hosts The Game every other year; when played in Cambridge, the competition typically takes place in Harvard Stadium. This year, though — given the Stadium is under construction — the University chose to move the match to Fenway Park, the storied home of the Boston Red Sox. Park personnel transformed the baseball diamond into a football field ahead of Saturday’s game.
Some freshmen — who have never seen The Game played in the Stadium or in the Yale Bowl — said they liked the nontraditional location.
“I think that it was really cool. Just kind of weird that they put a football stadium inside of a baseball stadium,” Madison L. Fabber ’22 said.
Marwa Albaadani ’22 said she enjoyed the atmosphere at her first Game.
“My favorite part of the event was the turnout since it’s so rare to see all your classmates and teachers in one space at such a wonderful occasion,” she said.
Football team member Will Christiansen ’22 said he was glad the team could contribute to “Fenway history.”
“The Game was a great experience for the team being in such a historic venue and hopefully adding our own contribution to Fenway history,” he said. “This was a huge game and I’m so happy for the seniors and the whole team in general that we got this win. The overall experience was surreal and I’ll never forget it.”
Some students, though, said they would have preferred the usual venue. Noah Singer ’22 said the comparatively long commute to Fenway deterred him from attending The Game.
Singer said he would have been more likely to go had the match taken place on campus.
“It was less convenient. I don’t think that was what made my decision, but I definitely could have seen that if it wasn’t as far away, if there was less travel involved it would have made it easier for me to go,” he said.
Elizabeth A. Kinard ’22 said she chose not to attend The Game for similar reasons.
“It’s just so many people were going at the same time. It’d be hard to get there,” she said.
The College offered free shuttles to and from the stadium starting at 9 a.m. and ending at 6 p.m., though some students said they still opted to pay for transportation to Fenway Park.
The venue switchup did not mark the only change to The Game this year. Administrators also barred tailgates, typically a mainstay of The Game. The Harvard Athletic Ticket Office website states that city regulations prohibit tailgating around Fenway. Earlier this fall, hundreds of students signed a petition calling on the University to allow tailgates in the Athletic Complex.
“It was exciting to have The Game at Fenway, but it wasn’t worth not having the normal tailgates, which most students care much more about than the actual game,” Jake H. Ascher ’19 said.
The University attempted to make up for the loss of the tailgates by providing students with a combined undergraduate tailgate held outside Fenway Park — and by handing out free t-shirts at the event. Harvard also hosted various “student gatherings” on campus.
“As always, our goal is for students, alumni and fans to have a fun and safe experience,” Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an emailed statement at the time students circulated the tailgate petition.
Harvard will not host the Game again until 2020. Lucy M. Jackson ’22 said her first Game was “really incredible” — but, as for 2020, she said she is unsure what to expect.
“It’s going to be a totally different ballpark,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Department of Education released proposed regulations Friday meant to reshape how colleges handle allegations of sexual misconduct — Harvard among them.
The long-anticipated proposal — which was announced alongside a statement by United States Education Secretary Betsy DeVos — provides a new framework for implementing Title IX, an anti-sex discrimination law that guides universities’ approach to handling sexual assault.
The 149-page release — leaked drafts of which have been circulating for months — includes major updates such as a new rule that would allow colleges to decide which standard of evidence to apply in cases of sexual misconduct. Under the new system, schools could use either the “preponderance of the evidence” standard of proof currently in place at Harvard or the more stringent “clear and convincing” standard.
DeVos said in a press release that the new rules will provide the accused due process and ensure Title IX proceedings are “more transparent, consistent, and reliable in their processes and outcomes.” The guidelines are currently open for a 60-day public comment period, after which they will be printed in the Federal Register. Roughly three months after that date, the Department can change federal regulations to make the proposed rules binding.
Such a change would force Harvard to re-evaluate its Title IX policies.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement Friday that Harvard is “reviewing” the draft regulations and that the University’s “top priority” is “ensuring the safety and wellbeing of every member of our community.”
“We have invested significant resources into preventing and responding to disclosures of sexual and gender-based harassment, including sexual assault, and will continue to strengthen these efforts,” Swain wrote.
In a major shift from Obama-era federal guidance, the new rules mandate that schools allow both complainants and respondents in formal investigations to question each other during a live hearing. The guidelines would also forbid conduct that takes place outside the bounds of a school “program or activity” from serving as the basis for a formal complaint. It is unclear whether activity that occurs within the spaces owned by off-campus College social groups could serve as the foundation for a complaint under the proposed rules.
Law School Professor Diane L. Rosenfeld, who teaches a course on Title IX, said the new guidance is “an attempt to make [schools] not responsible for off-campus” sexual assault and harassment.
The Obama-era Department of Education issued its own guidance on Title IX in 2011, releasing a Dear Colleague letter that “strongly discourage[d] schools from allowing the parties personally to question or cross-examine each other” during hearings. The letter argued that this setup “may be traumatic or intimidating, thereby possibly escalating or perpetuating a hostile environment.”
That letter, unlike DeVos’s proposed guidance, did not force schools to adopt its recommendations. Nevertheless, they undergird Harvard’s internal policies, including the current Faculty of Arts and Sciences Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment released in 2016, which governs Title IX proceedings for FAS affiliates. The University updated its policies in 2014.
The rules also suggest shifting away from a “single investigator” model, instead allowing both parties access to all evidence gathered by investigators and requiring investigators to act on the presumption of innocence.
The University Office for Dispute Resolution is tasked with investigating formal Title IX complaints. But as regards College students, the ability to implement ODR’s recommendations and impose disciplinary measures rests with Harvard's Administrative Board.
The new guidelines additionally redefine “sexual harassment” as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity,” based on Supreme Court precedent.
Under the Obama-era policy, “sexual harassment” was defined as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that included “requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”
DeVos rescinded the Dear Colleague letter in Sept. 2017 and allowed schools the opportunity to select their preferred standard of evidence, paving the way for more changes to come.
Law School professor Janet E. Halley said she plans to write a formal comment to the Department advocating for policies similar to the ones currently in place at Harvard Law School, which mandate a different hearing process than the one the government has put forth. She said she thinks the new proposal contains both necessary improvements and “disastrous” flaws.
“A lot of my issues are my concern for the accused, but a lot of my issues are my concern for the complainant,” she said. “There’s good things and bad things for both sides here, so the public furor is pretty idiotic.”
She also criticized the policy’s definition of sexual harassment, arguing that “severe and pervasive” would not encompass a sufficiently wide array of possible behavior. Halley said she would prefer “severe or pervasive.”
Rosenfeld criticized the 60-day notice-and-comment period as “rather short” and noted that the Department released the new guidelines “right before Thanksgiving.”
“That was, I think, a bad faith attempt to do something really drastic while no one was paying attention,” she said. “It’s a 149-page guidance. Sixty days to respond substantively to a really big piece of extremely problematic legislation is a pretty short time.”
While University officials and legal experts review the new federal guidelines, on-campus activists groups have already started gearing up to oppose them.
Campus anti-sexual assault advocacy organization Our Harvard Can Do Better began circulating an open letter to students nationwide opposing DeVos's policies shortly after their release.
The Our Harvard letter charges that, rather than making Title IX “more fair,” the new guidelines “will make it easier for schools to sweep cases of sexual violence under the rug.”
“Existing Title IX processes already provide fair and equal representation to accusers and accused,” the letter reads. “Title IX is designed to provide accommodations to students that the legal system cannot.”
Remedy H. Ryan ’21, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said the organization will participate in the notice-and-comment period and that she hopes other students would as well.
“Anyone can participate in notice-and-comment, so I’d urge all Harvard affiliates to participate in it,” Ryan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since the fall of 2017, Ben Abercrombie has returned to Harvard’s campus.
The defensive back, who suffered a career-ending injury in his first collegiate game, took in the 135th playing of The Game at Fenway Park, traveling with the help of the Harvard Varsity Club according to a post on his CaringBridge page from Nov. 11.
“You know when you’re around certain people it brings good energy and good vibes to the whole surrounding?” said sophomore running back B.J. Watson. “He’s one of those types of guys, so just having him around the locker room and on the field before going out there was a big help.”
Arriving at a practice in the week leading up to the Harvard–Yale game, Abercrombie reconnected with teammates and coaches at his home field, Harvard Stadium.
“Just seeing him again and seeing all the guys react, it was something else,” said sophomore defensive lineman Doug Henze. “A lot of the guys hadn’t seen him since before the Rhode Island game last year.”
On Sept. 16, 2017, Abercrombie traveled to Kingston, R.I., for the team’s season-opening contest against the University of Rhode Island. He was the only freshman to make the travel roster.
In the second quarter, Abercrombie made a hard tackle on Rhode Island’s Marven Beauvais near the Harvard sideline. Abercrombie laid motionless on the field — after a lengthy delay in a near-silent Meade Stadium, the defensive back was ultimately stretchered off the field and transported to Rhode Island Hospital. It was determined that he had fractured vertebrae in his neck, an injury which compressed his spinal cord and paralyzed him below the neck.
After being released from the hospital, Abercrombie continued his recovery and rehabilitation at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta. On Jan. 8, 2018, Abercrombie returned home to Hoover, Ala.
Henze, who also grew up in Hoover, recalls playing youth football with Abercrombie and competing against him on a rival high school team.
“He’s exactly how he’s described,” Henze said. “He’s just a great, down-to-earth guy. He always has your back. He’s really just a guy you want in your corner.”
Currently, Abercrombie breathes with the assistance of a ventilator, though he has been working to wean off the device and breathe on his own. Signals from his brain are too weak to reach the rest of his body and produce unassisted movement, but he is able to perform rehab exercises with assistance.
Teammates and coaches describe Abercrombie as a hard worker who gives 100 percent of his effort to anything he is doing and note that he has maintained that mentality during his rehab process. According to entries on his CaringBridge account, Abercrombie is planning to return to Harvard in the fall of 2019 to resume his education.
“He’s doing what he has to do to walk again,” Henze said. “And the rehab process is painful from what I’ve been told, but he never wavers. He never complains about it. He just puts his head down and says, ‘I’m going to keep doing this. I’m going to walk again.’”

As Thanksgiving approaches, you may begin feeling tempted to list out things that you’re grateful for. Some years, making this list is easy; other times, it’s really hard, which makes you feel pretty awful if you know you’re living an enormously privileged life. Whatever the case is this year, Flyby’s here to get you started on your List of Things You’re Thankful For.
Sleep
Sleeping is one of those rare activities that is both incredibly healthy and incredibly enjoyable. If you slept in today, that’s clearly a luxury to be thankful for. And if you didn’t get the chance to sleep in, you can consider yourself grateful to have found the motivation to get up — and try to get some sleep tomorrow.
Winter
Fans of wintry weather can feel fortunate that a lot of it is coming their way. If you personally could do without the freezing temperatures, you can smile (although perhaps a bit weakly) about how, by tonight, you’ll be one day closer to when it gets warm again.
Christmas Music
Similar concept here — if you love it, enjoy! And if you somehow don’t, the end of Christmas music season is getting closer with every passing minute. We get it, even our ability to listen to Mariah Carey is not endless.
A Break
A large swath of time with no classes is coming soon, which is something everybody should feel thankful for. If, for some reason, you love classes so much you aren’t grateful for break, you can take that negativity somewhere else. You’re probably a positive enough person that you don’t need gratitude help from this list, anyway.
And there you have it, the start of your Thankful List. Flyby sends our best wishes for coming up with the rest of it. Happy start of the holiday season!
