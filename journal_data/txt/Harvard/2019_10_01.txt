On Sept. 10, Caroline Calloway — not previously a household name, but now approaching that benchmark — came into the spotlight after a former best friend published an article in The Cut claiming to be the source of Calloway’s editorial and writing prowess. Everyone promptly weighed in. Some thought the author, Natalie Beach, was merely opportunistic and leveraging Caroline’s hefty following to push herself into the spotlight.
Others felt that Calloway has been begging for attention for ages, and that the piece in The Cut finally gave her the spotlight she so craved. Calloway herself, in an interview with Buzzfeed, makes the case that people consume her content because it is, in fact, art. (I’ll let you be the judge of that.) To paraphrase a question she was asked: Why are we so obsessed with her and the brand of Internet culture predicated on “relatability,” “authenticity,” and oversharing?
Because the rest of us want to be seen. Calloway’s drama — played out over Twitter, think pieces, and interviews — is fodder for our desire to throw our own voices into the void. I’m aware that writing this article plays right into the hands of this trap, because writing something means that the product will be seen by someone, eventually.
Maybe the most telling evidence in favor of this hypothesis is how Calloway’s and Beach’s relationship blew up on the Internet. Plenty of other “newsworthy” stories have done so in the past, but the frenzy, the vitriol, and the hot takes that seemed so sure of their definite, arbitrarily-defined truth seemed to hit a little different this time. Calloway herself thinks the online storm occurred because people love to hate “young white girls with lots of Instagram followers,” but the issue seems bigger than that. The very people who comment and write articles pretend not to care, yet spend a lot of time weighing in.
Let’s face it: We’re addicted to Twitter, Instagram, and Calloway’s random musings while visiting The Harvard Crimson’s own building because we’re desperate to throw our voices out there, to have someone hear us and validate the opinion we have – never mind if it’s incomplete, false, or downright stupid.
Perhaps there’s nothing inherently wrong with this need. We’re social creatures. The Calloway debacle seems to have prompted something visceral in the admiring crowd: She’s a woman who has openly admitted — or, at least, acts as though she has — that she likes attention, she’s figured out a way to get it, and she knows that this method works.
Speech is powerful enough that it sticks around for a while: We know that Julius Caesar did a bunch of things, but what we really remember is “veni, vidi, vici.” We throw ourselves into the comment section of Instagram or tweet into the void because maybe we’ll be the next viral hit. It isn’t bad to want that, yet the speed and strength of the firestorm around Calloway and the piece in The Cut should serve as a reminder that the very words we gratuitously fling out will stay out there, thanks to the permanence of the Internet. There’s a kind of danger of opening one’s mouth before having all the facts, and with influencers like Calloway, truly knowing them all is impossible.
And, of course, despite the naturalness of wanting to be seen, another question floats to the surface: Isn’t there a kind of dignity in abstaining from being seen? In observing, listening, and thinking? Visibility is thrilling, but requires a certain responsibility that many fail to properly understand, let alone bear successfully.
I mean, just look at Beach and Calloway: They are always online. Someone is always watching, scrutinizing. Even if they want to draw the curtains around their privacy, they can’t. By now, the curtains are sheer.

It is easy to put our favorite musicians on a pedestal, especially those as innovative and prolific as Tegan and Sara Quin. Soon after recording their first demo albums in a Calgary, Alberta high school, the twins earned a devout following for their down-to-earth stage presence, ethereal voices, and passionate political activism. Despite their cult status in the indie music scene, Tegan and Sara set out to remind listeners of their humble roots with their latest studio release, aptly titled “Hey, I’m Just Like You.” Comprised of polished reimaginings of demos from the duo’s early days, the album is a jubilant celebration of youthful nonchalance.
Musical content aside, the album’s very structure is a bold creative statement. Artists who reuse older material must prove its contemporary relevance, and critics are quick to label their work as unoriginal or commercialistic. But Tegan and Sara have always taken pride in defying convention, and even the most ardent skeptics are sure to find merit in the result. Most people recall their early teenage years with a blend of embarrassment and confusion. However, Tegan and Sara unabashedly embrace the chaos of adolescence on “Hey, I’m Just Like You.” Each of the album’s 12 songs is a candid, introspective tribute to the excitement, frustration, and formative potential of growing up.
Out of the brooding languor of the album’s opener, “Hold My Breath Until I Die,” emerges its title track, an upbeat, carefree reflection on a drug-fueled night out with friends. The song alternates with jarring contrast between declarations of vulnerability and strength, held together by an undercurrent of softly resonant synth beats and laid-back acoustic guitar. “Sometimes you get tired of pretending like you’re so strong,” begins the second verse, followed immediately by a conflicting statement: “I always feel invincible when you’re around.” Throughout the album, the constantly shifting moods within and across tracks emphasize the instability of teenage emotions.
Tegan and Sara envisioned the music video for the album’s next single, “I’ll Be Back Someday,” as an “ode to anxiety.” The video opens with a shot of the duo in a monochrome blue room, suggesting a sense of melancholy and confinement. A beige landline phone rests on the back wall, interrupting the sea of blue wallpaper. As the video progresses and the background switches from blue to purple to brown, the phone remains the only constant fixture — a fitting role, given its importance in the song’s lyrics. “I wanna call and ask, ‘What's up?’ / Go to dial, but then I stop,” Tegan sings in the first verse, accompanied by electric guitar that intensifies steadily through the pre-chorus. Although the chorus is melodically and lyrically repetitive, especially by its third appearance in the song, the sisters’ precise vocal harmonies and palpable emotion save it from becoming grating.
As the last reverberating guitar chord of “I’ll Be Back Someday” fades into silence, a new kind of instrumentation takes shape: the improvisatory keyboard flourishes that introduce the album’s next track and final promo single, “Don’t Believe the Things They Tell You (They Lie).” The slow, reflective song relies on a subtly syncopated drum beat to maintain its momentum until a defiant electric guitar solo blossoms out of the second chorus. The change in tone is sudden without sounding out of place — further evidence of the band’s gift for transitions between states of mind.
From there, the sisters fill the rest of the album with similarly wistful lyrics and airy, layered vocals. No track is over four minutes long, allowing each one to shine as a brief glimpse into a different aspect of adolescent life. The final track, “All I Have to Give the World is Me,” begins as an admission of insecurity but develops into a powerful affirmation of artistic identity. “All I have to show the world is me, that’s it,” the sisters sing in the chorus. With the freshness and sincerity of “Hey, I’m Just Like You,” they’ve given us more than enough.

Even though it’s been nearly five years since “Hamilton: An American Musical” premiered, the masterpiece that redefined modern musical theater has been a gift that keeps on giving. Various “official” covers, adaptations, and deleted songs from the project came from Hamildrops, a project that released new content each month of 2018, and “The Hamilton Mixtape,” a 2016 mixtape album featuring various artists performing covers and deleted songs from the musical, while unofficial covers by fans and artists alike have allowed the musical’s universe to expand and inspire years after its premiere. Here are the top five “Hamilton” adaptations and deleted songs, just in case you needed your heartstrings pulled or lyrical expectations thoroughly shattered.
5. Bradley Gibson, Isabelle McCalla, and Oyoyo Joi - "Burn" Pronoun Showdown
Feinstein’s/54 Below, a New York cabaret operated by several Broadway producers, hosts a live performance series called Pronoun Showdown, challenging artists to play with the ways a song can transform by flipping its pronouns (ex: Dan DeLuca performing “So Much Better” from “Legally Blonde” from Emmett’s perspective. “The Lion King”’s Bradley Gibson, “Aladdin”’s Isabelle McCalla, and “Memphis”’s Oyoyo Joi took on this challenge by reinterpreting “Burn,” Eliza’s emotional solo ballad, by performing as Hamilton, Eliza, and Angelica respectively. While the original song is a solo that captures one woman’s heartbreak and empowerment, this interpretation twists together the complex emotions of three central characters. Each performer lends incredible vocals that create breathtaking harmonies, and it’s almost shocking that it’s only a cover.
4. “Congratulations”
One of the most celebrated deleted songs from the musical is “Congratulations,” a short piece that features Angelica’s reaction to Alexander’s publicized infidelity to her sister. It’s been covered by Dessa on “The Hamilton Mixtape” and performed live by Renee Elise Goldberry (Angelica in the original Broadway cast of the musical). The song’s punchy, sharp lyrics play on a multitude of the musical’s motifs, providing an angry counter to Eliza’s mournful “Burn.” It’s a brilliant roast over a strong beat, and even as fans debate whether it should’ve been in the actual musical, there are still plenty of ways to experience it now.
3. Immigrants (We Get the Job Done)
Inspired by a line in “Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down),” “Immigrants” by K'naan, Snow tha Product, Riz MC and Residente is featured on “The Hamilton Mixtape.” The song is definitely more grounded in the musical’s rap inspiration than show tunes, and each performer delivers brilliant and scathing lyrics like “sailing on graves” and “we’re America’s ghost writers, the credit’s only borrowed” in their own unique style.
2. Wrote My Way Out
The third song on “The Hamilton Mixtape” by Nas ft. Aloe Blacc, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Dave East demonstrates why Alexander Hamilton’s story can be represented through hip hop, inspired by the musical’s “Hurricane.” “Wrote My Way Out” calls on several different stories of using language and storytelling to overcome disadvantages and become something greater. Even with a transcendent beat and beautiful instrumentation, the lyrics maintain an unrelenting grip on the listener. Look to this song for inspiration the next time you’re stuck facing a blank page.
1. First Burn
In first place is “First Burn,” a Hamildrop of an original draft of “Burn” performed by Ari Afsar, Julia Harriman, Lexi Lawson, Rachelle Ann Go, and Shoba Narayan (who have each portrayed the character of Eliza). While both versions of the song have obvious merits (see: their heavy representation on this brief list), “First Burn” infuses the piece a fresh emotional take, revealing many more layers of betrayal, love, and anger. It doesn’t hurt that there are four times the brilliant vocalists infusing different interpretations of the character into three minutes of pure, angst-ridden melodic gold.

Last week, a bright yellow shipping container set up shop alongside the food trucks of the Science Center Plaza. But instead of holding cargo, the structure served as a miniature performance venue with just enough space for two chairs and an instrument. Inside, solo musicians performed one minute of music for individual listeners as part of the Boston Celebrity Series’ Concert for One project.
Violist and New England Conservatory graduate Rayna Yun Chou conceived the idea of a one-on-one concert to combat the perceived isolation and inaccessibility of classical music. After the project succeeded in Taiwan, she worked with the Boston Celebrity Series to develop Concert for One. During its 10-day run, the public concert series offered free performances to passersby in Boston and Cambridge.
Half an hour after performances began on Friday, Sept. 27, a line had formed outside the makeshift concert hall. In another shipping container, guests could read about Concert for One’s history and deliver their own performances on instruments mounted on the walls, including a guitar and xylophone. Staff members dressed in blue provided colorful markers and encouraged listeners to leave feedback on notecards.
During the afternoon, audience members Iris Y. Cong and Khaleem N. Ali listened to an excerpt from Beethoven’s “Appassionata” sonata, performed by pianist Brianni J. Lee ’20.
Ali, who works in the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct of Harvard College and has studied classical voice, listened to several artists at Concert for One earlier in the week.
“I’m just a huge fan of all kinds of music,” Ali said. “This is my fifth time checking it out. It’s just a minute, and I’ve heard five different instruments.”
Ali also commented on how the performance space fostered a connection between musicians and listeners. “Going into that space — it feels like you’re entering someone’s living room,” he said. “You have this person who is playing just for you. It’s really powerful.”
For Cong, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Physics department, the opportunity to attend a performance was a welcome break from her coursework. “It’s been a stressful week, so I was like, ‘It’s the perfect way to take a break,’” she said.
Lee’s choice of repertoire carried personal significance for both Ali and Cong. “When I was hearing the Beethoven, it makes you think of your associations with it. I remember hearing in a conference about Beethoven’s life and his struggles,” Ali said.
Cong, a classical pianist, noted that artists can develop completely different interpretations of the same piece. “Because I also play piano, I’ve played Beethoven sonatas — not this particular one, but I really enjoy watching other people interpret these sonatas because everyone interprets it in their own way,” she said.
Later that afternoon, lutenist Jonas Kublickas treated listeners to a medley of Renaissance music and improvisation. Born in Lithuania, Kublickas began his musical career as a classical guitarist and studied at Mozarteum University in Salzburg before he discovered the lute at age 19. After completing his undergraduate studies, he moved to the United States and obtained his master’s degree from New England Conservatory in 2016. Kublickas also teaches both privately and for local organizations, including the EKS Music School in Quincy.
“I decided that I wanted to explore the U.S. a little bit, so my teacher invited me to come here to do my master’s at the conservatory. And then when I graduated, I really liked this area, so I just decided to stay,” he said.
A twist of fate brought Kublickas and his lute to the Science Center Plaza on Friday. “It was by accident that I saw the application,” he said. “I was about to board a plane, and I saw this, and I was like, ‘I have to submit.’ But I only had two hours, so I barely filled out the application.”
For one hour, Kublickas performed excerpts by composers John Dowland and Johannes Kapsberger. “It’s just one of the best pieces, personally, that I think Dowland wrote, so I decided it was a great representation of Renaissance lute,” he said of Dowland’s composition, “Flow, my tears.” “I also did some improvisations on Renaissance chord progressions.”
Listeners’ enthusiasm for Kublickas’s music came as a pleasant surprise to him. “I didn’t really know what to expect because today was my first day,” he said. “Mostly non-musicians, which is great. It shows that people are interested. I’m very happy about that. One person said that I made their day. It feels great that you can impact someone’s life — or a day — in 60 seconds.”
Although enthusiastic about Concert for One’s potential, Kublickas expressed concern about classical music’s future. “It is a dying art,” he said. “It’s a big problem. But I don’t really know the cure yet.”
In the meantime, though, Kublickas said he intends to do his part by sharing his music with the world.
“That’s the only way,” he said.

Earlier this month, we finally bid farewell to MoviePass, the film industry’s purest and most innocent sweet summer child. It’s hard to believe it was only last March that I registered for the service, my naïve young heart full of wonder and hope. I ignored the little voice in my head telling me it was impossible, that a company letting me see a movie in theaters every day for just $9.95 per month was never going to last. At the time, it didn’t matter. MoviePass was cool. I was cool.
I carried my personalized red plastic card everywhere I went, signaling membership in what felt like the preeminent modern cinephiles’ club. I watched trailers and read reviews, striving to become a better, more cultured version of myself. Then there was a slight hiccup: After seeing one very obscure film (“Avengers: Infinity War”), I lost my wallet at a Philadelphia steakhouse with my MoviePass card inside.
Obtaining a new card was nothing serious, I was sure. After all, my debit card could do far more damage in the wrong hands, and it had taken just minutes to replace. The MoviePass app housed a customer service chatbot which, strangely, only operated during certain weekday hours. The chatbot eventually directed me to a phone line that placed me on eternal hold. “You guys doing okay over there?” I wanted to ask, but there was no one to answer my call.
Months before the company reported eight-figure annual losses that nearly ruined its investors, I realized something was fundamentally amiss. It was hard to imagine the company making money off of anyone. After all, every MoviePass member I knew was a serious film buff, and every film buff I knew had MoviePass. In the end, I gave up on my lost card and let them keep my money. Clearly, they needed it more than I did.
Do I have regrets? Sure, I wish I’d seen a movie more highbrow than “Avengers: Infinity War." But besides that, no, I do not. MoviePass garnered little sympathy during its painful, well-publicized decline; indeed, many sneered at what seemed like a refusal to die. Its selection dwindled and its subscriber base fled, but the company maintained its quixotic vision until the end.
It just wanted to save the movies. What’s so wrong with that?

“We're gonna strike 'cause our waters are rising. / We're gonna strike 'cause our people are dying. / We're gonna strike for life and everything we love. / We're gonna strike for you. / Will you strike for us?”
-The Peace Poets
As the last note of “Will you strike for us?” fades away, silence eclipses the crowd. For a moment, it’s almost hypnotic. Then, a cheer erupts and a sense of euphoria takes hold. Amidst a diverse and intergenerational crowd of strike participants, few of whom know each other but all of whom share a fierce desire for climate action and justice, the act of raising our voices in song fosters a deep sense of solidarity. Distinct from marching and chanting, song is uniquely transformative. It allows us to transcend a single protest; it contextualizes us as part of a movement.
During the global climate strike on Sept. 20, I sang the strike song twice: first at the Harvard Strike for Divestment and Climate Justice on Harvard’s campus, and later, at the official Boston Climate Strike at Boston City Hall Plaza. Written by the Peace Poets, a NYC-based artists collective, the song foments a sense of interdependence and shared stake among those singing, while also nudging those whose voices have yet to join the chorus. That participants at both strikes performed this song testifies to its resonance and to the greater power of music within social movements. Drawing on a historical legacy of protest and activism, the climate movement is increasingly using song to build community, communicate the climate emergency, and challenge people to raise their voices in a call to action.
Oftentimes, climate music draws people into the movement by breaking down the overwhelming nature of the crisis. These songs put the crisis into simpler language and binary terms to motivate action. Instead of citing statistics to grapple with the reality of rising sea levels and mass displacement, the strike song invokes the palpable feeling that “our waters are rising” and “our people are dying.” The song “Does It Weigh On You?” performed by the Sunrise Movement at the youth organization’s occupation of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office last December works similarly. Its poignant lyrics — ”Storms surge and fires burn but you don’t hear the call / Cause fossil fuels keep paying you, does it weigh on you at all?” — directly target lawmakers with fossil fuel industry ties, creating a sharp moral parallel between them and the public. It challenges lawmakers’ consciences, asking if their complicity in global climate change “weighs on them at all.” The portrayal of inaction as an act of complicity — reflected by the provocative question ”Which side are you on?” — also engages passive listeners, who would much rather see themselves on the side of “our generation” than on the side of bad actor corporations.
“Does It Weigh On You?” is among many climate movement songs that have explicit roots in historical struggles for social justice. This song is based on “Which Side Are You On?” written by activist and poet Florence Reece amidst the 1931 coal miners’ strike in Harlan County, Ky. The song illuminates connections between the climate and labor movements, apparent today in discussions around a just transition to a clean energy economy, which centers fossil fuel workers and marginalized communities in the transition process. Meanwhile, “The People Gonna Rise Like the Water” originates more recently in the Flood Wall Street protest of 2014, which took place only one day after 400,000 people participated in the NYC People’s Climate March. Also aimed at the unsustainable capitalist system, the song's original call for the financial industry to stop contributing to environmental destruction — "I hear the voice of my great-granddaughter / Saying shut down Wall Street now!" — has become a call to do right by future generations and marginalized communities disproportionately impacted by climate change: "I hear the voice of my great-granddaughter / Saying climate justice now!" Like many protest songs, it also represents “people power” as a force that can overcome systemic barriers to change.
Thematically, climate music also bears a strong resemblance to iconic protest songs of the 1960s era civil rights movement like “We Shall Overcome.” This song depicts a future of peaceful coexistence where “we’ll walk hand in hand,” while also stating that “we are not afraid” to fight to realize that vision. The use of a collective “we” to unify singers and listeners persists today. A protest version of Chance the Rapper’s “Blessings” includes the line “They try to stop us, but we keep coming back.” While also reflecting the growing role of pop culture in the climate movement, this song creates an us-versus-them narrative that connects the performers and audience in a shared struggle and encourages resilience.
As the climate movement looks to the past in fighting for a more just and stable future, music provides a fundamentally human call to action. While they can evoke a sense of ecological grief and despair at the gravity of the crisis, climate songs can also create a sense of empowerment and even celebration. Especially among youth-led organizations, climate music represents a form of resistance to structural disempowerment and injustice. Songs defy the system propagating the climate emergency by espousing a shared vision of a more harmonious way of life. This vision is optimistic and thus celebratory. It provides a kind of radical hope for the future—one I felt at the Sept. 20 strikes. That people can sing together and enjoy being with one another, while also recognizing the imminent need for change, is itself transformational.
Ultimately, music like the strike song serves as both an invitation and a challenge. It asks all of us to ask what side of the song we’re on, and whether it’s the right one.
— Contributing writer Ilana Cohen’s '22 column, “Expressions of the Climate Emergency” is a nonfiction column that discusses artistic response and resistance to the climate crisis.

From that undyingly whimsical jingle in “Super Mario Bros.” to the charmingly aggravating “Mii Channel” theme, music from Nintendo’s works have permeated beyond the gaming sphere into popular culture. And for good reason. The Japanese game developer has consistently composed music that not only allows its games to sparkle, but is quite incredible in its own right. Here are its top five amazing soundtracks:
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
“Ocarina of Time”’s soundtrack, written by Nintendo’s flagship composer, Koji Kondo, is not just notable for its timelessly ethereal ballads — think “Kakariko Village” or “Zelda’s Lullaby,” as well as driving tunes like “Hyrule Field” and “Gerudo Valley.” The 1998 video game incorporates music directly into gameplay: By providing musical cues to match environmental changes (an anti-leitmotif of sorts) and requiring players to learn “songs” on an ocarina they acquire, the video game elevates its sonic power to the fore.
Donkey Kong Country
Though developed by Rare, “Donkey Kong Country” features the well-known Mario antagonist in his first role as active protagonist. David Wise’s soundtrack brings a vivid sense of energy and adventure that permeates the game. Drawing from classic Nintendo games, rock, and electronic dance while experimenting with the percussive capabilities of video game audio generators, Wise depicts the diversity of the environments Donkey Kong explores — from the nostalgic “Title Theme,” to the groovy “Island Swing,” to the ethereal “Aquatic Ambience” — with satisfying excitement.
Kirby Super Star
“Kirby Super Star,” released in 1996, presents a fresh take on the familiar tunes and themes that dominate the Kirby series. The happy-go-lucky, slightly frenetic nature of “Green Greens” is transformed into the spiky, stilting “Gourmet Race,” controlled and distilled into the driving “King Dedede’s Theme,” and takes a somber demeanor in “Meta Knight’s Theme.” “Kirby Super Star,” under the pen of Jun Ishikawa, propelled the musical flavor of the franchise to a new echelon.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
“Breath of the Wild,” a fundamentally open-concept video game, brings its organicity and fluidity to all elements of its game design — including its sonic repertoire. As such, the vast world before Link, the protagonist, is dotted with sparse but undeniably expressive phrases that are motivically interlinked with the surroundings (both physical and social) explored. And yet, making use of a pianistically-rooted strength supported by the backing of a full orchestra, “Breath of the Wild” still exemplifies all the intimacy, nuance, and complexity that the Zelda franchise’s music has progressively generated and developed.
Super Mario Galaxy
One of the first Nintendo games to employ a full orchestra, “Super Mario Galaxy”’s soundtrack brought a new dimension to the relation between music and gaming. Indeed, beyond a vast array of pieces spanning from the most triumphant fanfares (such as the ever-famous “Gusty Garden Galaxy” — to the prettiest of textures — as generated through the in-game development of “The Comet Observatory”) Mahito Yokota and Koji Kondo’s score pays meticulous attention to Mario’s interaction with his milieu. Sound effects are individually tuned to suit the background, in a manner that is not too obvious, but nonetheless allows the sound and the game to shimmer.

Over the past couple years, a strange new animal has emerged in the global fashion scene: the hypebeast. Primarily comprised of hip, trend-following Gen Z youth, the hypebeast, according to the third most popular definition on Urban Dictionary, is supremely concerned with the procurement of wardrobe items from brands with “hype.”
The relative “hype” of a brand centers largely around the artificial scarcity of released items, which are often limited edition or released in limited quantities on set “drop” dates, and are often collaborations with well-known artists and celebrities. This elusive quality of “hype” seems to be of the same character as Kim Kardashian’s fame: Famous for no good reason, besides being famous. Hypebeast brands, too, are hype for no good reason, besides being hyped.
This almost unwavering brand loyalty to canonical hype brands (e.g. A Bathing Ape, Supreme, Yeezy, Off-White) has brought hypebeasts a good deal of criticism — hypebeasts are frequently criticized for buying poorly-designed items from hyped brands, simply because of the hegemonic influence of the brand itself.
But even hypebeasts have a limit to what they’ll wear. Kanye’s new Yeezy foam runners, which he recently announced, are an objective atrocity. Twitter users have called them “crocs that went to private school” and “shit trash.” Google “Yeezy Foam Runner” and you will instantly see hundreds of articles flaming these glorified crocs — and for good reason. Kanye has committed an inexcusable offense. No reasonable person would be able to deny that these shoes, are, in fact, “shit trash.”
There is something particularly and inexplicably disgusting about the combination of a Yeezy sneaker silhouette with perforated white foam. Designers tried — and failed — to make the shoe sleeker with smoother, long-running gaps in the foam rather than round holes, as are typical of crocs. The effect, instead, is just a slightly speedier-looking croc.
But will hypebeasts still hop on this (aggressively repulsive) drop? Many of the purportedly ugliest designs from hype brands receive criticism upon reveal but wind up still selling out within seconds of the drop, destined to be resold at an exponentially higher price. If history is any indication, the hypebeasts will persist.

Once seen as a rising star of down-to-earth, do-it-yourself indie rock, Sophie Allison — the artist behind Soccer Mommy — asserts in her new single “lucy” that people aren’t always what they seem.
“lucy,” Allison’s first new work since her debut studio album “Clean,” still pays homage to her history working on a Tascam digital recorder by drawing the listener’s ears away from melody and towards production quality. The reverb on the track’s opening measures is so high that each note begins to ring dissonant against itself, her voice reminiscent of an echo off the studio walls. A caricature of the Nashville singer’s hometown charm makes a cameo in the chorus, where she drops a “g” to say, “Oh, Lucy, please, quit tauntin’ me,” perhaps with an imagined twang.
But Allison is no longer the congenial best friend you can carry around in your AirPods, even if “lucy” is ultimately a higher brow take on the ever-relatable ode to the bad boy. The psychedelic rock-infused track is overwhelming and slightly sinister, the way an arcade might read in a horror movie: full of many simple, aggressively major-key soundbites which don’t fit neatly together. Running through this potentially oppressive soundscape is the repeated motif of the number three. Lyrics are broken up into trisyllabic pieces; three major melodic segments (two of three notes each) make up the song’s vocal palette; the track even opens with an arpeggiated triad. In the context of “lucy”’s threatening atmosphere, which makes use of hellish imagery like “brimstone and fire,” the recurrence of the trinity is disquieting. More overarchingly, then, Allison’s goal with this single is to make you uncomfortable (and maybe a little turned on).
The eerie, even menacing discord between these ostensibly warm fragments parallels the contradictions inherent to the person “lucy” describes as “the root of all evil...with shiny eyes.” Though the chorus’s repeated plea for relief from this irresistible central figure addresses the title “lucy,” Allison’s verses refer to him with he-series pronouns. Perhaps the song’s “lucy” simply defies the expectations of its traditionally female name, but perhaps Allison assumes her bad boy’s voice in the choruses, telling herself to “stop taunting” in her heavily conflicted verses about him. And if that’s so, in those choruses, the listener steps into her shoes and bears the brunt of the command. If critics once tied much of Allison’s appeal to how close she can get to her listeners, “lucy” brings them too close for comfort.
That Allison would use “lucy” to stake a new claim for her musical persona is not altogether unsurprising. This single marks her switch from Fat Possum Records (see their cringe-worthy motto: “We’re trying our best”) to Loma Vista Recordings, the label of Iggy Pop and Common. Despite her success, the NYU dropout in her early twenties is much more aptly described as an artist to watch than a household name. If she expects Loma Vista to serve as her springboard to stardom, “lucy” was indeed her chance not to craft an entirely new image, but to prevent her permanent image from becoming cemented as yet another girl-next-door indie artist. Allison demonstrates here that, much like the figure at the heart of the single, Soccer Mommy’s got a dark side.
But when you Google “Soccer Mommy,” the first hit is still Allison’s Bandcamp page. At least for now, she’s a bedroom singer-songwriter with an ear for production and a single dipping her toe into a more edited sound. If her next album follows in “lucy”’s footsteps, she’ll be up to her waist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One word alone can describe Mac DeMarco’s concert at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston on Sept. 22: eccentric. Just months after the release of his album, “Here Comes the Cowboy,” DeMarco and his band performed a handful of new songs along with hits, fan favorites, deep-cuts, and unexpected covers from Metallica to The Misfits. Mac DeMarco and his goofy ensemble blended humor, charisma, and musical talent to an endlessly entertaining effect.
Around 9 p.m., DeMarco and his four-piece band walked onto a stage bathed in thick blue light, welcomed by thunderous applause. Mac DeMarco walked out in a t-shirt, a baseball cap, and his own merch — Mac DeMarco-brand drawstring shorts — proceeding to introduce the band before their monstrous 24-song set.
DeMarco accompanied their first song, the woozy “On the Level,” by prancing around stage, swinging his mic in time with the keyboard’s melody. His charisma permeated every aspect of the performance. When the band broke out into their hit, “Salad Days,” from DeMarco’s 2014 album of the same name, the crowd exploded. He whipped out an electric guitar, crooning the song’s infinitely catchy melody. For the rest of the show, he alternated between this 1970s Fender Stratocaster and an acoustic guitar, both worn high on his chest.
DeMarco’s energy was nothing short of infectious. He and his band are the kind of group that everybody wants to be in: fun, endlessly talented, and perfectly at ease on stage. They talked amongst themselves as though no one was there, yet still delivered jokes to the crowd like a comedic quintet set on desecrating Boston accents and Plymouth Rock. At times, the band would take the spotlight from DeMarco, exchanging one liners about lobster rolls — “the most ancient of all fish” — and ex-members of the band. At others, DeMarco went off on entertaining tangents.
In the first of many such nonsensical soliloquies, Mac indulged the audience with a memorable take on rings: “I’ll tell you the truth about me and rings. There’s something wrong. You know the sexy people, sexy men that wear rings like Johnny Depp or some shit,” he said. “Damn, he looks like a pirate, it’s crazy. I put one on and there’s something wrong with the room immediately.”
At 10:30 p.m., lead guitarist Andy White remarked that it was past their bedtimes, but their energy seemed endless and the quality of their performance never wavered. DeMarco refused to stay in one place. Instead, he opted for Gollum-like stomping, handstands, and strange noises, to which the crowd would respond with louder cheering. At one point, he partook in a solid minute of back and forth growling with the audience. Every song sounded like warm honey, breezy and perfect for swaying and holding up a lighter — or, more accurately, an iPhone flashlight.
“Choo Choo” from “Here Comes the Cowboy” was wonderfully funky live. DeMarco was quick to encourage dancing, saying, “If you wanna shake your butt around, go ahead.” He proceeded to do so himself. The band stripped down the song “Still Beating,” rendering it especially heartfelt. During “Another One,” Mac DeMarco asked for the house lights to turn on so he could see the whole crowd. About a third of the way through the song, when the obligatory iPhone flashlights once again lit up, he ordered the stage lights off, leaving the audience totally exposed. It was in many ways an equalizer, a blurring of the lines between performer and audience. In that moment, the concert felt intimate, like being let in on a secret.
The seven-song encore was the height of eccentricity. DeMarco underwent a costume change. After leaving the stage briefly, he reappeared wearing his shirt on his head like a makeshift Pharaonic headdress, crouching behind the amp while his band began to play the solo from Kansas’s “Carry on Wayward Son.” Herman’s Hermits’ “I’m Henry VIII, I Am” was also given the star treatment in a particularly energetic performance. For their renditions of The Misfits’ “Hollywood Babylon,” “Where Eagles Dare,” and “Hybrid Moments,” the whole band switched instruments, with White assuming the role of the quintessential rock n’ roll front man. “We’re gonna start a Misfits cover band on the breaks from this tour,” they announced. White resumed with the sarcasm he had adopted throughout the show:
“I appreciate the applause but I did ask all you guys to be quiet. Please be respectful,” he said. “The way I’m feeling reminds me of when Jesus was on the cross. When he was like, ‘forgive them father they don’t know what they do.’ That’s how I feel right now.”
They closed the mammoth show with Metallica’s “Enter Sandman,” dedicated to their “best friend in Boston, taken a bit too soon…the world’s greatest FBI agent, James ‘Whitey’ Bugler.” It was a perfectly enigmatic ending to the show, complete with a powerful slap-in-the-face delivery from DeMarco. After his whirlwind of a concert, DeMarco left the audience with a deliberately nonchalant message sure to remain in their memories:
“Okay, goodbye.”

Next year, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston is celebrating its 150th birthday — complete with free memberships, new exhibits, and community initiatives that museum representatives say will help the museum move into the 21st century.
According to the press release, the museum’s new initiatives include access to free first-year memberships at MFA Late Nites and community events such as Latinx Heritage Night and Lunar New Year Celebration.
“The MFA’s 150th anniversary is a moment to honor our past and, more critically, anticipate our future,” director Matthew Teitelbaum wrote in a press release.
The press release states that the museum also plans to encourage diversity through current and upcoming exhibits. The Art of the Americas Wing will house the exhibit “Women Take the Floor” throughout 2020, and the MFA will open exhibitions featuring various artists of color over the next two years. “Women Take the Floor,” which opened in September of this year, features around 200 artworks including paintings, sculpture, jewelry, ceramics, furniture, textiles, prints and photographs by over 100 different female artists.
MFA spokesperson Karen Frascona wrote in an email that the museum aims to highlight traditionally unheard voices in its upcoming curatorial decisions.
“Curators wanted to take the opportunity to challenge the male-dominated history of 20th century American art, while acknowledging the Museum’s own role in perpetuating this narrative,” Frascona wrote.
While the MFA is affirming its commitment to diversity to celebrate its birthday, the press release was also announced in the wake of multiple allegations of racial discrimination against the museum. One incident centered around racist language used by museum staff while addressing a student field trip. The other incidents involved racist remarks made by patrons of the museum. Frascona wrote in an email that due to the ongoing nature of the investigation, she could not comment on the incidents. The MFA’s website states that the museum revised its staff training and banned the patrons who made racist remarks.
In addition to its community integration initiatives, the MFA will also be launching a discussion group called “Table of Voices,” which gather local stakeholders to “formalize interpretive strategies” for exhibits according to a recent press release. “Table of Voices” will draw on a range of diverse perspectives in order to expand the MFA’s reach.
“The MFA will recruit ‘Table of Voices’ participants with a focus on community members who have experience with or affinity for the subject matter at hand,” Frascona wrote.
The MFA also announced plans to open a new 22,000 square foot Conservation Center in the summer of 2020. The Conservation Center will focus on the care and preservation of the MFA’s collection, as well as encourage visitors to “connect with art and science in new and dynamic ways,” according to a press release.
The open-layout floor plan of the Conservation Center aligns with efforts to increase community involvement and visitor engagement at the museum. Since moving to its current location on Huntington Avenue in 1909, the MFA has held over 500,000 works of art at one time, but is only able to display a small number of pieces in the galleries. According to Harvard professor of Organismic and Environmental Biology James Hanken, the Conservation Center will “give public-museum goers some exposure to other activities behind the scenes.”
Hanken — also a curator at the Museum of Comparative Zoology — added the MFA is “responding to the same imperatives that are confronting many museums.”
“They realize that they need to cultivate urban populations that are changing [because] tourist populations are changing, ages, demographics are changing, and museums have to change with the times,” Hanken said.
With over 1.2 million visitors a year, Frascona wrote that the MFA’s new initiatives provide an opportunity for underrepresented artists from around the world to display their work.
“As the MFA approaches its 150th anniversary in 2020, new initiatives are driven by a deepened commitment to inclusion, community and generosity,” Frascona wrote.

An hour before “Digital Anxieties: a Conversation with Bo Burnham and Jonny Sun,” a line had already formed down the hallways of the Compton Laboratories at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On Sept. 27, students from universities in the Boston area gathered to watch comedian and director Bo Burnham and writer and illustrator Jonny Sun discuss mental health in the age of technology.
Burnham and Sun gathered onstage to discuss isolation and community in an over-publicized era, examining how social media can make mental health both better and worse — and how we can all encourage a healthier use of the internet.
“You are not alone in your loneliness,” Sun said.
In 2006, Burnham began uploading videos of himself singing on YouTube that went viral. He has since enjoyed a successful career in stand-up comedy, and has produced the shows “Words, Words, Words,” “what.,” and “Make Happy.” Most recently, he wrote and directed his first feature film, “Eighth Grade,” which received numerous awards.
Sun is the author and illustrator of the book “everyone’s a aliebn when you’re a aliebn too” and the illustrator of the New York Times best-selling “Gmorning, Gnight!” by Lin Manuel Miranda. He is a writer for the sixth season of “BoJack Horseman,” a Ph.D candidate at MIT, and a creative researcher at the Harvard metaLAB, where he studies virtual communities created by social media.
Both Burnham and Sun’s professional backgrounds equipped them to address mental health issues, especially within the context of social media. Both initially found success through online platforms — Burnham through YouTube, Sun largely through Twitter — and both have had to deal with their own struggles in the publicized social media sphere. Sun has struggled with depression, and Burnham often had panic attacks while performing stand-up. Sun currently studies online societies, while Burnham’s “Eighth Grade” addressed coming-of-age in a self-broadcasted era.
“I’ve had probably 20 panic attacks in my life, 19 of which have been onstage,” Burnham said.
Burnham and Sun began the discussion by talking about social media usage in their own daily lives. Burnham argued that many contemporary artists engage their audience too much in their creative process, dispersing fragments of information and asking for continuous feedback.
“You can’t be creative. You’re constantly in a dialogue with your audience,” Burnham said.
Sun also contended that the internet had an element of exhibitionism. “Everyone is performing to each other all the time,” he said. He cited reaction videos and a constant, rapid-fire exchange of ideas, which Burnham named a kind of “cultural cacophony.”
After the initial discussion, Burnham and Sun engaged in a question-and-answer session with the audience. One audience member asked a question about mental illnesses, to which Sun confessed that he created a bot that sent him notifications every hour or so to do something small to improve his mental health. When asked about the validity of virtual friendships, Sun said that connection is connection, “no matter where we find it.”
“[Burnham’s] comedy I think is something that provides a sense of light within darker times,” audience member Dillon Powell said. “When you’re going through a harder time he’s somebody that both relates to you and is still very human.”
Other members of the audience felt similarly. “When they were talking about finding greatness and being great to one specific person as opposed to a whole audience of people, I felt like that really resonated with me,” Nadine A. Jackson ’23 said.
When the discussion came to an end, the stage flooded with students clamoring for selfies, autographs, or a chance for brief conversation. The Internet is, after all, an inescapable phenomenon that resonates with a generation that has never known a world without it.
“I wake up on it, I go to bed with it,” Burnham said.

A few weeks ago, professional sad-girl Lana Del Rey turned her melancholic fury on an unexpected victim — not men, summer, or drug store eyeliner, but the unwitting author of a lukewarm NPR review.
“Here’s a little sidenote on your piece,” Lana tweeted out at her 9.6 million followers, tagging writer Ann Powers directly.
“I don’t even relate to one observation you made about the music. There’s nothing uncooked about me. To write about me is nothing like it is to be with me. Never had a persona. Never needed one. Never will,” Del Rey said. “Don’t call yourself a fan like you did in the article and don’t count your editor one either.”
What earned an ordinary thinkpiece a personal twitter rant? Powers hardly gave Lana’s album “Norman Fucking Rockwell!” a bad review. She started off saying saying the album “cemented Lana’s status as a serious artist,” and that “Del Rey is at her most instantly compelling.” The thing Lana took issue with, seemingly, was the way Powers described Lana and her “persona,” or brand. Powers only once referenced “Del Rey's persona as a bad girl to whom bad things are done.” She did, however, toe the line between describing Lana’s brand as “nostalgic,” “veer[ing] into cliche,” “derivative,” and “uncooked,” and said it redeems itself with her “compulsion to collapse logic” and “violate boundaries musically, through imagery and within her storytelling.”
What Lana seems to be taking issue with, fundamentally, is the right of any critic who doesn’t know what it’s like to “be with” her, or who she really is. She is challenging any definitive critique of her evolution, or what she, as a cultural figure, represents.
It’s certainly true that the alleged “persona” Powers referenced has, at times, seemed to become the only media narrative about Lana, distilling her from a human being to an eyeliner-drenched embodiment of the sad cool-girl. Is this kind of music criticism, then, unwarranted? Do outside voices have the right to try to define, contextualize, or explain who an artist is and what their music is supposed to be about?
That’s the same question Lizzo, self-love guru and “100% that bitch,” posed in a recent tweet also aimed at a critic. “PEOPLE WHO ‘REVIEW’ ALBUMS AND DON’T MAKE MUSIC THEMSELVES SHOULD BE UNEMPLOYED,” she said, in a now-deleted tweet to her 1 million followers. In this case, the Pitchfork review she was responding to was, perhaps, a little more harsh. Though the reviewer, Rawiya Kameir, described Lizzo as having both an “obvious skill and charisma,” she criticized the musician’s new album, “Cuz I Love You,” for having “overwrought production, awkward turns of phrase, and ham-handed rapping.”
In response, Lizzo’s comment cuts deeper than just an attack on whether a music critic has the right to define an artist’s work, or tell readers they have some kind of definitive understanding. Rather, with all the fresh energy that has made her such an irresistible new voice in pop music, Lizzo took aim at music criticism in general.
Music criticism, particularly as a profession, certainly has its flaws. Has the industry been dominated by white men dismissing, patronizing, and sexualizing female musicians? Of course. Has art criticism itself been synonymous with gatekeeping leaving the unconventional, less powerful, and marginalized on the outside? Without question. Lizzo’s logic, then, makes sense for a little while — what right does a stranger have to define her?
But then, what right does an artist have to tell any writer what they can and can’t say? That seems a particularly Trumpian idea. Take a look at something he tweeted just last week at a critic: “Who the hell is Joy-Ann Reid? Never met her, she knows ZERO about me, has NO talent, and truly doesn’t have the ‘it’ factor needed for success in showbiz.”
It still remains that no one — not Donald Trump or Lana Del Rey — is justified in saying that a person doesn’t have a right to their opinion. The bounds of that right may be murky, of course — an artist certainly has the right to dislike a critic’s opinion, and maybe even share that dislike with their friends. But, at the end of the day, they’ve also got to live with it. And that, it seems, is the thing all of them got wrong.
Every person, whether they’re a politician, a writer, or a professional musician, has a way that they want the world to see them. There’s nothing wrong with fighting to be taken seriously, as Lana, Lizzo, and hundreds of other female musicians often have to do. But it is wrong to call out a particular critic you don’t like, pointedly make them a target for the harassment of your millions of fans by tagging them, and tell them they’re “not a fan,” “should be unemployed,” or that they “know ZERO” about you. It may be far too late to go back to the way things were before the Internet, when no critic would get thousands of hate messages (as Powers in particular did) for writing a music review or criticizing the President. But it’s not too late to agree that everyone still gets a voice, and trying to scare, bully, or guilt them into silence is never a good idea.

What if circus was more than just a spectacle? That’s the question that “Passengers,” at the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theater from Sept. 25 to Oct. 13, seeks to answer. Directed by Shana Carrol and sponsored by Arts Emerson, “Passengers” combines modern dance, acrobatics, and aerial dance to weave an abstract masterpiece about the benefits and woes of travel by train.
Despite its lack of linear plot, “Passengers” still weaves a cohesive narrative with its anthology-type storytelling. Every scene is completely different from the last, but it manages to pull off this variety with grace and wonder. Circus shows often fall prey to a childlike need for constant validation, following each stunt with an awkward break for applause; however, “Passengers” manages to imbue acrobatics with maturity and continuity. The show never takes a breath from beginning to end. There are always things to focus on, even during complicated set transitions.
Beyond the heartstopping acrobatics, the staging of the production is phenomenal. The lighting is exceptional; panning the audience with tight, beamed spotlights to simulate a train passing, and using hand-held lamps to direct audience focus and project artists’ shadows. Lighting designer Éric Champoux also makes frequent use of projected sets. Alongside ambient train noise, holographic backdrops create a truly immersive experience. Perhaps most impressive is a video of a telephone projected over a traditional Chinese pole (a rotating, 10-30 foot pole the acrobats climb).
“Passengers” also uses an incredible score to facilitate changes between each scene. Music Director Colin Gagné had a genius use of natural percussive noises in one of their numbers, bringing together ordinary sounds — a sneeze, a yawn, a pen tapping, or a woman saying “excuse me” — to create a “song” that brings the show’s juggling piece to life. The fun jazz music gives context to the Fosse-inspired jazz and hula hoop choreography. The entire show plays into the old American wonder at the railroad; acrobats flipping and rolling across the stage like tumbleweed further heighten into that nostalgia.
The entire production is incredible, but a few performances stand out. Every show should begin and end with a bang, and “Passengers” certainly does. The opening group piece showcases dance, hand-to-hand balancing, and human swings. “Passengers” uses circus art as not just a spectacle, but a tool for immersive storytelling. Of the individual apparatus performances, two pieces were particularly breathtaking. First, the duo trapeze act was astounding. Not only were the acrobats doing expected flips and hand-to-hand work, but the duo also managed to get an audible gasp from the audience when they dropped the female acrobat unexpectedly from the trapeze hovering 10 feet in the air, into the waiting arms of her cast mates. The unexpectedness of these dramatic stunts makes the show truly feel like magic.
A second show-stopping moment is the notoriously difficult Russian Cradle, near the end of “Passengers.” In a Russian Cradle stunt, one acrobat is a base connected to a platform. Meanwhile, the other swings underneath the platform and then launches into the air before being caught again by their partner. It’s an apparatus that takes a tremendous amount of strength, coordination, and experience. The Russian Cradle performance in “Passengers” closed the show — and for good reason. It began with the flyer unexpectedly diving head first off of the platform, only to be caught by his ankles. With trick after trick, the performers showcased an athletic energy and raw fearlessness that was matched only by the intensity of the music behind them.
In “Passengers,” every element of production came together to create a show that, while smaller in scope than Cirque du Soleil, creates wonder of the same magnitude. The beauty and ingenuity of this show make it a must-see for all audiences.

Leigh Bardugo’s latest novel, “Ninth House,” features a cast of ghosts, demons, and haunted houses, but its fantasy world exists neatly within the brick and mortar of New Haven, Conn., and its conflict roots itself far more deeply in reality than it does in the supernatural.
Galaxy “Alex” Stern is a textbook miscreant: a high school dropout, drug dealer and abuser, and now, survivor of a mass homicide. Miraculously, upon waking up in the hospital, Alex receives the opportunity of a lifetime: a full scholarship to attend Yale University. The dean selects Alex for a purpose; she has the unique ability to organically see, communicate, and interact with “Grays,” or ghosts. Bardugo’s Yale is home to a host of secret societies, the alumni of which are now some of the most powerful people in the world, and the members of these societies frequently engage in dangerous rituals to make themselves richer, more famous, and more powerful. Supernatural abilities in her back pocket, Alex is newly christened a member of Lethe House, a covert organization dedicated to regulating the rituals and goings-on of Yale’s elite.
What makes “Ninth House” so compelling — and, at times, painfully self-conscious — is its unnerving plausibility. Yale really does have secret societies, and famous alumni of the Skull and Bones society, which exists both in real life and in the novel, include “former presidents, diplomats, at least one director of the CIA.” In the novel, the rituals include portal magic, hallucinogenic drugs, and prognostications, or divination through human entrails. The subjects of these prognostications are often mental hospital patients, nurses paid off with the assistance of deep pockets, and the cultivators of these magic drugs are “townies” down on their luck. Now, when the exclusivity of Ivy League universities and other elite institutions is the subject of considerable controversy, it is all too fitting that a society primarily composed of the wealthy few risk the lives of the defenseless for their own material gain. The societies have an egregious upper hand; there is nothing, Alex thinks bitterly, “they couldn’t buy their way out of.”
The novel focuses far less on the intricacies of its ghosts and ancient societies than it does on real-world problems. It does so, however, with mixed results: While Bardugo portrays a thought-provoking portrait of the overwhelming power given to the members of the educated elite, she also touches tangentially on sexual abuse and racism without adequately addressing either. Alex comments on the perpetrator of an act of sexual abuse: “[he] was rich and beautiful and beloved, and there was a big difference between things being fair and things being set right.” Though a noble sentiment, the novel would have benefited had its author focused on one of these issues, rather than attempting to discuss all of them. The incidents of sexual abuse and racism are never psychologically resolved or even explored in-depth.
Likewise, Bardugo mentions the destructive power of addiction and its psychological effects, but never fully discusses the transformation that Alex undergoes in becoming clean for the first time in years. She appears once in the hospital, and then, after years of “alcohol, oxy [...] anything that unwound her focus,” shows up at Yale sober, physically if not mentally recovered. The dependence of Darlington, Alex’s mentor, on a powerful supernatural elixir is described as similar to a junkie — “Magic was all he had” — but his storyline on that front is left, at least for now, largely unresolved: His obsession with the occult is more justified than reprimanded.
The problem with “Ninth House” lies furthermore in its fragmented structure and themes. It does not progress chronologically, and while this serves on the one hand to layer the novel, pairing related scenes from different seasons side-by-side and integrating various characters from variegated places and times, it also results in a frenetic, patchy development. While this does mirror, on the one hand, Alex’s transformation and fight to find her own identity in a journey from West to East Coast, druggie to upstanding citizen, it also interrupts at times the brisk pace of the plot.
That being said, the world of “Ninth House” is an intoxicating one, its elegance afforded by its believability. The problems that Bardugo, an alumna of Yale herself, raises with the secret societies and old-boy exclusivity, are valid and deeply important, but they suffer from a lack of refinement.

There is no “typical” Harvard student. There are 6,699 students from around the country and the world, and every single one of us took a different path to get here. Some of us excelled in sports or in the arts, some others through writing or science, but on campus, all of us form part of one Harvard student body — constantly in the process of learning to grow in conversation with itself.
Still, a recent Duke University study confirms two things that many Harvard affiliates likely already know. First, applicants who can be characterized as having legacy, athlete, or donor or faculty family status have a leg up in the admissions process; and that, second, removing athlete and legacy preferences would significantly change the racial make-up of Harvard’s student body, reducing the number of white students.
However, the paper still makes many striking findings: 43 percent of white accepted students between 2009 and 2014 were athletes, legacies, faculty children, donor family members, or, likely in many cases, some combination of them. And, according to the study’s modeling, only about a quarter of those students would have been accepted if they didn’t fit one of those categories. Running the numbers yet further, the study finds that if legacy and athletic preferences respectively were abolished, the number of white students admitted overall would fall by 4 percent and 6 percent in each scenario.
In order to make sure it enrolls a diverse group of students, Harvard should strive for a truly holistic review that does not provide separate admissions pathways for any students. These separate pathways — including early athletic recruitment and the “Dean’s Interest List,” which came to light as part of the ongoing lawsuit of Students for Fair Admissions — are unjust, reflecting and perpetuating inequities from generation to generation. More importantly, they play a role in engineering class-based divisions between students — seeding the grounds for damaging divisions between students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
In particular, the study calls us to look critically at what it means to be an athlete on our campus. No doubt, athletes have worked hard to cultivate their skills and contribute a liveliness and depth to our campus culture that we would regret losing, not least when the Harvard-Yale Game rolls around each November. But we should also recognize that even athletic ability can be dependent on the resources made available during one’s childhood. Few can afford coaching in sailing; and certainly still fewer can afford the boat to sail on. Indeed, the study finds that only 3.2 percent of white admitted athletes can be considered economically disadvantaged. Just as we critique the financial resources that go into studying for the ACT and SAT, we should be conscious of how those same resources go into fostering and providing a nurturing environment for athletic talent.
We continue to believe that the best admissions process will look at each student as a complex whole, comprised of not only their academic proficiency and extracurricular intrigue, but also the background — in terms of privileges and challenges — that they come from. To that end, every student should be considered through the same process and apart from the pocketbooks of their parents or the colleges those parents attended. Though this study does not shock us per se; it reminds us of the significant work our University has left toward achieving the goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I yearn for the good old days of U.S. foreign policy. The days before the Berlin Wall fell and American statesmen would religiously consult with its allies and vanquish the “right” enemies. I miss when national security leaders from both parties worked with the president and devised a judicious strategy to contain the Soviet Union. Those were the days.
Except those days apparently never existed.
In 2014, former U.S. diplomat Stephen Sestanovich wrote the book “Maximalist: America in the World from Truman to Obama,” which argues that there has never been a cohesive grand American strategy of bipartisan consensus and global interdependence. In fact, Sestanovich believes U.S. foreign policy has alternated between two extremes: maximalism and retrenchment. Under former U.S. presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy ’40, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush, the aphorism, “If it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing,” seemed to encapsulate their foreign policy. When Soviet Russia threatened the American way of life, these presidents did not just strategically counter Russia’s geopolitical gains, they engaged in expensive arms races, divided Europe, entered protracted wars in Korea and Vietnam, and supported anticommunist resistance movements from Afghanistan’s mujahideen to Nicaragua’s “contras.”
When the maximalists go too far, “retrenchers” like Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama attempt to do less and withdraw from costly entanglements while reorienting America’s strategic interests. At some point, however, this caution and hesitancy poses a threat to American security, upon which another maximalist is elected.
If that’s the case, what’s Donald Trump? Writing in 2014, Sestanovich had the luxury of not tackling one of America’s most baffling presidents — especially with regards to foreign policy. On face value, if this maximalism-retrenchment pendulum holds up, Trump must be a maximalist because Obama embraced retrenchment when it came to the Middle East and the Pentagon’s budget.
But Trump’s doctrine seems far more complex. Sestanovich says that every maximalist president paid “keen attention to American power and influence.” If these presidents did not respond to certain provocations, then the U.S. could not “defend its interests in the future.” Trump seems to fit this description. In an effort to maintain American primary, Trump’s foreign policy revolves around “America First” as he rips up the Iran nuclear agreement because it was “the worst deal ever” for the U.S. Concurrently, he has started a vicious trade war with China, which he accused of “raping” the U.S. economy via the trade deficit, currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, or the fact that they are on track to surpass the U.S. on nearly all macroeconomic measures. These maximalist actions are contrasted with Trump’s professed desire to reduce America’s footprint in the Middle East and a doctrine of “disentanglement, retrenchment and realignment,” as New York Times columnist Ross G. Douthat ’02 described it.
While Trump made campaign promises to put “America First” he has also made bold, maximalist statements to foreign countries. He threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” and insinuated a military intervention in Venezuela. But when his threats of military actions or oil embargoes fail, Trump embraces retrenchment. He ignores the threats he once made and diverts his attention elsewhere. This is accompanied by retrenchment actions, such as reducing America’s troop presence in Syria or Afghanistan. Trump talks like a retrencher and walks like a maximalist. But he also talks like a maximalist and walks like a retrencher.
While “the good old days of U.S. foreign policy” were not perfectly harmonized, at least that generation of American statesmen, who experienced the horrors of World War II, recognized that free and democratic nations like the U.S. had a responsibility to protect the world from dangerous regimes and ideologies. The U.S. had to be involved in world affairs. Trump does not believe this. He subscribes to this increasingly popular doctrine: U.S. intervention and involvement is a waste of time and money and America needs to return home.
All hope, however, is not lost. Since Trump’s foreign policy approach is erratic, proponents of sensible and principled U.S. engagement need to remind the American people that the U.S. should not support freedom on a case-by-case basis or selfishly pursue its own interests or dismiss all multilateral organizations. America is committed to building a better world and thwarting those who upend such progress. We don’t have to ignore global interests just to make America first. In fact, by prioritizing global interests America can continue to be first — just like it has for the past 70 years. As Harvard students graduate and enter increasingly globalized professional environments, they should remember that there is no correct answer to how the U.S. should conduct foreign policy — Cold War strategy ebbed and flowed for 40 years. Successful policy, however, does have one requirement: it has to make sense in the moment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, I took the long way through the Science Center Plaza to pass Divest Harvard’s climate strike. I’d guess there were 200 strikers gathered around a thin young man with curly hair and sunglasses, who spoke from a platform. He was right on schedule, just a few minutes before noon, as he roused the sign-bearing students (alongside adults and kids too young to be in college): “Green! New! Deal! Green! New! Deal!”
Earlier that day The Crimson published a story about the Harvard Corporation’s ties to fossil fuel companies. In the grand scheme of Harvard’s suspicious financial relationships — Jeffrey E. Epstein, ties to Saudi Arabia, the Sacklers, etc. — the news wasn’t all that surprising, but it did strike me just how intimate these ties are.
Four of the 13 Corporation members have professional ties to the fossil fuel industry. One of them, Theodore V. Wells, who has recused himself from any Corporation deliberations on fossil fuel divestment since 2015, currently serves as lead counsel for ExxonMobil. Corporation member David M. Rubenstein invests in oil and gas projects through his private equity company The Carlyle Group, and has introduced the former ExxonMobil CEO at several speaking engagements in Washington, D.C.
The easy conclusion to draw here is that the Corporation — recusal or not —is significantly biased against fossil fuel divestment. But I find myself thinking about the predicament of University President Lawrence S. Bacow, caught between leadership and administration.
While Bacow has traditionally preferenced business-as-usual policies, less noted is his deeply personal sense of social justice. To be sure, his recent comparison of Harvard’s donor policies to the 13th Amendment was, as one anonymous staff member put it, “tone-deaf,” to say the least. Still, Bacow has time and time again shown a deep care for the social issues that affect the University and the world around it.
In his fall welcome email, for example, Bacow took the opportunity to express his personal stake in U.S. immigration policy. “Not just as a university president, but as the son of refugees and as a citizen who deeply believes in the American dream, I am disheartened by aspects of the proposed new criteria for people seeking to enter our country,” he wrote.
How we treat the displaced is personal — relevant to three facets of his identity — and he’s done more than talk about it. When a Harvard freshman was denied entry to the U.S. in the days before orientation, Bacow played an integral role in getting him to campus. The president of the nonprofit organization AMIDEAST, which sponsors the student’s studies, said of Bacow, “He was very much a stand-up guy on this issue and it's very much appreciated.”
Bacow is not a climate change denier, and he admits there’s work to do. But there’s something absent from his voice — some quality of sureness and authenticity that I’ve grown to associate with the tone of his presidency.
In a piece for Harvard Magazine, Bacow wrote, “Climate change poses an immediate and concrete test of whether we, as members of a university and responsible inhabitants of our planet, will fulfill a sacred obligation: to enable future generations to enjoy, as we are privileged to enjoy, the wonders of life on Earth.” Rarely have I heard a less convincing use of the phrase “sacred obligation” — pulled out of the abridged dictionary of climate change clichés, alongside “concrete test,” “responsible inhabitants,” and “wonders of life.”
Of course, Bacow cannot write as Gabrielle T. Langkilde ’21 so movingly did in a recent Crimson Editorial column. “[Harvard] claims to be a safe space for all,” she wrote, “but how can I feel safe when its very investments in the fossil fuel industry are contributing to the destruction of my home?” From her own personal anxiety, Langkilde makes a powerful claim about Harvard’s obligation to divest. It’s not an abstract duty but one to a very real portion of its community, whose homes are being threatened right now. Bacow does not have access to that same anxiety, and he certainly should not pretend he does.
But, then again, you’d think his words might reflect more awareness of these community members and their concerns. When writing to the University about changes to Title IX policy last semester, Bacow forefronted his own sense of awareness and responsibility: “The events of the past year have underscored for me and for many other people that great institutions must work to protect and defend the people who make them great.” None of us need claim status as a victim to find personal significance in the issue of sexual misconduct. The same should be true in the case of climate change. None of us should have to experience the devastation of natural disaster to believe that climate change implicates us personally, not least in terms of our moral complicity. But I find myself missing that personal commitment — one of Bacow’s greatest rhetorical strengths — in his statements on climate change. “We owe the future nothing less,” Bacow concludes the Harvard Magazine piece. It’s a pithy sentence, no doubt. But it leaves me wondering what it means for he himself. What makes Bacow — the University President, the son of immigrants, the engaged citizen — care about that future? And what is that future anyway?
My point, then, is a small one. Yes, I stand with Divest Harvard in calling on Bacow and the Corporation to divest from fossil fuels. And I agree that an important first step in that process is disclosing the extent of those investments — and perhaps, in doing so, dispelling some of the suspicion around the Corporation’s extensive ties to the industry. But even before that, I urge Bacow to make climate change not merely a global issue but a personal one.
Great leadership demands personal commitment. It’s a lesson that Bacow continues to teach me. As I left the strike, walking past the Science Center toward Kirkland Street, I couldn’t help picturing Bacow up on that platform, leading the community in its demand for action. What would that Harvard look like? President Bacow, that doesn’t have to be a fantasy.

Dozens of Harvard students and administrators gathered to remember and honor the life of Sandip Nirmel ’21 at a memorial service in Dunster House Sunday afternoon.
Nirmel died in May after an extended illness. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana described him as “deeply valued and loved” in a May 24 email to students.
Dunster Faculty Deans Sean D. Kelly and Cheryl K. Chen and Resident Dean Michael S. Uy hosted the memorial Sunday. Attendees were asked to share memories with each other and write messages to Nirmel’s family.
During the ceremony, music from Frédéric Chopin and Sergei Rachmaninoff played in the background. Kelly said Nirmel had enjoyed playing music from both composers on the piano. Kelly then spoke of Nirmel’s reputation as someone who contributed greatly to Dunster and the College overall.
At Harvard, Nirmel concentrated in Computer Science with a focus in Mind, Brain, and Behavior. Beyond academics, he was a case team leader for the Harvard College Consulting Group and vice chair of the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior.
Kelly and Chen wrote in a May email to Dunster residents that Nirmel was also an avid participant in intramurals, and that he could often be found in the House working on problem sets or eating breakfast with his friends.
At Sunday’s gathering, Uy spoke of his relationship with Nirmel, read remarks from Nirmel’s parents, and made note of resources available to students dealing with grief.
Several students said they remembered Nirmel as an optimist, hard-worker, and close friend. Some also spoke about their time with Nirmel in high school at the Harker School, as well as stories from college. Friends from high school shared light-hearted stories, recalling Nirmel’s sense of humor and positive attitude.
David Zhu ’21 recalled a memory of Nirmel participating in a relay race for a school spirit event in high school. Zhu said the last leg of the relay involved sticking marshmallows to school administrators’ faces, and that Nirmel took on the task with composure even after his team had lost.
“He was just so calm, so collected,” Zhu said. “He just kept on throwing the marshmallows and, eventually, they stuck.”
Dunster held a smaller gathering in May, though many students had already left campus because final exams had already ended. Kelly said they held the second gathering, in part, for those who were not able to attend the May event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two admissions cycles after Harvard Law School opened its Junior Deferral Program to non-Harvard students, the school is still looking to increase the number of applicants from public colleges and universities, the assistant dean for admissions said in an interview Monday.
The Junior Deferral Program — launched in 2014 — allows juniors in college to apply to Harvard Law School under the condition that, if accepted, they defer their admission for at least two years. Students who are rejected from the program may speak with a Law School admissions officer about their application. It was only open to Harvard undergraduates when it first launched, but it expanded to students from all undergraduate institutions in 2017.
Law School Assistant Dean for Admissions Kristi L. Jobson ’06 said the number of undergraduate institutions represented in the program is skewed toward private universities — both large and small.
“We're mindful that many, many thousands of college students in this country go to public schools. It's important to have a diversity of undergraduate institutions represented in the class,” Jobson, a former Crimson editor, said.
Of the 42 undergraduate institutions currently represented in the expanded JDP program’s cohort, seven are public, including Arizona State University; the University of California, Berkeley; McGill University; University of Georgia; University of Idaho; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; and the University of Texas, Austin.
In an effort to encourage students from across the country to apply, Jobson said staff in her office are planning to travel to more than 75 undergraduate institutions this year. Last year, the Law School traveled to 65 schools.
“We're trying to be mindful of visiting a lot of schools in new geographic regions that we haven’t visited before,” Jobson said. “Some examples for this year include Louisiana, Minnesota, and the Pacific Northwest.”
In addition to increasing their physical presence on campuses across the country, the Law School “revamped” its JDP website, created blog posts, and published videos detailing students’ experiences, Jobson said. They also held virtual information sessions specific to JDP applicants. So far they have held three virtual information sessions — two providing information for JDP applicants and one providing information for pre-law advisors.
“We hope that that enhanced online and virtual presence in addition to all of our recruitment efforts at various colleges are compelling,” Jobson said.
Jobson said the Law School will not release the individual admissions data for the program this year, as had been their practice in the past. She said, however, that the program is reflective of the regular admission JD class for the year they applied — including GRE scores, LSAT scores, and grade point averages.
“We don't necessarily have any caps in mind for JDP or any goal numbers,” Jobson said. “It's all going to always be reflective of the pool of applicants that we see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allston Land Company CEO Thomas P. Glynn III said Harvard hopes to emulate successes — and learn from challenges — with Kendall Square's recent development boom in planning for Harvard's Enterprise Research Campus.
Harvard established the ALC in fall 2018 to manage the ERC, a University project intended to facilitate collaborations between Harvard-affiliated research projects and “research-focused” companies. The project is set to initially occupy 14 acres of Harvard-owned land near the new School of Engineering and Applies Sciences campus in Allston, and may eventually span up to 36 acres.
Harvard opened a submission process for real estate developer proposals this summer, and has yet to makes its selection. Glynn said that his vision for the campus is to include residential buildings, green space, and public art pieces along with company offices.
“To Harvard students, the Enterprise Research Campus will offer them a chance for internships with cutting edge companies in life sciences, technology, and maybe other regions,” Glynn said.
“I think for the Allston Community, the things that it brings are, you know, more employment opportunities, and more opportunities for a lot of the work that Harvard has done over the years to make sure we have some win-win projects,” he added.
Glynn said that in developing the ERC, there are “lessons to be learned” from MIT’s Kendall Square development. He said that Harvard has advantages that will allow it to provide students, faculty, and Allston residents with a more complete set of amenities.
“We think that we have the advantage, since we own all the land, we can plan public realm and public art up front, which we think will make it a more hospitable, community-oriented campus at the end of the day, which was not a choice that MIT had,” Glynn said.
Concrete details of the ERC’s public artworks will not be determined until a developer is chosen, but Glynn brought up several examples installments that the ALC hopes to emulate.
“We've been doing a study of successful public realm art projects,” he said. “An example of that is 'The Bean' in Chicago.”
He said the ALC hopes to attract people to the new campus with the art that is selected.
“We want to make sure that we've gotten smart about what projects have been successful, what projects do create, you know, a magnet for citizens of all ages and all incomes," he said. "There are pretty things, but that doesn't mean that they really work for the public realm, you know, becoming kind of a magnet or making the project more of a destination."
Beyond public art and employment opportunities, the ERC plans to aside 20 percent of developed land as green-space.
“We're trying to make sure that we have something that everybody can be proud of,” Glynn said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s comments last week comparing Harvard’s relationship with donors to slavery, several campus organizations and affiliates have called for Bacow to support divestment of the University’s endowment from companies with ties to the prison system.
In a meeting last week with Alumni Affairs and Development staff, Bacow referred to the 13th Amendment while arguing that just as people cannot own slaves, Harvard’s schools cannot “own” their alumni and limit their donations to other schools. The comment upset some of the staff members present, and Bacow apologized for his comments Saturday in an email to meeting attendees.
“I regret that these comments caused offense. That certainly was not my intent,” Bacow wrote in the email. “I hoped to convey my belief that our collective job is to help our donors achieve their philanthropic objectives, which might include supporting activities in schools where they enjoyed no prior affiliation.”
Some student organizations drafted statements calling on Bacow to issue a more substantive apology after the Boston Globe first reported his analogy. They argued that Bacow could prove the sincerity of his apology by committing to prison divestment.
The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign condemned Bacow’s slavery comparison and wrote in a statement released on Twitter that Bacow’s words demonstrated he has a “crass understanding” of the legacy of slavery and its ties to the prison system — which they say is a continuation of slavery.
HPDC member Zoe L. Hopkins ’22 said in an interview that in light of his comments, Bacow should back divestment from the prison industry given its ties to the “legacies of violence” of slavery.
“If he had any understanding of this violence, and dared to step out of the ivory tower that is Massachusetts Hall, and look around...him, he would see the legacies of violence slavery has left behind,” Hopkins said. “And if he understood those legacies, he would have divested from prisons the moment he got here.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain did not respond to a request for comment.
The Harvard College Democrats released a statement Sunday morning that sharply criticized Bacow’s remarks, saying his comments “stand in diametric opposition to the values” of their organization and Harvard at large.
“At a time when Harvard must more fully reckon with its dark history of enabling and practicing slavery, it is unacceptable for its leader to compare alumni donors to enslaved persons and revised donor rules to the 13th Amendment,” the statement reads. “It’s time for him to make his apology real by divesting our institution from the prison-industrial complex.”
Harvard College Democrats President Henry “Hank” R. Sparks ’21 said the group issued a statement because they felt they had something to “add to the narrative” and wanted to reaffirm their call for Bacow to support prison divestment.
“We think that Bacow's comments sort of reflect an idea that slavery is something that happened in the past, and that has no bearing on today and so therefore, you can use it as an analogy whenever you want to,” Sparks said. “That isn't the case.”
Some University affiliates took to Twitter individually to criticize Bacow’s comments. Harvard Kennedy School Professor Khalil G. Muhammad wrote on Twitter that Bacow’s analogy comes as Harvard grapples with issues like ties to controversial donors and how it should invest its endowment. Muhammad referenced billionaire and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who gave nearly $9 million to the University; Harvard is currently reviewing those gifts.
“In light of other issues around fossil fuel divestment campaigns and prison divestment campaigns and some very unsavory, wealthy givers like Jeffrey Epstein, it just seems like the president needs to set a higher standard, in general, for how Harvard thinks about fundraising, and its relationship to wealthy people,” Muhammad said in an interview.
Clarification: Oct. 5, 2019
A previous version of this article stated that Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign is advocating for the University to divest from companies with ties to private prisons. To clarify, the group is advocating for the University to divest from all companies with ties to prisons, regardless of whether they are privately run.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge experienced more bike thefts in August than any other month thus far in 2019, following a larger trend in bike thefts in the city over the past five years, according to the Cambridge Police Department’s monthly crime report.
This past August, 82 bikes were reported stolen in Cambridge, a 21 percent increase from May, the month with the next highest volume of bike thefts. Of these thefts, 8 took place in Harvard Square.
CPD’s August report contextualized the rise in bike thefts within a one year and five year time frame. Bike thefts are up 73 percent — or 136 more incidents — this year compared with the first eight months of 2018. Over five years, bike thefts are up 48 percent — or 104 more incidents — compared with 2018.
On Harvard’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses, an average of 102 bike thefts occur per year, Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email.
“The thefts are fairly evenly distributed through campus with no one area experiencing a disproportionate amount versus another area,” he wrote.
Catalano confirmed there has been an increase in bike thefts in 2019 compared to this time last year. However, areas in direct proximity to the University experienced a 39 percent increase, compared to an estimated 73 percent spike across Cambridge.
Catalano noted that these statistics do not suggest there will be an increase in bike thefts overall by the year’s end. He wrote that HUPD’s “projected numbers” of bike thefts show effectively the same number in 2019 as 2018.
Chloe E.W. Levine ’22 brought her bike from home to school to get around campus, ride to work, and exercise. To store the bike, Levine said that she would lock it against a gate across from the Charles River in the courtyard between Winthrop House buildings. On Sept. 21, however, it was stolen.
Levine said the way she locked the bike was not to blame.
“I’m from New York so I know how to lock my bike really carefully. There was a really heavy duty lock cord going through both wheels and the frame and my helmet,” she said.
Experiences like Levine’s persuaded Jack O. Luby ’20, who keeps a bike on campus for “fitness,” to store his bike indoors.
“I store my bike in my room. I’m worried it might get stolen or broken,” he said.
As for Levine, she said that she has not decided if she is going to invest in another bike.
“I need to think long and hard...about whether or not I’m willing to take the risk of having it be stolen again,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a pair of high-profile podium finishes over the weekend, the Harvard sailing team hopes that it has finally found its groove.
The Crimson picked up its first regatta victory of the season at the Danmark Trophy and finished second at the Women’s Showcase, which both took place in New London, Conn., over the weekend. The two podium finishes highlighted Harvard sailing’s most successful weekend yet this Fall. The first and second place showings are the top two results the Crimson has posted this year. It is just the third time in the last two years that Harvard has posted multiple podium finishes in different regattas during the same weekend.
“Our execution was good, our speed was good, our handling is really improving,” Harvard coach Michael O’Connor said. “We were very happy with the results.”
At the Danmark Trophy, junior captain Henry Burnes and senior Iulianna Taritsa blew away their competition in the B-Division, finishing a whopping 36 points in front of second-place Yale. Burnes and Taritsa scored 69 points over the regatta’s 18 races.
In the trophy’s A-Division, junior Eli Burnes, junior Emily Wang, and sophomore Eric Hansen finished in third place, with 130 total points — an average score of 7.2. The trio won five of the regatta’s 18 races, including a crucial victory in the final set.
“Going into the last few races, we knew that St. Mary’s was a little bit ahead of us,” Eli Burnes said. “We knew we had to beat them just a little bit in the last few races to win the regatta overall.”
In the Women’s Showcase, sophomore Emma Kaneti and junior Emma Jakobson won the A-Division by 16 points. The Crimson looked to be on track to win the regatta, but a last-place finish by Harvard’s B-Division boat in the regatta’s final race pushed them into second place overall, just four points behind Yale.
“We came really close to winning the [Women’s Showcase],” O’Connor said. “We had a little bit of bad luck at the end of the final race but they sailed well enough to win. Next time they sail that well, I’m confident they will.”
With the performances over the weekend, the Crimson established itself as able to compete — and win — in a big, interconference regatta. The question remains, however, as to whether or not they can keep it up. Prior to this week, Harvard had posted just two podium finishes and struggled at times to carry momentum forward.
“I think it’s a weekend where we really began to achieve our potential, but we have a lot of work left to do and we’re hoping to build on it,” O’Connor said.
Emily Wang and Eli Burnes, who hadn’t raced together prior to this season, have led the Crimson so far this year. Kaneti and Jakobson, the Crimson’s other top pair, “have picked up where they left off,” according to O’Connor.
“We’re very happy with the progress that our team is making,” O’Connor said. “Everybody is working hard towards our team goals. We’ve had some good performances on the weekends, but we have not been consistent enough yet. If we can get to the point where our execution, particularly on the starting line, is consistently good, we have a great deal of potential.”
Burnes, a philosophy concentrator, is coming off a successful sophomore season last year in which he was named an honorable mention on Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association’s All-American team.
“Eli is a very smart sailor,” O’Connor said. “He’s fast in a wide range of positions. He’s a really fun person to sail with. He’s really got a ton of potential, he just needs to be a little bit more consistent.”
Harvard features eight first-years on their roster, including several who are sailing competitively for the first time. Following the graduation of several small crews last spring, Eli Burnes says the upperclassmen put on “a full-court press to get freshmen to join the sailing team.”
“This year, we knew we’d have to train a lot of walk-ons,” Burnes said. “We basically just started to talk to as many people as possible at the activities fair. We had people talk to any freshman they knew.”
When first-year Chris Wang arrived on campus, he had “no idea” that sailing would become such a big part of his freshman experience. Wang was drawn to the team because he wanted to fulfill a life-long dream of his father’s, who has a passion for boats but has never had the opportunity to take up sailing seriously.
“My dad’s extremely happy that I’m doing it,” Wang said. “I felt like I was fulfilling a family goal because my dad never got to go through with it.”
There are three regatta weekends remaining in the fall season before the ICSA Singlehanded Championships on November 9.
“This is definitely a huge confidence-booster,” Eli Burnes said. “Great for momentum for the rest of the season.”

Isn't it funny
How a bear likes honey?
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
I wonder why he does?
-A. A. Milne, “The Complete Tales of Winnie-the-Pooh”
Within the first chapter of A. A. Milne’s “The Complete Tales of Winnie-the-Pooh,” a literary masterpiece in and of itself, America’s favorite bear finds himself caught in a peculiar predicament. Our buddy Pooh, having just heard a strange reverberating ring, struggles profusely to determine the source – and, more importantly, the meaning – of the sound. Suddenly, he exclaims that "that buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something.”
This past Friday, the Brown Bears found themselves in a similar situation. Sure, though the two bears may have differed in color and intention, both were subject to a constant droning sound – Pooh to the humming of bees (to the eventual surprise of both him and his readers), and the players from Providence to the buzz of the scoreboard, a sound that echoed throughout Harvard Stadium as the Crimson brought the ball to the endzone six times.
Under the field’s Friday night lights, Harvard swamped Brown, holding the Bears to a single touchdown as they scored six of their own. However, in the musings of Winnie-the-Pooh, this sound and eventual victory must “mean something.” Well, Winnie, you’re right: here’s what we took away from this weekend’s Crimson triumph.
THE MAN, THE SMYTH, THE LEGEND
In 2017, Harvard quarterback Jake Smith became the first freshman to start at that position in over a decade. In the years that followed, Smith’s relationship with the starting slot became a little more rocky – the Ithaca, Mich., native completed only four touchdowns over the course of his sophomore year.
This season, however, seems to be different for Smith. The junior matched his sophomore-year points total over the course of the Brown game alone, throwing for a career-best four touchdowns. Halfway through the third-quarter, Smith, trapped in the pocket, launched a 34-yard, endzone-bound bomb to receiver BJ Watson, cementing his record, the game, and the title of Comeback Kid.
“It’s exciting when you set a personal record, but I’m not nearly as excited about that as coming out here in a home game with a strong W,” Smith said. “I love how the team responded and I can’t wait to continue the season.”
THE COACH’S APPROACH
In travelling from one bookend of America to the other, Harvard not only changed time zones, but it returned home – a much needed location-swap for the competitors in crimson. The difference in Harvard’s gameplay wasn’t all that evident in the first fifteen minutes of its contest against the Bears, but the latter three quarters saw a much more aggressive team. Crimson coach Tim Murphy cites his staff as some of the main players in propelling that change.
“The first half of our first quarter was very similar to our first quarter against San Diego,” Murphy said. “We struggled a bit out of the gate, but I thought our coaches did a great job getting us doing what we needed to do.”
The Crimson’s late-game aggression could be seen in the squad’s third-down strategy, as Harvard’s performance on the endzone-front was matched by the quality of its late-in-the-drive executions. On 9-of-13 conversion attempts, the Crimson gained the first-down. Compare this to 3-for-11 on the side of the Bears.
It was clear throughout the game that Murphy was playing to win, with his team’s five second-half touchdowns completely unmatched by its competitors. This trend is bound to continue in coming contests. After this victory, Murphy is only five games away from setting the record for all-time Ivy League wins.
THE (MANY, MANY) NAMES OF THE GAME
As the ancient song goes, ten Thousand Men of Harvard want victory today; for they know that ov'r old Eli, fair Harvard holds sway. Now, the Crimson may not boast a count of competitors that hits the quintuple-digits, and I’m not exactly sure who Old Eli is, but based on this weekend’s receiving stats, there are certainly quite a few Harvard men who “want victory today.”
Jake Smith may have been the star of the Crimson’s contest against the Bears, but his receiving corps certainly garnered a few honorable mentions. Each of Harvard’s six touchdowns was tabbed by a different man, making for quite the versatile offense.
With a minute left in the first quarter, senior receiver Cody Chrest nabbed a 12-yard pass from Smith. Upperclassmen Jack Cook and Adam West cooked up the perfect storm in the second quarter, easily tripling the Crimson’s point total.
The next fifteen minutes saw the train of triumph speed, with running back BJ Watson snagging a touchdown pass. In the final quarter of the contest, the Crimson traded its gloves for cleats, albeit for the same results – running backs Devin Darrington and Aidan Borguet took a pair of tumbles into the endzone.

Dear Overly Excited Freshmen Who Are Out to Party,
First of all, the “Iceberg” actually does not exist; it is in fact the Igloo that you are looking for. We were all in your place not too long ago, so we get the struggle — Quad Houses can be confusing to navigate, especially the Pfoho basement. So if you approach an upperclassmen working on a pset in the dhall or walking around in their pajamas, they’ll (hopefully) try to give you the clearest directions possible, or may even walk you over to the Igloo (or Belltower, or Aquarium, or Treehouse, or wherever else you are trying to find).
A word of advice: please don’t bash the Quad as you’re walking through the halls of Pfoho, Cabot, or Currier, especially if you’re counting on the kindness of upperclassmen to help you navigate. This is our home, a place that we love and hope that you do too! It may come as a shock, but keep in mind that there are residents of the houses who actually hope to get some work done on a Friday night. Especially — and I cannot stress this enough — do not run past the libraries screaming that whoever is doing work on a weekend night is a loser, because you sound like a middle schooler. No joke. I have three midterms and a presentation next week. I don’t want to be in the library either, trust me.
However, we do want you to have a fun night! Belt out the lyrics of “Mr. Brightside” to your heart's content (just not in the halls). Jump from party to party to explore all of the spaces that the Quad has to offer! All we ask is that you be respectful to the residents around you — trying to do laundry on a Sunday morning only to find puke in the washing machine is not a pleasant way to start your day.
If you do eventually find your way to the Igloo (located in Holmes basement in Pfoho, btw), congratulations. Take a chance to look at the beautiful Quad Lawn before you dash off to your next location, and see you next weekend.
Best Wishes,
The Upperclassmen Getting Tea From the Dhall That You Pass On Your Way to the Igloo

In the midst of a heavily packed weekend of social fitness activities at Boston’s 4th Annual Social Fitness Festival, Dance Mile was a sight to see, high in attendance and high in spirits. Boston’s Social Fitness Festival is an annual free celebration of getting Boston moving, sponsored by Mayor Martin J. Walsh and hosted this year in City Hall Plaza on Sept. 14, 2019. Hosting events including Sweat Remix, CorePower Yoga, BollyX Workout, and Daybreaker, the festival attempts to encourage active lifestyles in Boston by exposing local residents to fitness-based activities. Dance Mile is a social fitness experience which encourages people to “grab your crew, don your costumes, and crush a mile of serious booty shaking.”
Rebecca T. Pham, an instructor at 305 Fitness in Boston, leads the attendees of Boston Social Fitness Festival in an active workout to prepare for the Dance Mile. To increase spirit and energy for the dance mile around downtown Boston, various hip-hop fitness experiences are hosted in City Hall Plaza before commencing the mile.
((305)) Fitness “is a ‘rave-meets-workout’ non-stop dance workout with a live DJ and a light show. Immediately after getting off the T in Government Center, the crowd of people participating in this “non-stop fun” is overwhelming and exhilarating. Following the lead of active instructors, the crowd was fully engaged and torching calories away as they #madesweatsexy.
Participants line up at the front of the group in preparation to dance for a mile on closed-off city streets behind a massive bedazzled float blasting modern music immersed in a cloud of bubbles. Donning bright neon clothing, dancers are visibly excited and jumping up and down eager to begin.
The Dance Mile promises “5280 feet of pure awesomeness.” Under the rules section on their website, they insist in all caps to “HAVE THE MOST FUN POSSIBLE.” Dance Mile promotes the experience as “all about fun, dancing, and celebrating the CITY YOU LIVE IN!” Led by local dancer Sylver Rochelin, the float started its journey by leaving City Hall Plaza and entering the streets of downtown Boston.
Angela Gentile (right), the owner of Sweat Remix and the emcee of Dance Mile, dances through the streets of downtown Boston, breaking it down to popular dance hits. Sweat Remix, an event at the Boston Social Fitness Festival, is a 45-minute “wellness remix of heart-pumping fitness and soul-feeding meditation”.
Erin F. Griffin and Ellen Dunn dance down the streets while belting out the lyrics of classic hits like Smash Mouth’s “All Star” and Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)”.
Soraya G. Pierre-Louis and Lola L. Owen, both third years at Northeastern University, spend their Saturday afternoon away from the library, movin’ and groovin’ through the streets surrounding City Hall Plaza.
The interactive dance parade, after moving at one mile per hour down a closed loop, concluded by returning to City Hall Plaza for a finish line dance party. While a large crowd danced the mile, very few stayed for the events afterward; the Dance Mile was the main event.
