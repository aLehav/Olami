After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With anything new, there will likely be kinks, and the inaugural Ivy League Tournament is not exempt from that phenomenon. But despite the quirks and potential adjustments, both Tommy Amaker, coach of the Harvard men’s basketball team, and Kathy Delaney-Smith, coach of the Harvard women’s basketball team, are glad the tournament finally became a reality this year.
Given their respective records in conference play, 10-4 for the men and 8-6 for the women, the Crimson basketball season would have been over as the last whistle blew for each team last Saturday against Penn. But instead, they’re still alive.
“We’re so excited to be here,” Delaney-Smith said. “Especially we’re happy because we didn’t come in first and we wanted another shot to go against Penn and Princeton and Brown.”
The tournament also represents a clean slate for both squads. Both Amaker and Delaney-Smith’s teams were swept in their final weekend playing Princeton and Penn, the other two schools who are represented on both the men’s and women’s sides of the tournament (Yale rounds the group out for the men, Brown for the women).
On both the men’s and women’s side of the tournament, the number one seed ran away with the regular season title, with both Princeton for the men and Penn for the women holding a four point buffer over the number two seed on each side. But don’t tell Delaney-Smith her team is an underdog..
“I’ve been part of an upset a million years ago and there’s nothing like it,” Delaney-Smith said. “I’m a believer in the underdog so I—and this team knows—I didn’t care what seed I was or who I play in the first round. This is a new season for every team that’s here and you know the cards are going to fall where they fall and that’s fun.”
The upset Delaney-Smith was referencing came in 1998 when the Crimson became the only 16-seed to defeat a one-seed in NCAA Tournament history, men’s or women’s, when the team defeated Stanford.
The women’s team will get a chance to bounce back right away from last weekend, as it faces a rematch against Princeton. In two contests this season against the Tigers, the Crimson fell by five points on the road and just four points at home, with the first contest at Jadwin Gym going into overtime.
The men’s team finished the regular season in heartbreaking fashion, losing both games on last second shots by the Tigers and Quakers on back-to-back nights. Penn’s Jackson Donahue hit a three with 1.1 seconds to go on Saturday, sending Harvard home with an “L” and clinching a spot in the tournament for Penn.
“It doesn’t matter how you’re coming into a tournament, whether you’ve played well or for us in particular we’re coming off two losses our two previous games,” Amaker said. “What matters is what you do within the tournament. That’s the theory, that’s the philosophy that we’ve had and it’s worked well for in the past in any tournaments I’ve played in and have coached in.”
Both coaches brought up commentary in response to questions about whether the tournament is correctly formatted or being held in the right place, but both had overall positive reviews of the Ancient Eight’s first venture into tournament basketball. While both coaches noted they would have preferred if the tournament included all eight teams, Amaker reinforced the decision to hold the event at the Palestra despite concerns about Penn having a home-court advantage, while Delaney-Smith applauded the league for creating an exciting event creating buzz around Ivy League basketball.
“I think this weekend with all four teams on the women’s side and on the men’s side actually, anybody can beat anybody,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s what makes this March Madness really fun. Who doesn’t love that?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard basketball this year it hasn’t been a matter of pure freshman talent or veteran senior experience—in fact for the most part, it’s been a lot of both.
For the men it’s been a tale of two guards. Led by co-captain Siyani Chambers and freshman Bryce Aiken, the Crimson have what is arguably one of the best backcourts in the conference. The two have combined to average 24.1 points and 8.8 dimes per game.
As of Wednesday, Aiken has followed in the steps of Chambers as he was voted the Ivy League Rookie of the Year, with Chambers earning the honor after the 2012-2013 season. The duo was also given first-team All-Ivy nods.
On the women’s side, it’s a similar story. For coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s squad it’s been a combination of co-captain Destiny Nunley and freshman guard Katie Benzan.
Benzan, while coming just short of Rookie of the Year behind Princeton’s Bella Alarie, was given a first-team All-Ivy nod while Nunley earned an Honorable Mention All-Ivy.
For women’s coach Kathy Delaney Smith, the talent is something that isn’t exclusive to her squad, it’s across the league.
“I’ve said all year long the league is the strongest—I’ve been in it 35 years, I know I don’t look that old, but it’s the strongest in my 35 years,” Delaney-Smith said. “This is the strongest top to bottom it’s ever been.”
IVY LEAGUE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR: BRYCE AIKEN
Despite coming off the bench for the better part of the Crimson’s season, Aiken has become  all but a bench player for the Crimson—he has instead become a staple of the Harvard offense.
In a class full of freshman talent with teammate Seth Towns, Yale’s Miye Oni, Columbia’s Mike Smith, and Penn’s AJ Brodeur, Aiken’s campaign has been nothing short of spectacular. The freshman leads the Crimson in scoring with 14 points a game.
As the Crimson takes on Yale tomorrow, Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker will likely look to the freshman in hopes of a third win against the Bulldogs this season.
“Bryce is a good player,” Amaker said. “No matter who we’ve played he’s been a focal point for our opponents. I’m sure that’s going to take place again. Yale did do that in the earlier games, Bryce has been a very good ball player for us and we’re going to need him to be really good again.”
It would be hard to pick the best game of the rookie’s season—perhaps it would be a series of back-to-back threes late to give the Crimson its best non-conference win of the season against Houston or maybe it would be the 27 points he dropped against Yale in New Haven to hand the Bulldogs their first home loss in nearly two years.
Either way, Aiken will likely be headache for Ivy League for years to come.
FIRST TEAM ALL-IVY: KATIE BENZAN
On a team full of talented guards, Benzan has proven she’s the one Delaney-Smith can count on—so much so that last weekend against Penn and Princeton the guard played a full forty minutes in both contests.
Benzan leads the Crimson in scoring and assists  with 13.6 points and a conference-leading 4.1 assists per game while shooting 40 percent from the field. She has also put up a team-best 21 points in double figures this season.
The freshman has also established herself as a threat from deep. She ranks first in the Ivy League in three pointers made per game at 2.9 while shooting .395 from long range.
Before earning the end-of-season All-Ivy honor, Benzan nabbed six Ivy Rookie of the Week honors, along with earning the Player of the Week honor on Jan. 2.
FIRST TEAM ALL-IVY: SIYANI CHAMBERS
After taking a voluntary leave of absence to preserve his last year of eligibility following an ACL injury during the summer of 2015, Chambers has come back in spectacular fashion. Despite the emergence of Aiken, the co-captain has continued to lead the Crimson. Always among the most emphatic of the Crimson squad, Chambers is no stranger to the success as this is his fourth All-Ivy selection.
“We go as [Siyani] goes,” Amaker said. “And I’m proud of what he’s been able to accomplish coming back off a season ending knee injury and to be voted first team all league his final year, really neat things going on for our basketball team and certainly an opportunity to continue that this weekend.”
Coming into what will be his last weekend of Ivy League basketball, the senior sits at second in all time assists and 7th in all-time in three point field goals among Harvard players.
The Minnesota native has earned All-Ivy honors in each of his four seasons in Cambridge, landing a spot on the first team in his freshman and senior campaigns and on the second team his sophomore and junior years.
HONORABLE MENTION ALL-IVY: DESTINY NUNLEY
Despite only playing limited minutes behind standout forward AnnMarie Healy last season, Nunley has become a force to be reckoned with this season.
Nunley comes in averaging 11.4 points and a team-high 7.4 rebounds per game, good for fourth best in the Ivy League. On a guard heavy squad, the Crimson has looked to Nunley for production on both ends of the floor—the senior has added nearly two blocks a game while shooting over 40 percent from the field.
As the Crimson take on a substantially tall Princeton squad tomorrow, all eyes will be on Nunley for the Crimson. While even the 6’1’’ Texas native will be outsized by the Tigers’ frontcourt, Nunley is confident in her and her teammates’ ability to evade the struggles of a size differential.
“You throw a shot fake, you throw her off her feet, you just have to put your smart cap on and put some IQ in your head and play around that,” Nunley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prior to Friday, more than four months had elapsed since the Harvard men’s hockey team last trailed at the end of two periods within its own building. Yet by the time the zamboni took the ice for its second circuit during the Crimson's 2017 playoff opener, Harvard found itself down 4-3 to rival Yale in Game 1 of the ECAC quarterfinals.
At one point, the hosts had led 2-0. But in the words of Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, the Crimson played “too loose," eventually falling behind for the first time at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in more than 277 minutes of Alston action.
But with a perfect 11-0-2 home record to preserve, the conference favorites rose to the occasion in the game’s final frame, riding three unanswered third-period goals to a 6-4 come-from-behind victory. Now a winner of 11 straight games, No. 2 Harvard (23-5-2, 16-4-2) stands one game from punching its third ticket in as many seasons to the ECAC semifinals in Lake Placid, New York.
“I thought it was a good gut check for us coming into the third,” Donato said. “We had some guys step up, and we’re happy to get the win. We knew it was going to be a grind, and it was. Hopefully we’ll come out with a little better game tomorrow as far as our attention to detail and fundamentals.”
Capping a career night in which he logged a point on each of the Crimson’s first four scores, senior Sean Malone set up the final equalizer 48 seconds into the third period. The Buffalo Sabres draft pick skipped past third-pair defenseman Charlie Curti by the attacking blue line to set up a 2-on-1 with classmate and linemate Tyler Moy, who punched in his 17th goal of the season on Malone’s right.
With Harvard skating on the man advantage seven minutes later, co-captain Alexander Kerfoot tipped in the winner from sophomore goaltender Sam Tucker’s left post. Freshman defenseman Adam Fox’s point drive shot off the stick of the senior center straight for the top shelf.
Sophomore Lewis Zerter-Gossage would also fire a high-slot wrister into the top right corner at 7:49, but the Crimson’s first five goals were scored exclusively by Harvard’s most veteran class—the highest-scoring collection of seniors in the country. All three members of Donato’s second line of seniors—Malone, Moy, and Luke Esposito—finished plus-three, combining for a staggering nine points.
“As seniors, it’s our last kick of the can here,” Malone said. “We really wanted to emphasize hard work and everything, and we were able to show up on the scoresheet quite a bit. It’s a nice feeling.”
“I thought Sean Malone was flying tonight,” Donato said. “That line was so effective that it carried us through some mistakes that we made earlier in the game.”
Those mistakes initially erased the 2-0 Harvard edge that had been built up by Malone and Esposito over the opening 22 minutes. In a span of just 2:41, the Bulldogs (13-14-5, 7-11-4) lit the lamp three consecutive times midway through the second period to hand the Crimson its first home deficit since Jan. 21—when Harvard last met Yale at the Bright no less.
First, sophomore Joe Snively backhanded a loose puck into the cage from the side of the net on the power play at 8:03. About a minute later, senior Mike Doherty’s short-side wrister from the top of the slot beat the glove of junior Merrick Madsen (24 saves) to tie the game. And shortly thereafter, freshman Luke Stevens snuck onto the doorstep to knock in the Bulldogs’ third goal of the period.
“I just thought we were loose in a lot of areas and turned some pucks over,” Donato said. “I give Yale a lot of credit, but I think we enabled too much out there.”
Nonetheless, just as he did in Harvard’s aforementioned January matchup with Yale, Esposito generated an equalizer. The senior netted his second goal of the night from the low slot on the man advantage, tying the game at three with 3:59 to go in the second before going celebrating into the boards.
Less than a minute later, however, Snively too netted his second goal of the evening. Cherry-picking at the attacking blue line, the Bulldogs’ leading point-getter collected a zone-to-zone feed from junior defenseman Adam Larkin and walked in alone on Madsen, whom he beat with a wrister to put Yale back in front.
That 4-3 edge would carry into the second intermission, but the Crimson’s three-goal third put the hosts in position to potentially close out the series Saturday night. Any chance of a Bulldog comeback was effectively squashed with 2:40 remaining in regulation when senior Chris Izmirlian was sent to the box for interfering with Malone—a call Yale coach Keith Allain expressed his displeasure with from the bench. Allain declined to speak to reporters after the game.
The Bulldogs now need a win in the second game of the series Saturday night in order to not only keep their season alive, but also to avoid—at least for the time being—their first losing season in 10 years. Puck drop is set for just after 7 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 18, 2017 at 3:42 p.m.
All season, the Harvard men’s basketball team has been a study in the art of a comeback. The team has found itself on both ends of comebacks, including a collection of heartbreakers in the final games of the season. On Saturday night, it looked like the team had a chance to reverse its luck in buzzer beaters, but that wouldn’t be the case.
Freshman guard Bryce Aiken did everything he could to will the Harvard men’s basketball team to the Ivy League Tournament finale, but his 28 point effort wasn’t enough to overcome Harvard’s cold shooting. After beating Yale (18-10) in its first two contests of the regular season, the Bulldogs upset the Crimson, 73-71.

Though Harvard (18-10)  trailed for 58 minutes of the contest, including by as many as 13 in the second half, the Crimson had life in the waning minutes. Trailing by five with 1:31 to go, Aiken got the ball at the top of the arc and dared Yale senior Sam Downey to stop him, but the 6’9’’ Downey couldn’t stop 6’0’’ Aiken and the Harvard rookie pulled his team within two. After a timeout, Harvard co-captain Siyani Chambers fouled Bulldog sophomore Trey Phills, who hit 1-of-2 free throws, but gave the Crimson the ball back with 21 seconds to go.
Yale knew Harvard would be looking for Aiken, and it was right. The Crimson got Aiken the ball and he put up a deep three that was no good. A long rebound was tipped out of bounds by the Bulldogs, giving Harvard another shot at a tie with 10.6 seconds on the clock.
Freshman forward Seth Towns inbounded the pass to senior center Zena Edosomwan, who simultaneously set a screen and handed the ball off to Chambers in the corner. Chambers was once again looking for Aiken’s hot hand. But once again, Yale knew it was coming, and Bulldog freshman Jordan Bruner intercepted Chambers’ skip pass.
“I’m pretty sure everyone on the floor knew Bryce was getting the ball,” Bruner said.
Bruner then iced the game with a free throw with six ticks on the clock, putting Harvard down four points. Edosomwan would get the last bucket of the game off an offensive rebound recovered after an Aiken miss, but all Yale had to do was inbound cleanly to seal the victory.
“You have to congratulate Yale for a tremendous effort on their part,” Amaker said. “I thought they played with great poise, made the necessary plays to close the game out but certainly our kids deserve a lot of credit for competing very hard.”
While Aiken was red hot, the rest of the Crimson roster couldn’t buy a basket. Though Harvard came into the game with the best offense in conference play, the Bulldogs held the Crimson to just 35.1 percent shooting from the floor. Even Aiken, who took the Harvard offense over, shot an inefficient 11-for-25. Most notably however was the poor shooting of freshman Seth Towns and sophomore Corey Johnson, who shot a combined 3-for-24, including 2-of-16 from behind the arc.
“We just didn’t have an opportunity to finish and convert in the moments when we had to,” Amaker said. “We were open, we had open threes and we wanted to take them, that’s how we’ve gotten to this point but we certainly didn’t have it this afternoon.”
It took nearly three minutes for Harvard to get on the board in the contest. The team started 0-for-5 from the floor until freshman forward Chris Lewis cleaned up a Towns miss under the basket.
Coming into the weekend, Amaker noted a few keys to the game for Harvard success—rebounding and slowing down Yale sophomore Alex Copeland were two big ones.
The team succeeded on the first of those notes, outrebounding the Bulldogs 46-43 in the contest despite the size and skill of the Yale front line and the length of its starting backcourt. Edosomwan had 13 rebounds on the day, a near even split between offense and defense.
The team struggled to slow Copeland in the first frame, however. In all three games of the series against Yale this year, Copeland and Aiken have traded baskets and faced each other on defense and in the first half on Saturday, Copeland was winning the battle. Copeland finished the half with 12 points compared to eight for Aiken.

But in the second half, Aiken came alive, including a stretch in which the rookie had 12 of Harvard’s 15 points over a four-minute period. The scoring came in a combination of step-back jumpers and drives through the paint. Only one of Aiken’s buckets was assisted, while Harvard registered an assist on nine of its other 16 field goal makes.
“He’s a creative shot maker and playmaker and we needed him to do exactly that,” Amaker said.”I thought he did a tremendous job of putting us in position to have an opportunity to pull it out. We wouldn’t have even been close if he wasn’t able to have some heroic shots and big plays that he made for our team.”
Though the Crimson fell short on Saturday, this likely isn’t the last time that Harvard will find itself playing this late in March. While Towns had an off night, freshman forward Chris Lewis stepped up with 13 points on 5-of-7 shooting and freshman guard Justin Bassey has been a defensive presence all season.
“I think the potential is very high,” Chambers said. “As you can see, Bryce stepped up again today like he’s done a countless number of times this season. Seth had an off-night but he’ll pick it back up. Our guys, like all the freshmen in the league, are very talented and when they come to maturation down the line in a couple years it’s going to be crazy what their potential is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 18, 2017 at 3:44 p.m.
PHILADELPHIA—It started innocuously.
Just over five minutes into the second quarter Princeton senior guard Vanessa Smith made the second of her two free throws to give the Tigers a 17-16 lead.
Her free throw was the first of 13 Princeton points that went uncontested from the Crimson. Over that span of over five minutes Harvard missed seven shots and coughed up the ball twice.
For a Crimson squad (15-13) that lives beyond the perimeter, the shots just weren’t falling against Princeton (16-12) on Saturday night at the Palestra. Playing for a spot in the Ivy League Championship game, head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s squad simply couldn’t get the offense going—they were outscored every quarter of the game and in a tough shooting second quarter only put up five points on 2-of-14 shooting from the field.
“I mean you always credit the defense but at times yes, but at times, no, it wasn’t the defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “It was we just didn’t make our shots.”
The rough shooting ultimately doomed Harvard as a 24-point third quarter extended the Tigers’ lead and gave them the 68-47 win to advance to the championship game of the Ivy League tournament.

What ended as a blowout began as a tenacious defensive effort on both sides. In the first quarter neither team shot over 40 percent from the field and no player other than freshman forward Bella Alarie made more than a single field goal.
Alarie’s five first quarter points and three rebounds was only be a preview of what was to come, however. She finished the night with a game-high 17 points and 16 rebounds.
Fueled by Alarie’s effort in the paint, Princeton took off in the second and third quarters. Going on an 18-2 run at one point, the Crimson struggled to get rebounds or score late in the third—shooting 8-of-17 through that period, the Tigers extended their lead as high as 19.
“The third quarter was terrible, that’s where they stretched it,” Delaney-Smith said. “Our defense played really hard…I thought our team did a great job for the most part except for the early part of the third quarter where they stretched it and those were just fundamental errors, letting them beat us on the drive and letting them get offensive boards and then fouling them.”
Alarie wasn’t the only player with a double-double as junior forward Leslie Robinson also had a standout night for Princeton. She would add another 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Tigers. Despite only shooting 3-of-8 from the field, Robinson went to the line for nine points on 12 free throw attempts.
The two spearheaded Princeton’s effort on the glass—on the game, the Tigers outrebounded Harvard 47 to 35. No Crimson player recorded more than six rebounds.
Freshman Katie Benzan, a staple of Harvard offense and its leading scorer, was quiet throughout the game. Often being pressed by sophomore guard Sydney Jordan, Benzan simply couldn’t get it going on offense. She finished the game with eight points on 3-of-11 shooting from the field.
“Katie is the kind of player that, she actually can create her own shot but she’s five foot four, really, let’s call a spade a spade,” Delaney-Smith said. “If your intention is to stop someone like that from scoring, you can. They did it well by switching all screens. What we didn’t do well is punish them for that.”
In the fourth quarter, the Crimson made a late run at the Tigers—pressing for most of the quarter, Harvard forced six turnovers. Scoring on three possessions in a row while holding Princeton scoreless over the same span, the Crimson pulled within 10 points with just over six minutes left on the clock.

Despite coming close late, Harvard fell into another slump to close out the game—after a Benzan jumper cut it to 10 with 6:10 on the clock, the Crimson was held without a field goal for the next four and a half minutes. In that span the Tigers scored 12 while Harvard made only a free throw.
“We couldn’t get the ball in the basket and they would get a rebound and we’re right back where we started,” co-captain Destiny Nunley said. “I think that it just seems like the recurring theme is that we just really needed to score.”
