Madras Dosa Co. Brings a Dose of Dosa to Harvard Square
Glancing down a corridor of first-floor galleries at the Harvard Art Museums, visitors may catch an unexpected glimpse of one of the museums’ newest residents: A gilded clay sphere is stationed on the floor of the gallery space, creating an otherworldly effect from its elemental interaction with the gallery’s natural light. Following its beckon deeper into the galleries, visitors encounter several more clay spheres of varying sizes and finishes — some are adorned with 17-karat-gold, others remain as warm-toned, earthy unglazed clay.
This site-specific installation, titled “Origen,” is the work of renowned Mexico City contemporary artist Bosco Sodi. Organized by Houghton Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art Mary Schneider Enriquez, the installation has been in the works since the pandemic and features 14 handmade clay spheres. Three golden pieces of the exhibit are making their U.S. debut at Harvard, and 12 of the spheres sit outdoors in the first terrace display in Harvard Art Museums’ history.
Each sphere is the product of an extensive process of creation which attaches the forces and elements of nature to the physical art. After sculpting the spheres from Oaxaca clay with local artists, Sodi allows the spheres to dry for nearly a year before baking them in an outdoor kiln on the banks of the Pacific. The result is a manifestation of centuries-old Zapotec terracotta sculpture tradition and the effects of today’s natural processes. Cracks, indentations, and color variations in the clay surface demonstrate the natural mutability and individuality of every piece Sodi creates.
“Origen” means “source” in Spanish, evoking a sense of centrality and beginning in both the clay globes’ materials and spiritual connotations. Though installed within a modern context, the spheres’ origin can be traced back to age-old traditions and elements.
“Bosco Sodi’s work speaks to the material and to the body, to the earth and to the essential thread connecting human beliefs and existence to the world we inhabit,” said curator Schneider Enriquez.
In addition, the world selected for Sodi’s spheres to inhabit is anything but unintentional. Coaxing visitors on a journey through displays of Chinese funerary and Asian Buddhist displays, the globes become points of consolidation for the meditative air of the surrounding objects. Viewers find themselves integrated with both Sodi’s work and the host gallery as they follow an organic path of circumambulation around the indoor spheres. Leaning in to investigate a golden sphere, the visitor finds yet another layer of images on display within the singular object — their own reflection, framed by that of the nearby Buddhist figures. The sphere’s mirroring surface, slightly muddled and cracked, challenges its viewer to reflect while subtly morphing their own appearance.
As the spheres continue from gallery to terrace, the effect of Sodi’s work is amplified by its outdoor lodging: The pieces become topics in the conversation between the Harvard Art Museums’ sleek modern additions by Renzo Piano and the 1927 Fogg Museum’s preserved brick facade. At once fundamental and complex, Sodi’s spheres energize and absorb the surrounding space. The pieces seem as if they had not been installed at all, but were brought to life by the dialogue of the museum architecture.
Sodi’s “Origen” expertly mirrors and grounds its museum context within its gold and terracotta forms, captivating the viewer in its alternating themes of reflection and absorption. Immediately eye-catching with a lingering atmosphere of contemplation, the installation explores the intangible through tangible materials to ground human experience to the source of the natural world. “Origen” can be seen on display at the Harvard Art Museums through June 9, 2024.

Amid Intense Internal Dispute, Harvard Graduate Council Votes to Remove Finance Chair, Alleging Misconduct
Aarya A. Kaushik ’24 can accomplish anything, it seems. A double concentrator in English and Music with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy, Kaushik is a junior in Dunster House who brings a humanist perspective to her work in these “three disparate fields.” Despite her multitude of interests, it’s poetry that Kaushik often chooses to prioritize.
“It was just something that became a part of me, and I was just always doing it,” Kaushik said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Her deep, personal relationship with poetry began to emerge in middle school. Like many young poets, Kaushik started writing for school assignments. Thanks to some encouragement, however, she continued to explore poetry on her own.
“My eighth-grade English teacher, Jim Edgar, was the first person who was like, ‘you can do this, you don't need to just write assignments for class or whatever — this is something you can do by yourself,’” Kaushik said.
That vote of confidence jump-started Kaushik’s journey to discovering her own passion for poetry. “I just started inhaling, breathing poetry of all sorts,” Kaushik said. Diving headfirst into reading poetry helped her foster a deep appreciation of the medium’s intricacies.
“It's an art where the human mind and how it works is really, really clearly present. So, I think that's also why I love it because it's so transparent,” she said.
She also found that poetry helps her understand the world. “The way that I treat poetry is a medium of making sense of the world and of people in my life, of myself,” she said.
In that quest for understanding, Kaushik found herself drawn to metaphysical poets, such as John Donne. “Metaphysical poetry sort of has this element called a conceit to it. I love metaphysical conceits,” she said.
A conceit connects a spiritual aspect of a person with a seemingly unrelated worldly object. This device emerges over and over in Kaushik’s poetry, an homage to the poets that inspired her.
One clear example of Kaushik’s love of the concept comes from her poem “Falling for the Moon.” The poem highlights the frequent presence of the moon with respect to the speaker’s relationship with their mother. The poem concludes with a direct comparison between the two, with Kaushik writing, “Maybe I discovered, in the safety of that cold light, / that she was my moon.”
This deep engagement with the metaphysical poets has certainly shaped her own poetic voice — one she described as “tonally very elegiac.” That quality is reflected in “Stardust,” the collection of poems that she published in 2019. Following nearly 50 attempts to publish the work in magazines, Kaushik ultimately self-published — enabling her authentic, undistilled voice to shine through in her work. Self-publishing her collection ensured a level of cohesion that magazine publication would not.
The process was not easy, though, as she took on all responsibility for assembling her work, including editing and formatting. “It kind of requires you to have a voice outside the valence of your poetic voice because you also have to be your own critic,” she said. Developing that critical voice alongside her poetic one was a major part of her personal growth working on “Stardust.”
Kaushik also reflected on some of her major doubts when publishing her writing: “Something that's very personal to me is now about to be read and shared with many, many people,” she said. “I was very worried, you know, even up to the publication date, of ‘oh my goodness, people reading this are going to learn a lot about me.’”
She decided, however, to go ahead with it. “It's not perfect, but it does hold a sort of special space in my heart as this Herculean endeavor,” she said.
Overcoming this barrier to publication may often dissuade new writers. Talking with other young writers at college, Kaushik said many “feel like maybe this just belongs in my notebook” and so they never publish their work.
“I realized this is almost a symptom of the publication system that so many writers feel this way,” she said. The inaccessibility of many publications was one of the reasons that she published her own collection independently.
Kaushik’s poetry, however, is still mainly an avenue for self-discovery. “The world for poets is full of unknown things that we just can't understand, but the work of a poet is trying to make sense of those things,” she said.
She likened this ordering of the unknown world to the naming of constellations. In “Stardust,” each of its five sections are named after a constellation, an effort from Kaushik to show how her poetry helps her bring a sense of order to the world.
Even after successfully publishing her work, Kaushik went through what she coined “a drought with poetry writing.” This feeling was partially due to comparing poems she wrote after “Stardust” to some of her best works in the collection.
Discussing “The Day the Music Died,” one of her favorite poems in “Stardust,” Kaushik asked herself, “‘Why did I have to write that?’ Because I felt like I could never achieve a poem that was hitting everything that I wanted to in the way that I do in that poem.”
The weight of those expectations helped Kaushik to turn to other means of expression. “I stopped writing poems for a few years, and I was trying out or funneling my love for writing into different fields,” she said.
These new endeavors included composing and songwriting, as well as literary criticism and analysis. Writing for multiple on-campus publications and her classes, Kaushik acknowledged that she produces a wide variety of work.
Gaining a bit of distance from writing poetry allowed Kaushik to develop some advice for her younger self. When asked what advice she would give to young writers, she encouraged aspiring writers to foster “a healthy relationship with your poetry” and to avoid molding themselves “to a standard that you don’t want.”
She also encouraged new writers to find inspiration from other creators. “Influences for your art don’t need to necessarily come from other art in the same genre or even the same form that you write in,” she said.
Kaushik has drawn a wide range of sources for her own poetry. She noted that her dedication to studying jazz music in middle school helped inspire a number of poems in “Stardust,” as she borrowed the collection’s title from her favorite standard.
Kaushik seemed excited to return to her writing and creative expression. “I feel like I've gotten back into a place where I'm filling up notebooks,” she said, “which is such a gratifying feeling for a writer.”
For those looking forward to her next project, she said, “There’s another collection of poems hopefully coming to fruition soon.”

Madras Dosa Co. Brings a Dose of Dosa to Harvard Square
Growing up in a low-income family in rural Missouri, I was not always able to access a wide variety of books on my own. The school I went to was very small, and although the school’s library was wonderful, it did not always have the books I wanted to read. Going to the public library with my parents became a regular activity as my sister and I got to explore options otherwise unavailable to us. My local library became a sanctuary where I could explore the world through books and gain exposure to different perspectives.
In an alarming move, Missouri House Republicans have recently decided to defund public libraries that permit books containing “pornographic or obscene” material — a designation that has increasingly come to covertly signal for LGBTQ+ material. This decision not only challenges the fundamental principles of free speech and intellectual freedom, but also sets a dangerous precedent for the future of diversity and inclusivity in American society. Furthermore, this decision raises significant constitutional concerns. The motives behind this decision, its consequences for the LGBTQ+ community, the wider implications for American society and democracy, and the constitutional principles at stake serve as critical points of discussion in understanding the impact of defunding public libraries that house LGBTQ+ materials.
The recent decision to defund public libraries that house LGBTQ+ materials in Missouri has its roots in a legislative act that criminalizes providing explicit sexual material to a student. The act, as outlined in Section 573.550 of Missouri Senate Bill 775, states that an individual “affiliated with a public or private elementary or secondary school in an official capacity, commits the offense if they knowingly provide, assign, distribute, loan, or coerce acceptance of explicit sexual material to a student.” The act also covers possession with the intent to provide such material to a student. The offense is classified as a Class A misdemeanor.
Literature, like other forms of art, serves as a medium for self-expression and communication of diverse perspectives. Throughout history, various forms of artistic expression have been subject to censorship, often in the name of preserving societal norms or adhering to political ideologies. For instance, during the Cultural Revolution in China, numerous works of art and literature were destroyed or banned as they were considered counter-revolutionary. Similarly, visual art that challenges societal norms, such as the photography of Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano, has faced backlash and calls for censorship.
In particular, Missouri Republicans’ decision to defund public libraries that house LGBTQ+ materials seems to be driven by a combination of factors. The party's conservative base, which is often resistant to changes in societal norms, might perceive LGBTQ+ materials as a threat to traditional family values. Additionally, by taking this controversial stance, Missouri Republicans may be attempting to rally their base and gain political support due to many conservative parents’ opposition to their children’s access to LGBTQ+ materials.
The suppression of art in any form perpetuates discrimination, stifling the voices of marginalized communities and limiting the public’s exposure to perspectives that are different from their own. Missouri’s move to defund these public libraries is part of a broader pattern of accelerating state-level campaigns against libraries over books and materials featuring LGBTQ+ people and themes. This trend highlights increasing efforts by conservative lawmakers to suppress free speech and intellectual freedom, especially with regard to LGBTQ+ materials. With over 100 bills in state legislatures in at least 31 states this year aimed at cutting library budgets, implementing book rating systems, and regulating library collections, the rights of libraries, librarians, and their patrons are under significant attack.
As a staunch believer in the importance of intellectual freedom, I find this stance troubling. Not only has access to LGBTQ+ materials positively impacted me, but I've also witnessed the transformative effect it has had on my friends and acquaintances in helping them better understand themselves and others. One friend, in particular, found solace in a book about gender identity, which ultimately helped them come to terms with their own identity and find the support they needed. As they also grew up in the same rural, conservative community as me, they had very limited access to this information outside of the local library.
Without materials available in libraries, LGBTQ+ individuals in my state may find it more difficult to access information about their identities, mental health, and support networks like my friend did. The decision to defund these libraries also sends a clear message that the LGBTQ+ community is unwelcome, continuing to further stigmatization and isolation. As a result of reduced access to information and increased stigmatization, mental health issues within the LGBTQ+ community could rise.
Furthermore, the decision to defund public libraries that permit LGBTQ+ material sets a dangerous precedent for limiting free speech and intellectual freedom, undermining the very foundation of democratic society. The decision could also pave the way for future attempts to control and censor content that does not align with the views of those in power. Such actions contribute to the systemic erasure of marginalized voices, perpetuating inequity and discrimination.
This Missouri decision also raises significant constitutional concerns, including the violation of freedom of speech. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech, which encompasses the freedom to receive and access information. By defunding public libraries that house LGBTQ+ materials, Missouri Republicans are effectively suppressing speech based on its content, which is a direct violation of First Amendment rights. The right to access information is a fundamental aspect of a democratic society, and the decision to defund libraries that allow LGBTQ+ materials disproportionately affects the LGBTQ+ community, hindering their constitutional right to access information relevant to their sexual orientation and gender identity.
Additionally, the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees equal protection under the law for all citizens. By selectively targeting libraries that house LGBTQ+ materials, Missouri Republicans are discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community, violating their right to equal protection.
While some might argue that the decision does not limit free speech because parents can still choose to buy LGBTQ+ books for their children, this perspective overlooks the classist implications of such a policy. Not all families have the financial means to purchase books, which means that lower-income children would be disproportionately affected by the lack of access to these materials in public libraries. This situation could be seen as a violation of the equal opportunity clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, as it creates an unequal playing field for children from different socioeconomic backgrounds — further perpetuating social inequalities and undermining the principle of equal protection under the law.
Given the constitutional issues at stake, it is likely that the decision to defund public libraries with LGBTQ+ materials will face legal challenges. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) or Lambda Legal could potentially file lawsuits arguing that the decision infringes upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the LGBTQ+ community. If successful, these legal challenges could lead to the reversal of the defunding decision and reaffirm the importance of constitutional protections for marginalized communities.
However, it is important to keep in mind that this proposed budget has only passed the House. Missouri senators, such as Missouri Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Lincoln Hough, claim that they will add the money for the libraries back into the budget.
The decision by Missouri Republicans to defund public libraries that house LGBTQ+ materials represents a concerning development with significant implications for the LGBTQ+ community and the broader principles of American democracy. This situation exemplifies a disturbing trend of state-level campaigns against libraries and the LGBTQ+ materials that they house and distribute. As diverse people and views become increasingly visible in the public sphere, it is essential to uphold values such as inclusivity, free speech, and intellectual freedom. Failure to do so could result in further marginalization and division within communities, ultimately weakening the very fabric of democracy.
Reflecting on my experience growing up in rural Missouri, public libraries played a crucial role in fostering intellectual growth and broadening perspectives. Access to a diverse array of literature at my local library enriched my life and expanded my understanding of the world. By challenging decisions like the one in Missouri and advocating for the constitutional rights of all citizens, including those of the LGBTQ+ community, we can help prevent further attacks on libraries, intellectual freedom, and the rights of marginalized individuals. The fight for a diverse and inclusive society that values the rights and freedoms of every individual must continue, as doing so safeguards the principles that define the nation.

Madras Dosa Co. Brings a Dose of Dosa to Harvard Square
In her newest short story collection, “White Cat, Black Dog,” Kelly Link draws inspiration from a variety of fairy-tales to create a collection of twisting stories that blur the boundaries between reality and fantasy, past and present, ambiguity and clarity. Link’s voice and clear awareness of cultural nuance enables her to do so effectively.
The opening story, “The White Cat’s Divorce,” centers on a rich man living a life of luxury who sends his three sons off to find him a small dog. Unlike “The White Cat,” the original French fairy tale that Link’s story is based on, this quest takes the rich man’s youngest son to a cannabis factory in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado — one that is, of course, run by a talking cat.
“The mechanics of how I can speak are really of no great interest, and I’m afraid that I don’t really understand it myself,” the cat says. In this story and each tale she presents, Link toes the line between immersive, magical world building and honest self-awareness of the ridiculousness of, say, a talking cat.
Link offers an entirely new imagining of this fairytale by taking the thread of the original story and winding it around a radically different place and cast. The original story is recognizable, but it has been repackaged for this day and age. The same can be said of some of the other stories of this collection, while in others the threading is so loose the original story is hardly recognizable.
Take, for example, “Skinder’s Veil,” Link’s take on the Brothers Grimm fairytale “Snow-White and Rose-Red.” In Link’s reimagining, two little girls living in a cabin in the woods are recharacterized as one fourth-year graduate student, Andy Sims, who desperately needs a quiet place to finish his dissertation. A bear still visits, as in the original story, but this time, the bear appears after Andy ingests hallucinogens provided by a visitor to the cabin.
Meanwhile, Link’s reimagining of “The Boy Who Did Not Know Fear,” titled “The Girl Who Did Not Know Fear,” doesn’t include a single male character. Many stories in the collection feature little details like this: things that are just odd enough to stick out and cause a reader to question what they think they may know.
Link effectively transplants stories of European origin to places in the United States and elsewhere. “The Musicians of Bremen” may originally have taken place in Bremen, Germany, but Link’s adaptation, “The White Road,” primarily finds its setting in a post-apocalyptic American South. Arkansas may not be Bremen, but it serves as an effective location for the tale all the same.
For better or for worse, Link has her finger on the cultural pulse. She reflects modern-day society in each story from the awkward (the morning after a one-night stand) to the little discomforts of life (sitting naked upon a rattan chair) to the highest-end luxuries (Balenciaga and green velvet suits).
Link showcases her mastery of narrative with her varying storylines and endings — some a clear happily-ever-after, others left more ambiguous. Link’s blunt, borderline crass tone and straightforward voice become the glue that holds the stories together. One story, “The Game of Smash and Recovery,” contains no true dialogue, only indirect statements. Some of her stories offer a limited first person perspective, while others are narrated by an omniscient third person. Regardless, Link’s humorous, eerie voice remains the same.
The stories show a keen attention to human language, including the spoken “filler” sayings that are often removed in writing (“what I mean to say is” or the interjection of “I believe” in between two statements in a sentence), lending a sense of extreme realism to the fantastical stories. Despite her explicit clarity, Link still manages to harness remarkable powers of description. In one moment, she describes the air quality in hell as “velvety” and “singed.”
Such is the writing of Kelly Link — she paints a portrait close enough to reality to be recognizable, yet not so close as to allow the reader to know what’s truly going on. In these stories, Link offers a portrait of what society looks like today and what it may look like tomorrow. It’s for the reader to determine if these worlds are desirable or not.
