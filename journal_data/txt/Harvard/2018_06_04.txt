Stephanie Garber’s latest novel “Legendary,” the sequel to her well-received debut “Caraval,” continues the story of the two Dragna sisters. Whereas the first book focused on Scarlett, the elder sister, “Legendary” follows Donatella as she tries to win the magical game of Caraval and save her mother. Garber has a knack for describing the unique world she has created, but upon closer look her descriptions border on the nonsensical. Garber takes advantage of the fact that her readers don’t have a complete grasp of the rules of her magical world and, frustratingly, makes the rules up as she sees fit.
At first, Garber’s prose shines.  “Genuine amusement lit a pair of silver-blue eyes, as dazzling as crashing waves, shadowed by untamed hair so gold it could have been turned into coins,” she writes. But the descriptions rarely stray from the handsome men that Donatella comes across or the magnificent dresses she and her sister wear. There are only so many times a reader can handle being told of the way Dante smells “of ink and secrets and wicked magic.” In fact, upon closer investigation, many of these descriptions are pure fluff. What exactly do secrets and wicked magic smell like? Garber has created this magical world, yet she fails to give it the attention it truly deserves. Instead of focusing on the truly unique and interesting setting she has created, Garber continuously repeats details about boys or dresses that hardly even make sense.
This sequel revolves around the Fates, a group of powerful god-like beings who ruled the world many years ago. Some of these Fates, such as the Prince of Hearts, have escaped from the deck of cards they have been trapped in for years. But the Fates are hardly mentioned in the first novel and all the questions about the game of Caraval that were left unanswered remain so in “Legendary” because Garber is too focused on explaining the history and powers of the many different Fates. There are eight Greater Fates, eight Lesser Fates, and a slew of Fated Objects and Fated Places that all require explanations. If Garber had narrowed this list down, she may have been able to successfully streamline the focus more onto the main intrigue of the series: the multi-night game of Caraval.
“Every curse has a way to be broken, and a loophole,” explains Dante. Garber lives by this rule and will shamelessly allow characters who know more than both the main character and the reader, to find and use secret loopholes to save the day. More than once, events happen behind the scenes that magically move the story along. Yet these secret dealings are often left unexplained or quickly glossed over, resulting in a shallow plot. Garber repeatedly takes advantage of the magical world to enable the erasure of certain problems that simply disappear.
The ending is completely unsatisfying. Donatella’s goal is to find her mother and ask her mother questions about her past. However, the novel ends before any of these questions can be addressed and even more questions are introduced in the last 10 pages. It is clear that Garber is leaving her readers in the dark, hoping they will rush to buy her third book in the series, “Finale,” when it comes out next year.
The descriptions quickly lose their luster and expose the skeleton of a plot. Her focus on the dresses and the men is alluring at first but becomes repetitive far too soon. Too many times Garber allows her characters to use loopholes or employ magical skills that were unknown to the reader until that very moment. The focus on the Fates is distracting and brings up more questions rather than answering those that were left after the first book. After all that, it is disappointing to reach the conclusion and fall victim to a clear money grab that leaves readers completely in the dark without the third installment of the series.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lauren Groff’s newest work, a collection of short stories titled “Florida,” is a beautiful yet melancholy meditation on the state of the world. Although fictional, these stories are socially conscious and even the shortest quip has a purpose. Each of Groff’s words feel deliberate, hardening the impact of her stories. Her characters are complex and her writing is lovely, but unfortunately the ending of some of her best stories fall flat: Groff seems to enjoy a vague, mystical ending that doesn’t always harmonize with its story.
Groff knows how to write, and write well. If a woman is heavyset, “Her shirts couldn’t hold in all her flesh.” On a character’s nightly walks, “the neighbors’ lives reveal themselves, the lit windows domestic aquariums.” Groff seems to see the world in intriguing ways, descriptions that make sense once written but feel impossible to think up oneself. It is this unique perspective that allows Groff to turn clichés into beautiful prose: “The sunset is so excessive it fills her with nostalgia.” Her ability to describe the world truthfully does justice to Florida, with its mysterious swamps, suburban areas, and humid climate.
Groff is aware of the America her stories are being read in. Without ever mentioning Trump or any specific legislative action of the past year, it is clear that Groff’s characters experience some anxiety about the state of the world. The main character of the first story, “Ghosts and Empties,” decides not to “barricade [herself] with [her] whiteness in a gated community,” and instead lives in an area that is predominantly black, annoyed with white parents and friends who grimace at the decision. In “Flower Hunters,” the main character speaks kindly of how hard her ex-best friend works: “Meg is the medical director of the abortion clinic in town, and all day she has to hold her patients’ stories and their bodies, as well as the tragic lack of imagination from the chanting protesters on the sidewalk.” “For the God of Love, for the Love of God” explores friendships between people with and without privilege. Characters worry about what the state of the environment will be in their grandchildren’s time. Groff writes of hurricanes and homelessness and motherhood in ways that challenge the reader to think again about these topics.
Perhaps Groff's greatest triumph in this collection is a complex character who is hard to shake long after “Florida” has been finished. An unnamed mother appears in many stories, her most resounding is “The Midnight Zone,” in which she is neither the angelic mother nor the abusive mother. She says, “While it’s true that my children were endlessly fascinating...being a mother never had been, and all that seemed assigned by default of gender I would not do because it felt insulting.” Yet her insistence to refrain from “motherly” duties leaves her husband to do almost all the parenting and all the household chores. On one hand, she can be lauded by feminists for refusing to confine herself to the stereotype women with children are so often forced into, but on the other hand she does so by barely parenting at all. She seems almost incapable of handling them on her own, making “scrambled eggs with a vengeful amount of butter and cheddar...thinking [she] would stupefy [her] children with calories” when she has to watch them without her husband. The mother’s actions and thoughts provoke questions about what it means to be a good mother, the complexity of stereotypes and their repercussions, and other questions of parental responsibility. These questions—which remain unanswered—linger throughout the short stories.
It is when Groff turns to the mystical that her stories suffer. “Eyewall” tells of a woman stuck in a terrible Florida hurricane, and the many people from her past—ex-boyfriends, family—that visit her. Some blow through the door, pushed by the powerful wind. Some ride by in cars only to be blown off the highway. The bizarre nature of the story hinders rather than helps and the strange ways these hallucinations appear distract from the essence of the story. “The Midnight Zone” is flecked with magical realism at its end, implying the fusion of the mother and a panther stalking the woods around their cabin. A few other stories end with a vague, metaphorical ending that lacks a real connection to the body of the work. These endings could be paired with countless other stories and read the same and are the place in which Groff overreaches.
Despite those few stories whose endings flounder in obscurity, Groff has written a collection with beautiful prose. These stories speak for themselves, and some are still yelling out long after “Florida” is put down.
