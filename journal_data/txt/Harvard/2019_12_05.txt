Andrew W. D. Aoyama, FM Chair, 147:
Recently, Andrew reminded me of a story of his that I edited during his freshman year — his first solo-bylined piece, to be exact, of which there would soon be many. I didn’t quite remember it (sorry, Andrew), so I looked back through our emails to find our very first exchange.
Unsurprisingly, it reflects everything that I soon came to find out about Andrew. He was resourceful: A source wasn’t responding to his emails, so he planned to track down the source in person. He was thorough: He sent me his interview questions in advance. He was thoughtful: He mulled over several different possibilities for an angle. And, he was impressive: He sent me a finished draft a full day in advance of our editing session (something that, as you have surely learned as an exec, is precious and very hard to come by).
Andrew, these are qualities that you have demonstrated again and again over the past two years: as a powerhouse staff writer (writing THREE hard-hitting reported stories for our Heat issue glossy last year!), a natural editor (constantly taking on some of our toughest stories), and a dream of a comp director (mentoring a wonderful and strong class of new writers).
And these qualities will certainly serve you so well as chair. I have no doubt that you are going to take our magazine to new heights with your sky high dreams of podcasts and newsletters and monthly glossies. Keep being your resourceful, thorough, thoughtful, and impressive self. FM is so incredibly lucky to have you as a leader next year.

Nina H. Pasquini, FM Chair, 147:
I feel like it’s a safe assumption that Nina H. Pasquini has the capacity for great rage and fury, but one would not know this at first glance. (I only suggest this because I talked to her after she interviewed Harvey Mansfield.) One would, instead, feel intensely supported and heart-warmed in the presence of Nina.
Nina, however, is more than just the calm, warm presence wearing a turtleneck in the newsroom: She is, famously, a party girl (forced by proximity to The Fly Club for Gentlemen); an ardent Timothée Chalamet stan; a wine mom; and a confident, caring reporter.
She is committed to truth in journalism: She asked me to change the text of a levitous piece about The Fly after her deadline because she witnessed, with her own eyes, men playing beer pong in suits and needed to tell the world the truth. She is hardworking in the face of incompetency: She texted me about FM-related matters on Friday and Saturday nights and gracefully weathered my useless responses!
Most importantly, she will lead this magazine with grace, strength, and kindness. Nina, I am confident your chairship will be “very baller, very anarchist,” to quote Timothée Chalamet in “Lady Bird”. I wish you a year of toxic femininity, kickass reporting, and too much fun.

Vivekae M. Kim, FM Editor-at-Large, 147:
By the time you read this parting shot, Vivekae Kim has probably already gone from woman to viral woman. Yeah, that’s right—FM’s next EAL (editor-at-large) is a YouTube sensation known from such videos as “Harvard student goes thrift shopping.” Never heard of it? Well that’s on you.
But I assure you, dear reader, sudden celebrity status will only equip Vivekae for her new job which includes such responsibilities as: setting the tone for answering weekly ice breakers, sending some variation of “hey, this is more of a question for your editor” approximately 65 times per semester, and, most importantly, flashing those pearly whites so the managing editor will proof our articles.
Celeb status aside, there’s no one I’d trust to make the weekly google forms, assign pitches, and reassure the chairs with tepid but still sincere “it’s going to be okay”s. I’ll be reading FM in the dining hall, whispering to myself “Once upon a time I knew her…”
—JED
Congratulations on the beginning of what I am sure will be a thrilling year. I have very few words of caution to offer you, as you are eminently qualified for this position, and I would feel silly giving you instructions. Mostly, what I have to say is this:
I hope you never have a Casual Monday or Tuesday, as I personally have looked forward to playing the “which life-altering outfit will VVK present to us today” game every time I see you, and know all your underlings will, too. I hope you find everything absurd that happens over the course of the next year hilarious. I hope you continue to follow your gut when it comes to stories you feel must be written. You have an unusually sound moral compass that I admire very much, and I cannot wait to see where it leads you.
Please remind AWDA and NHP that everything is going to be okay and that nothing matters as much as they think it does. But also I hope you can also validate their anxieties and cry along with them when things go wrong. It is fun to care about things when you are a college student and nothing really matters. I hope you always care a lot.
Mostly, I hope you have as much fun as JED and I have this past year! I have the highest of hopes for you next year.

146th Guard:
Norah M. Murphy, FM Chair, 146:
Once I told Norah that I was having a bad week and wanted to quarantine myself in my room with some Ben and Jerry’s and a rom-com. Norah’s eyes widened because Norah loves rom-coms, and she offered to give me tailored advice. I said that I preferred mild cynicism in my rom-coms, and Norah recommended “Obvious Child,” which did in fact feature a perfect bouquet of dry wit and Jenny Slate. But what elevates this story to Norah-status is what happened next: I logged onto Twitter and saw that after our conversation, Norah had made a Google form called “romcom matchatron 2000” so that she could spread her services to the public.
Norah: You have gifted FM with your leadership, patience, humor, and grace under pressure for many years, and now we must give you up so that you can matchmake rom-coms for the rest of the world. I don’t know what I will do without you — when, during magazine initiations, you are not in the room to share the weight of being made fun of for having a tendency to rewatch “Pride and Prejudice” during times of stress. You were the first leader on FM who made this place feel like home for me. You are always there for us, literally, sometimes you are one of two attendants at comp socials. You are kind and grounded, honest and down-to-earth, and you never get mad at people, even when they don’t know how to use InDesign after one (1) year.
Please never stop Tweeting, so that there is always something to fill the statement-Doc-Marten-shaped holes in our hearts.

Abigail L. Simon, FM Chair, 146:
“You’re really lucky to have Abigail as an editor,” she says, perched on the edge of the couch. She was right — I was extremely lucky, and so was the rest of FM.
It’s Harvard-Yale weekend, and one of my best friends from high school and I are paying a visit to one of his college best friends — who, coincidentally, was one of Abigail’s high school best friends. If that was a confusing sentence to read, don’t worry: The chain of events to which it refers was equally confusing.
But by the time we arrived at Abigail’s suite in Pfoho, she had already gone to bed, leaving just the three of us to collect in her common room.
“Abigail was the best of us,” her friend continues. “Sharp, smart, funny — but more than anything, kind. The magazine is in amazing hands with her as chair”
She was right about this too: Abigail is the best of us.
Abigail: You have carried FM with grace, modeled for us what it means to lead with generosity, creativity, and care. We’ve been lucky to have you as an editor — and luckier still to have you as a friend, a mentor, and a role model.
—AWDA
Jensen E. Davis, FM Editor-at-Large, 146:
My favorite pose is your T-pose. It’s not most people’s kind of T-pose, when people are trying to assert dominance. Instead, it’s a fantastic flourish of Jensen-trademarked conviction and/or exasperation of the best kind, often accompanied by a remarkably hilarious quip worthy of Twitter-viral fame. I love our shared interest in celebrity, your large scarves, and your platform boots made for a reformed (?) party girl. I shall miss your pithy remarks in both writer’s and exec, usually punctuated by a single arm raised, pointer finger directed at the heavens. Thank you for being YOU. You are simultaneously the most and the least LA person I have ever met and I’m not sure what we’ll do at FM without your West Coast representation. I’m thankful that we’ll at least have your incisive Twitter coffee shop commentary.
—VMK
Eliya O. Smith, FM Editor-at-Large, 146:
One thing I have always appreciated about you is that we always seem to be on the same page about our preferred level of petulance -- that is, a VERY HIGH LEVEL. (I will advocate for petulant interviews in exec.) In your footsteps, I hope to strut, in flowing robes, with unparalleled confidence and irreverent wit through the newsroom. I’m actually not sure how I will cope without your white crayon ice breaker answer, our anticipatory laughter that begins bubbling up during your exposition, and your assumption of a very Eliya story-telling pose -- chin up, authoritative, clear-eyed gaze trained on a distant Sanctum corner. I hope my comedic timing will someday match up. Finally, I shall always remember how your editing always helped me believe in myself -- like I did have the power to seek and show truth through my reporting and writing. EOS, I will miss you!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Surrounded by a crowd of United States Representatives and reporters, Harvard Law School Professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 testified in the first House Judiciary Committee hearing into the Trump impeachment inquiry on Wednesday.
The hearing, which featured several law professors’ testimony on the constitutional landscape of impeachment, followed the first round of hearings regarding President Donald Trump held by the House Intelligence Committee.
After a months-long investigation, the Intelligence Committee produced a report Tuesday charging Trump of soliciting the Ukrainian government’s aid in the 2020 presidential election and attempting to obstruct the congressional investigation into his connections with Ukraine.
In his testimony, Feldman said Trump abused his office through corrupt solicitation of Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rivals, including during the 2020 presidential election.
“On the basis of the testimony and the evidence before the House, President Trump has committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors by corruptly abusing the office of the presidency,” Feldman said.
He said the words abuse of power are neither “mystical” nor “magical” and are applicable to Trump’s actions with Ukraine.
“The abuse of office occurs when the President uses a feature of his power, the awesome power of his office, not to serve the interests of the Americna public but to serve his personal, individual, partisan, electoral interests,” Feldman said. “That is what the evidence before the House indicates.”
Alongside Feldman, law school professors Pamela S. Karlan, Michael J. Gerhardt, and Jonathan Turley also served as witnesses in the inquiry. The four professors discussed the constitutional history of impeachment and opined on whether Trump’s communications with Ukraine warranted impeachment.
The three scholars invited by Democrats — including Feldman — testified that Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukraine was an impeachable offense. The fourth professor, who was invited by Republicans, said there was not sufficient evidence for impeachment.
Feldman began his opening statement citing his role at Harvard, which includes teaching a course about the U.S. Constitution from its origins to the present.
He said the Constitution’s framers included impeachment out of fear that the President of the United States might abuse the power of the office to attempt to corrupt the electoral process and ensure reelection or to subvert national security.
When addressing the Judiciary Committee, he said that Congress has the sole power of impeachment.
“Let me be clear,” Feldman said. “It is not my responsibility or my job to determine the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before the House thus far. That is your constitutional responsibility.”
Feldman said the provision for impeachment was included for instances such as the one before the House.
“The framers were not prophets, but they were very smart people with a very sophisticated understanding of human incentives,” Feldman said. “They understood that a president would be motivated naturally to try to use the tremendous power of office to gain personal advantage, to keep himself in office, corrupt the electoral process, and to potentially subvert the national interest.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge residents will cast ballots this week as part of the city’s participatory budgeting process, selecting their top five choices among 20 total resident-submitted proposals, in order to decide how to spend $1 million of the city’s budget next year.
The budgeting process involves soliciting proposals from the general public on ways to improve public spaces. The city will set aside more money of its 2021 fiscal year budget compared to recent years to fund and implement the winning proposals. Last year, the city allocated $925,000 to participatory budgeting.
The budget for fiscal year 2020 totaled more than $678 million, a 5.7 percent increase from the previous year.
Voting began Dec. 1 and continues through the end of this week. All Cambridge residents age 12 and over, regardless of citizenship status, are eligible to vote, as well as any university students living in the city. This year marks the sixth cycle of the city’s participation in participatory budgeting.
The city received more than 1,600 proposals from residents in this year’s cycle, according to Matt Nelson, the participatory budgeting coordinator for the city’s budget office.
“This is a way to really bring in residents, not just by sending folks their tax bills and the annual budget process, but also bringing in residents more deeply,” he said. “I think this year we've got a great group of projects on the ballot.”
After receiving the list of initial proposals submitted over the summer, participatory budgeting delegates spent several months reviewing proposals, according to Nelson. When necessary, some proposals were combined or rejected if they did not meet certain criteria. These delegates, in conjunction with other city staff, provide a shortlist of “viable and feasible” projects to be included on the ballot, per Nelson.
The 20 final proposals on the ballot would funnel money toward proposals ranging from environmental preservation efforts to traffic-related improvements to the construction of new public amenities.
There are two bicycle-related proposals this year — one which aims to increase the availability of bike parking and one that would install more Bluebike stations near affordable housing. One proposal suggests putting in public WiFi throughout Cambridge, while another proposal advocates installing more benches across the city.
Environmental proposals include expanding the city’s tree canopy and replacing open trash bins with Big Belly Solar Compactors. One project, Make the City Bloom with a Habitat Corridor, suggests planting “native flowers and vegetation” along a strip that connects Fresh Pond and Mt. Auburn Cemetery — an area that is “crucial” to the city’s biodiversity, according to the project description.
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale wrote in a statement that the goal of participatory budgeting is to promote “engagement” among Cambridge residents.
“I have always looked for ways to connect the community with city finances, and Participatory Budgeting has been a great tool for achieving this goal,” he wrote. “I am proud that through the first five cycles Participatory Budgeting, we have funded over $3.6 million in 33 capital projects – all of which were submitted, developed and voted on by the Cambridge community.”
This year’s $1 million allocation stands as the highest capital commitment to the project so far. Past winning projects include solar panel installations at a public library, bike repair stations, and public restrooms.
Rochelle G. Ruthchild, a member of the 888 Women’s History Project, contributed to a proposal to build a public art installation in commemoration of the black, feminist, and LGBTQ activists who occupied 888 Memorial Drive in 1971.
“The women’s movement in general, it is the least documented, of any of the great social movements of the 20th and 21st century, so to do a public art installation that both honors the community activists of Riverside, and the women who took over the Memorial Drive building goes some way towards increasing the visibility,” Ruthchild said.
Lifelong Cambridge resident, Amanda Peters, said that the participatory budgeting process is an important tool of democratic governance.
“I think it's a fantastic opportunity for residents to be able to have some say in how their money is spent,” Peters said. “To have a portion of the money that can go to projects that might seem like side projects, but in fact are really important for the life and the livability of the city. . .it's really great to have those ideas come directly from residents.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly a quarter of surveyed doctoral students across the University are at risk for moderate to severe depression and anxiety, two Harvard College Institutional Research representatives reported at the Graduate Student Council’s meeting Wednesday.
The results come from the HCIR Graduate Student Mental Health Surveys project, spearheaded by former head of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira. The project works with Ph.D. students across the University to develop department-specific surveys. Upon completion and analysis, the surveys provide students with personal risk factors for different mental illnesses and evaluate departments’ support for mental health issues.
Since 2017, the University has administered 42 unique surveys. Eleven of the surveys contain directly comparable data and average a response rate of 54.4 percent.
The survey results revealed that across the 11 surveys, on average, 60.4 percent of students score positive for Imposter Phenomenon; 54.9 percent for loneliness; 23.6 percent for depression, 23.1 percent for anxiety; 11.1 percent for suicidal thoughts; 3.7 percent for suicidal plans; and 0.4 percent for suicide attempts.
Regarding departmental culture, on average, 44.8 percent of students reported “knowing where to turn” for “advisor issues,” 50.5 percent “feel comfortable sharing personal concerns with a faculty member,” and 76.3 percent feel their department faculty are “moderately or very much” invested in the success of their research.
HCIR representatives Karen Pearce and Christine Huang presented the data from the surveys at Wednesday night’s GSAS Student Council’s open meeting.
Pearce highlighted the proactive role students have played in facilitating the surveys.
“There’s no other research like this right now,” Pearce said. “We need students to play their part. We need you to mobilize your departments, to come to us and ask for us to do this. We want to do this for you.”
Student proactivity is especially important in departments that may resist administering the surveys, according to Pearce.
“There have been some departments that have been less than open to all of this,” Pearce said. “We’ve been able to run it in every department where graduate students came forward and asked to do it, but there have been some departments that have caused some problems — the faculty have not wanted it to happen.”
The GSC announced at the end of the presentation that the executive board is applying to the Presidential Innovation Fund to create a $25,000 “Mental Health Award” to be regularly given to the GSAS department which best addresses mental health issues.
GSC President Zachary M. Hayworth said in an interview that the GSC is currently in conversations with GSAS administrators and HCIR to determine more “concrete” ways to address mental health issues.
“It’s a call to action,” Hayworth said. “It shows us why we exist as an advocacy body. We’re all hands on deck for partnering with the administration for finding and implementing solutions.”
Wednesday’s meeting also saw GSAS Athletics Fellow W. Éamon Callison call on graduate students to email Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay to ask that the administration guarantee the continued existence of GSAS intramural sports following the completion of the Dudley House Transition.
Recent years have seen GSAS students compete under the banner of Dudley House in the College intramural sports league. Dudley House will officially transition to the GSAS Student Center during the 2020-2021 academic year, leaving GSAS students without an athletic league of any form.
GSAS Athletic Fellows are working with College, University, and GSAS administrators to formulate a solution. One option on the table is creating an independent GSAS intramural league.
“We’re trying to come up with a plan that will give us our own independent IM league within GSAS, or possibly open it up to other schools beyond GSAS,” Callison said.
Callison said that administrators have “a fair amount of concern” that losing athletic facility access and competitive teams may lead to negative mental health effects as well.
“This is important. Being physically active impacts your mental health. There’s a fair amount of concern on behalf of the deans with us no longer having access to sports,” Callison said. “We want to make sure going forward that we still have access to gyms and courts and we aren’t pushed out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s late game comeback against Northeastern (2-6) fell short in Wednesday’s game, which ended in a 46-44 victory for the Huskies, who trailed by double figures in the first frame.
The game, which saw five lead changes, was fast-paced. At times, the movement on the court was chaotic, in parallel with the energy throughout Lavietes Pavilion, which brimmed with about 1,200 local children who came to watch Harvard for Education Day. Both teams committed at least 20 turnovers each.
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said the speed of the game hurt the Crimson (6-3), which was vying for its fourth consecutive win on Wednesday morning.
“Young teams who are still trying to connect have a tendency to rush,” she said. “As soon as [opponents] turn the heat up, our answer is to rush some more, when in fact [we] should do the opposite.”
Freshman guard Lola Mullaney said that she and her teammates need to do a better job of combatting opponents’ pressure and setting their own pace.
“Teams tend to speed us up,” she said. "We're really working on creating the tempo from our perspective and not letting them rush us.”
Undeniably, Wednesday’s game solidified Mullaney’s role as the offensive lifeblood of the Crimson team. The two-time Ivy League Rookie of the Week, who finished the game with 17 points, spent its first three quarters struggling to get into a groove, hitting 1 of 8 three pointers.
Mullaney found her rhythm in the fourth quarter, shooting three for five from downtown to lead the Crimson’s attempt to come back from an 8 point deficit to start the final period. With just under three minutes remaining in the game, Mullaney scored 8 consecutive points — via back-to-back triples and a breakaway layup—to erase Harvard’s deficit and put her team up by two points, 44-42.
Northeastern answered Mullaney’s shooting with a three of its own from No. 11 guard Stella Clark to snatch the lead from Harvard. That three proved to be the final basket of the ball game, as Harvard was unable to connect on its next two offensive possessions and on the defensive end failed to foul the Huskies before the clock ran out.
Despite Mullaney’s lull, the Crimson initially found success on offense, though it was unsustainable. Sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy and junior forward Rachel Levy fueled the Crimson’s dominant first quarter, which ended with Harvard ahead 16-8.
McCarthy scored the team’s first five points, finishing a reverse layup off an offensive rebound to score the first field goal for both teams and then adding a three from the top of the key.
Levy, who came off of the bench, scored 8 points in her first four minutes on the court. The versatile scorer laid in a bucket over two smaller Northeastern opponents and then sank two three pointers from the corner and top of the key.
In the second quarter, the Huskies tripled its score. The team went on a 12-0 run to ultimately outscore the Crimson 15-7.
Senior forward Jeannie Boehm, generally a steady contributor to Harvard’s offense, failed to score in her 35 minutes on the court, only attempting to score four times. Though she was silent as a scorer, Boehm did assert herself as a rebounder, pulling in 12 rebounds.
Despite Boehm’s strong rebounding, Delaney-Smith was not satisfied with her team’s performance in this area. Harvard allowed Northeastern to grab 14 offensive rebounds, which Delaney-Smith said “caused a lot of problems point-wise but also foul-wise.”
Over a month away from Ivy League play, Delaney-Smith hopes to turn each loss into a learning opportunity, and Wednesday’s game was no different.
“The educator in me says, you gotta lose it to learn from it,” she said. “We have a lot to learn.”
The Crimson will play at Maine on Saturday in its final non-conference away game. Tip-off is slated for 1 p.m.
