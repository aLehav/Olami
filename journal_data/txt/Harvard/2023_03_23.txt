Hannah F. Whitten is making a name for herself in the world of fantasy literature. Whitten is a Nashville-based author who recently released her third novel — and the first in her upcoming “Nightshade Crown” trilogy — “The Foxglove King,” an enthralling fantasy that follows Lore, a witty and enjoyable 23-year-old spy imbued with death magic, as she tries to infiltrate the royal court of the fantastical city Dellaire and solve a mystery.
Growing up in Huntsville, Alabama, and later Nashville, Tennessee, Whitten was surrounded by the influence of evangelical Christianity, which often makes its way into her writing. These religious influences can be seen throughout all three of her novels.
“Growing up in the Bible belt and around evangelical Christianity made me very much want to write things kind of deconstructing that,” Whitten said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “Dealing with my own trauma and hang-ups in those areas just because it’s so baked into the culture around here. You can’t really get away from it.”
Whitten’s writing is also inspired by the natural world, as she is an avid hiker and camper, spending much of her free time exploring the outdoors. She often incorporates plant imagery into her writing, and her descriptions of forests, mountains, and rivers are vivid and immersive, transporting readers to the heart of the wilderness.
For Whitten, writing has always been a form of self-expression and a way to explore the world around her. She began writing stories as a child and continued to do so throughout her teenage years and into adulthood, but it wasn't until after she had her daughter that she began to take writing seriously as a potential career.
“I really started writing it because I needed something that was just for me, that was not taking care of my kid or my house or my family. Something that was just mine,” she said.
“For the Wolf,” Whitten’s debut novel, was originally intended as a young adult passion project she described as “self-indulgent.” But after signing with an agent and going through the publishing process — during which the manuscript was revised from YA to adult fiction — Whitten realized that she could turn her passion for writing into a full-time job.
Whitten’s process for creating the immersive worlds of her stories is a long one. She spends a great deal of time working to convey the images and ideas in her head in the first draft of a novel and then revises extensively to make the picture as clear as possible. She also emphasizes the importance of using all of the senses to create a richly detailed experience for the reader.
“I am very much one of those writers where there is a movie playing in my head, and I am just trying to describe it,” Whitten said.
Rather than having only surface-level strength, Whitten’s characters are three-dimensional, flawed, and relatable. She believes that there is a big difference between a strong character in a book and a strong character in writing. By writing, she was referencing the actual depth of a character.
“[Writing strong characters] means leaning into them and what makes them flawed and unlikable just as much as the things that are going to make readers root for them,” Whitten said. “I really think that making someone who reacts realistically to what’s around them is what makes a strong character.”
Whitten’s inspiration for these characters can come from unexpected places. Lore’s character in “The Foxglove King” was inspired in part by her frustration with the “Rey Palpatine” twist in the movie “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” — the reveal that the protagonist, Rey, is the granddaughter of the evil Emperor Palpatine.
“[Rey Palpatine] could have been a really cool and impactful twist, kind of been something that was telegraphed from the beginning, and, you know, actually planned out and developed,” Whitten said. “It could’ve worked as a middle installment of a trilogy, but it doesn’t work as an end installment.”
The movie got Whitten thinking about writing a trilogy where a momentous reveal about the main character’s backstory as the heir to a dark legacy occurred in the middle installment.
For Whitten, the most rewarding aspect of writing as a career is sharing her stories with the world — connecting with a community of readers who can find solace in escaping to her fantastical worlds. When asked what message she would like readers to take away from “The Foxglove King,” she said, “Where you come from doesn’t dictate where you are going, even whenever it feels inescapable.”
Looking ahead, Whitten is excited to continue exploring the in-between spaces of YA and adult fiction and the realms of fantasy and romance.
“I would like to explore writing older characters, actually,” Whitten said. “I’m 31 and would like to, with my next few books, write characters who are my own age.”
Her next two projects will be the final two installments in the “Nightshade Crown” trilogy, the second of which will be coming out next spring.

The Trader Joe’s on Memorial Drive in Cambridge embodies the grocer’s reputation as a community-centered store that offers hip, healthy food at affordable prices. A vibrant mural stretches across the squat stucco building’s riverfront facade, depicting smiling members of the Cambridge community sharing meals together. Inside, the bustling store truly feels like a trading post. Friendly crew members and regular shoppers create a welcoming environment that invites newcomers to join the search for delicious and affordable finds, like speculoos cookie butter or the plant-based tikki masala. The Trader Joe’s appears embedded in local history, and it continues to play an active role in the community today.
The Trader Joe’s across the river in Allston seems to tell another story. Steel-paned floor-to-ceiling windows dominate the large storefront. A sleek new apartment building rises several stories above, and the Harvard Science and Engineering Complex looms down the road. These aggressively modern structures are conspicuous amidst the older, more charming brick buildings in the surrounding neighborhood. It’s hard to believe that a Trader Joe’s occupies this lot: A tech startup or an upscale grocer selling twenty-dollar kombucha seems more likely. In the store, the grocer’s characteristic hand-written labels and casually arranged displays feel out of place among the industrial lighting and sharp modern design.
At first glance, this tale of two Trader Joe’s appears to follow the familiar story of a company that compromised its foundational values as it achieved success. The older Cambridge location represents the company’s economical, community-based ethos, while the newly-constructed Allston store demonstrates — like the big supermarkets it originally sought to oppose — that Trader Joe’s has become an intrusive presence. While this evolution appears to violate the core values of the brand, this narrative ignores founder Joe Coulombe’s shrewd entrepreneurial spirit that has remained the driving force of the company’s operations. New Trader Joe’s stores are in line with Coulombe’s resourceful tactics that helped the company beat competitors and grow to a national scale. Although this business acumen inspired Trader Joe’s egalitarian image, it also limited the brand’s accessibility by catering to a specific demographic of middle-class, college-educated consumers. As Trader Joe’s continues to grow as one of the nation’s most popular grocery stores, it must reconcile these competing values to uphold its mission of making affordable, high-quality food accessible to all.
Joe Coulombe started Trader Joe’s in 1967 as a grocer that offered affordable products not found in traditional convenience and grocery stores. For several years, he ran a chain of convenience stores in Southern California. Coulombe saw the value of filling product gaps and dealing directly with the supplier. He applied these lessons to Trader Joe’s, selling health-oriented and imported food not offered by competitors. This approach eliminated intermediaries, allowing Trader Joe’s to buy directly from suppliers and sell items at discounted rates.
Trader Joe’s unique product offerings are both a core staple of their brand as well as a large reason for its enduring popularity. The company has built a unique and diverse selection of tasty and healthy items that keep customers coming back at one of the highest rates in the industry. Shoppers would be hard-pressed to find items like black tea boba coconut ice cream and Everything But the Bagel seasoning anywhere else. To keep shoppers curious and engaged, the grocer continuously adds new products while removing less-successful ones, according to their company website.
Customers respond positively to these efforts, and social media accounts and blogs with millions of followers have helped establish a community of Trader Joe’s regulars who bond over the store’s treasure trove of unexpected finds. A welcoming employee base, dressed in distinctive Hawaiian shirts and leis, further fosters an inviting, casual shopping environment with friendly service, hand-written signage, and recommendations galore.
The brand’s private label allows it to accomplish all this at reasonable prices. Today, 80% of Trader Joe’s items are sold under the brand name. Standardizing these cheaper rates across all the brand’s numerous locations further guarantees accessible prices for customers across the nation. A Consumers’ Checkbook survey found that products at Trader Joe’s were on average 18% cheaper than the industry average, while 76% of customers believed the store was of “superior” quality.
In addition to a unique selection of affordable offerings, a defining characteristic of Trader Joe’s has been its clear focus on serving an educated, middle-class demographic. When describing the target consumer he had in mind when starting Trader Joe’s, Coulombe would often use the phrase “overeducated and underpaid.” He envisioned a store that catered to university graduates who had adventurous, health-oriented palates but couldn’t afford gourmet meals on a middle-class budget. Coulombe and his successors in Trader Joe’s leadership crafted an economical assortment of healthy food items to fit the bill. Instead of adopting a full-service supermarket approach that would require a comprehensive set of groceries and necessities, Trader Joe’s features a narrow yet carefully curated product range to match the target consumer’s taste, a remarkably successful strategy.
Though good for business, this narrow focus has challenged Trader Joe’s commitment to accessibility and even made it a symbol of gentrification in lower-income communities. A list of store locations indicates that Trader Joe’s tend to pop up in wealthier parts of urban centers. There’s a glaring lack of stores in more rural parts of the Midwest, where access to cheap, healthy food is especially needed. Even in urban areas, less affluent residents choose other stores over Trader Joe’s, as it doesn’t offer a comprehensive set of necessities like other grocers. As a result of its close association with upper-middle-class consumers, many lower-income communities of color view Trader Joe’s as a force of gentrification. For example, the Portland African American Leadership Forum opposed the opening of a Trader Joe’s in a historically diverse and low-income neighborhood in 2016. Trader Joe’s ultimately abandoned construction.
These concerns are not unwarranted, either. A study by Zillow found that the arrival of a Trader Joe’s caused neighborhood rent and property values to increase 4.5% faster than the city average. Another investigation by RCLCO consulting group reported that construction of a Trader Joe’s in an apartment complex raised rent by an average of 5.8%.
The niche, distinctive products that make Trader Joe’s so beloved by many are also the reason why it has become a symbol of class privilege and gentrification for lower-income communities. Still, the grocer has undeniably succeeded in offering unique, healthier alternatives to traditional groceries. Expanding its target consumer base may allow Trader Joe’s to be more inclusive in its offerings and store locations. Reframing the business strategy that has guided the company since its founding will hopefully bring Trader Joe’s closer to achieving its goal of making healthy, delicious food accessible for all.

Showtime’s “George & Tammy” is one of the many biopics currently flooding the television landscape — but it might be the best one yet. Amongst the flurry, “George & Tammy” holds its own. Beautifully paying tribute to country legends George Jones and Tammy Wynette, the limited series shines in its portrayal of human relationships, love, and tragedy with perfect vulnerability and nuance.
“George & Tammy” was written by screenwriter Abe Sylvia. The show began as a film screenplay based on the memoir “The Three of Us: Growing Up with Tammy and George,” written by Jones and Wynette’s daughter, Georgette Jones. Sylvia eventually realized the material would flourish more in a television format, as it would allow him to further delve into the complicated relationships and career developments without time constraints. In cooperation with Georgette Jones, he set out to tell the story of Jones and Wynette as people and parents and not just as country music superstars.
Georgette Jones has applauded the show for its ability to highlight her parents’ humanity beyond their artistry and creativity. The limited series format impactfully tells the story of Jones and Wynette’s career and relationship from beginning to end, highlighting both the wonderful and destructive aspects of their love and fame. As their life story unravels from their first to last meeting, every scene is heartbreakingly underscored by their own country music, perfectly shaping the narrative of their story.
The life story of Jones and Wynette is told with empathy, detail, and grace in six episodes, allowing viewers to develop a nuanced understanding of their tumultuous life while connecting with them on a deep emotional level.
Here and there, the show slightly loses structure, delving into Jones’s (Michael Shannon) background increasingly more than Wynette’s (Jessica Chastain). The miniseries also occasionally misses the opportunity to further investigate the effects of alcoholism and abuse on a partner as opposed to highlighting the violent outbursts themselves. However, “George and Tammy” does admittedly raise awareness regarding said serious issues overall.
The cinematography beautifully merges with the music arrangements in each episode, which clearly reflect on the evolving life story of the characters. A scene in which Wynette relapses is accompanied by the song “Help Me Make It Through The Night,” an on-the-nose but emotionally resonant musical choice. The directing shows contrasting themes of desperation and relief, making it one of the most painful and tragic scenes to watch on television to date. Director John Hillcoat rarely misses, yet at times the show gets dangerously close to leaning too much into the melodramatic side of musical theater. However, even these dramatic moments are underscored by a level of honesty and vulnerability that leaves the audience in awe.
The biggest asset of this Showtime special without a doubt lies in the immeasurable talent of both Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain, the latter of which won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries for her portrayal of Wynette this year. The emotional depth, vulnerability, and commitment that Chastain and Shannon bring to their roles as Wynette and Jones radiate from the screen. Their chemistry is electric and makes the show easy to fall into. The many years both actors reportedly spent researching and preparing for their role has paid off: Watching Shannon and Chastain navigate the challenging life of Jones and Wynette is a true masterclass in character acting. Worth noting is also Steve Zahn’s portrayal of Wynnette’s later husband George Richy. His characterization of the record producer and songwriter makes Richy the most disturbing villain in the show. Witnessing his progression from friend to enemy is devastatingly painful, and never fails to disturb the audience by challenging the limits of human decency.
The acting performances are only enriched by emotionally fueled renditions of the music that brought both Jones and Wynette country music fame performed by Chastain and Shannon. The two actors recorded their own vocals for the show and performed them live on set. Both actors worked extensively with Nashville vocal coach Ron Browning to successfully tackle the music, and their efforts paid off. Their versions of the classic country songs certainly bear a striking resemblance to the originals, ensuringtheir version supports the emotional journey of their characters. The connection between Wynette and Jones, as well as between the actors, is tangible when they look into each other’s eyes and sing.
“George & Tammy” is an incredibly vulnerable portrayal of two complicated, but immensely talented people. The cinematography, musicality, and, most importantly, the acting performances in the show make it a must-watch, whether one is familiar with George Jones and Tammy Wynette or not. Showtime’s miniseries is both the perfect introduction to the country music legends and the perfect love letter to George Jones and Tammy Wynette’s life work.

Composed with alluring lyrics and a sound that transcends genres, Kali Uchis is back, with her third full-length album “Red Moon In Venus.” This long-anticipated album is a treat for her fans as it maintains similar musical motifs as her last album, 2020’s “Sin Miedo,” while also exploring novel sounds. The vulnerability on display throughout this album is impressive and unexpected, as Uchis points directly to her fans, haters, past lovers, and even her current boyfriend, Houston rapper Don Toliver. This intimate collection of tracks has the power to draw in anyone with an appreciation for chill, meditative energy, and music that mimics an almost fairy-tale-like daze. Kali Uchis creates a peaceful, happy place to welcome listeners into. Her smooth manipulation of flower imagery and astrology references sets the stage for a euphoric listening experience.
The album’s first single, “I Wish You Roses,” perfectly works in tandem with the album opener “In My Garden.” Filled with the sounds of birds and nature, “In My Garden,” creates the serene setting present across the album, as Uchis whispers “I love you,” preparing listeners for the spiritual journey that awaits. Immediately entering into the next song, the journey begins with the repeated chorus “I wish you love, I wish you well, I wish you roses.” Contrasting the petals and thorns of a rose, Uchis’ album showcases the passionate duality as intense feelings interchange with softness, and emotions rising and falling like the ocean.
This cyclical and heartfelt experience is further shown through the astrological themes of the album’s title and its second single “Moonlight.” The rarity and show-stopping effect of a red moon expresses the power and importance of the once in a lifetime, authentic love she writes about, while also referencing femininity, desire, and emotion. This effect is also created through the reference to Venus, the roman goddess associated with romance and harmony, love and beauty. Layering harmonies in the song “Love Between,” she designs these themes in the orchestration as she beautifully and simply repeats “love between two human beings can be so wonderful.”
The musical compositions behind the lyrics seem to connect to each other in ways that help tie them to her different eras. In the songs “Como Te Quiero Yo” and “Hasta Cuando,” a similar sound that was found in “Sin Miedo,” can be heard.Thus, Uchis pays homage to the sound and themes of her second album, which was sung almost entirely in Spanish and was heavily influenced by Latin music. It's a heartwarming nod, as the Columbian-American singer fought to have this album in Spanish, despite being told it wouldn’t be successful. Ultimately proving the critics wrong, “Sin Miedo,” contains some of her biggest hits like “Telepatia,” and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Música Urbana Album. On Red Moon In Venus, Uchis continues to prove herself as an artist whose music is blooming alongside her, while maintaining confidence in her style,and defining her own sound more and more every album.
Uchis also does a skillful job incorporating other artists on features throughout the album. On “Red Moon In Venus,” she collaborates with Omar Apollo, Don Toliver, and Summer Walker. Each feature branches away from the general sound of the album to compliment the genre and style of the artist featured. Omar Apollo’s catchy and funky sound makes for a perfect addition on “Worth the Wait,” as he and Uchis play off of each other’s verses, making it a fun and stunning piece. Both Don Toliver and Summer Walker’s features on “Fantasy” and “Deserve Me,” respectively, enhance the album with distinct themes of R&B that expand the breadth of Uchis’ reach rather than distract from it.
Briefly disrupting the album, “Not Too Late (interlude),” signals the journey is sadly coming to an end. Uchis teases “It’s not too late to admit you love me,” before continuing into the last few songs of the album. The last track “Happy Now,” feels like a celebratory, bittersweet finale. Uchis poses the question “Can we be happy now?” over an upbeat sound, tying together the motifs of the album with references to the stars aligning and having perfect timing in a relationship. Suddenly, the music changes, to a gentle riff, with the ocean in the background. Peacefully transporting listeners out of the world of the album, Kali Uchis shows just how dimensional her music is. She emphasizes the importance of “peace of mind,” and gives an angelic warning: “Don’t speed through the rainbows.” This time-stopping piece is a must-listen, promoting self-reflection, healing, and mental wellbeing. As she speaks her final sentiments about remembering “All the good things,” the world is slowly put back into orbit, leaving the listener with the tranquil sound of waves and an urge to press replay.

“True Lies” is an entertaining yet easily predictable late-night watch that fails to keep up with the original. The CBS original show, based on James Cameron’s spy action comedy film of the same name, premiered on Mar. 1.
The “True Lies” remake is created by Matt Nix and revolves around the same premise as the original film, featuring Steve Howkey and Ginger Gonzaga as the unusual couple bound to save their marriage — and the world. The storyline itself is too predictable and cliche. The wife who spends her days at yoga class and complains about her husband's boring behavior. Confiding in her friend, she addresses the late nights her husband spends at work and naturally comes to the conclusion that her husband must be having an affair. In fact, at times the CBS show even borders on parody: The first episode alone features a lipstick weapon, a lingerie dance session, and an action-packed helicopter escape. This is exacerbated by the blatantly stereotypical portrayal of gender roles: Though the show does make some attempts to challenge these gendered stereotypes, they are rather fruitless given the inherent sexism within the storyline itself.
Granted, the mere premise of the show is still guaranteed to provide a decent level of entertainment, even if this kind of entertainment is not grounded in social importance. The show proves to be a fun, if superficial viewing experience. “True Lies” is the kind of show that works as long as viewers do not think and simply watch.
In addition to the lack of innovation in the story, the cinematography leaves room for improvement. Many of the camera angles, frames, and transitions appear to have been taken straight out of a reality TV show. Bizarre production choices such as the Parisian backdrop also begs questions along the lines of: Who knew that there were palm trees in Paris? Both actors, Howkey and Gonzaga, try their best given the material but generally disappoint. They feed too much into the typical action comedy trope, making their portrayals almost caricatures. One of the only things the pair has going for them is that they have enough chemistry to convince the audience that their marriage is not broken beyond repair.
It remains unclear why Nix felt the need to adapt Cameron’s successful film into a television series. The CBS original is best described as a 2010s action comedy starring Melisa McCarthy, and while there is nothing wrong with a cheesy, funny, and carefree movie, it simply requires the dramatic support of the big screen. The show proves that not everything needs to be turned into a television show. Overall, “True Lies” is entertaining, but audiences might be better off watching the original.

“My First Summer” is diametrically opposed to my last article on “Brokeback Mountain” in terms of visibility: Neither I nor anyone I know had heard of it. But boy am I glad Letterboxd led me to this gem.
Written and directed by Melbourne-based Katie Found, “My First Summer” is her debut feature film. It is set in rural Australia, where Grace (Maiah Stewardson) stumbles upon a remote house and finds within it a spooked Claudia (Markella Kavenagh). The viewer comes to learn that 16-year-old Claudia’s mother, a novelist, had isolated her daughter from the world — independently raising and teaching her off the grid — due to her belief that the world was full of nothing but evil. This had culminated in a planned murder-suicide in which she and Claudia were to drown themselves in a nearby reservoir. The precise details about the occurrence remain murky, but it appears that Claudia did not follow her mother into the water. Grace finds her the next day terrified, distrusting, alone.
And though this thematic background is decidedly dark, what unfolds is actually quite a sweet, tender story.
The setting itself is vital not only to the narrative, but also to the overall visual feel of the film. The isolated quality of the area draws the viewer’s attention to the minutiae of nature: the leaves on the trees, the wind, the chirping of birds, the still water of the reservoir. The camera capitalizes on this, of course, dedicating shots interspersed between narrative-driving scenes to the sights and sounds of the house and surrounding area. This helps create a multi-sensory viewing experience and weaves an air of pleasant contemplativeness throughout the film.
The general lack of other people within the movie also allows the pure, human connection that develops between Grace and Claudia to resolutely take the foreground. In the quiet solitude that the film cultivates, the viewer becomes particularly attuned to every change in affect or dynamic between the two characters. I found myself enraptured watching Grace’s generosity and patience in introducing Claudia to a world unknown to her, as well as Claudia’s slow but progressive trust in Grace and in the possibilities beyond the edges of the reservoir. Every interaction between the two feels deliberate, consequential, and infused with meaning. Of course, the actresses themselves deserve the highest praises for their work in fostering this viewing environment, particularly since the entire film essentially rests on their shoulders. Stewardson and Kavenagh wear their hearts on their sleeves as Grace and Claudia, channeling an honesty of performance far beyond their years.
The film is most impressive, perhaps, in its ability to perfectly capture the essence of girlhood. Grace, herself, embodies the unabashed brightness of self associated with youth: She wears wacky earrings, fluffy, chiffon-like pink skirts, and colorful bead bracelets without any self-consciousness. She and Claudia revel in the novelty of a cockroach lollipop, the deliciousness of strawberry milk, and the overwhelming variety of the candy stash Grace smuggles to Claudia’s house. They decorate Claudia’s bedroom wall with magazine cutouts, make bracelets on a picnic blanket outside, dye Claudia’s sheets with plum pigment, have a spontaneous sprinkler fight, and splash around in a local pond. These activities provide space for Claudia to regress — in the best way. Having only ever been taught to fear the world, she is finally allowed to enjoy the silliness and fun and spontaneity uniquely associated with childhood, particularly girlhood.
Summer also proves to play a role important enough to warrant a place in the film’s title. The warmth and life of the season could not mesh better with the story’s themes of love, joy, and exploration. It’s a time free from obligation: A time to run around barefoot in the grass, cool off in some water, and bask in the sunlight. This time and this place create a welcoming environment in which Grace and Claudia’s relationship can develop and flourish.
This being said, I was skeptical about the way that the movie would handle its portrayal of the girls’ relationship. Both are said to be 16, and the movie as a whole maintains a theme of innocence and youth; telling a story of love and sexuality correctly given this context is not an easy task. I was, however, pleasantly surprised.
The movie neatly avoids portraying the girls and their bodies in a way that caters to the male gaze. Grace and Claudia are shown in scenes where they are scantily clad, such as when they enter the pond, or even naked, like when they take a bath together; the film does not shy away from portraying their bodies altogether. However, the camera does so in a relatively neutral way. When they are in their underclothes, it shows them from a moderate distance and does not rove over their bodies, and when they are naked, it cuts off below the chest. The scenes in which exposure happens also serve to further the narrative and feel appropriate given the activity being performed. Furthermore, the two share a sexual scene, but even this is portrayed through a lens of believable inexperience, tenderness, and laughter, as well as cuts before anything escalates further. Overall, “My First Summer” can be said to have handled intimacy and exploration of sexuality with care and thoughtfulness.
The film’s weakest point is probably its conveyance of the story of Claudia’s mother. As viewers, we have to infer a lot through snippets of flashbacks that haunt Claudia, and even then I did not feel I had a firm grasp on what their relationship had been like or the details of the circumstances surrounding the attempted murder-suicide. We see Claudia struggle greatly with the traumatic loss of her mother, but it feels somewhat abstract and elusive to us as viewers.
Generally, though, I don’t find that this detracted greatly from the film. I can see it being explained as a deliberate artistic choice to create a surrealist landscape. After all, the concept underlying the whole film is not exactly the most believable — a sequestered girl that nobody knows about, an isolated house, another girl who visits her everyday and introduces her to the world? The mother’s murder suicide is not more or less believable than any of these. The film requires viewers to suspend their disbelief to some extent, but it still manages to effectively convey a magical story at its core.
“My First Summer” (2020) is a relatively new movie, but it unfortunately flew far, far under the radar. To this day, it doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page. Actually, it does, but it’s written in Czech (?).
This lack of popularity is not an accurate reflection of the film’s quality, however. I typically find that enjoyable movies are sadly not always well-made, and vice versa. This movie, however, sits happily at the rare intersection of film quality and genuine entertainment. It is objectively a slow-moving story, but its joyful overtones and captivating dynamics command your attention in a way that helps it resist becoming boring. The acting is stellar, the cinematography is a pleasure to watch, and it is shot with a keen directorial eye that avoids the various traps that a film of this topic could have easily fallen into.
It is also a shame that a film with such a hopeful and sweet essence has gone underappreciated. This is a movie that has heavy elements but that is not dragged down by them; rather, it balances them with the innocence and naivety of two young girls that does border on ignorance, but which add to the lovability of the story. A modest run time of 80 minutes fits a multitude of joys: young love, candy necklaces, blue skies, loyal dogs, warm sun, long hair, flavored chapsticks, and more. It is a representation of the wonderful aspects of carefree life that we, particularly those of us who have experienced girlhood, may feel a pang of nostalgia for. And if none of that is compelling to you, then maybe everyone’s cool Aussie accents will convince you. Either way, “My First Summer” is worth your while — I purple promise.

As the clock hand inched towards 9 PM on Sunday, May 29, Boston Calling’s Green Stage lit up with the infamous “Ecstasy of Gold” scene from the 1966 Western film “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.” When the image of Tuco (played by Eli Wallach) running around the graveyard hit the big screens, Metallica fans instantly knew that this concert would be nothing short of an epic masterpiece.
Instead of following up the cinema clip with their cover of “Ecstasy of Gold,” the Los Angeles band started the show with two hard-hitting ragers: “Whiplash” from their 1983 debut album “Kill ‘Em All,” and “Ride The Lightning” from their sophomore album of the same name. Lars Ulrich’s staccato drum beats accompanied by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield’s menacing growls set a lively energy, proving why Metallica is king of thrash metal.
“Heads are bobbing all around/ it's hot as hell tonight / You're thrashing all around / Acting like a maniac” definitely became the forecast for the rest of the night. Through head-bopping tracks like “Wherever I May Roam,” the band would invite the crowd in on the show, letting their chorus of yeahs act as the metronome for their guitar riffs.
Being by far the most attended day of the three day weekend, their headlining performance faced some high expectations. Safe to say, the Boston crowd was not left disappointed.
Hetfield was constantly interacting with the crowd, with praises like “Y’all are beautiful by the way,” as well as a healthy dose of egging on saying, “That's what I thought” and “Don't stop now” successfully edging them on in the chorus of “Seek & Destroy.” The crowd easily matched the high-pace, high-intensity energy of the band — perhaps due to the significant increase in intoxication as the show progressed. Still, they went silent to hear the complex stacked riffs in songs like “One” and “Sad But True” — and then thrashed around in mosh pits for the impressive bass/guitar battle in “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” where lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo crawled on the ground while flawlessly delivering their runs. Metallica’s meticulous musical production shined on tracks like these, their layered melodies going beyond the default riff-heavy metal sound and setting them apart from the rest.
The black and white LED display flashed during moments like this, yellow shards forming and breaking in the background, making Hammett’s iconic purple guitar stand out amidst the chiaroscuro. Trujillo’s braids bobbing up and down during his energetic solos, the deep, reverberating chords melting into the night. Hetfield himself took no time to relax, stacking two guitars atop each other to show off his finesse. These complex musical progressions would then segue into the chorus of the next song, providing a seamless ebb and flow to the concert.
“In Brazil a woman gave birth at a Metallica concert,” Hetield shared towards the end of their performance, going on to advise the pregnant festival goers to not do so. Pregnant or not, almost everyone stuck around for the encore. How could they leave when Hattfield enticed them with phrases like “Are you alive Boston? Show me how to be alive!” before transitioning into “Battery.” Lyrics of the eternal Metallica family being together for all time really resonated during the live performance, where the musical notes took on a life and narrative of their own.
“I got distracted by how badass I was,” Hammett apologized before restarting the guitar solo on “Nothing Else Matters.” The bridge’s building progression was just as breathtaking the second time around, winding up the melody of one of their most tender and vulnerable tracks ever.
To no one's surprise, Metallica closed out the night — and the whole festival — with their most popular hit, “Enter Sandman.” The hero on this track was Ulrich. The entire band turned their backs to the festival to watch him deliver his superhumanly paced solo as the lights shone out on them and the entire crowd. After a brilliant execution, he stood up on the drums, reveling in the cheers of “Neverland” echoing throughout the stadium.
“The Metallica family together at last and off to never never land,” Hetfield reflected, sticking around for a while after their set had ended to spend more time with the fans. As guitar picks and drum sticks went flying, Ulrich could be heard saying “Am I the only one who thinks that we should be coming around to Boston more often than every 5 fucking years?” Indeed, after a reunion like that, it is clear that the Metallica family cannot get enough of the Boston stage.

It’s challenging for a rap act from Atlanta to find a place for itself at a northeastern, rock-dominant festival —- but that's exactly what EarthGang accomplished on Saturday at Boston Calling. The festival pushed their hour-long set to the Delta Airlines Blue Stage only two hours after King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard pulled out due to a positive Covid test. Despite all odds, they delivered a performance that left the Boston audience chanting for more.
Before EarthGang had even set foot on stage, the crowd was already hyped to the sound of their DJ playing hits like JID’s “Surround Sound” and Gunna’s “pushin P.” Composed of Olu (aka Johnny Venus) and WowGr8 (aka Doctur Dot), the rap duo came out with a bang to perform “Proud of U.” While WowGr8 donned green shorts and a quilted vest, Johnny Venus shedded his shirt altogether and let his dreads loose, emphasizing the gleam of his pharaoh-themed chain in the sunlight. As proud ambassadors of the slogan “We All EarthGang,” their echoing shouts of “I’m proud of you, and you, and you,” would become somewhat of an anthem for the rest of their performance.
The rappers were well-matched in both execution and delivery of their verses. While Johnny Venus vocalized smoothly in the first half of their 2019 single “This Side,” WowGr8 went hard on the fast-paced, punchy lines in the third and fourth verses. That well-oiled chemistry garnered an awed appreciation from the Boston crowd as they joined in to sing the chorus.
EarthGang’s production style of delivering vocalizations smoothly to the lax beat and then ramping up for the high speed bars in later verses translated beautifully into their live performance. The impressive runs to the deep 808s on “BILLI” elicited head bops, while the chorus of “WATERBOYZ” earned screams for the adlib “What’s up man?” and “What’s up gang?” The rappers milked the fan-interaction in moments like this, often starting chants like “When I say Earth, you say Gang” and orchestrating the “La-la-la-la-la, yeah” adlib during “UP.”
Even though not many festival goers knew all the lyrics, the crowd was definitely vibing with the intimate performance. A large part of their popularity was due to how relatable their lyrics were. “It’s been a crazy year. Ain’t everyone make it to see this moment,” EarthGang said, before transitioning into their most recent single, “All Eyes on Me.” Apparently, that message resonated with the crowd, since they cheered loudest in moments when the duo manifested money and good fortune, like the transition into “BLACK PEARLS,” for example. The addition of songs like “Big Love” with Louis The Child and “Run It Up” with Snakehips also enhanced the performance’s accessibility to a wider audience, their EDM beats syncing with the multicolor strobe lights and making the crowd shuffle along to the house tunes.
Clearly, EarthGang knew what they had to do to appease the Boston crowd, proving themselves to be seasoned and versatile performers.
Paying homage to their label, EarthGang repped Dreamville in a majority of their set. “I know these three years have been crazy as fuck but look at us [...] We made it through [...] Y’all look so beautiful right now,” they said as a segue into “Sacrifices,” which is a Dreamville collab with J. Cole. “Down Bad” — another Dreamville track — was definitely a crowd favorite, notable by the way Johnny Venus started off his verse slow and then sped it up to a breakneck pace. Collabs with JID — a fellow Dreamville artist — were also prominent throughout the set, like “Meditate.” “How does it feel to be in a legal state?” EarthGang asked before launching into “1993,” a performance that left puffs of smoke in the air.
Pulling off a rap performance at a festival like Boston Calling is a challenging feat to accomplish for any artist — especially when they are filling in for another act’s stage. EarthGang accomplished the impossible: appealing to old and new fans alike, interacting with the crowd, catering to their style, all without sacrificing the integrity of their own sound. Not only did they pull it off, they did it with a charismatic energy throughout their performance — goofy faces and likable personalities that elicited crowd chants for one more song for minutes after the show ended.

Award-winning author Margaret Atwood, best known for her dystopian novel “The Handmaid’s Tale,” is celebrated internationally for her dozens of works spanning literary forms. Her highly-anticipated, recently released book “Old Babes in the Wood” explores the shared human experiences of family, relationships, loss, and memory through fifteen gripping short stories.
Atwood sat down in conversation with The Harvard Crimson to discuss “Old Babes in the Wood,” her writing process, and how the two relate: she wrote the book to her own taste, and it worked.
When prompted to describe her new book in just a few words, Atwood first said, “a bunch of short stories” — both earnestly and in jest. Upon further thought, she said, “Jokes, griefs, snails, aliens, murders, World War II, and more.” Both of these cryptic descriptions brilliantly highlight the collection as a whole: It is a series of varied stories about varied characters who, while seemingly disconnected ,still thread together with concurrent levity and heaviness.
A married couple, Nell and Tig, serve as the collection’s home — where the collection begins and ends,and where its heart resides — but the couple harmonizes with a multitude of other characters (including a snail in a woman’s body, a young girl raised by a witch, an emergency aid alien, and the ghost of George Orwell) who render the book all the more real.
Atwood described “Old Babes in the Wood” as “an ongoing process, a continuous process.” She explained that writing the book was like pottery: she started with a “lump of clay” and shaped it as it developed, not necessarily with specific inspiration for start or end points. Accordingly, her favorite story in the collection was whichever one she worked on at a given moment.
“The inspiration emerges from the work as you’re doing it,” she said.
Atwood emphasized that no specific idea or incident sparked her to create “Old Babes in the Wood.” She sat down; she wrote. She paid attention to the present and nurtured her art as she moved along with it, a style present in both her writing and speaking. As she spoke, her voice was thoughtful and pensive; her words grew from each other and carried weighty pauses in between.
Despite the broad range of stories in the collection — from “Widows,” a story about grief, to “Metempsychosis,” a story about a woman who believes she is a snail — the stories in “Old Babes in the Wood” are clearly not random.
“There are a lot of people who are going to read the story called ‘Widows’ and know exactly what it is all about,” Atwood said. “Fewer will read the story called ‘Metempsychosis’ and identify with thinking they’re a snail.”
Then, why a snail? Atwood said she wrote about snails because she is “keen on them,” but then she revealed more: they are easier to observe than birds because “they don’t move very fast.”
“Old Babes in the Wood” did not come to Atwood; instead, Atwood came to “Old Babes in the Wood.” She wrote what made sense to her when her mind was in the story. Then, she found what convinced her, what held her attention.
“If it doesn’t hold my attention, it certainly isn’t going to hold anyone else’s,” she said.
Consequently, she was not concerned with the relevance of the book to the reader, or why a reader might want to read it at a given moment.
“That’s a question for a reader to answer,” she said.
It’s a busy moment for Atwood. She brought up the recent ban of “The Handmaid’s Tale” in Madison County, Virginia schools, saying that this is “not [her] first rodeo being banned.” Returning to her alma mater (Radcliffe College, which later merged with Harvard College) to discuss her new book, she mentioned the memory of discovering witchcraft and demonology books in Widener Library as a student because women were not permitted in Lamont Library at the time. With these two topical examples in mind, it is understandable that she would focus her writing toward convincing herself instead of worrying about audience reception. She writes what works, and she writes for herself: a straightforward process.
“Writing is fairly simple,” Atwood said. Even still, “Old Babes in the Wood” is wonderfully complex.

In her new poetry collection “Soft Apocalypse,” which won the 2021 Georgia Poetry Prize, poet Leah Nieboer creates an eerie, neon-backlit, postmodern American universe, populated by characters who find solace and support in each other amidst a setting of pockmarked, post-industrial ruin. Despite verse that is at times agonizingly sparse and unnecessarily twisted, the collection embodies a distinct, cohesive sense of hope and companionship that ties together the vivid, bright pink “beloveds” — Nieboer’s characters — in her poems. As the reader walks delicately through this world, pirouetting through dioramas and revolving nights, their sense of time and the physical spaces around them are slowly reoriented.
Stepping through the revolving door of the opening poem “ONLY IN MY NIGHTS DID THE WORLD SLOWLY REVOLVE,” the speaker meets an “implausible cosmonaut / in her heart-shaped sunglasses / in her slick ruby suit.” This cosmonaut conjures up images of Lorraine Broughton, the titular undercover spy from “Atomic Blonde”: slick and sexy, bringing posh into the arena of destruction.
The collection is thus littered with these fields of destruction as Nieober convincingly paints the dying vestiges of the world as a production machine whose goal is to strip away our deep-rooted connections with each other and with humanity at large. In “FLASH PROCESSING OF A PRIVATE YEAR,” this production machine comes at odds with the speaker’s health. When the speaker goes to the pharmacy dispensary, a central location in Nieboer’s poems, the clinical lists of medical terms and diagnoses in front of the “fissure window” mimic the “uneasy cosmology” of navigating illness in daily life when the structures of work and capital actively oppose rest and remedy.
The speaker’s hopelessness in this poem motivates her to take “a bright pink pill” as the “kiss of an answer,” further perpetuating her illness and desperation. Form marries content as the speaker describes how, after taking the pill, she sees a “prayer” as a “glittering record inside of what an unfeeling sentence.” Even hopeful ideas of “prayer” here are co-opted by the uninspired machinations of the hard-edged world through bounds of structure, diction, and form — the structures through which the speaker views and experiences the world.
In the depths of the coarse, roughened remnants of “what had once been a great city,” however, the speaker finds a “soft underside.” In “MINOR EVENTS 2,” they realize that one can “pretend” to be a cosmonaut, a “private explorer” swimming to the “edge of a dazzling pool.” In “THINGS HAVE GONE BACK TO BEING WHAT THEY WERE,” Nieboer’s language invites a camaraderie between the gashes in nature and the tenderness of human hands: “I stood on a roof half-dressed watching a / jet wake stretch itself into the most insane blue you’ll ever / in sunlight see.” Under the speaker’s loving gaze, sidewalks nurse cracks and dresses stitch together their tears.
Some of the sparse verse, quick enjambments, and inconsistent diction in the collection, though, prevents some poems’ conclusions from feeling satisfactory, leaving the reader afloat in a sea of free-flowing ideas and images. In “Washed Up Ultraviolet Morning,” the italicized “giving thought to distances” and “we could try a different location” seem unmoored from the lines before or after, creating a decentralized, sporadic feeling to the reading process that feels unintentional. In the same poem, the speaker shares a dream of “an edible flower / its round leaves / a buttery orange / expression of // nasturtium.” The enjambments here seem breathless, diluted rather than crystallized. In “Space Without Map,”
“someone’s forgotten something
important –
the hour bows down
a body bends to the curve
exceeding the function
the sound of
the moment slips”
The line never finishes — the “function” is never verbalized or explained in full. Instead, the poem stutters: “the sound of / the moment slips.” The incompleteness of the line creates a slightly frustrated reading process. Nieboer’s use of indented and free form alongside italics also dilutes the poem and distracts the reader further.
Despite some confusing technical and syntactical choices, Nieboer nevertheless imbues the collection with a vivid celebration of hope and friendship. Love for the body, the self, and the humans that share this earth are equally important to celebrate in Nieboer’s poems. “It’s important to me / to memorize one’s own / temporary address,” she writes in “SPACE WITHOUT MAP,” referring to the body itself. In this poem, the speaker, and Nieboer herself, celebrates our bodies as vessels that have carried us through countless “soft apocalypses” and more. The book ends with the speaker sitting with “gorgeous people” in the back of a stretch limousine, narrating, “we were here giving each other / explicit reasons / to go on.” The speaker clearly and forwardly celebrates the individuals that make life worth living. The ending is a tribute to the project of the entire poetry collection: an ode to friendship and companionship despite the aberrations of the glowing anemic world.

The holiday of Purim is popular among the Jewish community for various reasons — delicious feasting and hamantaschen, bright and colorful costumes, and festive songs and spiels abound. This night of revelry is topped off with a dramatic reading of the Megillah — also known as the Book of Esther — telling the story of Purim. While the themes of freedom from persecution and maintaining one’s faith in G-d are echoed in most of the Jewish holidays, Purim is unique in that its story features a female heroine, Queen Esther, explicitly centering women in its narrative.
The Purim story is set in motion by the actions of Esther’s predecessor, Queen Vashti, whose headstrong nature threatens her own freedom. The Megillah opens with a resplendent feast celebrating the wealth and glory of Persia, given by King Ahasuerus in the city of Shushan. When Ahasuerus demands that his queen dance before the courtiers unclothed so that they may also see her beauty, Vashti refuses out of personal pride, arousing his ire. She is banished from the kingdom (and in some versions, executed) for her defiance — her rash actions are severely punished and her rule soon forgotten.
Esther is then chosen to be Ahasuerus’s new queen, and her cautious passivity is at odds with Vashti’s stubborn assertiveness. Throughout the story, she hides her Jewish identity from the King, but when the king’s evil advisor Haman hatches a plan to exterminate the Jews, she is urged by her cousin Mordecai to intervene and save the Jewish people.
However, it’s not so simple for Queen Esther. Approaching the king without summons is punishable by death, and after the cautionary tale of Queen Vashti, Esther is more than hesitant to come forward. After the Jewish people fast and pray for her safety, Esther finally musters up the courage to confront Ahasuerus, but in her own way: She first asks him to feast with her and Haman, but when it comes time to make her announcement, she invites them to another feast. This continues until she works up the courage to condemn Haman and vouch for her people.
When she finally gains the strength to speak out and protect her people, she is rewarded for her bravery; the king is furious with Haman at persecuting the people of his Queen and has him hanged, and Esther and Morcedai are hailed as heroes.
Esther and Vashti emerge as clear foils to each other in the Purim story. Vashti is headstrong and assertive, which she is heavily punished for, while Esther is docile and submissive — the perfect queen. She dutifully obeys the commands of Mordecai and Ahasuerus, the two men in her life, until their conflicting expectations are at odds with each other and the jeopardy of her freedom demands action. However, Esther acts with care in her own measured way, saving the Jewish people while remaining in good graces with the king.
While Esther is the obvious hero of the story, Vashti deserves credit in her own right. Esther is unimaginably brave, but in some ways she is still complicit in patriarchal rule, playing by the king’s rules and bending them just enough to prevent a Jewish genocide. While this caution is perhaps necessary, it is Vashti who truly defies the patriarchy and abandons it altogether through her firm refusal to yield to the king’s petty, objectifying wish.
The story appears to condemn and discard Vashti for her disobedience as Esther sweeps in to save the day. However, a more nuanced interpretation suggests that the king is the real villain of the Purim tale: Fickle and capricious mood swings, lewd demands that dishonor his queenly wife, and dumb complicity in Haman’s evil actions show Ahasuerus to be a weak and impressionable king. It is reasonable to assume that a king who impulsively decrees that the Jews shall be exterminated may also be incorrect in punishing Vashti. Her banishment demonstrates that a powerful woman was seen as a potent threat in this patriarchal world, leading her to martyrdom.
In fact, feminists have frequently placed Vashti, not Esther, on a pedestal, lauding her as an ancient symbol of female empowerment. First-wave feminists hailed her as an icon for her refusal to abide by her husband’s misogynistic demands — Harriet Beecher Stowe praised Vashti’s resistance as a “first stand for women’s rights,” and Elizabeth Cady Stanton described her as “a sublime representative of self-centered womanhood.” Both feminists lauded her as a paragon of dignity and self-respect, with Stowe writing that “we shall stand amazed that there was a woman found at the head of the Persian empire that dared to disobey the command even of a drunken monarch.”
Modern feminism also celebrates Vashti. For example, theologian Laverne McCain Gill describes Vashti as a model of rebellion against the patriarchy, and Old Testament scholar Alice Laufey argues that Vashti appeals to modern feminists over the main heroine of the story because of her lack of complicity in the patriarchy in comparison to Esther.
Truthfully, both women can be celebrated as feminist heroes in their own ways. While Esther initially plays the role of passive consort — as the replacement of a willful queen, she knows she is meant to embody the antithesis of Vashti’s character — she eventually must discover Vashti’s courage in herself, even if that means risking her life and kingdom. Esther’s mild-mannered temperament is her saving grace as it enables her to access spaces others cannot and eventually subvert those qualities to save the day.
Beyond empowering individual women, the story also associates their autonomy with Jewish liberation in a compelling parallel analogy. While many stories feature Jewish heroes fighting against their persecutors and emerging victorious, the Purim story is unique in that the safety of the Jewish people is dependent on a female heroine taking a stand against a patriarchal monarchy, thus linking Jewish liberation directly to the feminist experience. With this new perspective on Purim, we can better appreciate the story and celebrate the brave Jewish women who ensured the safety of their people and became a powerful symbol of feminist empowerment.

“If you see something… put it in the chat,” Special Agent Christian White said.
He grinned as he encouraged audience members to surveil one another with a cheeky version of “see something, say something.” Played by Bruce France, Special Agent White was the sole performer in “COINTELSHOW: A Patriot Act,” a political satire written by playwright L.M. Bogad about COINTELPRO, the real-life FBI counterintelligence program operating from 1956 to 1971. Presented by ArtsEmerson and directed by Nick Slie and Dan Pruksarnukul from multidisciplinary art company Mondo Bizarro Productions, “COINTELSHOW” was adapted to a Zoom format and took advantage of the platform’s features to create a uniquely immersive experience, leaving audience members hungry to learn more about our country’s hidden history.
“COINTELSHOW” follows Special Agent White, an FBI official for public relations, as he brings the audience on a tour through COINTELPRO. The program aimed to sabotage and repress activists such as Fred Hampton and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as domestic political groups like the American Indian Movement, Black Panther Party, and Communist Party U.S.A. Special Agent White is tailored effectively as a convincing authoritative figure as he appears primly-dressed in a suit and tie, maintains a charismatic smile, and delivers carefully-curated, propaganda-esque speech. Yet, as he comically strives to defend authentic examples of incriminating COINTELPRO documents, audience members can see the true sinister nature of the program.
While virtual theater may initially seem disengaging, “COINTELSHOW” overwhelmingly avoided this issue through Special Agent White’s direct address to the audience throughout the play. As audience members were asked to scrutinize one another and watch for suspicious behavior, “COINTELSHOW” ironically leveraged the audience in the same way that it implies the FBI does in actuality.
Moreover, audience interaction was impressively initiated before the play began. Prior to its start, attendees were asked to fill out a pre-show audience survey — gathering feedback just as a government agency may often do. Audience members then became part of the bureaucratic process as their responses were reviewed during the show. This parody not only added comedic value to the production, but also generated further interest and unity from the audience, as attendees watched their peers attentively and saw themselves reflected in the presentation.
“COINTELSHOW” also took advantage of Zoom’s features to construct its setting. Despite the lack of a physical set, virtual backgrounds transported Special Agent White to specific time periods in history. The eerie atmosphere was established with sudden transitions to and from Zoom “breakout rooms,” as audience members anxiously braced for what might pop up next. Live and pre-recorded elements were integrated seamlessly as Special Agent White conducted his real-time PR presentation in real-time one moment, but was transported to a physically manufactured landscape — a site filmed prior — at the next. These tactics allowed for the plotline to be more flexible in incorporating historic flashbacks or imaginative representations to illustrate remote scenarios and issues effectively.
Although “COINTELSHOW” offered a masterful, creative use of an online format, the execution, at times, left much to be desired. The plotline, for instance, felt disjointed at times. The show consisted of various, distinct segments which occasionally lacked sufficient convincing setup and were not always well-integrated, making it difficult to determine how to understand these pieces.
In addition, while most segments were inventive and amusing, they sometimes felt too on-the-nose. Special Agent White beseeching a “right to privacy” when encountering a transcript of his every unfiltered thought directly to the audience, or suffering a “cold war” within his own skull between his left and right brain, was grimly entertaining, but it was a bit too plainly ironic in execution as the critical takeaways were unnecessarily spelled out for audience members.
While the satirical aspects may not have landed perfectly with the audience, the message was certainly received. From a plethora of creative settings and interspersed media to tactics for audience engagement, “COINTELSHOW” brought a humorous, intriguing spin to this part of American history, challenging attendees to examine these structures for activist disruption and political surveillance readily accepted today.

Wasalu “Lupe Fiasco” Jaco smiles at event attendees. A Grammy award-winning rapper and a visiting scholar at MIT, Lupe Fiasco led an event for Harvard Law School affiliates to learn about the Royal Game of Ur this March.
Wasserstein Hall, the location of Lupe Fiasco’s Ur event, is located at Harvard Law School. The event was hosted by the HLS Recording Artists Project.
Crimson arts reporter Dylan R. Ragas and other participants watch as Fiasco explains the basics of Ur — the oldest board game in the world — which involves two players and originates from ancient Mesopotamia.
Participants begin to play Ur. Harvard affiliates, including alumni, faculty, and students, were present.
Ragas asks event leaders a question. Sophia Hasenfus, organizer and staff member at MIT, explains that the société internationale d'UR has been “running tournaments, teaching people how to play Ur, [and] telling people about the history of Ur” through events like this one.
Lupe Fiasco assists participants as they begin to learn Ur. Mo Light, participant and HLS alumnus, attended the event because he “heard that [his] friends were coming and that Lupe Fiasco was going to be here.”
A group of participants gather to observe Ragas’s practice game. “What’s so funny is, when I was thirteen, I made a cover of ‘Words I Never Said’ and I uploaded it to YouTube, and I had to unlist it because it was terrible,” Light noted. “But I’m here to redeem myself and have a good night and play Ur.”
Players and observers smile, enjoying a game of Ur. The tournament was conducted with multiple elimination rounds, culminating in a one-on-one final competition for a premium Ur board.
Lupe Fiasco holds up an Ur board, emphasizing that the tournament is structured for everyone to enjoy themselves and have a good time. Fiasco’s love for Ur is evident as competitors learned a lot under his guidance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the ongoing green-clad Saint Patrick’s day festivities around Fenway, a long line of black wrapped a mile down the block outside of House of Blues in the early evening of March 18. It appeared as though every indie-rock aficionado in the greater Boston area chose to forgo the traditional St. Paddy’s weekend bar crawl in favor of celebrating with their favorite Irish punk-pop quartet. Grunge band “Inhaler,” took to the stage at 9 p.m. for their “Cuts & Bruises,” tour, performing their 2023 album of the same name.
It was obvious as Inhaler walked on stage that they were planning on fostering a quintessential angst-filled concert experience for alternative music enthusiasts from all corners of Boston to indulge in. By the end of their set, the band accomplished this goal with flying colors.
The set design was simple: a plain black backdrop with the word “Inhaler” painted across it in bright white ink, classic laser lights with no apparent color scheme, a few stand microphones and a drum set with the Inhaler logo displayed on the front. The white logo on the backdrop changed color depending on its lighting, bringing a unique stage presence to each song. This was the only uniquity of the stage design; a fact which was of no detriment to the performance.
If it weren’t for the hundreds of phones held up by adoring fans trying to capture several moments of the concert for social media consumption, one could mistake themselves to be watching a yet-to-be-discovered young garage band perform. This ambiance was only intensified by the content of their music; lyrics about young love, coming of age themes and living in the moment seep into each of their songs whether they are from the “Cuts & Bruises” album or not.
As Inhaler opened with the upbeat free-spirited anthem “These are The Days,” the energy in the pit was electric. The audience happily sang along as the music melted into the 2019 single “My Honest Face.” The band would have blown through their set with immense momentum had it not been for the brief intermissions prompted by lead singer Elijah Hewson who slowly switched out guitars after every other song.
That being said, Hewson’s stage presence is a force to be reckoned with. The front man has mastered the art of the chaotically earnest, boyishly charming-with-a-dark-side European rockstar archetype most recently popularly embodied by Matty Healy of “The 1975.” 30 or so minutes into his own set, the singer/guitarist coolly asked his audience “What’s the next song again?” to which those who have memorized the set list enthusiastically respond. His fans clearly adore his hijinks.
The authentic quirkiness exemplified by Hewson’s persona penetrated throughout the set. Later in the night, audience members would watch bassist Robert Keating and guitarist Josh Jenkinson saunter towards drummer Ryan McMahon, casually exchanging words in the middle of songs as if they weren’t in a professional rock band actively performing in a packed venue. Seemingly uncalculated details such as this contributed to the authenticity of the performance.
This nonchalant attitude, explicitly communicated via Hewson’s continuous interludes, is also evident in the band’s presentation. They boast messy, undone hair, unbuttoned collared shirts, and jeans. They don’t attempt to put on any complex song-and-dance with choreography or costumes. The feelings evoked by their music are reinforced by their simple, down to earth, yet fashionable approach to performing it.
However, this laissez-faire energy is certainly not evidence of a lack of passion.  These artists do not shy away from the angst inherent in their genre of music. As fans screamed “I fuckin’ hate that bitch” while listening to “My King Will Be Kind” (2021), it was clear that the audience found themselves in the midst of the stereotypical teenage grunge-rock concert that young adult media has been advertising forever. One felt like they were living in a black and white Tumblr post from 2012, amplified by Hewson sarcastically shouting “You guys sound great!” into his microphone, eliciting laughs from the audience.
Overall, Inhaler's “Cuts & Bruises” concert was thoroughly entertaining. It was enjoyable to watch the audience call for an encore over and over again 30 minutes before the end of the scheduled set. It was even more enjoyable to watch the band grant said encore, having disposed of their jackets backstage and blasting “If You’re Gonna Break My Heart” in their most dynamic and engaging performance of the night; the audience was truly hanging on to Hewson’s every word. It was exciting to watch McMahon toss his drum sticks into the audience as the band offered cheers to their fans with their drinks before leaving the stage for the final time. For anyone looking for a fun, good old-fashioned indie-rock concert, the “Cuts & Bruises” tour definitely has something to offer.

What is Gigi Hadid doing on Netflix reality TV?
On March 3, Netflix released season two of “Next in Fashion,” its reality competition show following 12 fashion designers battling to win the competition. In several days or even hours, designers race to construct fashionable looks according to a theme, which are presented on the runway before the judges decide who to crown and who to eliminate. While not the showstopper in Netflix’s expanding reality TV collection, “Next in Fashion” is an upbeat, diverse, and decidedly less infuriating production from the streaming service’s now-polished reality show mold.
Slightly different from season one, this season’s prizes include $200,000 and a collection launch on Rent the Runway, a luxury clothing rental service. Also different from season one: Gigi Hadid’s replacement of fellow model Alexa Chung as host. She’s not the only celebrity appearance: Guest judges include Donatella Versace, Emma Chamberlain, and Hailey Bieber.
At times, “Next in Fashion”’s neon aesthetic and nonstop hip-hop and pop backing tracks teeter on tiring. Yet the designers’ much more sophisticated creations are anything but. It’s pure fun to form one’s opinions during the runway shows, with the vicarious eye of an haute couture stylist. The hosts’ outfits are also fun, especially when Hadid shows up in her 2022 Met Gala look for the “Met Gala” themed episode — the viewer is bound to fangirl as much as the designers.
As surreal as Gigi Hadid’s presence is, she and co-host Tan France — of “Queer Eye” fame — are warmly human. Holding hands, making up nicknames (“Tanny?”), and visiting workstations, Hadid and France emulate the “Great British Bake Off”’s beloved hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. Both sets of hosts even start each episode with a theme-appropriate skit. Though sweet and bubbly, the “Next in Fashion'' duo aren’t quite engaging enough to match the show’s strongest element: the fashion.
Hadid and France’s genuine care for the contestants — evidenced by their tears over some eliminations — is undermined by want for the quirky, unscripted conversations that render all of the contestants’ personalities more accessible to the viewer. Backstories containing the typical tearjerkers consume the rest of their speaking time, coming off as part of the reality formula, as genuine as they are. As the cast communicates with a plethora of LGBTQ slang (“big slay,” “it’s giving,” and even the fearsome critique “crafty” of “RuPaul’s Drag Race”), they share a common trendy language but invent nothing iconic or memorable. This season’s contestants are generally more forgettable than last season, with its whimsical and endearing winner Minju Kim.
Still, the contestants and their camaraderie are hard not to like. After a paired challenge in which Nigel Xavier teaches Deontré Hancock some patchwork techniques, Hancock incorporates patchwork into his own design in a gratifying moment of creative osmosis. The respect between designers and models allows the viewer to appreciate pure creative talent, unmarred by fabricated drama. One model accidentally rips Bao Tranchi’s dress, but Tranchi — one of the more businesslike, serious contestants — fixes it and hugs her. The decency of the cast speaks for itself. Any competitiveness is utterly peaceful in comparison to the mayhem of other reality competitions.
While fairly unexceptional in format, the highlight of “Next in Fashion” is its diversity. In the “Childhood” challenge, transgender designer James Ford reimagines a childhood pre-transition outfit as menswear. Qaysean Williams, who has Erb’s palsy, dubs himself the “one hand sewing man.” Vietnamese refugee Tranchi recounts her mother’s job in a sweatshop. This visibility of the fashion industry’s failings is critical. The finalists’ disadvantages in their field imbue the prize with real magnitude, creating hope for an underrepresented designer to claim a space in high fashion with needed financial support.
The seamless diversity of the runway models is also a promising divergence from the exaggerated applause and controversy that often surrounds bodily representation in media. In one challenge, models sport the designers’ reimaginations of their birth decades, ranging from the ’50s to the ’90s. The show’s diversity and the hosts’ empathetic ear for the designers’ stories exhibit its honesty among shows studded with tokenism.
Perhaps the most questionable moment of the season is Danny Godoy’s elimination after Episode Five, “Collaboration.” After Godoy makes seven pieces to his partner Ford’s one, the judges criticize their designs as lacking “elevation”. However, nothing justifies their loss to Hancock and O’Cain, whose designs are aesthetically and thematically messy. The abrupt cutoff of Godoy’s potential is dispiriting after his frustration with the inexperienced Ford, but it ultimately seems like an understandable mistake within a series of reasonable eliminations.
The show seesaws between artistic legitimacy and reality show skepticism. Versace and Chamberlain, both highly recognizable guests, represent wildly different aspects of the fashion world. Themes like “Thrift Wear” and “Met Gala” cater to viral style, while “Royalty” and “Everything Old is New” encourage more reliance on costume than innovation. Netflix also sacrifices experience for celebrity status, for example, with guest judges “Emily in Paris” actress Ashley Park, influencer Emma Chamberlain, and a disproportionate number of supermodels. While the “Transformation” challenge alludes to current fashion breakthroughs — like Coperni’s viral spray-on dress — is it also, by now, already done? It’s dubious at best that the show has actually paved the way for what’s next in fashion as an art form. The judging process seems much more valid when rewarding wearability, adept construction, and a strong visual identity. Perhaps a less sophisticated angle would allow better immersion into the show’s mission. Ultimately, the disconnect between mainstream Netflix elements and avant-garde emphasis is just distracting.
Although “Next in Fashion” won’t transform the fashion industry like its tagline claims, the undeniably skillful design it showcases and its personable, diverse cast make it an enjoyable watch. If not exceptional, it is earnest — and earnest is rare and refreshing in reality TV.

Comprised of individual artists Lucy Dacus, Julien Baker, and Phoebe Bridgers, the indie supergroup known as boygenius originally came together in 2018 to release their aptly titled debut album, “boygenius.” Now, after a four year break, the group is back with a second album, “the record,” which is set to be released on March 31.
Boygenius has released four singles off of the album so far, the latest being “Not Strong Enough” on March 1. Though fans may view four singles — which make up a third of the album— as too much to release in advance of the album, “Not Strong Enough” is arguably deserving of this special status, as it greatly differentiates itself from the previous three releases in lyrics, tone, and form.
Notably, “Not Strong Enough” features an intricate layering of vocals, in which the artists offer both solos and harmonies. The song opens with a verse sung by Bridgers’s gentle voice and transitions to a two-part harmony with Baker for the chorus; Baker’s strong vocals are then featured in the next verse. The bridge begins with just Dacus’s calm, low voice, which lends itself nicely to a gradual harmony. The unique vocals of all three artists come together with the strong use of the guitar in the background, as it begins and ends the song and supports the addition of more intricate instrumentals throughout.
The most pivotal component of “Not Strong Enough,” however, is its lyrics. In contrast to the previous three releases from “the record,” the lyrics center on internal dialogue and questioning. Complex, vivid imagery allows listeners to absorb the emotions behind the lyrics, with lines such as “black hole opened in the kitchen” and “stop staring at the ceiling fan” conveying a picture of deep anguish and self-hatred indescribable by adjectives alone. The repetition of the line “I don’t know why I am” contributes to these feelings of yearning, shame, and extreme self-consciousness. The bridge consists simply of the line “always an angel, never a god” repeated twelve times, conveying a feeling of being lost, weak, and — quite literally — not strong enough.
“Not Strong Enough” also sets itself apart from the previous releases with its accompanying music video. Self-shot by the artists, the video presents itself as a home movie of a summer road trip, in which Dacus, Baker, and Bridgers visit everyday sites such as arcades, museums, and roller coasters. The juxtaposition between these seemingly carelessly joyful scenes and the dark, self-searching lyrics is profound, conveying the idea that not all struggles are visible. Despite this contrast, however, the video contains several subtle yet purposeful artistic choices. For example, the three artists comically pose with ancient busts in a museum, giving a visual depiction of the “god complex” theme conveyed in the lyrics. Similarly, the video ends with them playing with colorful smoke bombs in the dark, aptly complementing the lyric “I think I’m having revelations.”
Overall, the dynamic yet contrasting vocals of Dacus, Baker, and Bridgers, along with the complex lyrics and intricate music video create a stunning masterpiece that manages to turn the most gruesome mental breakdown into a work of art, yet still avoids the romanticization of these struggles.
Fans can look forward to the release of the full album later this month, which will be followed by their Coachella appearance in April and their international summer tour.

Luke Bar$ is a rapper from Brockton, Massachusetts that has been gaining traction in the hip-hop underground through his compelling storytelling and introspective lyrics. Bar$ has forged a distinct sound across his recent releases that reflects his personal journey growing up in Brockton. “Angels Never Die,” his latest album, released in January, is an homage to the people he’s lost.
“Seeing peers pass away, ‘Angels Never Die’ was something I was saying to myself to keep my spirits up,” the rapper said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “It came from that, but also seeing celebrities like Kobe Bryant pass on, but I don’t feel like their energy is gone because people still talk about them.”
Bar$ is an integral member of the burgeoning hip-hop collective Van Buren Records, founded in 2014. As the collective's popularity continues to soar, they have become the face of New England music on Spotify, modeled for prominent Boston clothing retailer Bodega, and received collaboration offers from the likes of Danny Brown. The collective's origins trace back to the long-lasting friendships among the members forged during their years in middle and high school.
“I knew all of them from the beginning,” Bar$ said. “VB has two different eras. It's the older heads and the younger heads. When they first started, I was still in high school. I started to come out around 2016 and I met everyone around that era. I didn't become officiated into VB, until around 2019. But up until that point, we were always connected to one another and in tune.”
The group's name pays homage to the Van Buren Boys gang from Season 8 of Seinfeld. The collective's focus is on elevating each other and Brockton through music. Last summer, Van Buren Records performed at Boston Calling. Following the release of their latest group album “DSM,” the crew headlined their own concert at Paradise Rock Club last December. The show featured a supporting lineup of other local artists like Kei. Bar$ remains committed to Van Buren, but is also working to establish his own solo career.
“I think everyone wants to label VB as a boyband,” Bar$ said. “We’re not and that gets me so mad sometimes. I think that's why I'm really adamant that I'm a solo artist.”
“I don't plan on releasing any Van Buren music for a little bit because we gotta go back into solo pocket,” he added. “At the end of the day, we love each other. And we're doing this with one another, but we all have our own different agendas of what this game means.”
Since joining Van Buren Records, Luke Bar$ has released a steady flow of solo work. His 2019 EP, “GoodEvil,” showcases his introspective lyricism and vivid storytelling with standout tracks like “Die With Pride.” His second album, “Angels Never Die” released in January, has garnered critical acclaim and features “Tables Turn,” a collaborative track between the Brockton rapper and Dorchester superstar Cousin Stizz. Their partnership has the potential to inspire a new generation of artists from Massachusetts, proving that the state has a wealth of talent to offer the music industry.
“We went to New York for two weeks, then L.A. for two weeks and we linked up with Stizz during that time,” said Bar$. “I played him music, that particular song, which already had a verse on it and he was like, ‘Yo, this is different, bro. I wanna put a verse on it.’ And then, we just did that.”
A notable aspect of Luke Bar$'s music is his ability to paint vivid pictures of his upbringing in Brockton. The rapper worked closely with longtime collaborator and producer Kiron Akil to create the beats and aesthetic for “Angels Never Die.” Showing off his hometown roots, the music video for lead single “Get the Gat” was filmed in Brockton.
“I was very vulnerable,” the rapper said about his creative process. “Once you leave my music, you feel something. I’m provoking emotion through music.”
“This one was different because I think me and Kiron really got closer as friends,” he added. “We would just talk on some personal shit before making music and just spent hours with one another.”
With more solo music in his future, Bar$ is currently preparing to launch on a three-city tour beginning in April.
“Whatever the case may be, whether you're inspired, sometimes you're uncomfortable,” Bar$ said. “I say things that make you like, ‘Damn, he just said that.’ You might feel awkward, but you're gonna feel emotions.”

The Mary Wallopers are one of the rising stars of Irish traditional music. The band gained widespread online popularity through their livestreamed gigs from the home of the Hendy brothers, Charles and Andrew, and have since expanded from the original trio (the brothers with Sean McKenna) to a seven-piece outfit. Their self-titled debut album was released in October of last year, after which the band announced their first tour in North America.
After stops in Washington and Philadelphia, they found themselves in Boston, a center of Irish culture in America, two days before St. Patrick’s Day, performing to a sold-out crowd at the Middle East’s Sonia in Cambridge. In an era when much popular and award-winning Irish traditional music has sonically ventured down a more minimalist or ambient path, the band’s promotionals promised performances akin to the rousing gigs of The Pogues and The Dubliners, the great Celtic bands of yesteryear.
At the Sonia, orange and green lights lit up the stage as the band entered. Charles’s fist pumps livened up the already energized crowd. Andrew took the stage with an “Hasta la victoria siempre” Che Guevara shirt; the band prides themselves on not shying away from Irish folk music’s inherently political nature. They cruised into their first song, a little ditty in their thick Dundalk brogues poking fun at the late Queen Elizabeth, much to the crowd’s amusement.
After the first number, the brothers addressed the elephant not in the room: Sean McKenna. They explained how he missed their American tour because of a marijuana offense, laughing the affair away in true high-spirited Mary Walloper fashion. As the crowd laughed at the misfortune of one from the original trio, the band kicked off their first jaunty pub song of the evening, “Rothsea-O.” Between verses, Andrew and Charles paused for some curse-filled banter with the audience, which the crowd embraced.
The next few numbers highlighted the band’s musical flair, showing their depth beyond the spectacle. “Oh Roger Rum,” which illustrated what happens to rich people when they “inevitably meet their untimely horrible painful death,” according to Charles, featured a three-part vocal harmony with only Charles’s bodhrán backing. “The Turfman From Ardee” showcased the band’s instrumental breadth. Andrew’s banjo and vocal intro was soon layered with drums, bass, accordion, and the uilleann pipes, turning the song into a good old fashioned session tune.
image id=1362256 align=center size=large caption=true
At this point, the concert took a brief turn. The band cleared the stage while Charles stepped up to the mic with his guitar. He tried and failed to calm the audience down, finally shouting “Shut up or you’re English!” to settle the rowdy ones. His solo of the song made famous by the Dubliners, “Building Up and Tearing England Down,” momentarily hushed the crowd, aside from their brief resurgence every time the titular line was sung. At one point, Charles was hit by one of the venue's many empty cans (perhaps thrown by a solitary and slighted English royalist in the crowd), but this only fueled the song’s vitality.
Next, Andrew took his brother’s spot with only a bodhrán in hand. Like his brother, Andrew had trouble quieting the unruly audience. When he began to beat lightly on the drum, however, a hush fell over the room, and he began the haunting lament of the old John O’Halloran, an Irish laborer in “god-forsaken” England. The song’s sorrow and longing floated across the room on Andrew’s distinctive wavering yet spirited voice.
This mood was never going to last long, however, and soon the whole band returned to the stage. From the time the band played the classic Eileen Og to the end of their set, there was nothing but “Irish rock and roll” (a term they use for their music). The banjo led straight into “Cod Liver Oil & The Orange Juice,” the hit off their first EP, 2019’s “A Mouthful of The Mary Wallopers, which helped propel them to fame. The band finished with a couple of fast-paced jigs from the new album. The accordion and the pipes were stealing the show until a woman from the audience hopped up on stage between the brothers, turned to the crowd, and did an Irish stepdance routine to the music. The Mary Wallopers, good-spirited as ever, were unfazed and continued playing, much to the delight of the cheering audience.
The band could not play a finale of their three hardest-rocking tunes then leave the crowd at peak energy levels; the audience needed an encore. And, of course, The Mary Wallopers delivered. On that St. Patrick’s Day Eve Eve, the Guinness had been flowing aplenty; an ode to the “jolly jolly grog” was in order. They finished in style with the last song on their album, the Dubliners’ classic, the pub song classic, “All For Me Grog.” The dance floor quaked and the crowd all sang but Andrew’s vocals and the piercing tin whistle still cut through until the very end. On this one night, The Mary Wallopers electrified Boston with the music of the rocking Irish trad bands of yesteryear, reassuring all that the present and future of the genre are in good hands.

In the intimate setting of Boston’s Paradise Rock Club, audience members gathered around on the floor in front of the stage, standing mere feet away from alternative band Little Image during the band’s March 8 performance. The sounds of heavy bass and snare drums filled up the entire venue easily, reverberating through every member of the audience and reaching every corner of the room. Even the smallest movements by the members were observable to viewers, despite how far they stood.
For Little Image — a small indie rock band hailing from Dallas, Texas — the intimacy of the venue didn’t seem to hinder their performance at all, nor did it subdue the excitement and action of their performance. This band of three has been opening for American indie rock band Colony House’s “The Cannonballers” tour for the past month, and played several songs from their upcoming album, “SELF-TITLED,” along with a few fan favorites from their previous works and debut album, “Musings.”
Dressed in custom black suits covered in little white doodles and song names, vocalist Jackson “Jack” Simmons, drummer Troy Bruner, and bass and synth player Brandon Walters immediately drew the attention of the crowd as they entered the red-lit stage, prepping for a vocal and instrumental intensive set. Simmons effortlessly took center stage, with Bruner to his right and Walters to his left, before greeting an enthusiastic crowd with remarks about how excited he was to perform in Boston again.
image id=1362248 align=center size=large caption=true
The stage production was simple. Bright lights shone down on a raised stage in the otherwise dimly-lit venue. A light fog under a collection of miniature flashing multi-colored spotlights gave a futuristic feel to the entire experience, especially as Little Image played some of their grungier pieces like “WORTH IT” with vocal distortions. As the lights changed with the moods of each song, the audience was bathed in shades of blue, red, white, green, and other colors.
Despite some of the audience’s unfamiliarity with Little Image’s music, the band’s exceptional stage presence kept the audience invested in each song. Simmons's vocal confidence, oscillating between soothing lullabies and screeching metal in songs like “BALLET,” added an extra flair to the band’s music. Bruner stuck with straightforward, heavy drumming, and Walters could be seen alternating between playing his guitar and layering tracks on his synth keyboard. Similarly, Bruner and Walters leaned into playing slightly extended versions of songs from their band's upcoming album, adding extra measures or filling gaps with rhythmic drum groove-fills and impressive guitar riffs. While the audience may not have sung along to all of their songs, Walters's guitar and Bruner’s drums filled in the gaps between Simmon’s singing, as these unexpected yet beautifully executed additions left the audience cheering in approval.
image id=1362252 align=center size=large caption=true
Simmons stood out as Simmons moved about the stage with the familiarity of a seasoned performer, hopping about as he sang through the group’s heavier rock tracks like “EGO” and “OUT OF MY MIND.” As the band’s lead vocalist and unofficial frontman, he spoke on behalf of the other members, introducing himself and his bandmates to the audience. At one point during the show, he even took a brief pause between songs to point out a woman in the audience who was wearing a blazer that nearly matched his and his bandmates’ custom white-doodled ones. After spotting her in the crowd, he even invited the fan onstage to ask about the blazer and how she had made it. The audience cheered so loudly at the sight that the woman’s answer was lost to the crowd’s volume. At another point, toward the end of the set, Simmons encouraged the audience to “get low” before jumping into the air as he sang one of the group’s unreleased songs.
While their music was new, Little Image’s overall energy and enthusiasm were contagious and familiar. The power and flair added to each part of this show opener indicate that the members of Little Image not only love to perform but also know how to put on a captivating show. If anything, this band brought out the magic of attending a live show. Improvised vocals, scratchy riffs, and flashy drumming topped off with mood-setting lighting and a slightly foggy atmosphere — in a small, intimate venue, Little Image managed to put on a big, brilliant opening show.

“Pi: 25th Anniversary Re-Release” probably should not exist. Without A24’s recent dominance of the independent film market and an offhand deal made by director Darren Aronofsky a quarter of a century ago, this remastered version of “Pi” would live only in the heads of the most die-hard cinephiles. Following “mad genius” Maximilian Cohen in his relentless search for mathematical patterns in the world around him, “Pi” was a mostly forgotten black sheep of the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.
That is, until Aronofsky’s most recent effort, “The Whale,” catapulted both himself and actor Brendan Fraser, who won “Best Actor” at the 2023 Oscars, into the Hollywood limelight. So, when the rights to “Pi” serendipitously reverted back to Aronofsky this year, it only made sense for A24, the production company behind “The Whale,” to re-release Aronofsky’s mathematics-obsessed debut on Pi Day at IMAX theaters across the country.
At AMC Assembly Row 12 in Boston, this led to a packed audience of pop culture fanatics. Before the screening, theatergoers mingled about all manner of hipster media, from David Foster Wallace’s 1996 mammoth novel “Infinite Jest” to the Wachowskis’ 2006 blockbuster “Speed Racer.”
Following a montage of saturated “Pi” still frames set to Clint Mansell’s electronica backing track, a large, red countdown timer abruptly flashed on the IMAX screen. After the timer hit zero, the TCL Chinese Theatres broadcast a live Q and A featuring Aronofsky, actor Sean Gullette, and various other members of the “Pi” cast and crew to theaters nationwide.
Aside from a few hiccups, including 89-year-old actor Stanley B. Herman forgetting how to use a microphone, the conversation was engaging and insightful. Aronofsky and his cohorts touched on the more complicated aspects of the film shoot, which required many locations that, to the young filmmakers, were only to be accessed through extralegal means.“We put on NYU sweaters and pretended we were film students,” producer Eric Watson commented.
After nearly 40 minutes of discussion, the panelists walked offstage to join a rapturous crowd. Mathematical figures and symbols exploded across the massive IMAX screen, overlaid by the names of the figures just seen in the live Q and A. Disorienting and labyrinthine, this opening sequence immediately sucks the audience into the vast and complicated mindscape of Max, the film’s eccentric protagonist.
Shot on cheap black-and-white reversal film stock, “Pi” begins with a shot of Max in high contrast. He wakes up, makes a trip to the bathroom, and takes a handful of prescription pills. Through the visual and nonvisual, Aronofsky highlights Max’s obsessiveness and paranoia. Before exiting his apartment, Max stares through his door’s peephole and unlatches lock after lock. Meanwhile, the narration relays a childhood trauma in which he stared at the sun too long and almost blinded himself. Every shot, action, and line of dialogue are meaningfully choreographed to convey Max’s inescapable neuroses.
At times heavy-handed, Aronofsky’s “Pi” does not shy away from the relationships between mythological, religious, mathematical, economic, and human concepts. Max is Icarus. The golden ratio exists in everything. Hebrew, the stock market, and God are all intertwined by one number. These “patterns,” as Max puts them, generally serve to elevate the film and its characters.
However, “Pi” sometimes feels like a young screenwriter trying to prove his worth to a panel of smug Sundance critics. Indeed, Aronofsky pokes fun at this in one of the best written sequences of the film, wherein Sol, Max’s mentor, gives advice through the lens of Archimedes of Syracuse. Max interprets Archimedes’s story as signaling, “A breakthrough will come.” But Sol reveals what it really means, “Listen to your wife.” This scene attests that allegories do not always beget profound, complex messages. Sometimes meaning lies right on the surface.
A review of “Pi” would be incomplete without commending the unconventional cinematography and sound design that contribute to the film’s indie charm. During the live Q and A, cinematographer Matthew Libatique revealed that the film would not look “nearly as cool” if he had fully known what he was doing. Lights and darks, interpreted by grainy black-and-white film stock, dominate the high contrast look of “Pi.” One scene might be blaring white, obscuring character features through harsh light, while another is shrouded in jet black, revealing only the most distinct aspects of a scene.
In an IMAX setting, this look is amplified. Beneath a 59 by 79 foot screen, a packed audience is fully subjected to the constant wax and wane of the film’s intense lighting. Add to this Mansell’s pulse-pounding score on JBL surround sound, and the audience is fully immersed in the deranged mindscape of Max.
Like “Pi,” Aronofsky’s later films revolve around addictive characters forced to confront their self-destructive vices. “Requiem for a Dream,” his sophomore feature, uses math as a tool to convey addiction (unlike “Pi,” which uses math as an addiction). The shots of “Requiem” are spliced in such a way that they become shorter and shorter, until reaching a fever pitch culminating in an extreme climax in which characters engage in harmful behavior.
What separates “Pi” from its offspring, however, is its imperfection. Without the big budget (e.g., “Noah”) or big actors (e.g., “Black Swan”) a young director could only dream for, Darren Aronofsky is boiled down to his rawest form. Like Max, Charlie, Nina, or any number of the director’s famed protagonists, “Pi” has its flaws. Yet, from these flaws bursts an offbeat and thought-provoking filmgoing experience, made all the better by top-of-the-line film restoration and IMAX technology.

In addition to his famous quip about “death and taxes” that seems to roam around the interwebs every year come mid-April, Benjamin Franklin’s whimsical monetary musings also extend to something else that strikes fear into all who hear it spoken of: debt.
Debt, arrears, a loan: whatever you might call it, the idea of owing another too much of something or for too long deeply troubled the polymath Founding Father, who warned his readers to “never keep borrow’d Money an Hour beyond the Time you promis’d” and that “The second Vice is Lying; the first is Running in Debt.”
Franklin, whose likeness hangs in terracotta form on the second floor of the Harvard Art Museum, would, in all probability, be fairly disturbed by modern attitudes toward debt — especially amidst what can only be described as an incredibly turbulent time for global financial systems given the recent banking turmoil both in the United States and abroad (looking at you, Credit Suisse). On an individual level, millions of Americans collectively hold almost $1 trillion in high-interest credit card debt, while multiple more trillions exist in the form of debt collateralized by the homes, vehicles, and other goods we deem essential for contemporary living. On a national level, the federal debt, now $31.4 trillion and counting, has long been a fractious target of political jockeying even though its intrinsic differences with household debt make it a relatively tamer concern.
Even so, there is no question that debt constitutes a core pillar of modern society. Some of our most mundane actions, from swiping a credit card to promising to Venmo a friend for lunch, ultimately involve the creation of credit and debit in some form.
But there is a key difference between the former and latter: Whereas refusing to pay off your Visa on time likely entails a not-so-pleasant letter in the mail or knock on the door, your friend will probably be fine if you need a couple more days to scrounge up $20. Moreover, while distant third parties such as credit card issuers charge a sizable interest rate for their lending services, your buddy presumably would not (if they do, consider re-evaluating your friendship).
The very concept of interest is, at its core, largely synonymous with the nature and strength of the relationship between a lender and borrower. While borrowing a lawnmower from your next-door neighbor is usually a no-interest affair, that is only the case because of mutual familiarity, geographical proximity, and the expectation of future reciprocity; you are essentially obligated to be the magnanimous supplier of garden equipment the next time around.
This explains why a rise in social complexity, at least initially, begets the emergence of the interest rate. As the average interpersonal distance increases between the debtor and debtee, expectations of reciprocity become increasingly unrealistic, not only because of spatial or temporal distance but also the growing difficulty to trust the word of a stranger.
It comes as no surprise, then, that written documentation of interest being paid is nearly as old as writing itself; though not currently displayed, this second millennium BCE Assyrian cuneiform tablet from the Harvard Art Museums collection dictates the addition of interest to a loan of silver shekels and is an excellent illustration of interest’s descent from antiquity.
Remarkably, impassioned rhetoric against the charging of interest appears in the historic record more or less at the same time. On a visit to the Renaissance gallery in the Harvard Art Museum during my recent financial musings, I noted a multitude of depictions of Saint Jerome — who, as it so handily turns out, was one of the fiercest detractors of “usura,” the Latin term he chose to express the multiple Biblical prohibitions of abusive lending practices and the etymological parent of “usury” in modern English.
Leviticus 25:35-37 spells out the antipathy toward interest in Scripture most precisely:“Take no interest from [your brother] or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.”
The belief encapsulated here that fellow brethren, particularly of the same faith, should not demand a fee for a loan or favor makes perfect sense if you see interest as something born fundamentally out of the exigencies of civilizations growing in both social complexity and distance. In essence, most “anti-usury” efforts, from the historic proclamations of religious teachers to the ongoing campaign in the United States to forgive billions of student loan debt, represents a nostalgic yearning for a time when fraternal trust was much more free-flowing.
And perhaps, it really would be a good idea to reconsider our shared attitudes toward debt and interest. After all, there is no better time than now: The tightening of interest rates by the Federal Reserve over the past year has largely driven the many bank runs and general economic chaos that we’ve come to witness as of late.
Is a society where entire livelihoods are built on debts of various shades, and where hikes in interest rates become points of collective obsession, truly in line with the congenial aspirations of mutual well-being and fortune that we share just as much? You be the judge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I started acting when I was eight. It was, in many ways, the defining moment of my life. I discovered something that I was deeply passionate about, which I’d dedicate a good deal of my life to. Acting was a tool for dealing with strong, percussive emotions, and for understanding myself and the world around me.
The prospect of being able to explore disciplines like Philosophy, Government, and History while still participating in the arts and growing as an artist attracted me to a liberal arts education. But when I arrived at Harvard, known for its exceptional opportunities in the liberal arts, I was shocked by the lack of attention paid to the ‘arts’ part of that curriculum.
In the study of what it means to be human, we’ve forgotten perhaps its most defining characteristic: the propensity for creativity. To receive a degree signifying completion of a liberal arts education at Harvard, students are never required to write a story, perform on stage, or pick up an instrument.
Students who do participate in the arts often confine their creative talents to extracurricular activities, which are largely viewed not as educational opportunities, but as outlets for those who are already proficient. Instead, all students should be required to take a creative arts class.
I know. It’s a tall ask. But I think it’s foundationally important.
Performance is highly personal, and affects your mind in a way meaningfully distinct from analysis. It’s a crucial tool to help understand both yourself and the art that you’re performing.
When I was in high school, I spent three weeks hastily memorizing, rehearsing, and performing “Hamlet.” It was all-consuming; I was thinking about the prince almost every minute of every day. That forced interrogation gave me a much deeper understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare’s words in a way that nothing else could ever have. Nothing makes you understand Hamlet’s emotional turmoil in his “To be, or not to be” monologue more than being dead tired running over the same tragic scenes over and over, forcing yourself to be visibly miserable, staining your clothes with sweat and tears.
More than that, performing gave me a deeper understanding of myself. It helped me understand my own struggles with depression and hopelessness. It forced me to interrogate parts of myself I would rather forget about: the parts of myself that found catharsis in Hamlet’s screaming and mentally ill ramblings. It gave me a deeper, more nuanced view of the complex world that I live in.
And that enveloping experience is not unique to me. It’s the same kind of experience my friend Veronica F. Leahy ’23 had while writing and performing her senior thesis, “American Tonic.” Her concert, in my view, was as much an anthropological project as a musical showcase, trying to document what it means to live with Type 1 diabetes. Seeped in the language of jazz, Leahy wrote music that was often harsh, uncomfortable, and angry, yet interlaced with joy and hope. Interspersed were interviews with figures such as activists, peers, and childhood friends. The performance seemed more than just an attempt to document, but an attempt to understand the disease that’s plagued her for most of her life. Writing and performing, for Leahy, helped her understand herself as much as it helped others understand the experience of living with chronic illness.
But art is often extremely difficult, reliant on years and years of experience. That’s one frequent criticism of requiring participation in the arts. Many students may feel as though they’re not suited to performance, and that a lack of innate ‘talent’ and the many years of dedicated practice required to improve would cause any art classes they take to hurt their GPA, stopping them from getting anything meaningful out of the experience.
These arguments are well taken. Art is difficult. But the goal of the liberal arts is to push you out of your comfort zone. This kind of education is supposed to be hard, and you should be exploring things you’ve never done and may never do again. It’s also supposed to force you to do things you may not intrinsically want to — that’s the whole point of the liberal arts. It’s what makes education special.
Harvard prides itself on liberal arts, but has let a key aspect of that mission slip through their fingers. The College, as part of their divisional distribution requirements, should separate the Arts and Humanities, forcing students to take at least one of each.
The new distributional Arts courses should be focused on creative writing, acting, musical composition, musical performance, physical art, and design, offering students a broad range of options given their areas of interest. This will allow students to be as invested as possible, and make it so every student is creating something in a field they find at least somewhat enjoyable. This gives them the autonomy to choose their own paths through the arts, while ensuring that they aren’t missing out on that foundational part of their education.
Creativity is a fundamental part of being, and a crucial tool in understanding art, self, and environment. It’s ridiculous that Harvard almost entirely ignores it. As Shakespeare wrote, “All the world’s a stage.” It’s about time we treated it like one.

At the opening of a Twitter clip, an American flag-patterned caduceus rises. Beside it reads the name of the organization that posted the Tweet, America’s Frontline Doctors. A kindly-looking doctor in a white medical jacket appears. “Hey freedom lovers. A team of nine scientists from Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and other top universities just published paradigm-shifting research looking at the safety and efficacy of the Covid ‘vaccines,’” he says, putting vaccines in air quotes.
The doctor launches into a summary of the draft paper, titled “COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters for Young Adults: A Risk-Benefit Assessment and Five Ethical Arguments against Mandates at Universities.” He focuses on one surprising fact in the paper’s findings: Based on a risk-benefit assessment of existing global data, it would take vaccinating an estimated 22,000 to 30,000 previously uninfected adults aged 18 to 29 to prevent the hospitalization of just one student with Covid-19.
The summary is interspersed with reaction clips, including one from the kids’ TV show Gravity Falls. The doctor concludes: “So in other words, the shots are completely worthless.”
In fact, a final version of the paper published this December in the Journal of Medical Ethics finds that the number of young adults that need to get vaccinated in order to prevent one hospitalization is closer to a range of 31,000 to 42,000. Contrary to the intentions of the authors, the data now serves as material for conservative medical organizations like AFLDS skeptical of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy.
The doctor in the video — Peterson Pierre, a cosmetic dermatologist — is a spokesperson for AFLDS. Like him, most of the organization’s doctors have never treated Covid-19 patients, yet AFLDS has promoted hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria medication, as a cure for Covid-19, despite warnings from the WHO and FDA that it is not preventative against the virus. As of March, the video about the research paper has reached over 18,000 views on Twitter with hundreds of likes and retweets.
To the vaccine experts who authored the paper, these groups are peripheral but flagrantly misrepresent legitimate inquiries into vaccine safety and efficacy.
Salmaan A. Keshavjee, a board-certified internist and the director of Harvard Medical School’s Center for Global Health Delivery, co-authored the paper in question. He rejects the video’s interpretation of his work.
“I am surprised by the fact that so many people, from what I’ve read on Twitter at least, read it to mean, ‘Don’t get vaccines,’” he says. “That’s a very selective reading of this data. I’m genuinely surprised.”
Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, Keshavjee published scientific research articles studying the global response as well as authored editorials in non-scientific media outlets. Although he advocates passionately for vaccination, Keshavjee says that many on Twitter considered his study “ammo to these people that are saying not to get vaccines.”
Rather, he and his colleagues had published the paper with the intention to respond to a gap in government accountability. “It is arguably negligent that key institutions such as the CDC and FDA have not conducted a risk-benefit assessment either before or after recommending that all adults should receive a booster dose,” they write in the paper, after analyzing data from integrated health systems in Israel, as well as from CDC trials.
Given the urgency of vaccine rollout during the global pandemic, the FDA granted additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine Emergency Use Authorization based on observational data rather than trial data. The paper claims that the CDC failed to update vaccine efficacy estimates to reflect the reality on the ground, since Americans already benefit from increasing natural immunity against the virus following infection, while the vaccine itself has become less effective as mutations arise.
However, the rapid mutation of the virus has led other medical researchers to question the efficacy of natural immunity, given that immunity inevitably wanes over time, often faster than inoculated immunity.
Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology and co-director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard’s School of Public Health, argues for the short-term value of receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. “It is not a permanently transmission-blocking vaccine,” he says. “But it does reduce the chances of getting infected and transmitting for a period of time after vaccination. And that’s not nothing.”
Keshavjee believes Hanage misses the point of the paper. “We have to remember that this is not an analysis of having a seasonal vaccine,” Keshavjee wrote in an email. “The paper looks at the cost-benefit for males between the ages of 18-29. In that particular group, mandates do not make sense because the risk of an adverse event may outweigh the benefit.”
The authors of the paper further claim that the CDC failed to analyze booster efficacy for those with comorbidities and a history of prior infection, as well as failed to conduct substantial risk-benefit assessments among children and adolescents.
They estimate that mass-vaccinating college-aged students with the booster dose may inadvertently cause many to experience side effects, yet prevent too few hospitalizations to make a mandate a worthwhile pursuit.
“The storyline is, ‘Are boosters equally effective in everybody?’ We should be answering that before we tell everyone to get it,” Keshavjee says. “And the corollary to equally effective is, ‘Are they equally safe in everybody?’”
Their paper asserts that university mandates may also harm young people that are hesitant to get vaccines. “Covid-19 booster mandates often involve a degree of coercion, including the threat of loss of access to education and free choice of occupation,” the researchers write.
Stephen M. Kissler, a postdoctoral research fellow at the School of Public Health’s Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, disagrees with the paper’s conclusions on a booster mandate in universities.
“There’s room for reasonable disagreement, but the evidence I’ve seen shows that mandating boosters for college students at this time of year is a good idea,” Kissler says, citing the benefits of immunizing college students in close contact.
“If you vaccinate in these months leading up to winter, you avoid transmission to university workers and staff members with higher risk of infection,” he says. “I don’t find any flaws with the analysis they conducted, except that it’s maybe a little too narrow in my mind in terms of what risks and benefits they consider.”
Keshavjee disagrees with this characterization of Covid-19 transmission in high-density environments, where the virus reproduces at a high rate. “Throughout the epidemic, COVID-19 has not demonstrated significant seasonality,” he wrote in an email. “And in situations of high density, one could imagine increased transmission. Unfortunately, in that setting the efficacy of a vaccine’s ability to stop transmission also goes down.”
The researchers still contend that university booster mandates are “highly problematic,” especially without a reliable method of recourse for vaccine-related injuries.
Without formal assessments of the risks and benefits of booster shots to young adults, the researchers argue, universities are creating vaccine policies based on insufficient data.
Keshavjee says that readily accessible medical information about the Covid-19 vaccines can reinforce public trust and equip people to engage with their own health decisions and protect their communities, rather than depend on mandates.
However, Kissler takes issue with the paper’s argument against booster mandates. “There is already so much evidence for the safety and efficacy of boosters, so it doesn’t seem like a strong basis for arguing against them being mandated,” he says, though he acknowledges the utility of researchers raising these questions for the public to grapple with.
Kevin Bardosh, a medical anthropologist and affiliate assistant professor at the University of Washington who is the lead author of the paper, claims that many media outlets have failed to meaningfully engage questions of vaccine mandate efficacy, which has exacerbated polarization to the extent that some Americans refuse to be vaccinated at all.
“Scientific institutions have shot themselves in the foot,” Bardosh says.
“Anti-vaccine organizations like AFLDS wield influence because they speak to Americans’ distrust not only in scientific institutions, but also in pharmaceutical companies,” Keshavjee says. “There is an ethical dilemma,” he says. “Is this driven by science? Or is this a desire for profit?”
Yet, Hanage believes that AFLDS discourages people from following the science. “Their messaging is scientifically unsupported. It flies in the face of our efforts to protect people, and to continuously get better at protecting people, by telling them things which are not supported by what we know now, and by sowing doubt, and by encouraging folks to do their own research, which means looking for blog posts, as opposed to having a serious conversation with their doctor about what is best for them.”
Peterson Pierre, the cosmetic dermatologist from the AFLDS Twitter clip, believes that he seeks the truth that other doctors omit. “The problem is this: authors want to publish scientific studies because it’s their job to do so but they also need to stick to the narrative because they want to keep their jobs,” he said in an emailed statement. “I don’t have those restrictions. I don’t play political games, and I don’t care what the narrative is, especially if it’s deceptive and harmful.”
“I am here to uphold the truth and do what is right and I have no conflict of interest. I have a clear conscience,” he added.
As for university booster mandates, Bardosh argues that a handful of American institutions are making impactful decisions for students’ lives based on a misinterpretation of scientific evidence.
“They have been much too quick to disregard the bodily autonomy and decision-making of their students. They have been much too quick to overstate the benefits of boosters and underplay their risks,” he wrote in an email. “Mandates are addictive. They create a culture of enforcement and coercion. They are hard to stop. But evidence does not support them.”
Hanage believes both the scientists and anti-vaccine groups bear the blame. “It is not clear to me what is a greater source of any such erosion: mandates themselves, or the noise that comes from people including scientists or doctors drawing attention to the mandates and complaining about them,” Hanage wrote in an email.

UPDATED: March 29, 2023 at 4:40 p.m.
Rebecca Hall does not consider herself a scholar. At least, not in the traditional sense. As a Ph.D. student, she traveled around the world researching the untold stories of women-led slave revolts in the United States, completing research that would transform the way she viewed the history of this country and herself. But by the time her dissertation was completed, only a few people actually read it. “It’s just sort of buried in academia,” Hall says. “How can I get this information that I think is important out in the world in a way that retains its complexity, but not dumbing it down?”
From inside her office in Byerly Hall as a visiting fellow of the Radcliffe Institute — surrounded by walls that have now become a living, breathing outline of her next narrative – Hall reveals the answer.
“Comics,” she says. “That’s not a normal thought process, but it is for me, because I love the medium. Comics are a medium.”
In 2021, Hall — who has no formal training as an artist — published “Wake: The Hidden History of Women-Led Slave Revolts,” a graphic novel. Since then, “Wake” has been listed as a best book of the year by Forbes, Ms., NPR, and the Washington Post. Hall then told the ‘story behind the story’ in an audio drama adaptation of the graphic novel, which was recently nominated for Audiobook of the Year at the 2023 Audie Awards.
In “Wake,” Hall is the protagonist, serving as the narrator and guide through the story. Readers follow her as she sifts through archival records, reckons with the truth that begins to haunt her, and goes on a nature walk for a moment of respite from the atrocities that she uncovers.
Hall feels there is something special about the visual organization of comics that allows people to connect with stories in unique ways. “If you want to see every frame of something, you go to a movie, right? With a comic, the reader is a participant,” Hall says.
It is raw, personal, and therefore, exactly what many traditional academics would advise against. But to Hall, that is the point of telling Black women’s stories as a Black woman. “I don’t believe in objectivity. I feel like the most responsible position is to say: ‘All knowledge is situated. And so here’s how I am situated,’” Hall says.
As the granddaughter of people who lived as slaves on plantations in Missouri and Tennessee, Hall believes her proximity to the history of American chattel slavery placed her on a path of constantly pursuing justice.
Before becoming a historian, Hall received a law degree from University of California, Berkeley in 1989. An early comic strip in “Wake” describes her feeling of entrapment in a racist and misogynistic legal system for tenant’s rights: “I could ‘win’ these cases for my clients. But I felt the need to see underneath the ‘justice system’ — to get at the root of what was warping the world.”
So Hall went back to school. This time, she received a Ph.D. in history from UC Santa Cruz. Still craving an opportunity to communicate her discoveries to a wider audience, Hall started teaching at universities. But after what she described as a “nightmare situation,” she left academia for good, frustrated that academic writing lacked potential to creatively engage those outside of its inner circles. “Scholarly writing is the death of writing,” Hall says.
Disillusioned by academia but still wanting to teach, Hall switched career paths yet again. This time, she began teaching at a local public high school in Salt Lake City. After being denied a full-time history position for critiquing a lesson plan that involved buying and selling human chattel as a math problem, Hall was hired and fired two more times.
Seeking a way to illuminate structural problems with her research, Hall turned to comics.
She took a deep dive into how comic books worked — pouring over pages of colorfully bookmarked instructional comic book guides that now sat on her office bookshelf. Finally, Hall was ready to bring her ideas to life. A mutual friend introduced her to Hugo Martínez, an illustrator who at the time worked full-time as a pedicab driver in New Orleans. In May 2018, they began working on the graphic novel with around $9,000, crowdfunded on the website Kickstarter.
But as Hall began her research, she found that the women whose stories she told would suddenly disappear from the archives. When Hall ran into this problem, she turned to “critical fabulation,” a methodology coined by academic Sadiya Hartman in 2008. Hall describes this process as the “measured use of historical imagination.” “The record has fallen completely silent. How can I continue to tell the story? I can tell it based on some stuff that actually, positively 100% could have happened,” Hall says.
Hall explains that many institutional archives contain scant information on marginalized groups. Hall not only sought to fill in these gaps but reimagine the way people regard this history entirely.
“Some of what makes these stories buried is in the banality of evil,” Hall says. “The way the history of slave resistance has been written by historiography in the United States is that there was no resistance to slavery here because slavery was a benign and civilizing institution.”
After going on her book tour, Hall began to see firsthand how this work of truth-telling was impacting more people than she could have ever imagined. One moment stands out in her mind from a visit to a book club for high school students hosted by Tulane University.
“There was this 10th grader that was like, ‘Comics are usually about superheroes. So who’s the superhero in your book?’” Hall recalls fondly. “I’m like, ‘Black people,’ then the whole room started applauding. And you know teens don’t applaud.”
Later, she shows me TikToks of people reviewing her book and sheds a few happy tears. She bustles around her office, finding the paperback translations of “Wake” with colorful covers in French, German, Turkish, and Japanese.
Through it all, Hall remains in a state of disbelief at just how much her book resonated with people across the world. “This was a really weird project. I thought it was very niche and very personal. So I’m still trying to wrap my brain around why it popped in the way it did,” Hall says.
After her book tour, Hall decided on a whim to give academia another try, and applied for a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute. She was accepted as a Mary Beth and Chris Gordon Fellow for the 2022-23 academic year.
“It’s like I’ve needed this my whole life and didn’t know,” Hall says.
Hall is currently working on a new graphic narrative called “Taking Freedom,” based on the resistance of Black women during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. “I think it’s important for people to understand why people need to engage with this time period,” Hall says. “So much of our country has been shaped by what happened.”
Hall is also developing her own production company rooted in Afro-futurist education, called Wake Productions. Hall hopes to incorporate various media beyond comics — including film and podcasts. With all of her projects, Hall tries to stay rooted in core values of truth, justice, and education.
“Nobody likes being lied to. Everyone wants to know the information that helps them understand their world,” Hall says. “I am really drawn to connecting all these people who don't want to be lied to anymore, and teaching outside of the entire classroom.”
Correction: March 29, 2023
A previous version of this article stated that in an early comic strip in “Wake,” Rebecca Hall described her "feeling of entrapment in a racist and misogynistic criminal justice system." In fact, she worked as a tenant's rights attorney, not in the criminal justice system.

For one night each semester, one of Harvard’s most famous courses, Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” throws a school-sanctioned all-nighter: the Hackathon. From 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., students stay up at the Science and Engineering Complex working on their final projects, fueled by Felipe’s burritos, Otto’s pizza, and absurd quantities of candy and coffee.
“Those still awake at 5 a.m. will be treated to breakfast at IHOP,” the CS50 website advertises. The event is presented as a fun and memorable way for students to collaborate on their work, and for many participants, that remains true. Hustling into different rooms in the Science and Engineering Complex, students group together to work on their code. Apparently, nothing exhilarates prospective computer science students quite like sugar, caffeine, music, and the sleep-deprived adrenaline of solving bugs and errors at the crack of dawn.
Meanwhile, for the undergraduate course assistants of the class, the Hackathon feels like a long, unpaid ordeal.
This year in particular, the undergraduate teaching staff of CS50 has raised concerns about the burden of work placed on them. Course assistants mainly hold office hours and small tutorials; enhanced CAs additionally lead sections and grade most assignments.
Under CS50’s fall 2022 contract, enhanced CAs may receive compensation for up to 10 hours of work per week, a reduction from the 12-hour maximum of previous years. Meanwhile, CAs may receive compensation for a maximum of only five hours of work per week.
“I think five hours for CAs is really unfair to them,” says Jacob J. Fernandes ’24, who has worked as a CA and an enhanced CA for CS50, citing the Hackathon as one source of unfairly compensated work.
Though CS50 is just one course among thousands, the class reflects wider labor issues at Harvard. Throughout the University, teaching fellows and CAs have mobilized in the past decade for better pay, benefits, and working conditions.
Graduate students began organizing in 2015 and successfully registered their union in 2018. Since then, they have gone on strike twice. Just this past year, undergraduates workers followed suit and began organizing their own workers union.
Despite what Harvard would lead students to believe, much of its undergraduate education relies on its hundreds of CAs and TFs. This is especially the case in large introductory courses like CS 50, Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability,” Life Sciences 1A: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology,” and Life Sciences 1B: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution” which typically have one faculty member leading a lecture with hundreds of students. And while Harvard does mention its teaching fellows on the admissions website, nowhere does it reference the countless CAs who are responsible for the education of thousands of students in large STEM classes.
The experiences of CAs and TFs alike — in CS50 and beyond — have shed light on a number of teaching-related issues at the University: low wages, inadequate training for teaching staff, and inaccessible faculty. The question is, do these factors pose a barrier to the high quality of instruction that Harvard advertises? And if it does, is the Harvard paradigm evidence of a growing devaluation of higher education at large?
“POV: You’re a Harvard student taking an intro Computer Science course,” reads the caption of a video on CS50’s YouTube channel as “Heat Waves” by Glass Animals plays in the background. The camera pans over a packed Sanders Theatre where professor David J. Malan ’07 lectures from a podium onstage.
Midway through, the video cuts to a student at home watching the same lecture from their desk. CS50 is available free for anyone to take online, the video explains.
With a YouTube channel of 1.38 million subscribers and an Instagram following of over 160,000, CS50 has become far more than an introductory computer science course. So what makes the experience of the students enrolled in the class at Harvard different from the experience of the over four million people who have taken the course online?
The answer, says Fernandes, is that enhanced CAs, whom students and teaching staff in CS50 refer to as TFs, are “essentially running the course.”
“Malan gets to go on stage and he creates these great lectures, but in the end, students are coming to the TFs for pretty much everything else,” Fernandes says.
Professor Malan did not respond to a request for comment.
While some of the expectations set on the undergraduate teaching staff are typical — such as leading office hours and small tutorials, as well as attending weekly staff meetings — other expectations go beyond the typical workload for CAs — including staying long after class to answer questions as well as leading and preparing materials for large sections.
Fernandes lists the time commitments for each of these responsibilities. “That leaves only three hours for grading,” he says. “If you’ve ever graded, you know that it does not take just three hours to grade p-sets, especially for CS.”
In addition to these duties and staffing Hackathon, CAs are expected to attend the CS50 fair, where students present their final projects for the course.
Connor J. Leggett ’23, the head TF for CS50, explains that while the responsibilities of CAs and TFs are laid out before they sign their contracts, undergraduate teaching staff are often unclear on what those responsibilities will actually look like. For example, some of CS50’s large events fall during midterms and finals, when CAs may find themselves overwhelmed with their own work.
“When people agree to these things, they don’t know the dates,” Leggett says. “So when people agreed to the CS50 fair, they didn’t know that it might be the day before their 121 or 120 finals,” referring to the upper-level computer science courses.
The most recent contract for CS50 CAs only allows them to report a maximum of 10 hours. This contract does not fairly compensate undergraduates considering the amount of time they spend staffing CS50’s large events and grading tests at the end of the year, Fernandes says.
“I think 12 hours is totally fine — I was totally happy last year with 12 hours,” Fernandes says. “But this year when we were told we only get 10 hours, it’s very frustrating as a TF because we were doing a lot of work for the class.”
Alyssa Huang ’24, who worked as a CS50 TF for two semesters, says the course provides a wealth of resources for teaching. “There was a pretty robust TF’ing system – they had solutions, they had section notes that were pre-prepared for us, and very clear grading guidelines,” she says.
Support for TFs and CAs includes one to two days of training prior to the semester, weekly staff meetings, and a mentorship program, where more experienced TFs meet with a small group of first-time course assistants. According to Leggett, this provides a space for troubleshooting and reflection.
As he puts it, the course is “a well-oiled machine.”
However, Fernandes says preparing for sections and reviewing students’ questions on a “24/7” basis through the course’s online blog adds on still more work, despite TFs’ limited paid hours.
Moreover, Fernandes believes that CS50’s hierarchical structure has made the course “impersonal.” Malan does not list his own office hours on the CS50 website, so it is difficult for a student to meet with him.
“I’ve taken other classes at Harvard that are really big, and the TFs run them largely, but the instructors always still have office hours, where you can meet with the instructor if you need help,” Fernandes says.
Though undergraduate instructors play a vital role in large courses like CS50, they are objectively inexperienced educators when compared to the renowned professors that Harvard touts to prospective students. While some CAs and TFs are passionate and dedicated teachers, others fall short. The quality of one’s education at Harvard is then determined by whose section they’re placed into.
Halfway through the fall semester, Koby Ljunggren, a Ph.D. candidate in Biophysics and graduate head TF for Life Sciences 1A and 1B, was suddenly called in to take over another section. There, Ljunggren met students with accommodations who felt their needs were not met by their previous instructor.
LS1A and 1B are large lecture courses that count toward the pre-med track, which are taken by hundreds of freshmen each year. Given the class size, section becomes students’ main opportunity to ask questions and clarify concepts from lectures.
“I’m neurodivergent myself, and so I end up working with a lot of neurodivergent students whose learning styles don’t match up with their TF’s expectations,” they say.
“The first or second time I taught them, we had a real cathartic moment,” Ljunggren adds. where they were like, ‘I’m so glad that someone’s in the classroom now that really cares about my learning.’”
That evening, the students stayed with Ljunggren long after their section had ended, sharing their experiences with classroom accommodations.
“It was sort of that big sigh of relief that I’ve never seen a student have — that even though the course is hard, someone is in the room now that wants to support them and is willing to advocate for them at the course staff level,” Ljunggren says. “And also someone that doesn’t just read off a slide.”
According to Ljunggren, low-quality teaching can affect students’ academic path in college, as well as their enthusiasm for specific future careers.
“These students will quite literally not want to continue pursuing this kind of field, which is really disappointing because we get a lot of different kinds of people in LS1A and 1B, including humanities and social sciences folks,” they say. “It makes me really sad because I want to make sure that students come out of my class being really passionate and gravitating toward this field rather than being pushed away from it.”
Maame A. Forson ’25, for one, decided not to pursue the pre-med track after taking large introductory STEM courses, where she says she felt lost and unsupported.
“I am mad at it because it shouldn’t be that way where there’s very little support in big classes,” she says. “It’s literally weeded out me. I’m not pre-med anymore. That’s the whole point of these big intro classes.”
As a neurodivergent student, Forson has found drastic disparities in the quality of support she receives from teaching staff. At the beginning of the semester, she reached out to her TF to let them know that she is autistic and discuss accommodations. Instead of discreetly providing her support, the TF routinely called her out in class, creating an uncomfortable learning environment, she says.
“The first couple of classes, she always singled me out. Like, she would yell my name. It wasn’t a big section — maybe 15 people — but she would yell, ‘Maame, do you understand?’” she says. “Everyone’s now looking at me like, ‘Oh, why is she constantly asking you,’ because now I feel othered.”
Forson believes the negative experiences she’s had often stem from a lack of training for teaching staff on neurodiversity in students.
“If the faculty had more awareness of what neurodiversity is, and how many different ways it can show up in people, it will probably make a lot of students’ experiences on campus better,” she says. “We have to go through staff that just has no clue about us, and it makes our interactions really uncomfortable.”
Ljunggren notes that they have received no training on working with neurodiverse students and haven’t heard of any such training existing in other departments. As a neurodiverse student themself, they are able to use their own experience to help students; however, without training, many staff members inevitably lack the same understanding, they say.
“While I know how to navigate that, because of my own experiences, staff who don’t have that experience are going to think differently. So yeah, I’m sure [training is] out there. It’s definitely not required. It is definitely not advertised well enough,” Ljunggren says.
Karla Aguilar ’25 also felt she lacked the necessary support when she was taking Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology,” an introductory life sciences course intended for students with limited experience with biology and chemistry. The class aims to provide significant assistance to its students, but Aguilar found her section leader largely unhelpful and was left to learn on her own.
She says that her TF did not distill complicated concepts into terms students could understand, instead asking them to memorize or simply accept what they were told in section without further context.
“I just remember there were moments where people would ask questions trying to actually understand the concepts,” she says. “We’re doing biology and chemistry, so students were like, ‘Okay, but why does that chemical bonding work in that way? Why does that happen?’ And he would just be like, ‘That’s just what they said in lecture,’ or, ‘It just does, you just have to memorize it.’”
Aguilar adds that while her TF seemed very knowledgeable about the subject material, this didn’t translate into strong instruction.
“Something I think happens often here is that they conflate interest in a subject with ability to teach,” she says, “He understood the material himself and was clearly very advanced. But I think that served as a detriment sometimes because he didn’t really know how to simplify it for us.”
“I don’t know if he was really interested in teaching,” Aguilar says.
On Harvard’s admissions website, the College touts its “world-class educators.”
“Working side by side with students, Harvard professors encourage them to see with new eyes,” it reads. But over the years, students have criticized the student-professor relationship at Harvard for being closer to an expert lecturing to an audience from a podium. Those actually working side by side with students, particularly in lecture courses, tend to be TFs and CAs. While students may have “immediate access to some of the world’s greatest scholars,” taking advantage of that access is far more difficult than it may seem.
While Saint R. Browder ’25 has been able to form strong relationships with their TFs, they can’t say the same for their professors. They don’t interact with professors in their regular academic life, and it’s difficult to find the time in their busy schedule to attend office hours and really get to know a professor.
“I’ve loved my professors, I haven’t had problems with them,” they add. “But it would be nice to be able to get closer to professors.”
Forson echoes Browder’s experience, saying that professors of huge lecture classes, such as her life sciences professor who teaches over 400 students, often feel unapproachable.
“He’s just standing there talking to a mass of students, and he doesn’t know any of us individually. It makes it hard for me to go up and talk to him as though he does,” says Forson.
This experience differs dramatically from the seven-to-one student-to-faculty ratio and a 12-person median class size advertised by the College. These statistics conceal the experience of the majority of Harvard students who find themselves, at several points in their college education, in lecture classes with hundreds of other students who will never meet their professors.
Kyle E. Waldman, a fourth-year graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in Sociology says that faculty “don’t get to have sustaining interactions with students” unless the course is small or students are outgoing enough to reach out to professors themselves. In comparison to smaller schools, Waldman says that Harvard students “get the short end of the stick” when it comes to instruction.
The instructors that students gravitate toward when they can’t go to their professors are often TFs or CAs.
Charles X. Hua ’23, who worked as a TF multiple times for Statistics 110, says his interest in helping teach the course began with his experience taking the class freshman year, where he was taught by a CA himself. “I really loved the class, learned a lot, and it ultimately confirmed my decision to concentrate in Statistics,” Hua says.
Another student, Shuheng A. Zhang ’25, recalls taking Math 1b in his first year with a TF that changed his perspective on the field. “I was really inspired by his teaching because he made things crystal clear,” Zhang remembers. “I was like, ‘Wow, these people really helped me get better at math and appreciate the field more.’” Zhang later became a CA in the Math Department himself.
Still, for some CAs, the awkwardness of teaching peers their own age still remains present, at least at the beginning.
“It’s definitely really weird at first. My first year teaching, when I was a sophomore, at 19 years old, there was a law school student in my section, and juniors and seniors in my section,” Leggett, the head CS50 TF, says. “At first I was definitely worried I’d be asked questions that I didn’t know the answer to.”
Leggett notes that the material he knew remained a fraction of the knowledge a professor, or even graduate student, would hold.
“I think a lot of people are used to a teacher-student relationship where the teacher is expected to be an older person and know more about everything than the student,” Leggett says. “But I think the TF-student relationship is supposed to be different, where the TF just knows a little bit more about this one specific subject and can help students out with that,” Leggett says, referring to undergraduate TFs, or enhanced CAs.
While this is not inherently detrimental to students’ education, without regular access to someone with more expertise, students can receive contradictory or downright incorrect information from their student instructors.
Parita M. Shah ’24, an undergraduate TF herself, concedes that undergraduate instructors don’t always have adequate expertise to answer students’ questions.
“I’ve had experiences where TFs have been very confidently answering questions, or said things to me that I was like, ‘Oh, this must be true.’ And then later, I found out from another TF that that was inaccurate, or false, which is a little bit frustrating,” Shah says.
“When you’re confused or struggling, and you go to office hours and the primary instruction you're getting is from fellow undergrads, sometimes they can also be misled or have inaccurate information that is now your primary source for information,” she adds.
According to Aguilar, this lack of adequate teaching is part of a broader pattern across the University that forces students to learn independently.
“A lot of the learning that happens at Harvard feels like it’s very independent and pretty student-driven,” she says. “We take lectures and, in a lot of ways, have to learn how to teach it to ourselves,” she says.
Though some students laud the relationships they form with their CAs and TFs, the undergraduate instruction they receive is inherently different from learning closely with an expert in the field. Harvard is full of those experts — but some claim that professors prioritize their research more than their teaching.
Waldman, a graduate student TF, says that Harvard is “not really a teaching university.”
“There is a pretty big gulf between the University and the College,” he says. “It’s very focused on graduate education.”
Browder, a student at the College, echoes Waldman’s claims.
“This is more of a research college than it is an actual learning college, which makes it difficult for someone who’s not in research right now to navigate my college experience,” they say. “I feel like I’m not getting the most out of it that I wanted to.”
As far back as 1980, Peter M. Engel ’81 wrote a Crimson op-ed claiming that the University's preference toward faculty who conduct research alongside their teaching deemphasized instruction, giving graduate student TFs who sought appointment in the tenured track “little incentive” to devote effort to their teaching.
“The atmosphere of ‘publish or perish’ is perpetuated through the ranks,” Engel wrote.
Seven years later, Gary D. Rowe ’88 called the college’s teaching structure a “scandal” in another Crimson op-ed.
“Each semester undergraduates who come to Harvard expecting to be taught by some of the finest minds around put their educations in the hands of an assortment of talented and less-than-talented graduate students,” he wrote. “The quality of one’s education here is, as a result, randomly determined.”
Today, opportunities for graduate students passionate about teaching are increasingly scarce, entrenching the problems that Rowe and Engel identified over three decades ago.
Similarly to Engel, Ljunggren believes that TFs have “no incentive” to continue teaching.
“We have these teaching requirements, but there’s no incentive in the academic system to then continue teaching or be passionate about it, because there aren’t even really careers that pay you living wages,” Ljunggren says.
Through his research, Jordan Harper, a Ph.D. candidate in urban education policy at the University of Southern California, has noticed that as faculty workloads increase, professors offload much of their relationship-building responsibilities onto teaching assistants.
“The traditional faculty member is able to skirt responsibility and the care labor that the teaching fellows or teaching assistants or whatever they may be are doing,” Harper says. “[Teaching assistants] are shouldering a lot of the responsibility to build relationships with students — teaching assistants are often that little middleman between students and the faculty member because the faculty member wants to safeguard their time and their energy.”
Though faculty members save time, undergraduate and graduate instructors find themselves burdened by the tasks added to their plate without additional compensation, Harper says.
“They’re arriving at work, and they’re having to do so much more work than ever before,” he says. “Yet, they’re menially paid. They’re undervalued, underappreciated, but highly utilized.”
Harper claims that this lack of investment in quality teaching creates a dissonance between a university’s supposed values and its actions.
“It’s a really interesting juxtaposition and contradiction,” he says. “A lot of institutions are purporting to care about student success. They’re trying to care about equity, for example, but they’re not necessarily creating the conditions for [teaching] assistants to thrive and have everything they need to not only be successful, but to live somewhat fulfilling lives.”
This pattern in undergraduate education may reflect a broader national trend of devaluing teaching careers even at the K-12 level, according to Ljunggren.
“We always talked about ‘all teachers are superheroes’ and ‘teachers are training the next generation.’ But if that’s really true, then you have to actually invest in that,” they say.
As the world’s wealthiest university, Harvard appears better positioned than any other institution to make that investment. Yet the University stands accused of overburdening its undergraduate and graduate teaching staff without adequate compensation or benefits. This pattern, though, is not unique to Harvard.
“Almost every day, at minimum every week, we are seeing graduate students unionize at a lot of different campuses across the country,” Harper says. “And one of the key things that they are organizing for is better working conditions, especially when it comes to teaching because they are doing so much of the work.”
But those facing the negative effects of these labor issues include students themselves.
At Harvard, students say they do not always receive the “world-class” education that the university promises them as applicants. Some find themselves in sections led by dispassionate graduate students. Others are taught by students their own age, whose knowledge varies greatly from that of the faculty whom they anticipated working with. According to students on both sides of the classroom, Harvard’s quality of education is largely determined by working conditions for both graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants.
In Ljunggren’s view, students and teaching staff alike will benefit from unionization efforts. Graduate and undergraduate instructors are continuing to advocate for higher pay, increased benefits and protections, and greater transparency from the University. But in the meantime, the quality of Harvard’s coveted education hangs in the balance.
According to Ljunggren, most TFs want to be good educators. But in order to do their jobs well, they need institutional support.
“We want to do our jobs better, and we want to be comfortable,” Ljunggren says. “And I think students see that when we are treated more fairly we are more relaxed, and we’re not so on edge, and we can spend more of our time and brainpower in helping you all become full-fledged learners.”

I kept peering down the river, hoping that at some bend in the trail, I would see the red dome of Dunster House poking out from above the treeline. With the Charles River to my left side, I knew that regardless of how lost I was, I could follow the water back home —
Home? At what point had the humble white walls and twin XL bed become home? It was only one month ago that I had moved into the 18th-century rectangular prism known as Massachusetts Hall. I could remember the details of move-in day — the faces, the weather, the goodbyes — to a degree that now has faded into a speck of emotional parting.
After my parents left, I remember sitting on my freshly wiped-down chair, staring at the window on the other side of the room, a slight August breeze circulating the Clorox-infused air. I remember feeling like a snail robbed of its shell, bare and exposed to the whims of social anxiety. Yet some miracle of adrenaline carried me through those first few days.
Roaming around the square with strangers past the wee hours of the night, hiking miles in the Appalachians on the First-Year Outdoor Program, only adrenaline drove me forward. In the beginning, I felt that I had entered a new world, the past 18 years and shelter of a familiar life thrown away. I was drifting through the start of college faster than I could catch how it was shaping me.
In an effort to root myself, to find security in my new surroundings, I returned to a familiar form of meditation: running. Running has always been my break from the bubbles that trap me in the other 23 hours of the day.
On this day, I found myself determined to run alone. Perhaps my desire for security led me to feel more confident, perhaps the adrenaline made me rash, but I also decided I would do so without my phone. At home, I always ran without my phone. I liked to hear my footsteps on the gravel, a rhythm just as calming as listening to my heartbeat, a testament to my body’s strength, yet also its fragile intricacy.
***
And so, as the temperature cooled with the setting sun, past Winthrop’s gate, I turned right. I took a route that I had taken with the running club just twice before. As the cars rolled by on the adjacent road, I remember taking notice of the geese on the path that honked — but never moved, even as bikes zoomed by.
For the first time in a long time — since move-in day, since staring at the peaks of the White Mountains on FOP — I found myself appreciating the world outside of the internal trance I had fallen into with orientation, Annenberg’s conversation roulette, and the start of college classes.
I passed bridge after bridge, until I came upon the one that I needed to cross — this turn I maneuvered correctly. Yet across the bridge, I found an intersection for which my memory had no direction to guide me. I took a right. Now, I recognize how perhaps a little logic would have led me in the direction back to campus: A mental map of a U turned on its side would have told me to turn left.
Still, I ran for about 10 minutes in the wrong direction. Yes, I realized that something was off when the landmarks I remembered never reappeared. But emboldened by my false confidence, my self-assured security in this new environment, I remained convinced that Harvard’s brick buildings would appear at some point — as if I could will them into existence.
Then I passed by the athletic fields of a different university and a boathouse completely foreign to me. I realized that I was lost. No one was there to help me. I couldn’t rely on my friends to know the area. I couldn’t rely on the knowledge my parents had imparted to me about my local home roads. I was alone.
I realized, in what felt like the middle of nowhere, on this expedition to prove to myself that I could find security in my new environment, that I was alone in being responsible for myself, in staying safe, for waking up at the right time, for making time for meals, for taking care of my mental health.
I yearned so deeply, facing a completely foreign stretch of the river, for any familiarity. I yearned to be back in the Yard that I had first seen just weeks ago. Though they were still not much more familiar than the streets of Watertown, the centuries-old brick structures provided me with warmth. The Yard had become a hearth I could return to in this entirely new city, amid an entirely foreign experience. It had become my place of rest in the exhausting adventure of navigating freshman fall.
In this fluster to return back to campus, my dorm appeared to me as the shell I was missing, something I longed to crawl into.
***
The sky had descended into darker shades of pink and purple. I retraced my recent steps, finding that intersection once again. Eventually, I found a couple, who I assumed were locals on their pre-dinner bike excursion, and asked for help. I felt at that moment like an elementary school child, asking for directions back home.
It reminded me of my first-grade teacher, who made us all memorize our house addresses and parents’ phone numbers in case we were in an emergency. I never needed to ask for directions home in my suburban childhood. Yet here, as a college student, I found myself facing an unknown world, more reflective of the life ahead of me. The fear that I would never see my dorm room again, that I would never befriend the strangers I had started to spend time with, made me promise to myself that I needed to take better care of myself.
Following the flow of the river back to campus, as I became once again familiar with the paths leading me back and I saw the tower of Memorial Hall in the distance, I could return to meditating to the sound of gravel.
The comfort of seeing campus softened my anxiety to understand this new world. In seeing this place as a new home, I realized I could take all the time I needed to slowly unravel the unfamiliar. It wasn’t like I would be going anywhere anytime soon.
This would also not be the last time I would be lost in this new place. Yet, knowing that I could make it back — even if it required asking for the help of some strangers along the way — I still felt equipped with the energy to explore some unfamiliar paths, to make wrong turns at forks along the way, but find a route back to safety, if needed. All these experiences could be a part of the process of finding my shell and refining the home I will construct for myself here.

Across rows of floor-to-ceiling shelves in the basement room of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, mason jars labeled with scraps of paper are filled to the brim with silver, finger-sized fish.
“We have about a million and a half individual fish specimens,” Andrew D. Williston, a collection manager at the MCZ, says. He specializes in ichthyology, the branch of zoology that studies fish. “It’s going to be much higher after we count all the sticklebacks.”
After the museum processes its newest donation, the collection will include half a million skeletons of three-spined stickleback fish alone.
Now, the Harvard Ichthyology collection at the MCZ is in the middle of a year-long process to curate and catalog these fish that, once completed, will help inform ichthyology and evolutionary research at large.
Three-spined stickleback fish have long fascinated researchers because of their ability to rapidly adapt to new environments.
The species initially inhabited oceans in the northern hemisphere and developed heavy scales as protection from predators. As the Ice Age ended, glaciers retreated, and freshwater lakes emerged. Small populations of stickleback “invaded” these ponds, according to Williston. As time went on, different populations adapted to their environmental niche and developed unique characteristics. Some freshwater sticklebacks, for example, completely lack body armor.
Each of the ponds is “its own little evolutionary experiment,” Williston says.
In the late 1980s, former Clark University biology professors John A. Baker and Susan A. Foster, a husband-wife duo, set out to investigate each of these natural experiments. They spent 30 years sampling water and tracking fish in over 90 freshwater lakes across Alaska and taking meticulous notes.
Sticklebacks, it turns out, can adapt to changing environments with lightning speed. The fish can evolve from oceanic to freshwater environments in mere decades, much faster than Charles Darwin’s model of gradual evolution predicts.
This makes sticklebacks prime research subjects. The data collected by the Baker & Foster Lab would come to inform over 70 published scientific papers. For the lay audience, they also ran a “Stickleblog” starting in 2008.
With Foster’s death and Baker’s deteriorating health, their collection needed to relocate, and the most logical choice was the Harvard MCZ, which was less than an hour drive away.
“My personal highlight was meeting John Baker, and getting to see his passion for these fish,” Williston says. Baker passed away in June 2021, just weeks before the specimens left for their new home in the MCZ.
A moving company transported well over 2,000 mason jars, each filled with 50 to 300 sticklebacks, and new shelves were built to house the half million new specimens.
And this was only the beginning. Currently, curators are manually transferring the specimens from Baker’s and Foster’s decade-old jelly jars filled with formaldehyde to new, labeled jars filled with ethanol solution. This process will take at least another year; not a single skeleton of the half million will be discarded.
Anne W. Everly, a lab manager at MCZ, has been doing much of this manual labor and finds it a fulfilling experience. “Every aspect of what we do, I’ve gotten to do with these fish,” she says. “The only thing I missed out on, of course, was the collecting — which is probably the best part.”
Once the curation is complete, Williston says, they will digitize the specimens. He hopes that the MCZ’s online database will become a central resource for researchers across the country who are investigating sticklebacks.
“Anybody in the world who has an interest in three-spined sticklebacks can log into our catalog and see where our specimens came from and if we have material that they need for their studies,” Williston says.
“There’s a whole community of researchers who focus on three-spined sticklebacks,” he adds. “I hope that we, as a collection, can connect with those researchers more and develop more interest in these specimens.”

What does it mean to be a people person? You would be wise to turn to Michael A. Grant, a Harvard Leverett House guard, for guidance. Mike, who has held his post since 2015, has watched legions of sophomores enter Leverett House still trying to find their footing at the College, and come out on the other side three years later as newly minted Harvard graduates. He has also bonded with the tutors and their families, describing Leverett as a very “family-oriented” place. “I’ve watched a lot of kids from belly to five years old,” he says.
His guard office, where he works from 4 p.m. to midnight Monday through Friday, overlooks Leverett’s grassy courtyard. It’s a perfect spot for catching the evening traffic of students as they come in and out of the house. Over the course of the interview, more than a dozen students stop by to greet Mike. Their conversations are familiar and easy as they update each other on their days and riff on inside jokes.
Beyond these daily encounters, he’s formed a slew of close connections with Leverett students and has heard many of their stories. “They would cry in here,” he says. “It made me feel special that some people trusted me to come and share these types of stories.”
Indeed, Leverett residents attest to the compassion he brings to his role in the community. “Mike stands out. And he stands out because he’s a great guy,” says Jack R. Walker ’24, who has spent time talking with Mike about ROTC and Mike’s car detailing business, among other topics. “I have met few people at Harvard as willing to be vulnerable, as insistent on nurturing genuine relationships as Mike,” Malachi S. Robinson ’23 says. “My conversations with him have stretched my heart, and made me more human.”
Mike is aware of his special position as a figure in an undergrad residential house, a place where many students are “away from home, away from their comfort zone.” In this role, he is frequently a listener. “Sometimes people just need an ear. People don’t always want your advice,” he explains. “They’ve got people telling them stuff. I’m not their parent or anything like that," he says, "but some people just want to express themselves and not feel like they’re being judged.”
Mike’s kindness towards students has extended beyond just conversation. Mike remembers one winter when he noticed that two Leverett students never seemed to be wearing jackets. Only “sweaters,” sometimes “a little hat,” Mike says. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, he purchased one student a jacket.
“She was a sophomore at the time, so I wanted her to have a jacket that I knew would last,” he explains. “A North Face jacket with inserts.” The student cried upon receiving it, he says. “She couldn’t even talk.”
As for the other student, Mike recalls: “One day, I was sitting there talking to him, and I was like ‘Bro, you need to get a coat.’ He was like, ‘I’m working on it, I’m working on it. I just don’t have the money right now.’ So I went and got him a coat.”
But Mike’s relationship with students hasn’t been one-sided. Robinson says his friendship with Mike began with assisting him after learning of an unexpected loss at the end of one of their conversations. “Right when I planned to leave, Mike chose to make a tearful confession to me: His brother had just been killed by a stray bullet in Atlanta while riding into a gas station with his girlfriend and their child,” Robinson says. “This was not a revelation I was expecting at the time, and, I believe, not one which Mike had planned to make.”
Mike says he had received the news shortly before his interaction with Robinson. “Malachi went and walked out, came back and said, ‘You know, what? Can I take your hand in prayer? Can we pray together?’” he recalls. “That meant a lot. I was trying so hard not to cry. Because I was like, damn, for somebody to care that much, to come back and pray with me — I was just like, wow, this dude right here. And since then, it’s nothing but love.”
“I don’t remember what I said, but I know that it was a profound moment for the two of us,” Robinson says.
Mike used to spend hours talking to his brother on the phone every day. “There were times students would even come by and say, ‘Oh, Mike, I haven’t seen you in a while. Every time I was going to stop in I’d see you on the phone.’ I was on the phone with my brother,” Mike says. “Now I’m never on the phone.”
The brevity of life comes up repeatedly in our conversation. “I never like to refer to life as a game,” Mike tells me. “But, you know, somebody told me, ‘Life is a game man, and you gotta learn how to play the game.’ It was right at a time when my brother passed. So I said, ‘Well, you know, in this game of life, there’s no scoreboard that tells you how much time you got left on your clock. You don’t know when the whistle blows. There is no scoreboard to tell you that it’s the fourth quarter, that there are two minutes left. So you’ve just got to live your life how you want to live it.”
Mike currently owns and operates an auto detailing business, which “blew up a lot bigger than expected” in recent years. He mentions that he might not be able to keep up with the demand if he keeps working for the business part-time. Mike often thinks about leaving the guard position to work full-time, which he had planned on doing with his brother.
Still, he remains at Leverett. His days often begin at 5:30 a.m.; sometimes, he works a double shift, working 16 hours straight, and does detailing work after he gets off. “Sometimes I’m like, okay, you know what? I’m gonna quit, but then I’m like, ‘I’ll wait until this one graduates.’” And for all the challenges this decision entails, he remains “grateful for everything I get, good and bad,” he says.
A group of incoming Leverett students (he calls them “rising rabbits”) shows up outside Mike’s office at one point in our conversation, all donning LED green rabbit ears from Housing Day. “Are you Mike?” one asks. “We’ve heard so much about you,” says another. He learns all of their names immediately and is soon bantering with them.
Mike admits that his younger self couldn’t have anticipated his role today. “I always said I wanted a job in the back of the warehouse where I didn’t have to talk to no one,” he says, but “my happiness comes from helping other people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Planning and Development Agency approved a slew of affordable housing across four sites in Allston-Brighton last week, though some local artists took issue with the displacement of studio space.
All four developments are set to include affordable housing units, with three offering properties for ownership — together bringing nearly 500 new affordable residences to Allston-Brighton. The approvals come amid an affordable housing crisis in the neighborhood, which some residents have tied to Harvard’s Allston expansion projects.
The BPDA Board of Directors met on March 16 to review development plans and hear public comments from residents. The board approved projects at 1234-1240 Soldiers Field Rd., 119 Braintree St., 52 Everett St., and 75 Tremont St., as well as four developments outside Allston-Brighton.
The Davis Companies are set to invest $366 million into the redevelopment of 1234-1240 Soldiers Field Rd., the former home of the Boston Skating Club. The site will include three residential buildings, comprising around 450 residential units, with 148 units of affordable housing as well as retail space and a hotel.
Resident Leonid Ostrovskiy, who said he commutes past the property daily, supported the project, adding that the old building’s removal was long overdue.
“This site increasingly needs to be redeveloped and upgraded, as it’s an eyesore to the community,” Ostrovskiy said.
The development at 75 Tremont St. will incorporate approximately 82 affordable units, while the 52 Everett St. project, located in Allston Yards, will offer about 174 affordable housing units. Both are set to include new Bluebikes stations.
The project at 119 Braintree St. will include a 12-story building with lab, research, and office space and first-floor retail and restaurant space, as well as a seven-story residential building with a majority of affordable housing. The residential buildings will consist of roughly 88 rental units, 74 of which will be income-restricted.
During public comment for the 119 Braintree St. proposal, many local artists came forward, some supportive and others apprehensive.
David Jackel, who co-runs a video production company out of 119 Braintree St. with his wife, Shana Bethune, said he is concerned for the future of the arts in Boston.
“Shana and I were saddened to learn about the plans to demolish this special building and displace the unique community that’s thrived here for decades,” Jackel said. “We are also concerned that this project, and similar projects, will cause irreparable damage to the rich, artistic, and creative culture of Boston.”
Allston-Brighton artists have complained that local trends are driving out the neighborhood’s historic arts scene, with the displacement of several studio spaces in recent months. The neighborhood’s Sound Museum, a longtime rehearsal space for area musicians, announced plans in December 2022 to close as their building is replaced with a biotech research complex.
Nile S. Hawver, a Boston-area artist whose photography studio is being displaced by the 119 Braintree St. project, said in an interview that despite the inconvenience to him, he supports the creation of affordable housing.
“I’m a huge proponent for affordable housing and just housing in general. The city desperately needs it, but you know, obviously, the unfortunate byproduct of that is that I needed to find a new studio,” Hawver said.
Hawver added that developers should take into consideration the needs of local artists when designing new properties, explaining that most rental spaces are “not very large.”
“Anything that was suitable for my needs, or often the needs of artists, would be significantly larger than any one person could afford or need,” Hawver said. “Not the lack of artist space, but the lack of any space is a complication.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Research co-authors Piers M. Gooding and Lydia X.Z. Brown discussed the ethics of artificial intelligence in mental health treatment during a Wednesday evening Harvard Law School webinar.
Gooding and Brown, co-authors of the 2022 report “Digital Futures in Mind: Reflecting on Technological Experiments in Mental Health and Crisis Support” were joined by experts in artificial intelligence in medicine and mental health, including Carlos A. Larrauri, a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner and member of the board of directors of the National Alliance on Mental Illness; Rhonda Moore, a program director at the National Institutes of Health; and Sara Gerke, an assistant professor at Penn State Dickinson Law.
The event was co-sponsored by the Harvard Law School Project on Disability, the Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics, and GlobalMentalHealth@Harvard.
Brown, an adjunct lecturer and a core faculty member in the Disability Studies Program at Georgetown University, opened the webinar by contextualizing technological developments — such as social media surveillance — to address mental health concerns in the scope of systemic inadequacies.
Brown’s conversations with community members on social media revealed fear surrounding the dangers of sharing online information regarding mental health concerns.
“This fear is largely driven by a particular concern that data may be shared not only with the company providing a social media platform but with local law enforcement in dangerous and sometimes deadly attempts to intervene in a person’s mental health crisis by applying a carceral response,” they said.
Gooding, a research fellow at the Melbourne Law School, described the research group’s collaborative approach and central incorporation of people who “had drawn on lived experience with engaging with mental health services or experiencing mental health conditions.”
In response to the argument that regulatory and legal frameworks could stifle technological development, Gooding said “we came at it from the perspective that regulation is more about protecting people’s rights, both individually and collectively.”
Following Brown and Gooding’s discussion of the findings presented in their publication, the panelists individually spoke about their thoughts on the efficacy and implications of using technology to address mental health.
Larrauri began by sharing his personal journey with mental health struggles. He discussed the impact of these experiences in shaping his position as a proponent of artificial intelligence in mental health treatment, especially in early intervention.
“We must push for a patient-centered approach, grounded in robust, ethical principles,” Larrauri said.
Following Larrauri’s insights, Gerke provided an overview of both potential advantages and restrictions of using innovative technology to treat mental health concerns, weighing the broad accessibility of digital resources, the growing need for healthcare services, and objectivity against the privacy concerns surrounding artificial intelligence developed for these purposes.
“To conclude, AI mental health apps and chatbots are promising, but also raise several ethical and also legal challenges that we should address before releasing them uncontrolled on the market and potentially harming patients,” she said.
Moore spoke next on the report’s lack of coverage of socioeconomic disparities exacerbated by AI in what she described as the Global South and the Global North. Looking towards the future, she stressed the importance of ethnographic exploration in the Global South in “postcolonial computing, decolonial computing, and data extractivism.”
In a lively discussion following the panel, Brown addressed a question regarding how to set ethical boundaries in AI-driven mental health initiatives.
“It is impossible to divorce use cases from social, cultural, and political structures and realities,” they said, referencing the larger context of existing systemic issues.
In an interview following the event, Gooding said he hopes their research “helps to clear the fog of hype and promote a very sober and clear-eyed public discussion about the possibilities and perils of data-driven and algorithmic technology in the mental health context.”
Correction: March 27, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that webinar was solely sponsored by the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics. In fact, the event was co-sponsored by the Harvard Law School Project on Disability, the Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics, and GlobalMentalHealth@Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Undergraduate Workers Union organizers estimate that more than 50 percent of eligible students have signed union cards, which would put the group above the threshold necessary for the National Labor Relations Board to conduct a union election.
According to HUWU’s internal spreadsheet tracking the card campaign, organizers have collected 111 union authorization cards, 54.1 percent of the estimated 205 eligible undergraduate workers. The organization used shift lists and self-reported data from workers to determine the number of undergraduates eligible to be represented by HUWU.
When the card campaign concludes, organizers will file an election petition with the National Labor Relations Board. After the board verifies the cards and confirms that at least 30 percent of eligible workers have signed them, they will direct an election. Should a majority of eligible workers vote to form a union, HUWU will be officially recognized.
“I’m not really scared about a lack of support,” HUWU organizer Syd D. Sanders ’24 said.
Sanders said HUWU won’t know how many undergraduate student workers it can represent until its card campaign concludes and the board verifies cards.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the total number of undergraduate workers at Harvard.
Organizers are taking what they call a “sector-by-sector” approach to unionization, where they will first attempt to unionize student workers at specific workplaces for an initial contract with the University. After official recognition, organizers plan to submit an “Armour-Globe” petition to the National Labor Relations Board, which would expand union protections to all other undergraduates not included.
According to HUWU, eligible undergrad workplaces include Harvard’s libraries and cafes, the Queen’s Head Pub in Memorial Hall, the Office of BGLTQ+ Student Life, The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, and the Women’s Center.
When HUWU launched publicly in early February, it planned to include library workers only at Widener and Lamont libraries. But anticipating a challenge from the University based on insufficient representation, HUWU expanded last week to include other libraries, including Frances Loeb Library, Houghton Library, and the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.
Sanders anticipates Harvard will argue that the number of undergraduate workers is larger than HUWU had assumed in order to reduce the fraction that have signed cards.
“We’re just trying to cover bases, so that whatever the negotiated unit does end up being, we have at least 30 percent of the cards signed,” Sanders said.
“It’s like a strategic game,” he added.
Organizers say they intentionally began unionizing a wide variety of workplaces so they could argue their unit was a good representation of undergraduate student workers as a whole.
“I would say my work is very different than a cafe worker’s, and so we’re saying we’re representative of undergraduate workers at Harvard, and we want to unite all undergraduate workplaces,” said Brit G. Shrader ’23, an intern in the Office of BGLTQ+ Student Life and a HUWU organizer.
“But that’s further down the line,” they added.
Shrader said that while they have had a good experience as a student worker, they don’t have an official contract and they’ve never gotten a raise.
“I was looking through documents and I was like, ‘I don’t really know how I’m employed without having signed any form of recognition of my job,’” they said.
Newton, the University spokesperson, also declined to comment on whether undergraduate workers sign contracts.
Emma H. Lu ’26, a barista at Cafe Gato Rojo and member of Student Labor Action Movement at Harvard said she is supportive of the effort and has already signed a union authorization card.
“People are generally really receptive to the idea of unionizing,” Lu said.
She said she hopes HUWU is able to bargain for a contract that raises their wages and improves transparency from Harvard.
Since the fall semester, organizers said they have been visiting workplaces on campus to talk to undergraduate workers, providing information about their campaign, and most recently, asking workers to sign cards.
“We essentially got to a certain point in our walkthroughs where we felt like we were ready and had already talked to everyone who we needed to talk to to do the card campaign,” Shrader said.
Yet some undergraduate workers say they had not been approached by organizers.
Lamont student media consultant Namira Mehedi ’25 said she didn’t know a lot about the campaign and hadn’t spoken with HUWU organizers, but that she would be open to signing a card.
“I would like to get a little more information about the union policies before I commit to anything, but I would be more open to the idea,” Mehedi said.
Lucy Vuong ’26, who works at the Queen’s Head Pub, said that she remembered seeing HUWU posters around campus, but that she hadn’t been asked about the campaign and did not know if it applied to her.
“I actually didn’t know that these cards existed,” Vuong said.
“I think having student unions is important even if working conditions are good,” she added.
HUWU organizers are hoping to conclude their card campaign and file for an official union election with the National Labor Relations Board by the end of the semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Legal scholars discussed the history of the death penalty in the United States following the landmark Supreme Court ruling Furman v. Georgia at a Harvard Law School Library panel Wednesday afternoon.
Roughly 30 people attended the discussion, titled “Fifty Years After Furman: The Death Penalty in America” and moderated by HLS professor Carol S. Steiker ’82. The panelists included Mugambi Jouet, an associate law professor at the University of Southern California; Corinna B. Lain, a law professor at the University of Richmond; and Michael Meltsner, a law professor at Northeastern University.
The panelists discussed the consequential 1972 Supreme Court case Furman v. Georgia, which concerned a burglar whose gun accidentally fired as he fled, killing a resident of the house. Furman was charged with murder and later sentenced to the death penalty.
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the death penalty for this crime constituted “cruel and unusual punishment” under the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.
During the panel, Jouet said Furman today is known for demonstrating the “arbitrary” and “capricious” nature of capital punishment in the U.S.
Still, this is not what was actually argued in the Court’s briefs, Jouet said, which ultimately made a “humanistic argument” against the death penalty.
“Challenged in the briefs was more based off evolving standards of decency,” Jouet said. “The argument was not fundamentally about race or arbitrariness and effectiveness.”
Lain said public opinion had a strong influence on the Supreme Court’s ruling, noting that the public was split on the issue.
“In November 1971, 49 percent of the public supported the death penalty,” Lain said, citing a historic Gallup poll.
At the time of the ruling, the Legal Defense Fund, a national advocacy organization, had successfully advocated for a moratorium on capital punishment across the U.S.
“When the U.S. Supreme Court considered the case in Furman in 1972, it had already been five years with no executions in the United States,” Lain said.
In the decades following the ruling, many states reconsidered instituting the death penalty, Lain said in an interview following the panel.
“Why did 35 states — even states that abolished it themselves — say, ‘We want the death penalty back?’” Lain said.
Lain said the states’ reconsiderations came from a “tension between mass incarceration and the death penalty.”
“Texas was the last state to adopt life without parole,” Lain said. “It fought against life without parole, not because it didn’t love punitivism, but because it was afraid it would siphon off death cases, which it did.”
In an interview following the panel, Meltsener called for the end of the death penalty.
“People’s fundamental constitutional and human rights, including human dignity, are inalienable, should not depend on public opinion polls,” Meltsener said. “That’s why death penalty can and should be abolished irrespective of public opinion.”

Quantum physicist Mikhail Lukin has been appointed a University Professor, Harvard’s highest faculty rank, the University announced Tuesday.
Lukin will become the Joshua and Beth Friedman University Professor on July 1, replacing former chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber, who quietly retired last month after being convicted of lying to federal investigators in 2021.
In a Thursday press release, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said that Lukin is “central to the University’s ambitions in quantum science and engineering.”
“He produces work that is not only elegant and beautiful, but also enormously promising in its capacity to create innovations that are likely to change many of our lives,” Bacow said. “It is a pleasure to welcome one of the best quantum information scientists in the world into the ranks of the University Professor.”
In an email, Lukin said he was “deeply honored” to be selected among his “truly amazing, incredibly accomplished colleagues” at Harvard.
“I found out about this very recently and to be honest did not have [time] to either fully digest the news or think about if and how this can change my research in the coming years,” Lukin wrote. “But I can tell you that it is a very special time in our field and Cambridge is [a] very special place right now.”
First established in 1935, the University Professorship allows its appointees to teach at any of the University’s 13 schools.
Lukin’s post was established in 2017 by Joshua S. Friedman ’76 and Beth C. Friedman, most recent among all University Professorships.
Lukin’s appointment follows the naming of three scholars to University Professor at the beginning of this year. Lukin will join 24 other University Professors, including President Emeritus Lawrence H. Summers and President Emerita Drew G. Faust.
Lukin graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology summa cum laude in 1993 with a degree in applied physics and mathematics, and received his Ph.D. in physics from Texas A&M University in 1998. He first came to Harvard as a postdoctoral fellow in 1998 before starting as an assistant professor in the Physics Department in 2001. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a co-founder of two startups that work with quantum technology.
At Harvard, Lukin directs both the Harvard Quantum Initiative in Science and Engineering and the Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms, along with the Lukin Group, his research lab.
His work is focused on quantum optics and atomic physics, which deals with controlling photons, electrons, and atoms in quantum systems. His research also touches on quantum information science — the application of quantum mechanics to computer science and information science.
“We are trying to build new kinds of quantum machines and understand if and how they can be used to advance both cutting edge scientific frontier and to solve practical real world problems,” Lukin wrote in his email. “This is one of the most exciting fields in science and engineering.”
The University has recently launched multiple new initiatives in quantum science, including starting one of the world’s first Ph.D. programs in the field and partnering with Amazon Web Services to drive research and innovation in quantum networking.
“At Harvard we have a truly extraordinary community that includes an exceptional group of students, postdocs, and faculty that closely collaborate across many departments and Schools, making it a very special place to do this work,” Lukin said in the University’s press release.
“With this professorship, I hope to be able to help elevate this work even further by bringing together scientists and engineers to explore new scientific directions, make new discoveries, and realize applications that address the biggest challenges facing the world,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard released final versions of the school’s first University-wide non-discrimination and anti-bullying policies on Wednesday, establishing resolution procedures for discrimination and harassment complaints across the school for the first time.
The policy changes, sent to Harvard affiliates Wednesday afternoon by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, largely resemble draft versions of the policies Harvard released last April. The Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — approved the changes last December following a comment period that concluded in September 2022. The policies are set to take effect Sept. 1, 2023.
The announcement comes more than two years after Garber established a committee and convened three working groups in January 2021 to review Harvard’s sexual misconduct, discrimination, and bullying policies. The working groups were established as a result of an agreement between Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the University in the union’s first contract.
Garber’s Wednesday announcement did not include the final version of Harvard’s updated sexual harassment and misconduct policies, which Harvard will finalize after the Biden administration releases updates to its Title IX regulations on how educational institutions handle sex and gender-based discrimination complaints. The federal updates are expected to come in May.
Still, Harvard intends to have its updated Title IX and sexual misconduct policies take effect on Sept. 1 — alongside its non-discrimination and anti-bullying policies — pending implications of the revised Title IX rules, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
Harvard currently prohibits discrimination on the basis of several legally protected identifying characteristics, including race, religion, and national origin. The new non-discrimination policy broadly defines discrimination as “adverse treatment of an individual” based on one or more of a set of defined “protected characteristics.”
The final list of protected characteristics includes “political beliefs,” a category that was left out of the draft policies released last year.
The released anti-bullying policy, however, does not limit its protections to a defined list of characteristics, instead defining bullying as “harmful interpersonal aggression by words or actions that humiliate, degrade, demean, intimidate, or threaten an individual or individuals.”
Both proposed policies include informal and formal resolution procedures for discrimination and bullying complaints. Individuals seeking to file a discrimination or bullying complaint can only remain anonymous under informal procedures.
To file a formal complaint, an individual must submit a written description of the alleged discrimination or bullying to designated officials in each school or a central office tasked with overseeing the policies. An individual seeking informal resolution should first consult the designated officials in the appropriate school, except if they object on the grounds of “alleged conflict of interest or bias,” in which case they may bring the matter to the central office.
The policy also notes that an informal complaint “does not automatically launch an inquiry or investigation.”
The structure and staffing of the central office are currently in consideration and have not been finalized, according to Newton.
In his Wednesday email announcement, Garber wrote the policies are designed to ensure Harvard affiliates feel “truly welcome to participate in the full range of University life.”
“We know that policies and procedures alone cannot cultivate the kind of culture and community we aspire to,” Garber wrote. “They play an important role by setting basic standards. But we can and must do more, treating each other with respect and dignity and fostering an environment at Harvard where everyone can thrive and do their best work.”

For all the college students who celebrate — Happy Ramadan (Ramadan Mubarak)! For most of us in our college years, it can be difficult to imagine a fulfilling Ramadan experience without the comfort of your family and delicious home-cooked meals at the end of a long fast. As a freshman, I was really nervous about what Ramadan would be like at Harvard. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy my time and I found that you can still make the most of this month, even away from home. Here are some tips that will hopefully help you to discover the same!
Prepare For Suhoor/Sehri In Advance 
If you’ve been struggling with waking up for that 9 a.m., make sure to think ahead about planning for suhoor/sehri. You can grab pre-bagged individual breakfast through the Harvard bag meal portal from HUDS. If you would like to cook with friends in one of the house kitchens, you can also order packouts of breakfast ingredients online through the Harvard packout system. There’s also a list of kitchens in every house and the Yard that you can check out here. Last year, since I knew I was lazy tight on time, I would have overnight oats, smoothies or granola bars ready for a quick suhoor.
Talk To Your Roomies
Let your roommates know how things may be different in the upcoming weeks. Let them know that you will be waking up early in the morning to start your fast and how that may mean extra alarms in the morning. Perhaps getting that single now would be a better idea for everyone or it may be better to have meals in the common room. It could also be good to explain what Ramadan is and how yes, you can’t even drink water and how you may be missing out on group lunches and dinners for a while.
Reschedule That Lab 
If your lab is around the time to break fast, try talking to your professor to see if you can reschedule the lab to an earlier time for a week or two. Alternatively, see if you can step out for a bit to break your fast. Most professors are easy to talk to and will be very considerate of your needs — just make sure to let them know in advance! Same thing applies to sections and lectures.
RSVP For The Soch Iftars
Ramadan is always more fun with a community of people to break fast with. This Ramadan, RSVP for the iftars at the SOCH held by the Harvard Muslim Chaplain. These nightly iftars invite members of the Harvard community, including students, staff and faculty. If you miss the SOCH iftar, you can also request a to-go container from your dining hall with a halal entree.
All Nighters in Cabot Cafe
My favorite part of Ramadan was pulling all nighters in Cabot after getting a drink from our favorite cafe — Cabot Cafe. During Ramadan, I found it easier to study for exams and do a chunk of my homework from the time between iftar and suhoor/sehri while I could still snack and consume unhealthy amounts of caffeine. After suhoor, I would catch up on sleep.
Buddy System 
One of the biggest tips I heard from other Muslims was to seek out community — do things with other people as much as you can! It can be isolating to do Ramadan away from home for the first time for so many people. One way to find other Muslims to do fasts with, is to reach out to the Harvard Islamic Society and attend some of their Ramadan programming. The SOCH iftars will also be a great time to say hello to a few new people!
Keep Simple Goals 
As we fight for our lives to secure an internship, deal with the pressure of courses and the ongoing crisis of existing — keep simple goals for your ibadah during college life. Don’t compare your journey with anyone else. Maybe this Ramadan will be about praying all five prayers on time, reading one ayah a day, making intentional duas, or fasting at least once a week. Consistency and intentionality is key!
Carry Dates and Water Everywhere
Even if you plan to break your fast at the SOCH or at dinner — you never know! Keep a date and a water bottle on hand just in case you’re stuck somewhere and it’s time to eat. Better safe than sorry, we promise.
Happy Ramadan to all those who celebrate! May this month be filled with lots of blessings and cherished memories for all of you. We hope that these tips will be your guide for the rest of your college years!
