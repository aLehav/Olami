After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By trumpeting the results of its recent poll as proof that students support a reversal in Harvard’s ROTC policy, the Harvard Republican Club has misrepresented the significance of a highly unscientific exercise. Last week, the HRC concluded its poll of Harvard undergraduates with an impressive 1,700 responses, 62% of which favored official recognition of ROTC at the College. Yet the HRC’s claim that the poll shows “strong support for official recognition of ROTC among Harvard students” is dubious at best. A substantial self-selection bias and a low response rate show that this poll can tell us very little about opinions towards ROTC on campus. The discussion it has provoked, however, is a sign of the issue’s importance on campus, and the conversation on this policy should continue with more representative polling by the HRC and other interested organizations.
This poll’s various flaws make it a highly inaccurate barometer of the opinions of the student body. The nature of the poll, in which students were emailed a link and given the option to respond, lends itself to a self-selection bias. Only the students interested in answering the email, and if so, the specific questions presented in the poll, would participate in the exercise. Therefore, since there is a clear and significant difference between the population that selected into the survey and that which did not, any claim that the views of the 26 percent of Harvard students who responded to the poll are representative of the opinions of the 74 percent who did not is groundless.
In addition, any student possessing an opinion more nuanced than a simple “yes” or “no” would have difficulty express his or her opinion on such a complex issue, given the phrasing of the question. The HRC has acknowledged the existence of a self-selection bias, but still claims that its poll demonstrates that “student opinion” is “at odds with Faculty opinion” on the ROTC question. This is certainly not the case when the poll in question is sent out online, offers a narrow range of survey choices, and gathers responses from only a quarter of the student body.
It is true that various groups, including The Crimson, send polls out online every year using similar methodologies to gather results. These are no more accurate than the ROTC poll, but they are also not used to advocate major policy changes on highly charged issues. 
The responses to the HRC poll and the discussion it has created does show that there is a great deal of campus interest in this contentious issue, however, and groups from across the spectrum should continue a vibrant conversation on the policy.  
Specifically, the HRC and other interested groups should engage in a more scientific poll if they wish to gauge true student opinion on this policy. The polling should include random sampling to gain a more accurate representation of the student body, as well as more survey choices to properly reflect the nuanced positions that many students hold. This exercise could continue to forward discussion on an important topic and allow more students a route to voice their opinion.
Though while we are interested to see what better polling would uncover, our position on the fundamental question of ROTC recognition will not change no matter what the results are, because this is an issue of discrimination that should not be decided by majority opinion. Harvard should welcome ROTC back when ROTC welcomes all students to join, not in response to any poll—especially a poll as flawed as this one.

Over one third of Americans are obese, and nearly another third is overweight. Though the numbers—and waistlines—have been growing for years, the federal government is finally taking steps to solve America’s health problem. Along with other measures to revamp our nation’s healthcare system, Congress is planning to offer tax-credits and other subsidies to employers who reward their employees for healthy behavior. Lawmakers want to make it easier for businesses to encourage their employees to quit smoking, head to the gym, keep a better diet, and lose weight, a plan which does not seem to have any detriments. Such measures by Congress will benefit all Americans, helping people to become happier and healthier. 
When employees are unhealthy, the damage extends beyond their diminished contribution to the work place—felt through numerous sick days or inability to complete tasks—to a hindrance on the American healthcare system. For this reason, subsidizing programs that encourage healthful choices will ultimately benefit the U.S. A healthier labor force is both more productive and less draining on the health care system as a whole.
Though we fully support government subsidies for employers who spur their employees to healthful action, we hope that all programs sponsored by the government will be bonuses for those who make healthful decisions rather than penalties for those who do not. While we wish that all Americans would choose to follow a well-balanced diet, we do not think it is acceptable for employers to punish employees who reach for a cookie rather than an apple. Hopefully, the incentive of a free gym membership or some extra money for quitting smoking will be impetus enough for employees to make healthful choices, without the threat of a punishment should they not. 
Moreover, we recognize the potential for confusion following this plan. As such, CDC experts should be the ones to determine objective guidelines for what constitutes a health-conscious decision and what does not. Experts should design programs with concrete standards in place and publish guidelines stating what exactly composes an activity that is acceptable to incentivize, in order to avoid abuse by businesses. Additionally, we hope that Congress takes measures to offset the increased complexity of the tax code, and the difficulty workers will face when trying to figure out whether a free gym-membership, for example, must be accounted for in their income tax returns. 
All in all, we view this legislation as a small step at the beginning of a longer-term goal to increase the overall health of Americans. Congress must proceed cautiously to ensure that employees are motivated to get into shape in a way that is both fair and beneficial to the nation as a whole. Surely the obesity epidemic cannot be stopped overnight, but encouraging employees to get on the Stairmaster is a small step toward that end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was just one month ago that an unemployed charity worker—failed singer, romantic exile—lived alone in her family’s home in Blackburn, Scotland, shunned by a world with no place for a 47-year old ugly duckling whose sole talent was obscured by her plain and aging appearance. Though the taunts of sixth grade bullies still echoed in the back of her mind, the passing of her 97-year-old mother pushed her to peek out of her shell for just one more, all-or-nothing performance. As Susan Boyle walked onto the stage of “Britain’s Got Talent,” she brushed off the laughter of the audience with unassuming familiarity. What neither she nor they knew was that this duckling was about to deliver anything but a swan’s song. 
In the midst of the applause, inspirational music, and tears that followed, it became clear that Boyle was set to be the new water cooler discussion topic and national media darling. Just weeks later, she was on Oprah with a makeover, her performance racking up YouTube hits in the multimillions.
Boyle’s story is one we’ve heard thousands of times before. Her rags-to-riches ascent joins the long tradition of Cinderella, Philoctetes, Cyrano de Bergerac, the frog prince, and Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. No doubt the producers of “Britain’s Got Talent” knew this when they decided to recast the age-old archetype on a modern stage like so many authors, playwrights, and bards before them. The fresh angle in Boyle’s case, though, is that this isn’t a puppet show Christmas special or a child’s folk tale—this is reality. As scripted and replete with emotional cues for obedient audience members as her journey has been, Boyle is still a real person with a real back-story. It’s this reality, lurking behind the crafting inherent in all “reality” TV, that should give us pause before we swallow wholesale the narratives that networks feed us.
In a sense, Susan Boyle represents the fullest realization of the media’s memoir-molding potential. The combination of reality television and YouTube’s diffusive power catapulted a nobody into a worldwide phenomenon in a matter of minutes, ushering in a supposed moral revelation for pop culture in the process. They plucked a better-than-average singer from obscurity and made her, in the words of BGT judge Amanda Holden, “the biggest wake-up call ever.” 
However, too few people seem to realize that we shouldn’t have been sleeping in the first place. The idea that talent correlates with physical appearance is a relic of Chaucerian thinking that has somehow still managed to permeate the culture of American Idolatry in spite of what we preach to our schoolchildren. Without the enduring assumption that a beautiful face precedes an equally attractive voice, we’d never have heard of her—an embarrassing sign that Rudolf’s isn’t so elementary a lesson as the age of his target audience might suggest. If Susan Boyle has taught us anything, it’s that the beggar-to-princess narrative hasn’t.
And unfortunately, despite whatever epiphanies Holden and various pop-culture commentators have claimed she’s brought to us, the very fact that Boyle is real (in the flesh and the falsetto) means that she’s actually less likely to change anything than an animated ogre turned unlikely hero. Unlike storybook fables, human interest clichés like Boyle’s story are constantly pushed aside for the next season’s craze—as modern parables, they can’t last. Indeed, despite all of its potential for crafting the perfect narrative arc, reality TV’s pitfall in the business of moralizing seems to be its unapologetic reality. Next year, YouTubers will find another craze, Britons will find another media darling, and Simon Cowell will find another unlikely star to mine for ratings. Boyle will land a record deal and sell enough albums to live comfortably to a ripe old age. But the next time a buffoonish-looking, middle-aged woman with a stellar soprano auditions for Britain’s Got Talent, she won’t make it very far—that’s already been done. Money, not principle, will always be the goal, and in a music scene full of Beyoncé Knowleses and Kelly Clarksons, there’s still room for only one Susan Boyle.
Vladimir Nabokov once commented that “reality” was one of the few words in the English language that is meaningless without quotation marks. Reality TV gives this observation a whole new meaning—one that makes me wonder whether those who wish to follow in the footsteps of Britain’s newest talent would be better off had she, too, been a fairytale.

Recently, relations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, led by its most powerful member, the United States of America, and the Russian Federation have begun to resemble the hottest years of the Cold War, with talk of opposing missile shields and accusations of spying on both sides. And despite President Obama’s recent attempts to “reset” the United States’ diplomatic relationship with Russia, tensions between NATO and Russia are still on the rise.  
A major issue in NATO-Russia relations has been the conflict between NATO and Russia over control in several parts of the post-Soviet sphere, especially the Caucasian state of Georgia. Indeed, many security analysts have concurred that former President Bush’s declaration of support for Georgia’s NATO membership bid was a major factor in last August’s war between Georgia and Russia. Since then, Georgia, which still hopes to join the alliance, has been a sticking point in NATO-Russia relations. NATO’s recent decision to go ahead with planned military exercises in Georgia this week will do nothing to help matters. The decision to hold the exercises in Georgia and to disregard the diplomatic implications of such an action is foolish, and it can lead to nothing but more unnecessary conflict. 
The military exercises, which have involved troops from 15 countries, are connected to NATO’s Partnership for Peace. Russia, as a member of the Partnership for Peace, was invited to join in the exercises, but could hardly be expected to participate in military maneuvers in a country it is effectively still at war with. Although these exercises are focused on peacekeeping skills, they have gained importance, particularly for Russia, far above their stated aims. Russia sees the maneuvers, although they had been planned before the Georgia conflict erupted, as a NATO threat against Russia and, in particular, its military presence in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
The timing and the location of the exercises, which are being held not even a year after the conflict on Georgian territory, justifies, to some extent, Russia’s suspicion that these exercises are a show of NATO solidarity with Georgia against Russia. Since Russia is the only power Georgia has gone to war with recently, Moscow might fairly assume that NATO exercises taking place on Georgian soil are designed to train soldiers for another possible conflict with Russia. If NATO does not intend for Russia to draw this conclusion, then it would be prudent for NATO to cease the exercises and conduct them in a politically less dangerous location. 
There is also, perhaps, some truth to the statement by Dmitry Rogozin, the Russian envoy to NATO, that NATO would be wiser to hold the exercises “in some psychiatric hospital” than in Georgia, given the current state of affairs. Protests calling for Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to resign have rocked Tbilisi, for the past month, and the ranks of the protestors have grown to encompass members of the government. One of these, a former parliamentary speaker, even declared to a crowd of protestors that Georgia “is not a democratic country.”  
While the government has allowed the protests to continue without interference, the memory of the government’s violent suppression of protests in 2007 remains a mark on Saakashvili’s record as a democratic leader. And early last week, a tank division mutinied against the government. Whether or not Russia was behind the plot—as Saakashvili has implied—it is a clear indicator that Georgia does not have full control over its military forces. 
Saakashvili has called the exercises a “symbolic event,” and it appears clear that, at least in Saakashvili’s mind, the purpose of these maneuvers is to demonstrate NATO’s solidarity with Georgia and its willingness to defend Georgia against Russia, if need be. Given the suggestions that the August war was at least partly the fault of Saakashvili’s recklessness, however, it seems likely that any suggestion that NATO will come to his aid will only make him bolder, particularly in the face of domestic calls for the return of the breakaway provinces. 
Furthermore, there is no reason to expect that NATO will come to Georgia’s aid with any more enthusiasm than it did in August. NATO condemned Russia’s recognition of the breakaway regions and last September formed a basis for cooperation with the NATO-Georgia Commission. However, supporting Georgia, particularly in a struggle with Russia for territories the rest of the world considers to be relatively minor, would not only be a political disaster for NATO members, but might risk direct war between NATO and Russia. With NATO decreasing its support for the ongoing war in Afghanistan, it is hardly realistic to expect that the alliance will support a small country’s politically dubious conflicts. 
Calling off the exercises after they have already begun might appear to be a show of weakness by NATO, but such an action would be infinitely better than provoking Russia into another war. Even if the exercises cannot be called off at this point, however, they are indicative of a larger problem in NATO’s approach to relations with Russia. While NATO members should not give in to Russia’s every demand, deliberately angering Russia, as former President Bush did last April by supporting Georgia and Ukraine’s unrealistic bids for NATO membership, is, in many cases, unnecessary and foolish. 
Declaring its support for Georgia is a reasonable step for NATO, but demonstrating it in such a provocative manner—especially considering the current state of relations between NATO and Russia—is simply foolish. Since NATO is not prepared to—and should not—throw its full support behind Georgia in another war with Russia, then it should be careful that Russia doesn’t call its bluff.

“Starve the beast” has been the mantra of anti-tax Republicans for decades. But, so far, depriving the “beast”—big government—of revenue hasn’t led to starvation. The beast has had a credit card, a card with a seemingly perennial teaser rate and a credit limit it can more or less set itself. Republican politicians, who would have lost their power to vote tax cuts to their wealthy donors if they hadn’t been re-elected, have not wanted to be implicated in the demise of the source of national defense, social security, medical care, public education, veterans benefits, border protection, etc. So, even though they have controlled Congress and/or the Presidency for all but two and a half of the last twenty-eight years, the beast has always gotten his trans fats and, with minor exceptions, the Republicans have been at least as complicit as Democrats in the fact that the perennially maxed-out credit card keeps overtaking whatever credit limits have been put in place.
Now the Republicans are truly out of power and, if you believe them, the Democrats are using the federal credit card to throw one crazy party. Yet, while it now indeed appears that the fiscal year 2010 federal deficit could surpass 13 percent of GDP, the borrowing is hardly paying for a party. Ironically, with the Democrats in full control of the federal government for the first time in 14 years, the beast, while in no imminent danger of death by starvation, is gravely malnourished. This is the case because the beast has two components: the federal government, but also the many state and local governments. Only the former has a credit card. Aside from tax revenues, state and local governments survive on charity from the feds and very limited borrowing power from other sources. 
The malnourishment is at the state and local level. Yesterday’s Washington Post reports how widespread layoffs and curtailment of services by state and local governments are accelerating in spite of the $135 billion dollar “stabilization fund” that is being funneled to the states from the stimulus package (a fund cut by more than $40 billion to win the support of the three Republican senators who voted for cloture). The worst is yet to come. The executive director of the National Governors Association has testified that states are facing a $200 billion deficit over the next two years, a deficit that, in the absence of more federal assistance, can only be covered by lay-offs. 
The 
trauma of my native state of California has been especially acute and 
is about to get worse. With housing values falling 40% or more and unemployment 
at 11.2% as of mid-April and climbing, the State has already suffered 
through a protracted political standoff between Democratic and Republican 
lawmakers to plug a $41 billion budget shortfall. The deal that was 
finally  struck will entail many painful cuts. In March, the month 
after the deal was struck, 27,000 educators received lay-off notices. 
Moreover, the complicated deal is in large measure contingent upon approval 
of a series of ballot propositions that are set to be voted on May 19. 
With plenty not to like in the details of the compromise, it appears 
that the propositions will get the thumbs down.  It took the better part of a year to achieve the compromise that will probably fail, so the prospects for a better, or least more palatable compromise any time soon appear dim. The State will run out of money in July. Stay tuned.
Joy in Limbaughland? Laid off school teachers, nurses, firemen, and policemen, overcrowded emergency rooms, courts that don’t function, motor vehicle offices that are open three days a week. Are these the images that will warm the hearts of the anti-tax Republicans? Probably not, and they certainly won’t increase the prospects of a Republican resurgence any time soon.
Government is not a beast. If the banks are the life support of the economy, our various governments are the sine qua non for our quality of life. They mete out justice, protect us from violence and environmental degradation, educate our children, construct our infrastructure, provide medical care to the aged and disadvantaged, and are the expression of our common values and democratic choices. The consequences of depriving our state and local governments of critical funding will be felt at a very human level by our most vulnerable citizens. The private cost of public poverty cuts to the heart of what makes us a great nation, the “Shining City on the Hill” so dear to disciples of Ronald Reagan. President Reagan was fond of saying that “government is the problem.” If nothing else good emerges from these next few months in states like California, at least the facile rhetoric of “government is the problem” and “starve the beast” will finally, a generation after Reagan, have lost its currency.

Quad living will get a little tougher next year, according to many residents.Quadlings cited concerns about safety and an anticipated decline in the quality of residential life due to budget cuts announced on Monday by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The reductions are geared towards helping FAS close a $220 million annual deficit.In particular, the plan to terminate shuttle service to the Quad next year at 1:30 a.m. from Sunday to Wednesday—when it has previously ended at 3:45—sparked anger among Quad students. Many said that this cut, along with the end of service at the Quad library, will force many to do work at Lamont Library and face an inconvenient and unsafe commute back from the Yard.  “This isn’t an issue of Quad kids whining, it’s really an issue of safety,” said Tessa K. Lyons-Laing ’11. “Student safety should never be a bullet point on a list of ways to save money.”  Anna Raginskaya ’11, a Pforzheimer resident, stressed that the situation was especially dangerous for female students.“It really puts you in a situation where sexual violence could occur simply because you don’t have the option to go home,” she said. “If Harvard was concerned about the safety of its women, Harvard should make it so that if a girl feels uncomfortable in a situation, she can get out of it.” Scott M. Elfenbein ’11 said that he also believed the cuts to the shuttle service will be a safety concern, but added that he thought they exacerbated the more important issue of the House budget cuts.“Our entire social lives cannot exist in the river and then they still expect us to live in the Quad,” said Elfenbein, who added that House activities and events were the main highlights of Quad life.Although many students said they felt Quad residents were being disproportionately affected, most said they understood that the extra impact was incidental. “I don’t think they’re out to target the Quad,” said Manny J. Antunes ’11. “The Quad is disenfranchised because it’s far away. When you take away a service across the board it will seem to affect the Quad more because we’re already disenfranchised.”Still, several students said they were dissatisfied with the timing of the announcement.“It’s very worrisome that the students are only being asked for input very late in the process,” said Sarah E. Esty ’11. She added that she believed reading period was a difficult time for students who might have wanted to organize a response. “That gives [the administration] a lot of power,” she said.George J.J. Hayward ’11, a UC rep for Currier, said that there has been an overwhelming response to an e-mail that he sent out on Monday night requesting Quad residents to submit their thoughts on the issue.“When you’ve got one out of every four students who are willing to type up a paragraph or two regarding their feelings about the Quad cuts during reading period, you know it’s touched something,” he said.—Staff writer Michelle L.

Harvard junior varsity athletes said they were “blind-sided” Monday when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced that three JV men’s sports—baseball, basketball, and ice hockey—would be cut with the intent of transforming the teams into club programs next year. “This was kind of out of nowhere,” said Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12, a member of the JV baseball team. “Our captain told us that no one had contacted us.” Nicholas P. Manzo ’10, a three-year veteran of the JV basketball team, said that he received no prior notification that his team had been eliminated. “It wasn’t expected but it wasn’t surprising,” Manzo said. “There was no e-mail or anything and we didn’t know beforehand...I don’t think our coaches knew either.”The cut was one of several made by the athletic department to reduce its budget as part of $77 million in reductions across FAS released Monday. Athletic department officials plan to meet with members of the JV teams in the coming weeks to assist with the transition to club status, the players said.Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise and other administrators in the athletic department did not return repeated requests for comment over the past two days.At this moment, players say they are uncertain about what the future holds. Club sports, unlike JV teams, are not funded or managed by the athletic department, and students hold full operational and financial responsibility. Turning a JV team into a club team requires several players to take on administrative duties, including fundraising, scheduling games, buying equipment, hiring coaches, and communicating with the athletic department to book facilities for practices.“Personally I’ve enjoyed club better,” said Jocelyn G. Karlan ’12, treasurer of the women’s club soccer team, which voluntarily became a club team this year with encouragement from the athletic department. “I feel a lot more freedom  as a club team. There’s a challenge but we have our own power to do things.”Citing the success of other club sports, some of the JV athletes affeted by the announcement said they favored the planned change.“We’re optimistic that the change is going to be a good thing,” said Daniel A. Sack ’10, captain of the JV men’s basketball team. “But we would have liked more warning...[We were] pretty much blind-sided.”Other students were less hopeful about the pending change.“I was very disappointed,” Coe-Odess said. “Harvard brags that it has the most sports. To cut JV baseball after such a long tradition is frustrating.”Several athletes voiced their dissatisfaction in how the athletic department has treated JV sports. Players cited a short game schedule, administrative disorganization, and arms-length treatment by the athletic department. According to Kelly N. Bodwin ’11, the athletic department scheduled just a single game against a high school team for JV softball last year.“It’s pretty clear [the athletic department] only cares about varsity,” said Bodwin, who has played for the JV softball, JV women’s ice hockey, and club volleyball teams. “It’s pretty frustrating how they’re trying to get rid of the JV program...They’re just kind of underhanded about the whole thing.”Coe-Odess echoed Bodwin’s sentiments. “I obviously wouldn’t want JV baseball to receive as much attention as varsity, but I think there’s a difference between attention and disregard,” Coe-Odess said. The athletic department also announced plans to close the Malkin Athletic Center this summer, curtail facility projects and upkeep, increase energy conservation initiatives, and reduce team travel budgets in an effort to cut costs. —Staff writer Jake I.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith released an extensive list of cost-cutting measures Monday afternoon—including fewer hot breakfast offerings, the closure of two campus cafes, the downgrading of three junior varsity teams to club status, and reduced shuttle service.
The cutbacks published on the FAS Web site amount to $77 million in projected savings—a third of the total $220 million projected annual deficit that FAS administrators hope to close by July 2011. The cuts will be made over the next several months.
In an interview Monday, Smith said the cuts constitute the first step in a two-part plan to make up the budgetary shortfall. The second stage—branded “reshaping” by Smith—will attempt to close the remaining $143 million gap over the next two years by overhauling the structure of FAS, though professors say they continue to be confused by what the concept means.
Smith said it would have been difficult to plan the cuts earlier, since the Harvard Corporation—the University’s chief governing body—did not announce the eight-percent reduction in the payout rate until March.
In addition to several detailed cuts, such as the closure of the Widener Library Cafe and the Student Organizations Center at Hilles Penthouse coffee bar, the list included a number of vaguer items that implied possible future changes to staff hours, the number of Teaching Assistants and Teaching Fellows who help teach College courses, and long-term capital projects.
In Monday’s interview, Smith and College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds declined to clarify those undefined measures, saying administrators are still in the decision-making process.
Smith declined to offer any specifics about what would happen to staffers now working in the closing cafes, saying only that the administration has not yet reached the point at which they can make concrete decisions about future layoffs.
When asked to cite areas where student life would improve as a result of the cuts, Smith had one answer: improved brain breaks—which will see 40 percent more funding next year.
“I’m a big fan of the brain breaks,” Smith said. “I hear that there’s not enough good food at night, so that was certainly one of our goals.”
Today’s cuts are the culmination of a process that began last December, when Smith urged all departments and administrative units to draft proposals listing possible cost-cutting measures to make up an economic shortfall then projected to be at least $100 million. FAS units identified more than $90 million of possible savings, and $77 million worth of the proposed cuts were selected for implementation, according to Smith.
The Web site will be updated with new cost-cutting measures as they are approved and implemented, but not every reduction will be posted on the site, Smith said at the Faculty meeting last week.
Smith declined to offer any specifics regarding the potential consolidation of different units such as centers, libraries, and academic departments, adding that a set of six working groups will be carefully examining that possibility.

Students criticized planned reductions in Quad shuttle service and hot breakfast offerings at four Town Hall Forums held Monday by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds just hours after the changes were announced.Hammonds began the town hall circuit with low-key, primarily one-on-one meetings in Lamont Café, followed by larger group meetings in Quincy, Cabot, and Mather Houses, where she was joined by other members of the College administration to answer questions and hear students concerns about the changes—part of $77 million in reductions announced by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and published on a dedicated Web site Monday.While administrators called the cuts “a grueling exercise for everyone” and “a shared pain” at the meetings, many students said they disproportionately affected student life and that the process of making cuts had not been transparent.“This whole process shows a fundamental disconnect between what FAS is doing and what matters to students,” said Adams House Committee Co-Chair Amol K. Jain ’10 during the meeting in Quincy. “This stinks of rhetoric—the whole Web site does.”Chief among students’ concerns—especially at the Cabot venue—were cutbacks to the current Quad shuttle schedule.According to the list of reductions published on the FAS Web site, the Sunday through Wednesday shuttle service to the Quad will cease at 1:30 a.m. rather than 3:45 a.m. Shuttle service will also begin at 12:15 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, rather than 8 a.m.Assistant Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin said that shuttle service ended at 12:30 a.m. every night before 2004.In lieu of the shuttle, Hammonds suggested that students rely on rides from the Harvard University Police Department or the evening van services offered by the Passenger Transport Services—which operate until 3 a.m.—though “service reductions will likely take place to this service as well.”But droves of students—especially Quad residents—expressed concern about the dangers of having to walk from the river to the Quad late at night, especially those who rely on Lamont Library as a late-night study space.“We care about your safety,” Hammonds said to the Cabot group. “We don’t want to do anything to put you guys at harm walking back. It was our belief that we could make the reductions in the services and it wouldn’t put you in harm.”When asked what students should do if they need to walk home during a time when neither service is in operation, McLoughlin suggested that students “walk with a friend.”Students’ other primary concern centered on the elimination of hot breakfast during the week at all Houses.During the Lamont Café session, members of the Men’s Varsity Swimming and Diving Team said the elimination of hot breakfast would take away a protein- and calorie-filled meal they and other athletes need after morning practices.Team member C. Andy Krantz ’12 said that the breakfast changes were especially limiting to vegetarians, such as himself, who will have to rely on hard boiled eggs and cheese as their only sources of protein after morning practices.Students at both Quincy and Mather suggested that the College open one river House for hot breakfast each morning to accommodate athletes returning from practices.In addition to concerns over breakfast and shuttle times, students also expressed concern over cuts in student jobs and rumors of potential cuts in House administrators.Also joining Hammonds, Harris, Mayer, and McLoughlin at the meetings were Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Associate Dean of Residential Life Suzy M. Nelson, Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Judith Kidd, and Senior Associate Athletic Director Patricia Henry.While students at all four venues said that they appreciated Hammonds and the other deans taking the time to speak to students about the cuts, many said they wished they had been notified of the meetings earlier. The e-mail announcing the Town Hall Forums was sent to students at 3:40 p.m., just 20 minutes before the first one began.Hammonds said that she and Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith had spent much time over the past few months working on the cuts and wanted to release them before exam period.In addition, students at all four events said that they felt like their opinions had not been solicited in designing the cuts.“We don’t feel involved,” said Manny J. Antunes ’11. “Students were caught by surprise. Students hate to see things cut and not feel like they had a say.”Though Hammonds said that the students did have the chance to voice their opinions on a Web site earlier in the year, she acknowledged that the site “wasn’t well publicized,” and suggested in at least one comment that the negative student reaction did not take her completely by surprise.“I wore orange,” she told students at multiple town halls, “so if there were tomatoes they wouldn’t show.”—Crimson staff writers Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University announced Monday that it will discontinue staffed food services at both the Widener Library Café and the Quad’s Penthouse Coffee Bar in the coming months, although both spaces will remain open for student and staff use.The moves are among $77 million in cuts geared towards helping the Faculty of Arts and Sciences close a $220 million annual budget deficit. Beth S. Brainard, a spokeswoman for Harvard College Library, said that while she could not discuss the specific “big-time dollar amounts” saved by the Widener Café’s closing, she said that “it is a substantial amount.” She noted that the Widener Café cutbacks are part of HCL’s larger budget reduction plan and that the decision to close the Café was made in conjunction with various administrators and Harvard University Dining Services. The Widener Café has been staffed by HUDS for less than two years, though the University previously hired a private contractor to provide staffed food services, Brainard said.The Penthouse Coffee Bar, a featured component of the Student Organization Center at Hilles, debuted in 2006 as part of the University’s efforts to enhance social space at Harvard. But the eatery has been historically underutilized despite College administrators’ hopes that the SOCH would serve as a hub for student groups and enhance the Quad’s appeal.Crista Martin, a spokeswoman for HUDS, wrote in an e-mailed statement that both cafés have had limited patron support, and that determinations about the staff in these locations are pending completion of budget planning. HUDS currently operates both eateries. Veronica M. Maldonado ’11, who works at the Coffee Bar, said that the eatery is entirely staffed by students and added that a student manager noted that jobs may be available at Lamont for those looking to work next year.Samuel T. Jack ’11, editor-in-chief of the Harvard Independent, said that “perhaps the reason that the Penthouse Coffee Bar was under-utilized was that it was never fully functional.” He said that in his experience—the Independent holds production in the SOCH—availability of both food and coffee at the Penthouse has been underwhelming.“Though they advertise pizza, chicken bites, and other snacks, it’s hit or miss as to whether they will have them—and whether they’ll be edible,” said Jack, who added that he is fine with the University’s decision to close the Coffee Bar.  The budget cut announcements, which were posted on a new FAS Web site aimed at providing up-to-date information on cost-cutting measures, said that the Coffee Bar’s espresso machine and vending machines “will remain available if demand is sufficient.” Widener Café will also continue to have microwave ovens and hot water machines, and plans are underway to expand vending machine selections, the Web site said.Jane Kelley, an 18-year veteran of HUDS and the sole employee staffing the Widener Café, said that she decided to accept the University’s early retirement incentive package after administrators finalized plans to close the Café in late April. She added that she understands the University’s rationale for closing the café, which she called a “hidden gem,” but that she is saddened by the move and will miss the students and customers with whom she has built a close, first-name basis rapport. “I understand you have to start small, but I wish there was a way they could have kept it open,” Kelley said. “A lot of undergrads really didn’t know we existed, but once they discovered this place, they loved it.” —Staff writer Peter F.

Chocolate shop L.A. Burdick’s is petitioning to increase its store capacity after a series of recent clashes with neighboring clothing store Settebello over noise complaints.According to Burdick’s assistant manager Jaime Napier, the manager of Settebello came into the café twice last week to take photographs, which he sent to the Cambridge License Commission in order to prove that Burdick’s was over capacity. Napier said that the man posed as a regular customer but that she recognized him from past business exchanges.“He’s playing dirty,” said Napier. “He called the license commission to try to get us in trouble. He’s really going after us.”The incident stems from a long-standing dispute between the stores over noise from the chocolate shop, the subject of frequent complaints from Settebello.C. Philip Levin, the treasurer of Settebello, said that the noise coming from Burdick’s disrupts his business, and that the two stores are engaged in ongoing negotiations regarding the matter.According to Jennifer Fabis, Burdick’s Director of Human Resources, the café has taken extensive efforts to comply with Settebello’s requests to reduce noise, including removing equipment on their shared wall and turning off music in the store.“We really are trying to be a good neighbor,” said Fabis, adding that if the noise complaints continue, Burdick’s may have to shut down temporarily to build a soundproof wall.Levin confirmed that some photographs were taken of the café by someone associated with Settebello but refused to reveal the photographer’s identity. He also said that the purpose of the photographs was “a lot more innocuous” than people at Burdick’s had said.According to Cambridge License Commission Executive Officer Elizabeth Y. Lint, Levin sent in pictures of the café last week and made a phone call complaining about Burdick’s violation of capacity.Lint said that in response, she sent in an investigator to inspect the café but did not find that it was over capacity.Currently, Burdick’s is licensed by the City of Cambridge to have 16 people in the store, a number it regularly exceeds during holidays and busier hours, said Napier.According to Fabis, Burdick’s is looking to begin a petition in the store to garner community support to expand its capacity. Lint said she imagined their application would be successful.Fabis said that the continuous conflict with Settebello has become a nuisance. “In economic times like these, it’s disconcerting that a fellow small business owner is putting so much pressure on us.”Fabis added that she did not understand the logic behind Settebello’s complaints. “Settebello should be thrilled that there’s a busy café next to them. We bring foot traffic to them.”—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of this week’s budget cuts at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University Dining Services will eliminate most hot breakfast options in House dining halls beginning in the fall, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced Monday.The cut comes in response to the College’s decision to lower the board rate students pay by 7.5 percent, as it seeks to devote more money to its “core mission”, according to HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin.The reductions in hot breakfast will save the College $900,000 a year, HUDS Executive Director Ted A. Mayer told students at a forum Monday night. Annenberg will still serve prepared breakfast to all students, and administrators emphasized that the cost savings will allow for a 40 percent increase in the budget for brain break.Only 30 percent of students eat breakfast and many of those do not eat the prepared items, Mayer, meaning the effects of the breakfast changes should be minimal.“You got it at Annenberg, and a transfer of funds to brain break; you’ve got protein, and weekends are the same,” Mayer said. “I’d think that’s adequate for you to maintain diet and strength.”The improved brain break will include new items such as hummus and pita, cheese and crackers, and make-your-own cupcakes. Though some of those improvements have previously been seen in certain Houses, these changes will be implemented in all dining halls, according to Martin.Adams House Food Literacy Program Representative Kelly A. Evans ’10 said that she is concerned about health implications that HUDS may not have taken into account.“The same values of protein and carbohydrates will be available but not in sources that people enjoy,” Evans said. “If they’re trying to promote healthiest lifestyle and eating breakfast is a part of that, it may be that reducing options is harmful in general.”A portion of the cost savings will come from cutbacks in staff, though Martin wrote in an e-mailed statement that HUDS will seek to keep “as many jobs as possible.”Some varsity athletes who regularly eat breakfast after early morning practices are concerned they will be disproportionately affected by the elimination of hot foods.As they ate omelettes in Eliot dining hall yesterday morning, rowers Emily B. Walker ’11 and Laurel J. Gabard-Durnam ’10 said they believe that limited breakfast options will almost certainly affect their performance on the water. “If Harvard doesn’t win at Harvard-Yale next year, we’ll know why,” Walker said, referring to the annual regatta. Gabard-Durnam added, “Yale has breakfast.”—Staff writer William N. White can be reached at wwhite@fas.harvard.edu.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
Today's VOID post suffered a budget cut. Play around with the graphic or something.

While The Crimson's home page is covered head to toe in doom and gloom-- the Yale Daily News has had merrier news to report. Over their front page?  Their web site has gone all-out to report that planning for their two new Residential Colleges (the equivalent to Harvard's Houses) is going forward, and they even have architectural designs now. The sketches look like they're straight out of the Middle Ages, and FlyBy cannot tell a lie: they look pretty cool.
Harvard's taken the more conservative route in planning to gut out current Houses from the inside rather than build entirely new ones--which is convenient in retrospect, they wouldn't have been able to pay for shuttle service to and from those new Houses anyway.  But when this "House renewal" project will emerge is unclear. First the plan was to launch the renewal as early as 2011.  Then the promise changed to "as early as 2012." In an interview on Monday, Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith emphasized the uncertainty embedded in that promise:
So...by 2012, students may not even know when House renewal is supposed to start. Those Gothic spires are standing out more clearly in the distance.

FlyBy donned our Sunday best every day last week while heading to each house's spring formal. Our guide to the balls being inadequate, a more thorough investigation was necessary.  Below: Leverett, Dunster and Quincy.
Leverett: 
Leverett has never been known as a “cool” house, so when its HoCo tossed aside plans for an ultra-fancy formal at the top of Boston’s Prudential Center in favor of a standard in-house affair, you can understand why some (FlyBy among them) thought it would be business as usual in everyone’s favorite pit stop on the way to fun in Mather.
But those who decided to pass up Lev’s “Casablanca”-themed spring formal haven’t been paying enough attention, because things at Mill and Dewolfe have been different as of late. If Leverett’s open-list spat over its formal location showed anything, it was that, for the first time in FlyBy’s memory, more than a handful of people actually cared about the going-ons of Leverett. And as it turns out, when people actually care about the house, it can be a pretty cool place—or at least throw a pretty cool formal.
FlyBy gives the Lev HoCo some major props for its creative and varied use of house space. Matted stills from the classic 1942 film lined the walls connecting the formal’s three main areas, each of which had a decidedly different feel. Those looking for the typical Harvard dance experience—i.e., sweaty writhing in a dark room with DJ Straus—found what they wanted in the Lev Old Library. Across the hall in the JCR, formal-goers enjoyed a tasty chocolate fountain while random revelers, presumably aided by the free-flowing open bar (FlyBy and friends had no problem doubling up on drinks), struck up tunes on the piano.
But the real heart of the formal was the outdoor tent in the courtyard, which housed said open bar, a handful of small dining tables, and a light jazz band that made up for not being good by…well, just being there. (The swing-dancing couples didn’t seem to care who was playing, anyway.) And while some cost-cutting measures were evident—note to Lev HoCo: FlyBy could recognize that second-rate HUDS hummus and tabouli anywhere—the 510 students who purchased tickets got to experience something entirely new: for one night, at least, Leverett was cool.
Jump, for more.
Dunster:
Fête. Bacchanalia. Hell, we’ll even throw in Mather Lather (it’s close enough to formal season). These signature House dances help define their homes.
Dunster’s HoCo was apparently attempting to give the House a trademark event of its own in naming this year’s formal—Beltane.
At first, Beltane, a historic festival in May, seemed a fitting choice. Formals are in May! Indeed, Beltane is an ancient Gaelic celebration that occurs on the first of May. Combined with the barbaric Goat Roast, maybe Beltane could be the perfect choice for an enduring Dunster formal name, assuming the ladies don’t mind bringing dates donning kilts and Braveheart war paint.
However, as FlyBy conducted a more thorough investigation of this pagan festival, HoCo’s reasoning began to unravel. Beltane involved Druids and otherworldly spirits back in the day. Today, Wiccans celebrate this ritualistic jamboree. What the eff? Message to Dunster HoCo: just because a holiday occurs in May, it is not necessarily an appropriate formal theme. As delightful as wearing maternity dresses to a Mother’s Day-inspired formal would be, something just doesn’t sit right with Beltane.
Nevertheless, the outlandish theme didn’t seem to deter partygoers. From the very beginning of sold-out Beltane to its 1:30 AM final song, the dance floor was tightly packed. Unfortunately, these close quarters inspired minimal Moose promiscuity, as overly bright lighting revealed all. Still, Dunster’s dark tunnels managed to provide a more intimate setting for those who sought a bit of escalation.
The DJ balanced Top 40 and 80s and 90s throwback music quite well. Though it teetered towards wedding/prom at times, hardly anyone left the floor except to hit up the well-stocked (and well-attended) open bar, including the Dunster tutors, who raged hard alongside students the entire night.
Décor and food were pretty standard. Given the formal’s name, FlyBy expected to eat Celtic dishes, light bonfires for druidic sacrifices, and practice witchcraft with cauldrons. Beyond one Dunsterite spotted in a kilt, most stuck to the usual formal garb. But maybe HoCo should find this a blessing in disguise. Rather than reflecting its batshit theme, Dunster’s Beltane was a solid night likely to remembered (or not) by many.
Quincy:
Unlike the rest of its river house brethren, Quincy House’s formal was devoid of grassy lawns, temporary tents and chocolate fountains.  Instead, it was hosted at The Estate, a nightclub in the center of Boston.  This is the fourth time that Flyby has been at the Estate in the past three weeks between sorority formals and the Red Party, so Q-Ball had to impress in order to rise above the rest.
FlyBy loved the club atmosphere: you know, velvet booths, club lighting, smoke machines, gyrating bodies on the dance floor, and hot bartenders in sheer tops.   Q-ball was able to outdo the other recent events in The Estate by opening up the top floor so attendees could overlook the dance floor while grinding with a little less sweat and a little more privacy than on the lower floor.  Even the VIP lounge was open, where FlyBy went to rest our feet from all the dancing.
Even though Q-ball was widely advertised to have an open bar, the only drinks available free of charge were wine and beer.  There was also fingerfood like cheese and crackers and meat on sticks, but they seemed out of place and less than appetizing amidst the dim club lighting and the loud bass.
The music started out well mixed, but later it seemed as if the formal had fallen into a time warp to the 80s.  After the DJ played Metallica, Bon Jovi, Aint No Mountain High Enough, Michael Jackson, Def Leppard, Jessie’s Girl and Bon Jovi again, FlyBy just wanted to go home.  And speaking of getting home, while the yellow school bus shuttle service meant not having to pay for a cab, it was a yellow school bus.  Yeah. Flashbacks to middle school included.
Overall, Quincy House threw a pretty baller ball.  The estate was a much needed departure from traditional House Formals,  and FlyBy hopes that more Houses will venture outside their courtyards next year.
