After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than three-quarters of Harvard’s tenured Anthropology faculty asked professor John L. Comaroff to resign over sexual harassment allegations on Sunday.
In a three-sentence letter sent to Comaroff on Sunday evening, 15 Anthropology professors — including the department’s chair — wrote that they had “lost confidence” in him as a professor.
The letter comes amid growing furor over sexual harassment allegations against Comaroff, who was placed on unpaid leave by Harvard last month.
“We have lost confidence in your ability to be a teacher, mentor, colleague, and productive member of our department,” the letter said. “We believe that your continued presence undercuts our viability as a unit and impedes our efforts to build a more safe, responsive, and responsible community.”
Comaroff denies the allegations of misconduct.
“I am deeply distressed that my colleagues have taken this stance in the face of Harvard’s own findings and processes,” he wrote in a statement Sunday.
The letter was sent to Comaroff just after 5 p.m. on Sunday by the Harvard Anthropology Department’s chair, Ajantha Subramanian, who provided it to The Crimson in response to a related inquiry.
The Sunday letter was signed by 14 other faculty members: David Carrasco, Lucien Castaing-Taylor, Steven C. Caton, Gabriella Coleman, William L. Fash, Rowan K. Flad, Joseph P. Gone ’92, Byron J. Good, Nicholas H. Harkness, Arthur M. Kleinman, Matthew Liebmann, Peter Der Manuelian ’81, Michael J. Puett, and Jason A. Ur.
The senior faculty who organized the letter were unable to reach some tenured faculty members about their support for the statement before it was sent, Subramanian said.
Earlier this month, three Anthropology graduate students filed a federal lawsuit against Harvard alleging that the school ignored years of sexual misconduct complaints against Comaroff, a professor of African and African American Studies and Anthropology. The suit outlined a decade of sexual harassment and professional retaliation allegations against Comaroff, who was not named as a defendant.
Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay sanctioned Comaroff last month after University investigations found that he violated the the school’s sexual harassment and professional misconduct policies. Comaroff is barred from advising additional students and teaching required courses through the next academic year.
In a statement Sunday, Comaroff’s lawyers — Janet E. Halley, Norman S. Zalkind, and Ruth O’Meara Costello ’02 — called the letter a “moral panic.” They wrote that Harvard has “exhaustively investigated” allegations against Comaroff and disciplined him according to its findings.
“This was a lengthy process in which the complainants had extensive opportunities to be heard and to present evidence,” the attorneys wrote. “The lawsuit’s claims are unproven, and its most serious allegations were found, in Harvard’s multiple investigations, to be unsupported by the evidence. A moral panic is no substitute for a fair process.”
The Anthropology Department has been roiled by allegations of gender-based harassment in recent years. In May 2020, The Crimson reported on sexual harassment allegations against three prominent professors in the department, including Comaroff.
“We are calling on Professor Comaroff to resign from the Anthropology department because we believe that his return to our department after his administrative leave will undermine our sustained efforts to rebuild trust and create a safe and supportive learning environment,” Subramanian, the Anthropology chair, wrote in an email Sunday.
In the nearly two weeks since the lawsuit was filed, Comaroff has lost the support of many Harvard faculty, including some who initially defended him. Earlier this month, 35 faculty members retracted their support for a letter they had signed just days before that questioned the results of misconduct investigations into Comaroff.
The FAS first placed Comaroff on paid administrative leave in August 2020 after The Crimson reported that at least three female students had been in touch with Harvard’s Title IX office about allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation by Comaroff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Noah Kirkwood secured the rebound and the thousand-plus fans at Lavietes Pavilion breathed a huge sigh of relief as Harvard earned a gritty victory over Cornell on Saturday, squeaking past the Big Red 77-72 in overtime to avenge its loss in Ithaca last month and stay in the hunt for the fourth and final spot in the Ivy League Tournament.
The Crimson (13-10, 5-6 Ivy League) led for almost the entire game and by as many as 19 points before an 18-0 Cornell run allowed the Big Red (13-10, 5-7 Ivy) to take their first lead of the game with three minutes left. But Harvard made enough stops and Kirkwood enough plays to send the game to overtime, and the Crimson controlled the extra session from start to finish.
“There’s never a dull moment in the Ivy League,” said head coach Tommy Amaker. “So many chances — not even talking about being up by a lot, to win the game there — but even when it got tight, so many shots and opportunities, and it was crazy.”
The final few minutes of regulation were extremely tense. Both teams missed critical free throws down the stretch, and the final 2:30 of regulation featured three ties and a chance for both teams to win the game in the final few seconds. A missed layup by freshman guard Evan Nelson and an errant half court heave by Cornell’s Dean Noll sent the game to overtime, where Harvard won the tip, got a quick layup from Kirkwood, and never looked back.
It was only fitting that a Kirkwood rebound sealed the game for the Crimson. The senior guard and the Ivy League’s third leading scorer led the way throughout, pacing Harvard with 31 efficient points, eight rebounds, four assists, and two steals. Kirkwood excelled despite clearly being Cornell’s main defensive priority. The Ottawa, Ont., native has faced his fair share of double teams this season, but the Big Red doubled him more frequently and earlier in the shot clock than any team the Crimson had yet faced.
“I’ve seen double teams usually in the post or maybe along the wing,” said Kirkwood, “But I was even so high up near half court almost and they were doubling. So when that happens, I think that’s beneficial to us because then we play four on three.”
While Kirkwood was held in check during Cornell’s run, he came through down the stretch, hitting a jumper to knot the game at 62 and end a nine minute stretch without a Harvard basket before adding four points in overtime, when he was finally able to get out in transition and find the space that the Big Red was so adamant to deny him.
“What are you going to say about Kirkwood?” asked Amaker rhetorically. “His production throughout the game was just tremendous, and he made every right play and decision. Even when they were doubling him he found the open guys and I was just really pleased with his performance. He was the best player on the floor.”
The Crimson lit it up offensively in the first half, hitting seven threes and shooting 65 percent from the floor as Harvard entered the break up 43-26. Junior guard Luka Sakota matched his Ivy League season high with 18 points, while senior forward Kale Catchings added 10 points and three enormous offensive rebounds.
Cornell, meanwhile, looked largely listless in the first half after traveling from Hanover, where it suffered a disheartening defeat to Dartmouth on Friday night. But even after the Crimson jumped out to a big lead, the specter of a big comeback always loomed because of Cornell’s propensity to push the ball in transition and score points in a hurry. The Big Red’s depth and playing style has allowed it to average over 80 points per game and rank in the top 10 in pace nationally.
“Cornell was battling and fighting and we knew, no matter what lead we had, that they’re going to have opportunities because of their style,” said Amaker. “It’s just hard to — you can’t simulate that, and once they see the thing starting to go downhill a little bit, it’s hard to stop them. So you give them all the credit in the world for how hard they played to get back in it and to take the lead.”
Harvard’s lack of depth, due in large part to the rash of injuries that befell the team this year and particularly in recent weeks, was nearly decisive. Cornell played 13 players and won the points off the bench battle 45 to nine. The Big Red, one of the highest-frequency three-point shooting teams in the country, took over half of its shots from long range but never really gained momentum from beyond the arc. Yet Cornell found plenty of room to maneuver inside the paint, winning the points in the paint battle 40-22 and shooting a stellar 75 percent from two-point range as the Big Red continued to limit its attempts from midrange.
“That’s one of their strengths, being able to play so deep into their roster,” said senior center Mason Forbes. “And that’s something that can become taxing on you that they have so many subs that they can put in there, but I feel like we handled it pretty well throughout the game.”
The Crimson will not get many style points for its victory on Saturday, but the win nevertheless propels it to fourth in the Ivy League, a half-game ahead of Cornell. A monumental home-and-home against Princeton (19-5, 9-2 Ivy), which knocked off Yale on Saturday to pull into a tie atop the conference, awaits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As some of the world’s greatest athletes descended upon Beijing, China, for the Winter Olympics between Feb. 4 and Feb. 20, some of Harvard’s brightest stars were among them.
Nick Abruzzese ’23 and Sean Farrell ’24 made significant contributions to a U.S. Men's Ice Hockey team that, although it was upset in the first knockout stage by Slovakia, went undefeated through its group. Keely Moy ’22 played on a Swiss Women’s Ice Hockey team that finished tantalizingly close to a medal in fourth. Meanwhile, Remi Drolet ’24 became just the third skier to represent Harvard at the Olympics, and the first for Team Canada. But it was Emerance Maschmeyer ’16 who shined the brightest, claiming the gold medal for Canada in Women’s Ice Hockey.
Harvard’s Nick Abruzzese and Sean Farrell had impressive performances at the Beijing Winter Olympics, recording several goals and assists for Team USA’s ice hockey team.
In their first match during the group stages, Team USA swept China 8-0 and saved a total of 29 goals. During his first match, junior forward Abruzzese produced two assists, two total shots, and played for 16:06. Sophomore forward Farrell, meanwhile, had a terrific performance, scoring on all of his three shots. Farrell also provided two assists, while playing for only 11:40.
Team USA defeated Canada 4-2 in their second match in the group stage. Team USA saved 35 shots and attempted 27 shots in total. Abruzzese played for a total of 16:10 and attempted a total of 2 shots, making neither. Farrell provided one assist, playing for a total of 12:34.
During their final match of the group stage, Team USA defeated Germany in a close game of 3-2 despite having a total of 12 minutes in penalty. Team USA saved 24 shots and attempted 32 shots. During their powerplay, Team USA managed to score a goal. Abruzzese provided one assist and attempted three total shots, although he did not score. Farrell, on the other hand, did not contribute as much as Abruzzese, receiving 21 shifts and playing for a total time of 20:23
In an upset, USA lost to Slovakia 2-3 in the first knockout stage game. Although they had 6:38 in powerplay, they were unable to capitalize on their advantage. Abruzzese, however, scored his first goal, and played for a total time of 18:40. Farrell provided zero goals and zero assists, playing for a total time of 20:23
Emerance Maschmeyer, who was the goaltender for the Ice Hockey team during her years at Harvard, won the gold medal for her country, Canada, at this year’s Beijing Winter Olympics 2022.
With 22 saves throughout the tournament, and with her team going on an unbeaten streak till the final, where they claimed the gold medal by winning against USA, she made all her teammates and all of Harvard proud of her achievements and accolades.
During her time playing for the Crimson, she was the all-time leader in saves for the team, with 2,538 through the course of her four years, and also served as co-captain of the team during her senior year.
Current senior at the College and forward for the Crimson, Keely Moy had the honor of representing her home country, Switzerland, in Beijing. Contributing 7 shots and an assist to her country, she helped them reach the semi finals, where they lost to eventual champions Canada, ultimately finishing in 4th.
These past few weeks, sophomore nordic skier Remi Drolet made the Harvard Crimson proud as he competed at the 2022 Beijing Olympics for the Canadian national team. In the men’s 15 km classic, he finished in a time of 41:07.7, good for 33rd place. Drolet also helped Canada to an 11th place result in the 4x10 km relay (2:04:01.1). He competed in the 50 km, which was shortened to 30 km due to high winds, and finished 35th, in a time of 1:16:27.1. Drolet also came 57th in the skiathlon. The Rossland, B.C., native, who is only the third skier to represent the Crimson at the Olympics, the first since 1984, and the first Canadian, already has his eyes set on the 2026 Olympics in Milan and Cortina D’Ampezzo, where he hopes to continue his run of success.
