After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of book lovers filled up the pews in the Old South Church in Copley Square on Friday, October 28, to attend a talk by author, journalist, and headliner of the Boston Book Festival Patrick Radden Keefe.
Keefe is a writer for the New Yorker and the author of several best-selling books, including “Empire of Pain” (2021) and “Say Nothing” (2018). At the talk in the Old South Church, he focused mostly on his new book, “Rogue: True Stories of Grifters, Killers, Rebels and Crooks,” an anthology of twelve stories of Keefe’s published over the last decade in the New Yorker.
At the start of the event, Deborah Z. Porter, founder of the Boston Book Festival, welcomed the Festival’s first in-person audience since 2019 and introduced Keefe onto the stage.
“It feels a little like the first one ever, where we don't really know what's going to happen,” Porter said about the planning of the event.
Keefe described himself as a “writer who likes to borrow from fiction, but tell true stories.” His talk, his advice, his reasoning — they were all given in the form of stories. He began by talking about the writing of one of the pieces in his book about the Mexican drug lord El Chapo. According to Keefe, after he wrote this story, he got a call from one of El Chapo's lawyers, asking Keefe if he would ghostwrite El Chapo's autobiography. Keefe declined, worried it may put him into a dangerous situation given El Chapo’s violent history.
These stories seemed to keep the audience fully engaged. The talk was humorous and enlightening at the same time.
“It’s nice to hear people who are funny and personable, but they talk about craft,” Sarah L. Lee ’99 said. Lee knew about Keefe from his previous works, and is also a big fan of the Boston Book Festival. She has been a consistent attendee since 2013.
Keefe was interviewed for part of the event by Meghna Chakrabarti, host of NPR’s “On Point.” She asked about his choice of title, his reasoning for publishing the collection, his observation skills, and what moments he looks for to develop the characters in his stories.
“It's fun to see both Keefe and Meghna in person when I’m so used to hearing their voices,“ audience member Zoe R. Weinrobe said, referring to Keefe’s podcast “Wind of Change” and Chakrabarti’s radio hosting.
One of Keefe’s main points throughout his talk and in his writing was his attempt to see even the worst people as multi-dimensional humans. To explain this belief, he offered a story about a death row lawyer he met through reporting. This lawyer, he said, agreed to work with only the worst of the worst cases, representing the defendant in the Boston Marathon bombing, for instance.
“So it's one of her articles of faith that we aren’t born evil, that none of us are born evil, things happen to us along the way. And I don't know that I would take it to the extreme that she does,” he said, “but as a writer, I'm most interested in how people can deviate from conventional morality, how it happens by degree and then the stories that they tell themselves about what they're doing.”
His books, he says, come from stories he wrote for the New Yorker that still feel incomplete at a length of 10,000 words. For example, his true crime book “The Snakehead'' is about a woman who smuggled people into the United States from China, then was arrested by the FBI.
Porter said that Keefe was chosen by the nonfiction committee for the Boston Book Festival because of the release of “Rogue,” his most recent book. When they suggested the idea to her, she didn’t believe that they would be able to get him to speak — but she reached out to his publishers and made it work.
“It was very exciting,” she said.
Keefe has ties to the Boston area too: He was raised in Dorchester. He said growing up in Boston helped him learn how to connect with the people he reports on and gain their trust.
“I do think that Boston's kind of weird mix of different cultures, the fusty blue blooded culture and the academic culture, the blue collar culture, and the immigrant cultures, all kinds of money together,” he said. “I like to think that that equipped me to just move through the world and try to find common ground with strangers everyday.”

Kirkland House senior Arda Cataltepe ’23 died on Friday after a prolonged illness, according to announcements sent by the College Saturday.
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana announced Cataltepe’s death in an email to College students and staff Saturday afternoon after speaking with the student’s family.
“Arda was a remarkable person,” Khurana wrote. “His family told me that he was emailing his teachers even hours before his passing. Arda cared about environmental sustainability and was passionate about the NBA. His brief life reminds us of how precious life is and the importance of gratefulness for each other.”
An Applied Math and Economics concentrator, Cataltepe served as president of Harvard Consulting on Business and the Environment, a strategy consulting club. He was a 2019 graduate of Weston High School in Weston, Massachusetts.
Kirkland House Faculty Deans David J. Deming and Janine Santimauro and Resident Dean Jack Huguley called Cataltepe a “gentle soul” in an announcement to Kirkland residents sent prior to Khurana’s email.
“We are heartbroken. Arda was a member of our Kirkland community, and his passing is a loss for all of us,” they wrote. “In difficult times, a community comes together to grieve and to share strength.”
Khurana and the Kirkland deans encouraged students to attend a gathering in the Senior Common Room at 7 p.m. on Sunday for support in light of the announcement.
“Arda’s passing leaves a hole in our hearts and community,” Khurana wrote. “It is important to remember that loss impacts each of us differently, and there is no right way to mourn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to Harvard head coach Tim Murphy, football is a "game of inches". During Saturday’s game between Harvard (5-3, 3-2) and Columbia (4-4, 1-4), the Crimson needed just a few more inches. After opting to kick a 42-yard field goal down by one on fourth and one with just over a minute remaining, Murphy’s faith in his senior kicker, Jonah Lipel, was not rewarded. Instead, a Lions defender got a fingertip on the football, which veered left and clanked off the left upright, shattering the hopes of Harvard’s players and the hearts of the fans who had gathered on a balmy fall afternoon to watch the team play. The 21-20 victory was Columbia’s first at Harvard Stadium since a 28-24 win on Sept. 16, 1995.
“Just really one of those days where it came down to a play here and there, a spot here and there, getting a first down. Just very, very frustrating,” Murphy said.
Entering the contest, the Crimson were tied for second in the Ivy League, likely needing to win out and Princeton to lose once to share the conference title. Saturday’s slate did no favors for the Crimson. In addition to putting its own Ivy League hopes on thin ice with the defeat, it received none of the other three results it needed to keep pace. 2021 co-champion Dartmouth continued its hellish season by dropping a 17-14 contest to the Tigers, who put themselves just two victories away from their 14th Ivy League championship. Penn, who will host the Crimson in Philadelphia next weekend, kept pace on Saturday by topping Cornell, 28-21. And the biggest surprise of the day came from Yale, which also improved its Ivy League record to 4-1 by thrashing Brown, 69-17. Harvard has not yet been mathematically eliminated, but it will need victories over both the Quakers and Bulldogs, while Princeton must lose to Yale and then Penn.
Nothing came easy for Harvard in the early going. The first play from scrimmage was perhaps a harbinger of things to come, as Dean’s pass was tipped at the line. Although the quarterback caught his own pass for a short gain, it would be indicative of his struggles to get much moving through the air. His second passing attempt was also tipped at the line and intercepted by Lions middle linebacker Scott Valentas. Except for a few long catch-and-runs by first-year wide receiver Cooper Barkate, a former top recruit out of Mater Dei (Calif.), the Crimson passing offense struggled until the final drive, as the hosts were without senior wide receiver Kym Wimberly and sophomore wide receiver Ledger Hatch, each of whom missed the contest with an injury. Without them, Barkate was a lone bright spot, hauling in five passes for 102 yards.
“I thought [Barkate] was one example,” said Murphy of players who helped fill the void left by Wimberly and Hatch. “[He] did an outstanding job for a true freshman, because his knowledge and reps haven’t been that great until the last couple of weeks.”
Despite punting on two of its open three possessions, Harvard struck paydirt on its second drive, embarking on a eight-play, 60-yard march into the wind and down the field. The Crimson’s first explosive play of the game came on this possession, a 49-yard catch and run by Barkate. He high-pointed a slightly overthrown pass by Dean before racing down the left sideline as his defender fell. A few plays later, Dean hit senior tight end Haven Montefalco for a back-shoulder fade in the left side of the end zone. The Indianapolis native has been used primarily as a blocking tight end this season, allowing junior tight end Tyler Neville to establish himself as a threat in the passing game. On Saturday, Montefalco caught his eighth pass, and second touchdown of the season.
Harvard’s only other offensive touchdown of the game came in the second quarter, mostly on the strength of senior running back Aidan Borguet. After Columbia wide receiver Bryson Canty’s six-yard back shoulder fade gave the Lions a 10-7 lead, the Crimson answered with a nine-play, 72-yard scoring drive that included a 22-yard completion to senior wide receiver Joe Young, which was his first reception since 2019. Borguet ultimately finished off the drive by plunging into the end zone from one yard out for his tenth rushing score of the season. Harvard leaned on him heavily all game, as his 23 carries went for 108 yards and the touchdown. After hitting the century mark sixth time this season, the Ivy League’s leading back sits at 1,003 rushing yards, becoming the eighth unique Harvard player to hit the 1,000-yard plateau. He needs 299 yards in the final two contests to supplant Clifton Dawson ’07 as the program’s all-time single season rushing leader, a record Dawson set during his sophomore campaign in 2004.
The third quarter was like a distorted pinball game, with both teams looking disjointed on offense and committing myriad turnovers and penalties. The Lions opened the second half by converting a fourth and inches on Ty’son Edwards’ power run and then using a personal foul by junior defensive tackle Thor Griffith to drive deep into Harvard territory. But then, the Crimson defense struck: Bell’s pass was tipped at the line by sophomore defensive lineman Dominic Young-Smith, allowing senior defensive back Max Jones to come down with it. The pick was just Harvard’s fifth of the season and the first for Jones, who saw his first action of the season in the Princeton contest. It also continued a turnover trend that has plagued the Columbia offense all year, as the Lions entered the game with the worst turnover margin in the Ivy League.
If that wasn’t enough, Bell’s next pass attempt was intercepted as well. After the Crimson went three-and-out, continuing to lose momentum from offensive penalties, the Lions quarterback reared back at midfield and unleashed an arcing bomb on first down. It appeared as if Canty wanted to run a post route, but Bell threw a deep go route into double coverage. The ball was slightly overthrown and senior defensive back Alex Washington came up with his second interception of the season.
But yet again, the Crimson failed to capitalize. Lining up on his own goal line, Borguet narrowly missed being tackled in the end zone for a safety on second down. On third, Dean bounced a pass about five feet in front of Odermann, and Harvard promptly punted the ball right back to the Lions. For the second time in the last three weeks, the Crimson failed to score a touchdown in the second half.
“If you get three takeaways on interceptions, you’ve got to win the game,” Murphy said. “End of story.”
The two teams traded field goals on the next two drives, with each quarterback failing to take advantage of strong field position. The Lions were unable to capitalize on McFadden’s brilliant return, as sophomore running back Malcolm Terry II dropped a third-down screen pass with nothing but green grass in between him and a first down. Then, on Harvard’s possession, senior running back Sone Ntoh took the offense inside the red zone, but Dean missed senior wide receiver Joe Young, who had a step on his defender on a deep post route. After good third-down coverage forced Dean to slide down short of the line to gain, Lipel banged home a 34-yard attempt to extend the Crimson lead back to seven.
The Lions had one more chance to make some noise in the third period, but continued to hand the ball over. On third and long, Green fired a hook route just past the line to gain. It appeared to be caught by tight end Luke Painton, but senior linebacker Kobe Joseph, who had a blocked punt in the win over Cornell on Oct. 7, stripped it out of Painton’s hands to give the Crimson possession. After Dean was brought down just short of the line to gain on a third-down run deep in the red zone, Murphy brought out Lipel to try and extend the Harvard lead to 10.
Then, the Lions’ special teams brilliance commenced, as a defensive lineman reached up and blocked the kick, holding the Crimson off the scoreboard after a promising drive led by Borguet, who notched two explosive plays. The Columbia special teams unit continued to shine and keep the Lions within one score, as the Lions garnered another block on the next Harvard drive. Murphy opted to send Lipel out for a 49-yard field goal attempt into the wind, and with the kicker forced to keep the ball low, a Columbia defender got to it again. Lions junior cornerback Seth Parker then returned the loose ball 20 yards, giving the struggling Bell possession on the Crimson’s 40-yard line.
Thanks to the exploits of Canty and Painton, Bell’s second-half nightmare eased up in the fourth quarter. Playing four-down football, the Lions converted one fourth down on a bullet pass to Canty and then, on a third and six from inside the Crimson 20-yard line, Bell rolled to his right and lofted a ball to Painton, who had slipped past a Harvard defender along the right sideline. Then, sophomore defensive back Riley Jenne jumped offside on the ensuing point-after try. With the ball spotted at the one-yard line, Columbia head coach Al Bagnoli opted to send his offense back out there for a two-point try. Bell made good on his coach’s faith, dumping a short pass to running back Ryan Young, who dove across the line to give the Lions a one-point edge. The call stood on review.
“You’ve got to show some confidence in your kids,” said Columbia head coach Al Bagnoli on his decision to go for two. “It was really just not wanting to be afraid to try to win a game.”
Trailing for the first time all game, Harvard turned to the only constant it has had on offense this season: Borguet. The senior broke off a 15-yard gain down the middle to bring the Crimson over midfield. But when Borguet couldn’t get four yards on third down to move the chains, Columbia had regained momentum. After a timeout, Dean couldn’t find an open target on fourth down and scrambled close to the line to gain – but not past it. The Lions took over possession with just over six minutes to play, clinging to a one-point lead.
“There were many opportunities to change the game, to win the game for us,” said senior defensive lineman and captain Truman Jones about Harvard’s miscues throughout the contest. “We failed on all levels.”
Although the Columbia offense failed to pick up the first down after Young-Smith dragged Edwards down short of the line to gain, its special teams unit came up clutch yet again. Forced to drive 80 yards with just over four minutes to play, offensive coordinator Mickey Fein opted to pass on each of the first three plays. Two of them went to Barkate, whose two receptions on the possession totaled 37 yards. Then, staked to a fourth down and inches on the Lions’ 25, Murphy opted not to go for it, instead sending out Lipel. Columbia’s third blocked kick of the game sealed the deal, sending the visiting sideline into a celebratory frenzy while the Harvard side fell silent.
“When you have an opportunity like that, it’s hard to turn it down if you believe in your guys. Could I have gone for it? Sure,” explained Murphy about his mindset on the fourth-down call. “It would have been just awful not to have an opportunity to actually win the game with the field goal.”
Harvard faces an uphill battle if it wants to finish its season strong, facing two strong opponents in Penn and Yale. The Crimson will hope to lean on its veteran leaders next Saturday as it travels to Philadelphia for the first time since the 2018 season to square off against Penn. In that game, the Crimson prevailed, 29-7, behind a 237-yard rushing performance from a trio of backs, a performance that Borguet and Ntoh will try to replicate. However, if neither Wimberly nor Hatch is unable to rejoin the offense before the end of the season, Murphy will be forced to rely on younger and less experienced targets like Barkate and junior wide receiver Kaedyn Odermann.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore butterfly/backstroke swimmer Abby Carr has proven herself in the pool.  In high school, she garnered an array of awards, including the 2019 and 2020 Potomac Valley Athletic Conference Women’s Swimmer. She continued her success upon arriving in Cambridge, winning the 200-meter butterfly in the Ivy League Championship and placing First Team All-Ivy.
But the Maryland native wanted to serve as an example that athletes can compete off of the field, too. It all started during her freshman year, as she sought to balance her studies, swimming, and her social life.
“When I first came to Harvard, I was dealing with pretty severe imposter syndrome. For me, grappling with all of my goals outside of swimming while balancing athletics was really difficult,” Carr said. “And I had a professor tell me that my essay was really good for an athlete. And that if I had not told [the professor] that I was an athlete, he would have assumed I was a normal student.”
Carr recalled feeling disrespected by her professor’s implications that athletes were less capable of succeeding in the classroom. So, seeking to stand up for her fellow athletes, Carr set her eyes on the Undergraduate Council (UC), Harvard’s former student government, which was dissolved in a referendum in March 2022 and replaced by the Harvard Undergraduate Association (HUA).
“I watched the UC do a lot of good things for the student body,” she said. “But at the same time, I thought that we should have an athlete in there because we represent 18-20% of the student body, and that’s a very specific lifestyle and demographic that wasn’t represented. When they are planning student life events and contributing funding to projects, it can be helpful to have an athlete perspective there.”
Even after the UC was abolished, Carr was not dissuaded. Her longing for an athlete’s perspective in student government inspired her to run in the HUA’s inaugural elections in April. In her campaign, she committed to prioritizing issues pertinent to Harvard’s student-athlete community. Then, during the election, she earned the most votes in the HUA’s ranked-choice voting system, becoming one of the initial members of the organization’s nine-person leadership.
“My first project was really simple. It was making sure every single varsity team had access to the media event,” Carr stated. “Media Day is really important because it’s where we get all of the media that’s going to be presented on social media, and also serves as a form of marketing to the recruits.”
By ensuring equitable access to marketing resources, Carr was able to get each team a variety of content and aid future generations of Crimson athletes.
“The better media Harvard has, the better recruits [it] will get,” she said.
Additionally, she was able to partner with the Student Athlete Advisory Council to create unmanned fueling stations in the athletic complex for athletes to get a bite to eat before or after practice.
“Nutrition helps build muscle, which is super important for those sports like football and rugby,” Carr explained. “It’s also important for the swim team where we’re constantly burning calories that need to be replenished.”
One of Carr’s priorities in the rest of her term is to provide better resources for athletes to succeed academically despite demanding competition and travel schedules, which often cause them to miss class. During the reading period of her freshman winter, Carr had to spend five days away from campus in order to compete in the Minnesota Invitational, where she finished 15th in the 200-yard butterfly.
“It’s not the first time athletes have dealt with less than adequate administrative support for athletic absences,” she said. “But I dealt with it firsthand, and so did members of my team. There was a lot of miscommunication, where professors do not understand what it is like to compete at the highest level. So I thought I should step up and address some of the issues we were seeing.”
The lessons that Carr has learned from her lengthy career as a student-athlete have already aided her in providing perspective to the HUA.
“On a swim team, we all come from different backgrounds, different races, different stories, and different political orientations,” she explained. “And yet, when we’re in the pool, we are expected to put our team before ourselves. That perspective is important for the HUA.”
Additionally, in a sport like swimming, where races can often be won by mere milliseconds, focusing on the milieu and constantly seeking out small ways to improve is paramount. Carr credited much of her success as an athlete – and an administrator – to her ability to learn from constructive criticism.
“The fact that those minute differences in swimming races determine whether you win means that you have to listen to the feedback you’re given,” Carr explained. “Athletics trained me to see feedback [as] a good thing. And that has been very important in HUA as I am learning to navigate administration, the athletic department, and diplomatic relations with all of these different organizations on campus.”
Early in her college career, she has balanced swimming stardom, academic excellence, and her role as a representative of Harvard’s athletic community through persistence, grit, and a passionate personality.
“Abby is one of the most driven and talented people I know,” said a fellow member of the IOP, Michael Oved ’25. “Once she sets her mind to something, it happens, even when adversity is thrown her way.”
This is a sentiment shared by the members of her team.
After making an impact on her community out of the water, Carr is preparing to hop back in the pool, hoping to build off of her stellar first season. The 2022 Ivy League champions open the season on Nov. 5 by welcoming Rutgers to Blodgett Pool.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team played four games over the past two weekends against big contenders in the Ivy League. Of the four matches, the Crimson emerged victorious in only one, and the rest were nail-biters.
In the first match, Harvard (5-13, 4-6 Ivy League) fell short to the Princeton Tigers (16-3, 8-1) in four sets on Friday, October 28, in New Jersey. Going into this game, the Crimson had just come off a loss against Dartmouth, putting an end to its two-game win streak.
Harvard struggled against Princeton in the beginning of the first set, losing five consecutive points, three of which came from service aces. It took a kill from first year outside hitter Brynne Faltinsky assisted by senior captain Bella Almanza to break the Tigers’ streak.
Throughout the rest of the first set, the two teams battled back and forth, exchanging leads, before the Tigers ultimately pulled through to take the first set 25-18. In the second set, the Crimson struck back, taking the set, 25-20, off a kill from Faltinsky. The entire set was a team effort, nevertheless, with great efforts including junior middle hitter Olivia Cooper’s two aces and two kills. Cooper hit three aces on the match, a career-high.
After ending the second set on a high note, Harvard faced challenges in the third, which culminated in a 12-point deficit to end the set. The fourth set was even more of a struggle, with the Crimson falling 14 points behind the Tigers to seal the match.
After this disappointing outcome against Princeton, Harvard bounced back in its next match against Penn (2-18, 1-11) the next day. The sets were all close, with the scoreline never reaching a gap of more than six points. The Quakers took the first set, 25-19, but the Crimson quickly regained its composure and took over the rest of the match, dominating Penn and winning the next three sets. Almanza led the team in kills and assists with 13 and 23, respectively. In addition, junior middle blocker Ava Rauser made a big impact on the game, earning the Crimson another 13 kills: a career-high.
After a victorious Saturday, Harvard returned home to the Malkin Athletic Center the next weekend to duel with Columbia (5-15, 2-9). The Lions lead off the first set, earning themselves a five point lead, 13-8. However, the hosts quickly fought back, not only tying the score but also surpassing Columbia with the help of two kills from Almanza and one from both Rauser and junior outside hitter Katie Vorhies. Despite a back-and-forth fight for the rest of the set, the Crimson eventually fell, 25-21.
The second set proved to be much more successful for Harvard, with Columbia never getting a lead. The Crimson eventually won the second set with a whopping nine point lead, 25-16. The third set saw the return of deadlock and the score being much closer between the two teams. The Crimson and Columbia tied the set at 21-21 before the latter pulled away with a four-point run to win the set. Columbia carried its momentum into the fourth set, even achieving a seven point lead and seemingly taking the set and match. However, the Crimson soon retaliated and managed to claw its way back, tying the Lions once again at 21-21. In the next six points, Columbia regained its footing and took four of them to seal the match with a 25-23 finish.
After this hard-fought loss to the Lions, the Crimson took on Cornell (5-16, 3-9) on its senior night. Three seniors were honored during the game: Almanza, outside attacker Kate Condra, and right-side attacker Jaimie Rao. Condra helped the Crimson overcome Penn, assisting the team with one ace and six digs. Rao played against Dartmouth at the beginning of the season, earning the team two kills, but has not played since due to injury.
The first set got off to a rough start for Harvard, with the Big Red shutting the team out for the first six points of the match, three of which were aces. Harvard eventually caught up, however, and even tied the Big Red 21-21. Just like Columbia, Cornell broke away for a first set result of 25-23 over the Crimson. The second set proved to be more of a struggle for Harvard, as it dropped this bout, 25-17. Harvard was not to go down with a fight, however, as it struck back in the third set by taking it with a six point advantage.
At the beginning of the fourth set, it seemed to be an even battle. However, as the set progressed, Cornell took control, largely in part to a seven point run. With this streak, there was no going back, as the Big Red closed out the match with a 25-14 shutdown.
The Harvard women’s volleyball season, which has faced its fair share of challenges, has two final matches this upcoming weekend. The Crimson is set to face off against Brown (12-9, 8-4) this Friday, November 11th, as well as Yale (19-2, 11-1) the following day. Harvard is ranked fifth in the Ivy League, meaning it falls just one spot short of being in the Ivy League Volleyball Tournament. Brown, Dartmouth, Princeton, and Yale have secured the four spots, with Princeton and Yale being the most likely contenders for the No. 1 seed spot.
