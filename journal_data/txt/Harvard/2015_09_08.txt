After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“It was like going to confession,” Mickey Myers says of her recent StoryCorps interview with her friend Mary Anne Karia. “You wouldn’t know this because you weren’t a Catholic….You walk up the stairs, and then you’re in this little area, and then you go into...the inner sanctum, and you sit down, and they give you water….And you identify yourself, and you have to say how old you are.”
Myers and Karia’s interview was tangentially connected to a new exhibition, “Corita Kent and the Language of Pop,” that opened at the Harvard Art Museums on Sept. 3. StoryCorps, a national oral history project, arrived on campus in a repurposed RV last Friday and stayed through Sunday to facilitate interviews between pairs of Bostonians whose lives have been touched by Kent and her artwork. “[I]n the museum, we have this opportunity to present the visual face of the exhibition, but StoryCorps takes that exhibition and makes it a conversation that people can actually listen to in their cars, in their living rooms, in their kitchens,” says Susan M. Dackerman, curator of prints at the Harvard Art Museums.  “It becomes both more public and more intimate.”
StoryCorps aims to capture testimonials like the one recorded by Myers and Karia, both of whom worked with Kent about 50 years ago and knew her personally: Myers studied under Kent, and Karia served as the printmaker’s studio assistant. The StoryCorps project was a natural fit for the Harvard Art Museums exhibition on Kent and her oeuvre, says Colleen J. Ross, the Director of Marketing and Communications at StoryCorps. “The idea was very much in line with other work that StoryCorps has done in capturing local communities and who lives there,” she says. “The goals were really to augment what was happening in the exhibition to learn about the artist, her life, and her work.”
“Corita Kent and the Language of Pop” features a massive photograph and a model of Kent’s piece “Rainbow Swash,” a massive gas tank located in Dorchester, Mass. and highly visible from the Southeast Expressway. Thick and bright cartoonish brushstrokes drip over the white storage tank, long considered as a major Boston landmark. “Everyone knows the tank, and when they hear her name, of course, that’s what they want to talk about,” Dackerman says. “Doing the StoryCorps recordings actually gives us an opportunity to share with the city other aspects of her production, other stories about her artwork, stories about her life before coming to Boston, and, of course, further explicating stories about the tank.”
The StoryCorps mobile booth, with its rounded edges and burnished steel exterior stamped with the “StoryCorps” decal, is iconic in its own right. Having arrived on campus last Friday, the booth has garnered much attention on the Science Center Plaza, from StoryCorps fans to confused tourists alike. In addition to Myers and Karia, other Cantabrigians and Bostonians scheduled interview times through a form on the Harvard Art Museums website and contributed to the dialogue. “Our mission was to expand [the exhibition] to include local voices,” says Chris Molinksi, Rabb Curatorial Fellow at the Harvard Art Museums.
Watching students pass through the Plaza in between Friday classes, Myers reflects on her time studying with Kent and the role she hopes the exhibition and StoryCorps project will play in visitors’ lives. “The point is that we are of a generation that has had our vitality and our privilege, and it is so affirming to see people who were not alive when Corita was alive, who did not live through the pop era, for whom those advertising slogans are something new,” she says. “To see them...learning about her and...how she put advertising together with social concern and spiritual belief, that is like a culmination. It’s like your kid went to Harvard, except in this case it was my teacher. My teacher went to Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few college students are granted the opportunity to spend their summers working with Grammy-nominated singer-songwriters. Isaac L. Alter ’16 and Jake H. Wilder-Smith ’16, however, can count themselves among that number. For Alter and Wilder-Smith, summer 2015 meant helping Sara Bareilles to compose a score for the musical “Waitress,” which premiered in August at the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and has sold out for the remaining weeks of its run in Cambridge.
Tucked away in the Loeb Experimental Theater, next door to the A.R.T.’s mainstage theater, students in the Harvard-Radcliffe Summer Theater program were hard at work on a different project, staging “Mad Forest,” a play examining the aftermath of the Romanian Revolution. And scattered across campus in libraries and museums, students participated in the Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program (SHARP). They explored the digitization of poetry courses, the curation of museum exhibitions, and translations of Shakespeare’s sonnets.
Staying on campus during the summer allowed students to pursue the arts in a variety of fields not only professionally but also with greater depth. “It’s great to get that kind of experience with high caliber shows, [to] have that in your back pocket in the real world,” Alter says. “[The A.R.T.] is a wonderful place to learn the ropes.” Echoing Alter, Emily E. Bergquist ’18 says that her time on campus this summer facilitated a profound connection to the arts at Harvard. “It was a lot of me standing there in awe of these remarkably talented performers.”
The A.R.T., a professional theater, offers positions to students each summer. Those students assist with show production in fields ranging from dramaturgy to stage management to music. This summer, 15 students from a combination of Harvard and other schools spent their time working on various aspects of “Waitress.” Bergquist and other members of the dramaturgy department worked with writers as they developed and revised the script, organized read-throughs, and produced blocking notes. “I didn’t realize how collaborative it was with the actors,” Bergquist says. “Working through a professional tech and preview process was so valuable, [as well as] being able to see how everything works and how all the puzzle pieces fit together and also watching the show from start to finish get created essentially.”
Through connecting with the cast and exploring behind-the-scenes aspects of “Waitress,” Bergquist gained a deeper attachment to the show. “Certain songs still make me cry. I still laugh at all the jokes even though I know they’re coming. I think because I’ve watched all of the different versions of the show as it existed, I can still go see it now and truly enjoy it,” Bergquist says, reflecting on her experiences as an intern at the A.R.T. this summer. She worked in the dramaturgy department, as the A.R.T. turned “Waitress” into a full-scale musical. The show, based on based the 2007 film by Adrienne Shelly, follows Jenna, a waitress trapped in an abusive marriage who ultimately finds the courage to change her life. “When I think back to the first table read and I think about how the show is now, it’s so different, and it’s really cool to be able to say that I watched that grow and I watched that change,” Bergquist says.
Alter, an A.R.T. music intern, worked extensively with Bareilles to write the songs featured in the musical. “In this musical you get the sense that it’s kind [of] just about everyday life,” he says. “Sara has done such an extraordinary job because she really tailors her songs to the character and the moment the character is in, so you really get the sense that the music is complementing the journey that the show is taking you through.” Alter says that watching the first preview and attending full-cast rehearsals were some of the more memorable moments of the summer. “The first time I saw the show all the way through I remember just crying my eyes out because it was like, ‘Oh my gosh. This show exists, and I in some small way helped it exist,’” Alter says. “Another big moment was towards the beginning when I was sitting in a music rehearsal. I was helping sing some extra parts for the song and the people in the room were Jessie Mueller...Keala Settle...Sara Bareilles and our Music Director Nadia [DiGiallonardo], who’s amazing and playing the piano. I got to sing with those three people and it was just like, whoa. This is a crazy moment. How did I end up here?”
Students also had the opportunity to get more intensely involved with theater this summer through a student-run production. As part of the Harvard-Radcliffe Summer Theater program, they not only staged “Mad Forest” but also became a community. Written by Caryl Churchill and directed by Sam R. Reynolds ’16, “Mad Forest” examines life before, during, and after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. The production opened on July 17 and ran through August 2 at the Loeb Experimental Theater.

Having peers around without the pressures of academics, extracurriculars, and the typical social buzz of campus facilitates a special closeness, says Caro P. Ribeiro ’18, who participated in the production. “There’s more of a tight-knit community during the summer,” she says. “During the term time there’s like 20 different shows going up, so it’s very difficult to meet people who aren’t in the same cast as you. But since there’s only one show going on during the summer everyone kind of bonds together, which is really, really nice. I really like that.”
For Nadia L. Urrea ’17, who was part of the “Mad Forest” cast, participating in summer theater was a chance to engage in the drama world during a less stressful time of year. “This year I was really busy, so I wasn’t able to do much theater. So I really wanted to do something this summer,” Urrea says. “I knew about the summer theater program...and so I decided that I would audition.”
The summer production schedule also allows students to more actively engage in the subject matter, Ribeiro says. “Our directors have done a great job creating the world of the show and the world of the characters and the Romanian Revolution, and I think that for people who aren’t familiar with the time period, it’s a great opportunity to learn more about a country’s history that we don’t often hear about,” she says.
Alona R. Bach ’16 stared at a cardboard box filled to the brim with vintage lantern slides. Wearing purple latex gloves and handling the broken ones with care, she sorted through the box, organizing the materials based on shared characteristics. The slides, which numbered more than 900, dated to the 1960s classroom of former Harvard chemistry professor Eugene G. Rochow. “I find myself looking at objects a lot,” Bach says. “I was interested in museums before but spending the summer working in a collection just cemented that desire. Really getting to see how it works is fantastic.”
Elsewhere on campus, Colin D. Criss ’17 built HTML code and used video editing software to design “Poetry of the City: Walt Whitman,” an upcoming for-credit online course at the Graduate School of Education. Under the direction of English professor Elisa New, Criss studied how poems can be visually represented and can shape class discussion. “[I was] directed by core humanist questions,” Criss says. “How do you represent poetic images?.... The question there is how do you teach poetry so that it can be taught? How do you give those teachers skills? Communicating an idea and representing an idea... It’s hard.”
Bach and Criss were three of 13 students who participated in the Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program at the College (SHARP), an immersive summer experience that enabled them to conduct research projects in those fields. The program, which has grown considerably since its inception in 2013, pairs students with faculty members to pursue specific arts-related research projects, ranging from curatorial work at museums to preparing materials for a professor’s upcoming book. “We owe this [expansion] to a rise not only in student interest but also to the enthusiastic response from faculty who want to be a part of the program,” writes Jeffrey Berg, assistant director at the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, in an email. “Research takes on many forms in SHARP and the nature of the projects vary widely,” he says. “The great benefit to fellows across all programs is that they all live together under one roof. Social and intellectual programming fosters interesting interdisciplinary conversations and even collaborations.”
“SHARP aims to expose students to the wide range of exciting ideas and research interests that are being explored across the arts and humanities and beyond,” Berg writes. “We define the scope of projects very broadly.... You probably wouldn’t immediately associate ‘scientific instruments’ with arts and humanities research, but those fascinating intersections are what make SHARP so very exciting and unique,” he adds. For Bach, for example, the lantern slide research was only one element of her summer experience at the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments (CHSI). She primarily worked on CHSI’s upcoming exhibition titled “The Golden Age of Radio,” which chronicles the history, technology, and culture surrounding the radio.
Bach and her co-intern conducted research, chose objects for the gallery, and made detailed design plans for the space. Bach, who studied abroad in London last semester and frequented the city’s many museums and galleries, says she applied to work at the Collection to learn more about museums. “We learned a lot about what the considerations are when developing exhibits… There are aesthetic considerations, like, ‘This is a colorful radio. This [one] represents a specific time period.’” Bach’s CHSI experience also reaffirmed her interest in curatorial work. “It was really valuable to me in terms of giving me a peek into a career that I really wanted to pursue.”
Criss says he also had an immersive experience in Cambridge this summer, an internship that changed the way he looks at the world. “I guess the most powerful thing I’ve taken from my SHARP experience is the way the humanities can be incorporated into everything in life,” he says.
Whether students worked in the theater, the museum, or the lab, their summers provided the necessary time to delve more deeply into the arts and humanities and explore their intersections with related and unrelated fields. Moreover, the summer enabled students to reflect on their lives and the role that art should play, professionally and personally, they said.
“I feel very comfortable bringing poetry up with my friends and family now,” Criss says. “I’m very comfortable saying...‘That reminds me of a poem. Do you mind if I read it?’....I started to incorporate humanities in my life and that was the most valuable [takeaway] from this summer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The image commonly presented of Corita Kent is unconventional when compared to that of most pop artists: She most frequently appears as a nun dressed in black habit working in a convent. And while this is a picture that might contain some truth, it is not what the Harvard Art Museums hope to show with their special exhibition “Corita Kent and the Language of Pop.” Running from Sep. 3 to Jan. 3, the exhibit juxtaposes Kent’s works against those of her contemporaries as it seeks to present an unfamiliar perspective on her art.
The exhibit spans around a decade of Kent’s creative output with six galleries that focus on different aspects of her work from 1964 to 1971, including her use of traffic as inspiration and her interest in Del Monte’s tomatoes. According to Susan M. Dackerman, the exhibition’s curator, in the ’60s Kent was mostly engaged with the artistic and political society around her and endowed her creations with great potency. The decade also aligns with the Second Vatican Council, a series of meetings in which the Catholic Church adapted its practices to a modern world—an interest in modernization that also deeply affected Kent. “Corita Kent was very much interested in making those kinds of updates to Catholic liturgy...in order to make Catholicism more accessible to its participants,” Dackerman says.
GSAS student Eva B. Payne, a curatorial intern for the exhibit and the speaker on Vatican II at the exhibition’s public opening panel, agrees. “I really do see [Kent] translating and extricating Vatican II for a modern artist,” she says. “She took this language of the supermarket...that was...the vernacular of the people to rethink religious messages.”
As its name suggests, “Corita Kent and the Language of Pop” concerns itself with words rather than images; for instance, prints include phrases and slogans such as “Power Up” and “Makes meatball sing.” Dackerman says that this interest in text comes not only from the fact that words and phrases comprise a majority of Kent’s works until the late 1960s but also from the artist’s general fascination with words. “She loved [words] not just because they convey meaning but because they have a certain resonance and a certain power,” says Harvey G. Cox, Jr., a professor at the Harvard Divinity School and friend of the late Kent.
These elements combine to offer a novel viewpoint on Kent. Rather than focus on her biography as a nun making pop art, the Harvard Art Museums want to present Kent through another lens by carefully placing her art against that of her contemporaries to show the discourse among the artists. “[Her work] doesn’t come out of a vacuum,” Dackerman says. “It comes out of a dialogue with these other artists...who have these art history stories that have been built around them. We wanted to make an art history story for her as well.”
Beyond examining Kent with an art historical perspective, the museums seek to challenge conventions of pop art and show that it can be different from the well-known works of Warhol or Lichtenstein. “I hope that visitors will be able to see beyond Corita Kent’s exceptional biography,” Dackerman says. “I want them...to look at the prints themselves and see...how thinking of [the prints] as a part of the movement actually expands the definition of pop art.”

Supplementing “Corita Kent and the Language of Pop” are other exhibitions, both within and outside the museums. For example, StoryCorps came to the Science Center Plaza from Sep. 4-6 to interview Bostonians affected by Kent, while the Schlesinger Library is currently showcasing Kent’s papers in “Corita Kent: Footnotes and Headlines.” Payne, who curated the exhibit at the Schlesinger, says that it adds to Kent’s story by describing her artistic process, the historical context behind her art and her activism with war and hunger.
Events like a Poetry Pop Walk with poet Eileen Myles hope to interest the community further with Kent’s art. The museums’ Department of Academic and Public Programs further seeks to engage students with the exhibit through varied programming including a student opening in October. “What makes this show so special is that it’s not just objects on the wall but [that it’s] really engaging with this fascinating woman,” says Jessica T. Reese ’16, who interned at the museums for the summer.
For many, this deep consideration for Kent’s artistic process is what stands out about the exhibit. Mickey Myers, a student and close friend of Kent, expresses satisfaction with the exhibit’s focus on Kent in terms of her historical and artistic impact. “It puts Corita in the place that she was meant to be,” she says. “It puts her right next to, elbow-to-elbow, frame-to-frame with the giants of the pop era of art.”

Chang Chen, a Taiwanese actor who rose to fame across in Asia in the ’90s, has an impressive resume. At the age of 14, he got his first leading role in Edward Yang’s “A Brighter Summer Day,” which won the Special Jury Prize at the Tokyo International Film Festival. Since then, he has starred in some of the most critically acclaimed Chinese-language films, including “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” “Happy Together,” and “Three Times.” This May, “The Assassin,” Chang’s Latest work and second collaboration with Taiwanese Director Hou Hsiao-Hsien appeared at Cannes Film Festival. It won Hou the award for Best Director. This interview is translated from Chinese.
The Harvard Crimson: You have worked with many iconic Asian directors, from Hou Hsiao-Hsien, and Wang Kar-wai to Tian Zhuangzhuang. What was it like to act in their films, and have they changed at all over time?
Chang Chen: I feel I am very lucky, because my very first film was a Edward Yang film. At that time I did not know much about films; all I had was a good start. After making two films with him, I felt that acting was an interesting job and seriously decided to be an actor. I think Asian directors are comparatively more auteur-ish [than directors from other regions]. Every director would have some of his or her personality shown in films. Wong Kar-wai, for instance, is a very romantic director, and he asks for a lot of tacit understanding from actors. It usually takes him a long time to make a film because he works in a unique way. He talks to the actors, films the actors, and writes the script at the same time. So as he films, he constructs the structure of the film. Ten years ago I worked with Hou Hsiao-Hsien on “Three Time,” and now “The Assassin.” Ten years ago I thought he was a man of strong opinions. His films often dealt with social issues, and while often slow, they are full of emotional tensions. When he made “The Assassin,” since it is essentially a love story, he returned to the simplest emotions. I think this is because he has changed more or less with the increase of age.
THC: What did you think of your role as Tian Ji’an in “The Assassin” and how did you prepare for it?
CC: Hou Hsiao-Hsian asked me and Shu Qi to film “The Assassin” right after “Three Times,” and he [wanted] to do it [then]. I was actually not very used to [acting] when I played in “Three Times” because I joined the crew late when they were already halfway through, and I did not have much time [to acclimate]. [Hou] worked in a unique way. I remember vividly that he never said “action.” He would put the actors in the set and tell you what you are going to do next, and then you acted. When you were acting, maybe his camera would start rolling. It felt like making a documentary to me. So at that time, I was confused about how exactly I should act because many directors would tell you to interact with the camera. Mr. Hou was like the opposite. He asked you to forget about the camera. But at that time I was not so experienced, so it was hard really to grasp this conceptually. When there was a lot of time pressure, I was not satisfied by my work , but in “The Assassin” I had enough time to try whatever I wanted. I think Mr. Hou makes a scene a very realistic environment; what actors need to do is to realize the mood that is supposed to be in that environment. All in all, I worked on “The Assassin” mainly for the fun of it. For an actor, it was a very interesting challenge.
THC: Based on your own experience, what do you think is the most important quality for an actor to have?
CC: I met Mr. Zhong Acheng [a Chinese author and screenwriter] a while ago. Mr. Zhong said that the hardest thing to present in film is smell. If an actor’s performance gives the illusion of smell, then that’s a good actor. I think this is a very interesting idea, but how to convey smell—it is actually really hard. You can see there are still quite a few actors who give people the impression of smell. I think this is both because of their thorough understanding of their own personality and their great insight into their characters. In the end, all these things magically go through the film and present smell to audiences.
THC: Your father was an actor, and you yourself have been acting since childhood. After a lifetime of acting, what does film mean to you and what motivates you to act?
CC: I think it is much easier to be an audience member than to be an actor. I still do this job mostly because, when I made films as a teenager, that working environment really attracted me ... film as a job is very special; it is done together by many people in different professions. The coherence of the whole crew really moved me. It is like the sense of belonging—that people meet, get to know each other, and then work together and grow together. This is why working in films attracted me at first. Then I found out that film is truly interesting, because there are so many subfields, and each requires very specific skills and knowledge. I think a field like this is very vigorous and full of changes.

“Reporting was imitation life, imitation expertise, imitation worldliness, imitation intimacy; mastering a subject only to forget it, befriending people only to drop them,” the journalist Leila muses in Jonathan Franzen’s new novel, “Purity.” “And yet, like so many imitative pleasures, it was highly addictive.” The same description may apply to “Purity” itself, an apparent self-parody of the bildungsroman. The central character, Purity, is nicknamed “Pip” after the protagonist in Charles Dickens’s classic “Great Expectations.” And the novel even becomes like Miss Havisham’s cobwebby house, as Franzen writes and writes, letting dust collect over and bury a collection of characters’ lives to the point of feeling obscuring. The novel’s length, too, suggests that its author found the writing of it “highly addictive.” The story takes a very long time to move forward and is bogged down by rambling subsections. As Pip begins to tie the pieces of her life together it does pick up some speed, but this does not nearly compensate. Although Franzen succeeds in rendering several exquisite passages and characters on a micro scale, “Purity” ultimately struggles to pack a punch on a macro scale, thanks in part to its lagging beginning.
"Purity" initially has trouble sticking in part because of its knotty plotlines, which span too much time and geography. Many characters introduce themselves and then drop off the map without warning. There is Pip, a young woman with massive student loan debts on a quest to find her father. And there’s her mother, a deeply troubled recluse with, of course, a history of family dysfunction. Then there’s also Andreas Wolf, originally from East Germany, who navigated his country’s sociopolitical systems to become a modern media maven with dirty secrets that could be his downfall. And still there’s Tom Aberrant, an editor with the Denver Independent, and his Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Leila, who is working on a story that has nothing to do with the central threads of the novel. And that’s not even mentioning the many other characters whom Franzen semi-fleshes out and then leaves behind. All of these people have backstories and baggage, some of which “Purity” treats at great length, but, for the most part, the information overload makes the novel simultaneously hyper-focused and unwieldy.
Take, for example, Pip’s paragraph-long reflection about her mother’s aging body, a close reading Franzen draws out very early in the story. For an adult, Pip spends too much time with a strange mother and feels unable to extricate herself from the situation. Feeling trapped, she instead fixates on minute details. “The skin on the back of [her mother’s hands] wasn’t pink and opaque like her own skin. It was as if the bones and veins were working their way to the surface; as if the skin were water receding to expose shapes at the bottom of a harbor. Although her hair was thick and very long, there were dry-looking strands of gray in it, and the skin at the base of her throat was like a peach a day past ripe. That night, Pip lay awake in bed and worried that her mother might die soon.” It’s a beautifully successful description, true. The bumps and depressions of her hands feel real and textured, revealing the age of their owner, and such imagery connects well with Pip’s supposed anxiety about her mother’s death. Franzen shows how Pip realizes that her relationship with her mother feels different from those her contemporaries have with their parents. “Some of [Pip’s] friends in Oakland also had problematic parents, but they still managed to speak to them daily without undue weirdness transpiring, because even the most problematic of them had resources that consisted of more than just their single offspring,” Franzen writes. “Pip was it, as far as her own mother was concerned.” He is insightful, but stitch together nearly 600 pages of these slow explanations and “Purity” grows far too long and preachy.
To Franzen’s credit, once “Purity” reaches the 200-page mark and all characters important to Pip’s development have entered the story, the novel begins to examine seriously the questions it should have from the outset. Who is Pip? What kind of mother names her child “Purity” anyway? And why should all of these seemingly random people matter to her? The most engaging part of “Purity” lies with the way these flawed people weave in and out of one another’s lives. But it’s hard to ask those questions without having the necessary information—about the characters, about their entangled lives—on the table. “Purity” risks failing to maintain interest in its narrative on account of its plotlines, which do not connect in an organized way, and despite several intriguing character studies, the relations between people in “Purity,” in the end, still feel murky. As if he realizes that such close scrutiny of his damaged main actors deviates from an ultimate point, Franzen wraps up the novel quickly.
“Purity” flits among genres, at the same time satire, comitragedy, and a girl-finding-her-father narrative, yet feels frustrating as it never seems to have a clear identity. What remains clear, though, is that the novel’s sprawling elements render it complicated, unresolved.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An adolescent crossing the street in stilettos is one of the first images Susana Medina presents in her novel “Philosophical Toys.” The vision follows a deliberation, in the narrator’s head, on the impact of trinkets in her life. Such a sequence may seem anomalous with no apparent logic to it. As the story progresses, however, the significance of these stilettos grow more apparent. For Medina, shoes—and objects in general—function as more than useful items: They reflect a complicated aspect of humanity’s psyche. This examination into the power of objects creates a story both provocative and contemplative, whose only flaw is that it risks being too introspective.
“Philosophical Toys” brilliantly capitalizes on a simple premise: Nina, an art student in London, returns to her Spanish childhood home to find 95 boxes of shoes belonging to her deceased mother. Nina’s father has kept the shoes and done strange things with them. Her unearthing of this family secret sends her on an unusual journey of discovery. Under Medina’s direction, the story veers from its potential nature as a family drama into a universal exploration of the world’s interest in objects. In that respect, Medina distinguishes her novel for its urbanity and sagacity. While Nina continually obsesses over her mother’s past and her [father’s status as a shoe fetishist, her attempts to understand her bizarre inheritance lead her away from her family; instead, she probes into more academic areas, like psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud’s theory of fetishism and the object’s recurrent fetishization in Luis Buñuel’s films. The plot, with its sudden twists and unexpected developments—including a ghost writing stint and a fanatical Buñuel museum—might be the novel’s blood, but Medina ensures that the philosophical discourse is the soul, the factor that gives the book its very edge.
This results in a text devoted to narrator Nina’s ruminations—an excellent choice for a story that thrives on thought and inquiry. “What was a pervert? What was a fetishist? Was it a question of degree?” she inquires when she first considers her father’s fixation on shoes. Such unanswered questions constitute a large portion of Nina’s narrative, along with extensive diatribes on the nature of objects that are enlightening to read. These moments of scrutiny establish an abstract reading experience. In fact, the storytelling reads less like a novel than like an excursion into the protagonist’s mind. Lacking quotation marks or paragraph breaks, dialogue easily blends into description. Sentences combine disjointedly through commas and other unconventional punctuation: “As usual, he dealt with the cooking, he is a good cook, Chris,” Nina says of her boyfriend. While the experimental style might cause confusion in the hands of a less capable author, Medina masterfully infuses her writing with a natural cadence so that the narration can read as easily as the reader’s own disjointed, rambling thoughts.
“Philosophical Toys” truly revolves around Nina, and while this structural choice heavily contributes to the novel’s contemplative tone, it is also detrimental. Nearly all other characters act as one-dimensional chess pieces in Nina’s steady march towards becoming a female philosopher. Nina’s mother—the mysterious Nina Chiavelli who owned 95 pairs of shoes—is portrayed as a wannabe actress, forced to become a foot extra (a stand-in for another actress’s feet). To the novel’s credit, Medina attempts to characterize Nina Chiavelli further; now and then, she includes hints suggesting an alcoholic who sometimes regretted motherhood and often shamed her loving spouse. These efforts, however, do little to liven up a person dead for decades before the start of the novel. The only character besides Nina with any semblance of life is Nina’s friend Mary Jane. From the moment the novel establishes Mary Jane’s infatuation with saying “weeeeiiiiiiiird” and “transforming the perfectly normal into the weird,” it suggests someone who rivals Nina in her vivacity and unique characterization. Mary Jane, perhaps, is the only other character with agency—the one who surprises the most in her actions, from her obsession with baby toys to her desire to pull off a disappearing act. But even then, she becomes a philosophical tool: Her artistic interest in youthful trinkets and stuffed animals only serve to corroborate Nina’s exploration of objects. For all her unique characterization, Mary Jane, too, is a victim to the book’s themes.
Herein lies the novel’s greatest fault: its fascination with philosophy. There is little doubt that Medina knows how to imbue her pages with high concepts. She is aware of the impossibility of fully understanding humanity’s manias and passions. “To posit the world as a question mark implies the adventure of answers. I didn’t seem to find plausible answers to things, I only seemed to find questions,” muses Nina. But in the pursuit of philosophy, Medina sacrifices other critical aspects of a novel. Character development, save for Nina’s, becomes stale. The novel forces the reader to accept certain facts, rather than allowing them to experience them. “Mary Jane was becoming desperate, bitter, dejected, insecure, slowly, progressively, increasingly,” says Nina, not realizing that her friend’s increasingly worrying antics carry more weight than her statement. And even the philosophy grows tiring. With statements like “Objects bind us and objects separate us” and “Words age and lose in luminosity” occupying every paragraph, the ebb of critical thought becomes unrelentless, leaving little room for self-reflection.
This is not to discount the novel’s philosophical merit or the careful manner in which Medina develops her themes. “Then a fragile adolescent running on stilettos crossed the street majestically,” Nina notes near the end of the story, her words a carbon copy of those expressed in the novel’s first page. In its initial appearance, the comment feels jarring and abrupt, but on its return, it carries a deliberate gravitas. The shifting impact reflects a subtle growth within Nina’s narrative and, perhaps, the reader’s perception of it too. It is a sophisticated illustration of the way in which the novel’s plot, characters, and extended musings converge to create an intellectual piece of literature. For all of its flaws, “Philosophical Toys” ultimately presents an engaging, modern take on the human obsession with the tangible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his latest collection of poetry, “Reconnaissance,” Carl Phillips bravely reckons with the ways power is experienced and enacted in intimate relationships. How, he seems to ask, can power be exercised in a moral fashion? Some of the poems question the idea that such a paradox can be solved at all. The illustrative poem “Steeple” opens with such uncertainty: “Maybe love really does mean the submission of power— / I don’t know.” Others explore the intricate and myriad ways power relations play out in close relationships. Elaborating on these relations with a carefully balanced tone, the collection overall is evocative, nuanced, and strikingly beautiful.
Phillips, obviously comfortable with ambiguity and shades of meaning, is also an exacting and careful writer. His poems often feature subtle distinctions in verbal meaning. It is unsurprising that, having graduated from Harvard in 1981 with an A.B. in Greek and Latin, he writes in a style that evokes classical poetry. In his use of carefully unspooling clauses, epithets, and allusions to classical mythology, he resembles other current poets, such as Louise Glück and Anne Carson, who find contemporary resonances in classical forms and references. Additionally, while he addresses issues of recent popular fascination, his work draws strength and wisdom from his deep awareness of history.
Phillips is distinctly attuned to the power people have over each other. As he puts it in “Steeple,” there are so many “ways we do harm, /or refrain from it, when nothing says we have to.” This line characteristically focuses on the intersection of desire with love and mercy: the pull between doing harm and refraining, the “we,” and the multiplicity suggested by “ways” all contribute to a feeling of morally ambivalent intimacy. On the other hand, true love might ultimately be a respite from power, a release from restraint. “Chromatic Black” ends with a wish to be cradled without “shame”: “Here’s a lullaby: /‘No more bondage, no triumph either no more the bluing waves /of shame…’” Similarly, in “From A Land Called Near-Is-Far,” Phillips writes: “For once, let’s /be still. Together. It could be hunger, it could be sex, /that smell, or fearfulness, or just fear by itself—tenderer /hands than ours, soundlessly, as they at last unyoke us.” Sex is seen as a unifying, equalizing, non-hierarchical force here, and at the end of “Last Night,” it is presented even more subtly and delicately: “There’s /a trembling inside the both of us, /there’s a trembling, inside us both.”
Elsewhere in the collection, Phillips explores the pleasures of power with a greater degree of intensity. For instance, in his poem “The Darker Powers,” he writes—“sometimes—out of pity, /not mercy, for /nothing tender /about it—I show the darker /powers I’ve hardly shown /to anyone.” These powers are near and dear to the speaker—Phillips ends the poem with the speaker “putting them back, /just behind my heart, where they blacken /and thrive.” This poem, a seductive dramatic monologue from the perspective of a dominant speaker, shows Phillips at the height of his poetic powers—fully in control, in every sense. Each line is carefully measured, each clause painstakingly weighted. Phillips’s masterful construction gives this poem an intense sonic beauty and power.
Phillips’s appreciation of the pleasure of power is tempered by his awareness of its danger. While some of his poems seem to take a more extreme stance, others add complexity and nuance to his vision. For instance, in “After Learning That The Spell Is Irreversible” the speaker muses, “Did you know there /are animals that will spend their entire /lives in silence, if they don’t get killed /by something more violent, more alive/ somehow?” He refers to these animals’ final noises in terms that suggest artistic expression: “whatever scrap of sound they’d always / held inside them… a kind of / song to at least go down singing.” This poem insists that violent power hierarchies are necessary for the creation of art. But in the very next one Phillips revises that hard stance. He opens “From A Land Called Near-Is-Far” with the question: “But what if all suffering is in fact for nothing— /no particular wisdom after, blooming flower-like, /blood in the water?” which suggests a stepping away from any celebration or justification of the violence power gives rise to.
All the poems indeed abound with war imagery—even the title of the collection refers to a military activity. Phillips returns several times to the battlefield, that ultimate site in which power plays itself out with no room for compromises, just winners and losers. He seems to end with the refusal of intimacy—the final line of the final poem concludes: “Don’t touch me—.” And yet, by ending the poem, and the collection, with this line that breaks off without clear conclusion, Phillips still leaves open the possibility of negotiating power and intimacy in a way that is moral.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When you enter your Expos classroom this fall or spring, you will be participating in one of Harvard's oldest traditions; a one-term course in expository writing has been the one academic experience required of every Harvard student since the writing program was founded in 1872.”—Harvard College Writing Program Website
Bullsh*t. Well, at least for the few dozen first years who applied and were accepted to Humanities 10a and 10b this academic year.
Though this information cannot be found on the Harvard College Writing Program Website, this year, for the first time, Harvard College’s “cornerstone course offering” can be replaced by another course: a full year of Humanities 10.
This article would be easier to write, my outrage more obviously rational, if Hum 10 were going to be conducted just as it was last year, with little regard for the Expos curriculum. But, in an email to The Crimson, the course’s Head TF, Lauren Kopjitic, said the Hum 10 staff has been “working closely with the staff of the Writing Program to create an Expos curriculum that is fully integrated with the Humanities 10 course goals and objectives.” Kopjitic also detailed that there will be an additional thirty minutes of weekly seminar to make time for more writing instruction; students will have to write research papers; and there will be a revision process for each paper.
Nevertheless, I am not satisfied. It’s not that the 75 students in Hum 10 won’t learn to write. They will. It’s that Harvard likes to tout its academic principles and traditions, without openly acknowledging the departures it makes from them; it chooses to make exceptions (maybe reasonable, even desirable ones), but does so discreetly.
My reaction to the change in Expos policy would have been different if the modification had been widely publicized: Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Harvard College remains innovative, changing its age-old writing requirement!
But that’s not how this change was rolled out. And the Hum 10 exception is not the only case of Harvard publicizing one program or principle while quietly enacting policy that contradicts it.
The Harvard University Faculty of Arts and Sciences Handbook clearly states that the “faculty believes that full participation in a classroom setting is essential. Therefore, a student may not enroll in courses that meet at the same time or overlapping times.” It seems the faculty forgot to detail how they don’t believe that full participation in the classroom setting is quite as essential when it comes to introductory computer science.
A student does not need a single additional signature on their study card in order to simultaneously enroll in Computer Science 50 and another course.
And there is little explanation in Harvard's recorded history as to why this is.
The Adams House Dean, Adam Muri-Rosenthal, provided the best explanation a Crimson article published about the CS50 exception could cite. He noted in an email to Adams House that the introductory computer science course’s “innovative pedagogies” do not limit it to a particular time slot.
Again, CS50’s immunity from the simultaneous enrollment policy is not the issue. Harvard not owning its exceptions, not publicizing or articulating their reasons for them, is.
To be a reputable educational institution, Harvard needs to have academic principles at its core. Harvard knows this and seeks to maintain its identity through certain distinctive programs. It flaunts General Education, a program unique to Harvard, in its admissions materials as a program that “aims to make ... students more informed citizens.” It recommits itself to its policy regarding time spent in the classroom because simultaneous enrollment is, in the words of Dean of Undergraduate Education, Jay Harris, "not what a residential college should be offering and [it] is not what a Harvard education should be." It does not create great fanfare when its singular unifying, unique course, Expos 20, becomes one of two options.
Even if Harvard is officially committed to its philosophies, however, the exceptions prove that there is internal debate. And that is good debate. But Harvard needs to make this debate public, and, more importantly, declare: are the principles misguided, or are the exceptions? Or are the principles true in most cases, but in need of the few exceptions, which simply have not been properly acknowledged and explained?
If courses other than Expos can teach writing effectively, why not create more of them so that more than a few dozen students can experience the new teaching format? If CS50’s innovative pedagogies allow for it to be an effective course, whether a student is physically present or not, why not introduce that pedagogy to other classes?
Harvard’s identity will not be marred because Hum 10 can count for Expos credit, but that identity can be shaped if we talk about why the class counts and what will count in the future. Its identity can evolve if we acknowledge the exceptions currently made and consider the merit of its rules. Harvard can grow if we don’t dwell on what makes it unique or what is oldest, but what will make it better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year at Harvard, I have seen too many fall into the Harvard trap. They have formally declared their hatred of math and science, and are trying their best to finish four years of school with as few p-sets as possible. And those who would rather complete p-sets than write essays boast about how few words they have had to write while at Harvard. It is time for Harvard to stop allowing students to graduate without taking a single legitimate science or humanities class. It’s time for a core curriculum.
Students and faculty alike continuously lament the General Education program. Last year, a report released on the program written by seven Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors only confirmed these negative feelings, declaring that the program is “failing” in many areas. These include class sizes that are too large, and the failure of Gen Eds to fulfill their purpose of “identify[ing] the fundamental value of an education.” According to the report, Gen Eds are meant to accomplish four goals: to foster civic engagement, to help students respond to change, to allow students to understand ethics, and to teach students to understand themselves through social traditions. Instead, under the current structure, Gen Eds are a fusion of a distribution requirement, which entails students taking classes in different departments, and a Gen Ed requirement—and fail at achieving either’s goal.
The problem is that we’ve already tried fixing the Gen Ed program—and it hasn’t worked. In 1978, after years of a faltering Gen Ed curriculum, the faculty voted to abolish the Gen Ed program and institute a core program in its place. The core though, which was abolished in 2008, was in many ways similar to the Gen Ed program with which we are currently familiar. Former core requirements like “Foreign Cultures” sound all too familiar to the Gen Ed “Societies of the World” requirement; “Ethical Reasoning” sounds like someone simply hit synonyms when reworking the former “Moral Reasoning” core requirement. Furthermore, students were required to complete only seven of the eleven areas of the former core.
Interestingly, the vision for the original Gen Ed program sounds similar to other schools’ current core curricula with specific required courses. The establishment of the Gen Ed program in 1946 was based on a book, General Education in a Free Society, that proposed that Harvard mandate that students take an intro humanities class entitled “Great Texts in Literature,” an intro social science class called “Western Thought and Institutions,” and one of two science courses. These interdisciplinary courses would fulfill the Gen Ed model by allowing students to learn about the Western world and classics.
Harvard needs a core curriculum, one similar to the vision of the Gen Ed program that was first put forth decades ago. The core should be similar in nature to Columbia College’s core curriculum, which has required classes all students take that equip them with essential multi-disciplinary knowledge. The core curriculum could fix many of the problems associated with the Gen Ed program that future modifications to the program might not successfully rectify.
One of the biggest problems with the Gen Ed program is that students often approach Gen Ed classes as “just a Gen Ed.” Many students take their Gen Ed classes less seriously, and search for Gen Eds that are as painless as possible. Students are not alone in approaching their Gen Eds in a more casual manner. Some professors who teach Gen Ed classes seem to take these classes less seriously, too. They promise that the workload will be light and appropriate for a Gen Ed. These professors often make statements downplaying the importance or seriousness of the Gen Ed courses they teach.
A core curriculum with required coursers could mitigate—if not eliminate—the feeling of “it’s just a Gen Ed.” Students would approach college-wide required core curriculum classes more seriously than Gen Eds, even on topics about which they were not particularly interested, because the classes would be a more formal part of the Harvard education. Though it would take a few years to fully integrate a core into Harvard, once established, it would become a central part of the Harvard experience and identity.
Another benefit of a core curriculum is that it fosters a sense of community. Current students could bond over shared learning and reading, and the required courses would become common memories shared by all alumni.
A core curriculum would also provide students with the opportunity to interact with other undergraduates with varied interests. It is not entirely clear that the Gen Ed system is successful in accomplishing this goal. For example, one may assume that there are few science concentrators enrolled in “Science and Cooking,” a class that many humanities concentrators take to fulfill their Science of the Physical Universe Gen Ed requirement. Core classes would truly bring together a diverse group of students.
While many more factors need to be considered before switching from the Gen Ed system to a core curriculum, the above criticisms are some of the salient concerns in the dialogue—and all weigh heavily in favor of changing the current system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in many years, change is coming to Harvard Yard’s historic Widener Library. According to Sarah E. Thomas, vice president of the Harvard Library system, Widener will close at midnight rather than 10 p.m. on weekday evenings for this academic year.
The announcement served as yet another reminder of the growing campus presence of Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science, the popular undergraduate course. The policy change, Thomas said, came in direct response to a request from David J. Malan ’99, the professor and public persona behind the course. A record-breaking 818 undergraduates enrolled in the class last fall. This semester, Widener’s Loker Reading Room will host the teaching staff’s office hours until closing on Mondays and Tuesdays.
On its own, the policy change is commendable. The new hours will line up Widener’s hours more closely with many undergraduates’ study schedules, making the library a more attractive alternative to Lamont for all students, regardless of whether they are enrolled in CS50.
But the path to the policy change is troubling. The University already has a system for courses to reserve rooms and study spaces. To allow a single course to work around the rules, regardless of its popularity, sets an undesirable precedent, signaling that Harvard deems some courses and departments more important than others.
Professor Malan offered a less-than-convincing explanation for why the course needs special access to Loker, as opposed to the larger Annenberg Hall, which it has used for office hours in the past. “[Loker is] a beautiful space,” he wrote in a July email to a Crimson reporter, "it's well lit, and it's well equipped with plenty of seats and power outlets for students.”
This change is particularly noteworthy because of the history of special treatment afforded to CS50. The Administrative Board, for example, has allowed the course to circumvent simultaneous enrollment rules, and CS50’s so-called regret clause allows students to avoid more serious punishment for violations of academic integrity.
Over the past week, posters and social media posts have parodied the yearly hype surrounding the course, using the hashtag #notcs50. This phenomenon responds to a tension that many Harvard students feel between what Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana might call the University’s interest in a “transformational” education, and the rise of courses that appear “transactional” or pre-professional. Over the past few years, Harvard has signaled on several occasions that it fears losing ground to its competitors in computer science and engineering, a problem that is inextricably tied to the fundraising arms race in higher education today.
The question of access to Widener Library, the landmark that may best represent Harvard’s historic identity, seems to represent a much larger debate. How much of the traditional Harvard must pass away for the university to remain a leading light in the twenty-first century? The fundamental question is not just about fustiness versus openness, as CS50 would have us believe; it’s about transformation versus transaction, too. Students should be glad that Widener is more open to them than ever before. But they shouldn’t celebrate that Harvard has slid another inch from its historic identity as a champion of all the liberal arts, not just the profitable ones.

Following a months-long search to replace Ellen M. Cosgrove as Harvard Law School's dean of students, Marcia Sells, an administrator at Columbia, will assume the post on Sept. 21.
Starting in the spring, the search for a new dean of students incorporated student input, and students said in the spring that they hoped the Law School would appoint a dean with professional experience with issues of diversity and inclusion. Students from affinity groups and student government played a role in formulating a job description for the position, and they helped interview finalists, according to students involved in the process and Jeffrey C. McNaught, the acting dean of students.
Faye E. Maison, a student leader of Students for Inclusion—a student group at the Law School that focuses on the common concerns of different affinity groups—said questions focused on issues of mental health and diversity. Maison said she did not interview Sells, who is a black woman. Sells did not respond to requests for comment Monday.
“A lot of the questions were pretty student centered and focused or based on what had happened in the last school year. There was a lot of concern about how you would handle issues of mental health and how you would approach issues of diversity,” Maison said.
Diversity and inclusion rose to the forefront of campus discourse last year after several groups of students said the Law School’s administration support for minority students after several prominent cases of police violence against unarmed black men nationwide was inadequate.
Maison said Sells’s extensive experience in student administrative and human resources positions makes her a very qualified person for the job.
“It seems like people are pretty excited about her,” Maison said.
The Law School also consulted with Diversified Search, an employment consulting firm. The Law School's dean of students, much like the dean of the College, oversees extracurricular and out-of-the-classroom aspects of the Law School experience.
The dean of students has also historically served as a Title IX coordinator. McNaught said he will continue to serve as a Title IX coordinator, adding that Sells may eventually take over. The Law School is rolling out a new Title IX process this fall.
Sells comes to the Law School after a long career in higher education administration. She currently serves as the associate dean for outreach and education in the School of the Arts and associate vice president for program development for program development and initiatives. She has previously served in human resources and development roles at organizations including Reuters American and the National Basketball Association.
Students from affinity groups said they are optimistic about the administrative change. Leland S. Shelton, the president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, said he hopes Sells will help change the environment at the Law School.
“In an ideal world a new dean of students would look to address issue of intersectionality and microaggression both at the Law School and at the classroom and helping minority students acclimate to the Law School environment and helping them feel comfortable,” Shelton said.

She didn’t until Monday, but poet Jenny Zhang now has her own Wikipedia page. That’s thanks to a handful of Harvard undergraduates, who gathered in a Sever Hall classroom with laptops on Labor Day and took to the online encyclopedia in what they termed an “edit-a-thon.”
With the stated purpose of changing and adding Wikipedia pages related to feminist, BGLTQ, and human rights issues, the group of about eight students went on an editing spree, taking out phrasing they saw as offensive and otherwise tweaking the site.
In a mass email advertising the event, student-run feminist publication Manifesta Magazine described the event as part of a movement to “dismantle the patriarchy” on Wikipedia.
For example, Erica X. Eisen ’16, a former Crimson arts chair, beefed up the text on the Wikipedia page on American feminism, deeming it “too short” and what the site considers a “stub,” or an article too short to provide proper encyclopedic coverage of a particular topic.
The group on Monday focused on editing pages highlighted by several collaborative pages, called “WikiProjects,” where users gather to propose and make changes to articles related to a certain topic.
For example, a WikiProject page on feminism calls for people to “find, expand, create and identify all the substantive topics in feminism and women's rights and to expand the presence of these topics on Wikipedia.” Among other things, the page suggests that users delete a comic strip stereotyping lesbian women.
Users with an account can join a WikiProject, even if they lack expert knowledge of the particular topic. Users can choose to delete a page or copy edit it, checking its content for accuracy and basic facts. Monday’s event at Harvard focused primarily on WikiProjects relating to women and indigenous Americans and pages about disability and discrimination.
According to Talia Weisberg ’17 and Terilyn S. Chen ’16, both writers for Manifesta Magazine, they are not alone in organizing Wikipedia editing sessions. Other colleges and organizations on Harvard’s campus have hosted such events, they said.
Wikipedia, which itself hosts a page on edit-a-thons, highlights a 2013 meetup devoted to editing the site at Harvard’s Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.

The College Events Board’s annual welcome back event, Camp Harvard, featured marshmallows toasting over a fire pit, resident deans plunging into a dunk tank, and a mechanical bull at Tercentenary Theatre.
Students camped out with hamburgers in hand on the steps of Widener Library as spectators watched volunteers try their luck riding the mechanical bull.
“It was exhilarating,” Isabel M. Lapuerta ’19 said. “But I was little bit self-conscious because everybody could see me fall on my behind.”
On the opposite end of the Yard, students lined up to dunk a roster of college administrators, housemasters, and resident deans. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who briefly stopped to survey the scene before preparing for his own turn, seemed excited about his first foray in a dunk tank.
A backdrop emblazoned with the College Events Board logo provided a makeshift station for attendees to take photos, while a staff photographer roamed the Yard looking to capture students posing with a Camp Harvard picture frame prop.
Situated between several spike ball games, students from the Resource Efficiency Program set up a round of limbo, in an attempt to teach students how to “lower” their carbon footprint.
Although the event was held in the Yard, it drew upperclassmen in addition to freshmen, a goal of the College Events Board.
“It’s great to see all of the freshmen out here, seeing the whole community together, not only the freshmen, but also the upperclassmen as well. That doesn’t happen as often,” George Baxter ’17 said.
Overlooking the festivities, a group of student volunteers from Crimson EMS stood on-call. According to one, the presence of the mechanical bull warranted increased volunteers compared to previous years.
“We always enjoy serving. We get to experience Camp Harvard and keep people safe if needed,” Annelie E. Herrmann ’18 said.

At the College’s first-ever freshman day of service on Saturday morning, College students and faculty were dispatched to one of 17 locations around the greater Boston area for volunteer projects.
According to Gene A. Corbin, the College's assistant dean of student life for public service, interested students met on campus Saturday morning and listened to opening remarks from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson, and Cambridge City Councillor E. Denise Simmons. Shortly after, they were assigned to a service trip and spent the day engaging in public service alongside service team leaders, including Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
About 400 members of the Class of 2019 participated in the day of service, Corbin said.
The event’s service projects were geared mainly toward preparing Boston’s public schools for their first day of classes on Tuesday, according to a Phillips Brooks Housepress release.
For Sienna R. Nielsen ’19, Saturday’s event meant traveling to Ellison Park in Waltham, Mass. Nielsen also made opening remarks at the College to make students more excited about the event.
The day of service was “a very exciting opportunity to get to know freshmen, and also to embark on a project that would be our first gateway to public service on campus,” Nielsen said, adding that she hopes to take advantage of being at Harvard and near the city of Boston because options for large-scale community involvement were limited in her small hometown.
This event is one of many programs for freshmen that take students out of the Yard—"Through the Gates" trips involve freshmen exploring Boston and attending events such as Red Sox games, kayak outings, and tours of Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts.

UPDATED: September 9, 2015, at 1:51 a.m.
History professor Evelyn B. Higginbotham is among the recipients of the 2014 National Humanities Medal, the White House announced on Friday.
The award recognizes Higginbotham, a professor of History and African and African American Studies, for her contributions to the study of African American history. According to the White House citation, Higginbotham “has traced the course of African-American progress, and deepened our understanding of the American story.”
Higginbotham and the nine other recipients, among whom are historians, a poet, a food activist, and even an education course, will receive medals from President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House on Sept. 10.
The National Humanities Medal recognizes “individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities and broadened our citizens' engagement with history, literature, languages, philosophy, and other humanities subjects,” according to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which manages the selection process for the White House.
In the announcement, Chad Williams, an African and Afro-American Studies professor at Brandeis University, praised Higginbotham for her scholarship and her contributions to the intellectual history of the African American community.
Williams highlighted Higginbotham’s work as editor-in-chief of The Harvard Guide to African-American History, published in 2001, and her co-editorship with fellow Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., of the African American National Biography, a print edition of which was published in 2008. He also recognized Higginbotham’s own academic work, including her 1993 book "Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church: 1880–1920." Williams described Higginbotham’s book as “a work of meticulous research and theoretical innovation.”
Higginbotham is a former chair of the Department of African and African American Studies. She wrote in an email Monday night that she was "thrilled and truly honored" to receive the medal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the rollout of a new electronic study card system on the reworked my.harvard portal, advisers across the College’s academic departments have adjusted their beginning-of-semester procedures for the new online system.
Prior to this summer's redesign of my.harvard, students could print multiple versions of study cards and had to solicit signatures for all from their academic advisers. Now, with the approval process shifted online, advisers simply lift an electronic hold to allow students to officially complete course registration. 
“My general sense is that students are eager to have the advising holds lifted and have been trickling into advising meetings earlier,” said Lauren Bimmler, who is the English Department’s undergraduate program administrator and serves as a full-time adviser for the department. “It’s an improvement on before when students would mostly wait until close to study card day to meet with their advisers.”
According to Bimmler, close to a third of the advising holds for English concentrators were lifted as of Friday afternoon. She added that the advising ratio varies by faculty member but can range anywhere from two to 12 students per adviser.
Jeffrey A. Miron, the director of undergraduate studies in the Economics Department, also said that the lifting of the advising hold was contingent on student conversations with their advisers. He noted that, under the new system, students might change their course list after their advising conversations.
“Once the conversations happen, we lift the hold and the student is free to turn that study card in, and if the student makes a change, the student can do so without coming back to the adviser,” Miron said. “We’d be happy for them to come back and talk to us some more if they want, but they can do it on their own.”
In contrast to the Economics Department’s approach to course changes after the initial advising meeting, the English Department emphasizes that students will inform their advisers of all potential course schedules during the advising meeting.
“We made sure to remind faculty advisers that, if a student is not totally decided on their four or five classes, they make sure they know what the options are,” Bimmler said.
Economics lecturer and adviser Anne N. Le Brun said her meetings have not been concentrated on the day when study cards are due.
“I enjoy the fact that you have conversations over many days with the new system,” Le Brun said. “It’s more spread out, done more calmly, and perhaps more time is spent on each student.”
In that department, five full-time concentration advisers and Miron himself can lift the advising hold. According to Miron, prior to sophomore concentration declarations in November, each adviser is responsible for slightly less than 100 advisees.
Andrew Berry, a lecturer on organismic and evolutionary biology who advises students in the life sciences, said that he has been pleasantly surprised by the way in which the new system has impacted the advising process.
“I was worried that students would just send lists of courses over email but that hasn’t happened yet,” said Berry, who estimates that he had met with close to 100 students regarding study cards by Saturday afternoon. “Now with the hold-release system, students can come into the office without having everything pinned down. The system is less high school-like—it means more responsibility for the student, and it’s less prescriptive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 8, 2015, at 1:35 a.m.
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals, a campus drag troupe famous for burlesque productions and “roasting” celebrities, is discussing whether to add women to its traditionally all-male cast after more than a century.
Women are involved in the Theatricals through its business staff, tech crew, band, and creative writing and music teams, but the cast of its burlesque shows has been composed of all men since 1844. According to Theatricals president Robert T. Fitzpatrick ’16, adding women to the troupe’s cast has been a “topic of serious conversation” since this spring.
Fitzpatrick’s statement about the Pudding’s internal discussions, sent to The Crimson in an email early Tuesday morning, came in response to a decision by a group of undergraduate women to sign up for the group’s upcoming auditions en masse in protest of its all-male cast. As of early Monday evening, 17 women had signed up in advance of next weekend’s auditions for the cast of the group’s upcoming shows.
According to Fitzpatrick, the Pudding will likely continue to discuss whether or not to add women to its cast through after this year’s audition period because changing its gender makeup would require “structural changes to the production, the company, and our larger institutional traditions.”
Still, he acknowledged the protesters’ input, writing that “the Theatricals would like to express appreciation for those outside of our company who have taken interest and vocalized opinions about this topic. They will be taken into consideration as we continue our discussion.”
Tess V. Davison ’16 and Olivia R. Miller ’16, two of the women who signed up to audition for the Pudding cast, said they were prompted to organize the protest when they participated in a summer competition to write the script for the group’s upcoming spring show. They want to challenge the long-established tradition, they said, because they wanted not only to write performances, but also to act in them.
“We were just thinking about how we would like to be a part of the Pudding, but we still had our hesitations because we still feel it’s not quite a fair and equal group,” Davison said.
So far, the protest has already attracted attention on social media. Davison and Miller first sent out an email to several women on campus involved in theater asking them to join them and audition as a way to challenge the norm of the male-only cast. After they signed 14 women up to audition, protest participant Megan G. Jones ’16 posted a photograph of the sign up sheet on Facebook and Instagram, amassing more than 200 likes.
Glenn A. Kiser ’91, a former Pudding actor who now works in film production and with the College’s Freshman Arts Program, weighed in on Facebook, sharing Jones’s post and expressing his support for the protest. In an interview, he said others involved in theater at Harvard were upset by the Pudding’s exclusion of women from its cast when he was a member because it limited opportunities for actresses.
“For the actors that are potentially interested in pursuing an acting career, the Pudding is really the closest thing available as an undergraduate to what a professional career might be like because you work with a professional director, choreographer; a lot of the direction comes from professionals,” Kiser said.
“There are a lot of really interesting traditions at the Pudding,” he added. “But now in 2015, the all-male cast is one of the least interesting traditions.”
More women have signed up since Jones posted the photo on Sunday afternoon with the hashtags “#drag4all” and “#revolution.” Several women who signed up to audition acted in a production—this one with an all-female cast—last spring about women and gender equity.
Some protest participants said they believe that the Pudding’s policy to keep its cast all-male stands in stark contrast with other theater groups on campus.
“I think it's particularly important that where there's gender inequality, a red flag should be raised, but I think it’s especially important in the arts, because the arts present itself as this really open place where anyone with any level of experience can join, and there's a culture of openness,” said Elizabeth P. Terry-Kantor ’18, who plans on auditioning. She said she plans to take the opportunity seriously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—President Barack Obama flew into Boston on a sunny Labor Day to rally unions and announce a new executive order that will require federal contractors to give employees paid sick leave.
In his speech at Greater Boston Labor Council breakfast, he announced the order, which allows federal workers one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours they work, amounting to a maximum seven days per year. The new law will give paid sick days to 300,000 workers, he said.
The President also took jabs at Republicans in front of his 765 supporters gathered at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, suggesting differences between their approaches to helping the middle class.
“You just wait, you look up at the sky and prosperity will come raining down on us from the top of whatever high-rise in New York City,” he said. “But that’s not how the economy works.”
During his remarks, the president spoke extensively about the importance of unions, even making a quip about New England Patriots football quarterback Tom Brady, who was recently acquitted on a four-game suspension.
“Even Brady is happy he’s got a union. They had his back,” Obama said. “So you know if Brady needs a union, we definitely need unions. Because the fact of the matter is, even kids understand this: You’re stronger when you stand together.”
Earlier in the morning, the president arrived at Boston’s Logan Airport on a small Air Force One jet. Preceded by military personnel, he jogged down the portable aircraft steps in a casual blue collared shirt and khaki slacks, waving to a crowd of admirers and reporters. Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh and Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker '79 greeted the president and chatted with him for a few minutes. Several Harvard students helped check in members of the press and other visitors, who were personally greeted by the president on the tarmac.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A study funded by the petroleum industry has claimed that Harvard would lose $108 million in investment returns per year if it divested its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels.
The divestment debate at the University was fiery last academic year, as student environmental activists and administrators clashed on the issue time and again. In April, members and supporters of activist group Divest Harvard staged a weeklong blockade of Massachusetts Hall, shutting out University President Drew G. Faust and other top administrators from their offices.
Faust has repeatedly argued against divestment and that doing so would unduly politicize the endowment and adding that Harvard can best combat climate change by investing in research and education.
The study, conducted by Bradford Cornell, a visiting professor at California Institute of Technology, examined the cost of divestment for five universities—all of which have continued to invest in fossil fuel stock in spite of protest from students, alumni, and faculty members—by using mutual funds to create proxies for the school’s holdings, which are not disclosed. It claimed that all of them would lose money if they divested.
A growing number of colleges, many of them institutions with smaller endowments, have decided to divest their endowments out of a concern for climate change.
Divest Harvard co-coordinator Talia K. Rothstein ’17 said the she was less concerned about Harvard’s losses and more concerned she was about what she sees immoral investing in the fossil fuel industry. She also was skeptical about the source of funding for the survey, which was commissioned by Independent Petroleum Association of America, a natural gas and crude oil lobby.
“The fluidity that we’re seeing with which industry money and research about climate change is interacting is really deeply disturbing to me,” she said.
Harvard spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment.
Petroleum companies have a history of funding climate research. The California Institute of Technology report references other research released earlier this year, funded by the same petroleum lobby, that found average divested portfolios would produce returns on average .7 percent lower than portfolios that do invest in fossil fuels. Still, other observers have predicted volatility in the fossil fuel industry and urged investors to look elsewhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first weekend of action, the Harvard women’s rugby team dropped a match against a University of Prince Edward Island team it had never faced and defeated Division II heavyweight Bowdoin at the Bowdoin Round Robin.
Despite having a young squad, the team’s relative lack of experience did not show, with two of the team’s four tries for the weekend coming from freshman.
Last spring, the team had its first experience playing 7’s rugby—a change most saw as beneficial because of the faster pace and a tighter level of execution required for success. Overall, both players and Harvard coach Sue Parker saw the weekend as a great opportunity to showcase some of what they learned from 7’s.
“It’s clear that all of our freshmen are going to be huge contributors to this team,” Parker said. “I think it all works together. The opportunity we had to play 7’s was critical for each player and the team because everyone is really filling into rugby.”
UNIVERSITY OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND 19, HARVARD 7
Despite the loss to the Panthers, a lot came together for the Crimson in its first matchup of the day. Throughout the game, freshmen and veterans alike made more than a few critical tackles, with freshman center Caitlin Wiegel scoring the lone try for Harvard.
Captain Hope Schwartz, a former Crimson Sports editor, credited former two-time high school All-American Weigel’s try as an important starting point for the season.
“She ran a really beautiful line and a line that we’ve been working on and really emphasizing this season,” Schwartz said. “It was really cool to see that work. The try happened not just because of Caitlin’s really good line but because our whole team did exactly what we had been practicing to do.”
UPEI had scored twice before the Crimson had a successful try and conversion. The Panthers, led by Team Canada standout Alysha Corrigan, also converted on two of their three tries to take the game by a 19-7 score.
“Most of those girls on that team have been playing rugby throughout their high school careers,” Parker said. “I thought we played a strong game given the fact that it was our first real competition of the year. I don’t think they really had anything on us athletically but they definitely had more experience rugby wise.”
HARVARD 15, BOWDOIN 0
In the second game of the round robin, the Crimson got going early with all three of its tries coming in the first half. Junior fly-half Taciana Pereira and classmate Claire Collins both scored, while the third try came from freshman wing Sarah Lipson.
“[Lipson] was able to turn the corner on a defender, beat another defender, and score down in the corner,” Schwartz said. “This is the first time she had played in the game after practicing with us for only a week and a half.”
Bowdoin, a school that has traditionally competes at the Division III level for most of its sports, plays up a division in women’s rugby, where the team is part of the Division II New England Small College league. The team has competed for the national championship and went undefeated in conference play last year, underscoring its abilities.
The early offense proved to be enough for Harvard, as the score held through the second half with neither team scoring.
“We played a lot better at the end of the day than we did at the beginning and that’s sort of what were looking for in a preseason exhibition game,” Schwartz said. “I would say that we worked out a lot of the issues that came out in the first game and improved it in the second game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to build upon a finish to last season which saw the team lose only one of its last 14 games, the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-1-1) opened up the season at home without a win, losing to Loyola Marymount (4-0-0) before drawing with No. 23 Southern Methodist (2-1-1).
HARVARD 2, SMU 2
After being held scoreless in its season opener, the Crimson offense came alive as goals by senior forwards Jake Freeman and Oliver White helped Harvard pick up a draw versus the Mustangs.
The Crimson played catch-up from early on, as SMU rookie Caleb Smith broke down the Harvard defense on the wing before taking a shot that rebounded off senior goalkeeper Evan Mendez. The ball landed at the feet of SMU forward Mauro Cichero, who took a touch and slotted it into the net to give the Mustangs the lead a little under five minutes into the contest.
Despite some early jitters, Harvard began to pressure SMU offensively. The Crimson looked like it had evened the score in the 39th minute after the ball bounced into the net following a collision between senior Tim Schmoll and SMU goalie Michael Nelson off Schmoll’s header. But the referee waved it off for a foul. Despite the goal being disallowed, the play appeared to further spark the Harvard attack.
“One of our traits is that we fight and never give up,” White said. “Especially with [Schmoll’s] goal being called back, as well as their goal, it really lit a fire underneath us, and we just wanted to fight.”
The disallowed goal didn’t deter the Crimson offense, as Freeman would score his first goal of the season in the 42nd minute. After sophomore Sam Brown’s initial effort was blocked inside the box, Freeman collected the ball and calmly drove it into the lower right corner for the first Harvard goal of the season.
The offensive pressure continued for the Crimson in the second half, as White joined Freeman on the stat sheet with a goal 65 seconds into the stanza. The Belmont, Mass., native squeezed between two SMU defenders and headed it past Nelson from inside the goal box following a long throw in by classmate Michael Klain.
Though Harvard continued to press forward, it was the Mustangs who scored after sophomore Christian Sady took down SMU’s Anthony Jeffries inside the penalty area, conceding a penalty shot in the 54th minute. The Mustang’s John Lujano converted the opportunity with a chip down the middle, scoring the last goal of the game.
While the Crimson dominated offensively following the spot kick, including a six-to-one shot advantage in double overtime, it was unable to get past Nelson, ultimately leading to a draw.
Though the team was ultimately unable to obtain their first win, Harvard coach Peter Lehrer was happy with his team’s performance.
“I thought [the game] was pretty good,” Lehrer said. “The energy was pretty good, [SMU] is a really good team but these guys fought hard and we kept the ball a lot more and executed a lot better.”
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 1, HARVARD 0
A goal by LMU forward Alvaro Madrigal helped the Lions spoil Harvard’s season opener, 1-0.
In a contest that didn’t feature many clear scoring opportunities for either side, it was Madrigal who made the difference in the 73rd minute. The forward dribbled his way past two Crimson players before unleashing a shot from 25 yards out past Mendez and into the far post.
Madrigal and teammate Adrian Perez proved to be difficult to contain for Harvard, as the two helped break down the Crimson defense, particularly in transition where LMU had the majority of its opportunities.
“Those are two good players,” Lehrer said. “They have good feet, the move well, so they’re a handful to deal with in transition or in the run of play. We just need to slow down, make them come backwards.”
Despite having a 12-to-11 shot advantage, the Crimson was not able to consistently threaten the Lions, placing only four shots on goal compared to eight for LMU. Harvard’s closest opportunity came off the foot of senior Phillip Fleischman, who attempted to poke it in off a cross but was calmly denied by LMU goalie Paul Blanchette.
The Crimson was also unable to dominate the midfield, often failing to keep possession as well as losing many of the 50-50 battles that led to LMU threats and scoring opportunities.
“It was a hard fought game,” said junior co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu. “There were a lot of 50-50 battles that decided the game quite a bit especially in the midfield…. Unfortunately the 50-50s weren’t in our favor today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning a share of the conference championship last year and being one win away from an NCAA Tournament bid, the Harvard women’s volleyball team was reminded just how tough it will be to repeat last season’s performance.
Opening its season off with a straight-set win versus Rutgers (1-5), the Crimson (1-2) dropped its final two games of the weekend at the 2015 Harvard Invitational, failing to win a set against either Illinois State (4-2) or Long Beach State (4-2).
“It’s still the preseason,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “So it’s a great time for us to test our limits and see where they are.”
LONG BEACH STATE 3, HARVARD 0
With Harvard one point away from clinching the first set, the 49ers turned the tide on the match. After a Crimson service error, two kills from junior Nele Barber helped Long Beach State win the first set en route to winning three-straight sets to win its second match of the weekend and hand Harvard its second loss.
“As a team, we can all get better at defense,” co-captain Hannah Schmidt said. “Especially against the slide.”
Barber was too much for the Crimson to handle, recording 19 kills in only three sets. No players on the Crimson recorded even half of that total, with sophomores Paige Kebe and Caroline Labanowski leading the squad at nine apiece. The two second-years played sparingly freshman year, but played consistently throughout the weekend in an effort to replace the minutes of key seniors that had graduated.
The 49ers went on a 5-0 run midway through the third set to give the squad what turned out to be an insurmountable lead and effectively sealed the match.
ILLINOIS STATE 3, HARVARD 0
The Redbirds got off to a hot start in the Malkin Athletic Center on Saturday, jumping out to an 11-3 lead in the first set. Illinois State didn’t look back from there.
Harvard dropped three straight sets to the Redbirds to suffer its first loss of the year.
The Crimson stayed with Illinois State for the majority of the second set, tying the game at 19 points apiece. But the Redbirds would win six of the next nine points to take the second set.
Offense was at a premium for Harvard, as senior Kathleen Wallace was the leading attacker for the Crimson with seven kills.
Two freshmen also made their season debuts over the weekend, as Anna Uhr and Christina Cornelius started for Harvard.
“They really stepped up to the plate,” Holte said. “It’s exciting to prove that we’re a team with depth.”
HARVARD 3, RUTGERS 0
After winning the first set of the first contest of the year, the Crimson found itself in a 22-17 hole in the subsequent frame. After a service error from the Scarlet Knights, junior setter Corie Bain trotted back to take the serve and try to regain some momentum for Harvard.
She served seven straight times. The Crimson scored seven straight points.
Harvard found itself in a similar position in the next set, down five points with Rutgers five points away from a set win. But the Crimson rallied off ten of the next thirteen points to take third set and the game. Wallace led the late-set charge with three of the team’s seven kills during the run.
All of the sets were hotly contested, as Harvard pulled out all of the three frames by three or fewer points.
Notably absent for most of the weekend was junior Grace Weghorst, who only played in limited action against Illinois State. An All-Ivy League Honorable Mention, Weghorst dealt with nagging injuries all of last year on the team’s path towards a share of the Ivy League title.
Though the Crimson was unable to come away with a winning record, the team was took away a few lessons from the weekend.
“We learned that there’s still a lot of room for us to grow,” Holte said. “That’s what we’re going to be working on for these next few days.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Heading into the final minutes, the results of both of the Harvard women’s soccer team’s games this weekend were hanging in the balance.
On Sunday, Connecticut junior forward Rachel Hill beat Crimson junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack with just 36 seconds left to lift the No. 25 Huskies (5-0-0) to a 2-1 victory. In the first game of the weekend on Friday, junior forward Midge Purce hit the crossbar on a shot attempt with less than a second remaining as Harvard (1-2-1) had to settle for a scoreless double-overtime tie with Alabama (1-3-2).
CONNECTICUT 2, HARVARD 1
Hill provided the dramatics in what proved to be the fifth win in a row for No. 25 UConn in Storrs, Conn. Durack put up a strong performance in net as the Huskies’ offense attacked the Harvard zone throughout the entire contest. The junior made five first-half saves in what remained a scoreless game for nearly 70 minutes.
But just before the 70-minute threshold, Purce buried junior forward Joan Fleischman’s cross into the back of the net to give the guests a one-goal edge. The score held for the next 15 minutes as the Crimson defense bent but did not break against a flurry of UConn shots and corner kicks.
UConn finally broke through in the 86th minute as senior forward Samantha McGuire notched her second goal of the season to tie the game at one. Just when it seemed as though the game was headed for overtime, Hill responded with the dagger. It was the New Hampshire native’s fourth tally of the season, helping the Huskies to their best start since 1998.
While midfielders Haley Washburn and Dani Stollar provided offense for Harvard on Friday night with six shots in total, the pair had to stay back on Sunday to try stymying the Huskies’ attack.
“We’re just figuring each other out more,” Washburn said. “Each game that we have, I’m learning more about her, she’s learning more about me. As a team, we’re learning more about each other.”
The freshman trio of Leah Mohammadi, Niki Young, and Hannah Natanson once again contributed key minutes for the Crimson.
“We love all of our freshmen, and I think they’ve been doing a great job,” Washburn said. “It’s always a tough transition coming in freshman year, but they’ve been really awesome.”
HARVARD 0, ALABAMA 0
Right when it looked like the game was over, Purce provided one last chance for Harvard. It was Purce against the clock as the junior dribbled the ball down the sideline and fired away with under a second to go. As the crowd at Soldiers’ Field Stadium held its breath, the ball clanked off the crossbar, and the Crimson Tide sideline exhaled.
“I never hear anyone, but I could hear people [counting down from] 10 seconds,” Purce said. “[Coach] Ray [Leone] was talking about how he saw a team score with 10 seconds left, and I think our team thought through the whole game we were going to get one.”
Aside from slow starts to both halves, the Crimson kept the ball in the Alabama zone for most of the evening. Stollar played a significant role in the offensive attack, and Washburn and Purce had five shots apiece.
Overall, Harvard outshot the Crimson Tide, 18-9, with seven of the Crimson shots coming on net. Friday marked the first time Harvard had squared off with a Southeastern Conference opponent since the Crimson tied Alabama’s Iron Bowl rival, Auburn, in 2003.
In the first 10-minute overtime period, neither team was able to generate any real scoring chances. The physical play intensified in the second session, with the teams exchanging corner kicks and Harvard gaining two free kicks via Crimson Tide fouls. But in the end, there was nothing to separate the two sides.
Nonetheless, throughout the game, each time Alabama began to swing the game’s momentum, the Crimson was able to generate a chance of its own.
“I’m so proud of my team,” Purce said. “They were absolutely incredible…. In our heads, we were like [a goal]’s coming. We played 110 minutes all the way through, even the last 10 seconds.”

When Harvard administrators launched the new website, “perfection” seemed too flawed a word describe the new levels of beauty and functionality it achieved. The design elegantly unfolds beneath one’s mouse, oozing with grace and stunning graphics. As a user, the interface could not be more intuitive, the site seemingly urging you to click exactly where you want to go next. Mark Zuckerberg himself is surely wishing he never dropped out of school, just so he could get a chance to engage with Harvard’s latest technological masterpiece on a daily basis.
We are, of course, talking about the new HUDS website, otherwise known as the greatest thing to happen to the internet since cats on YouTube.
Yet this epitome of virtual sophistication has gone almost entirely unnoticed by the Harvard community, which has been instead preoccupied with the new my.harvard website, which seems to have more bugs than a Mississippi swamp.
While the HUDS website is best described as simply dope, most Harvard students would not be surprised if HUIT--or UHS for that matter--classified the new my.harvard as a virus that was wreaking havoc on the student body like an outbreak of swine flu.
On the one hand, the HUDS website features a dining hall employee lovingly spooning tomato sauce on pizza dough, on the other hand, the my.harvard website even notes on its home page all of the errors it has with signing in. It’s so bad, it doesn’t even try to hide it’s technological horribleness.
Administrators can fully expect enrollment numbers for SPU27: Science and Cooking to skyrocket this semester as Harvard students pass up the excruciating process of browsing courses on my.harvard in favor of spending hours watching the rotating slideshow on the new HUDS site.
Next time you have to use the my.harvard website, instead of acting on that carnal urge to vandalize the Registrar’s office--a feeling with which we are all very familiar by now--we here at Flyby recommend that you redirect your attention to dining.harvard.edu and lose yourself in the perfectly plated asparagus.

While most students probably spent shopping week catching up with friends and hunting for that elusive gem fourth class, some no doubt noticed the roll out of Harvard College’s latest initiative, the honor code. Administrators say it is the result of years of planning, and student members of the Honor Council say it is part of the culture change they hope to drive. However, you, dear student, are still probably scratching your head and asking: what honor code?
Flyby is here to help.
What is the honor code?
The honor code is—at its most basic—a statement about the importance of academic integrity to the Harvard College “community,” and explicitly cites cheating and plagiarism as examples of academic dishonesty that violate standards at both Harvard and in the broader world. After debate, this past April the Faculty approved legislation requiring that students affirm their awareness of the honor code prior to course enrollment and before final exams and projects, including theses, and other assignments at the discretion of individual professors.
What is the Honor Council?
While the honor code is a relatively mundane paragraph that reiterates standard guidelines, the Honor Council is where things start to get interesting. Composed of 24 voting members, half of which are undergraduate students, the Honor Council is tasked with enforcing the honor code and will adjudicate what are essentially cheating cases that violate the code. The council also includes faculty and administrators, and is a rare instance of student participation in the College’s disciplinary process. Brett Flehinger, associate dean of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, will serve as secretary of the Honor Council, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will serve as chair. The council will begin hearing cases this fall.
What is the history of the code?
According to the Honor Council’s website, the honor code traces its history to “the formation of the Committee on Academic Integrity in 2010.” In some ways that is true; since 2010, a group of students, faculty, and administrators has been meeting in some capacity to discuss adopting an honor code, and then business professor and Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana was the main faculty member on the subcommittee that drafted the code. However, that’s not the full story. What gets left out from the website and most administrators’ discourse is the massive Gov 1310 cheating scandal, the College’s largest in recent memory, that required 70 students to temporarily leave campus and gave the process a huge kick in the rear.
What is the big deal?
The introduction of the honor code and Council this fall, with accompanying fanfare and a dedicated Facebook page, hyped the whole thing up as a BFD. But, students aware of the actual changes might have been left asking what all the noise is about.
This is the deal (from your very own impartial observer): While in the past, cheating cases were heard exclusively by a group of “grownups” on the Administrative Board, the shifting of responsibility to the half-undergraduate Honor Council is an attempt to involve students more in the decision making process and make academic integrity a larger part of campus discourse. Ultimately, those driving the transition are hoping for a culture change that will eliminate any future scandals, and broader student involvement is a key first step on that path.
What does this mean down the road?
