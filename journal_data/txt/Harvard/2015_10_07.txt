After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wherever Pope Francis goes, people follow. That was certainly the case throughout his whirlwind six-day tour of Washington, D.C, New York, and Philadelphia that wrapped up last week. Dozens of moving anecdotes popped up every time he stopped his open-air Jeep popemobile to kiss a baby wearing a miniature mitre or a bless a person in a wheelchair. Members of Congress weren't even able to maintain their composure. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) cried and Rep. Bob Brady (D-Pa.) walked up to the stage and pilfered a glass of water the 78-year-old pontiff drank during his historic speech in front of a joint session of Congress. But down in Philadelphia, hundreds of thousands—including many Harvard students (and me)—waited in lines for hours hoping to catch a glimpse of the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.
I was fortunate enough to see the Pope in his little black Fiat from ten feet away. After walking through a security barrier just as state troopers moved to close the street, I got closer to the Pope than I ever could have expected. As he drove right in front of me, his presence was palpable. Even though he looked physically exhausted as he waved from the back seat of his tiny car, he still projected an energy that was invigorating to the lucky few hundred who found themselves on that small street.
But the few fleeting glances we all got last week cannot be the end of what this country gets out of its papal visit. If that's the case, we will have missed the entire point of the visit. As easy as it is to turn these anecdotal glances into viral clickbait, deeper reflection is necessary. For the holder of a position not renowned—it seems to me—for being a positive political force, Pope Francis sure knew how to work Washington, interacting with politicians while still prioritizing the poor and marginalized he preaches about. After all, the United States was not even his first destination this week. He stopped in Cuba to bring his message to a country in need of renewed diplomatic relations with the US.
Although the pope’s entrance through Cuba sends a strong message, his original plan was even stronger. Christians often cite a verse from the Gospel of Matthew proclaiming, “The last shall be first, and the first shall be last.” Pope Francis’s visit put this into practice in a stunningly moving way, visiting a poor country first and declining an invitation to eat with politicians in favor of a meal with the homeless. Before settling on Cuba, Pope Francis considered entering the United States by walking across the Mexican border in a show of solidarity with those immigrating to this country in search of a better future.
Imagine what a powerful image that would have been: As Washington fights its way through a bitter primary process where immigration is a key issue, having a beloved pope walk across the border could have revolutionized the immigration dialogue both here and around the world. Still, Pope Francis was able to contribute to the immigration dialogue, directly addressing immigration in several important speeches where thousands cheered as he preached a doctrine of love and respect for immigrants.
But of course, that leaves the issue of his controversial meeting with Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses. Despite claims otherwise from her lawyers, the Vatican clarified that the meeting was hardly private, not arranged by the pontiff himself, and does not constitute an endorsement of Kim Davis’s views. Pope Francis, however, did arrange one meeting personally, calling a former student who is gay and married to a man.
As much as liberals would like to believe an imminent change in church doctrine is coming, Pope Francis has made it clear once again this week that he believes marriage is between one man and one woman. Still, neither of his meetings should be what we remember about the visit. This pope has made it clear that his first role is to be a pastor, and good pastors have an obligation first and foremost to love everyone—regardless of whether they agree with their lifestyle. That’s why love is what we must remember from this visit. As I stood there with the throngs of screaming people lining the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, it was clear to me that his flock is as strong as ever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal judge ruled last week that inmates at a private prison in Mississippi will be allowed to file a class-action suit against the prison. Inmates at the prison—East Mississippi Correctional Facility—have complained of various issues, ranging from squalid conditions and lack of medical care to excessive force used by prison guards. The facility is run by Management & Training Corporation, which operates 24 prisons nationwide, including three others in Mississippi. One of those three, Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, has also been plagued in the past by issues of violence between and against inmates.
The issues at East Mississippi and Walnut Grove are not unique. Private prisons across the country have been inundated with accusations of mistreatment of prisoners and poor conditions. Moreover, privatization represents just one way in which special interests are exerting a negative influence on the administration of prisons. Prison guard unions have also done a good deal of harm to the state of justice in America’s correctional facilities. That both private prisons and guards unions are seeking to make a profit off of the incarceration of Americans is unethical. Further, it exacerbates the problems that our criminal justice system ought to solve, rather than helping improve the situation.
Both of these special interest groups focus on priorities that disregard the adequate treatment of prisoners. Public officials typically claim that the purpose of privatizing correctional facilities is a desire to cut costs; the problem lies in the companies’ desire to reduce expenses in order to maximize their profits. Profit-driven prisons often have a tendency to lower wages for prison staff, to make less frequent improvements to infrastructure, and to provide substantially poorer quality of medical care—all factors that lead to worse prison conditions and greater incidents of prisoner violence.
Similarly, the power of guard unions, which works to the benefit of prison guards’ salaries, often has a detrimental effect on prisons and prisoners. For example, the California Correction Peace Officer’s Association has long supported tougher sentencing laws in an attempt to increase the number of prisoners, and thus prison guards; some argue that the union’s political influence has prevented prison reform, even when the union has faced accusations of cover-ups of guard abuse. Similarly, the New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Association has repeatedly fought fiercely to protect union members accused of prisoner abuse from dismissal.
The examples of these two prison guard unions show clearly the ways in which special interest groups act counter to the interests of the public good. Our criminal justice system is meant to correct wrongful behavior and encourage future good behavior; it is not supposed to be a place for abuse or neglect. Neither prison guard unions nor private prison companies adhere to this goal—instead, they act for their own betterment. No longer should they serve an outsized role in this nation’s criminal justice system.

Dear XYZ,
I was eating dinner alone in Leverett dining hall the other night. Uninteresting meal. Uninteresting evening. I was minding my business, humming to myself, enjoying a brief break from emails, texts, and conversations.
You waltzed in with a swagger that could shame a Calvin Klein model. You saw your friends at a nearby table—the table directly behind me. You approached them.
“Sup, fags?”
“Hey, faggot, how you been?”
“Pretty good, fag, pretty good.”
You said the word three different times.
My muscles tensed. I gripped my fork too tightly. I wanted to stand and confront you. Ultimately, frustratingly, I didn’t. And I had my reasons: You and your friends were all easily 6’2" with muscles like melons, while I am 5’8" at best and considerably less intimidating; I was scared that you would dismiss my complaint with a harsh sneer, or at best a hurtful indifference; and it felt off kilter to cause a momentary scene over our chicken and broccoli penne in the middle of Leverett dining hall.
You, in all likeliness, thought nothing of saying a word like “faggot.” As a blissfully unaware heterosexual (which I’ll take the risk in assuming you were after hearing your unnecessary discussion of the tits on some girl at a party this past weekend), you have no connection to a term that for ages has been used to diminish and delegitimize an entire community of people. To you, it's just a term of emasculation, a harmless jab at a friend.
But like so many words in the English language that are no longer acceptable to toss around in casual conversation, your use of the word “faggot” has nothing to do with what it means to you and everything to do with what it means to me. My peers. The community of faggots at large.
True story time. On June 22, 1977, a gay man named Robert Hillsborough attended a disco club in San Francisco with his friend, Jerry Taylor. A little after midnight, after stopping at a burger place near Robert's house, they were followed by four young men until they parked their car, at which point the four men attacked them. Taylor managed to flee, but Hillsborough did not. He was beaten to the ground and stabbed 15 times in the face and chest by a man named John Cordova. As he stabbed Hillsborough, Cordova was reported as repeatedly shouting, “Faggot! Faggot!”
“Sup, fags?”
Now let me bring some other people to mind that you may have never even heard of. Matthew Shepard. Emonie Spaulding. Brandon Teena. Harvey Milk. These people were faggots like Robert Hillsborough. Like me. They're dead now, too, murdered by those who disagreed so strongly with who they were that they chose to end their lives for them. Many of their deaths were equally gruesome and humiliating, coupling insult and injury in some of the most inhumane fashions conceivable.
I was not present at any of them. I don’t know the specifics of their deaths beyond what newspapers and law proceedings say.
But look me in the eye and explain to me how you can freely throw around a word that was, at one point, the last thing an innocent person ever heard before being murdered.
Inherent in your petty attempts at emasculation are much harsher, subtler truths: that you consider faggots to be below you. That femininity is something to be ashamed of while masculinity is a point of pride. That, even in jest, reducing your fellow privileged person to the status of the underprivileged is how you get your rocks off. That you have no problem perpetuating the perceived inferiority of an entire minority group of people since you’re not one of them and you don’t have to deal with the detrimental effects such actions perpetuate. Effects like a stab in the face for committing the crime of being alive.
And if you think for one second that Robert Hillsborough’s case doesn’t hold weight because it happened a long time ago, and that in today’s day and age of nationwide marriage equality the faggots have it easier, I invite you to spend five seconds on Google. There were 1,402 hate crimes committed based on sexual orientation in 2013 alone, accounting for over 20 percent of all hate crimes nationwide. More than half of states do not have statewide legislation protecting LGTBQ individuals from employment, housing, and public discrimination. 2015 is on track to break a record for the most LGTBQ homicides in a single year.
These are not problems of the past, but glaring issues facing the faggot community in the present and immediate future, and your poor choice of words affirms this. Our problems cannot be solved in a day. You or I cannot solve them alone. They may even taper asymptotically such that they’re never fully resolved.
But progress begins with small steps. Steps like creating a safer, less aggressive, less hateful environment on Harvard’s campus.
I am a student in good standing at this school, just like you. We both have a right to sit in Leverett dining hall and eat our penne, live our lives, feel like we have a home here without experiencing the burn of a fresh, hot slur on our backs—shrapnel from an explosion you didn't even know you were making, or worse, knew you were making and didn’t care.
There is weight in the words you let loose into the air. There is power in the connections they have to the past. There is pain in the damage you do when you choose to be ignorant and uncaring. I invite you, and anyone like you who uses the word "faggot" despite their heterosexual privilege, to take a long, hard look at why you feel the need to sink so low. And then I invite you to grow up and be better. Because there is an entire community of people, both dead and still surviving, that deserves that from you.
Most sincerely,
A hot and bothered faggot

Response, a group of Harvard students who counsel peers on topics related to relationships, including sexual harassment and assault, has temporarily suspended its hotline and counseling services, citing the need to rest following the release of campus sexual assault survey results late last month.
Response closed on Sunday, and it will reopen on Oct. 12, Columbus Day, according to Lucia R.I. Millham ’16, the group’s co-director.
“Our staffers need to rest after a busy and difficult beginning to Fall semester,” Millham wrote in an email. “While we strongly wish to be as available to the community as possible, we felt it was important to give our staffers the time to take care of themselves, in part so that they can continue to provide quality service.”
Harvard released its results of a sexual assault climate survey in late September after the Association of American Universities administered it at 27 universities nationwide. Harvard’s results revealed levels of sexual assault on campus that top administrators deemed “deeply troubling.”
 Thirty-one percent of senior female undergraduates at the College surveyed reported having experienced some kind of sexual misconduct—what the survey termed “nonconsensual sexual contact”—during their time at Harvard. Sixteen percent of female Harvard College seniors surveyed, meanwhile, said they had experienced unwanted sexual penetration or attempted penetration involving physical force or incapacitation in that time.
Vegas L. Longlois ’16, one of Response’s co-directors, declined to comment on whether more students have sought counseling from the service since the release of the survey statistics, but she wrote in an email that the group saw an increase in requests for their counselors to attend events such as community discussions on the survey results.
At least one other student support service has also seen higher demand after the survey. Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response “has experienced an uptick not only in hotline calls, but also in requests for programming and interest in volunteering” since the release of the survey results, according to Alicia Oeser, OSAPR’s director.
Oeser added in an email that she supports Response’s decision to close temporarily. Millham encouraged students to reach out to OSAPR and other peer counseling services during the group’s break.
Continued discussion about the survey results comes as the College is under federal investigation into its compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. Harvard recently overhauled the way it handles sexual assault complaints by creating a centralized office to investigate cases across the University.

UPDATED: October 7, 2015, at 3:50 a.m.
After closing Stillman Infirmary and moving to restructure after-hours patient care, Harvard University Health Services treated 14 students for reasons related to alcohol after hours in the first three weeks of school.
That figure, according to Donald Perlo, the medical director of UHS urgent care, marks a decline from last year in the same period, when UHS treated 33 students for alcohol after hours. 
Of the 14 students, UHS estimates that 13 were freshmen, Perlo said. One intoxicated student, an upperclassman, was transferred to Mt. Auburn Hospital.
Only two students visited UHS’s after-hours care seeking treatment for intoxication during this year’s freshman orientation week, a slight departure from last year, when seven intoxicated students, and five freshmen, received treatment during orientation.
This summer, Harvard closed all 10 overnight observation beds housed in Stillman, a 24-hour inpatient space that often serviced intoxicated students who reported to UHS for nighttime care under the College’s amnesty policy.
Under restructuring and modified patient procedures implemented this school year, intoxicated Harvard students are no longer sent back to UHS if first processed elsewhere. Students are now also only kept under medical supervision until deemed “clinically sober”—meaning they must show vital signs and be alert, able to ingest food and fluids, and able to walk before leaving. Previously, students were released from observation based on blood alcohol content and had to receive clearance from an internal medicine doctor.
These changes, Perlo said, mean to reduce the amount of time that intoxicated students spend at UHS so that it can free up space for other patients seeking urgent care.
During the same three-week period in 2014, and prior to this shift in procedure, only 19 of the 33 total alcohol-related incidents seen at UHS were originally treated on Harvard’s campus. The other 14 were first seen at Mt. Auburn and other medical facilities before returning to UHS for further treatment.
As of Sept. 21, 2015, 38 students had been sent from UHS to an emergency room off campus. By the same weekend in 2014, 65 students had been transferred to another medical facility.
Overall, 666 total students received treatment at UHS after-hours care in the first three weeks of this fall semester, and 138 were freshmen.

Dubbing 2015 the “Year of the Podcast,” panelists at a Berkman Center for Internet and Society lunch discussion pulled back the curtain on the history of the digital media form and discussed its future.
Titled “State of the Podcast,” the panel is one of many events under the umbrella of HUBweek, a weeklong series sponsored by Harvard, MIT, The Boston Globe, and Massachusetts General Hospital.
Christopher Lydon, the host of Radio Open Source and a former Berkman Center fellow, began the discussion by reading a transcript from the first podcast he recorded more than 10 years ago about the medium itself.
“[A podcast] has the full range of human curiosity and passion about it. A lot of it is funny, feminist, futurist, cosmopolitan, confident, and all those other good buzzy things like edgy, enthusiastic, highly energized,” Lyndon said. “It’s everything I could have hoped for when I went into journalism.”
According to Daniel Jones, who co-hosts and produces the weekly Berkman Center podcast, podcast development commenced in the early 2000s, and Harvard affiliates like Lyndon played a prominent role in its early days.
Kerri Hoffman of PRX, an Internet marketplace for the distribution and licensing of public radio programming, added that although podcasts were originally tied to radio and broadcasting groups due the need for equipment, talent, and audience, podcasts are now beginning to cut those ties.
“In my opinion, the thread between public radio and podcasts doesn’t exist,” said panelist Benjamen Walker, the host of Radiotopia’s “Theory of Everything” podcast. “There is something to this actual medium itself. It’s different than radio. You can’t use the same tricks.”
Jake Shapiro, CEO of PRX and a former Berkman Center associate director, attributed the rise of podcasts’ popularity to the release of the iPhone.
“It took a second, then those of us in radio and broadcasting realized ‘Oh my God, those are radios,’” Shapiro said. “Mobile could finally fix the problem of audio being a bad fit for the internet. Podcasting was always possible, but now it was also viable. That really transformed the game.”
However, Lana Swartz, an attendee and current Berkman fellow who said podcasts represented a significant part of her “daily soundtrack,” raised doubts about the superiority of podcasts to public radio, a sentiment expressed by some of the panelists.
“When I lived in LA and commuted by car regularly, I listened to local radio, which made me feel truly connected to my community,” Swartz said. “Now that I live in a walking city, I’m listening to podcasts more and local media less, and so I find myself less attached to this community.”
For her part, Hoffman considers how podcasts can empower individual journalists and encourage large media corporations to evolve.
“It would be very horrible to live in a society where all media is controlled by a small number of corporations,” Hoffman said. “The podcast is a reminder to public broadcasting that they need to make better news, produce better shows, and stop being vanilla ice cream all the time.”

Kennedy School of Government professor Calestous Juma did not disclose his connection to biotechnology giant Monsanto in a December 2014 paper supporting genetically modified organisms.
The paper, titled “Global Risks of Rejecting Agricultural Biotechnology,” was published on the website of the Genetic Literacy Project, and argues that agriculture should be “viewed as a knowledge-based entrepreneurial activity” and that African policymakers should “consider whether overregulation of GMOs is warranted.”
According to The Boston Globe, Monsanto regulatory policy and scientific affairs head Eric Sachs suggested the topic to Juma in August 2013 email correspondence, including recommendations for the brief’s contents and title.
“The specific goal is to frame some of the important issues facing biotechnology with reasoned thoughtful messages in a way that helps thought leaders and influencers to better appreciate the growing body of knowledge available on the safety and benefits of GM crops,” Sachs wrote in the email to Juma, published by Mother Jones. In the message, Sachs wrote that public relations firm CMA Consulting would oversee the production of the policy papers to avoid any direct involvement from Monsanto.
“We recognize and support the value of faculty engagement with outside organizations—governments, nonprofits, and corporations—in order to understand and solve public problems,” Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an emailed statement. “At the same time, as a school devoted to advancing the public interest, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity.”
Gavel said Juma was not paid by Monsanto for his article and that the article published for the Genetic Literacy Project drew from a 2011 book authored by Juma, as well as earlier testimony before a congressional subcommittee in July 2014.
The University’s conflict of interest policy, last amended in 2012, focuses entirely on financial conflicts of interest, defined as “a set of circumstances that reasonable observers would believe creates an undue risk that an individual’s judgment or actions regarding a primary interest of the University will be inappropriately influenced by a secondary financial interest.”
“The HKS administration will continue to work to increase awareness and implementation of this important university policy, and further, to ensure that faculty, scholars and the Kennedy School more broadly maintain public trust,” Gavel wrote in his statement.
Juma did not respond to requests for comment.

Despite the University of Pennsylvania’s decision to rebrand its financial aid program as “all-grant” instead of “no-loan”—reflecting complaints that many Penn students do, in fact, take out external loans—Harvard’s financial aid department will continue to tout its “no-loan” policies to applicants.
Prior to Penn’s decision to rename its program in August, both Harvard and Penn referred to their financial aid programs as “no-loan,” meaning that their aid packages replaced undergraduate student loans with university-funded grants.
Last year, however, Penn student groups criticized the University’s “no-loan” characterization of its policies, arguing that some still took out loans to cover costs not addressed in their financial aid packages.
While Penn responded by changing its policies—in name only—to “all-grant,” Harvard still considers the “no-loan” branding integral to its financial aid program, Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said. 
“We have found that talking about ‘no loan required’ is a key element of how we reach out to students,” Fitzsimmons said in an interview that Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane also attended. “The words ‘free’ and ‘no loan’ really resonate.”
Still, according to Sally C. Donahue, Harvard’s financial aid director, close to 30 percent of Harvard’s Class of 2015—about 300 students—took out loans during their time at Harvard. For those who received need-based grant aid, the average student debt at graduation was just over $5,200, significantly less than the national average of $35,051.
“It is our hope that their postgraduate plans not be affected by the financial constraints posed by a more typical student debt level,” Donahue wrote in an email.
While Harvard’s financial aid website says students are not expected to take out loans as part of their financial aid package, it also notes that some “may choose to pursue loans to help cover [their] student or family contribution.”
Given the frequency with which students borrow, even at “no-loan” schools, David Mainiero, the director of college counseling at InGenius Prep, said he was skeptical of how many universities brand their financial aid programs.
“I don’t think that colleges or institutions of higher education should be using what amounts to, at worst, Orwellian doublespeak. At best, it’s marketing language,” Mainiero said. “An asterisk isn’t enough; they need to be upfront with people about what they can afford.”
Fitzsimmons said the “no-loan” label can be attention-grabbing, but added that he tries to explain Harvard’s financial aid program in more detail in his conversations with potential applicants.
“Lots of students are now getting information on their mobile phones. That means we have about eight seconds to get the point across,” Fitzsimmons said. “But the more ways we can describe what we do, the better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust opened up her office to student visitors for an hour on Monday, and a group of undergraduates used the meeting to approach her with concerns about sexual assault at Harvard and the results of the sexual climate survey that Faust herself deemed “deeply troubling.”
Faust will hold student office hours just four times this school year, according to a schedule posted to Harvard’s website, and one session is set for the Longwood Medical Area across the Charles. On Monday afternoon, several students from Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy group, took advantage of the infrequent opportunity to discuss the climate surrounding sexual assault at Harvard with Faust, who has made the issue a recent priority of her presidency. 
According to Drisana M. Mosaphir ’17, a member of the group, students asked Faust about sexual assault training for students, staff, and faculty at the College.
Specifically, they asked if these College affiliates could be trained not only to advocate consensual sex, but also to inform students about the logistics surrounding sexual assault response at Harvard. That would include familiarizing students with the role of the centralized Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution—which investigates complaints—and the reporting process, as well as which resources offer students confidentiality, Mosaphir wrote in an email.
Results of a recent survey on sexual assault at Harvard, released late last month, showed that a majority of Harvard student respondents were not at all or only a little bit knowledgeable about what happens when a student reports an incident of sexual assault or misconduct. The survey demonstrated that many students distrust Harvard’s response to sexual assault on campus.
In addition to discussing resources and training with Faust, Mosaphir said the group of students called for greater levels of student input into Harvard’s own sexual assault policies, asking for a student policy review committee that could clear up confusion about Harvard’s protocols.
“We've found that a lot of the language in [Harvard’s policies] is difficult for students without prior background in law… or the necessary time to digest a long document to understand,” Mosaphir wrote in an email.
In the past, students—including members of Our Harvard Can Do Better—have criticized administrators for what they argued was insufficient inclusion of student voices in the policymaking process.
Faust’s reactions to the student group’s concerns, Mosaphir said, were generally positive. But Mosaphir added that she would have preferred to have had a more concrete discussion about improving Harvard’s handling of sexual assault.
“While it was good to receive validation on some of our thoughts, we feel that students would also benefit from knowing what actions will be taken,” she wrote.
Overall, though, both Faust and Mosaphir said they found the office hour a beneficial experience.
In her monthly interview with The Crimson Tuesday, Faust said she “greatly benefited” from the exchange with the student group. She hopes to increase transparency about sexual assault and student resources at Harvard, Faust added, through both a “communications campaign” and meetings with student groups like Our Harvard Can Do Better.
“I will be having more meetings with individual groups around campus just to listen and hear and emphasize how important these issues are,” Faust said.
The College is currently under federal investigation into its compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX, after Our Harvard Can Do Better filed a complaint with the Department of Education.

Citing the “troubling” percentage of women who leave the Faculty of Arts and Sciences before they are up for final tenure review, top administrators on Tuesday decried departmental culture and a lack of mentorship as major factors behind women’s departures from Harvard.
“We’re not doing enough to build a strong enough environment to make sure the women in this case feel they have the best long term support for their careers,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in an interview after the semester’s first Faculty meeting on Tuesday afternoon.
In interviews with tenure-track women who were leaving Harvard, administrators found a “striking” reason for their departure was an uncomfortable culture in their respective departments, according to the school’s annual report, which administrators presented at the meeting.
Only 66 percent of women on schedule to be considered for promotions to become full professors last year remained at Harvard for the final stage of that process, compared with 78 percent of men. That gap is widening, said FAS Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser, who presented the data on Tuesday.
 Tenure track women in FAS have the lowest level of overall satisfaction with their experience compared to women of the same professional cohort from any other Harvard school, Zipser said. They also report higher levels of stress than their male counterparts.
Zipser also noted that the majority of women who depart FAS before their final tenure reviews stay in academia, leaving Harvard for other universities.
Reacting to the trend, administrators plan to create more leadership workshops for tenure track faculty, add symposia for tenure-track women in different divisions, increase the amount of day care provided to FAS affiliates, and review departmental mentoring programs.
Smith said after the meeting that he and other administrators will focus on gathering information from departments about the types of support and mentoring they offer their faculty.
Several faculty members, including Classics professor Richard F. Thomas and History professor Charles S. Maier ’60, a former Crimson editorial chair, asked questions about the statistics and expressed concern that last year, a third of women up for their final tenure review left Harvard before the process could complete.
At the meeting, Smith also briefly commented on the “deeply disturbing” results of last spring’s sexual assault climate survey, administered at Harvard and 26 other universities nationwide. The results, released late last month, indicate that nearly a third of surveyed senior women at Harvard College said they had experienced some form of sexual misconduct since matriculating.
Smith said FAS is currently planning faculty programs to help prevent sexual assault, including faculty training, Title IX information sessions, and Title IX coordinator meetings with department representatives.
Additionally, administrators are currently searching for someone to fill a new Title IX coordinator position for faculty affairs and graduate students. “I think we’re fairly close to hiring someone,” Smith said after the meeting.
To close off the meeting on Tuesday, faculty members discussed new Faculty Council elections procedures and the progress of the General Education review committee, which hopes to finalize a proposal and recommendations for the College’s core curriculum by the end of the semester for faculty vote. Faculty met for a town hall on the program last week and will meet three more times this semester to discuss it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rahsaan D. Hall, the racial justice program director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts who defended Harvard’s consideration of race as a factor in its admissions processes, spoke of his law career to students Tuesday evening. Hall’s defense comes in light of a lawsuit against the University claiming that its affirmative action policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
Prior to joining the ACLU this summer, Hall was the deputy director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, a pro bono legal group that filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit on behalf of Harvard. The group’s intervention cited as its movants nine prospective and five current Harvard students who stated an interest in “living and studying in a racially diverse environment.”
Speaking to an audience of about a dozen students in Winthrop House’s Junior Common Room, Hall maintained that Harvard’s holistic admissions processes were in compliance with the legal precedent set by the Supreme Court.
“There is a benefit to having a diverse, colorful, unique student population,” Hall said. “Yes, it’s Harvard; yes, you want the best and brightest, but SAT, GPA, and class rank are not the only determiners of who that is.”
While the Lawyer’s Committee was denied the ability to formally intervene, Hall said that the group was awarded amicus status, allowing them to file relevant briefs for the consideration of the court.
Hall also discussed a number of other social and political justice issues that he had encountered in his law career. Commenting on voter identification laws, Hall questioned whether statistical evidence supports the prevalence of voter fraud.
“People have a greater likelihood of being struck by lightning than someone impersonating another person at the polls,” said Hall, who has worked on cases about voter registration. “The whole notion of the ‘voter integrity movement’ is a ruse to get to the real issue of denying people, most of whom are inclined to vote progressively, access to the polls.”
Recalling some of the most memorable trials he has worked on, Hall described one homicide case in which a 17-year-old boy was convicted of the murder of a 14-year-old following a disagreement over a baseball cap. While his prosecution team won the trial, Hall said he was troubled by the severity of the convicted boy’s punishment.
“At a moment when you think you should celebrate... it was terribly sad because there is a now 19-year-old going to jail for the rest of his life,” he said.
The mother of the killed boy, Hall added, later became an advocate for restorative justice, an approach focused on repairing the harm done to communities instead of punishing offenders.
“That’s pretty powerful to me,” he said.

University President Drew G. Faust called for the College’s General Education program to remain a symbol of liberal arts education at the meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on Tuesday afternoon.
During her remarks, Faust publicly added her own thoughts about reforming the beleaguered program as the Faculty discusses reforms ahead of a major vote, expected at the end of this semester, emphasizing the importance of the review process in the larger context of higher education nationwide.
Now is “a time when liberal arts education is under increasing criticism nationwide and when the purposes of colleges are so often misconstrued and understood in narrowly vocational terms,” she said, calling a broad education “the hallmark of the undergraduate experience at this University throughout most of its history.”
Faust presented four “general principles” to guide the development of the curriculum. By the time they graduate from Harvard, Faust said, undergraduates should be required to have a broad education, have the opportunity to pursue many elective courses, be able to “write clearly and elegantly,” and be “mathematically literate.” Lastly, she said, Gen Ed should underscore innovative teaching, “the very best of pedagogy.”
The comments come as the Gen Ed review committee hosts a series of town hall meetings for the Faculty regarding the program, which the committee’s draft report stated was “failing on a variety of fronts.”
Since that draft was presented at the last Faculty meeting in May, the review committee met over the summer and in September, speaking with department chairs, the Gen Ed committee, and other faculty members, according to Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly, the committee’s chair. He has said the committee intends to finalize a proposal by the end of the semester for a faculty vote.
Open only to faculty members, town hall meetings will take place the next three Tuesdays to continue discussions on Gen Ed. At the Faculty meeting on Tuesday, Kelly said next week’s town hall will focus on the philosophical principles of the program.
The committee’s draft report offered faculty members three different possible options from which to choose: a simple distribution requirement, offering a mix of Gen Ed courses and distribution requirements, or clarifying existing principles and reforming the program within that context.
Faculty members have said they are overall committed to reforming Gen Ed within the existing principles of engaging with broader questions and understanding the intellectual pursuit more broadly, rather than replacing the program altogether.

The University filed plans for Harvard Business School’s new Klarman Hall and G2 Pavilion development projects with the Boston Redevelopment Authority on Friday.
The two buildings, according to the plans, will replace the existing Burden Hall building with around 105,100 square feet of new construction, approximately 35,000 square feet smaller than the project approved in the University’s 2013 Institutional Master Plan.
Construction on Klarman Hall is expected to finish by August of 2018, and the three-story facility will house a 1,000-seat auditorium—enough to accommodate an entire MBA class. Klarman will also feature a more “welcoming” design, in contrast to Burden Hall, which the documents describe as “a windowless building lacking a positive relationship with campus open spaces, pedestrian paths, and buildings.” The design of the G2 Pavilion, which will be connected to Klarman Hall, is still under development.
According to the filed plans, the “Project will be clad in brick, with a level of pattern and detail consistent with many of the core campus buildings.” The architectural style of the building will emphasize the Business School’s tradition of Georgian architecture; large, open windows will underscore the “public character of the Project.”
William Rawn Associates are the project architects, and Walsh Brothers Construction is charged with managing the project.
The Harvard-Allston Task Force was briefed on the preliminary designs of the two buildings three weeks ago.

Wendy R. Sherman, a former State Department official who served as the lead American negotiator of the nuclear deal reached between Iran and a group of six countries led by the U.S., spoke candidly about the historic diplomatic effort at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday night.
The Iran Deal would significantly restrict Iran’s nuclear capability for the next 10 to 15 years, limiting plutonium production and uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. The international agreement has faced criticism in the U.S., but Senate Democrats blocked a Republican resolution to reject the deal in September.
“The President’s charge to all of us was that we had to make sure that Iran would not be able to obtain a nuclear weapon … that we could be assured that its program was exclusively peaceful and that we had shut down all the pathways for different materials for a nuclear weapon ... and we believe we have done that,” Sherman said at the event, which was moderated by David E. Sanger ’82, a national security correspondent for The New York Times and an adjunct lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government.
Multiple times during the forum, the discussion turned toward more controversial portions of the agreement. Sherman addressed topics ranging from the concessions to allow Iran to keep a limited enrichment program, Iran’s human rights record, and Israel’s opposition to the deal.
“We made a decision. It is a debate one can have. But the decision President [Obama] made was that a destabilized Middle East—a chaotic, a difficult, a painful Middle East—would be even worse if Iran had a nuclear weapon,” Sherman said.
“That is a strategic debate, but I agree with the president,” she added.
While Sherman said she remains hopeful that the deal is a major step forward, she acknowledged that there is still much work left to be done.
“We’re very proud of what we’ve done, but there is a very long road ahead, and this is all based on verification, on monitoring, this is not based on trust,” Sherman said. “After decades of mistrust, you don’t solve that in two years or four years. It’s going to take a substantial amount of time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 8, 2015, at 2:56 a.m.
After another year of lackluster returns at Harvard Management Company, University President Drew G. Faust said Tuesday that she is concerned about the company’s performance and hopeful that new HMC CEO Stephen Blyth can return the fund to the top tier of institutional investors. 
Though HMC earned returns of 5.8 percent in fiscal year 2015 and increased Harvard’s endowment to $37.6 billion, nearly all of its peer institutions bested the company in endowment performance. Yale, Princeton, and MIT doubled Harvard, returning 11.5 percent, 12.7 percent, and 13.2 percent on their respective endowments. Harvard did fare better than the University of Texas System, the second largest endowment, and the Standard and Poor’s 500 index.
“We obviously did not do as well as MIT and Yale and others, and that of course is a concern, and it's very much a concern for Stephen Blyth, who has been making significant changes,” Faust said in an interview on Tuesday.
Harvard has a lot at stake when it comes to investment performance. Just a 5 percent difference in HMC’s returns—which in fiscal year 2015 did not account for the gap between Harvard and the top endowments—is the equivalent of close to $2 billion, nearly a third of Harvard’s record-seeking $6.5 billion capital campaign. The $2 billion figure could also cover the entire House renewal budget and hundreds of new professorships. The annual budget for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard’s flagship teaching and research body, was $1.3 billion last year.
HMC’s underperformance is not new. From FY 2009 to FY 2013, under the leadership of former HMC CEO Jane L. Mendillo, Harvard’s returns ranked last in the Ivy League, according to an analysis from Charles Skorina, who manages a firm that recruits chief investment officers and financial executives. Another Skorina analysis compared compensation to performance over the same period, ranking Mendillo—the best paid endowment executive in the study—last in the Ivy League.
Blyth, in his first year as CEO, has pledged changes to HMC’s structure and compensation, sharing plans last month to tie pay more strongly to the fund’s overall performance. Blyth also set a goal to notch returns in the top quartile of the 10 most valuable University endowments.
That is a benchmark that Harvard used to meet easily, but HMC has not achieved it since FY 2008.
That underperformance has worried observers.
“I look forward to seeing Steven Blyth's plans for what I hope will be major change at HMC,” former University President Lawrence H. Summers, now a University professor, wrote in an email Tuesday night. “The fact that Harvard’s performance has lagged our peers by ever increasing amounts since the financial crisis is deeply troubling. The quality of the endowment's performance, far more than fundraising, will determine whether Harvard remains preeminent."
Skorina urged critics to give Blyth time to make changes.
“You have got to give him five years,” Skorina said.“They gave [Mendillo] five years, the returns were average to mediocre; she left.”
Skorina also said Yale’s investment head—David F. Swensen—has done more with fewer resources. “With a third the salary and a seventh the staff, Swensen consistently seems to produce significantly higher returns,” Skorina said.
Harvard pays its financiers far more than Yale. In 2012, Mendillo made $4.8 million, while Swensen made $2.9 million.
“If you deliver 13.2 percent, you should be paid for it. If you deliver 5.8 percent, you don’t deserve top quartile pay for third quartile performance,” Skorina said.
Though Faust said the University has “a ways to go” with its returns, she expressed full confidence in the direction in which Blyth is leading HMC. She said she communicates with Blyth frequently, meeting with him monthly and talking constantly outside official settings.
In the past month, HMC has seen some personnel change. Andrew G. Wiltshire announced retirement plans from his alternative assets managership, and last week, two high-level HMC executives departed with little notice. Faust said the departures were a natural byproduct of the transition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior forwards Midge Purce and Rachel Garcia do not usually spend much time on the bench, but it paid off for the Harvard women’s soccer team on Tuesday night.
In the Crimson’s final nonconference game of the season, the duo did not enter the game until the 32nd minute. But the pair took advantage of their time on their field, combining for two goals in less than five minutes early in the second half to lift the Crimson (5-6-1, 2-0-0 Ivy) to a 2-1 victory over a red-hot Boston University team (5-5-3, 3-0-1 Patriot) at Nickerson Field in Boston. It was the first come-from-behind win for Harvard this season.
“[Holding them to one goal] was huge,” junior forward Joan Fleischman said. “One goal is one goal, and I think it would have been easy to put our heads down and choose to think about Cornell, but it was huge that we picked our heads up and took a breath and held them to that one goal so we could come back in the second half.”
Harvard went with a different starting lineup than the one it used to pick up victories against Penn and Yale. The starters included six underclassmen, including three freshmen. After BU went up 1-0 following a Christina Wakefield goal off of a free kick, five of the Crimson’s usual starters, including Garcia and Purce, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Week, checked into the game with 13 minutes left in the first half.
“I think our team really showed a lot of depth today,” Purce said. “Aside from the players who are injured, we’ve had every single player on our team start and that is an incredible thing for a team to be able to do and have no dropoff. I’m just really proud of our team. They played 90 minutes.”
Purce provided an offensive spark right away for Harvard after she and freshman midfielder Zayne Matulis exchanged passes to set up the Crimson’s first shot of the game. Harvard was able to control the ball in the Terriers zone for much of the first half’s final ten minutes as BU began double teaming the Olney, Md., native. However, the Crimson went into halftime trailing, and has only scored the first goal of the game five times this season.
“It’s a really hard thing to [come back], especially against a team like BU,” Purce said. “I think we showed a lot of resilience and a lot of pride.”
While most of the first half saw the Terriers challenge Harvard’s defense, the second 45 minutes were dominated by the Crimson offense. The bend-but-don’t-break defense of BU had been the team’s strength this season. The Terriers had not allowed more than one goal since their last loss, which came against Northeastern on Sept. 3.
Purce, who recorded a hat trick against Yale on Saturday, broke through in the 60th minute. After receiving a long pass from the defensive zone, Purce outran the BU defense and beat Terriers backup goalkeeper Bridget Conway on a breakaway.
Following Purce’s tally, Harvard kept the pressure on the BU defense. After two Crimson corner chances did not find the back of the net, junior forward Rachel Garcia’s strike from outside the box in the 64th minute gave Harvard a 2-1 lead. It was the second game-winning goal of the season for Garcia. The transfer from Georgia also lifted the Crimson to a 2-1 victory against New Hampshire on Sept. 17.
After losing four of its first five games, the Terriers entered Tuesday on a 7-game unbeaten streak, including a 4-0-0 record at home. During that stretch, BU had scored 16 times and outscored its opponents by 11 goals.
The Terriers have been a thorn in the side of Harvard in recent years. The Crimson has gone 1-6-2 during Harvard coach Ray Leone’s tenure, including losses in the first round of the 2011 and 2013 NCAA Tournaments. The Crimson had not beaten BU since 2007 and had not picked up a win at Nickerson Field since 2002.
“Their defense is always good,” Purce said. “Every time, it’s a challenge. We look at film on them and their entire backline is extremely talented. We were able to beat them on a couple things and that was really good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a night where the Harvard men’s soccer team drew 17 fouls against the University of New Hampshire, sophomore free-kick taker Christian Sady was consistently the center of attention.
Sady curled three dangerous crosses into the box Tuesday night at Jordan Field, two of which found the heads of Crimson strikers and one of which even produced a penalty kick. But all three times, Harvard came up empty.
So when the midfielder stepped up to take another free kick in the 55th minute, he elected to try something different.
Following the whistle, Sady quickly pushed the ball ahead to junior midfielder Sam Brown, whose cross into the box provided an opportunity for senior forward Jake Freeman—one that the Crimson’s leading scorer was not going to squander. Bringing the ball to his left foot with his chest, Freeman drove a shot into the lower right corner of the net, lifting Harvard (3-4-2, 1-0-0 Ivy) to a 1-0 win over the previously unbeaten Wildcats (7-1-2, 1-0-0 America East)
“I just happened to be in the right spot,” Freeman said. “So I’m going to keep trying to get in the right spot.”
Through nine games, the senior has found that “right spot” time and time again. Freeman has now scored the game-winning goal in each of the Crimson’s three wins in 2015.
The senior’s fourth goal of the year opened the scoring for Harvard, but not before the game nearly started the same way it finished against Yale on Saturday. After UNH’s Andrew Caput sent senior defenseman Andrew Chang flying in the box in the 23rd minute, the referee pointed to the spot, prompting senior striker Tim Schmoll to step up for a penalty shot.
Schmoll began his run-up, then stuttered, aiming to freeze senior netminder Ryan Carpenter. But Carpenter remained patient, and Schmoll drove a low shot into the outside of the right post, leaving the scoreboard unchanged.
Up until that point, the Crimson had maintained a steady hold on the game, controlling possession for lengthy portions of time in the Wildcats’ half. But Schmoll’s miss activated a UNH onslaught, forcing Harvard, as Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer put it, to “weather the storm” against six consecutive Wildcat shots.
First, senior midfielder Fazal Nabi and junior midfielder Chris Wingate blasted shots just feet away from senior goaltender Evan Mendez. Then rookie midfielder Chris Arling broke through the Harvard defense not once but twice. And minutes later, sophomore midfielder Will Rasid managed to volley a shot from inside the box.
But behind three Mendez saves and a pair of missed targets, the Crimson managed to escape the frame still even with the visitors.
“Evan has been the most consistent in training and preparation and execution on the whole team,” Lehrer said. “He’s been fantastic.”
In the second half, scoring chances became harder to come by, but Freeman put away his chance early in the frame when the ball bounced his way after ricocheting towards the 18-yard line off the head of a leaping UNH defenseman.
“We just wanted to take a deep breath,” Freeman said. “To restart from there, you’ve got to have a short memory. So once we came into halftime, [we thought], ‘Just calm down, we’re going to be fine. Let’s get our chance and put it away.’”
For the remainder of the half, the Wildcats continued to struggle putting away chances. But with four minutes to go, UNH nearly found an answer. After senior defenseman Lukas Goerigk blasted the ball deep into the Harvard zone, classmate defenseman Connor Pauley flicked the ball up the left wing with his head, initiating a last gasp attack.
Rookie midfielder Alex Valencia ran onto the ball, looking to use a burst of speed to blow by senior defenseman Michael Klain. Just as Valencia appeared to gain an edge, Klain bumped the freshman from the side, sending him to the ground inside the penalty area. But the referee opted not to make the call, enabling the Crimson to close out the win.
“We wanted to build off the momentum from the last win in the Ivy League,” Freeman said. “And that’s what we got to keep doing. Wins build momentum, so if we can do that, we feel like we’ll be in a good spot.”
