After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The world is no stranger to the mystery genre. From authors Agatha Christie and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to television series “Twin Peaks” and “True Detective,” murder and mystery stories driven by suspense have kept audiences dying to know what comes next for centuries. But it would appear that it isn’t suspense but rather something else about a mystery that captivates audiences. True-crime stories like This American Life’s “Serial” or Netflix’s “Making a Murderer” have similarly seen a surge in popularity, but unlike their predecessors, a quick Google search will reveal whether the accused was found guilty or not, killing any suspense. The former was the number one podcast not only in the United States but also in the UK and Australia and put the art of the podcast back on the map. The latter garnered about 19 million views within the first month of its release. What is it about these seemingly suspense-less true-crime stories that makes them so popular?
For one, many of these true-crime stories feed into the conversation about race that has dominated in America over the past several years. The first season of “Serial” is a retelling of the murder of Hae Min Lee, a Korean-American teenager supposedly killed by her Pakistani-American ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed. “The People v. O.J. Simpson” follows the well-known trial of the infamous O.J. Simpson, found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife and a waiter. “The Central Park Five” is a 2012 documentary about the five innocent black teenagers convicted of raping a jogger in Central Park. What these all have in common are the minority accused who, innocent or guilty, were vilified during their respective trials, highlighting the underlying racism in America that never really left and has now resurfaced, bigger than ever.
These stories are also very telling about the power of fame and wealth. Robert Durst, subject of HBO’s highly acclaimed “The Jinx,” is the millionaire heir to a real estate fortune, while O.J. Simpson was America’s beloved football star before he was accused of murder. Both avoided guilty convictions—perhaps thanks to their expensive teams of lawyers, calling to attention a major flaw in the American legal and justice system. Give your lawyers a paycheck with enough zeros on it, and you’re more likely to walk away free. On the flip side, these stories also reveal that fame and money don’t provide protection from the tarnished reputations from which the two may never recover.
In the digital age, when everything is accessible literally at one’s fingertips, these stories encourage audiences to step away from the computer screen and do the unthinkable: Wait. Anyone can find out how Adnan Syed’s case culminated with a brief online search, but the possibility for a more intense experience listening to the podcast entices people to avoid doing just that. People seek the thrill of not knowing what’s going to happen next, even when they already do know what happened. The phenomenon these stories have incited proves that the time-old saying—that it’s not about the destination but about the journey—holds true even today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You eat, but you aren’t able to taste your food. You try to write your paper, or work on your p-set, but all you can do is think to yourself, “What is the point?” You try to get out of bed in the morning, but you just can’t escape its almost magnetic hold over you. 
So you sleep. And you sleep. And you sleep. Sleep becomes your drug of choice, and you abuse it constantly. Your old hobbies and passions no longer have the same appeal. None of them match the sense of security you feel when you’re wrapped up tight in your bed sheets. You sleep to escape the thoughts, the fear, the overwhelming sense of hopelessness and dread that seems to seep from your pores.
But when you leave the house, you keep a smile spread on your face, because you know your friends won’t understand. You feel isolated, alone, like there is no one in the world who can possibly understand the darkness. God, you wish and you pray that the pain can go away.
But it doesn’t. It gets worse, and worse, and worse. And then you think to yourself: Should I end it all? Eventually, that’s all that you can think about, that question. And more questions follow. What does it mean to be alive? Why are you here? What’s the point? You drown in these thoughts—you’re drowning, and you feel like no one is there to save you.
This year, our campus has experienced a series of conversations about the issue of mental health in our community. It’s difficult for me to express how thankful I am for these conversations. Harvard can be a wonderful place, but as we all know, it can also be a pressure cooker. For many of us, it was our dream for our entire lives to go to school here, which is why the reality of the mental health situation on this campus can be so startling. This place can be so cold, so isolating. People are so busy all the time that it is easy to feel alone. We have had almost one suicide every year, and the anxiety on this bustling campus is almost palpable. I love Harvard, but the administration and student leadership must continue to improve the mental health condition on this campus.
As part of this process, I believe it is necessary for us to come together, as a campus, to talk about the times when we felt hopeless, when we felt lost. For the sake of those of us living every day in silence and suffering, it is vital for Harvard’s student body to come together and say: You Are Not Alone.
Telling these stories can be difficult. In a place where prestige and face mean so much, the social cost of opening up to people that you don’t know seems like it would be crippling.
I fear the stigma surrounding mental health. I am more than my depression, yet I am afraid that for some people, my mental health condition will be all they associate with my name. But I am certain that our campus desperately needs people to come forward and talk about their mental health. Which is why I will tell you my story.
This past May, John Lee, a friend from back home, committed suicide. My third friend to die in four years, he and I knew each other since we were babies, grew up together, and co-captained our school’s Academic Bowl Team. Our friendship had its ups and downs, as all real friendships do, and right before I left for college we had a falling out, something that I will regret for the rest of my life.
For months after John Lee’s suicide, I was numb. During this time period, I was able to go about my daily life as usual. Between final exams, an intense summer job, and the start of the next semester, I never took the time to process his death. Last semester, likely as a means to avoid coming to terms with the loss of my friend, I filled every minute and every second with school and extracurricular activities. I barely slept, rarely ate, and was always on my feet. I felt that as long as I stayed busy, I could outrun the memories and thoughts that threatened to drag me down into darkness.
By the middle of the semester, though, it proved too much. Like a house built upon sand, my mental health status remained unstable as long as I avoided coming to terms with the death of my friend. Depression hit me like a truckload of bricks, knocking me off my feet and hitting me while I was down again, and again. By never taking the proper time to come to terms with John Lee’s death or the death of my other two friends, I allowed what should have been a natural process of grief to transform into an overwhelming state of depression. I began to question the point of school, of my extracurriculars, even of my own life. My attempts in the first two paragraphs of this article to convey the depths of my emotions are, to be frank, woefully insufficient. Suffice it to say, this was a dark time for me.
My experiences with depression made it necessary for me to take time off. My schoolwork no longer felt relevant, as I was trying my best to stay afloat in a time when just eating and sleeping regularly felt like too much to handle. Ultimately, I decided that the only way for me to overcome the overwhelmingly negative emotions that were consuming my life was to attempt to direct them into a positive outlet. I’ve traveled around, speaking to audiences about my history with mental health, and worked with the public defender’s office in Birmingham, Alabama, where I have seen first hand the ravaging effects of mental health conditions on our nation’s low-income communities. In particular, I’ve seen yet again that many people use their drug or substance of choice as their last refuge, something that occurs on this campus as well.
My time off in Alabama has been transformative. It has allowed me to gain new perspectives on mental health in our society, and, thankfully, to take positive steps in coming to terms with my own demons.
Why did I write this article? It is my sincere and honest belief that we will all encounter a situation in our lives that pushes us into an existential chasm, forcing us to crawl up on our hands and knees to attempt to rediscover the light. I believe this is a basic aspect of humanity, that it is natural. What I fear, however, is that there are some people who feel alone in their struggle. Who feel like there is no hope.
The power of storytelling is tremendous. It brings us together to reflect on our common humanity, something that is easy to forget in an era of smartphones and social media echo chambers. I hope that the story of my experience with depression, and how I almost convinced myself that I was alone—that my life was meaningless—will help people feel comfortable talking about their own experiences. Because the truth is, we are not alone in our mental health struggle, no matter what depression tells us. We are here for each other, we care, and we will listen.

William F. Morris IV ’17-’18 is taking a year off to intern in a public defender's office and advocate for mental health awareness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 11, 2016, 1:32 a.m. 
Last week, America’s wealthiest university found itself wondering what it should do with its money, as the Undergraduate Council debated at length whether it should spend $850 of the Freshman Class Committee’s $10,000 budget on a berry-themed study break. And the UC moved in step with the lot of “constituents” craving berries of the rasp-, straw-, black-, and blue-varieties specifically (though we’ve been informed bananas are berries too, “botanically speaking”), passing the proposal for the event, which drew a crowd of hundreds last Tuesday.
Although all this berry banter does indeed seem silly—if not a pun-opportunity just ripe for the picking—it’s worthwhile to consider an issue that makes its way onto the UC agenda. In this scenario, the UC’s consideration of the Berry Brain Break is, in all seriousness, more fruitful than anything.
Given that the $10,000 given to the Freshman Class Committee is set aside with the intent of being spent over the course of one year on freshmen programming, it is a fund designed for the occasional splurge.
Not to mention, the idea of funding a fresh, seasonal fruit-themed brain break is one worth preserving and maybe even replicating. Instead of randomly handing out fruit to freshmen in Annenberg one night a year, why not make a whole meal out of the concept? Such a study break could be planned in tandem with members of Harvard’s Food Literacy Project and potentially plant seeds of interest in the program among freshmen.
It’s important that this programming spawned the heated debate it did. Indeed, $850 is a considerable sum regardless of who sets it aside and for what purpose they intend it. It is heartening to see that Harvard’s freshmen policymakers took the time to poll their peers regarding what food they wanted to see at a study break, represent them zealously in meetings, and take their spending decisions seriously.
This editorial has been changed to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: April 11
This editorial has been updated to clarify the role of the Freshman Class Committee's budget, which is designed to serve the needs of the class in general and is not just for the purpose of entertainment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was 13 and at the peak of my social justice warrior phase, I believed that being a girl hurt, everyone thought yellow people looked the same, and cat-calling was absolutely horrible. There were a lot of other things I thought, but I probably don’t believe them anymore.
Websites all over the internet say that it’s typical for teenagers to question their sexuality. I’m on the tail-end of teenagedom, but I still do that multiple times a week. I think that means I find life interesting. The number’s up from two weeks ago, because I just got into The Internet. My roommate found them going through her brother’s Spotify. I play Ego Death beginning to end, beginning to end, three or four times a day. It makes an hour feel like nothing. Syd Tha Kyd has a slow kind of look about her. She says “girl” like the wind at the tip of a roller coaster. Her voice sounds worse live. She doesn’t show skin, but her clothes still look like they’re threatening to fall off. If it takes Syd Tha Kyd to turn me queer, I must be the straightest girl I know.
Once, on a trip from the Quad to the Yard, I decided to take an off-route. Since Syd Tha Kyd was telling me to loosen up, I walked slow. I had on a cardigan with an obnoxious amount of faux fur. I got it for $30 at Primark in October because back then it seemed classy. A girl smoking a cig told me she loved my sweater, and I said I loved the pink shoelaces on her Dr. Martens. She asked me what I was doing later, and I told her I was going to study. She told me I didn’t have to be in a box, that I was beautiful enough to make it decently on the streets. I told her that I must be one of those smiling ballerinas in music boxes because sometimes I loved it, the box. She told me her name was Syd. I felt like it was fate. She asked where I lived, and I pointed to Matthews’s tall slick bricks. You’re a Harvard kid, she said, don’t you think it’s your human duty to get people like me off the street?
I said Harvard kids were just in the Bubble. She said she once sold fake heroine to a Harvard kid and the kid came back for more, that you could be smart but just dumb. When we walked to the gate, she asked if I had to go. I said yeah.
The last thing she told me was that ideas never worked, and I shouldn’t let anyone, including Harvard, tell me what I cared or did not care about. Which seemed too perfect, because even if I didn’t agree with her, for a brief moment, I wanted to. Sometimes life’s more about living than what you think about it. Thinking can make you feel good, but it can’t save you.
Before Syd Tha Kyd joined The Internet and started singing about girls, she was part of Odd Future, a group known for its misogynistic and homophobic lyrics. She left in 2010, but it was mostly because she felt lonely, not because of irreconcilable ideological differences. People don’t have to have ideologies to be political. They don’t need to be political to be poetic either.
When we read "Absalom, Absalom!" in class, my TF asked if anyone could ever live their ideology, and I said no, because Martin Luther King Jr. and JFK both cheated on their wives. I guess I sounded judgmental, because he told me it was human nature, and even if a part of me knew he was correct, I still said that human nature wasn’t necessarily a legitimate excuse.
In December, I ushered the Christmas show at Sanders and someone told me I looked like that girl from the detective show, God I really did, if only she could remember the name, and had anyone ever told me that before? I shook my head even if though knew she was talking about Lucy Liu in "Elementary," and I don’t look like her. It didn’t matter, because maybe in the blue light of the theater I wasn’t smiling or frowning and you’d never see my un-Lucy Liu-like dimples. I should have been angry but I wasn’t. When I walked out of TD bank someone called me sexxxxy and I laughed because at that moment, life seemed too easy.
Once I told a friend that kissing someone feels like a surrender, and he told me sometimes kissing is just kissing.
When I read "Absalom, Absalom!", I underlined every time Faulkner used the word “fornicate” and thought it meant something. I wondered if he’d do the same.
At some point while I was hanging out with Syd, someone came up to her with a dollar and told her to buy an Arizona Green Tea, raspberry-flavored, from CVS. He couldn’t go in because he’d shoplifted there and got banned from the store. We spent five minutes looking for the $1 can version. On our walk away from CVS we passed by a couple of Harvard kids, and when she asked for a spare slice of pizza or a beer, they looked through us like we were straight air. I’d never been the object people were afraid to look at before. Somehow, it felt freeing. I didn’t know taking yourself from the world’s gaze would feel like that. I wondered if this was how boys feel.
After that, I went back into the bubble and felt a little more safe. No, I hadn’t felt unsafe. I just felt fresh.

The Harvard Black Men’s Forum celebrated black women making waves nationally and at Harvard during the 22nd annual Celebration of Black Women Friday.
Baltimore City’s State Attorney Marilyn Mosby was named ‘Woman of the Year,’ while star of ABC’s award-winning comedy series “Black-ish” Yara Shahidi received the ‘Trailblazer Award’ for her outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry.
Six female Harvard undergraduates and one high school senior from the greater Boston area were also recognized for their leadership, mentorship, and service.
“Our annual gala strives to recognize, honor, and thank all black women for their contributions,” BMF vice president and Celebration of Black Women board chair Cyrus M. Motanya ’17 said.
According to Motanya, the event's board wanted to recognize an individual who was “breaking barriers” in the political realm when selecting the Woman of the Year. As the youngest chief prosecutor of a major American city, Mosby was “pretty much a perfect choice,” Motanya said, emphasizing Mosby’s commitment to justice and equality.
In her keynote address, Mosby stressed the importance of challenging ingrained stereotypes and providing support to other women.
“Despite dealing with the daily stresses of our jobs, our families, our fate[s], we as warrior women have to overcome so many more obstacles and stereotypes, and all too often self-imposed barriers in the exhibition of leadership, which is why supporting one another is so essential to each of our own individual success,” she said.
Undergraduate award recipient Cary A. Williams ’16 echoed Mosby’s call for support.
“Surround yourselves with the people who make you the best version of who you are: blockmates, other close friends, the people who believe in you and remind you of your purpose,” Williams said.
Among the Harvard students recognized for their contributions to the arts on campus were Angelica Chima ’19, who created the Nigerian dance troupe Omo Naija, and Kimiko Matsuda-Lawrence ’16, who wrote and directed the original play, "I, Too, Am Harvard." Matsuda-Lawrence also co-founded the magazine "Renegade" in 2015.
Following the event, some attendees reflected on the role men can play in the broader empowerment and celebration of women.
“I think there’s an obligation for men to support women, and support them in any way they can,” said Tola O. Omilana ’16.
In a spoken word piece delivered during the program, Ryan F. Boyland ’17 summarized Celebration of Black Women’s goal of honoring black women while seeking to understand the challenges they face.
“People on this campus, in this country, on this earth don’t have to face the daily struggles that the black woman does,” he said. “I’m still learning how to best support black women, but I’m trying to get better at it everyday.”

Flint, Mich. mayor Karen W. Weaver reflected on the city’s unfolding water crisis and emphasized the importance of utilizing existing channels of government to respond to local issues at the Institute of Politics’ John F. Kennedy Jr. forum Friday.
In recent months, Flint has received national attention for its contaminated water supply, which has been linked to cases of lead poisoning and Legionnaires’ disease in local residents. One month after taking over as mayor in November 2015, Weaver declared a state of emergency in Flint.
Weaver was particularly critical of Darnell Earley, Flint’s former emergency manager who Michigan Governor Richard “Rick” D. Snyder appointed. In Michigan, the governor can appoint emergency managers to take over local governmental roles during municipal financial emergencies. Snyder appointed Earley to the position in 2014, and under his leadership, the city switched its water supply. After the switch, Flint’s residents experienced lead poisoning.
Weaver was critical of Earley’s governance in Flint., saying she believed that people in her city "didn't have a voice." 
“We used to sell water. That was one of our biggest sources of revenue,” she said. “Something that brought in revenue for the city was taken away.... Those were some of things that happened under the emergency manager.”
Weaver emphasized the importance of listening to Flint constituents and acting through existing systems of government, saying she believed Earley had given neither of these factors proper consideration.
"I think it’s so important to listen to what the voters have said and start doing that,” Weaver said. “I think we do need to honor the forms of government that are in place.”
Weaver also said “there is a solution, we just need the finances” to address the crisis, although she did not specify what a solution would entail.
Quinn T. Mulholland ’18 said he was impressed with Weaver and her approach to handling Flint’s crisis.
“I thought it was interesting how she’s using the national media as a tool for accomplishing things,” he said. “I was a little bit surprised that she is so hesitant to put blame on Governor Snyder. Her explanation made sense, but I was surprised.”
Curtis C. Valentine, a Kennedy School alumnus who attended the event, said he sympathized with Weaver and worried that situations similar to the one in Flint are more widespread than people think.
Friday’s event kicked off the Kennedy School’s Black Policy Conference, which hosts talks about issues in the black community and seeks to inspire individuals to engage in public service.

Sanofi Genzyme, a Cambridge-based biotechnology company known for its research and development of drugs to treat rare genetic diseases, donated its corporate archives to the Harvard Business School’s Baker Library.
Genzyme’s donation is the Baker Library’s first foray into biotechnology, “part of an initiative to really try and document biotechnology in New England, ” according to Laura A. Linard, the library's director of special collections. Linard said the library's archives currently lack materials from modern companies.
The company's donation will largely be made up of papers and acquisition information mostly documenting the time before Sanofi—a French drug company—merged with Genzyme in 2011, and focus specifically on its focus on rare diseases. According to Linard, some materials containing patient cases may be off limits due to confidentiality, but the library will explore accessibility options as it moves forward.
Genzyme, now called Sanofi-Genzyme following the merger, has been in its Cambridge location for more than 30 years. What initially began as a local startup with a dozen employees has since developed into a global corporation with thousands of employees, according to Julie M. Higgins,  Genzyme corporate communications manager.
“The goal is to have a collection that demonstrates how we came to be, and how we were a pioneer in innovative drugs, and how we evolved from a startup to where we are now,” Higgins said.
According to Higgins, the partnership with the Business School has been in the works for years.
“We have changed a lot, and the evolution of that is interesting, and we want to ensure that the legacy of Genzyme is never lost,” Higgins said of the company’s decision to donate materials. “Because now we are Sanofi, which is great, but we don’t want to lose who we are.”
She added that the company’s “being so rooted” in Cambridge makes it a fortuitous partnership and noted that the company has a manufacturing facility next to the Business School’s campus.
The collections will not be available until all of the materials are gathered—a process Linard said could be lengthy. However, once ready, the archives will be accessible to students and faculty across Harvard for research. At the Business School, one way this research could manifest itself is through the development of new case studies.

This week, travel to and from the Radcliffe Quad may not take so long.
Shuttles will arrive at the Quad every five to 10 minutes this week as part of a new pilot daytime route that seeks to shorten travel time.
The new route, which passes exclusively between the Quad and the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Garden Street, will allow shuttles to travel from the Quad to Harvard Yard and back in 10 minutes. The existing daytime Quad shuttle—the Quad Express—makes an additional stop at Memorial Hall, which brings the total route time to 20 minutes.
“This particular route isn’t going to cost more, money-wise, but it’s something that shuttle drivers have to adjust to,” Pforzheimer House resident William B. Keith ’16, who organized the new Quad-Harvard Yard Pilot route initiative, said.
Keith said he pushed for the creation of the route after using a similar one while working on campus last summer.
Last August, Keith released a survey to poll student support for such a route. Within a week, more than 300 students answered the poll, with more than 96 percent of respondents voting in favor of a shorter route.
According to Keith, there are typically two weekday shuttles operating on the Quad Express route, and three during peak hours. This week, one of the Quad Express shuttles will switch to using the new pilot route.
During last week’s Undergraduate Council general meeting, Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18 said members of the UC’s Student Life Committee and Student Relations Committee would publicize the new shuttle times for the week.
After the one-week pilot, Keith said he will organize a survey to gather student opinions on the route. UC representatives have also encouraged students to provide thoughts about the route through Feedback Hotline, a text messaging-based feedback system launched earlier this year.
UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said response from students will determine  the future of the route.
“After we get enough feedback, whether positive or negative, we’ll know whether or not to continue,” Greenlaw said.
Keith said the route, if successful, could become a permanent operation starting in the fall.
“Ideally, we would have, by the end of the week, a great route that we could maybe implement next year that students would be happier with,” Keith said. “At the very least, we hope to have a little more information about what works with regards to shuttle service and what doesn’t work.”

Dozens gathered for a“hackathon” at the Harvard Innovation Lab on Sunday to develop ideas to help combat campus sexual assault.
The event, called “The Exchange: Reimagining Romantic Relationships,” was launched by Confi—a student startup from the iLab that focuses on women’s health—in collaboration with the Harvard Business School and Harvard College. Harvard's Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response publicized the event on its website.
The Undergraduate Council  provided funding for the event, whose organizers had applied for a grant under the UC’s “Open Harvard” initiative, according to president Shaiba Rather ’17. She  attended the event along with UC vice president Daniel V. Banks ’17.
Montita Sowapark ’18, an event coordinator and intern at Confi, said organizers hoped attendees would “bring forward their own individual ideas and experiences, discuss gaps in the system, and ultimately determine how to better deal with campus sexual assault.”
She added that students should have a place to voice their ideas, opinions, and own experiences regarding sex and sexual assault and that they should have resources to see their ideas implemented.
Reflecting on their own personal experiences and ideas, randomly sorted teams worked together to determine how to combat campus sexual assault. Gathered around tables and white boards, each group used a provided list of general sexual assault facts and broad questions to start their conversations.
The winning team will receive a prize of $1,000 and will see their solution implemented by the UC.
Tess D. Brooks, a student at the Business School and the founder of Confi, said many of her peers had ideas on how to combat sexual assault, which has been an ongoing topic of conversation across Harvard.
“We wanted a forum for these ideas to come to fruition. We are surrounded by so many different, bright people across all of the schools and we thought that we should apply the innovation we use in our business projects to social issues,” Brooks said.
Gwen D. van de Pas, a friend of Brooks's who is currently working on a documentary on sexual assault, highlighted the importance of open forums to discuss issues surrounding sexual assault.
“One thing I come across a lot in my research is that people are not able to talk about sexual assault. We need to have an open discussion where people know they will not be judged for their opinion,” van de Pas said.

Lawyers opposing Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz in a pair of defamation suits admitted fault in accusing him of having sex with an underage woman, formally putting to rest allegations levied against the former professor since December 2014.
The settlement is the culmination of a year-long saga that began in December 2014, when attorneys Paul G. Cassell and Bradley J. Edwards filed sexual misconduct charges against Dershowitz as part of a civil case in a Florida circuit court. Cassell and Edwards alleged that Dershowitz had sexual relations with their client—who was originally referred to as “Jane Doe No. 3”—when she was a minor. 
Dershowitz publicly denied the allegations and filed a motion to intervene in the case, as well as a separate lawsuit against the two lawyers for defamation. Cassell and Edwards filed their defamation suit in response, arguing that comments Dershowitz made in media appearances harmfully called into question their ability to practice law.
Last April, a Florida federal judge struck the allegations of sexual misconduct against Dershowitz from the record of the original civil suit. Dershowitz also turned over all of his records to former FBI chief Louis J. Freeh, who launched an investigation with several former agents and concluded that Dershowitz could not have been at the locations where the civil suit alleges he had sex with “Jane Doe No. 3.”
In a statement last week discussing the findings of his investigation, Freeh wrote, “The totality of the evidence found during the investigation refutes the allegations made against Professor Dershowitz.”
Civil court mediator Jeffrey E. Streitfeld negotiated a settlement for the defamation suits and released a statement outlining its terms on April 8. Edwards and Cassell agreed to drop all allegations against Dershowitz, acceding that it was “a mistake” to accuse Dershowitz of misconduct in the first place, according to the statement. Dershowitz dropped his accusations that the lawyers had behaved unethically.
“I feel completely gratified by the result,” Dershowitz said in an interview. “They have acknowledged that they made a mistake and they have withdrawn all the charges.”
Dershowitz said he has challenged the complainant to come forward and admit the allegations were false, but said she is unlikely to do so since she could be arrested for perjury—a felony offense. It remains unclear whether Cassell and Edwards will face consequences, but Dershowitz said his involvement in the matter has ended.
“As far as I’m concerned, this matter is over. It’s resolved. The last 15 months have been torture for me and my family,” he said.
Dershowitz said he thinks his experience highlights a need for a “fair process” in cases of  sexual assault that balances the rights of the plaintiffs and the accused.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid ongoing dialogue on campus about social exclusivity, the Phillips Brooks House Association hosted an “(in)Formal” party at the Student Organization Center at Hilles  Friday evening in an effort to provide an inclusive student social space.
“As formal season occurs, and as there are so many exclusive events on campus, the idea was just to create something where the tickets are free, and you can just enjoy yourself regardless of socioeconomic status,” said Farris M. Peale ’18, one of the event’s coordinators and vice president of PBHA, the College’s student-run umbrella public service organization.
Peale noted that addressing inclusivity is particularly important because it aligns with many of the PBHA’s goals in approaching work and activism.
“I know for me personally, PBHA is a home on campus, and a place where I feel very comfortable expressing parts of my identity that might not be things that Harvard would traditionally affirm throughout its history,” Peale said. “So I think it is a type of space that is inclusive, and I think we’re trying to broaden its inclusive reach to more places on campus.”
Earlier this year, a collaboration of Harvard College women groups hosted “[BLANK] Party,” a social event with a similar goal of fostering a more inclusive social scene. The Undergraduate Council, likewise, pushed a referendum asking students whether Pusey Library should be transformed into a freshman-oriented social space. And Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has intensified administrative scrutiny over what he has called exclusivity at the College’s final clubs.
“I think there is a real need for social spaces where people are included,” Peale said. “And I think social life should be something that inherently isn’t hierarchical—that you should be able to meet as many different people as possible—that should be inclusive.”
“[Our goal] is to ensure that people have the resources, as well as the knowledge and manpower to throw really fun, inclusive events,” Stern said.
The UC’s student initiatives committee, whose purpose is to “support students who want to try new events, create new and inclusive social spaces, and expand what people at Harvard understand to be social events,” granted PBHA $500 to host the party, student initiatives committee chair Madeleine H. Stern ’18 said.
The turnout was “pretty good,” Leszek R. Krol ’18, secretary of PBHA and another organizer, said of the event. Though attendance was light early on in the night, “it started to pick up later.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First-generation students and students from under-resourced high schools entering Harvard’s freshman class could see the emergence of stronger support networks—including a possible pre-orientation program—in the coming years. 
Savannah N. Fritz ’17, who received a $3,000 grant from the Undergraduate Council last spring, has been working with administrators and a team of students to explore ways in which Harvard could be more welcoming to students from a variety of backgrounds.
“The goal is to help those students transition more smoothly to the University,” Fritz said, referring to students for whom “Harvard wasn’t a rite of passage or an expectation, but was more of a leap of faith or something they didn’t think they’d be able to do.”
To that end, Fritz and her team hope to create a summer program to help students from these backgrounds transition to life at Harvard. While Fritz said she would hope to model such a program on those of peer schools like Cornell and Princeton, which run for more than six weeks, she said she recognizes that a shorter program is more likely to gain administrators' approval.
“There’s a lot of value in the longer programs that other universities have, but it’s going to be difficult with funding and with Harvard Summer School occupying buildings,” Fritz said. “It’s up in the air what the administration will be able to support.”
Fritz has discussed the project with administrators in the Freshman Dean’s Office, including Katherine W. Steele, Director of College Initiative and Student Development at the FDO. In particular, she has proposed the creation of a pre-orientation program for the week before Opening Days, the College’s official welcome and orientation program.
While Steele said that the FDO had not yet committed to creating such a program, she said administrators were considering the proposal and other ways to support incoming freshmen.
“We might be involved if there’s ever going to be one,” Steele said about a pre-orientation program for first-generation and other students. “We’re talking about what would be the outcomes of creating a new pre-orientation program that might help students who are having a difficult transition, and who would benefit from some kind of new program.”
Short of a new program, which Fritz said she hoped could begin in the fall of 2017, Fritz and her team are working to create mentorship programs and workshops for incoming freshmen this fall.  Upperclassmen who have experienced similar circumstances would lead those programs.
Harvard already offers a meeting for first-generation students at the beginning of their freshman year, but UC Education Committee chair Scott Ely ’18 said those students could benefit from more support.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleven new students have been selected to serve on the College’s Honor Council next year, at a time when the adjudicating body has deliberately decreased its public presence.
The Honor Council—the College’s first student-faculty disciplinary board that hears cheating cases—debuted last semester with pomp, matching t-shirts, and a Facebook campaign. Last spring’s inaugural application process had its own poster marketing campaign. However, this time, selection of new members has taken on a much quieter tone.
According to Brett Flehinger, Honor Council Secretary and Associate Dean for Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, the shift is meant to ensure that individual members obtain the necessary training prior to seeking public attention, especially in the board’s nascent stages. 
The newest student appointees to the Honor Council have already begun training as they prepare to join the current undergraduates who will remain on the Council. Flehinger said the Council has spent large part of the current year focusing on a “brand new process” and that once the Honor Council begins to function with greater ease, it will shift focus back to publicity.
“It's taken a lot of energy, a lot of focus, and we’ve been very conservative in wanting to make sure that that’s where we put the bulk of our attention,” Flehinger said. “In the future, as that becomes something that is second nature, we can start to reach out and connect with the community, and start involving the community and engaging on a more public level.”
Nathaniel R.F. Bernstein ’17, a veteran Honor Council member, wrote in an email that the body also hopes to build an institutional memory between the current and upcoming academic years.
Following the massive 2012 Government 1310 cheating scandal, administrators have emphasized campus-wide discussions about the importance of academic integrity. The Honor Council and its attached set of policies— the honor code—emerged on campus with vitality.
In addition to their matching attire and Facebook page, Honor Council members have taken a public role in advertising the Council’s work in the hopes of spurring a “culture change." They also attended orientation events, course lectures, and dining halls last semester to speak with students about academic honesty and integrity.
Though the Council has not widely broadcasted its membership transition,  new members remain enthusiastic and optimistic about what their tenure on the Honor Council will hold.
“I feel very fortunate and honored, and I’m very excited to see what we will do,” Angela Yi ’19, one of the Council’s new Student Academic Integrity Fellows—who serve as liaisons to students navigating the Honor Council process—said.
Bernstein echoed Yi’s optimism and said he is “really enjoying getting to know the new Honor Council members.”
New members will officially join the Honor Council at the start of the 2016-2017 academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 11, 2016, at 8:09 p.m.
After a contentious debate, the Undergraduate Council sent a letter Sunday calling on Harvard University Information Technology to extend the deadline for undergraduates to sign up for HarvardKey, the University’s new authentication system that affiliates can use to log in to Harvard’s online services.
The previous authentication system for undergraduates, whereby students log in to online services using a Harvard University ID number and a PIN, is set to expire in June, according to HUIT. Afterward, only HarvardKey users can log in to some services, including Microsoft Office 365, according to HUIT’s website. Undergraduates who do not claim their HarvardKey in time will still have access to Harvard email and my.harvard services.
At the meeting, UC members debated legislation that said the deadline for undergraduates to claim their HarvardKey was April 20. Sponsors of the legislation worried that undergraduates would miss the initial deadline for claiming the new login service. The UC ultimately passed legislation calling on HUIT to extend the deadline.
After the UC’s meeting, the Education Committee sent a letter to HUIT detailing the Council’s stance. The following day, HUIT chief technology officer Jason Snyder responded to members of the UC clarifying that the deadline for undergraduates to claim their HarvardKey is June 1, and that the April 20 deadline only applies to "[f]aculty, staff, and other non-student members of the College." 
In their letter the UC had expressed concern that an April 20 deadline would add an extra burden to students in the midst of exams.
“Considering that students have experienced difficulty in the past creating and using their Harvar[d]Key and that the current deadline to create a HarvardKey occurs when students will be completing midterms and preparing for finals, we ask that the deadline be moved to some point in the summer,” the letter states.
Before approving the legislation, the UC held a prolonged debate with many representatives arguing that the body should first speak to HUIT before passing any legislation on the matter.
“It's unprofessional for us as a Council to send a really combative statement to a Harvard office without doing the legwork of reaching out to them to hear their side of the story,” Rules Committee Chair Daniel R. Levine ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, said. “I'm against taking a stance on something when we don't have all of the facts.”
UC President Shaiba Rather ’17, who ultimately voted against the legislation, said that helping HUIT publicize the upcoming deadline would be valuable, but that having a firm deadline was important.
“I do think that there’s a deadline in place for a reason. Deadlines are usually important in getting people to actually sign up for things,” Rather said. “The more we push back things, the less people will actually sign up.”
Still, several representatives—including UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, who voted for the legislation—agreed that many undergraduates were unaware of what they thought was an upcoming April HarvardKey deadline.
“I didn’t even know about the April 20 deadline,” Ivy Yard representative Scott Xiao ’19 said. “Now that it’s come up, I’m not even sure that I’m on HarvardKey… The potential danger of students being locked out of their information… is much more severe than the potential security risks of having one or two more months of the old system.”
In the letter to HUIT, the UC offered to assist with the publicization of the HarvardKey regardless of whether or not the deadline is extended.
The legislation passed with 20 representatives voting in favor of it and 16 opposing it. Three representatives abstained.
During the Council’s Sunday meeting, the UC also voted to allocate $3,575 in grants under the Grant for an Open Harvard College, and $10,749 in regular grants.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: April 11, 2016 
A previous version of this article, citing UC legislation, indicated that the deadline for undergraduates to register their HarvardKey was April 20. In fact, the deadline is June 1. The article has been updated to include an email from HUIT chief technology officer Jason Snyder to the UC clarifying this date. A previous version of the article also included a quote from Cabot House representative Christopher B. Cruz ’17 criticizing HUIT for the April deadline. This quote has since been removed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an election that usually consists of schmoozing Harvard alumni, Ron K. Unz ’83 took a different tack Sunday, arriving on campus for an event billed as the first-ever “debate” for a spot on Harvard's second highest governing body.
In a two-and-a-half hour back-and-forth, Unz, Daniel J. Solomon ’16, and Luran J. He ’18 discussed whether or not Harvard should abolish undergraduate tuition and make public more data about Harvard’s admissions policies—the two tenets of Unz’s “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” Board of Overseers campaign.
But much like his campaign for Overseers, Unz’s debate debut was unconventional and almost did not happen.
Initially publicized as a debate between Unz and alumni opposition group Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, the event was rebranded after the Coalition elected not to participate. The Harvard Republican Club and two Law School organizations sponsored the debate, taking the mantle after several other clubs, including the Harvard College Democrats and the Chinese Students Association, declined.
Nevertheless, Unz took a red-eye flight to Cambridge this weekend to argue for the controversial campaign platform that he and four other alumni formulated earlier this year.
For the first hour of the debate, the panel discussed the “Free Harvard” portion of the candidates’ platform. Brandishing a stick and flanked by his campaign’s signature collection of charts and graphs, Unz argued that eliminating undergraduate tuition—if not necessarily room and board—would “start a huge tidal wave” of pressure to make college free across the country.
“If Goldman Sachs bought a community college and declared itself tax exempt, that would be absurd, and that’s not too different from what’s happening at Harvard,” Unz said in his opening remarks. “Huge hedge funds should not charge tuition.”
But such a proposal, Solomon—an inactive editorial writer—contended, would be more a subsidy for the wealthy than a benefit for lower-income families. Unz replied that the typical child of two New York City public school teachers would not receive financial aid, a claim that Solomon—himself the son of “two public servants in Queens”—contested.
In the second half of the debate, Unz, Solomon, and He discussed the “Fair Harvard” prong of the platform. Unz and his fellow candidates have said they suspect Harvard may have a “quota” for Asian applicants and have called for more information to interrogate that possibility. Solomon said he was open to the idea of more transparency in the admissions process, but worried about of the consequences of such a change.
“I think transparency could be a positive thing. I don’t like the idea of multi-billion dollar organizations concealing as much information from the public as they can,” Solomon said. “I do think it’s a sort of Trojan horse for going after racial affirmative action as such.”
While Unz and his group have no explicit position on affirmative action—several of the candidates purport to support a version of the admissions program—Unz said he does not support race-based affirmative action in college admissions.
Unz, who is also running as a Republican for U.S. Senate in California, said he would consider a semi-random method for admitting students to Harvard, adding that his platform has no official position on how to change admissions policies.
“If we want true diversity, fair diversity, we should go with the random model, rather than the corrupt pseudo-diversity that we have right now at Ivies like Harvard,” Unz said.
According to University President Drew G. Faust, the debate—albeit technically one-sided—was a first in Overseers election history. While Faust said she would not endorse any candidates in the race, she has previously critiqued both tenets of the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” platform.
Earlier Sunday, the Republican Club held a private brunch with Unz.
Overseers ballots for the five open seats were sent to all Harvard alumni earlier this month, and results will be announced on May 26.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to build on last weekend’s third place finish at the Rebel Intercollegiate, the Harvard women’s golf team took its talents to the River Landing Classic in Wallace, N.C.  After playing 54 holes over a two-day stretch, the Crimson earned itself another third place finish as play wrapped up Sunday.
Heading into the final round, the Crimson found itself at the top of the leaderboard, five strokes ahead of Penn State. However, a furious comeback by No. 30 East Carolina saw the Pirates put together the only below par round by any team in the tournament at -1. By the end of the day, the Pirates had catapulted to a four-shot win over the Nittany Lions and took home the championship trophy.
Harvard got out of the gate strong, grabbing the lead by shooting a round one 291 in Saturday’s first half of play. The back end of the day was not as kind to the Crimson, however, as it was only able to muster a 25-over par 313. Sunday’s +13 301 left Harvard at +41 as a squad, seven shots behind East Carolina and three off Penn State’s pace.
On the individual end, Crimson junior Anne Cheng walked away in second place at two over par. She finished just one stroke behind William & Mary’s Alessandra Liu, the 80th ranked player in the nation.
“I think the first day especially we played very well and that put us in a good position,” Cheng said. “By round three, some of the other teams were playing exceptionally well. We’re pretty confident and we see what we need to work and focus on in practice going into Ivies in two weeks.”
Competing as an individual, sophomore Lita Guo fired a +7 223, good enough to tie for fifth with Lisa Pettersson and No. 7 F. Gustafsson Spang, both of East Carolina. Just behind her was freshman Anna Zhou, who placed eighth overall at eight over par.
Also finishing in the top 20 were senior Christine Lin and freshman Michelle Xie, both ending as part of a tie for 18th. Xie also competed as an individual for Harvard.
Rounding out the scoring team for the Crimson were senior Courtney Hooton and junior Nina Fairbairn.
“It’s really a nice problem to have deciding who will be on the scoring team on a week-by-week basis,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We feel like all our players could travel every week and help serve our team every week.”
Lin and Cheng were tied for the top spot at the conclusion of the first round. After 36 holes of play, Cheng held a two stroke lead over Liu before the William & Mary senior erased the deficit with a round three 71.
The invite was co-hosted by the University of North Carolina Wilmington and East Carolina. The 6,082-yard River Landing Country Club played at a par 72 for the weekend.
“The first day especially, both rounds were played in very high wind on fast and undulating greens that are different from what we practiced on over the last week,” Rhoads said. “I think that helps explain why some of the scores were relatively high overall.”
Also representing the Ancient Eight on the weekend were Penn, Columbia, and Yale. The Quakers took fifth in the field of 13. The Lions and Bulldogs walked away at seventh and 12th, respectively.
Also making appearances at the tournament were Old Dominion, Delaware, Rutgers, Richmond, and the University of Alabama Birmingham.
Next on the calendar for the Crimson is the Ivy League Championship in two weeks. Harvard will be looking for its fifth consecutive trip to NCAA Regionals.
“I think we’re heading in very prepared, our progressions are coming along where they need to be,” Rhoads said. “I’m very satisfied with this week’s performance. Obviously the women would have liked to hold onto first, but they played really well against some quality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby team has played in four tournaments this sevens season and for the fourth time, it made it to the semifinals. This time, however, the team went 3-1 en route to the championship game of the Atlanta 7s tournament played at Kennesaw State University this weekend. The Crimson competed against Life University’s A team, Ohio State, Texas A&M, and Lindenwood in pool play before competing against Life in the championship game of the two-day tournament.
The Atlanta 7s tournament is an international tournament, held as the United States’ stop on the Women's 7s World Cup series. The United States’ women’s national team competed at the tournament along with 11 of the other top national teams in the world. Harvard competed in the Elite College bracket of the tournament, taking second behind Life. The Crimson entered the tournament as the three seed in the Elite College bracket.
“It was great,” freshman Caitlin Weigel said. “In the afternoon, we went and we watched the international tournament, which was so exciting to see these people we watch [online]. We actually got to meet some of them which was really cool.”
Harvard 5, Life A 17
After downing the opening try, Harvard was shut out by Life for the rest of the championship match. Senior Aniebiet Abasi downed the Crimson’s lone try of the match, after sophomore Haley Langan fed Abasi for a 60-yard sprint.
However, the Running Eagles were able to down three straight tries while blanking Harvard for the remainder of the match. This was the Crimson’s second loss to Life at the tournament.
“We showed a lot of heart in all the games we played,” Weigel said, “and we were able to put in a different game plan and adjust how we played every game which shows a very high level of maturity from the team.”
Harvard 41, Texas A&M 0
Harvard opened up pool play strong, shutting out the Aggies. Abasi opened up scoring early in the first half as the Crimson took a four-try advantage into the intermission. Harvard continued to work the field as sophomore co-captain Isa Delaura downed her first try of the sevens season in the second half.
Harvard 5, Life A 33
In Friday’s final game, the Crimson was not able to contain Life’s attack, losing the first of two games against the Running Eagles. Life’s Deshel Ferguson downed the first try of the match to put the Running Eagles up 7-0. Weigel put the Crimson within two soon after, but Ferguson followed with two more tries. Life went into halftime up 14-5.
“When you’re competing against powerhouses in your sport...you give it everything you’ve got,” Abasi said.
Harvard 20, Ohio State 0
Out of Harvard’s 12 wins this sevens season, seven have been shut outs. After blanking Texas A&M in the Friday’s opening match, Saturday began on a similar note as the Crimson shut out Ohio State, 20-0. The Buckeyes gave up a pair of tries in each half to Harvard.
Harvard 20, Lindenwood 14
Lindenwood was the top seed in pool play, but the Crimson was able to upset the Lions in its final pool play game. While Lindenwood opened up scoring in the match, Abasi was able to even the score at seven. However, the Lions took a 14-7 lead into half.
Lindenwood was unable to stem Harvard’s second half attack, though. Weigel continued her dominant play in sevens as she downed the second half’s opening try, tying the game at 14-14. In the closing minutes, sophomore Haley Langan and junior Claire Collins set up Weigel for the go-ahead score as the Crimson upset the Lions to move to the Elite College championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this time last week, the Harvard men’s volleyball team was recuperating after two victories over Charleston and luxuriating in whatever sense of peace came with a two-match winning streak.
But any warm feelings evaporated this weekend during a trip to Pennsylvania. By losing to St. Francis and Penn State, the Crimson (11-10, 7-5 EIVA) plummeted into a two-way tie for fourth, putting the team at risk of missing conference playoffs.
“It was a tough weekend, but we knew it was going to be tough,” senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman said. “I don’t think we’re too discouraged by the [losses] because we know we can compete.”
ST. FRANCIS 3, HARVARD 2
Nearly two hours into a Saturday match against the Red Flash (17-8, 8-4), Harvard coach Brian Baise called a timeout.
The Crimson now trailed 9-5 in the fifth frame of a match that would determine second place in the EIVA, and Baise sought to calm his team before the result was signed, sealed, and sent off.
In the short term, the tactic worked: Harvard won the next three points to get within one.
But a kill by outside hitter Stephen Braswell contained the swell and prevented the lead change. From there, the two sides exchanged points until 14-13, when another Braswell finish handed the contest to St. Francis.
“Losing five-setters is always the most painful because you were so close to winning,” captain Branden Clemens said. “It ended up being a difference of two points.”
The Crimson forced a fifth set largely thanks to a monster eight kills by Clemens in the fourth, which the visitors took, 25-23.
On the night, Clemens topped his side with 16 kills. Meanwhile junior outside hitter Casey White posted a double-double with 12 finishes and 12 digs.
However, the more impressive statistics belonged to the Red Flash, which never trailed in the second and third sets. In both cases, St. Francis hit higher than .500 and won the second frame by eight points and the third frame by 12.
Mike Marshman was a major cause of this imbalance. The Red Flash senior tallied 15 finishes and added nine block assists, more than a third of his team’s total.
“He’s a fantastic player,” Clemens said. “We weren’t able to adequately stop him, which really hurt because when they passed well, they were able to run him and usually get a point.”
A back-and-forth first set portended the drama that followed. Facing a 19-17 deficit, Harvard turned on the jets with White serving and created enough separation to win, 25-22.
PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 0
Penn State has lost only one conference match since February of 2014. At home on Friday night, the No. 11 Nittany Lions (17-8, 10-1) were in no mood to lose another.
Limiting the Crimson to a .152 kill percentage, Penn State swept the visitors and maintained an iron grip on first place.
“We have all the confidence in the world that we can compete with them,” Schlossman said. “The first set, we had our chances late. We just have to do better in close points.”
The contest only took a lopsided turn midway through the second game, when the Nittany Lions used a 6-0 service run to turn a 17-16 deficit into a five-point lead.
Penn State claimed that frame, 25-18, and carried the momentum into the third. The hosts won seven of the first eight points and fended off a Harvard comeback to close play with a 25-17 win.
On an individual level, only sophomore middle blocker Riley Moore posted above-average numbers for the Crimson. He tied Clemens and sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch with six finishes but recorded a .625 kill percentage.
In the first frame, Harvard kept the score close all the way through 23-23. That’s when Nittany Lion Chris Nugent recorded two kills to claim the set and doom the Crimson to a week of uncertainty heading into the final slate of regular season games.
“We fought really hard and put in a lot of effort,” Clemens said. “[But] next weekend definitely became a lot more important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final tune-up before the Ivy League Championship in two weeks, the Harvard men’s golf team made the trek to Princeton, N.J., to take part in the Princeton Invitational. After two rounds of play Saturday and Sunday, the Crimson emerged from the pack of 15 schools with a second-place finish.
Playing one round on both Saturday and Sunday, the Crimson ended day one locked in a tie for third place with Yale. In round two, Harvard put together a four-over 288 to leapfrog Columbia and secure sole possession of the runner-up slot.
The No. 20 Duke Blue Devils led from the get-go, firing round scores of 274 and 269, the latter of which was good for 15-under par. Duke concluded play 34 strokes ahead of its nearest competition. Finishing one shot behind Harvard was a trio of schools—Yale, No. 42 Georgia Tech, and host Princeton.
The Bulldogs were a model of consistency, shooting five-over 289’s in each of the two  rounds.
“It’s always been important for us to strike a balance in terms of the schools we go up against,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It’s nice to play against Ivy schools because that’s our best gauge to see where we are. But we know if we had more opportunities to play outdoors we could be closer to the level of the more competitive teams.”
Penn, Cornell, and Brown also took part in the invite, making Dartmouth the only Ancient Eight program absent. The Quakers took home 10th place overall, while the Big Red and Bears placed 13th and 14th, respectively. Also finishing in the top 10 were Rutgers, Georgetown, and Seton Hall.
The tournament took place at the Springdale Golf Club. The course, which measures at 6,380 yards, played at par-71 for the weekend. The course features three par-fives holes and four par-threes to go along with its 11 par-four holes.
The Crimson as a team recorded the most hole scores of even par, registering 124, two more than Seton Hall.
On the individual side, the Blue Devils occupied each of the top three positions on the leaderboard. Alex Smalley won the individual crown at eight-under. The freshman was followed closely by teammates Jake Shuman and No. 98 Max Greyserman, both at seven-under. Duke’s No. 37 Adam Wood ended tied for ninth at even par.
Harvard captain Rohan Ramnath finished in fifth place at three below par, sandwiched between Li Wang of Yale and Marc Hedrick of Princeton. Ramnath carded the second lowest score on par-threes behind T.J. Summers of St. Joseph’s.
“We’re quite prepared and moving along our progression basically the way that I want us to,” Rhoads said. “We have a little bit of work to do on greens, trying to get on fast greens that are breaking and convert our putts a little bit more.”
Junior Robert Deng walked away tied for 16th at plus-two. Freshman Aurian Capart and sophomore Greg Royston were part of a tie for 32nd, ending play six-over-par.
Royston shot four-under on par-five holes, the third-best tally of any player. He trailed only Temple’s Trey Wren and Georgia Tech’s Vince Whaley in that category.
Rounding out the squad for Harvard was junior Kendrick Vinar, one shot behind Capart and Royston.
“It’s important we were able to have a strong finish in our last tournament before Ivy Championship,” Ramnath said. “We’re definitely feeling a lot of confidence with our game…we just feel good about what we’re doing.”
Next up on the schedule for the Crimson is a trip to Metedeconk National Golf Club in Jackson, N.J. two weeks from now for Ivy League Championships.
“We’ve gotten better every single year since I’ve been here,” Ramnath said. “Everyone continues to work hard. We’ve always been a talented team, but I think this group has a really good mindset.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the men’s and women’s crew teams were back in action this weekend, taking on some of the top teams in the nation. Facing below-average temperatures and windy conditions, the Harvard teams were able to walk away with various victories as they look to build momentum for the home stretches of their seasons.
Men’s Heavyweights
The No. 6 heavyweight team traveled to Providence, R.I. for the Stein Cup. The team edged out No. 5 Brown to take home the championship for the sixth straight year.
All of the races, except for the fifth varsity four race, were won by three seconds or less. In the V8 race, the Crimson, which finished at 5:35.8, edged out the Bears by just two seats. The second varsity eight boat also won, edging out Brown by three seconds.
The Crimson only lost two races, the third varsity and fifth varsity four races, dropping the former by 0.9 seconds. With the overall win, Harvard extends its series lead over Brown to 43-9.
Men’s Lightweights
The No. 5 men’s lightweight team had a full weekend, facing Cornell, Penn, and Georgetown in its season opener.
A week after its heavyweight teammates made the trip, the lightweight team traveled to Ithaca, N.Y., for its races against No. 2 Cornell and No. 6 Penn. The race had an early start, for impending weather conditions on Saturday forced the race to take place Friday evening.
Penn, after having the best finish in a decade in its races last weekend, and Cornell, the two-time national champions which hadn’t lost a race in two years, were ready to chip away at the Crimson’s all-time series lead against the two teams.
Harvard maintained its series lead with a split—a win against Penn and a loss against Cornell. The first and second varsity races were close, and came down to the very end of the course. In the V8 race, Harvard was half a boat behind Cornell, and just one second ahead of Penn. The Big Red, which has won the last two races against its Ivy rivals, finished at 5:51.2, the Crimson at 5:54.3, and the Quakers at 5:55.6.
The second varsity also fell to Cornell by three seconds, though it won against Penn by a wider margin. The third, fourth, and fifth varsity races were not as close as the first two, but all ended with the Crimson capturing second place.
“We’re just keep tinkering, trying to find those extra seconds, and just keep our nose to the grindstone and try to make a good run until we see Cornell again at the Eastern Sprints,” co-captain Sam Frum said.
The team returned to the Charles for its Sunday race against Georgetown. It was a bittersweet race for the seniors, who were rowing in their last home race this weekend. Inspired by its senior leaders, the team pushed through a strong headwind and low temperatures to sweep the Hoyas. In all five races, Harvard won in open water.
“We’ve got a lot of experience in our first varsity boat and a lot of youth below that so I think it was really good for the freshmen to really get their first taste of dual racing in the Ivy League,” Frum said. “It’s fierce, it’s competitive, and it’s a whole lot of fun.”
At the end of the race, the team honored its seniors, who gave words of advice to the rest of the team, and held a naming ceremony for a new boat that they had just received.
Women’s Heavyweights
Also on Cayuga Lake was the No. 17 Radcliffe heavyweight team, which was there for some Ivy League action against host Cornell and No. 9 Princeton. Like the men’s lightweight team, Radcliffe’s races were also moved up a day due to weather.
This weekend, the Black and White, which had split in its last race on the Charles this season, was up against a Big Red crew that had just picked up four wins in adverse weather, and a Tigers team that had split against the top team in the country and Columbia.
The Princeton varsity eight boat took the Class of 1979 cup for the eighth time in nine years, extending its lead in the all-time series to 26-12-1. The Tigers crossed the finish line at 6:23.5, and Radcliffe trailed by nine seconds to finish at 6:32.6. Cornell rounded out the race seven seconds later at 6:39.3.
The second and third varsity eight boats also placed second in their respective races, with times of 6:52.3 and 7:05.7, respectively.
The varsity four races had the same results as the varsity eight, with second place finishes across the board. The A and B boats finished nine and eight seconds behind first-place Princeton, while the C boat fell to Cornell by open water.
Women’s Lightweights
The No. 2 lightweight team competed against No. 1 Stanford, No. 3 BU, No. 4 Wisconsin, No. 6 Tulsa, No. 7 MIT, and Georgetown for its second straight Knecht Cup title at Mercer Lake, N.J. over the weekend.
“This was our first two-day, multiple race regatta of the year,” junior co-captain Ruby Emberling said. “Preparing mentally for those is so different. You have to make sure you're fueled and ready to go all out more than once.”
Both A and B lightweight eight boats finished in the top three of their respective heats to send them to the Grand Final. In the final race, the boats finished fourth and fifth, with times of 6:47.20 and 6:53.94 respectively. The Black and White was bested by the A boats from top-ranked Stanford, which won with a time of 6:35.96, BU, and Wisconsin.
Radcliffe’s lightweight four boat also made it to the final race, after finishing with a second-place time of 8:23.34 in the qualifying race. In the final, it finished fifth out of six boats, with a time of 7:53.46. Stanford, Villanova, Princeton A, and MIT A bested the Black and White in this highly competitive race.
“This was also our first chance to see a lot of the faster competition in the lightweight rowing world,” Emberling said. “We held our own and I'm excited to see how we continue to stack up to other teams in coming weekends.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Fowle weekend was in order for the Harvard sailing team as it finished off the team-racing portion of the season.
Although the Crimson was able to sport top-ten finishes in each of its two team racing events, the squad’s bid to qualify for APS College Sailing Team Race National Championship proved unfruitful as the four potential spots were claimed by Brown, Boston College, Dartmouth, and Yale.
FOWLE TROPHY (NEW ENGLAND TEAM RACE CHAMPIONSHIP)
Salling in FJs on the Thames River in New London, Conn., Harvard attempted to claim a bid for Team Racing Nationals in May with a top-four finish at the New England Team Race Championship hosted by the Coast Guard Academy.
The Crimson contingent of seniors, Andrew Mollerus, Sydney Karnovsky, and Marek Zaleski, juniors, Julia Lord and co-captain Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj, and sophomore co-captain Nick Sertl was unable accomplish the feat. The group’s 5-6 record on the weekend was only good enough for eighth out of the twelve schools vying for the championship berth.
“The goal of the season coming into the regatta was to qualify for nationals and we didn’t do that, so overall it was definitely a disappointment,” Sertl said.
The conditions were relatively tame, as a weak southerly breeze pervaded throughout the weekend.  As a result, not all of the desired racing was able to get done during the championship.
“[The weather] was generally pretty erratic,” Sertl said. “Because the wind was lacking for a lot of the time, there was only time to do the one round robin of all twelve teams, which meant that a couple of silly losses meant a lot and made it so that we didn’t break into the top four.”
Rival Yale proved victorious with its only loss on the weekend coming to Dartmouth.  Boston College, Brown, and Dartmouth rounded out the top four qualifying places.  Although tied with Connecticut College, URI, and Coast Guard in overall record, Harvard was only able to best the event hosts in their individual matchups.
EMILY WICK
Competing against 17 other inter-conference schools in an all women’s multi-divisional regatta hosted by Connecticut College, the Crimson sailed to a 13th place result.  Led by sophomore skipper Taylor Ladd and sophomore crew Kirstin Anderson in the A-Division, the group finished with 175 total points over the sixteen combined races between the two divisions.
“We sailed pretty well in some tough and inconsistent conditions,” Ladd said. “They were two difficult days of sailing, but we learned a lot over the course of the weekend.”
Ladd and Anderson finished ninth amongst their divisional crews with a final score of 75. Their results in races varied widely throughout the weekend, placing as high as third and as low as sixteenth in any individual event.
After starting strong with a second place finish in their second race of the day, fellow rookies, skipper Taylor Gavula and crew Lena Episalla did not place higher than tenth in any of the other B-Division contests. The duo tallied 100 points over the weekend to finish in seventeenth in the division.
Brown took home the gold with its own 83-point performance after placing first in the A-Division and second in the B-Division to Stanford.
MYSTIC LAKE TEAM RACE
On the Mystic Lakes in a nearby Boston suburb, a group of six freshmen —skippers Nicholas Karnovsky, Andrew Puopolo, and Jackson Wagner, and crew Alejandra Resndiz, Christion Gosioco, and Robert Anderson—competed in Larks in an entirely in-conference team race regatta.
Highly variable, shifty winds were the norm throughout the weekend with highs in the mid-teens and lows at one knot.  In the conditions, the rookies mustered an eighth place finish out of the 11 schools in contention with a 3-7 overall record.  The group was unable to best any of the schools above them on the leaderboard, but finished undefeated against those below.
Fellow Ivy League competitors, Brown and Dartmouth finished in second and third place, respectively.  Tufts, the hosts of the event, was able to claim victory with an 11-1 overall record after beating Brown, 2-0, in the best of three sail-off between the two schools after it closed regulation with identical.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Last season, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team dropped every single one of its conference road games. The squad sported a respectable 2-1 record at home, but with its costly struggles away, it finished 2-4 and second-to-last overall in the Ivy.
This past Saturday, the Crimson had its first chance to redeem itself when it traveled to Ithaca, N.Y., to face off against Cornell. After grabbing an early lead and maintaining a slight advantage throughout the first half, however, Harvard suddenly found itself trailing 7-6 in the third quarter. The Big Red had just scored three times in less than a minute, seizing the momentum and fueling the excitement of a crowd of over 1000 spectators.
With the contest hanging in the balance, the Crimson quickly found the back of the net to tie the score and then went on the offensive. Outscoring Cornell by a margin of 6-1 over the last 21:16 of the match, Harvard made sure it secured its first conference road win in almost two years.
The Crimson (6-5, 2-1 Ivy) has now earned three straight victories against the Big Red (4-5, 1-3), after winning 10-9 in a close game at Harvard Stadium last season and 14-9 in Ithaca the year before. In the 2016 Ivy standings, the Crimson also holds the advantage, sitting in sole possession of third place after Saturday’s results. Cornell, meanwhile, fell to fifth place with the loss.
“It’s always good to win an Ivy game, especially on the road,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “The guys also wanted to win this one for [new Assistant Head] Coach DeLuca, who used the be the head coach at Cornell.”
DeLuca, who mainly coaches the Crimson defense, had his men ready for the start of the match, as the unit only allowed three goals in the first half, all unassisted. The Big Red found it much more difficult to score than it did last week, when it slotted away 13 into the Dartmouth net in the same time period.
Harvard sophomore goalie Robert Shaw was the main reason for Cornell’s struggles, as he made nine saves in the first 30 minutes of play.
“Fortunately, I was able to see a lot of their shots as they came in,” Shaw said. “Credit really goes to the defense for forcing some low angle shots and helping me get in a rhythm early on.”
Because the Crimson started slowly on offense as well, however, it only held a 2-1 lead at the end of the first quarter and 4-3 advantage at halftime. Harvard senior attackmen Will Walker and Devin Dwyer paced the team on the this end of the field in the first two frames, with Walker tallying two goals and Dwyer picking up two assists.
The game opened up in the third quarter, with the two teams trading goals as each went on a big run. The Big Red pushed forward first, netting three straight goals to take a 7-6 lead. The Crimson answered with four straight of its own, however, seizing back control of the game.
“Our guys have been in that situation before and didn’t panic,” Wojcik said. “It was great to see them have a short memory when it came to the plays that didn’t go our way, and then in the fourth quarter, I thought our conditioning benefited us a lot.”
Cornell went on one final attack and drew to within two goals late in game, but Shaw stepped up to the challenge, stopping eight shots in the fourth period.
Sophomore attackman Morgan Cheek and senior midfielder Ian Ardrey then put the game away for Harvard with two late goals as they took advantage of a Big Red defense that was forced to push up the field.
“At the end, we rushed them into taking some bad shots,” Shaw said. “Then the offense stepped up and put it away. It was good to go into the last few minutes with the lead, not having to catch up like some other times this season, and finish it off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Ready to pick up where it left off after defeating Dartmouth, 17-9, last weekend, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (7-3, 3-1 Ivy) secured its second Ivy League victory in a row with an 8-2 win over Brown (4-6, 0-4) on Saturday at Harvard Stadium.
The Crimson defense played a pivotal role in the victory. Holding the Bears scoreless for all but five minutes of the game, Harvard’s formidable defenders only allowed Brown to find the net twice during the game. The defensive effort was led by a strong showing from co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis, who recorded seven stops. The senior turned away four free position shots on the way to the win.
It has been 22 years since the Crimson kept an Ancient Eight opponent to only two goals. Harvard last achieved the feat when it defeated the University of Pennsylvania 7-2 in March of 1994. Next weekend, the Crimson will play the No. 16 Quakers in its first Ivy League contest away from Harvard Stadium in over a month.
Despite playing on Harvard’s home turf, the Bears controlled the pace of the game in the first half. In the opening period of the game, Brown recorded four draw control wins while the Crimson had zero.
“Coming into the game, we expected Brown might try to slow down the pace of play, and that’s exactly what they did,” co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd said.
However, Harvard’s potent offense eventually made its mark, when Todd scored the only early goal of the game at 25:35 off a feed from sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn, who sprinted through the Brown defense all the way from the 50-yard line to set up the goal from behind the cage. Over 25 minutes later, Glynn scored the game’s second goal with five seconds remaining in the half, giving Harvard a 2-0 lead going into halftime.
Brown had opportunities to score in the first half but failed to capitalize on them, going zero for four in free position shots. The Bears also outshot the Crimson, 19-18, on a day that saw them lead statistically despite coming away with the loss. Brown finished with a 9-3 advantage in draw controls, as well, with freshman midfielder Alex O’Donnell winning four.
“We played very well defensively and caused many, many turnovers,” Todd said.  “Early on, we were just struggling to find the back of the net on the attacking side of the ball – hence the low score.”
The Crimson found its offensive stride in the second half, and senior midfielder Alexis Nicolia paced Harvard with her second hat trick of the season. Nicolia helped settle the Crimson attack with back-to-back goals at 15:21 and 11:40.
“We kept plugging away, and once we were able to string together a couple of goals in the second half, we found our groove,” Todd said.
After being held scoreless by Harvard for 55 minutes, Brown finally broke through when junior midfielder Jillian Lee scored her her 11th goal of the season and the Bears’ first goal of the game at 5:43. The Crimson answered with four shots, another from Todd, two from junior attacker Maeve McMahon, and a final effort from Nicolia.
“Offensively, everyone chipped in to our success,” Todd said. “It was not so much one or two standout performances as it was a collective team effort.”
Securing the win against Brown was crucial for the Crimson’s push to secure a spot at the Ivy League tournament. With only the top four teams in the league qualifying, this weekend’s result buys Harvard some breathing room. The Crimson is now sitting in third place in the Ancient Eight standings, with No. 20 Cornell and No. 11 Princeton in first and second, respectively.
"I think yesterday was a really great win for the team,” junior defender Emma Ford said. “Every Ivy game is really important and takes us one step closer to the league tournament"

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team (16-13, 6-2 Ivy) swept both Penn (13-16, 2-6) and Columbia (7-24, 2-6) this weekend at Soldiers Field as the squad solidified its second-place spot in the Ivy League.
“This weekend was really crucial after going 2-2 [against Princeton and Cornell] in the first weekend, we really wanted to gain some ground back,” co-captain Zoe Galindo said.
The weekend victories put the Crimson in a good position as it looks toward challenging Dartmouth for the top spot.
“We’re really going to have to keep pace with Dartmouth by winning every game we can,” Galindo said. “It’s going to be a fight, but as long as we focus on ourselves and focus on winning every game we have ahead of us. . . we’ll be able to get to the [No.1] spot.”
HARVARD 10, PENN 2
In the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader, Harvard scored double-digit runs for the second straight game to close out the weekend with a four-game sweep.
Sophomore Maddy Kaplan and freshman infielder Rhianna Rich led the team with two runs, two hits, and two runs batted in each.
“Rhianna Rich, Maddy Kaplan, and Giana Panariello all came up big in big situations,” rookie center Elizabeth Shively. “Honestly, offensively everybody has been hitting really well. I couldn’t tell you one person that did so much better than anybody else. It was a total team effort.”
A solo home run by senior outfielder Haley Davis and three additional runs gave the Crimson a 4-0 advantage in the bottom of the third. After Penn answered with two runs in the top of the fourth inning, Harvard added six insurance runs on three doubles and a single in the bottom frame.
Junior righthander Taylor Cabe limited the Quakers to two runs in the five-inning contest, striking out 4 batters and recording her 10th win of the season.
HARVARD 11, PENN 10
The front end of the doubleheader Saturday was the biggest challenge for the Crimson this weekend, as the game extended to extra innings.
Galindo and Rich each drove in runs as they got the game rolling in the bottom of the second inning.
After Penn plated five runs in the top of the fourth, Harvard quickly responded to knot the score in its half of the inning.
In the sixth, Penn once again took a commanding lead, but freshman catcher Elizabeth Shively’s first career home run in the bottom of the seventh shifted the momentum back in the Crimson’s favor.
The game come down to the wire as it was tied in the bottom of the eighth inning after freshman infielder Meagan Lantz drove in a run to make the score 10-10.
With two outs and Lantz in a position to score, it was up to junior Bay Shore, N.Y. native Panariello to finish the game. The second baseman delivered, lacing a walk-off single to right field to win the game.
“Having Giana come in and get the game-winning hit was just really clutch,” Galindo said.
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 3
The second game in Friday’s doubleheader was another close matchup as the Lions pushed the Crimson defense all seven innings.
Columbia sophomore infielder Taylor Troutt drove in two runs with a homer over the right-center fence in the first inning to give the Lions a 2-0 advantage over Harvard.
The Crimson would not respond until the fourth inning, as sophomore outfielder Dallas Hogan, junior infielder Savannah Bradley, and Lantz all drove in runs to put Harvard up, 3-2.
Troutt would come up big again for Columbia in the top of the fifth inning with a double to bring the score to an even 3-3. However, Kaplan’s sacrifice fly to center field in the following inning allowed Rich to cross the plate and secure the victory for the Crimson.
HARVARD 8, COLUMBIA 0
In the first game of the weekend Harvard’s offense out hit the Lions, 13-3. The Crimson had two doubles and two triples in the five-inning game.
Senior right-handed pitcher Morgan Groom earned her fifth win of the season as she struck out six Columbia batters and allowed zero earned runs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the home pool of the eighth-ranked team in the nation is rarely an easy affair. For the No. 13 Harvard women’s water polo team, leaving Canham Natatorium with a win was even harder.
The Crimson (19-7, 0-3 CWPA) lost matches to No. 15 Indiana, host No. 8 Michigan, and No. 16 Princeton this weekend, falling to a winless start to CWPA conference play.
Harvard is being dominated in the all-time series against this particular trio of rivals, now trailing 15-61-1 combined. The Tigers also hold a 23-game winning streak over the Crimson.
“The team fought hard this weekend in three games that we knew would be very competitive and difficult,” junior attacker Melissa Balding said. “I think the difficulty highlighted some of the areas that we still have room to improve [upon] moving forward.”
Harvard is now 8-6 this season against ranked opponents and 3-4 against those ranked in the top 15.
No. 16 PRINCETON 9, No. 13 HARVARD 7
Balding put the Crimson on the board first with an early goal, giving Harvard its first lead of the weekend, but Princeton (14-5, 1-2 CWPA) responded by taking a 4-3 lead after the first period, holding on to win, 9-7.
Junior attacker Michelle Martinelli tallied three goals in the loss, while senior captain Yoshi Andersen added another. Sophomore goalkeeper Cleo Harrington made nine stops between the pipes.
We definitely learned a lot about ourselves as a team, and learned how to respond to momentum shifts that were against our favor,” Andersen said. “Part of [our loss] was being a little bit too timid, and being afraid to make mistakes, and then getting frantic and actually making those mistakes.”
Four different Princeton players, including leading goal-scorer sophomore Haley Wan, tallied two goals apiece to lead a balanced Tigers attack. Princeton led 7-4 at the halftime break and maintained a three-goal cushion until 1:23 left in the game, which was more than enough for the Tigers to come away with their first CWPA win and leave Harvard winless on the weekend.
No. 8 MICHIGAN 10, No. 13 HARVARD 5
Saturday afternoon’s nationally-televised game against the Wolverines (22-6, 3-0 CWPA) proved to be a one-sided affair, as the home team jumped out to 4-1 lead over the Crimson halfway through the second period and never looked back. Michigan stretched its lead to five goals and preserved the margin to defeat Harvard, 10-5.
Five Harvard players tallied one goal each to provide the total offense. However, part of the Wolverine’s success was realized in holding freshman attacker Kristen Hong, the Crimson’s leading scorer, without goal.
On the other hand, the leading Michigan scorer, senior attacker Ali Thomason, burned Harvard’s defense with four goals and short-circuited its offense with three steals.
“These games are difficult because [Princeton, Michigan, and Indiana] are teams that know how to capitalize on mistakes,” Balding said. “Sometimes, you can get away with making a mistake in the game, but against teams like these, making errors will cost you goals.”
Harvard pulled within two scores, 5-7, with five minutes remaining in the fourth period, but ill-timed exclusions and turnovers halted any momentum that it had gained.
“Moving forward, there’s things that we want to do, on both offense and defense, just to make sure that the whole team is on the same page all the time,” Balding said. “It’s just becoming more familiar with the systems that we want to run and being able to be adaptable.”
No. 15 INDIANA 10, No. 13 HARVARD 7
Indiana (17-6, 2-1 CWPA) jumped out to a 4-0 second-period lead and held off a late Harvard charge to win, 10-7, evening up the season series at 1-1 after losing to the Crimson in overtime earlier this season.
Balding’s third consecutive hat trick and Harrington’s 12 saves in goal spearheaded Harvard’s performance. Hoosier senior center Candyce Schroeder snapped the back of the net three times and redshirt freshman Karrie Kozokar scored thrice to lead Indiana.
The Crimson, playing in its first conference game of 2016, fell behind early and never led. Saturday’s loss to the Hoosiers also snapped Harvard’s three game conference-opener winning streak.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Finding confidence at home, the No. 50 Harvard men’s tennis team (13-10, 2-2) triumphantly ended the weekend with two Ivy League victories.The Crimson bested Penn 6-1 (7-13, 2-2) on Saturday and overcame No.37 Princeton (14-8, 2-2) on Sunday for a close 4-3 win.
“Everyone watching provided fantastic energy and a lot of support,” freshman Andy Zhou said. “Due to this, the team was riding the confidence waves.”
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 3
The Tigers proved to be the bigger challenge on the weekend, as Harvard barely upset Princeton 4-3 on Sunday afternoon at the Murr Center.
The Tigers entered the weekend with an undefeated record in the Ivy League, earning a pair of 4-1 wins against both Brown and Yale. Additionally, sophomore Luke Gamble entered the match at the No.5 spot having triumphed in his last 10 decisions.
The Crimson, however, came into Sunday’s matchup with a 52-45 all-time series lead over Princeton, using its 4-3 victory against the Tigers last season as a foundation for confidence.
" Although we weren't able to get the doubles point today which was too bad, we were able to bounce back with strength in singles," co-captain Nicky Hu said. "Sebastian beat a great player at No. 2 and he really clinched for us today in front of his family."
Handling the pressure with grace, Beltrame closed the match for Harvard in a 6-4 third set victory from the No. 2 spot. Beltrame began the game with a first set win of 6-3, but was faced with a challenging battle as Princeton junior Tom Colautti gained the advantage in the second set 7-6 (5). Beltrame’s tiebreaker triumph gave Crimson the edge over the Tigers after a squared score of 3-3.
Starting at a 2-1 loss in the doubles point, the Crimson fought back to win four of six singles matches to gain the upper hand.
Hu fought back from a 6-3 loss in the first set to win the last two 6-3, 6-4. Zhou and freshman Christopher Morrow also took home straight set wins, as Zhou ended Gamble’s win streak with a 6-4, 6-4 victory and Morrow defeated Princeton freshman Jimmy Wasserman, 6-3, 6-0.
"Anytime a team strings together two victories, it is a positive reinforcer," said Hu. "If the team really focuses on one match, one point at a time, we have a real chance to make NCAA."
HARVARD 6, PENN 1
Blazing past Penn 6-1 on Saturday at the Murr Tennis Center, the Crimson started the weekend strong.
Sophomore Kenny Tao seized the match that ensured a Harvard victory at second singles on Saturday against the Quakers. Fighting back after an initial 6-1 loss in the first set against senior Vim de Alwis, Tao captured the following two sets, 6-3, 6-4.
Zhou rallied back from a first-set loss as well at fourth singles, taking the next two sets in order to defeat Penn junior Matt Nardella.
“My opponent was a lefty and liked to mix up his serve so it took me awhile to figure out my own strategy against him,” Zhou said. “The key I think became my returns against his serves. I was able to catch on to what he was trying to do and I was then able to break him a few times.”
Senior Kelvin Lam and sophomore Jean Thirouin also both posted singles’ wins. Lam defeated Quakers’ sophomore Josh Pompan in the No.3 slot in a three-set match, coming back after an initially close set of 5-7. He took the final two sets with a twin score of 6-3. Thirouin secured a victory in the No.6 slot. After decidedly concluding the first set, 6-3, a narrow margin 7-6(4) broke the tie-breaker in the second, giving Thirouin the match.
Freshman Christopher Morrow added force to the momentum with a two-set singles gain.
On the road to clutching the doubles point, all three Harvard pairs established what the Crimson had come to do. Ready from the beginning to claim victory, the doubles seized a win in all three matches.
The duo of co-captain Nicky Hu and junior Brian Yeung defeated its opponent, 6-3, while junior Sebastian Beltrame and Thirouin earned a victory in a tighter 7-5 match.
Zhou and Morrow overpowered their opponents as well at second doubles, posting a 6-3 triumph to conclude the doubles sweep.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After stumbling to a double loss to Ancient Eight competitors Columbia and Cornell last weekend in its opening Ivy League weekend, the Crimson came into the match needing a boost in fortunes.
After recovering from a loss on Saturday to Penn (7-5, 2-2 Ivy League), the No. 63 Harvard women’s tennis team (11-9, 1-3) came back with a thrilling win against No. 61 Princeton, 4-3.
“We beat Princeton, who are reigning Ivy champions the past two years, earlier this season, so it was great validation to beat them once again today,” sophomore Annika Ringblom said. “It is very exciting for the whole team, especially the freshmen, to get this first Ivy win. Coming out of this win from Princeton, we have the confidence to win our remaining Ivy matches.”
Harvard 4, Princeton 3
Harvard had a short travel time from Penn to Princeton but was determined to change its fortunes. No. 61 ranked Princeton sits just two positions below the Crimson in national rankings, however, coming into the match the two teams had had vastly different outcomes in the Ivy League. Princeton was ranked 1st alongside Columbia with a 3-1 record, while Harvard was rock bottom, with a zero in the win column.
Harvard looked to put an end to its troublesome run. The Crimson came out strong in the doubles matchup, with Ringblom completing several tough shots in the final two games alongside freshman partner Sabrina Xiong to clinch the doubles point after the  junior-freshman pair June Lee, and Erica Oosterhout won.
Similar to the match against Penn, Harvard traded bullets with Princeton, but this time had the distinct advantage of the doubles point.
With the match score poised at 3-3, sophomore Nikki Kallenberg was looking uphill. She was down a set, and down 4-2 in the second set tiebreak, points away from a 0-4 Harvard start to the season. But the freshman dug in, winning the tiebreak and then the 3rd and final set, claiming a Harvard victory in the No. 2 position.
Harvard 3,  Penn 4
The contest started with the competition for the double’s point, a best of three double’s matchups in which the winning side would go up 1-0 overall before the six singles matches.
The Crimson dropped the double’s point after the Lee-Oosterhaut duo lost against Penn’s No. 2, while Kallenburg and freshman Isabel Jasper fell 6-3 to Penn’s No. 3 pair.
Singles play presented a mixed bag for both teams, both going 3-3. Penn did not mind trading points because of its distinct advantage from the doubles.
For the Crimson, the typically strong bottom half of the ladder went 1-2. The No. 5 position Xiong lost in a three setter 6-4, 2-6, 7-5, while Ringblom lost 6-3 in both sets. No. 6 ranked senior Amy He won her match in straight sets 6-3, 6-0.
With the double’s loss and the falter at the bottom of the ladder, it was up to Harvard’s best to overcome a resolute Penn. The Crimson was two-thirds of the way there after Kallenberg and Oosterhout won in straight sets. However, No. 1 position  Lee was beaten 6-4, 6-2, the Quakers handing the Crimson its third loss in three matches.
“The difference between Saturday and Sunday were literally just one or two points,” Lee said.  “Saturday, Sabrina lost 5-7 in the third set when the match was tied 3-3 but that just shows how one or two points makes the difference between winning and losing, and the Ivy League level of tennis as risen a lot. It just shows how there is not one team that is extremely dominant or extremely weak, and it basically is who is better on that given day.”

Today marks T-5 days until Eleganza, Harvard’s annual charity fashion show/display of human magnificence in dancing form. It's hard to believe that the day is so quickly approaching. It was just a few months ago that many a runway hopeful showed up to the show’s open auditions (contrary to what one might expect, it turns out that Harvard’s campus is filled with aspiring models). But everyone knows that Eleganza is extremely selective, taking only the absolute crème de la crème. In case you find yourself among those who had their modeling (read: dancing) dreams crushed by Eleganza auditions, don’t be so quick to despair--here’s Flyby’s guide on how to be an Eleganza model, so you can kill the auditions next year.
High cheekbones are an absolute must for any Eleganza model. Aim for at least a 120° angle by always looking slightly above every person's head. You want to be able to cut diamonds with your jawline.
Practice a seductive, smoldering gaze. How do you suck in your cheeks without looking constipated? Practice on your roommates. On your classmates. On your TFs! If you’re still having trouble, Tyra Banks has some good instructional videos on how to Smize made just for people like you.
Spend the summer learning how to move your body. If you think this is all about modeling, think again. Eleganza models are multitalented creatures, so if you’re just a pretty face, this isn't the place for you. Don’t be afraid to break out those dance moves--the more seductive, the better. A good benchmark for what Eleganza dancing is like is to consider how your parents would feel if they saw your performance - if the answer is "slightly uncomfortable," you’re golden.
Finally, aim for a certain "je ne sais quoi." This is probably the hardest of the criteria to master (because developing an extremely sharp cheekbone-and-jawline combo is quite easy). Unfortunately, there’s really no straightforward advice we can give here. Basically, Eleganza models are particularly cool and edgy. If you’re not, well, maybe a quick trip to Urban Outfitters will do the trick?

In less than a week, hundreds of hundreds of admitted pre-frosh from the Class of 2020 will descend on Harvard’s campus for the annual Visitas program. For current freshmen and those upperclassmen who may have forgotten the effects of the three-day program on student life, we here at Flyby have you covered on what to expect when you’re expecting (prefrosh, that is).
This coming weekend there will be long (or longer) lines and fewer seats in the dining halls, especially Annenberg. Prefrosh and their families will also pretty much take over the restaurants in Harvard Square, so if you’re planning on dining at Felipe’s, Pinocchio’s, Tasty Burger, or even Chipotle, plan on having to wait for an extended amount of time for tables and meals.
There will likely be a loud atmosphere in the libraries, especially Lamont. So if you’re planning on knocking out that statistics pset at the library, make sure you’re prepared to work amidst incessant chatter. It’s gonna be #lit.
The only thing better than getting admitted to Harvard is taking pictures of it and posting evidence of your time here all over social media. From prefrosh who will ask you to take a picture of them and their families on Widener’s steps to those overly eager to photograph your suite (with or without your permission), expect flashing cameras through the weekend. And expect to end up in the backgrounds of dozens of pictures, unknowingly, as you fight your way through the prefrosh crowds in the Yard. You've finally made it on this campus - enjoy the moment and the opportunity to get to know these un-jaded new students.
Visitas is all about meeting new people, of course, and so there will be many new Facebook requests from prefrosh whose excitement can add to your own now that your blocking group has fallen apart with next year’s rooming drama. If you look like a freshman, you could also fall victim to aggressive efforts from clubs and groups who’d like you to join them next fall. This could, however, be a beautiful opportunity for you to ~start all over~

Well, it’s that time of year again folks.  Hard as it is to believe, the 2015/16 school year is coming to a close, and while you procrastinate on those final papers, at least you’re able to get a head start on something for next semester: rooming drama.
You don’t think it will happen to you, but it will.  Whether you’re a freshman realizing that there’s that one blockmate that you absolutely could never live with, or an upperclassman who figured out too late that your blockmate has a habit of leaving hair behind in the shower drains, everyone at some point will have doubts about rooming with a friend.  It’s not that you don’t like them, you just don’t want to share a bedroom with them.
So now’s the time to plan your escape route.  Never fear, because Flyby’s got some strategies to help you break it to your blockmate that you don’t want to room with them.
Send them a card in the mailWho doesn’t like getting real, authentic snail mail in 2016?  Millennials live for this nostalgic #throwback to simpler times. So buy a cute card and write your blockmate a note explaining that you cannot stand the idea of tolerating their snoring for another second, let alone another school year.  They’ll enjoy novelty of the mode of communication so much that they’ll forget to be sad!
Use the architecturePore over your house floor plans and construct a reason why, architecturally speaking, your chances in the rooming lottery are better if you enter as a group of 3, not a group of 4.  You can’t argue with such solidly grounded logic.
Use the mathIf your house uses an averaging system – whereby the group’s number is the average of all the members’ individual lottery numbers – you can invoke the Law of Large Numbers to make your case (thanks Stat 110).  The idea is that the bigger your group, the more the average of all those random numbers will tend towards the overall mean of all the lottery numbers – so the less likely your group is to end up choosing rooms first or last.  Explain to your blockmate that you like to live on the edge, you want to take the risk of ending up last for the chance of getting the best suite in the house, and so you want as small a group as possible.  They are the weakest link, goodbye.
Be sneakyJust file your rooming preferences without consulting the person you want to leave out.  Once they’re with the housing administrator, there’s nothing you can do about it.  Nothing.
Be the mature, partially-Harvard-educated adult that you are and talk to themAs if anyone actually does this though.
Accept your fate because you are a cowardAcquiesce to their request and let them join your rooming group.  Begin filling our your transfer forms for next semester.
There you have it. Some foolproof ways to wimp your way out having tough, real world conversations by finding semi-legit excuses. May the odds be ever in your favor.
