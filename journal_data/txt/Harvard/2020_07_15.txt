After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anthropology professor Gary Urton told colleagues in the department that he plans to retire in August, two months after he was placed on leave amid allegations of sexual harassment.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay placed Urton on paid administrative leave June 3 following an investigation by The Crimson that found Urton and two other Anthropology professors face allegations of sexual harassment.
Later that week, two more former students told The Crimson that Urton had sexually harassed them, and 25 Anthropology faculty demanded Urton’s resignation.
Nearly 400 students also signed a petition demanding that Urton — along with the other two professors — be removed from their departments and have their tenure revoked before the fall semester begins.
Anthropology chair Ajantha Subramanian announced Urton’s plans to retire by the end of August in a one-sentence email to department affiliates Tuesday afternoon.
Urton and Subramanian did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
By retiring, Urton will likely retain emeritus status and its benefits — the ability to hold an office on campus, teach and advise students, and receive support from administrative or research assistants — though he will presumably remain on administrative leave.
Gay has the authority to strip him of his emeritus distinction. Until Urton officially retires, only the Harvard Corporation can strip him of his tenure — a move not seen for several decades.
After former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez retired while facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment, Gay waited for the completion of a year-long Title IX investigation through Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution before stripping Dominguez of his emeritus status and barring him from campus.
Urton currently faced at least one ODR investigation into a complaint filed by former Ph.D. student Jade d’Alpoim Guedes in early June.
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane confirmed in an emailed statement that the investigation into Urton will continue even if he retires.
“In keeping with the FAS Policy and Procedures on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment, an individual’s retirement does not end an investigation, and at the end of any investigation, the Dean (or Dean’s designee), having received the investigation report, will separately will consider the imposition of discipline,” Dane wrote.
Dane declined to answer questions about whether Urton would retain emeritus status or whether Gay would publically announce the results of investigation as she did in the Dominguez case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Police Patrol Officers Association— the union representing Cambridge Police Department officers — denounced a new police reform bill on Facebook last Wednesday, writing of a “purge that will come” if the bill is passed.
The original post, which has since been edited, defended police officers in the Commonwealth and labelled a police reform bill in the Massachusetts Senate as a “knee jerk reaction.” The proposed bill, Bill S. 2800, would create an independent police standards and accreditation committee to recertify police officers every three years and maintain a public, searchable database of complaints against officers. Lawmakers approved the bill on Tuesday morning by a vote of 30-7.
In the Facebook post, CPPOA argued against the bill’s passage by warning there would be a “purge” if Massachusetts followed the lead of other states with “problems.”
“Massachusetts police officers are the most educated in the country and we don’t have the problems some other states have,” the post read. “If you think 7 civilians killed in 7 days in Boston is bad, just wait for the purge that will come.”
Residents posted more than a hundred comments — many of which have been deleted — on social media criticizing CPPOA’s statement, including City Councilor Marc C. McGovern, who described the statement as “outrageous” on Twitter. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts also decried the statement on Twitter, describing the language used as “violent and threatening.”
“This is the kind of violent and threatening language that police are using to try and destroy the bill being debated,” the Massachusetts ACLU tweet reads. “Cops are bullying our legislators because they want the authority to continue to oppress people in the streets.”
In response, the association’s executive board edited the original post to remove the sentence implying a “purge” and issued a follow-up statement clarifying the use of the term “purge.”
“This was not a call for anyone to commit any acts of violence,” the statement read. “This has been misconstrued as such. After conferring with the original author and our Association leadership, we affirm that this statement was in reference to violence crime rates increasing in neighboring Boston and in other cities across the country as police departments have had their funding, staffing and resources cut.”
“We apologize that the two sentences in the original post have been chosen to be interpreted as violent or hateful,” the statement continued.
In a statement posted to Facebook, CPPOA wrote that a member of the union did not author the post. Melissa Hurley, a PR consultant that represents CPPOA, declined to share who wrote the post.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick declined to comment on the matter.
The Cambridge Police Department also experienced social media backlash in May when CPD Superintendent Jack Albert inadvertently tweeted on the official CPD account, calling Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) a “jerk” and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) a “clown.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security filed their response Monday to a lawsuit brought by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology arguing that though the universities disagree with new rules, they are not illegal.
A hearing on Tuesday was scheduled to determine if Judge Allison D. Burroughs would issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent immigration authorities from enforcing rules that barred international students taking online-only courses from residing in the United States.
But the hearing never happened — Burroughs instead announced that ICE would rescind the rules.
The “burden of proof” for Harvard and MIT is four-fold: first, that the suit is likely to succeed on the merits; second, that irreparable harm is likely to occur without an injunction; third, that that harm outweighs damage to the opposing party; and fourth, that the injunction is not “adverse to the public’s interest.”
ICE and DHS argue in the filing that Harvard and MIT fail all four tests.
The issue of success on the merits hinges on whether the government acted in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that requires that government agencies to behave in a manner that is not “arbitrary and capricious.”
The filing claims that the rules were issued “after considering important aspects of the problem,” including the “fluid nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need for stakeholders, including schools, to have access to guidance regarding the impact of the pandemic.”
Both of these criteria were invoked in a statement on a Frequently Asked Questions page on the ICE website since January 2020, which the agencies cited as proof that ICE “considered at least two important aspects of the situation.”
The agencies also referenced the wording of the rule change on July 6, which said the new rules aimed to “balance public health concerns against the varied approaches that schools and universities are taking to combat the spread of COVID-19” — two more “factors of critical importance” that ICE hopes to prove it considered prior to the rule.
As proof of its consideration for the needs of universities, the government argues that ICE could have forgone the pandemic-related exceptions entirely and reverted back to rules that forbid all online coursework for F-1 visa holders. The new ICE guidelines still allow international students to take some courses online, as long as some of their instruction also occurs in person.
The filing also cites the exceptional nature of the rules from March to counter the argument that universities relied on it in their planning for the fall semester.
“Any further reliance interests that schools may have had in the March 13, 2020 guidance are necessarily inconsequential, as the guidance clearly indicates that it is only temporary,” the filing reads.
ICE and DHS made a similar argument — that it could have rolled back the rules even further — to prove that its rules were “supported by a reasoned basis and justification.”
“Rather than completely rescinding the March guidance and reverting to business as usual with respect to schools and foreign students, ICE announced a measured transition to begin a move toward reopening schools and allowing students to return to classrooms,” the filing states.
Another rule in the Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to offer a period of “notice and comment” before rule changes. But the agencies argued that this type of notice falls under an exception for “general statements of policy” that are not legislative rules.
They also noted that the new rules do not mandate that ICE “take administrative compliance actions against schools” or “initiate removal proceedings against F-1” visa holders.
“DHS would most likely defer from taking such action until a regulatory change was properly made,” the filing states.
But at least two students — including a rising sophomore at Harvard College from Minsk, Belarus — have already been denied entry to the country since the rules were issued last week.
The agencies also argued the petitioners have failed to demonstrate irreparable harm.
“Petitioners do not explain how physical presence in the United States is required for one to participate in a 100% online learning experience,” the filing reads. “Nor do they explain how the lack of physical presence by their nonimmigrant students participating in the online programs would negatively impact other students, who are also participating in the online course, or the administration of their set curriculum.”
Granting a temporary restraining order would “harm the United States and the public,” according to the filing, since the public has an interest in immigration enforcement.
At the brief’s conclusion, the agencies wrote that Harvard and MIT lack standing to sue on behalf of their international students, and that Burroughs should not consider potential harms to students as justification for a temporary restraining order.
For Harvard and MIT to have standing on behalf of their international students, they must prove that they as institutions have also suffered harm; that they have a close relationship with impacted students; and that a “hindrance exists that prevents” these students from protecting their own interests.
The agencies asserted that the schools failed to establish the second or third points, and the only harms the institutions said they themselves suffer — “the desire to implement additional in person classes and an alleged loss to the diversity of their student body” — are insufficient.
Thirteen amicus briefs were filed between Friday and Monday by more than 50 colleges and universities, 26 cities and counties, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others.
There are currently eight other lawsuits filed against ICE and DHS by various stakeholders nationwide, including other universities and colleges, a group of graduate students, and a number of states.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After learning that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had changed its rules to require students completing online-only coursework to leave the United States, Student 6 grew “immediately concerned” that their young family was about to be “separated or uprooted.”
Student 6 — the moniker by which they are known in court documents to protect their anonymity — is an Australian citizen working towards their Ph.D. at Harvard.
But their daughter, who was born in March, is an American citizen. Pandemic-related delays have prevented them from securing a passport for their daughter, and they believe the process may take several more months.
“If I am forced to leave the United States, I could be separated from my infant daughter, something I cannot imagine,” Student 6 wrote. “Given the ongoing uncertainty around passport processing times, I do not know how long we would be separated.”
Departing the country could also imperil the student’s academic work, like teaching at the Harvard Extension School, conducting research, and working with faculty to establish a new laboratory.
“The impacts of this directive would be devastating for my family and my research,” they wrote.
Student 6’s story is one of eight sworn declarations from students at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, submitted to the Massachusetts District Court Monday as part of a lawsuit brought by Harvard and MIT against the Department of Homeland Security and ICE.
Though the government agreed on Tuesday to rescind the policy change, the stories of the students who submitted declarations — four of whom were from Harvard — reveal how much was at stake. They represent just a fraction of the nearly 4,000 F-1 visa holders who study at the University.
Student 1 — the only undergraduate among the group — is a rising sophomore and student-athlete at Harvard College who made headlines last week after being stopped at the airport in Minsk, Belarus, the first known instance of the new rules’ enforcement.
The declaration described the student’s experience in more detail than previously revealed. The student had an F-1 visa valid through July 29 and was about to fly from Minsk to Frankfurt, from Frankfurt to New York, and from New York to Miami, where they planned to visit their sister and then fly to Chicago to stay with a teammate for the semester.
When they attempted to check in for their flight, an airline agent told them that F-1 visa holders were not on the list of approved travelers, according to the declaration. In correspondence with the U.S. Consular Office, they were told that they needed to reroute their travel to avoid coronavirus-related travel restrictions and to confirm they were not taking online-only courses.
“You need to have a letter from your university that you will not be 100% study on-line, and you physically will be attending classes (off-line program),” the email from the U.S. Consular Office read.
The student wrote they do not believe they will be able to return to the United States, and that it will be “difficult, if not impossible” to complete their coursework from Belarus.
“Minsk is seven time zones ahead of Cambridge, so I would likely have to take classes and participate in any virtual extracurricular activities at odd hours,” Student 1 wrote. “Additionally, my varsity sport and other extracurricular activities are integral to my experience at Harvard, and I am eager to begin participating in those activities as soon as they resume.”
Student 3 is a rising second-year student at Harvard Law School from India-Administered Kashmir. They left to study abroad at age 15, when “violent civil unrest broke out” in the area.
The student was unable to communicate with their parents for nearly half of a year when the Indian government cut off the region’s access to internet and telecom services in August 2019, according to their declaration.
“If I return to my parents’ home in Kashmir, I will not have consistent access to
Internet that can support high-quality video conference calls,” Student 3 wrote. “Although the Indian government restored limited access to 2G networks in January, 2G Internet handles video streaming very poorly.”
“Considering the continuing civil unrest, the Indian government, which directly administers Kashmir as a Union territory, could easily again cut off all Internet access to the region,” they wrote.
Student 3 added that there is a nine-and-a-half-hour time zone difference between Cambridge and Kashmir. Their ability to maintain a schedule synchronized with the Law School would be further complicated by the Indian government’s continued lockdown order, they wrote.
Student 4, meanwhile, is a second-year M.D.-Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School from Ethiopia, currently living in Cambridge and conducting cancer research.
They wrote they are concerned for their safety due to “significant civil unrest” in Ethiopia, and that if they are forced to return there, they will have to defer their second year at the Medical School due to unreliable internet access and a seven-hour time difference.
“The Ethiopian government has recently shut down the Internet in response to the civil unrest,” they wrote. “Even if the government were to allow access to the internet, the Internet connection would be unreliable, making it difficult if not impossible, to participate in my online courses.”
In a declaration on Monday, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote that more than 1,000 of Harvard’s F-1 visa holders — around one quarter — are from countries with blocked or restricted internet, such as Ethiopia, China, and Syria.
The other four students who submitted declarations attend MIT, which has about 3,500 students on F-1 visas.
Student 2 is an engineering graduate student at MIT originally from Lebanon, who is currently researching in collaboration with the school and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
“Lebanon is currently experiencing an extreme economic crisis and famine,” Student 2 wrote. “I would not be able to access the basic tools to complete my work online, including electricity and reliable internet.”
“NASA is counting on our work, and it would be very disruptive if I could not continue this fall,” they added.
Their declaration also described personal hardships, including food insecurities and safety concerns.
Student 5 is a graduate student at MIT from a mountainous region in Brazil. Though they only have one class standing between them and their Ph.D., they wrote that they had planned to conduct research this semester that requires regular faculty meetings.
“The internet connection is not strong enough to hold long video conferences, making it difficult to collaborate with faculty members and others,” Student 5 wrote. “It will also be difficult, if not impossible, to access certain research materials.”
They also noted they will experience “large financial loss” — up to $14,100 — if they are unable to remain in the United States, having already signed a lease.
Financial and public health concerns will also indefinitely separate them from their partner.
Student 7 is a doctoral student from Hungary studying at MIT. They wrote that they will be unable to return to their parents’ residence due to “traumatic experiences” they experienced as a child. Their brothers are also unable to support them financially if they were to live with them.
“I am a lesbian, and the culture and political environment in Hungary is very homophobic,” Student 7 wrote. “For example, the government has recently sought to repeal measures protecting LGBTQ rights, and police often fail to investigate hate crimes committed against LGBTQ people. Returning there would thus require me to suppress core aspects of my identity to preserve my safety.”
The student also wrote that they are currently an active outpatient, following a hospitalization for their mental health, and they only have health insurance in the United States.
“Leaving the country would deprive me of access to critical medical care that I require,” they wrote.
They wrote that they would lose their support system if they leave the country.
“I depend on a social support system in the United States consisting of my partner, friends, and others,” Student 7 wrote. “Although social support is important to everyone, it is especially critical for me, given my recent mental health issues.”
Student 8 is a graduate student at MIT from South Africa who cited electricity shutdowns, poor internet connection, and the six-hour time difference as significant challenges. They also would be unable to work as a resident assistant in graduate student housing.
“In addition to the aforementioned hardships, having to be in South Africa, rather than on-campus at MIT, is endangering my physical and psychological wellbeing,” they wrote. “Just this past week, seven armed men invaded my home and robbed my family and I at gunpoint.”
“My family and I could have been killed. Since the robbery, I have experienced severe panic and anxiety,” Student 8 added. “I am desperate to return to the United States so that I can continue my studies without fear of such an armed assault on my home.”
The motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt the immediate enforcement of the new rules will be argued at 3 p.m. on Tuesday in front of Federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 14, 2020, at 6:30 p.m.
The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have agreed to rescind a policy that would bar international students taking online-only courses from residing in the United States, District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs announced at a hearing on Tuesday.
ICE will revert to the guidance it issued in March that allows students taking online courses to reside in the United States on F-1 visas, and it will rescind any implementation of the policy.
Burroughs said the parties had agreed to a resolution less than five minutes into a hearing for the case Harvard and MIT filed last week asking the courts to bar DHS and ICE from enforcing the policy. The universities drew support from hundreds of peer institutions, dozens of cities and states, and student organizations.
Since the agencies announced the policy, it created significant issues for international students. In a hearing last week, Harvard’s lawyers cited the case of an incoming Harvard sophomore stopped at the airport in Minsk, Belarus due to the new guidelines. Other students also filed declarations in the case attesting to the challenges the policy would have posed.
In an email to affiliates on Tuesday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that he was “delighted” by the withdrawal of the policy.
“This is a significant victory. The directive had disrupted all of American higher education,” Bacow wrote. “I have heard from countless international students who said that the July 6 directive had put them at serious risk. These students – our students —  can now rest easier and focus on their education, which is all they ever wanted to do.”
Bacow acknowledged that the government could issue a new directive of the same nature — a possibility that reporters attributed to senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday.
“While the government may attempt to issue a new directive, our legal arguments remain strong and the Court has retained jurisdiction, which would allow us to seek judicial relief immediately to protect our international students should the government again act unlawfully,” Bacow wrote.
He wrote that in light of the ruling, he expects the school year to “proceed as we have carefully planned.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Economics Ph.D. student Martin Aragoneses, the first three days after finding out about a new policy from Immigration and Customs Enforcement that would have required him to leave the country in the fall were “tough.”
“I literally had the same feeling in your stomach you have when somebody dies,” he said. “You feel lost. You feel unwanted. You feel so much uncertainty about your future, about the country that’s given you so many opportunities, and where you’ve learned as a human being, and an economist, and as a person — now someone is trying to kick you out of it.”
But after his initial grief and shock, Aragoneses decided to use what he has learned as an Economics student to address the issue.
He started by calculating the financial impact of the policy on him, weighing a number of considerations: he had just signed a two-year lease and furnished his apartment.
Then, using the framework from his own personal calculations, Aragoneses developed a survey to distribute to other international students, which he launched on Sunday. Within 36 hours, more than 1,000 international students had responded.
Aragoneses and a team of other students worked from 8 p.m. Monday to 8 a.m. Tuesday — a feat they compared to completing late-night problem sets in their first year of graduate school — to crunch the numbers and come up with preliminary results.
They found the policy would have cost the average international student more than $20,000, a sum that Aragoneses, who is from Spain, said was similar to the amount he calculated for himself. Some students could face significantly more, though — up to $40,000 in costs.
Under the policy — which the government agreed to rescind on Tuesday — international students would have been required to transfer to a college or university offering in-person courses or leave the country. If they do not, they risk facing “immigration consequences” including “removal proceedings.”
The preliminary survey results comprise 1,040 students, approximately one-third of whom are undergraduates, one-third of whom are masters students, and one-third of whom are doctoral students. They represent institutions including ​Harvard, Princeton, Yale, MIT, University of Chicago, and the University of California system, among others.
Of those surveyed, a vast majority of the students are currently located in the U.S. And like Aragoneses, a majority of them are locked into a lease agreement, the single largest source of potential financial strain they reported.
Around 40 percent of students also reported not having internet access in their home countries, according to preliminary estimates.
The survey also found that if implemented, policy could have reduced the likelihood that students would remain in the United States to pursue further education, perform research, and work at a company or startup by up to 50 percent.
Both Aragoneses and Robert Minton, another Economics graduate student who worked on the project, counted those findings among the team’s most significant.
“One is pursuing further advanced studies in the U.S., and we find that reduces the likelihood of that event for 83.3 percent of respondents,” Minton said, citing early estimates of preliminary data. “For working for a U.S. company in the future, it lowers the likelihood for 83.4 percent of respondents.”
“This policy will first put a tax on them economically, but then also put a tax on them emotionally, and raise future uncertainty about staying,” Aragoneses added.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce — along with companies like Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Boston Consulting Group, and Paypal — made a similar argument about the “critical” nature of international students in the workforce in an amicus brief filed Monday.
Ultimately, Aragoneses said he believes the magnitude of the policy extended far beyond its financial impact.
“It's not just about finances and good numbers, it's about people that feel a huge strain and are in for a very, very tough time,” he said. “ I think that's very very real, and I feel that in my own bones.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School students joined peers from law schools across the state in a letter urging the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to replace the 2020 bar exam with an automatic admission option — a request the court subsequently denied.
The students’ July 10 letter asked the court to consider an “emergency diploma privilege plus” strategy, which would license law school graduates without requiring the bar examination. Currently, the court plans to administer a delayed online exam on October 5 and 6 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The letter received over 650 signatures from students and members of the legal community, including Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins and the deans of all accredited law schools in Massachusetts except Harvard. Two retired Associate Justices of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court also signed the letter in support.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 previously wrote to the court alongside eight other law school deans in a series of letters dating from April 15 to July 8. Those letters requested the adoption of a temporary practice authority that would allow graduates to begin working in the legal field despite testing delays.
The court also rebuffed that proposal, citing concerns about allowing graduates to practice law only for them to fail the exam in the future.
“Not only would this raise justifiable concerns about their competence to practice law when they were doing so, but it also would create the problem of nascent law practices having suddenly to close shop, potentially leaving clients in the lurch,” Chief Justice Ralph D. Gants wrote in a July 13 response.
The authors of the July 10 letter instead advocate for permanent bar admission.
“Some employers might be willing to hire law school graduates understanding that they need to take time off from work a year or two down the road, but lots of other employers probably don't have the flexibility to make that sort of accommodation,” Samuel B. Feigenbaum, a recent Law School graduate who helped write the letter, said in an interview.
The recent letter also includes the results of a survey of more than 190 law school graduates. It claims the COVID-19 pandemic has created obstacles preventing 2020 examinees from adequately preparing for the upcoming bar exam.
“As a result of these and additional hardships, 75% of respondents report financial insecurity, 29% report housing insecurity, and 79% report that they are currently struggling with their emotional and mental health,” the letter reads.
The survey also includes data on remote testing conditions, finding that less than 46 percent of respondents have reliable Internet access, less than 31 percent have access to a quiet testing space, and more than 75 percent feel that they have been unable to prepare for the exam due to the pandemic.
“It is a basic premise of standardized testing that a test is fair and equitable only if all examinees prepare for the test under similar circumstances and take the test under similar conditions,” the letter reads. “The data from the impact survey confirms what has been clear from the start---it is impossible to achieve this during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Recent Law School graduate Hannah N. Perls — another author of the letter — claimed the current system would also advantage “students of privilege” due to the online exam’s monitoring.
“One thing they said about the online exam is that we will be monitored using machine learning or AI software where interruptions and abrupt noises and distractions could trigger a red flag,” she said. “And so, the students who pass this online exam will probably have access to the quietest spaces and the most reliable internet.”
Perls also raised concerns about the court’s announcement that the new online exam will be non-transferable, meaning examinees cannot use their scores outside the state except in Maryland, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia, which have reached individual agreements with the Board of Bar Examiners.
The letter also discussed a 2017 study on bar exam pass rates in New York, which uses the same Uniform Bar Exam typically offered in Massachusetts. The study found that a white test-taker is 39 percent more likely to pass the bar exam than a Latinx exam-taker and 64 percent more likely to pass than a Black exam-taker.
“Coronavirus, in our expectation, will simply make those disparities worse because coronavirus also has racial and socio-economic disparate outcomes,” Feigenbaum said. “Black and brown folks are far more likely to know folks who've gotten seriously ill or died from coronavirus.”
Perls said the differences in pass rates across ethnicities reflects the origin of the bar exam, which she said aimed to reduce the number of Black legal practitioners.
“When we fight to uphold the institution of the bar exam, we are fighting to uphold an exam that has traditionally been used to exclude Black lawyers and also Hispanic and Latinx lawyers,” she said.
“We have an opportunity to address the long-standing disparities in the legal profession, and the compounding disparities that COVID-19 presents, and the only solution at this point is emergency diploma privilege,” Perls added.
Marilyn J. Wellington — the executive director of the Board of Bar Examiners — responded to the letter in a July 14 email to the authors, rejecting the proposed strategy.
“We will explore longer-term solutions to respond to the concerns you have shared. Diploma privilege, however, is not a solution that will be provided at this time,” the email reads.
Wellington wrote that the Justices recognize the challenges faced by examinees and thanked the signatories for sharing their perspectives — in reference to the 93 testimonials included in the July 10 letter on behalf of 2020 Massachusetts Bar applicants.
The testimonials shared obstacles brought on by the pandemic that currently prevent examinees from preparing for the bar exam, such as losing loved ones, caring for young and sick children, and working as essential employees to pay off student loans.
“The delay of the 2020 MA bar exam has, in short, broken me,” one testimonial reads. “It has cast me into a world of uncertainty and also a sudden realization that I now [won’t] be able to afford things as basic as rent until October.”
