After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under the Friday night lights, students and fans filed into Harvard Stadium en masse for Harvard’s first home game since a 24-20 loss to Penn on November 16, 2019. Together, the sea of crimson and white formed a raucous crowd of 20,748, firing up the Crimson as it played its opening game of the 2021 Ivy League season. The crowd came to see a show, and Harvard (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) certainly produced one, running all over Brown (0-2, 0-1 Ivy) in a 49-17 victory. The Crimson raced out to a 42-0 halftime lead and cruised the rest of the way as it claimed its 22nd win in 27 Ivy League openers under Coach Tim Murphy.
In its victory over Georgetown on Sept. 18, the Crimson leaned on its talented trio of tailbacks — junior Aaron Shampklin, sophomore Aidan Borguet, and sophomore Sone Ntoh, rushing for 330 yards compared to the Hoyas’ six. Against the Bears, it was the same story. Shampklin, Borguet, and Ntoh combined for five touchdown rushes as Harvard penetrated Brown’s defense to the tune of 243 yards on the ground.
After gaining 183 yards on 14 attempts against the Hoyas, Shampklin led the way again against Brown, turning his 13 carries into 121 yards, good for an average of 9.3 yards per carry. He also found the end zone twice, pushing his early-season touchdown total to four, which currently leads the Ivy League. Shampklin had sat out the 2019 season before the 2020 season was canceled by the Covid-19 pandemic, and his hard work throughout his long layoff did not go unnoticed by his coach.
“Unbelievable football player. So selfless, [he] has a huge heart. You have no idea what an inspiration he is to our team. No idea,” Murphy said after the game.
Unlike the game against Georgetown, when Harvard’s third play from scrimmage went for a 56-yard touchdown on a run by Borguet, the Crimson got off to a slow start offensively, being forced to punt on its first possession of the game. Junior punter Jon Sot, who had been named to the All-Ivy League First Team in each of his two seasons with the Crimson, pinned the Bears, with his punt being downed on the three-yard line, putting Brown’s offense in a precarious position.
Harvard’s defense was able to capitalize almost immediately on the special teams unit’s success. After Bears running back Allan Smith clawed back a yard with a first-down carry, quarterback EJ Perry handed him the ball again a yard into the end zone. Two Crimson defensive linemen, junior Chris Smith and senior Jacob Sykes, broke through the offensive line and stuffed him in the backfield, and as he fought to make it back to the line of scrimmage, Smith hit him from the left side, forcing him to cough up the football. Senior linebacker Andrew Irwin pounced on the loose ball, securing possession for the Crimson in excellent field position.
After the turnover, it took just one play for Harvard to strike paydirt. With senior running back B.J. Watson in motion to his right, drawing Brown linebackers with him, Shampklin took a handoff, saw an opening slightly to his left, and raced uncontested into the end zone. The four-yard touchdown gave Harvard a lead that it would never relinquish.
After Shampklin’s score, the teams traded punts for the rest of the first quarter. The Bears offense gave Harvard a little bit of a scare when quarterback EJ Perry, who was honored as the All-Ivy First Team quarterback in his first season with Brown after transferring from Boston College prior to the 2019 season, completed a 23-yard pass to wide receiver Wes Rockett, advancing the ball inside Harvard territory for the first time. Sophomore defensive lineman Nate Leskovec came up clutch on third and four at Harvard’s 39-yard line, stopping Bears running back Jordan DeLucia after a one-yard gain. On the ensuing fourth down, offensive lineman Lucas Ferraro was flagged for a false start, knocking Brown back five yards and forcing a punt.
Later in the quarter, a poor punt from Sot left Brown with good starting field position, taking possession at Harvard’s 45-yard line. On second and nine, Perry completed a pass to Hayes Sutton, who ran out of bounds at the edge of field goal range at the 32. After an incomplete pass on first and ten, Perry kept it himself on second down. He managed to gain a yard before Smith forced his second fumble of the game; although Brown retained possession after offensive lineman AJ Heidtke recovered it, the Bears lost two yards and kicker Christop Maron eventually missed wide left on his 51-yard field goal attempt.
Smith’s defensive aggressiveness also set the tone for what would be a two-way show of dominance by Harvard in the second quarter, in which they would score 35 points to break the game wide open. The Crimson offense took advantage quickly after Maron’s missed field goal; junior quarterback Charlie Dean immediately found junior wide receiver Kym Wimberley Jr. for a 12-yard strike. Wimberley then hauled in a crucial reception on third and five from the Brown 49 to just squeak past the chains and claim a fresh set of downs for Harvard. Then, offensive coordinator Mickey Fein showed off his ingenuity. After taking the snap in shotgun formation, Dean faked a handoff to Shampklin and another to Watson, confusing the Bears defense and allowing Wimberley to get wide open deep. Dean found him for a 44-yard touchdown and a 14-0 lead. He would end up leading the Crimson with four receptions for 71 yards and the score.
Harvard’s defense would force a three-and-out on the ensuing Brown possession, allowing the offense to get the ball back on its own 32-yard line. After a steady diet of Shampklin runs advanced the ball to the Brown 44, Dean converted a big play, completing a 40-yard pass to sophomore tight end Haven Montefalco, who was brought down at the four-yard line. Ntoh gained two yards on first down, but that was as far as the Crimson would advance, leaving them with a fourth and goal from the two-yard line. Instead of allowing junior kicker Jonah Lipel to attempt a 19-yard field goal, Murphy opted to leave his offense on the field after it converted three out of its four fourth-down conversion attempts against Georgetown. His aggressive decision paid off; Brown linebacker Jason Medeiros missed a tackle in the backfield and Shampklin beat everyone to the left sideline, racing in untouched for the score.
On their next drive, the Bears managed to get in a rhythm with their offense, driving deep into Harvard territory. They interspersed a mixture of short plays with one 23-yard completion to wide receiver Graham Walker. On second and ten from the Harvard 33, Perry again targeted Walker, and although his pass fell incomplete, Harvard’s sophomore defensive back Khalil Dawsey was flagged for pass interference. Dawsey would get his revenge two plays later, though. Perry’s second-and-one pass attempt from Harvard’s nine-yard-line was overthrown and sailed into the waiting arms of Dawsey, who took it back 77 yards before Perry was finally able to bring him down on Brown’s 18-yard line.
Staked to a 21-0 lead with possession deep in Bears territory, the Crimson offense did not need to be aggressive. Four runs later, Harvard struck paydirt yet again, this time on a three-yard rush up the middle by Borguet. Dean contributed to his team’s cause with a nine-yard run to set up Borguet’s score. Lipel converted the extra point attempt to put Harvard up 28-0.
On the next possession, Harvard’s stifling run defense snuffed out rushes from Brown punter Declan Boyle and running back Jordan DeLucia to set up a punt. But Boyle failed to get a punt away before he was tackled deep in his own territory, handing Harvard possession of the ball at the 18-yard line. Ntoh quickly made the Bears pay, rushing twice in three plays, including an eight-yard run up the middle and into the end zone.
Harvard kept the pedal down, extending its lead once more before halftime. First-year defensive tackle Thor Griffith brought the hammer down on Perry, Harvard’s third forced fumble of the game. Senior defensive lineman Justin Mitchell scooped up the loose ball and rumbled 13 yards into the end zone for a touchdown to extend the Crimson lead to 42-0 with 1:03 remaining in the half.
After the game, Mitchell praised his teammates for stopping the Bears’ rushing attack and noted the importance of Harvard forcing three turnovers while not giving the ball away. All in all, Harvard allowed 14 yards on the ground and has yielded only 20 on the season, continuing its elite play after it was the stingiest in the Ivy League in 2019, only allowing 90.1 rushing yards per game.
“Football’s just a game of momentum. So, I was just looking at the rushing yards. [Fourteen] rushing yards we allowed. So, we just played lights out tonight, and turnovers are a part of that. And we get a turnover goal every day in practice, so we practice that, making sure we’re hitting those goals and it just showed on the field tonight,” he said.
The fact that Mitchell was able to play at all against Brown was a testament to his resilience. He fought through two major surgeries, and he would have not been eligible to play in 2021 if not for the Ivy League’s allowing seniors to return for their final season of eligibility due to the 2020 season’s cancellation. So far in the 2021 season, he has made the most of his opportunity, excelling both on the field and as a vocal leader in the locker room.
“Justin Mitchell is one of our seniors [who] elected to come back. He’s gone through two major surgeries to play a fifth year, and to see him score a touchdown today — I guarantee there was not one guy on our team that doesn’t think he’s just been an unbelievable leader. He’s set an unbelievable example. We always talk about fighting through adversity, and he’s just been a great leader in every respect, so it was pretty cool to get a touchdown. First of his life,” Murphy said with a laugh.
Brown had one final chance to get on the scoreboard in the first half, but Maron’s field goal attempt from 40 yards fell short. Harvard went into halftime with a 42-0 lead, its largest advantage at the break since September 28, 2012, when it took a 49-3 lead at home against Holy Cross en route to an eventual 52-3 victory.
The Bears eventually got on the board on their second possession of the second half, with a 35-yard field goal from Maron. However, after they subsequently failed to earn a first down on their next possession, Murphy elected to pull Dean from the game. With senior quarterback Jake Smith under center, the Crimson continued to pound the football, steadily driving deeper into Brown territory with runs by Shampklin and Ntoh. Eventually, Ntoh found the end zone from a yard out for his second touchdown of the game, extending the Harvard lead to 49-3.
With the final outcome well out of hand, Brown managed to tighten the margin in the fourth quarter. With their running backs limited by Harvard’s front seven, they turned to their senior quarterback, and Perry delivered, firing strike after strike, including a 43-yard touchdown pass to Walker. He later would find Rockett for a two-yard score as time expired to cut the final score to 49-17.
With 49 seconds left in the game, Harvard players doused Murphy in a cold bath of yellow Gatorade. The Crimson was virtually assured of victory, which marked Murphy’s 180th at the helm of the program and broke a tie with Yale’s Carm Cozza to make him the winningest coach in Ivy League history. After the game, Murphy downplayed his accomplishment, attributing his success to the players and assistant coaches he has worked with during his 27 seasons with the team.
“This is a milestone for our program. It’s a milestone for our team. But the reality is, the people who really accomplished that were every single Harvard football player who ever entered the field with me, every single assistant coach we’ve had, which is probably sixty different coaches over the last 27 years, it’s ours together. It’s not a coaching record the way I look at it. It’s a team record; it’s a program record,” he said.
Dean completed 14 of his 24 passes for 156 yards and a touchdown to lead the Crimson. In addition to Shampklin’s brilliant game, Borguet added 38 yards on his eight rushes to go with his touchdown run, and Ntoh turned his nine carries into 30 yards. Sophomore quarterback Jack Bill saw action as a receiver and caught two passes for 52 yards, coming second on the team only to Wimberley.
The defense delivered a stout performance despite Perry’s completing 34 of 45 passes for 346 yards and two touchdowns, intercepting him once and recovering two fumbles. In addition to Smith’s two forced fumbles, Dawsey’s interception, and Mitchell’s score, senior linebacker Jordan Hill, the 147th captain of Harvard football, led the team with nine total tackles. After the game, Hill maintained that while he was proud of his team’s performance, he was looking for areas for improvement.
“Guys have just been working [hard] to get there, and putting out a product like that just is a testament to all the hard work that everybody did, and it’s something that we’re definitely proud of. But, like Coach Murphy said, it’s just the second game of the season. It’s not the end of the world. It’s not everything that we hoped to be. It’s not everything that we expect to be, and we know that we just have to keep building and growing from here,” he said.
Harvard will look to continue its hot start as it travels to Worcester, Mass., to face Holy Cross (2-1, 0-0 Patriot League) on October 2 at 1:30 p.m. EST.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hannah Bebar calmly received the ball with her back to goal and took a touch before turning and firing into the top right corner to put Harvard up 3-0. By the time the ball rippled the net for the third time at Jordan Field, it had become clear that the Crimson will present a different type of challenge for Ivy League defenses this season. In their last four meetings, No.15/23 Harvard (7-0-1, 1-0-0 Ivy League) and Penn (5-2-2, 0-1-0 Ivy) had scored three combined goals. The Crimson matched that total on a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising past the Quakers to open the conference season with a resounding win.
Bebar was the star of the day. The first-year midfielder made the left wing her own, combining well with junior midfielder/forward Hannah Griffin and first-year forward/midfielder Nicola Golen and peppering shots at the Penn goal. The Naperville, Ill., native showcased her technical ability, dribbling past Penn defenders, retaining the ball well, and serving as the fulcrum of Harvard’s attack for most of the afternoon as she bookended the scoring.
“[Bebar’s] a very talented soccer player,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “She’s got the ability to beat you off the dribble, she’s got a great final pass, she can shoot, defends well. And she’s growing into her role. She has a job to do on the team; she needs to fulfill her responsibilities to the group, and she’s doing that. And because she’s doing that it’s making things better for her as well.”
As the Crimson’s set-piece taker, Bebar helped the team threaten from corner kicks and scored on a free kick from over 30 yards out, driving the ball through a crowd in the box and past the diving Penn goalie into the bottom left corner. She drove the final nail into the Quakers’ coffin with her 71st-minute strike, which showed that she could handle a striker’s duties too.
“We had a lot of composure in the final third in the second half,” Bebar said. “We really put the game away instead of letting them hang around for too long, so I think just putting it away and continuing to dominate defensively really helped us.”
Bebar’s partner down the left flank for much of the first half, Griffin, also impressed with her pace and explosiveness in what was just her second career start. The Luxembourg native, who missed her entire first-year season due to injury in 2019, has received more playing time of late and is growing into a role that made her an important part of Harvard’s success on Saturday.
“[Griffin’s] been training really really hard,” Hamblin said. “She’s not naturally a left-sided player, but we’ve been playing her on the left and we put her into the middle a little bit today, and she did really well in both positions.”
The Crimson dominated possession and had a near-monopoly of chances. The third Harvard Hannah — junior goalkeeper Hannah Gardner — had a pleasantly quiet game, as Penn managed just five shots as a team; meanwhile, Bebar alone was responsible for 10 Crimson shots, including eight on target. Harvard as a team racked up 23 shots, 14 of which were on goal, improving a season average that was already in the top-20 nationally.
Junior forward Angela Caloia joined Bebar on the scoresheet, finding space in the box and collecting a pinpoint chipped pass from captain and midfielder/forward Sophie Hirst before deftly finishing into the bottom right corner midway through the second half. Caloia’s goal was her sixth on the season, matching her total in 2019, as the U19 Italian national team striker continued to exhibit her goalscorer’s instincts.
In a few previous games, the Crimson had come out equally strong and put together dominant first-half performances before conceding space and eventually goals in the second half. But this time there was no let-up from Harvard. Penn’s best moments came in the first half and particularly in the game’s first few minutes when the Quakers managed to put some pressure on the defense. By the hour mark, the traffic was completely one way, with the Crimson posing problems for Penn’s defense while the Quakers created very little offense. Hamblin viewed the second-half performance as a sign of a maturing and improving team.
“I think the team’s learning,” Hamblin said. “We’re learning from some of the challenges we’ve had. They took that to heart and were able to execute. We said look, we haven’t been able to put a team away, we haven’t finished strong, and we’ve got to do that. So I’m really proud of how they came out in the second half.”
First-year forward Ainsley Ahmadian and senior forward Murphy Agnew did not play after suffering injuries last week against Kansas. Creative first-year midfielder Josefine Hasbo, meanwhile, sported a bandage after requiring stitches for the inadvertent cleat she took to the face in the Kansas game.
For one game at least, Harvard justified its fresh No. 6 spot in the NCAA RPI rankings. The Crimson will look to keep rolling next Saturday as it travels to New Haven to face Yale. The Bulldogs (1-8-0, 0-1-0) were soundly defeated by Princeton on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third time in its first six matches, Harvard played overtime after 90 minutes was not enough to find a winner. Unlike its other two games to go to overtime, the Crimson came out of this one victorious, sending Vermont home with a golden goal in the 107th minute from first-year forward Alessandro Arlotti.
Harvard (3-2-1, 0-0 Ivy) beat the Catamounts for the first time since 2008 on Friday night, as Arlotti continued his stellar form, grabbing an assist and a goal, his third of the season, all of which have been game-winners.
“It’s amazing. We deserved it,” Arlotti said of the goal. “We fought for 110 minutes and we scored. It was amazing.”
The Crimson opened the scoring early with its first chance of the game, after junior forward Duncan Sutherland and Arlotti combined skillfully down the left flank to drag the Vermont defense wide. Arlotti drifted inside after picking up the ball from Sunderland before playing in senior midfielder Cornelius Bencsik, who finished coolly across the face of goal to put Harvard up 1-0 in the sixth minute.
“I feel like every game we play, we just get better and better with the ball and off the ball,” Bencsik said of the game. “We’re starting to get confident in what we do, so I feel like that's helping us grind games out.”
The Catamounts nearly levelled the score moments later, as they hit the bar with a shot from the edge of the box after the Crimson failed to clear a cross in the eighth minute. The ball bounced down onto the goal line but was cleared, and Harvard maintained the early lead.
Although the Crimson outshot Vermont 6-2 in the first half, with five of those on target compared to zero for the Catamounts, the teams stayed close through the first 45 minutes, with both sides registering chances despite Harvard holding the majority of the ball.
Tensions flared early in the second half, with Vermont committing five fouls in the first six minutes of the half and receiving a yellow card on the fifth offense. The Catamounts finished the game with a whopping 25 fouls, compared to the Crimson’s 13.
The Catamounts levelled the match in the 62nd minute after junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson was unable to keep out a first-time shot from Vermont’s sophomore midfielder Jacob Vitale. Vitale poked the ball into the bottom corner after the Catamounts worked the ball down the left flank and whipped a low cross across the Harvard box. It was not immediately clear that the ball had crossed the line, but the goal was given despite the protests of Nilsson.
As the game progressed into overtime, the Crimson continued to create chances but was not able to find a breakthrough until the 107th minute. Sophomore midfielder Willem Ebbinge drove into the box and had a shot deflected, which fell to the feet of Arlotti in front of the goal. The young forward smashed the ball into the bottom of the crossbar, deflecting down and over the line, before being mobbed by the Harvard bench.
Vermont came into the game at 5-1-1, shutting out its opponents in its first five games and racking up a plus-8 goal differential through its first seven matches, and was probably the best team the Crimson has faced so far this season.
“We have 25 to 30 people who can make an impact on the game which makes the team competitive in practice,” said Bencsik of the team’s contributions off the bench. “And it gives us energy when we can use other players to step into the game and make an impact.”
Harvard heads up to New Hampshire on Tuesday at 6 p.m. for its final match before starting Ivy League play at Yale next Saturday at 7 p.m.
