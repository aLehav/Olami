After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


Super Bowl 50 will likely be remembered as the year in which a spectacular Denver defense carried aging titan Peyton Manning to the championship. It will be remembered as the year in which the halftime show—Coldplay, featuring Beyoncé and Bruno Mars—was for once actually quite good.
It will not be remembered for its commercials. But there’s something worth saying about them nonetheless. This year, expensive products that represent major investments for their consumers—cars, for instance—were advertised well, while inexpensive products were generally advertised badly.
While that seems reasonable enough, it’s in fact quite a break with the past. Here are some big names in TV advertising over the past decade: Budweiser. Coca-Cola. Michelob Ultra. Bud Light. These businesses are built on selling an enormous number of drinks, usually in competition with nearly identical beverage brands—which means that branding is incredibly important and that these companies pour fortunes into advertising.
In the past, that time and money showed. Budweiser’s Clydesdale ads from 2013, 2014, and 2015 are masterpieces of silent acting, music editing, and finely tuned emotional resonance. They’re better than most films. I cried while watching them.
This year, Budweiser ran two ads. One featured Helen Mirren telling off drunk drivers. The other was a melodramatic proclamation that drinking Budweiser meant taking a stand against the insidious forces of…craft beer? The only context in which anyone will ever link to those ads again is as part of a course in poor brand management.
Year after year, Coca-Cola produced incredibly creative ads, imagining up 30-second worlds revolving around their now-iconic product. This year? Marvel’s Ant-Man tries to steal a Coke from Marvel’s Hulk. There’s no twist. The Hulk just catches him and takes it back.
Michelob Ultra put out one ad, which consisted of people grunting. Bud Light put out one ad, in which Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen somehow became tiresome within only 30 seconds. These are companies that had been producing elaborate, long-running ad campaigns. What happened?
Then look at cars, a field in which brand management matters almost as much. This Super Bowl Hyundai, Audi, Buick, Acura, Toyota, Jeep, and Kia all bought ads. Not one of those companies stumbled last night.
Some did better than others, of course. Audi released a fortuitously timed ad about a retired astronaut featuring David Bowie’s “Starman.” Toyota put out a funny and self-aware two-parter about a gang of bank robbers, forced to drive a Prius as their getaway car, who manage to elude police with their surprisingly effective vehicle. Jeep released a catchy song of their own, “4x4ever,” along with an unexpectedly moving set of reminiscences about their 75-year history. All of these ads work to create some kind of impression on the audience, whether it’s the wistfulness of the Audi ad, the joking familiarity of the Prius, or the forceful nostalgia of the Jeep. And no car ad raised the question that every beverage ad did: Why was the company willing to pay the five million dollar Super Bowl price for this terrible ad?
It’s not just about drinks and cars. Other high-investment products were also advertised well. T-Mobile produced two clever anti-Verizon ads, one featuring Steve Harvey and the other featuring Drake. Lots of other low-investment products were advertised badly, but why list those? No one will remember them.
One Super Bowl isn’t quite enough evidence to declare a new epoch in advertising. But in the meantime, some advice to Budweiser, Coca-Cola, and every other company unwilling to pay more for better ads. There’s no dumber purchase than a 5 million dollar picture frame with no painting to put inside it.

The Coen brothers’ “Hail, Caesar!” is a light comedy (really, borderline farce) about a “fixer”— someone responsible for hiding potential scandals from the public eye—for a large 1950’s film studio. As such, it should not be an exceptionally subtle film—light comedies are rarely subtle, especially movies that have their roots solidly in the competent-company-man genre exemplified by James Cagney showpiece “One, Two, Three.” And it cannot be denied that “Hail, Caesar!” is an incredible success as a member of this genre. But what makes “Hail, Caesar!” an exceptional piece of art is not the fact that it is very amusing but the fact that it is very serious. At the film’s heart and permeating every facet of the action is a compelling argument about the imperfectability of man and the impossibility of realizing utopias.
Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a “fixer” at Capitol Studios, which is currently producing a massive biblical epic à la “The Robe” and “Ben Hur”—the titular “Hail, Caesar!” (subtitled “A Tale of the Christ”). For a man in such a grungy job, handling the occasionally sordid problems faced by studio actors, he is extremely fastidious in his own life: he goes to confession nearly daily and frets about quitting his cigarette habit. When Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), the leading man for “Hail, Caesar!” is kidnapped by a mysterious political syndicate calling itself “The Future,” Mannix faces the hardest task his job has brought him so far.
The ensemble cast performs flawlessly. Even small roles—Jonah Hill’s imperturbable surety agent, Robert Picardo’s dyspeptic rabbi—are brought vividly to life. Clooney’s performance is remarkably subtle and deadpan: There is not even a hint of self-parody in his performance as a clueless, self-serious, self-absorbed, and tremendously wealthy strong-jawed leading man. Relative unknown Alden Ehrenreich’s performance as cowboy actor Hobie Doyle is also impressive, bringing gentleness to a caricature that could easily receive a more mean-spirited treatment. The biggest surprise is perhaps Channing Tatum’s tap-and-song routine, in which Tatum proves himself to be an accomplished practitioner of musical theater.
In addition to the exceptional acting, the cinematography of “Hail, Caesar!” is gorgeous. The Coen brothers’ representation of massive studio-era spectacles is almost overwhelming; Irving Berlin-style tap routines, aquatic dance arrangements, and the masses of Roman-garbed extras are rendered in lush, expansive, and CGI-unmolested detail. The visual style is more understated and less patently bizarre than early Coen brothers productions like “Fargo” or “Raising Arizona” but still maintains the duo’s signature striking framing. The product is exactly what one would expect from an homage to Cecil B. DeMille made by the Coen brothers.
What makes “Hail, Caesar!” more than a well-made tribute, however, is the underlying coherence of concept explored in the story: the obsession with the perfection of human circumstances. Mannix is a man whose passion is making things perfect, whether it be his studio’s productions—an opening scene shows him leading a focus group of religious leaders to make sure that “Hail, Caesar!” has a perfect depiction of Christ—or himself. The Future is concerned with the creation of an ideal society. Starlet DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is concerned with finding the perfect man. “Hail, Caesar!” is about the unrealizability of these visions and the necessity of accepting reality’s warts. In the film’s final scene, Whitlock gives his emotional final speech before the crucified Christ. The crew shows signs of inspiration and wonder until Whitlock forgets his final word—“faith”—and begins swearing. At the film’s heart is an affirmation of the human inability to realize divinity.
“Hail, Caesar!” is a very funny movie with a very serious philosophical heart, perhaps the most serious of any Coen brothers movie, and it is baffling and disappointing that it is appearing in the dead post-Oscar nominations month of February. It is a film that deserves real attention.

The Harvard Art Museums’ new exhibition, “Everywhen: The Eternal Present in Indigenous Art from Australia,” showcases the unique conceptions of temporality in the art of Australia’s Indigenous people. The galleries, which opened on Feb. 4, contain a wide variety of pieces by contemporary Indigenous artists, connected by their exploration of Indigenous Australian history, society, and artistic traditions.
The exhibition includes more than 70 works of art in various media, most of them created in the past 40 years. Accompanying the contemporary works are historical and cultural objects on loan from Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. More than a simple celebration of aesthetics, the exhibition also reflects on the violent history of ethnic cleansing in Australia and modern efforts to reconnect with the country’s pre-colonial past.
Stephen Gilchrist, an art historian based at the University of Sydney and a member of the Yamatji people of Western Australia, guest curated the exhibition for the Harvard Art Museums. Gilchrist says that the project was born out of the museums’ desire to “represent cultures that were not necessarily represented in the [permanent] collection.”
According to Gilchrist,  the temporal theme of “Everywhen” was his effort to balance the uniqueness of Indigenous art with a universal principle. The word “Everywhen” in the exhibition’s title was first used in the 1960s by Australian anthropologist William Stanner to describe his understanding of the Indigenous conception of time as cyclical and continuous. “I wanted it to be expansive and about something that was completely relatable, like time, but [I wanted viewers] to realize that time is culturally subjective and that it has been overdetermined in certain ways,” Gilchrist says. Through this exhibition showcasing contemporary Indigenous artistic production, Gilchrist says that he hopes to “mobilize powerful ideas of collective power and indigeneity.”
Following Gilchrist’s opening address in the museums’ Menschel Hall, Indigenous Australian artist Vernon Ah Kee, whose text-based installation “many lies” is part of the exhibition, joined him for a conversation onstage. Ah Kee said that “many lies,” a cascading word poem written in a stream-of-consciousness style, is “spoken from a voice of someone who has nothing left to lose.”
Ah Kee further explains in an interview that the black-and-white printed text of his work, which contrasts with the organic materials traditionally employed in Indigenous Australian art, reflects his goal of “remov[ing] [his] people from the status of historical record to modern people.”
Ah Kee is also quick to note that the Indigenous Australian story remains relevant today, given the struggles of Indigenous peoples around the world. Ah Kee says that his art “is not about trying to step away from my life and make political statements about it. This is my life.”
The exhibition itself also made reference to experiences of dispossession outside Australia. The opening included a traditional Australian “Welcome to Country and Acknowledgment of Country” protocol, which acknowledges traditional guardianship of land. During this ceremony, which included a Native American prayer and was held in Menschel Hall, the Harvard Art Museums recognized the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, the Wampanoag tribe of Gay Head, the Nipmuc Nation, and the Massachusett people, on whose land the museum buildings now stand.
Darragh J. Nolan ’16, a regular visitor to the Harvard Art Museums, says that he finds the modernity of the art in the exhibition refreshing. “It’s cool [to see] not just historical examples of aboriginal art but contemporary examples as well,” he says.
Helen Ji Li, another visitor to the museum, says that she found the exhibition engaging. “It’s a great opportunity to see the work of aboriginal artists firsthand,” she says.
“Everywhen” will be on view in the Special Exhibitions Gallery at the Harvard Art Museums through Sept. 18.

In the latest contemporary installation at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, “Pneuma(tic) Bodies,” viewers themselves become part of the works on display when they walk through the door. The lobby of the Carpenter Center now contains three large plastic balloon-like structures, continuously ventilated by tiny air-cooling systems. The sculptures are aerated so delicately that anyone passing by can alter their shape just by their breath or the currents of air displaced by their movements through space. In this way, viewers make bodily contact with the artworks using their eyes, lungs, and limbs.
“Pneuma(tic) Bodies” was brought to Harvard by C. Alexander Häusler, a practicing architect who studied at Harvard, and Silvia Benedito, assistant professor of landscape architecture at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. “They are this really interesting breed, because they’re both makers,” Daisy K. Nam, Assistant Director at the Carpenter Center, says. “They make, as we see here, sculptures and drawings. But they are working architects too, so they also build.”
With their architectural backgrounds, Häusler and Benedito were mindful of the interactive sculptures’ relationship with modernist architect Le Corbusier’s design for the Carpenter Center, completed in 1963. “They, as architects, know the space so well and have studied Le Corbusier really closely, so it’s also a play in this specific site. They really install[ed] the work lending to the space,” Nam says.
A series of large-scale abstract drawings, made by Häusler and Benedito in conjunction with the sculptures, lines the walls of the lobby. According to Nam, these flat works are as interactive as the globular bodies. The paint was applied to the canvases at various speeds, pressures, and length of drying time to create three-dimensional contouring effects. The viewer’s perceptions of the pieces change with the angle from which he or she sees the work. This element of human interaction, according to Nam, is intended to connect the drawings with the exhibition’s sculptural elements.
“This exhibition came together very organically,” James Voorhies, Director of the Carpenter Center, says. “Both Axel [Häusler] and Silvia introduced the idea to have these forms and to explore the relationship between these forms [and] the building and with the way we walk through the lobby.”
The exhibition’s opening reception on Feb. 3 extended further the architects’ responses to the idea of space. Jill Johnson, Harvard’s Director of Dance, gave a performance accompanied by Hans Tutschku, a composer and Director of the Harvard’s Studio for Electroacoustic Composition. “[Benedito] talked to Jill a lot about bodily movements and responding to a space with your body,” Nam says. “I think the exhibit touches on sensorial awareness or acuteness of how your body reacts to a space, so it was important for her to have Jill as part of it.”
Voorhies says that the collaborative aspect of the opening reception spoke to the original ethos of the building, meant to be a meeting point for different departments and disciplines.
According to Nam, the architects also hope to highlight the seemingly obvious, often overlooked presence of air in space. “[Benedito] mentioned to me that air is something that we always forget about,” she says. “It’s so ‘natural,’ but at this point, we’ve basically ruined the air, environmentally. This installation kind of teases out the sensation that you should pay attention to the atmosphere.”
“Pneuma(tic) Bodies” will be on view at the Carpenter Center until Feb. 21.

“Every day that goes by and that frat is still standing is another day that we are not safe!” declares Cassie (Amanda Collins), who finds herself at the center of a nationwide controversy concerning campus violence against women in Melinda Lopez’s original play “Back the Night.” Assault, rape, and death threats are weighty topics, and Lopez’s play comes at a time when anger about sexism, privilege, and related administrative ineptitude is reaching a boiling point. However timely, though, Lopez’s message is muddled by strange plot choices with stranger implications. Running Feb. 4 to Feb. 28 at the Boston Playwrights’ Theatre, “Back the Night” offers excellent stagecraft but frustratingly little clarity about the issues it means to address.
For a while, “Back the Night” develops largely as would be expected in a play about campus violence: Cassie comes to her friends Em (Melissa Jesser) and Sean (Evan Horwitz) with a gash in her forehead received behind a frat house at a “competitive university in your part of the country,” as the program says. They demand action, first from their school and then from their country, but even as they gain momentum, they know the national attention span is short—a clever mechanism that heightens the already significant urgency. The central trio is eminently likable and real; they’re funny, ambitious, loving college students.
But Lopez unexpectedly turns on her characters. By the end of the play, she has implied that nearly every woman on the stage has lied about her own assault experience. During one particularly troubling exchange, a character is accused of making up an assault for attention, and she does not deny it. This development is, perhaps, a pivot to a broader question of whether the ends justify the means, but in this context, it disturbingly perpetuates widely-held, sinister assumptions about women who report rape. Because of Lopez’s choice of subject matter and obvious sympathy for the characters, however, this choice comes across not malicious but bewildering.
Fortunately, even if “Back the Night” disappoints in substance, it—including Lopez’s script—excels in style. In fact, one reason the turn is so shocking is that the “competitive university in your part of the country” feels so real. Lopez gives her characters meaningful, complex relationships and imbues the plot with slow-burning drama. Jesser, Horwitz, and particularly Collins bring depth, subtlety, and humor to their characters, who crack wise about such familiar topics as rich parents, English degrees, and Beyonce-singing a cappella groups. Aided by Michael Underhill’s portrayal, even Brandon, Em’s boyfriend and a seemingly simple “bro” who only gets a few scenes, becomes an honest portrait of the good in fraternities. Ensemble actors Stephanie Clayman and John Kooi acquit themselves admirably in a wide variety of roles, constructing the adult world in which the students find so much wrong.
The production staff also deserves high praise. Director Daniela Varon builds tension throughout, and the play’s final scenes thrill thanks in part to her craftsmanship. Scenic designer Rob Eastman-Mullins’s set is gorgeous. Autumn leaves, Greek letters, and other collegiate imagery unobtrusively but firmly establish the play in its setting. The permanent background flexibly accommodates a range of scenes, with the help of Varon’s creative blocking and David Wilson’s lighting; a conversation in a car, created using only chairs, lights, and pantomime, was surprisingly visually compelling.

It was inevitable: About halfway through the Hasty Pudding’s 50th Man of the Year roast, honoree Joseph Gordon-Levitt finally stripped off his tuxedo to raucous applause and cheering. In the service of a Seth Rogen impression, Gordon-Levitt held a family-sized bag of Funyuns in one hand and a “joint” in the other. Wearing little more than tight-fitting black underwear, he puffed out his bare stomach and deepened his voice, punctuating phrases with an imitation of his “50/50” and “The Night Before” co-star’s distinct guttural laugh.
There were likely few actors more willing to play the role of an improv yes-man than Gordon-Levitt, who was extremely game for all of the surprise sketches during the roast. “I really had no idea—I’d seen some photos of men from show business who I respect very much dressed up in flamboyant costumes, and that’s about all I knew,” he said. “They said there was a roast and that I might have to dress up.”
Earlier in the evening of February 5, Gordon-Levitt dove into the audience after pulling on a Robin unitard backward over his tuxedo, a riff on his role in Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight Rises.” He also tenderly simulated fellatio on a cow (Joshuah B. Campbell ’16) and gave a very physical lap dance to a Russian porn star (David A. Sheynberg ’16)—the latter scene resembling Gordon-Levitt’s 2012 Saturday Night Live monologue, when he cemented his leading man heartthrob status with a shirtless “Magic Mike” striptease that spawned thousands of pelvic thrust GIFs.
As co-roasters Kennedy F.Q. Edmonds ’17 and Lily M. Yarborough ’17 relentlessly slung film puns throughout the evening, various members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals took the stage in cameo appearances as characters from Gordon-Levitt’s filmography, including “Looper,” “Lincoln,” and “(500) Days of Summer.” In a night of unabashed revelry that celebrated the truly ludicrous in entertainment, Gordon-Levitt made a memorable splash on the Farkas Hall stage before ducking upstairs to the press conference room.
It is tempting to stop at the surface level of Gordon-Levitt the entertainer, to walk away amused at his outlandish antics—the byproduct of the Hollywood machine that annually sends two entertainers to Cambridge to kiss the ring of the Hasty Pudding and its eponymous Pudding Pot. But shouldn’t the cerebral Gordon-Levitt defy such shallow expectations? He is the man who once said, referring to America’s pop culture obsession with celebrity, “This all feels like pornography to me.” In that same interview, Gordon-Levitt mentioned struggling with fame and celebrity as a former child star. “Sometimes I feel like people see me as a thing on a screen instead of as a person, which is understandable…. It can be a little uncomfortable, frankly,” he said.
Unsurprisingly, the actor is fiercely private about his family and personal life, which has tended to stay out of the tabloids. “I personally have a thing where I like to protect my family—protect my wife and my child from the kind of attention that my career in show business might bring to them,” Gordon-Levitt said. “And certainly there’s lots of people who are very forthcoming with their family life…but just for us, for our particular family, we prefer not to talk about it much.”
The cynicism, Gordon-Levitt admits, is difficult to shake off. A recent viral internet video of the actor’s appearance on a 1997 episode of “Celebrity Jeopardy” features his overeager response to a question about J.D. Salinger’s “Catcher in the Rye.” “That’s my favorite book!” a long-haired and wide-eyed sixteen-year-old Gordon-Levitt exclaims. But the years have changed his perspective on the popular work about teenage angst and alienation. “When I was like 14, 15, 16, I just identified so strongly with that particular character and that particular book. And I think it’s easy to be cynical, and that’s because the world around us deserves a cynical reaction,” he said after the roast. “A good friend of mine said something I really love, and she said, ‘It’s easy to say what you’re not; it’s hard to say what you are.’” The friend, he joked, went to Columbia.

Dear administrators of Harvard University,
As leaders, students, and, most importantly, members of the Harvard community, we are writing to express our deep concern for Harvard University’s inadequate response to the results of the Sexual Conduct Survey. As a survivor-led and ally-supported campaign, we believe it is time to stop waiting for the administration to take necessary steps and instead take action ourselves.
Last November, we organized a rally in Harvard Yard in order to raise support and awareness for those who have experienced rape and sexual assault. Over 200 community members stood in solidarity to listen to survivors and allies share their powerful stories. Students and faculty of the College spoke about the urgency of sexual assault on the University’s campus and the University’s obligation to make Harvard safe for everyone.
In light of the administration's continued stall in addressing this critical issue, we have decided to write this letter. We hope to focus our efforts on strengthening the Harvard community and ending sexual assault from within through awareness and education efforts. Our three main requests are more funding for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, extensive and uniform training for all SASH tutors, and mandatory sexual assault prevention education for the entire student body, every year.
The petition outlining these three conditions has received over 230 signatures to date.
Clearly, these concerns held by our community must be addressed, and they must be addressed now. Please help us in making our campus a safer and more welcoming environment by instituting the changes listed in the petition. We are sure that we can all agree that every Harvard community member deserves to feel safe.
We welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters with you directly.
Sincerely,Andrea Ortiz & Eriko Kay

Eriko Kay '16 is a visual and environmental studies and studies of women, gender, & sexuality joint concentrator living in Lowell House. Andrea Ortiz '16 is a social studies concentrator living in Kirkland House. Both students helped organize a November 19 rally for action on sexual assault at Harvard.

Amidst an ongoing national debate about the criminal justice system’s treatment of minorities, MJ Knoll-Finn, New York University's Vice President for Enrollment Management, recently asked the Common Application to investigate the value of questions regarding college applicants’ criminal and disciplinary histories. Noting “high rates of school discipline and incarceration among people of color,” Knoll-Finn questioned whether the Common Application’s checkboxes asking applicants to self-report any disciplinary actions taken by their schools after ninth grade or any convictions in a court of law served a productive purpose. She also asked whether these questions have led to an unjust rejection of applicants simply “on the grounds of safety.”
These same questions have been at the center of the national discussion on criminal justice reform. Last month, in response to student protests and a New York City law preventing employers from asking about criminal pasts until the last stages of the hiring process, NYU’s Silver School of Social Work removed the criminal conviction box from its application. In November, President Obama directed federal agencies to stop asking prospective government employees about their criminal histories on initial job applications.
Indisputably, the U.S. criminal justice system has continually failed to serve people of color, and all American institutions need to take steps to correct this history of unequal treatment.  In the context of college admissions, however, the correct response is not to “ban the box.” Rather, universities should approach the application process holistically, in a way that acknowledges the discrimination that exists in the justice system.
If we truly believe that the function of the criminal justice system is rehabilitation—and not simply punishment—we should reflect this attitude in how we perceive and treat those with criminal pasts, especially in the context of education. Much too often, a criminal record is linked with poor access to schooling. If we erect further barriers to education in front of all those with criminal histories, we risk condemning far too many of our fellow citizens to a vicious cycle of hardship and recidivism. Rather than blindly rejecting individuals for checking “yes” or creating byzantine additional procedures for them, colleges should look at the admissions process as an opportunity for applicants to demonstrate rehabilitation. Many schools like NYU already take this attitude towards the criminal history question, and it should be the standard among all American universities.
Of course, a history of criminal activity can still be a valid reason for universities to deny admission. Many colleges instituted the current iteration of "the box" in an effort to address real safety concerns that remain just as legitimate today. When considering whether an applicant has committed an offense worthy of rejection, colleges must simply remain aware of a criminal justice system that has disproportionately punished certain groups.
One way in which some schools could exhibit more such awareness is by eliminating questions that ask applicants whether they have been arrested or cited for certain crimes, even if the incident did not result in conviction. Given the lack of evidence in such cases, these questions are particularly onerous and unjust.
As President Obama put it last month when he announced his decision to "ban the box" on federal job applications, we “should not use criminal history to screen out applicants before we even look at their qualifications.” While we do not suggest banning the box on college applications, we urge that all universities take extra care to ensure that their admissions procedures do not perpetuate broader inequities.

To the editor:
In her recent op-ed, Mayukha Karnam makes an excellent and important point that Greek and Latin are by no means the world’s only classical languages, and the “Languages at Harvard” booklet she cites should do more to reflect that reality.
However, Ms. Karnam errs when she argues that the Department of the Classics should be reformed to include all classical languages, most likely because she seems not to understand that the Classics Department is not, as she apparently believes, “a classical languages department.” Languages form only one part of a curriculum that includes history, archaeology, philosophy, medicine, art, anthropology, and much more. These subjects are integrated into a cohesive whole that forms a comprehensive study of the foundation of Western civilization. A language’s status as a classical language is not, per se, enough to make that language relevant to the unique academic program of the department.
Ms. Karnam alleges that the inclusion of only Greek and Latin in the Department of the Classics is a form of “Eurocentrism” that “prioritize[s] Western culture,” but this allegation demonstrates a misunderstanding of the academic field. It is not the case, as Ms. Karnam seems to imply, that Harvard chose to create a department with classical languages as its focus, but was, through Eurocentrism, able to find only two such languages. Rather, the study of “the Classics” in Western academic tradition is the original field of non-religious study in the Western world, dating back to the Renaissance. Yes, the field “prioritize[s] Western culture”—because that has quite literally been the essence of the field since its inception in universities in the West hundreds of years ago.
The Classics Department does not claim that the West is superior, or that Western classical languages are the only classical languages. It is merely continuing an academic tradition, of which Harvard is a part, that has existed since the earliest days of the Renaissance. Just as I might expect a university in India to have an entire department dedicated to the classical civilization of India, I do not feel it unreasonable, Eurocentric, or discriminatory for a university in the West to have a department dedicated to the classical civilizations that begat Western culture. Including classical Chinese, Sanskrit, and Arabic in the Classics Department’s curriculum would distort the focus of the department and undermine its cohesive, inter-disciplinary curriculum.
Ms. Karnam offers a more promising suggestion when she recommends that if the department’s curriculum is not changed, then its name should be. This should be a matter for further debate. For now, though, it should at least be clear that the curriculum of the Classics Department should remain the same.

Even after Sunday’s loss, it’s impossible to watch Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton play football and not be enthralled. He is dynamic, versatile, and extremely talented. He is a showman who is not afraid to make himself the center of attention, from dancing after a score to posing on the sideline with rappers before the game starts. But to many, this showmanship is the subject of major criticism.
I find this whole phenomenon odd—I can see how his posing for a picture before a game might open him up to criticism not being “in the zone," but the critique of his celebrations seems baseless to me. It is harmless for a man to do a dance move after a first down, yet this exact behavior has spawned “think of the children” letters and the disdain of countless commentators. I have trouble comprehending how dancing ignites indignation in the 21st century.
By no means is Cam Newton above criticism. Newton was kicked out of the University of Florida for a string of disciplinary violations, has had a child out of wedlock with a former stripper, and allegedly sought a large sum of money for his playing services back in college. If we’re going to criticize Cam Newton as a role model, this is where the focus should be. Yet the discussion is invariably about his football-related behavior.
The Cam Newton character concern of the week is that he’s immature because he avoided questions and walked out of his post-Super Bowl interview. That’s probably because Denver Broncos cornerback Chris Harris was unintentionally taunting him from another podium. After the game, no one discussed how Newton graciously congratulated Peyton Manning on the field.
Regardless of whether he handled himself appropriately after the game, it is telling that Newton is indicted for reacting angrily to a sensitive subject while the same behavior is a non-issue for Tom Brady or Peyton Manning. Newton’s behavior is not substantively different from any other quarterbacks’. Yet he is the only one, besides Johnny Manziel, who takes such flak for his celebrations and trash talk.
Johnny Manziel, of course, receives as much criticism as Cam Newton, if not more. The crucial difference is that Newton is predominantly attacked for his in-game behavior, while Manziel’s personal life has come into question after a recent accusation of domestic violence. The only on-field behavior Manziel was critiqued for was his “money sign” back in college. But even that controversy stemmed from his off-field behavior, as it got its potency from accusations that he had taken money for autographs, which is not allowed under NCAA rules.
Ultimately, judgements of Newton’s behavior are influenced by an inherent racial bias that those who judge him do not understand, and that doesn’t just begin and end with Cam Newton. As coaches across America will say, football is so much more than a game, and the critique of Cam Newton is so much more than a critique of one football player. The critique of Cam Newton is a representation of inherently biased racial thought throughout America.
A white friend of mine taking time off from Harvard recently experienced a reaction opposite what Newton has received. Working an inventory job where no one in their wildest dreams would think that he goes to college, let alone Harvard, he was singled out and told that he has potential to “make something of himself” and rise in the company. My friend—the only white worker on a team of 20.
The troubling part is the fact that my friend was not singled out by someone who could accurately assess him. Rather, his complimenter had observed him at a distance for a day. Admittedly, my friend tells me that he’s not even one of the top five hardest workers in his team—that there is no reason that he should be selected as “able for more” out of the group. The only tangible difference between my roommate and his coworkers are his mannerisms and cultural background—certain nuances and behaviors that ingratiate him to the predominantly white management of the company.
While it’s impossible to know for sure, I can’t help wondering if the same bias that made my friend stand out over his white coworkers is at play in Cam Newton’s case. Through the treatment of Cam Newton, we can see how racial bias masquerades as concerns over character. The concern over Cam Newton is the on-field celebrations, not any of the off-field issues that provide material for more substantive concerns. Cam’s off-field behavior is accepted by the status quo, while his on-field behavior is a defiant act against it.
When Cam scores a touchdown and does his Superman dance move, he literally becomes superhuman, transcending the unintentional conditions of racism in America. Cam Newton is a black male unabashedly celebrating in a way that the system has so far rejected, a blemish to the traditionalist cult of football in America. But his transcendence of the system is solely for a moment. After he scores, he gives the ball to a kid in the stands, and since it’s the front row the kid is invariably white. Then he sits back down on the sideline, analyzes the film, and the attention shifts back to the game. The spectacle resumes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shuffling between the Morton Prince House and University Hall, Interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said he is readjusting his work schedule and has no plans to introduce “spanking-new” initiatives.
Dingman, who now splits his days between leading the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of Student Life, took over for former Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde on Feb. 1, just one week after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Lassonde would relinquish the post.
While managing the OSL as administrators search for a replacement dean, Dingman said he plans to rely on personnel at both offices and delegate work to administrators at the FDO.
“There are some very competent people over in the Office of Student Life,” Dingman said. “I’m lucky to be able to count on them to keep trucking.”
In the week since Lassonde’s departure, Dingman said he has focused on “learning more about the job.” He did not specify how long he would remain at the helm of the Office of Student Life, but said Sheila C. Thimba, the College’s dean for administration and finance,  is leading the search for a permanent replacement.
“I don’t have a clearly defined agenda of mine,” Dingman said, who added that launching new initiatives as an interim dean would be inopportune. “I know work that I’ve inherited, and I will be focused largely on that in the short term.”
Dingman, who now leads the office that manages student housing, extracurriculars, and residential tutors, said he will help lead the search for new House masters in Currier House. Dingman added that his new appointment has meant a busier schedule, leading him to delegate work to other administrators at the FDO.
Still, Michael C. Ranen, one of four freshman resident deans, said day-to-day operations at the FDO have remained mostly unchanged.
“We’ve all been taking on some small projects that [Dingman] usually attends to,” he said, although he added the additional workload has not been overwhelming on FDO staff. “We have a very strong office.”
Khurana wrote in an emailed statement that he is “confident in [Dingman’s] ability to steward this important office as we conduct a search for a permanent replacement.”
Since Khurana first detailed Lassonde’s departure, many have praised the former dean and his involvement in student life and questioned his sudden exit. In Mather House, where he still resides, House masters Christie McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten lauded Lassonde for his presence at House events.
In the History department, Lassonde will continue working until at least the end of the 2015-2016 academic year. His course, History 74j: “Children and Childhood in America, 1640-Present,” will meet for a third time this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman seminars have seen “unprecedented demand” this academic year, according to Director of Freshman Seminars Ofrit Liviatan, with more freshmen applying to a wider range of course offerings than in past years.
The number of total seminar applications rose 43 percent, growing from 5,764 applications in the 2014-2015 academic year to 8,262 this year, according to data provided by Liviatan. In addition, 2,122 freshmen applied to seminars this academic year, up from 1,862 last year. Freshmen are allowed to apply to multiple seminars each semester.
“As a result of active recruitment, collaborative efforts on the part of the entire administration, and partnership with department chairs, we have managed to reconfigure the program in 2015-2016,” Liviatan said of the program’s growing popularity. “We have really made wonderful strides in our partnerships with departments and with the higher administration.”
That effort has involved a push for seminar offerings from a wider range of departments and from a larger selection of schools across Harvard. In a printed statement, Liviatan noted new permanent offerings from departments such as Statistics and Sociology, along with seminars taught by professors from nearly every professional school at Harvard.
“The freshman seminar program, its task is to bring to students all that Harvard can offer them,” Liviatan said. “I think this is the best experience we can offer a College student.”
Introduced in 1959, freshman seminars are small courses capped at 12 students that are offered only to first year students at the College. They are taught by professors and are graded exclusively on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis, meaning students do not receive a letter grade at the end of term. These unique aspects are part of their appeal, according to Leviatan, providing students with a chance to sample courses in a low-stress setting.
William A. Schmitt ’19, who took Freshman Seminar 25q: “Understanding Emotions” last fall, said his seminar allowed him to explore the field of psychology, a topic of interest for him, in a less stressful setting.
“I was interested in psychology… and I figured that that freshman seminar would be a nice way to get an introduction to the field without necessarily taking one of the bigger lecture classes,” Schmitt said. He added that after taking his seminar he is no longer sure of his original plans to concentrate in Computer Science.
Liviatan also pointed to the opportunity to interact in a smaller setting with a professor as a draw for freshmen, something that Evan M. Bonsall ’19 found compelling about his seminar, Freshman Seminar 44g: “Public Policy Approaches to Climate Change.”
“I was really interested by the professor who teaches the seminar, professor Richard Cooper,” Bonsall said. “I thought it would be very interesting to learn from somebody who had that kind of real-world experience.”

Thirty-five students declared their candidacy for the 11 open seats on the Undergraduate Council in this year’s midterm election, which will take place from Feb. 9 to Feb. 12.
The number of declared candidates this election is more than twice the number who ran during last year's UC’s midterm election, when the Council had to extend the deadline for declaring candidacies after only two students submitted a declaration to run by the original deadline.
Cabot, Dudley, Eliot, Leverett, Mather, Pforzheimer, and Oak Yard each has one open seat on the Council, while Dunster and Kirkland have two, according to Election Commission chair Matthew C. Estes ’18. Open seats result from the term expirations of Executive Board members or from students who choose to leave the Council after just one semester of their year-long terms.
This election also features increasingly competitive races compared to those in recent years. Although Dudley and Dunster will have noncompetitive elections, there are eight competitive elections this cycle, an increase over the two competitive elections in last year’s midterms and six the year before.
The most competitive election will be in Oak Yard, where 13 students will run for the lone open freshman seat on the Council, made available by the departure of freshman representative Camilla Suarez ’19. Freshmen UC seats have historically been the most competitive, and three of this election’s Oak Yard candidates were previously candidates for their yard during the fall term elections, when 15 candidates ran for Oak Yard seats.
Sophomores make up the largest group of students running for office, with 15 sophomores running across seven different Houses.
Two members of last year’s Executive Committee, Oliver W. Kim ’16 of Leverett House and Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 of Kirkland House, will be running for re-election after the expiration of their terms. Executive Committee members serve calendar-year terms.
The following students have declared their intentions to run for the UC:

Caleb F. Aldrich ’18
Moe K. Ball ’17
Christopher B. Cruz ’18
Sam Leichenger ’18

Harvard College received 39,044 applications for admission to its Class of 2020 this year—setting a new record for admissions the second year in a row by surpassing last year’s 37,305 total applications
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said he attributed the 4.6-percent increase in the number of applicants in part to targeted recruitment aimed at students who might not otherwise consider Harvard, through student and alumni-led programs such as the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative and Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program. According to a press release, close to 25 percent of this year’s applicants received an application fee waiver because of “financial hardship.”
He also said headline-grabbing donations to Harvard from former Microsoft CEO and Crimson editor Steve A. Ballmer ’77 and hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson raised the University’s visibility and factored into the application increase.
“All of this helps gets the word out for us, not just around the country but also around the world,” Fitzsimmons said.
The increased number of applications was accompanied by increased interest in a variety of academic areas. Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath said in a press release that applicants interested in studying the humanities had increased by 7.6 percent, continuing an upward trajectory.
“In some ways, you could argue we’ve been doubling down on the humanities in the past decade or so,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that recent admissions presentations and online information for applicants have highlighted Harvard’s strengths in those fields.
“Too often people are worried too much about what that first job will be after graduation and not enough about being educated broadly,” he said. “We think the humanities are vitally important for everybody.”
The number of applicants considering a concentration in Computer Science saw a sharp increase of 22.1 percent, which McGrath said may have been due to the online popularity of the course CS 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
Fitzsimmons added that increased resources at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—which was renamed for Paulson last year after he donated $400 million to establish the school’s endowment—as well as the accomplishments of former Harvard students in the tech industry, like Ballmer and Facebook CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg, provide “a very persuasive set of possibilities” for students contemplating careers in engineering and computer science.
While applicants’ stated academic interests changed, the minority racial and ethnic composition of the applicant pool barely budged from last year’s numbers: 21.1 percent identified as Asian American, 12.2 percent as Latino, 10.6 percent as African American, and two percent as Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. The gender composition of the applicant pool was split nearly even, with women making up 49.3 percent of this year’s applicants.
“There is intense competition for top students of all kinds, including minority students,” Fitzsimmons said. He called Harvard’s efforts to recruit qualified minority students “very aggressive,” but added that many other colleges and universities do the same.
“If everybody is doing that every year, it’s hard to move the needle very far in one year,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that the more diverse “alumni and alumnae” the College graduates, the more likely they will help recruit and interview applicants to future Harvard classes.
Harvard’s peer institutions also reported new highs in their application pools. Yale received 31,439 applications, according to the Yale Daily News, while the Daily Princetonian reported that Princeton saw 29,313, both of which were record totals for their respective schools.
Harvard has already filled 918 places in its Class of 2020 through its Early Action program. Only 14.8 percent of early applicants were accepted in December—the lowest early acceptance rate since the program was reinstated in 2011.
Overall, last year the College accepted a record low number of applicants from its admissions pool, just 5.3 percent of 37,305 applications.
The Crimson was granted early access to applicant statistics and an interview with Fitzsimmons under the condition that it not release the information until Tuesday morning.

Instead of the usual Mardi Gras beads, an undergraduate-led group is holding a two-day Mardi Gras drive in the Science Center plaza for female hygiene products to donate to local homeless shelters.
Eudora L. Olsen ’17 founded The Hygiene Campaign, a nonprofit that aims to provide feminine hygiene products to homeless women and make the topic of menstruation less taboo. Mardi Bra, a part of a larger non-profit organization, currently acts as a mentor to The Hygiene Campaign and the two are working together to run the drive.
The drive, which specifically seeks tampons, pads, and diva cups, is being held over Monday and Tuesday. 
“The goal is to get women into the habit of buying an extra box when she goes and buys [feminine products] for herself," said Jessie Plotkin, a spokesperson of Mardi Bra.
Olsen said there is lack of feminine hygiene product donations to homeless shelters serving women, and said she believes that gap arises from the absence of conversations surrounding women’s health and menstruation.
“I want to open up a conversation about menstruation, which I think a lot of people, including myself, aren’t completely comfortable with,” Olsen said. “It’s just not a topic that’s talked about.”
The campaign also seeks to highlight the barriers many women face purchasing feminine products, particularly due to luxury taxes on the items in some states.
“A lot of people don’t know about luxury taxes on feminine products, which make them extra inaccessible to women who simply can’t afford the $7 box of whatever they need to live their lives,” Olsen said.
Cambridge resident Manny E. Lusardi, who attended the drive, said the issue of hygiene for homeless women was not just a “women’s issue,” but should be part of a larger societal conversation.
“I think it’s a mistake to just think it’s gendered,” he said. “Men have daughters, have wives, have mothers, so I am willing to help.”
Katie L. Blanton ’18, who participated in the donation drive, said the event is an important chance to “try to make sure we are being active in the community.”
Cambridge City Councilor Jan Devereux volunteered at the event and also cited the importance of Harvard involvement in the community as a whole.
“It's great to see students get involved with issues that are not directly on campus, because we need Harvard students and all university students to be involved in civic issues as well,” she said.
The Mardi Gras donation event is a part of nationwide drive across 15 cities hosting collections for feminine hygiene products to donate to homeless shelters, according to Plotkin.
Olsen urged Harvard students to get involved with supporting women’s health.
“Periods are not an epidemic that will end. It’s a part of every woman’s life and it’s not being talked about. The people who hurt the most from it are the people who already don’t have voices,” she said.

After years of housing woes, Allstonians might be able to breathe a sigh of relief: Rental prices in Allston have gone down over the course of the past year, according to a recent report— and Harvard may have helped.
Carol Ridge-Martinez, the executive director of the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, said she believes Harvard’s recent completion of Continuum, a new residential and retail complex at the corner of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue, may have contributed to the decrease.
“The theory is, if enough new units in the area come online, it softens the existing rental market for the existing housing stock,” Ridge-Martinez said. “We’ve had a couple of large buildings, particularly Continuum, come online [in 2015].”
The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Allston decreased by 6.4 percent in 2015, according to a report authored by Devin O’Brien, the head of strategic marketing for Zumper.com, a rental startup that uses data to analyze the housing market. Across the river, Cambridge locals saw some of the sharpest increases in the region.
The report is based on active listings in the Zumper.com database from December 2014 to December 2015, O’Brien said. The database processes roughly one million rental listings across the United States in any given month, he added.
Ridge-Martinez said she was not sure whether the decrease in Allston’s rental rates is a lasting trend or a mere “blip in the market.” Allstonians have long bemoaned rising rents and decreasing owner occupancy in their neighborhood, as outside investors have scooped property and more students have moved in.
Devin Quirk, the director of operations for Boston’s Department of Neighborhood Development, said rising rental rates in the Boston area constitute a problem the city must address.
Quirk outlined two strategies to reduce rent over the next few years—first, through the construction of new residential facilities, and second, through the creation of affordable housing units.
“Harvard has been an awesome partner in creating new affordable housing in Boston with the help of the Allston Brighton CDC,” Quirk said, referencing Continuum’s 42 lotteried affordable housing apartments. “I think that the production of units of affordable housing is really critical to ensuring that Allston remains affordable.”
Ridge-Martinez, however, said she has reservations about Harvard’s future role in Allston’s development, citing the importance of local feedback in the University’s planning process.
“We have to make sure that what we build in our neighborhoods fits into our neighborhoods and it’s good growth,” she said. “We need to have more community input into what gets built and how it gets built.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 10, 2015, at 11:49 a.m.
Several Harvard professors stand firmly by poll predictions for Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation primary election in New Hampshire: businessman Donald J. Trump will win among the Republicans, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders among the Democrats.
The most recent CNN poll from New Hampshire shows Trump with 33 percent of surveyed Republican primary voters, ahead of Senators Marco A. Rubio and Ted Cruz, each of whom had 16 percent and 14 percent respectively. On the Democratic side, Sanders leads former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, 58 to 35 percent.
Sanders' grassroots support and pre-election polling numbers in New Hampshire indicate he will likely be the clear winner.
“New Hampshire, of all the 50 states, is probably the best state in the race for Sanders,” Harvard Kennedy School professor Thomas E. Patterson said.
After his narrow loss in Iowa, Sanders needs a decisive victory in New Hampshire, because “if Clinton’s loss is smaller than expected, it will likely diminish his chances,” Patterson said.
This would be an important victory for the underdog from Vermont.  The most recent national Quinnipiac survey put the Sanders two points behind Clinton nationally with 42 percent and 44 percent of the Democratic vote respectively.
After New Hampshire, Sanders will likely face an uphill battle. “The election calendar after New Hampshire begins to favor Clinton,” Patterson said.
For the Republicans, the New Hampshire primary serves as an opportunity to whittle down the number of candidates vying for the nomination. Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93  predicts that candidates will suspend their campaigns if they struggle in New Hampshire.
“I think if Jeb Bush, or Kasich, or Christie don’t get in the top three, it’s over,” he said. “I think New Hampshire has the potential to cut in half the Republicans that are still in the game.”
Though Trump is poised to win by some distance, Rubio, the establishment candidate who McCarthy said thrived in the Iowa caucuses, may overtake the New York businessman.
An upset against Trump could be detrimental to his campaign. “If he doesn’t win in New Hampshire, that’s a huge problem for him,”  McCarthy said.
Patterson, however, maintained that he felt Trump would prevail.
“The question is whether Trump can translate his poll popularity to votes? It looks like he’ll be able to do that in New Hampshire and that will increase his credibility as a candidate,” Patterson said.
On both sides, the New Hampshire primary plays a key role in establishing leaders from both parties and sets the tone for the primary elections and caucuses to follow.
“It’s the first real vote test of candidacies,” Patterson said. “It’s a source of momentum.  If you win there, you get more media attention, you get more funds flowing into your campaign, and you can carry that into subsequent states.”
While the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary are important in their signalling effect to candidates, it is dangerous to allow the results to over-inform the voting choices of Americans more broadly, McCarthy said.
“I think that as the country moves to a majority of color-people country in the next generation, Iowa and New Hampshire will remain even more disproportionately white and that becomes even more of a problem,” he said. “The weight of those victories gets undue power in the way the election gets spun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Behind Loeb House’s closed doors, two undergraduates met Sunday with Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body, to discuss the College’s social life, among other topics.
Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the former president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council respectively, spoke on a panel that focused on “undergraduate life outside the classroom,” according to interim Dean of Student Life  Thomas A. Dingman ’67. Two House masters, Anne Harrington ’82 of Pforzheimer and Howard Georgi ’68 of Leverett, joined Dingman and the undergraduates at the meeting, according to Dingman.
Dingman said the panel talked about bringing student parties back to College-sponsored venues—a recent focus of top College administrators. 
“It was a lot about trying to recenter student life into the Yard and the Houses. We talked about some of the programming initiatives,” Dingman said.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, a vocal critic of the College’s single-gendered social organizations, organized the panel, according to Dingman. Dingman did not comment on many specifics of the meeting. Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal also would not comment on what the panel discussed, saying the meeting was “confidential.” Of the six members of the Board of Overseers contacted, none could be reached for comment.
Goyal said he and Nasrollahzadeh met with Khurana and Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich last week to prepare for the meeting. Friedrich first invited Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal on Jan. 26, according to Goyal. Both Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal are involved in several student groups, including unrecognized and off-campus social organizations.
“We were excited to be able to share student perspective on important questions concerning the College and we hope that the practice of including student voices continues,” Nasrollahzadeh said.
The meeting comes a week after sitting UC President and Vice President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17 said students would meet informally with the Overseers. Rather and Banks campaigned on a platform calling for Harvard to elect an undergraduate to the Board of Overseers, a body historically composed of Harvard alumni.
The meeting also follows recent efforts from administrators who have criticized the College’s unrecognized social groups and pushed to bolster student life in the Houses. Under Khurana’s leadership, Cabot House recently opened a designated party space dubbed “The Aquarium” and streamlined its party registration process.
As College administrators pressure final clubs to admit  women, off-campus social life has undergone a series of changes. In the fall, two historically male final clubs accepted women as members for the first time. One of the groups, the Fox Club, cited pressure from Harvard administrators as an impetus to go co-ed. In May 2015, a University task force on sexual assault prevention recommended that each of Harvard’s schools reconsider its policies about social spaces, both on and off campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 9, 2016, at 9:16 a.m.
In the past few years, CS50 instructor David J. Malan ’99 and the University have filed contradictory applications to trademark the course, a set of public documents indicate. Public records also indicate that Malan formed a now-dissolved “education consulting” business called “CS50 LLC” in 2011.
One of the largest courses at Harvard, CS50—an introductory computer science class with a massive online audience and satellite operations at Yale—has generated both excitement and controversy since Malan took the helm in 2007. During Malan’s time as head instructor, the course has boasted consistently high marks in student evaluations and garnered praise from faculty and administrators. Some students, however, have criticized the course’s corporate sponsorship and large, enthusiastic following. 
Between 2011 and 2012, Malan—who did not respond to repeated phone calls and email requests for comment—filed at least four applications to trademark “CS50” and “THIS IS CS50,” a recognizable tagline for the course. The applications were filed with the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office; In the original application, “CS50” was first described as “educational and entertainment services,” including class material and lectures, as well as “education consulting related thereto.”
In September 2011, five months after submitting his first trademark applications, Malan filed a certificate of organization with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth for “CS50 LLC,” a limited liability company.
Malan’s two initial applications stalled after the trademark office processing his requests sent him multiple rounds of necessary revisions.
According to Rebecca L. Tushnet ’95, a trademark expert at Georgetown Law School, barriers often arise when an applicant applies for a trademark without an attorney; none of Malan’s applications lists an attorney. In September 2012, Malan submitted another, separate round of applications for “CS50” and “THIS IS CS50,” which were routed to a different law office at the Trademark and Patent Office.
In early November 2012, Malan’s original application for the “CS50” trademark was published for opposition in the “Trademark Official Gazette” on Nov. 6, 2012, which begins a 30-day period that provides anyone the opportunity to file opposition to the registration. On Nov. 27, the application for “THIS IS CS50” was published.
Three days before the end of the opposition period for “CS50,” however, Harvard— through outside attorney Thomas L. Holt— filed a successful request to extend the opposition period on both applications. Harvard had until March 6, 2013, to file formal opposition to the “CS50” application and until March 27 for “THIS IS CS50.”
Had Harvard not intervened, the trademark likely would have proceeded to the final stages of the registration process.
On Feb. 19, 2013—before Harvard filed any formal opposition to the trademarks—Malan filed to “abandon” all of his active trademark applications, according to the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office’s website. 
He also did not file mandatory annual reports for CS50 LLC after 2012, which led to its dissolution by the Secretary of the Commonwealth in June 2015, according to the office. On March 1, 2013, 10 days after abandoning his trademark applications, Malan filed a certificate of organization for “50 LLC,” listing the same address as CS50 LLC, and describing the “general character of the business” as “commercial and educational software, hardware, content, and services.”
50 LLC remains a registered limited liability company with the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office. According to the office, the company is in danger of dissolution because it has not filed an annual report since its founding in 2013.
Tushnet, the trademark expert, said that from an outsider’s perspective, the LLC and trademark documentation indicate that Malan may have been interested in creating a CS50 “franchise.” Malan did not respond to requests for comment on Tushnet’s analysis.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven, sitting in on an interview with FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, deferred for the most part to Malan and Harvard’s trademark office for comment, although Smith said Malan updates him regularly.
“[Malan] keeps me well-informed about what's he's doing to make sure he doesn't misstep. He talks to the appropriate people,” Smith said. “He's worked with [the] trademark office to make sure we do things appropriately in that space.”
Copyright expert and Law School professor Jeannie C. Y. Suk said the public records do not provide a full picture. 
“My reading suggests the issues are more complicated than they at first appeared,” Suk wrote in an email.
At the end of the fall semester, meanwhile, Harvard submitted applications to trademark both “CS50” and “CS50x,” the course’s online arm distributed through edX, a Harvard-MIT online education non-profit. Harvard’s trademark application for CS50 includes screen captures of CS50’s course website as well as course materials.
According to Harvard spokesperson David J. Cameron, the applications were filed in part to “protect from potential misuse” because of the course’s “broad online presence.”
Cameron declined to discuss Malan’s previous trademark applications, Harvard’s successful extension of the opposition period, CS50 and 50 LLCs, or who in the Harvard administration made the decision to pursue the trademark. Holt, the lawyer who filed Harvard’s request for extension of the trademark applications’ opposition period, said he was “not authorized” to comment.
While CS50 is the only individual course on Harvard’s “non-exhaustive” list of registered or pending trademarks, Tushnet said that “Harvard is notoriously highly protective of its trademarks and related intellectual property.”
According to Tushnet, the law usually favors universities over the course instructors if a dispute arises over intellectual property.
Harvard’s policy on intellectual property states that “The University shall own all patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights in Sponsored Computer Software.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 9, 2016, at 12:48 p.m.
Over the past several months, tensions have flared at Harvard Law School over the treatment of minorities on campus. An incident of vandalism investigated as a hate crime sparked outrage, and the school seal’s historic connection to slavery has become the center of heated discussion.
A wave of student protests at the Law School followed. On Nov. 19, Law School affiliates walked into Wasserstein Hall, a main thoroughfare on campus, to discover pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of black faculty members. The incident, which remains unresolved after police investigated it as a hate crime, prompted debate about race relations on campus; student activists continue to push for better treatment of minorities. The group Reclaim Harvard Law issued a series of demands to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, calling on the school to create a critical race theory program, diversify its faculty, and change the school’s controversial seal—which bears the crest of a former slaveholding family. 
These continued debates are not confined to the Law School’s campus. Alumni from across the country have closely followed recent developments, contacting students and penning articles. And as donors well-trained in the art of argument, Law School alumni remain vocal on issues affecting the school, including ongoing activism.
Through letters, emails, op-eds, and informal conversations, Law School alumni have weighed in on the November black tape incident and ensuing activism, expressing outrage at the taping itself and varying degrees of support for activists. However, alumni attitudes diverge on whether to continue donating in light of campus controversy.
MIXED REACTIONS
In the months since student protests at the Law School crescendoed, alumni have reacted to campus debates, sending letters to student groups and emailing activists and administrators to voice their opinions. Minow has communicated with alumni about campus activism, writing in a Dec. 2 email to alumni that she “invite[s] and welcome[s]” alumni engagement in discussions of race.
The black tape incident in particular sparked strong condemnation from alumni. Leland S. Shelton, a third-year Law Student and president of the Black Law Students Association, said that after the incident, his group received dozens of calls and emails, as well as a letter signed by 11 black alumni who expressed support for black Law students and disgust at the vandalism.
“We saw the photographs of your professors, our friends and colleagues, defaced with black tape, a desecration in a shiny hallway, and we felt an old and familiar ache,” the alumni wrote in their November letter, days after the incident occurred.
David A. Hill—a signatory of the letter who graduated from the Law School in 1991—said in an interview that the black tape was “concerning” and “frankly, that someone would have the audacity to do that in 2015 was surprising.”
Mark A. Price ’98, the president of the Harvard Black Alumni Society, also contacted the Black Law Students Association to voice support for the group in the aftermath of the vandalism, Shelton said.
While alumni on the whole responded to the black tape incident with outrage, they remain divided over some current students’ calls for deeper, institutional change at the Law School. Specifically, alumni have articulated differing opinions toward the call to change the school’s seal, according to Alexander J. Clayborne, a member of Royall Must Fall, a student group leading that charge. Any decision on the status of the seal awaits recommendations from a committee Minow convened in the fall, slated to come out in March. 
While some alumni have directly contacted student groups, others have taken a more public stance, penning letters to the editor in The Crimson and The Harvard Law Record that offer conflicting viewpoints on the seal.
Some other alumni, however, question the scope and pervasiveness of racism at the Law School. Prominent entertainment attorney Bertram H. Fields, who graduated in 1952, dismissed what activists have characterized as pervasive problems of diversity at the school, drawing  what he considers a distinction between these allegations and overt acts of racism like the black tape incident.
“The entire subject of diversity is really a subject divorced from somebody putting black tape on someone’s portraits,” Fields said. “I don’t like to see people confuse one with the other. Nobody can rationally condone putting black tape on those portraits—that’s disgusting. On the other hand, diversity is not quite that easy.”
THE DONATION QUESTION
Some people are questioning how, if at all, student activism will affect the Law School’s fundraising.
The tide of diversity activism comes shortly after  the public launch of the Law School’s capital campaign, and in light of racial turmoil on campus, some activists have called on alumni to stop donating. This plea has had little financial effect so far, according to Steven Oliveira, the Law School’s dean for development and alumni relations. But the idea has stirred debate.
That idea originated with third-year Law student Bianca S. Tylek. Tylek, a Latina student born to immigrant parents, became a public face of the campaign when she delivered an emotional speech to donors at the launch, relaying her personal story of overcoming hardship and urging them to support the Law School.
But a month later, after seeing black tape stuck across portraits of her black professors and what she considered insufficient response by administrators, Tylek penned an op-ed for The Boston Globe, asking alumni to withhold donations as a form of protest until administrators meet activists’ demands.
For Tylek, who is a member of Reclaim Harvard Law, communicating this opinion to alumni was both a moral obligation and a strategic move, since alumni fund much of the school’s operations.
In her article, Tylek encourages alumni to donate to affinity groups in lieu of the Law School itself. Shelton said some alumni have offered to donate to the Black Law Students Association, which does not currently have the structure in place to accept direct donations. Shelton said he has encouraged alumni to give to the Law School with the stipulation that funds go toward the group.
Some alumni support the focused approach. Hill said he is considering contributing to a targeted campaign led by other black alumni in the Law School class of 1991 for their 25th reunion. Funds raised would go toward supporting current and future black Law students.
More broadly, the op-ed’s reception was mixed. Tylek said she has received messages of support from students and younger alumni in particular, but some major donors have questioned her argument.
Some strongly condemned the black tape incident and urged students to continue combating racism, but they expressed support for administrators and did not feel compelled to stop donating.
Law School alumna Lynn A. Savarese, a self-described major donor and a former chair of the school’s Annual Fund, said that while she is “happy” to observe the recent activism, she will continue to support the school.  Savarese attended the campaign launch and said she was puzzled by Tylek’s change of heart.
“I was there when she spoke,”  Savarese said. “ I was among many who were really touched by what she had to say, and therefore very troubled and confused about what she had to say in the Boston Globe piece.”
Fields, who donated $5 million to endow a professorship at the school in 2014, echoed this sentiment.
“I don’t understand why donors should not donate to the Law School because some moron, some racist decided to put black tape on some portraits,” Fields said. “I don’t know why that is a reason people should not give to a place… that always stood up for values and understanding.”
Several major donors said they continued to support the school because they were loyal to Minow.
“I salute the students for caring enough to give the Law School hell,” Law School alumnus Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82, a legal analyst for CNN and a former Crimson sports editor, said. “But I’m still a loyal alum and an enthusiastic supporter of Martha Minow, and I don’t think those views are contradictory.”
Some alumni are more hesitant to financially support the school. Hill has long withheld donations as a form of protest, vowing when he was a student never to donate to the Law School as long as then-dean Robert C. Clark, whose stance on hiring female minority professors he had disagreed with, was still an affiliate.
Anisha S. Queen, a 2014 Law School graduate, said she feels conflicted over donations.
“It’s a catch-22,” she said. “On the one hand, it’s through those donations that I got the education and network that I did. But on the other hand, it’s possible you are giving to an institution that perpetuates racism.”
While Tylek’s op-ed has provoked discussion, it has not significantly affected the school’s capital campaign. Oliveira declined to disclose the most recent fundraising figures, but wrote in an email that the campaign is doing well.
“We haven't seen any particular correlation between student activism on diversity issues and the commitment of our alumni to supporting the important goals of the campaign. Certainly not a negative one,” he wrote. “My sense is that, if anything, just about everybody seems to understand that a successful campaign will only strengthen the Law School's diversity mission in all kinds of ways, especially through financial aid.”
Campaign co-chair Morgan Chu, who graduated from the Law School in 1976, declined to comment.
While it appears unlikely that alumni will stop donating, some leading donors agree with activists that current protests present an opportunity for donors to evaluate how the Law School is using their money.
“I don’t think it [the activism] should scare donors away,” Savarese said. “I think it should encourage them to examine more carefully the policies that currently exist at the school and engage in the debate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College received 39,044 applications for admission to its Class of 2020—setting a new record for admissions the second year in a row and surpassing last year’s 37,305 total applications. 
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said he attributed the 4.6 percent increase in the number of applicants in part to targeted recruitment aimed at students who might not otherwise consider Harvard, through student and alumni-led programs such as the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative and Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program. According to a press release, close to 25 percent of this year’s applicants received an application fee waiver because of “financial hardship.”
Fitzsimmons also said headline-grabbing donations to Harvard from former Microsoft CEO Steve A. Ballmer ’77 and hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson increased Harvard's visibility and could have factored into the application increase.
“All of this helps gets the word out for us, not just around the country but also around the world,” Fitzsimmons said.
The increased number of applications was accompanied by deepening interest in a variety of academic areas. Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath said in a press release that applicants interested in studying the humanities had increased by 7.6 percent, continuing an upward trajectory.
“In some ways, you could argue we’ve been doubling down on the humanities in the past decade or so,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that recent admissions presentations and online information for applicants have highlighted Harvard’s strengths in those fields.
“Too often people are worried too much about what that first job will be after graduation and not enough about being educated broadly,” he said. “We think the humanities are vitally important for everybody.”
The number of applicants considering a concentration in Computer Science increased sharply, by  22.1 percent, which McGrath said may have been due to the online popularity of the course Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
Fitzsimmons added that increased resources at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—which was renamed for Paulson last year after he donated $400 million to establish the school’s endowment—as well as the accomplishments of former Harvard students in the tech industry, like Ballmer and Facebook CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg, provide “a very persuasive set of possibilities” for students contemplating careers in engineering and computer science.
While applicants’ stated academic interests changed, the minority racial and ethnic composition of the applicant pool barely budged from last year’s numbers: 21.1 percent identified as Asian American, 12.2 percent as Latino, 10.6 percent as African American, and two percent as Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. The gender composition of the applicant pool was split nearly even, with women making up 49.3 percent of this year’s applicants.
“There is intense competition for top students of all kinds, including minority students,” Fitzsimmons said. He called Harvard’s efforts to recruit qualified minority students “very aggressive,” but added that many other colleges and universities do the same.
“If everybody is doing that every year, it’s hard to move the needle very far in one year,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that the more diverse “alumni and alumnae” the College graduates, the more likely they will help recruit and interview applicants to future Harvard classes.
Harvard’s peer institutions also reported new highs in their application pools. Yale received 31,439 applications, according to the Yale Daily News, while the Daily Princetonian reported that Princeton saw 29,313 applications. Both numbers of applicants were record totals for their respective schools.
Harvard has already offered admission to 918 students to the Class of 2020 through its Early Action program. Only 14.8 percent of early applicants were accepted in December—the lowest early acceptance rate since the program was reinstated in 2011.
Last year the College accepted a record low number of applicants from its admissions pool, just 5.3 percent of 37,305 applications.
The Crimson was granted early access to applicant statistics and an interview with Fitzsimmons under the condition that it not release the information until Tuesday morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—One goal. In order to keep its dream of bringing the Beanpot back to Cambridge for the first time since 1993 alive, the Harvard men’s hockey team needed one goal to push Boston College to overtime last Monday.
But while the Crimson needed a goal, all it could produce was a shot. Eagles goalie Thatcher Demko was asked to make just one save in the final 11 minutes, as now-No. 3/3 Boston College comfortably knocked Harvard into its eighth straight consolation game.
In the ensuing Monday matinee against Northeastern, more than just the Crimson offense went missing. Per Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, the No. 9/9 Crimson (13-7-3, 9-4-3 ECAC) spent the evening seeking shortcuts, and Donato’s side ultimately paid the price as Northeastern (10-13-5, 4-8-4 Hockey East) pummeled Harvard, 5-1, at TD Garden.
The Huskies, now unbeaten in 10 of their last 11 games, struck three times in the opening period, the first of which came less than four minutes in after co-captain Kyle Criscuolo fell down in the middle of the slot. Taking advantage of the open shooting late in front of the fallen forward, associate captain Mike McMurtry zipped a shot past freshman goaltender Michael Lackey at 3:56 to push Northeastern in front early.
Eight minutes later, McMurtry put his name on the scoring sheet a second time, centering a pass for freshman center Adam Gaudette, who beat Lackey glove-side to double the lead.
Then in the frame’s final minute, the Huskies tacked on one more as sophomore forward Dylan Sikura, alone on Lackey’s right post, hammered home a feed from associate captain John Stevens to send Northeastern into the break up three.
“I thought our kids played really well in the first period,” Northeastern coach Jim Madigan said. “We played with pace, we were transitioning pucks quickly, and I think we took a little bit of advantage of Harvard, who had two games this weekend.”
After falling short against Yale at the Whale two days prior, Harvard could not muster the energy to keep up with the Huskies. The Crimson’s most well-rested player was in fact Lackey, who had been listed second on the depth chart to sophomore Merrick Madsen for the past six games. But after making consecutive starts this past weekend and looking less than sharp, Madsen gave way to the freshman for the first time since Jan. 16.
The experiment was not a success, however, as Lackey surrendered three goals in a single period for the third time in his last four starts. Yet with Harvard’s defense struggling to hold Northeastern—particularly its second line—in check, Lackey was hardly to fault on Monday.
“I really felt our goaltender was left hanging out there,” Donato said. “[Those] certainly weren’t easy save opportunities for him. I thought we turned the puck over, got beat up the ice...and we just weren’t willing to play the type of game that will give us a chance to be competitive.”
The Huskies’ second line of McMurtry, Gaudette, and Sikura accounted for four goals on the night, the latter of which was scored by Gaudette on the power play with 9:53 remaining. Meanwhile, for the first time as members of the same unit, Criscuolo, Jimmy Vesey, and Alexander Kerfoot all finished minus-three for the night.
“You have to play a little bit heavy on those three players because they’re skilled,” Madigan said. “I thought we kept the puck in the offensive zone when they were on the ice for a period of time, so that negates them.”
“I said to Coach Keefe, who was changing lines, that we pinned them in their zone a few times, and then those three still had a lot of energy left,” he added. “We had to get our second line ready to go against them because they still had about another 20 seconds of energy going. But they’re great players, and I thought we did a good job tonight in containing them.”
Freshman forward Ryan Donato put a dent in Northeastern’s 3-0 lead off an offensive zone faceoff a little over 10 minutes into the middle frame. The rookie skated on the second line for the third straight game Monday—this time alongside senior Colin Blackwell and junior Luke Esposito after junior Sean Malone was suspended one game for his role in an altercation with Yale defenseman Rob O’Gara on Saturday.
“We certainly have other guys who have shown themselves very capable of stepping in and playing well for us,” Ted Donato said. “But as a group, we had a lot more passengers than we did have guys that were prepared to play the type of game we would have needed to play to have success.”
The rookie’s second Beanpot goal, paired with a holding penalty against Northeastern’s Garret Cockerill in the final minute of the second period, gave the Crimson a bit of life heading into the final frame. But the power play expired without Harvard generating a single shot, and the Huskies tacked on two more en route to the 5-1 victory.
With the loss, the Crimson’s descent down the rankings continues. Harvard now sits 11th in the PairWise, leaving the Crimson just a few spots above the NCAA tournament bubble.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­This weekend, Harvard captain Branden Clemens may not have won a championship with the Crimson men’s volleyball team, but he did just about everything else.
On Friday he outdid all players with 18 kills en route to the team’s 3-1 victory over Puerto Rico Mayaguez. The next night, he outdid even himself with a career-high 23 finishes. His previous career best was 19.
Although Harvard lost the second match, 3-2, after a 15-13 tiebreaker, Clemens ended the weekend tournament with 48 points. He committed just nine errors and added six blocks.
“I think that [our hunger] could be a good thing heading into this coming weekend,” Clemens said. “It might be better [to lose now] because this weekend’s performance might make us practice a little harder and make us realize that we still have work to do.”
That hunger was clearly seen in both matches this weekend, beginning with the opener against the Bulldogs. After falling behind a set, Harvard fought back to win the final three games.
Clemens played a major role in the middle two frames, recording a total of 12 finishes. At one point in the third, he accounted for three straight points.
“This year the general feeling that I’ve gotten is that we’re a very competitive team that is very high-energy,” Clemens said. “It’s still relatively early in the season.”
But arguably the more impressive performance came the next night, when Clemens led the team back from a two-set deficit against the Pride, who have won three of the last four Division III championships for men’s volleyball.
Despite dropping an exhausting 35-33 first frame and despite losing the second in more lopsided fashion, Harvard came back to win both the third and fourth sets. That surge forced a fifth game, which was tied at 13 before Springfield took the tournament title by winning the next two points.
“Sets three and four, we were able to adjust and handle them easily,” senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman said. “It’s just a matter of putting it together for an entire match.”
The bounce-back by the Crimson after the early deficit paralleled Clemens’ strength in both kills and efficiency. As unusual as Clemens’ 23 finishes were, the more remarkable statistic was his .556 efficiency rate for the contest.
That percentage earned him 26.5 points out of his 36 total attacks; rarely does such a high-volume hitter record finishes at such a high mark.
One blemish on the night was his four service errors, which tied three other teammates for tops on the squad. One of these misses came at the end of the fifth set, allowing the Pride to serve for the match.
“The game last night really came down to serve, serve-receive,” Clemens said. “They have a lot of really good jump-servers. That put a lot of pressure on us. If we can handle those kinds of serves better and step it up a little bit…. I think that we can get out of those sticky situations a little quicker.”
Last season, as a junior, he led the team with 295 finishes and also recorded 170 digs. All told, he is eighth in Harvard history in kills and tied for sixth for service aces, with 686 and 60, respectively.
Next weekend, the Crimson will face another stiff test when it is challenged by conference heavyweights Penn State and St. Francis. Both competitors are ranked in the top 15 nationally, and both beat Harvard at least once last year.
As an all-EIVA first team selection last year, Clemens has experience facing these foes. In two of the four games against the Nittany Lions and the Red Flash in 2015, he finished with double-doubles. He has recorded six such performances over the course of his career.

In the not-too-distant future, there may be some relief for a forgetful Valentine. Any lovelorn lout who comes home without flowers will have a quick fix: they can print them.
Scientists at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have pioneered this new “4-D” printing technique, creating printed flowers that, like the real ones, swell and change shape and over time (the fourth of the “D’s,” for those of you who still haven’t taken an SPU) when placed in water.
What’s the secret to the printed flowers? A special kind of “ink.”
While traditional 3-D printing techniques uses plastic filaments, 4-D printing uses hydrogel composite ink to allow for the water saturation that happens to real petals, leaves, and stems. The work was pioneered by Jennifer Lewis, who was familiar with these new types of 3-D printing ink and wanted to see if they could use them to mimic flowers. She partnered with SEAS professor Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan to reverse engineer the way that flowers react to time and water.
Unfortunately, the printed flowers aren’t going to get anybody out of buying the real thing any time soon. According to SEAS and Applied Math Professor Mahadevan, the printed orchids are tiny: only millimeters wide.
While the flowers may be pretty, the techniques that researchers developed also have pretty serious applications. The research could be important for fields like biomedical and tissue engineering. This might explain why the Army Research Office and the National Science Foundation’s Materials Research Science and Engineering Center were funding tiny flowers...but with Valentine’s Day just around the corner, maybe the Army is just hedging their bets.

Updated Thursday, February 11 at 9:50 a.m.
Apparently, there is trouble in paradise. But “trouble” is a trademark spat and “paradise” is the frozen wasteland of Cambridge. Specifically, David J. Malan ’99, the instructor of a certain popular class/form of torture, attempted to trademark “CS50” and “THIS IS CS50,” but Harvard had other plans. While FAS Dean Michael Smith claims Malan is upfront with his trademark goings-on, it is way more fun to imagine David Malan filing trademarks left and right and Drew Faust calling up her attorneys to protect Harvard’s trademark interests.
Since the timeline is a bit complicated and, let’s be serious, people do not give as much of a damn about CS50 as Malan would like to think, let us break it down for you.
2011: Malan attempts to trademark “CS50” and “THIS IS CS50.” His application is unsuccessful, maybe because he submitted it without an attorney (which is a low-key hilarious power move). He decides to incorporate “CS50 LLC.”
2012-2013: Malan tries to trademark “CS50” and “THIS IS CS50”…again. Once again, he doesn’t have an attorney. He’s more of a “DIY” kind of guy. Harvard requests an extension on the opposition period for his initial applications, and Malan withdraws his applications. Instead, Malan incorporates “50 LLC”. That’s right – David Malan now has two corporations, one of which is a course title and the other of which is just a number.
2015: CS50 LLC has not filed an annual report since 2012, so the Commonwealth of Massachusetts dissolves it. David Malan’s only corporate interest now is the number fifty. So sad. To rub salt in the wound, Harvard files applications to trademark “CS50” and “CS50x”.
In an alternate and more representative reality, Malan should have tried to trademark “sadness” and “THIS IS AN ALL-NIGHTER.” Then Harvard could have filed an opposition brief, claiming it had already trademarked both of those things along with “Lamont” and “Math 55.” At least in this fictional scenario Malan would have his limited liability corporation “Let’s See How Many Ivies Will Buy Into This Nonsense LLC”.
