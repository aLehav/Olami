After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company has completed its “five-year” organizational and investment restructuring plan more than one year ahead of schedule, HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar announced in a message to University affiliates Tuesday.
Narvekar began his tenure in December 2016 following a difficult period for the endowment.
In 2016, the University’s endowment dropped $2 billion, its worst set of returns since the 2008 financial crisis.
To revitalize the struggling firm, Narvekar announced a five-year restructuring, beginning with laying off half of HMC’s 230-person staff by the end of 2017.
The primary changes announced in the five-year plan included a shift away from HMC’s unique “hybrid” investment model in which a large in-house team and outside money managers took charge of the endowment’s investments.
The five-year plan officially concluded with the “spin-out” of HMC’s natural resources team into an independent investment firm in October 2020.
Narvekar wrote in Tuesday's report that HMC “benefits meaningfully” from the new “generalist” model where employees focus on overall endowment performance rather than specialized asset classes.
“A fundamental tenet of HMC’s organizational structure and investment approach is a Generalist investment team,” Narvekar wrote. “While we understand the advantages of specialization, HMC benefits meaningfully from having a team of talented and skilled investors who search for the best risk-adjusted returns for the entire portfolio, regardless of investment structure, asset class, or manager.”
Narvekar also wrote in Tuesday’s report that HMC is “comfortable” with early results following the shift. Harvard’s endowment returned 7.3 percent on its investments in fiscal year 2020, bringing its total to $41.9 billion, the largest sum in its history.
Nevertheless, Narvekar noted that HMC remains focused on the endowment’s long-term returns.
“Of course, we note that we need ten fiscal years, not merely two, to prove ourselves fully,” Narvekar wrote. "Like everyone else, HMC will have good years and bad over that period. We will remain focused on the long-term performance, not on year-to-year performance."
University Treasurer and HMC Chairman Paul J. Finnegan ’75 wrote in an accompanying email that HMC’s board was “pleased” to see “solid portfolio performance” during the transition.
“As Board Chair of HMC, I knew first-hand the difficult work required to accomplish these goals within the prescribed five-year timeframe,” Finnegan wrote. “Narv and his team have now successfully completed the organizational restructuring with remarkable efficiency—more than a year ahead of schedule.”
Despite the challenges of the ongoing pandemic, Finnegan wrote that the board is “confident” HMC’s restructuring will ensure that the endowment maintains a “strong, long-term” performance.
“The endowment’s role has always been to provide a perpetual source of funding in support of the teaching and research mission of Harvard,” Finnegan wrote. “Year-to-year investment returns will always fluctuate, as is their nature, but we are confident that the changes made to HMC will help ensure strong long-term performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A form created by a Harvard senior and circulated online Monday invited members of the Class of 2021 to participate in a graduation trip to a tropical destination during the coronavirus pandemic.
The form stated that seniors should find an alternative to Commencement Exercises, which it speculated will not take place due to the public health crisis, to celebrate the conclusion of their college experience.
“Hi friends! The chances of having commencement in person look pretty slim, but let's have one last hurrah!” the form read.
It went on to pose a series of questions asking interested students to indicate their travel preferences. Destination options included Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, Cancún, or Los Cabos, while the activity offerings spanned live music, catamarans, “boozing,” salon amenities, and scuba diving.
The form stated that the trip is open to all Harvard students and encouraged undergraduates to invite their friends and “significant others,” citing less expensive rates for larger groups: “the bigger the block, the better the rates.”
The form also asked students to select their budget for the trip, ranging from less than $1,000 to more than $2,000.
The form — which was no longer accepting responses as of Tuesday night — did cite concerns about coronavirus, noting that the trip’s organizers take “COVID safety seriously.”
As of Tuesday, the world had recorded more than 100 million cases of Covid-19, including more than 419,000 deaths in the United States.
The form stated that all trip participants would receive Covid-19 tests before traveling and that they would travel to a resort that “adheres to high COVID safety standards,” including on-site testing.
“The agent booking the trip has handled trips for 70+ people in the midst of COVID without issue,” the form assured prospective travelers. “If the situation with COVID worsens and makes travel untenable, we will all have trip insurance for receiving full refunds or switching the dates.”
Respondents had the option to indicate the number of nights they would like to vacation, ranging from less than four to more than seven. The trip would take place during late May or early June.
The form’s apparent author, Alexis M. “Lexi” Mealey ’21, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.

Laurie A. Ferhani, a middle school science teacher at the Amigos School in Cambridge, has completely adapted her curriculum to an online format, using interactive online simulations to replace labs.
Due to the reduced class time remote learning provides, however, her students are only learning a third of what they would have in a typical year, Ferhani said.
“Where I am now, in January, I probably would have been in November," she said.
While all Cambridge Public School students began the year with remote learning from home, on Oct. 13, certain eligible students began attending in-person classes, including students enrolled in pre-K through first grade, certain second and third graders, and students in special education programs.
CPS followed three metrics in the fall to determine if schools could continue with in-person learning: the seven-day average of daily new cases in Cambridge, the Covid-19 test positivity rate in Cambridge, and the number of Covid-19 particles in sewage wastewater in the greater Boston area. If two of the metrics surpassed a certain threshold, schools shifted to remote learning until these metrics remained below their thresholds for a week.
CPS shifted to remote learning for all students on Dec. 10 after two metrics surpassed their thresholds. In-person learning for previously eligible students resumed on Jan. 11.
In response to parents’ complaints about the efficacy of online learning, the Cambridge School Committee passed two motions in a special meeting on Dec. 22, including reducing required social distancing measures and quarantine periods.
Eric Lind, a psychologist and parent to two daughters enrolled in CPS, was one of many parents who spoke during the meeting's public comment period about the mental distress remote learning caused for students.
“It was heartbreaking to see our oldest daughter — who used to be excited for school, would get up in the morning, would go early to see her friends and to visit her teachers — become sullen, bitter, withdrawn, and really disconnected from peers,” he said. “Our youngest daughter, a second grader, was fortunate enough to be able to go back to school and the difference in her mental health between my oldest daughter was telling.”
Students and educators agreed that remote learning has harmed students’ mental health and exacerbated inequities.
Ferhani said many students turn their cameras off while on Zoom because they feel “embarrassed.”
“You might see one person’s bedroom, and it’s all decked out with anything that you would ever want,” Ferhani said. “And then you see somebody — I had one kid take their class from a closet in their house because there were just so many people, and they didn’t want anyone to see where they were living.”
Robin Harris, the former principal of CPS's Fletcher Maynard Academy and a CPS administrator, shared feedback the district has received from families at a Curriculum and Achievement Sub-Committee Meeting on Jan. 12. From late November through December, CPS hosted nearly 20 sessions with families on remote learning and has surveyed families about their experiences on Zoom.
At the meeting, Harris reported that families of students attending in-person school generally felt safe with the health precautions taken by schools. At the same time, she said many families, especially families of color, said they would not enroll their children in person until the pandemic was better controlled or vaccines became readily available, she said.
Overall, Harris said, families find remote learning “ineffective.” She also said remote learning has taken a toll on students’ wellbeing.
“Students are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and fatigued by remote learning,” Harris said. “Many feel socially isolated and want additional opportunities for youth and teacher interactions.”
At the same meeting, Nuriel Vera-DeGraff, a junior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, said the remote setting has impaired the quality of his education.
“Class time has been significantly cut,” he said. “One of the biggest downsides is that teachers aren’t really having as much time to connect one-on-one with each student.”
Still, Vera-DeGraff said his teachers have tried to find ways to engage him and his classmates remotely.
“Teachers have gotten insanely creative in ways to connect with their students and have them participate even if it’s not with their cameras on,” he said.
Learning during Covid-19 has created challenges not only for students, but for educators too.
As students struggle through Zoom instruction, teachers also find it difficult to meaningfully connect with — and ultimately educate — their students when their Zoom cameras are off.
“I told them, we’re humans, we need to see two eyes, we need to see a smile, we need to see if you understand it,” Ferhani, the CPS middle school teacher, said.
Outside of the classroom, Ferhani and other teachers said they believe the school district has sidelined them from vital discussions about school operations during the public health crisis. They also said the school district has not adequately supported them and addressed their concerns.
Superintendent Kenneth N. Salim meets weekly with school principals. In addition, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said in an interview that the School Committee held two roundtables in the fall with principals, during which they received feedback from teachers. Teachers were also represented in the CPS Covid-19 Taskforce and in various working groups, she said.
In early January, however, the district stoked the ire of many educators when the School Committee proposed an expansion of in-person learning to begin as early as Feb. 8.
Ferhani said she was “upset” about the Feb. 8 expanded in-person plan, particularly with a three foot reduction in distancing requirements and a shift in the district’s metrics for positive cases.
“Right now we kind of feel like sacrificial lambs, where we have a different standard of safety than other workers do,” she said.
Lily Rayman-Read, a history teacher at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, sent an email on Jan. 8 to CPS affiliates in opposition to the proposed in-person expansion plan. Over 300 similar emails followed hers.
“Our needs, our concerns, and our very sound advice, have simply been ignored,” Rayman-Read wrote in the email. “We have begged for a seat at the table countless times, and been denied.”
The Educators of Colors Coalition, part of the Cambridge Educators Association union, stated the school reopening process “has caused harm and trust has been broken” in a Jan. 9 statement.
The Coalition recommended the district “abandon” its Feb. 8 expansion plan, and instead implement a community-created reopening plan centered on racial equity and physical safety.
Siddiqui, who serves as the chair of the Cambridge School Committee, said at the Jan. 19 School Committee meeting that she is “taking to heart” feedback she receives, and that she is “cognizant” of educators’ fears.
Though they agree remote instruction is not comparable to in-person learning, Cambridge families are nonetheless split on whether they want their children to return to the classroom.
About fifty-five percent of eligible students opted for in-person schooling in the fall, Salim said in a December interview. Data compiled by the Cambridge School Committee revealed that while 62 percent of eligible white students elected to learn in-person, only 47 percent of eligible African American students did.
Bernette J. Dawson and Amara E. Donovan, leaders of the Cambridge Families of Color Coalition and CPS parents, believe CPS did not engage “hard-to-reach” families enough and was not upfront about what in-person learning would look like.
People of color are more likely to live in multigenerational housing and have reduced access to healthcare, nutritious foods, and transportation, Donovan said. That inequality coupled with concern over whether policies like mask-wearing would be fairly enforced may explain why Black and Brown families were reluctant to send their children back to school, Donovan said.
Balancing the different interests of stakeholders in the school district’s reopening plans is a daunting task for Siddiqui and Salim. Public comment during School Committee meetings can last for almost three hours.
Salim said “no model is perfect in this context,” and that any plan for hybrid learning will have “trade-offs.”
On Jan. 20, the School Committee approved Salim’s recommendation for schools to delay their in-person expansion plan to March 1, instead of Feb. 8 as initially planned.
The new plan expands in-person learning and coronavirus testing for certain grades. A remote learning option will remain available to all students.
Preliminary data from an enrollment form sent to families revealed that while 57 percent of elementary school families request in-person learning, only 41 percent of upper school and 32 percent of high school families did.
On Friday, the Cambridge Educators Association voted to declare it had “no confidence” in Salim and the Cambridge School Committee. The vote came after the School Committee approved the superintendent’s March 1 reopening plan and one week after Salim announced that he would resign from his post at the end of the academic year, citing family considerations.
Salim and Siddiqui wrote they were “disappointed” by the union’s declaration in a letter sent to CPS affiliates.
“Unfortunately, this is a strategy of division we have seen unions employ in other school districts in Massachusetts during the pandemic,” they wrote. “Despite this action, our goal will continue to be expanding in-person learning opportunities for our scholars, while keeping all of our staff safe.”
Salim and Siddiqui wrote in the letter that the district has invested $5 million into school safety measures and that it remains committed to incorporating educators’ feedback.
“Ultimately, we have to decide what is best for the entire school district - even as we recognize that some people will disagree,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council faced censure in the past month for its poor handling of Wintersession funds, the dispersal of which students say was marred by delays and privacy failures.
Each year, between the fall and spring semesters, the UC solicits applications for its Wintersession funds — a pool of money it distributes to students in the form of winter internship stipends, grants for workplace attire, and more.
A December email addressed to students who had applied for the fund drew criticism after the sender failed to blind-copy applicants, a mistake students said violated first-generation, low-income students’ privacy. Those who were granted funds also voiced complaints about delayed disbursement, accompanied by lackluster communication from the UC finance committee.
Former Financial Chair Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 attributed the emailing error to a rocky hand-off between her and the incoming financial chair, Daniella M. Berrospi ’24.
Ganesh said she did not have adequate time to train Berrospi because Ganesh's mom was diagnosed with Covid-19.
“I think a lot of the complaints, the animosity is coming from people that don't understand,” Ganesh said. “[Berrospi is] working really hard, but she doesn’t know what to do yet… I wasn't able to kind of help her as much as I would have liked.”
Berrospi explained that she had to learn everything on her own when she stepped into the role — “a very individual process.”
Following her mistake, Berrospi said she fell into a “panicky situation” that she was not sure how to remedy. Around a month later, she sent an email apologizing to the applicants.
“As a first-generation low-income student myself, I understand how sensitive information that is supposed to remain confidential but is released on accident can cause harm and cross privacy lines,” Berrospi wrote.
Vivian Zhao ’24, a Wintersession fund applicant, said that she “personally wasn’t too affected” by Berrospi’s mistake. She said, however, that she knew of applicants who “did mind a lot.”
Zhao said she thought Berrospi’s apology was “satisfactory,” but urged the UC to be more careful in the future.
The email fumble was not the only factor that frustrated students, who complained about dispersal delays over social media. Though students said online they had expected to receive their grants over winter recess, funds are still being distributed after the start of the spring semester.
UC Treasurer Edwin B. “Eddie” Jin ’24, who is responsible for distributing the funds, acknowledged that the dispersal process was taking longer than recipients might have anticipated and admitted that the finance committee could have operated with greater transparency.
He said the delays arose because the services the UC traditionally uses to disperse money, such as Venmo, have limits on how much money can be sent in a given period of time.
“There's about a $5,000 cap on the amount of money that we can disperse through Venmo per week,” Jin said. “We prioritized using that money for the internship stipend, since that was the most urgent over Wintersession.”
Jin also said a preexisting $35,000 backlog in other UC grants exacerbated the situation.
Though Jin said Venmo is ideal for protecting student privacy, he said he thinks it would be worth identifying an alternative distribution method, such as PayPal, to avoid backlogging issues in the future.
In the meantime, Jin said he is working diligently to disperse the remaining Wintersession grants.
“We hope to have the vast majority of Wintersession grants done by next weekend,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Developer Samuels and Associates outlined detailed plans focusing on affordable housing and green spaces during a Tuesday meeting of the Harvard-Allston Task Force and Impact Advisory Group.
Tuesday's presentation enhanced previously proposed plans for a development located at 180 Western Ave. — known as Barry’s Corner — that will have 273 residential units, retail space, and restaurants.
The task force, which is made up of Allston residents and Harvard affiliates who work with the Boston Planning Development Agency to discuss the impacts and benefits of Allston projects, convenes reguarly to promote communication between the project developer, task force members, and Allston residents, according to the agency website.
Julia Wynyard, vice president of development at Samuels and Associates, discussed plans for unit size and affordability on Tuesday.
“With 273 units, 73 percent of those units would be larger than a studio, and 30 percent of those units would be two and three bedrooms,” Wynyard said.
Wynyard also said there are numerous factors that influence the affordability of the development units, and provided a rough breakdown of the income brackets that units would fall under.
“In terms of project affordability with the proposed 273 units, approximately 35 units would represent 13 percent at 70 percent [area median income],” she said. “Because this project would fall under a compact living, those affordable rents would actually have an additional 10 percent discount applied to them.”
According to Wynyard, the proposed compact living policy allows developers to create more units to satisfy people willing to “trade off” square footage for lower rent.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, a resident task force member, questioned whether there is demand for the compact living spaces like the ones proposed, though. D’Isidoro said he has seen the demand for larger living spaces increase during the pandemic.
Also at the meeting, David P. Manfredi, who is the CEO and founding principal of the architecture firm Elkus Manfredi, discussed how the 180 Western Ave. development would interface with the public.
Manfredi elaborated on plans for green space introduced at last month’s task force meeting and described a “network of open space” accessible to residents. The network would include space from “the recently-renovated Smith Field” to “the future Greenway.” Such spaces, per Manfredi, would serve not only as places to gather but also as access to the Charles River and Harvard's proposed Enterprise Research Campus.
Manfredi also said the development would transform an “underutilized” space that has been “unable to sustain” retail establishments, revitalizing it into a space similar to the Continuum development in Allston.
“We have the opportunity to make a really good edge on Western, on Harvard, and on Bertram,” Manfredi said. “Make it safe and secure, and try to make it as diverse in terms of its uses on the ground floor and as inclusive as possible in terms of not privatizing space.”
These "edges," according to Manfredi, would comprise “landscape,” “walking,” and “building apron” zones, whose sizes could be adjusted depending on demands for more private or public space.
But Edward A. Kotomori, one of the resident members of the task force, said he feared that new developments would push Allston residents out of the neighborhood.
“Don’t push us out,” Kotomori said. “This has been done for years.”
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email that the developer's proposal will in fact increase the amount of affordable housing in Allston, and pointed to previous residential units included in the Continuum project.
Manfredi also responded that he feels confident about the development landscape.
“I believe in cities, I certainly believe in Boston, I certainly believe in Cambridge,” he said. “They are fueled by an economy that is about being entrepreneurial.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company — the firm managing the University’s $41.9 billion endowment — may have bought Bitcoin as early as 2019 from market exchanges, per a Monday CoinDesk report.
Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that operates independently of central banks, exists only as a series of transactions on a series of servers known as “blockchains.”
When it started in 2009, bitcoin ranged in value from $5 to $20. But in the past four years, the price of a single bitcoin has spiked to more than $20,000 before falling back to around $16,000.
This is not the first time the University is reported to have invested in cryptocurrency. In April 2019, Harvard-affiliated investors purchased around $11.5 million worth of Blockstack cryptocurrencies, according to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Blockstack, which started as an open-source digital privacy project, launched its coin in 2018. It was one of the first cryptocurrencies to gain approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
HMC was reported to have 95.8 million stack tokens at Blockstack’s initial offering. At the time, the investment made up less than 0.05 percent of Harvard’s endowment, which was then valued at nearly $40 billion.
The Information, citing an anonymous source, reported in October 2018 that Harvard and several other universities invested in a cryptocurrency fund, though the report did not cite which type of digital currency.
Bitcoin’s value has more than quadrupled in the past year, but its success has not come without scrutiny. Over the past several years, the cryptocurrency has faced concerns in the United States and abroad about its potential use for illegal activities.
Bitcoin’s value dropped by as much as 10 percent on Tuesday morning, as investors await the Biden administration’s plans for the future of cryptocurrency and its markets.
Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, and Gary Gensler, the nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, have signaled that they would look closely into regulating Bitcoin.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment, citing HMC’s policy not to comment on individual investments.

For the first time in history, Harvard finds itself represented on the biggest stage in football for the second consecutive season. This weekend in Tampa, Cameron Brate ‘14 will suit up on his home field for the Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. While Brate is the sixth Crimson alum set to appear in a Super Bowl, Sunday will mark back-to-back years of representation in the game for Harvard football.
“It obviously is a great feeling to see those kids, how much they've developed, and the incredible character that they have shown to get to this level, the highest level on the planet,” Harvard Coach Tim Murphy said. “I’m just extraordinarily happy for these kids.”
Brate has been an essential part of the Buccaneers' offense, with future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady finding him for 11 catches, 149 yards, and one touchdown so far in the playoffs. His touchdown score proved to be the game-winner in the NFC Championship victory over the Green Bay Packers, earning Tampa Bay a spot in the Super Bowl at home.
Brate has already been a part of Harvard history in the NFL. In October 2017, Brate caught a touchdown pass from the then-Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05, connecting for the first-ever Harvard-to-Harvard touchdown pass in NFL history.
Brate, however, is not the only recent Crimson product to make his mark in the Harvard history books. Last season, Kyle Juszczyk ‘13 played for the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV. In the second quarter, Juszczyk took a 15-yard reception into the end zone for a touchdown, the first-ever Super Bowl score by a Harvard alum. Despite holding a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter, the Kansas City Chiefs rattled off a late 21 points in just over five minutes in order to defeat Juszczyk and the 49ers, winning a thrilling championship, 31-20.
“Those guys [make] good coaches,” said Coach Tim Murphy, who coached both Juszczyk and Brate at Harvard. “We did a good job on evaluating their character, their work ethic, their versatility, and, certainly, their resiliency, to be able to fight through whatever they had to and to get to the level they're at. I think it’s a sign of good recruiting and good evaluations, but at the end of the day, those guys make good coaches at any level.”
Now playing on the biggest stage at the next level, Brate will find himself in a similar situation as his former teammate the year before, facing off against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in this year's Super Bowl. The Chiefs once again dominated the league en route to their AFC title, and Brate and the Buccaneers — led by Tom Brady, the most successful postseason quarterback of all-time with different Massachusetts roots — will hope to dethrone the defending champions.
 While Juszczyk now plays fullback for the 49ers, the pair both played tight end together at Harvard, overlapping with each other in three of their four years in Cambridge. Both would star together in Harvard’s tight end-friendly offense. Juszczyk and Brate finished their careers third and fourth in career receiving touchdowns with 22 and 18 receiving touchdowns, respectively.
"We have two tight ends in the game at all times,” Coach Murphy said. “We probably rotate three or four throughout the game. They had that opportunity. And indeed, they had a responsibility that they had to play all the positions.”
In their senior seasons, the pair of tight ends both earned First-Team All-Ivy League honors, dominating the Ancient Eight as a pass-catching duo in their time at Harvard. In 2012, Harvard went 8-2 and finished second in the conference. After Juszczyk’s graduation, Brate helped lead the 2013 team to an impressive season, going 9-1 and capturing an Ivy League title.
“They weren't just a quote-unquote tight end, since they had to play tight end, they had to play fullback, they had to play wide receiver, they had to play bonding receiver, they had to play slot receiver,” said Coach Murphy, speaking to his tight ends’ versatility. “We let them know that upfront. In my first meeting with those guys, I tell them that the reality is, you're going to have to be really mentally sharp to play early. If you're not going to block, you're not going to play, but if you do, you're going to have a whole lot of fun because there's very few tight ends in the country that get to play the variety of positions that you're going to play in this particular offense.”
Juszcszyk specifically has made a name not only as a pass-catcher but as a blocker too. This year, the bruising fullback was named to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl.
Harvard has recently become a breeding ground for NFL tight ends. Of Harvard’s six players on NFL rosters at the start of the 2020 season, four played tight end for the Crimson. In addition to Juszczyk and Brate, Tyler Ott ‘14 of the Seattle Seahawks and Anthony Firkser ‘17 of the Tennessee Titans all played the position under Coach Murphy in the last decade. Firkser made history last season, scoring the first-ever postseason touchdown by a Harvard alum in a Wild Card victory over the New England Patriots.
“We've been very fortunate at the tight end position,” said Coach Murphy, who also coached the tight ends and halfbacks in Harvard’s offense. “Having guys like Kyle Juzsczyk, Cam Brate, Anthony Firkser, Tyler Ott, Ben Braunecker, all five of those guys were on NFL rosters five months ago, and I had the luxury and the good fortune of having them in my office for four or five years.”
Not only has Harvard served as a collegiate producer for NFL tight ends, but it has also led the pack in the FCS as a whole. Harvard’s six players on an NFL roster at the start of the 2020 season paced the Ivy League and was second in the FCS overall, trailing only James Madison.
“They were all obviously outstanding football players for us, even though they were not necessarily super highly recruited out of high school,” Coach Murphy explained. “But I think they all had that common trait of just tremendous character, not just in terms of being class kids, but being kids who had a great work ethic and who were extraordinarily coachable. Because of all of those things, they developed to the point where they were as good as anybody in the country at their positions, and that's where they're at now. It's a long climb for anybody in the FCS, and I’m just extraordinarily proud of those kids.”
The recent Harvard success in the NFL, highlighted by the back-to-back Super Bowl appearances by Juszczyk and Brate, has further shown the growth of the program and the Ivy League as a whole.
“We’ve had the extraordinarily good fortune to win a lot of football games in this century and eight championships this century, and all that does is motivates your competitors,” Coach Murphy explained. “As our competitors have done a lot of other things, whether it is facilities, whether it is recruiting, whether it's a combination thereof, whether it's coaching turnover. The league is more competitive than ever.”
Indeed, the Ivy League has performed at high levels in recent years, boasting nearly two dozen Ivy League grads on NFL rosters for the last several years. Harvard has led this charge thanks to its recent crop of talent.
“We've had 32 kids sign NFL contracts since we took the job in 1994,” Coach Murphy said. “All of a sudden, people have said ‘hey, we've got to keep up, we’ve got to find a way to compete,’ and the caliber of play in the Ivy League and the level of the student-athletes in the Ivy League in the sport of football has never been higher.”
As for Brate, he will hope to become just the third Harvard player to win the Super Bowl. John Dockery ‘66 of the New York Jets and Matt Birk ‘98 of the Baltimore Ravens are the only former Crimson to hoist the Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowls III and XLVII, respectively.
The Buccaneers are the first team to ever play the Super Bowl in their home stadium, and Brate and his Tampa Bay teammates will hope to lift the Lombardi Trophy at the center of their own field on Sunday night.

Shopping for Gen Ed classes this year was probably as satisfying as any other form of online shopping — there we were with seemingly limitless options, plenty of actual information sessions, and everyone vying for the most “gem-y” of all the gems. However, now that classes have actually started, we’re left facing the harsh reality of endless reading assignments. Will we actually end up reading all of them? Probably not. Will we still complain about them? Of course!
The Declaration of Independence
Even with their long list of grievances against England, the Founding Fathers managed to keep it under a cool 2,000 words, which is certainly much less than the 75,000 words that you might find in my Gen Ed reading.
The Walk to Annenberg When You Know The Dinner is Roast Beef
There are few walks as somber as the walk to the Berg when you know that roast beef is waiting for you. Maybe the thought of the thick, grey meat actually slows down the rate of walking. It always feels like a very long journey when you know there is a punishment waiting at your destination.
The Pause on Zoom When a Professor Asks a Question and Nobody Responds
Will someone answer? Is anybody going off of mute? Is the professor looking at me? Are they going to cold call? Should I just answer? Do I even know the answer? A million questions, and a crushing amount of awkwardness. The pause is infinitely long, but still shorter than my latest Gen Ed reading.
The Distance from My Dorm Room to the Closest Water Source
Sometimes, I choose to be ragingly parched rather than make the voyage to fill up my water bottle. It feels like quite the distance in the morning when you wake up and have to descend from the third floor to the first to get some warm, slightly odorous water from the fountain.
The Communist Manifesto
The Communists certainly seemed to be able to keep it concise. At a breezy 32 pages, I would be almost overjoyed to engage with their literature compared to my latest reading assignment.
My Gen Ed readings, for all their length, are here to stay. However, I’m hoping that an investment in Brita filters and Trader Joe’s food will at least eliminate the need for odorous water and unidentifiable meat — in any case, major props to those of you actually planning to complete these endless readings!
