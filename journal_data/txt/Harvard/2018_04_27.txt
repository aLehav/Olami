After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Capture the balance of this pose,” Heddi Siebel says as she walks around the room. “Get the back, get the weight.”
Students stand around the model, Callista Womick, in a semicircle, facing easels with charcoal in hand. They draw in silence, with eyes flickering back and forth between their page and Womick. Some of their drawings will be quick, completed in 30 seconds, and others will be developed over the course of an hour.
Hired by the Office for the Arts at Harvard, Siebel teaches this weekly class in Currier Treehouse, which is open to all Harvard students. With multiple degrees in printmaking and years of artistic teaching experience at several universities, Siebel is now in her third year teaching “Figure Drawing,” a class that has run for over 30 years. She welcomes students with varying degrees of drawing experience, and emphasizes the empathy evoked by figure drawing, particularly through studying the nude model.
Izzi Steinhaus ’18, an Applied Math concentrator, had no formal artistic background prior to college but has taken two visual arts classes through the Visual and Environmental Studies department. “These classes deeply challenged me to feel confident getting out of my comfort zone,” she says. “I had wanted to take a drawing class for a long time, and I had no experience with figure drawing, so this felt like a perfect opportunity to challenge myself and learn a lot.”
This desire to be challenged is essential to the class, according to Siebal. “I don’t want it to be competitive. It’s not art school,” she says. “But I do want it to be taken seriously. I throw the challenges out, and they can accept them or not.”
The class, then, is less about skill and more about observation. “I think it’s so vital and important for one human to be studying, looking, and perceiving another human because it eventually creates empathy,” Siebel says. “You’ll start to understand your own vulnerabilities by studying those of the model.”
Siebel believes that the students have more power because they are clothed, as opposed to the model. She often has her students pose with the model, one at a time, to understand the feeling of being in front of others and the vulnerability that comes with it. “I want them to bring that energy into their own drawing,” Seibel says.
She says the model’s nudity does not imply sexual undertones, however. “It’s a cliché that the relationship between the artist and model is sexual just because the model isn’t wearing clothes,” Siebal says. “You don’t want to reduce it to something that’s just about sexuality.”
According to Steinhaus, Siebel ensures that the class is always respectful to everyone in the room. For example, the dialogue between the students, instructor, and model during each session is limited and professional. To ensure the model is comfortable, Siebel asks, “I’m thinking about making this pose an hour. Do you think you can handle it?”
Because they have worked with each other for years, she and Womick sometimes joke during the studio sessions. When Womick is in a particularly difficult position for a 30-second pose, for example, Siebel says, “Want to hold that for an hour?”
“I wish I could,” Womick says with a laugh.
Womick, an artist herself, has been a professional model since 2014. Different models usually come in every week—“We have male figures, female figures, heavyset figures, thin figures,” Siebel says—but Womick is here for three consecutive weeks while students work on a series of three drawings, unified through medium, theme, or concept of choice.
Siebel sees drawing as having particular value in a fast-paced culture. “One of the biggest problems with contemporary culture is that we look so fast at things now that we don’t really see them,” Seibel says. Drawing, on the other hand, is about slowing everything down.
“We need more arts. More observation,” she says. “The more that you look and the more that you see and the more you connect with your surroundings, you appreciate things and people more.”

Although the Harvard College Stand Up Comic Society (HCSUCS) usually runs shows every week or so, the April 14 performance was not your run-of-the-mill show. The star comedians were not regular HCSUCS members, nor were they students at all. Instead, almost the entire show featured comedy sketches and routines by Harvard faculty. A personal project of over three months in the making, “Faculty Lounge” marks a bold new method of connection between professors, organizations, and the student body.
Joel Kwartler ’18, co-president of the HCSUCS, says that it took considerable time and effort to find faculty who were willing and able to participate. “I sent probably about 80 emails, I snuck around and found out where office hours were for high profile professors who kept them pretty secret,” he says. Many of the faculty he originally had in mind were unable to participate. “I don’t think anyone I ever took a class with is in the show.” However, “Faculty Lounge” has ended up with a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences.
The performance of the professors was remarkably professional, especially considering how brief a time they had to prepare a routine. Kwartler and the HCSUCS completed the training and rehearsal over the space of three weeks. Although HCSUCS members streamlined and supplemented the faculty’s act, the basic premises of the show were written by the professors and deans.  Kwartler, who has several years of experience in stand-up comedy, says “if I was doing a show with eight first time freshmen or eight professors, the professors will probably be the better show.”
HCSUCS hosted the show to raise money for Y2Y and HSHS, two organizations that run shelters in Cambridge to serve the homeless population. Jeon Jun Kim ’18, finance director for HSHS, says that both organizations have played a significant role in managing the logistics of the show. “I deal mainly with the administrative parts…booking the venue, selling tickets,” he says.
Nathan Cummings ’18, fundraising director for Y2Y and former Crimson editor, believes that “Faculty Lounge” serves as a powerful new tool for organizations like Y2Y and HSHS to reach out to students. “One of the goals we have for Y2Y is to move towards more student involvement in terms of fundraising, more grassroots projects like these, small donations, events, benefits.” At the same time, Cummings says, “It’s not just about fundraising in the end. It’s also about developing a great relationship with the student body.” Overall, their efforts seem to have been a success, as two thousand dollars have been donated to charity from ticket sales.
The idea of having Harvard faculty perform stand-up comedy has been a long time in coming. Kwartler acknowledges it as a personal project of his, an idea he conceived in November 2017. “I always wanted to do some sort of benefit performance… it occurred to me that if professors would perform in stand-up, people would probably pay some small amount to see that.”
Next spring, Kwartler began reaching out to professors at the very beginning of spring semester. “I had the lineup set…a week or two before spring break.” Concerning Kwartler’s role in “Faculty Lounge,” Cummings says, “This is really his baby. He’s put so much time and effort into this show. If this succeeds, it will be entirely on his merit.”
Will “Faculty Lounge” change the way students think of their professors? Kwartler hopes so. “This is the first time we’ve had this--since 1636,” says Kwartler. “I think there’ll be stories about personal lives, or unusual habits or observations that they’ve picked up, that just would not come up in class”
At the moment, it is uncertain whether the “Faculty Lounge” will become a mainstay of the stand-up comedy scene at Harvard. Kim states, “If this works out, I hope that whoever succeeds our role will continue to do this.”

When the members of the Norton committee were trying to elect the 2018 Charles Eliot Norton Professors of Poetry, Wim Wenders was probably one of the first names they had in mind. It’s not because he is a poet in the traditional sense of the word. The German filmmaker, who is considered to be one of the most influential figures in New German Cinema, arrived to Sanders Theater in Cambridge to give two lectures on April 2 and 9. Perhaps more than his predecessors—American documentarist Frederick Wiseman and French filmmaker Agnès Varda, who gave lectures in February—Wenders delved into the meaning behind the title “Professor of Poetry.”
Titled “The Visible and the Invisible,” the first lecture raised crucial questions about the cinematic medium in an attempt to capture its elusive nature. “What is it that you remember from a film you loved? What do you treasure?” Wenders asked. “The real existence of a film is diffused and tricky. So what exactly is a film? How and where do films exist?” He answered his own question only in his conclusion, claiming that movies exist somewhere in the imaginary space between the viewer and the filmmaker. “We are talking about co-ownership,” Wenders said later. “You are the rightful owners of films you want to hold on to. We filmmakers can show you the invisible only if you are willing to lift the veil. In films, there is always a space for you to enter.” The lights went out and the lecture ended, oddly enough, with another poet. The late Leonard Cohen appeared on a screen behind Wenders, singing the famed lined of his “Anthem,” “There is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.”
Wenders’ second lecture, “Poetry in Motion,” was centered around the poetic aspects of cinema. “Can poetry be expressed other than in words? Can images be poetic?” Wenders wondered at the beginning. The main focus of the lecture was Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu, to whom Wenders referred as “my great filmmaking hero.” Ozu, according to Wenders, was a true cinematic poet, as he prioritized lyricism over storytelling, incorporating in his films long, pensive shots that were not necessary for the advancement of the plot.
“For a long while, Wenders believed that the drive to sustain narratives had a way of diminishing, indeed denigrating images,” Eric Rentschler, the Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures, said.
“Story became a form of vampire, sucking the blood of images to gain its life and substance,” Rentschler, who gave the introduction to one of Wenders’ lecture, added. On stage, Wenders himself called filmmakers to release themselves from “the tyranny of story.”
According to Rentschler, Wenders’ cinema was, in a sense, a counter reaction to the Nazi regime in Germany. “As a young German filmmaker, Wenders was painfully aware of how sights and sounds had enabled the Nazi media dictatorship, how films of the Hitler regime had fostered mass manipulation, world war, and mass murder,” Rentschler said. “For that reason, his generation, the generation of Fassbinder and Herzog and the New German Cinema, had an unceasing distrust of German sights and sounds.”
Surprisingly, Wenders did not conclude his lecture with a reference to “Wings of Desire,” his 1987 fantasy film which is considered to be his signature movie but was barely mentioned in the lectures. Instead, he chose to screen an excerpt from his 2011 3D documentary film “Pina,” about the contemporary German choreographer Pina Bausch. “Poetry in motion was happening in front of my camera,” he said, referring to the invention of three-dimensional film as the tool that enabled him to shoot the film and do justice to Bausch’s art.
“As a poet and as a lover of words, I thought the questions that Wenders asked in the beginning were a beautiful way to frame his presentation. It was incredibly refreshing and thought-provoking,” Dajon A. Thomas ’19 said after Wenders’ final lecture. “There are many filmmakers who provide experiences that are all too familiar and at times mechanical, but there are others who express themselves and create with an effortlessness that flows through our bodies and leaves a mark. I definitely think Wenders is one of those and it was great to hear him speak.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every few months or so, the headlines of Hollywood-centric magazines are shaken by new revelations of unequal pay between a female actress and her co-star. Scandals such as Claire Foy of “The Crown” being paid less than her male counterpart, Matt Smith, almost lose some of their potency simply because of the familiarity of the narrative. However, the gender pay gap in the film industry is still an issue that is perhaps hard to sympathize with, given the multi-million dollar contracts that the women who speak up about it often earn.
The gender pay gap matters for reasons beyond what it means for the individual. It also matters beyond issues of representation: Sometimes the reason that women are paid less is because they play characters that are of secondary importance, precisely because predominantly male screenwriters wrote them that way. Another reason it matters is that the way we talk about Hollywood scandals mirrors the flawed structure of the arguments we make about gender inequality in the workplace on a daily basis.
Cases like Michelle Williams’, who was paid $1000 compared to her co-star Mark Walhberg, who got $1.5 million for the same film, undoubtedly demonstrate sexism in Hollywood extending beyond a mere calculation of what and who is profitable and into blatant discrimination. However, there are also cases where women are not being paid equally because their importance and potential are intrinsically considered inferior. Separate from the lack of female lead roles and the fact that too few films pass the Bechdel test, there is a tendency to regard the “hot sidekick” as replaceable—because she is. There is little investment in the potential star power and charisma of actresses that makes them profitable in the long run. After their youth starts to wane even a little bit, actresses are considered past their expiration date with a less successful and lucrative career path ahead of them.
A similar phenomenon happens outside of the film industry. There are numerous obstacles to women’s advancement up the professional ladder, and this immobility is one of the primary causes of the gender pay gap, but one of them in particular parallels those in the film industry. While their professional success depends on more than their physical appeal, women are not given the same opportunities for advancement if companies believe that the prospect of having children and taking some time off means the end of the women’s career at that place. The threat that disincentivizes investment in women’s careers is in this case not a younger actress’ “babyface” but a literal child. Obviously, this hurts the position of all women—those who cannot benefit from paid maternity leave, but also those who suffer from the expectation that they will need to, even if they themselves do not intend to have children. However, just as Keira Knightley has merits beyond what she could demonstrate in “Pirates of the Caribbean,” women who are systematically passed on from the audition for their “Pride and Prejudice”  can never realize their potential.
Another frequent argument surrounding the pay gap is that actresses, for some mysterious reason, perpetually fail to negotiate higher wages for themselves. This is exactly the same argument many make about why women outside the film industry do not “win” higher salaries for themselves. The underlying mechanisms for poor negotiation outcomes have certainly been hinted at, as by Jennifer Lawrence, who has spoken about the fear of being perceived as difficult. These reasons, and potential retaliations for creating such an image of oneself, certainly extend even more severely to cases where women are in a position of much less power than Lawrence.
However, on closer inspection, the case of women’s pay in Hollywood actually discredits the primary version of the argument, rather than just providing (plenty of) anecdotal evidence. Namely, many of these actresses hire professionals who do the work of negotiating for them. Certainly they are involved in the process, but they are represented by someone whose job is to get the best outcome for their client. If they fail too, in the (too rare) cases where actresses are arguably appearing in roles equally important as their male counterparts’, it cannot be because they are systematically not good enough at their job, but because the game is rigged against them. This has serious repercussions for all those who cannot think to hire someone to negotiate for them.
Unfortunately, even the arguments some make for how the industry has and should improve are far from perfect. Many point to cases such as Patty Jenkins’ as indicators of change. Patty Jenkins getting paid more than $7 million, however, more closely mimics the success of Sheryl Sandberg than it does announce a radical change in the position of women in the film industry. Very definitively, Sandberg becoming COO of Facebook did not solve the issue of gender inequality in the workplace.
Hollywood can be thought to operate on precedent and once the risk of failure (and it is most definitely a risk-averse industry) is reduced, more movies such as “Wonder Woman” will be produced. However, just as there is only one position of CEO and only one Facebook, there’s a limit to the extent of change that is going to be produced among those employed on films that are not major blockbusters with $149 million budgets.

As inconsistent as “Robbin’ Season” has been so far, it has a few gems that make its pitfalls worth trudging through. “Woods” is one such gem, though Alfred (Brian Tyree Henry), who the episode centers on, would likely disagree. The episode opens on the anniversary of Al’s mother’s death, which is never explicitly stated but which can be inferred from Earn’s inadequate concern for his cousin, Al’s particularly poignant laziness, and the hallucination he has of his mother cleaning up his home. “You know good and well I did not raise a son this lazy,” she chastises in the way only a parent could. “Get on up now. It’s close to noon,” she hums, blurred in the background, before disappearing as the room’s sunlight dims.
The hallucination makes sense both in and out of the context of the show. Brian Tyree Henry’s mother, Willow Kearse-Rice, passed away in 2016 and is the woman the episode is dedicated. Henry certainly uses his grief to emote Al’s reticence throughout the day. His mother’s absence sets Alfred off on a journey of self-discovery, a cliché but necessary plot device the stagnating show desperately needs to keep it moving forward. To anyone else, sans hallucination, Al’s day starts off well enough: He goes shopping, gets his feet massaged, and spends the first part of his day with his not-girlfriend Sierra. Unfortunately for Al, who just wants to keep things real, Sierra’s social-climbing antics make it nearly impossible. In the store, she pushes Al to change his image—”People gonna get tired of seeing a sweaty nigga in a polo and cargo shorts. Nobody wants somebody famous to look just like them.” At the nail salon, she takes a photo of herself and Al without his permission to post it on Instagram in the hopes of boosting both their profiles. But Al, whose tough act belies his desperation for normalcy, has finally had enough. “Look, I ain’t got to stop being me, all right? That’s something boring-ass people like your ass got to do,” he fumes, before walking out barefoot, off to God knows where to stay grounded in himself.
But during “Robbin’ Season,” staying grounded isn’t always the best move. Al encounters three teenagers who seem innocent enough, until they realize he’s alone. The boys initially act like the starstruck fans Al has grown used to—”When I tell my brother about this, he gonna trip,” one says—before turning against him. “You alone? You ain’t got no car?” one asks. “Aw, you keeping it real,” a teen croons, before they attack. Looks like in “Atlanta,” keeping it real doesn’t just mean not having money or ceding to the pressures of fame; it means making yourself completely vulnerable to the danger inherent in “Robbin’ Season.” As the boys beat and pull a gun on Al, successfully stealing his watch and gold chain, Al escapes into the woods where he either further hallucinates or loses himself within the depths of the forest.
Not for the first time, director Hiro Murai plays with the camera to evoke his character’s psyche: In this episode, the unconventional camerawork echoes Al’s off-kilter subconscious. Al is miniscule, fully immersed in the grandeur of the woods. The camera lens flares as the sounds of nature become the episode’s soundtrack. And hours later, when it’s dark and he has only just realized he has been walking around in circles, yet another stranger stalks him and threatens to hurt him. Somewhere, somehow in the darkness and while potentially facing death, everything clicks for Alfred. When he finally emerges from the woods, he takes a picture with a (white) boy in a gas station. “Got to give, like, a mob face, man,” he encourages, embracing what he has been running from all season. At last, Al understands what it means to be Paper Boi, and steps up to the challenge. Will Earn?
Deer Guts:
- I’d like to think the man in the woods was not a hallucination of Al’s, but then I’d never go into any forest every again, so maybe not.
- Sierra might be the show’s most annoying character, but for what it’s worth, I don’t think her hunger for money is the result of anything less than justified frustration at the systematic exclusion she experiences trying to make it big. Plus, her purple hair looks great.
- I love Darius, but he crossed a line this episode. Who cooks pasta with their feet?

Hulu’s long-anticipated Margaret Atwood adaptation isn’t afraid of going off the script in its second season. Entitled “June,” the first episode of “The Handmaid’s Tale”’s return starts off with a public hanging, in which all the handmaids are muzzled, herded by dogs and men, and forced into nooses in a dilapidated Fenway Park. All the while, Kate Bush’s “This Woman’s Work” vocalizes rather unfittingly (given the show’s typical somber anxiety) in the background. It’s unlikely that the show would kill off its heroine in the first episode, so this scene is pure clickbait. But look past the misstep and give the first episode a chance. The melodramatic hook does not do “June” justice.
As evidenced by Season One’s popularity, both Atwood and Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” find their power in subtlety and restraint, the tension between normalcy and horror. Atwood writes monstrosities with an eerie calmness, detailing how the handmaids are reproductive machines for her dystopian society’s powerful families. Her prose is mediated by the snarky comments of the story’s protagonist, Offred, or June (played by Elisabeth Moss in the TV series). Likewise, the Hulu adaptation mirrors the book’s tone with muted colors and filtered lighting, its confined state only punctuated by June’s narration. Her voice is first heard after it’s revealed that the public hanging was just a set-up, a cheap scare tactic (for both the handmaids and the show’s viewers). “Our father, who art in heaven. Seriously?” she asks. The show cuts to the title card. “What the actual fuck?”
But even after the tacky first scene, “The Handmaid’s Tale” quickly remembers how to captivate an audience using the same method as before. While the show spends a little too long focusing on Aunt Lydia’s (Ann Dowd) joy over the news of June’s pregnancy (it’s nearly impossible to sympathize with a woman who thrives on torturing others), the show finds its grounding in focusing on the handmaids—the women who dared to revolt in the last season’s finale. One by one, each handmaid has her hands burned by a kitchen stove, as the others wait their turn in line. In between them is June, who is forced to eat soup at a cafeteria table under their watchful eyes. Not much is said, but everything is implied: the resentment the other handmaids must feel toward June, who evades punishment because of her pregnancy; the potential split in the budding camaraderie that saved Janine (Madeline Brewer) from being stoned; the loss of the little power they thought they had in the Republic of Gilead. The subtlety somehow heightens the stakes, while the process of piecing together the full implications lengthens the horror.
There are other quieter moments that also have hefty impacts. Touch seems to be a relevant theme in “June,” particularly platonic kisses. Gilead is essentially devoid of unregulated contact, so it’s startling when Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski), the woman who plans to take June’s baby as her own, kisses June on the forehead after a long history of emotional and physical cruelty. “God bless you,” she says. There’s a brief moment of affection in that sterilized hospital room, making Serena Joy sympathetic for just a second.
But Serena Joy’s small appreciative gesture is nothing in comparison to June’s momentous one. June (potentially) escapes her life as a handmaid by stowing away in a butcher’s truck after following pieces of red tape to freedom, possibly left behind by the doctor who addresses June by her real name. After she is let out of the truck by yet another kind person, she hugs him, and kisses him on the cheek. It’s shocking—handmaids have no power in Gilead. June isn’t allowed to have physical or emotional connection to anyone, not even her fellow handmaids (earlier, June tried to hold another’s hand at the public hanging, but was forcibly torn away).
But June breaches that boundary, and does so again when she strikes a match and lights her old uniform on fire. It feels like a breath of fresh air, not just for June, but for the narrative itself. It’s a new season, and the writers behind “The Handmaid’s Tale” may be picking up on the fact that it’s time to leave Gilead behind and carve a new path on new territory. World-building and world-expansion are tricky things, but subtlety is key. If the writers can maintain the same quiet, deft hand that made the first season so provocative and not devolve into theatrics like they did with the opening spectacle of “June,” they won’t have any trouble keeping the first episode’s fire alive in the rest of Season Two.

If I ever become a “man of note,” my columns might come back to haunt me like a tricky spirit back from the dead—not to punish me, but to annoy me.
My opinions will likely change over the years, but those that I hold now as a strapping young undergraduate will remain immortalized on these pages. If a critic—or aspiring young journalist—ever digs up old columns of mine, they might find some lines I might not be as proud of ten, twenty, thirty years out.
Were this hypothetical ever to become reality, I would not be alone. There’s been a number of powerful Harvard College graduates who’ve gone on to become influencers in their respective field. And yes, articles they wrote as mere teenagers or people in their early twenties are still available for all to see.
“In a love affair, love will naturally grow, unmanaged and unfettered,” a former Crimson columnist wrote in the late 1990s. “If it stops growing, the affair falls apart, violently and wrenchingly. But we live to love again, our world having been enriched by all of our past affairs. It is spontaneous, and it is unmatched in human life.”
It’s tempting to assume the writer, who sounds like an aspiring Neruda, has taken up poetry full-time. Perhaps, after hours, he has. But as a day job, he works on legislation on the Hill. Our love-struck writer is none other than Republican Senator Thomas B. Cotton '98 of Arkansas.
Senator Cotton, who is now a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump’s xenophobic policies and co-sponsor of a nativist overhaul of U.S. immigration law, once dabbled in less pressing matters. Before he went about figuring out new ways of ripping immigrant families apart, he wrote about love life at Harvard.
Another Crimson columnist received a speeding ticket while driving his friend’s new Mercedes-Benz in 2002. “The larger reason I was speeding—well, that’s somewhat more embarrassing. You see, while I held the hammer down,” he confessed. “I was grooving to the exciting, pulse-pounding, adrenaline-boosting music of none other than. . . Garth Brooks.”
From there, he used Garth Brooks to reflect on diversity at Harvard, the tastes we value, and perceptions of mythologized middle America. The man who asked the difficult questions—including “But honestly, who sings along to Radiohead? Heck, who even knows what a Radiohead song is about?”—now holds one of the most powerful positions in journalism.
Ross Douthat has been a columnist for the New York Times since 2009. He’s become the poster child of conservative intellectualism and one of the most noted conservative voices in media. Yet while at Harvard, he dabbled in less intense conversations, writing about how “country music is tacky and sappy and simplistic and sung in a Southern accent.”
People continue developing their worldviews after they graduate. Often, they become more conservative as they get older. College is but a step in that transformation. But for those of us who write about the things that matter—or partake in activism or other forms of social change—pieces of this transformation are frozen in time.
Cruel, opportunistic readers could take a single phrase or position from old pieces to make a point about who the person is in the present. But given how drastically people’s politics can change in the span of a few years, holding people to specific policy positions they took in the past feels disingenuous. At the very best, it is an act of bad faith.
Simultaneously, individuals’ bodies of work as a whole do offer an insight into their worldview, which is much more static. Individual policy stances may change, but the fundamental way people view the world is harder to overhaul. Precisely because of that, the collection of an individual’s thoughts—written years before—are worth scrutiny as a whole.
Senator Cotton’s tirades against diversity and affirmative action at Harvard, his revelry in being deemed contrarian, and his criticisms of student activists formed the basis for the man now deemed by some as “the future of Trumpism.” Douthat’s writing while at Harvard primed him for an uncommonly quick ascent into journalism, with one writer noting that, “Instead [Douthat] became a Crimson columnist and worked for The Atlantic. That was smart.”
The particular details of an old opinion piece, or the particular way a sentence is phrased, are not all that important. The way these pieces inform a larger ideology, though, is critical, especially when the writers go on to inhabit spaces of extreme influence. It’s interesting—but not essential—to know that presidential advisor Stephen Miller once attacked Maya Angelou’s work “as tired, multicultural clichés.” It is essential to parse out how that particular opinion and his subsequent work informed him as a leading architect of the Muslim ban.
A standalone combination of words, written decades ago, are not worth over analyzing. The way they inform a larger ideology, though, should be fair game. My columns may be dug up in the future for their silliness, unfortunate phrasing, or a particular opinion that has aged badly. But the columns that haunt me should be those that explain any harm I might be inflicting on others in that point in my life—as a policy maker, writer, or person deemed worth listening to.
Ruben E. Reyes Jr. ’19, a former Crimson Editorial Chair, is a History & Literature concentrator in Leverett House. His column appears on alternate Fridays.

One of the most controversial topics at Harvard is social life. It is evident from the passions ignited that this is an issue about which many care deeply. However, the debate has largely centered around the College’s unrecognized single-gender social organizations—whose membership includes only a small fraction of students. Whether they are eliminated or tolerated, they will only ever directly affect a relatively small portion of the student body. Housing, however, affects nearly all undergraduates. It deserves much more attention than it has received, and there are steps the College should take to change it.
At its best, House and residential life can be a foundation for much of our undergraduate experience. However, it is not a system whose benefits are distributed equally among the students. The housing experience is far more negative for many of the of undergraduates who get randomly housed in the Quad, which comprises a quarter of the upperclass Houses. Some people truly love the Quad, and those who do not have the opportunity to apply for an interhouse transfer. To do that, however, many have to make the difficult choice between a blocking group and a River House. Even then, many of those applying to transfer will not be successful.
For a school that focuses so much on equality and fairness, especially with regard to social life—after all, exclusivity has been the lens through which the College has scrutinized the unrecognized single-gender social groups—there is a glaring absence of either in the housing lottery. Its random nature does not make up for that. It is fundamentally unfair that significantly worse housing options cost the same as significantly better ones, with no student choice involved. One might read what I’ve just written and argue that there is inequality among the River Houses too, and there is. But the minor inconvenience created by living in Dunster or Mather compared to Adams or Quincy, or the difference in newness—which will soon be gone—between the renovated and not yet renovated River Houses, pale in comparison to the headache of having to schedule your life around infrequent and often unreliable shuttles, losing the ability to go to your room between classes, and being often unable to eat in your own dining hall for lunch.
My proposed solution to this is quite simple: Redesign the housing lottery such that all sophomores live in the Quad and leave the randomization among the river houses for the two upper classes. This system is, of course, not without its own flaws, such as possibly creating distance between sophomores and older students, but its benefits outweigh those and any other drawbacks. This system would be infinitely more fair and equal for everyone involved, and it also could allow students more time to create or amend their blocking groups before settling into one for their final two years.
Such a system is by no means perfect, but it’s a very straightforward fix for a problem that affects many more students than some of the other issues that get  more of the College’s attention. This would be far more equitable, and it would create another collective experience shared by all Harvard students, similar to living in the Yard as freshmen. Moreover, it would also give students more time to form blocking groups, another cornerstone of Harvard social life. Even if this is not the best system, improving the student experience requires admitting that there may be better systems out there than the one we have now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past year came with many new prospects for public service opportunities at the College, especially in the wake of the generous Chan Zuckerberg Initiative donation. Notably, the Phillips Brooks House Association has convened a committee of students, the “Seamless Service Pathways Process,” aimed at creating a new initiative focused on making public service options more visible to students. The committee hopes to remove barriers for low-income students that prevent them from participating in public service both during their time at the College and after.
We appreciate all these efforts because public service is largely overlooked at the College. A major factor contributing to the growing pipeline that many of our peers have taken to jobs in management consulting or finance is the plethora of resources available to navigate those fields, including the disproportionate attention provided to those fields by the Office for Career Services and the various on-campus interviews that many firms grant students. There are few similar programs for public-service related career fields. This, combined with structural issues including for-profit careers’ high salaries and job security, explains why the job search for graduating seniors is tilted heavily towards the private sector.
There is a stigma around pursuing public service here at the College that must be removed. We should use our power and privilege as Harvard students to make a positive impact in the world. Since this PBHA program is in its infancy, there are several suggestions we hope the committee takes into account. We hope that the program features a variety of structural and guiding resources that can put public service opportunities on par with private sector—including guidance counselors, outreach programs, and career fairs that expose students to public service work opportunities. PBHA should also consider hosting speakers who could discuss their experiences in public service. To that end, the committee should also consider specifically hosting events that help de-stigmatize public service and focus on direct-service careers.
At the same time, this initiative comes as Gene A. Corbin, the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Public Service at the College, steps down after years occupying that position and helping implement the new committee. We appreciate his efforts in starting this program, and hope that this transition in his office will not disrupt this fledgling program and its potential. We expect that his successor is equally dedicated to changing the culture of public service here at the College.

UPDATED: April 27, 2018 at 1:42 a.m.
Harvard continued to reduce trash production per capita and water use in 2017, bringing the University closer to reaching its sustainability goals, according the 2017 Sustainability Report released Wednesday.
The report—which detailed the University’s progress toward its Sustainability Plan benchmarks set in 2014 for completion by 2020—shows that Harvard has reduced its trash production per capita by 44 percent from a 2006 baseline, a 1 percent improvement over the past year. The school has reduced its water use by 26 percent compared with the baseline, a 2 percent reduction in use over the past year.
Carbon emissions held steady in 2017 at the 30 percent reduction achieved last year over the total time period of the campaign. This overall reduction has continued despite an increase in campus square footage and the addition of spaces that consume significant energy like laboratories.
Heather A. Henriksen, director of the Office for Sustainability, wrote in a letter announcing  the report that cross-disciplinary work is necessary to address global climate concerns and that the University’s “One Harvard” campaign is conducive to this goal.
“Harvard is perfectly positioned to contribute to in helping to define a path forward, not only through our cutting-edge research but also by using our campus as a living lab for testing promising new solutions that will build stronger, more resilient communities,” she wrote.
This year’s report features new graphic tools, which form part of an effort to allow University affiliates to track progress and to make data sets available for study and benchmarking, according to Henriksen.
“To strengthen our commitment to transparency, evaluation, and accountability we have added new interactive charts to this year’s Report which are aggregated in an exciting new online data dashboard that will allow you to view our progress in more detail,” Henriksen wrote.
One graphic specifically shows that, while campus housing accounts for 31 percent of campus space, residential buildings use only 16 percent of total energy. Labs, by contrast, account for 22 percent of building space and use nearly half of all energy consumed on campus.
Other graphics show that public transit and walking are the most common commuter methods for Harvard affiliates, and that the University has seen a decrease in the number of campus vehicles running on gas.
In addition to these measures, in 2017 Harvard's Chief Information Officer Council approved sustainability standards for information technology that apply across the University.
Beyond efficiency and waste reduction, the sustainability initiatives aim to integrate study of climate change into the University’s curriculums. All 900 first-year students at the Business School examined how climate change would impact business for the first time in 2017, according to the report, and some first-year students in Harvard’s new Master in Design Engineering program focused on sustainability projects.
University President Drew G. Faust introduced the University’s new Climate Action Plan in February, including plans for the University to become fossil fuel-neutral by 2026.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 27, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the University earned a federal Chief Information Officer Council designation for sustainable information technology practices in 2017. In fact, in 2017 Harvard's Chief Information Officer Council approved sustainability standards for information technology that apply across the University.

Author and Pulitzer Prize-winner Colson Whitehead ’91 received the 2018 Harvard Arts Medal from University President Drew G. Faust at a ceremony in Sanders Theater Thursday afternoon.
At the celebration, Faust described the medal—established in 1995—as “Harvard’s highest honor for artistic achievement by alumni.” Whitehead is the third novelist to win the award, following past recipients Margaret Atwood and John Updike ’54. As she presented the medal to Whitehead, Faust said the University is “grateful beyond words that your words are in our library."
Whitehead limited his acceptance speech to just a few sentences, explaining that, during his days as a Harvard student, he never would have expected such an honor.
“I accept this on behalf of the fourth floor of Pennypacker. May you all live in peace and harmony,” he said.
Whitehead’s novel “The Underground Railroad” won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and was a #1 New York Times Bestseller. The novel is currently being adapted to an Amazon Studios television series written and directed by Barry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning writer-director of “Moonlight.”
In an hour-long interview with actor John Lithgow ’67—winner of last year’s Arts Medal—Whitehead discussed a range of topics including his writing career, his process as a writer, and the motivations for his work.
“Usually my books have too many black people to get picked up for live Hollywood,” Whitehead said with a chuckle.
Whitehead also spoke about his career transition—from working as a journalist early on to ultimately becoming a novelist.
“It was always about fiction,” he said, “When I was writing, one article would buy me four days of writing, that’s how I thought of it.”
Whitehead previously taught at Harvard as part of the “Black Writers Reading” series hosted by the W.E.B. DuBois institute in 2003.
This year’s ceremony opened with a poem reading by Amanda Gorman ’20, the first National Youth Poet Laureate. Gorman's poem outlined her experience rediscovering her African ancestry and roots.
The award ceremony marked the official start of this spring’s Arts First, an annual weekend festival on campus that showcases artworks and performances by University affiliates. Originally a festival limited to undergraduate art, the event has since expanded to include all University affiliates—including faculty and staff—as well as guest artists.
“This is the 26th year of the Arts First festival. It’s a four day celebration of creativity and art-making across the University,” said Marin J. Orlosky Randow ’07-’08, the Arts First coordinator at the University’s Office for the Arts.
Randow said this is the first year that Arts First—which will run from Thursday to Sunday—will hold events across the river in Allston. Among these events and exhibitions, the Office for Arts is sponsoring a performance of Antigone at the Harvard Stadium Sunday evening.
Randow said the Office for the Arts also seeks to encourage independent student artists, in addition to organized groups, to bring their work to the festival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bill Gates, Harvard’s wealthiest drop-out, returned to the University Thursday to visit labs and speak to hundreds of students from across Harvard’s schools about his career at Microsoft and philanthropy  via the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
At one point during his visit, Gates sat down with Francis J. Doyle III, the dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, to hold a public conversation before answering questions from the hundreds-strong audience. The conversation and question-and-answer session were both hosted by the Offices of the President and Provost.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 introduced Gates and Doyle, calling Gates his “college classmate.”
Gates, who was on track to graduate with the College’s Class of ’77, wrote in an email after the event that it was great to receive the invite to visit.
“It was really interesting to hear what was on students’ minds during my Q&A with them,” he wrote. “We live in an exciting time with so much opportunity for people who love learning and want to contribute to the world in some way, and I’m sure Harvard students will continue to make a big impact.”
Gates took questions from students in the crowd about a variety of topics, many related to inequities in the education system, which he called the most significant issue facing the country.
During the event, Gates mentioned some of his Foundation's efforts to bridge the gap in access to education. He particularly mentioned the Gates Millennium Scholars Program, which grants students from low-income minority backgrounds the opportunity to pursue an undergraduate education in any discipline.
Despite this and other initiatives, Gates said the Foundation—which he said spends $800 million annually on education—has not been able to move the United States education system into the top three globally ranked systems.
“We have no noticeable impact after almost 20 years of working in that space,” Gates said. “But we’re committed.”
For higher education, the problem goes deeper than funding, Gates said. Asked about the lack of “scientific literacy” in Washington, Gates said the issue extends beyond politicians, calling understanding of issues like  genetically modified organisms and climate change “very limited” among the general public.
“The problem is when you get issues—climate change being the best example—where scientific understanding is fairly important because the sacrifices have to be made now in order to get the benefit later,” he said.
Apart from education, Gates also discussed the Foundation’s other main priority: global health.
“The statistic that I’d be most proud of is when we got started, there were 11 million children a year under the age of five who died every year and now that number has been cut in half,” he said.
Gates said he attributes the decline in early childhood death to the Foundation’s efforts to provide vaccines and medications to Africa and other parts of the world. The Foundation is on track to reduce the number of deaths to 2.5 million by 2030, according to Gates.
The next challenge for the Gates Foundation is to fully eradicate polio, he said, noting the global effort is “very close” to achieving this.
Heather M. Viola, a student at the School of Public Health who attended the event and will intern for the Foundation this summer, said she is “very excited” Gates brought up the polio initiative.
“I was hoping to have a little bit more detail on the technical side of some of the global health and things specific to disease eradication, but I think I’ll have to wait and hear more over the summer when I start work,” she said.
Apart from discussing his work, Gates joked about his time as an undergraduate, expressing a wish that he had been “more sociable.” Gates laughed about how classmate and eventual Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer punched him for the Fox Club, one of Harvard’s all-male final clubs, to bolster his social life.
“There were these things called ‘men’s clubs’ and I never even would’ve known they existed, but Steve Ballmer decided I needed to have some exposure to, I guess, drinking. So he got me punched for the Fox Club so I’d go to those events,” Gates said.
On a more academic note, Gates discussed his experience with “Math 55,” a course he called the “hardest freshman math class at the time.” Gates assumed the class was no longer in existence.
“It is,” the audience resoundingly informed him.
Gates wrote in the email that, while much has stayed the same from his time as a student, some things have changed a lot.
“Access to information is a big thing—I used to stay up late and argue with my friends about some piece of information, and there was no way of proving who was right and who was wrong until the library opened up in the morning and we could research it,” Gates wrote. “Now, you can find the information online in an instant.”
Javier Cuan-Martinez ’18 said it was “surreal” to go from class to getting to see Gates speak.
“It was awesome to learn from him even if it was just for an hour and just seeing what his thoughts are on current events,” Cuan-Martinez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 1, 2018 at 6:11 p.m.
Some graduate students at Harvard Medical School say they feel wary of Harvard's newly formed union, with at least a few in Longwood—the location of the Medical School campus—expressing a desire to be excluded from the bargaining unit.
Fifty-six percent of eligible student assistants voted on April 18 and 19 to authorize Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers to collectively bargain with Harvard on their behalf. National Labor Relations Board officials certified the tally on April 20, counting 1,931 ballots in favor of unionization and 1,523 against.
Exit polling conducted by The Crimson suggested medical students were significantly less likely to vote in favor of unionization than were students attending other University schools.
The data, which was not adjusted for response bias, indicated that 61.5 percent of medical students voted against unionization, marking one of the highest percentages of "No" voters at any of Harvard's schools. By contrast, 66.4 percent of respondents from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences—representing the largest bloc of eligible voters—indicated they cast ballots in favor of the union.
After the election, some experts noted the size of Harvard’s union is unique among student unions at private universities—the proposed bargaining unit at Harvard includes over 5,000 students. By comparison, the graduate union at New York University—which is the only graduate student union at a private university that has successfully negotiated a contract to date—does not include research assistants from its medical school.
Medical Sciences Ph.D. student John L. Pulice III ’15 said he thinks a proposal to redefine the bargaining unit would gain significant support among students.
“At the medical school, people who are opposed to the union have been the most vocal,” he said. “I have heard many people even after the vote wondering if there is anything we can do to mitigate the effects of this. There’s a lot of frustration and maybe confusion.”
Medical Sciences Ph.D. student Noah Bloch, a vocal opponent of unionization, wrote in an email he would welcome an effort to exclude Longwood from negotiations.
“I certainly plan on being involved in this process once someone can figure out how to get it started,” he wrote.
Experts, though, say this type of split would not be immediately feasible. Former National Labor Relations Board Chairman William B. Gould IV said Wednesday the bargaining block cannot be changed at this point in the unionization process.
Issues relating to “the scope of the unit” cannot be raised for at least a year after the election results are announced, Gould said.
"Even then, beyond those factors, they would have to show that there’s something very different about their situation that would make them a skilled craft homogenous group of people that are separate and apart from the others,” he said.
Some Medical School students expressed support for the union.
Union organizer Hector F. Medina-Abarca, a Systems Biology Ph.D. student, said he disagrees with the notion that Longwood and Medical School students broadly oppose the union.
“The students [I have] talked to are very happy about the election result,” Medina wrote in an email. “Here in SysBio, I’d say students are excited about the next steps."
“As far as student engagement, the change from the election in 2016 is palpable in SysBio alone: we had [more than three] volunteers/organizers this round and no anti-union activity, whereas the previous election only I was helping with the unionization movement and there were a couple students here speaking out against the union,” Medina added.
Union organizer and Medical Sciences Ph.D. student Madeleine F. Jennewein wrote in an email that there are good reasons her classmates should support the union.
“I think there is a misconception that the things Humanities students need are more acute,” she wrote. “The benefits of a union—increased wages, better healthcare, benefits for student parents, and more support for diverse students—will accrue to everyone, regardless of their affiliation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For decades, the Harvard Mountaineering Club and Harvard Outing Club have called Adams House home, using their secluded offices in Claverly Hall as jumping-off points for adventures near and far.
Soon, that will change.
Adams is next up as part of the the College’s $1 billion House Renewal project—construction will begin starting June 2019—meaning the two student groups will lose their long-established Adams offices.
Leaders of the Outing and Mountaineering Clubs said that, though their current spaces carry significant sentimental value, the groups are open to working with the College to execute a seamless move. Nonetheless, the leaders remain concerned about certain aspects of the relocation.
Sheila C. Thimba, the College’s dean for administration and finance, wrote in an emailed statement that administrators are working with the groups to help find new spaces to fit their needs.
“This project will result in increased communal spaces, mid-block connections between buildings, and increased accessibility, all while maintaining Adams' many unique characteristics and charm,” she wrote. “As part of the process we have held numerous meetings with student groups to discuss options for new locations, and will continue to do so.”
The Mountaineering Club maintains a library, storage room, and an office space in Claverly Hall. The office, replete with couches, bookshelves, and pictures from climbing trips, serves as a reminder of the organization’s storied past, according to its leaders.
“There is so much historical value with the books and space we have here,” said incoming club president Vladislav Sevostianov ’19. “We’ve had filmmakers come, writers, journalists who can come and they can use this space as a resource for their learning about mountaineering history.”
Outing Club president Ariana S. Gross ’18 also said she likes her group’s current office because of its comfortable and down-to-earth feeling.
“We have a really nice room that stores all our gear really well,” Gross said. “It’s a pretty cozy space.”
The College is also working with leaders of the two groups to increase administrative oversight of their activities to make sure safety and liability concerns are addressed to the greatest extent possible. Though leaders of both groups said they believe their current safety standards are adequate, both said they are open to more regulation.
“I don’t think it’s the worst thing, just having some more standardization in terms of how we train people, whether that’s a first-aid certification or a course in ropes-rescue,” said outgoing Mountaineering Club president Rory R. Brown ’18.
“We just want to make sure that the core integrity of the club isn’t broken,” Brown said.
The push for more oversight of outdoor adventure groups is not unique to Harvard. Last week, Penn State administrators banned the school’s outing club from organizing outdoor, student-run trips after determining the club’s activities were “above the University’s threshold of acceptable risk for recognized student organizations,” according to the club’s website.
Leaders of the Outing and Mountaineering Clubs noted one of the best perks of having Adams offices is the building's location—right near the heart of campus. Adams House sits just a few hundred yards from Harvard Yard and is within walking distance of the Charles River.
“It’s very convenient for people on the river to just come by and rent gear,” Gross said.
Thimba said administrators have proposed giving the groups new space in the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center, an athletic facility in the Quad.
“We have presented a proposal for the groups' new location to be at the QRAC in order to align their programs with that of the climbing wall which was installed there last year,” she wrote. "We believe there is an opportunity to enhance the College's investment in outdoor extracurricular activities through this co-location.”
“No final determination has been made at this time, but we look forward to continuing to engage with our students on this,” Thimba added.
The possibility of moving to the Quad, though, could be damaging to the Mountaineering Club, its leaders said.
“Many students at Harvard would view the Quad as somewhere that’s perhaps somewhere more out of the way, especially if they’re living in the River Houses,” Sevostianov said.
In addition, the prospective move to the QRAC could risk damaging the strong community the club has built up over the years, some members said.
“There’s kind of a homey aspect to it,” Brown said of the group’s space in Claverly Hall. “One of my big concerns with this new space is that it’s just not going to have the same kind of hominess that facilitates the kind of community we have now.”
Sevostianov said transporting the club’s gear and library collection, which he called one of the “more impressive mountaineering libraries” outside of those belonging to large national groups, could be costly.
Thimba wrote the College would be “covering costs associated with the move.”
Harvard’s mountaineering organization has a rich history as one of the premier climbing clubs in the world. In 1963, members of the Mountaineering Club, including College students and alumni, trekked to Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, and scaled one of the largest continuous walls in the world. The route has never been replicated and is now known by climbers as the “Harvard Route.”
Sevostianov said the club’s Adams House office used to be the “center of climbing in the world.”
“You read those books, and you know, ‘We start the adventure as we’re going outside of Claverly Hall, we’re about to go to Alaska,’” Sevostianov said. “Those are really inspiring stories, because you sit here and like, wow, the greatest mountaineers in the world were here 50 years ago and I’m sitting where they are now.”
“I’m looking at books that they read,” he added. “This was them.”
Recently, the Mountaineering Club has focused its efforts on local climbs, but continues to take occasional trips overseas—for example, conducting a 2017 expedition to Peru.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 30 undergraduates met with state legislators at the Massachusetts State House Thursday to advocate for five bills as part of the Harvard College Democrats’ semesterly Lobby Day.
The volunteers attended 25 meetings throughout the day to lobby for a variety of bills that would implement a carbon tax, expand resources for sexual assault survivors at higher education institutions, prevent firearm access for dangerous or suicidal individuals, and inform ex-offenders of their right to vote in municipal elections.
“It’s a process that occurs over the whole semester,” Isabel A. Giovannetti ’21, communications director for the College Democrats, said.
Giovannetti said that, at the beginning of the semester, members of the College Democrats’ Policy and Publicity Committee voted on which bills to support. Over the course of the following weeks, participating students researched policies and developed fact sheets, bill summaries, and other materials to inform meetings with legislators on Lobby Day.
Alexander Z. Zhang ’20, the group’s legislative director, said the organization submitted two of the bills through Cambridge representative Marjorie C. Decker the year before.
“We weren’t sure where they were at,” Zhang said. But after some follow-up, he said, the College Democrats decided to push for the bills on ex-offender voting rights and firearm restrictions once again.
Giovannetti said that, because “the goal is to be as effective as possible,” the College Democrats would not “drop a bill” they had pushed for in the past if they saw an opportunity to further its progress.
T’ajmal K. A. K. Hogue ’21 said she thought the legislators she met with were “very receptive.”
Giovannetti said that, in her experience, many of the legislators that students meet with do not necessarily disagree with undergraduates’ stances on the issues.
“It’s just a matter of showing them that these topics, and these bills, are priorities for us,” she said. “There are so many things on their plates. We want to shine a light on these specific bills.”
Reed T. Shafer-Ray ’18, the former College Democrats’ legislative director, said Lobby Day was born out of a desire to make the policy arm of the group more “action-based” rather than just “fantasizing about the policies that we would want to make.”
“It’s amazing how the seed grew—it’s my sixth Lobby Day,” Shafer-Ray said. “I’m really confident and optimistic that it will just get bigger and bigger.”
Since Lobby Day’s inception, Shafer-Ray said, the College Democrats have expanded and built coalitions with other student groups. Additionally, the group continues to lend support to other advocacy efforts throughout the year.
“Lobby Day isn’t just one day. Even after we finish today, we’ll still be doing follow-ups, we’ll still be advocating,” Shafer-Ray said. “The advocacy work really never stops, because the problems never stop.”

This is part four of The Crimson’s five-part series analyzing exit polling data collected during Harvard’s 2018 unionization election. Read the first part here, the second part here, and the third part here.
Harvard students who voted in favor of unionization last week were nearly seven times more likely to report they approve of strikes as a negotiation tactic for student unions than were those who voted against unionization, according to exit polling data collected by The Crimson.
Across all respondents to The Crimson’s survey, roughly half indicated they approve of student union strikes. Per the bylaws of international parent union United Automobile Workers, two-thirds of union members who cast a ballot must vote to authorize a strike for it to take effect.
The exit poll also showed pro-union voters were 13 times more likely to report approval of the UAW than were anti-union voters.
On April 18 and 19, eligible graduate and undergraduate student assistants voted to unionize, meaning Harvard Graduate Students Union-UAW now has the right to collectively bargain with the University on their behalf. A count by National Labor Relations Board officials held April 20 showed 1,931 votes in favor of unionization and 1,523 against.
The Crimson conducted its exit poll on both days of the election, stationing reporters at the three voting locations in Cambridge, Longwood, and Allston for 78 percent of all hours the sites remained open. Reporters collected exit surveys from 1,295 voters, representing over a third of the voting population.
The 23-question survey asked respondents for their opinions on collective bargaining, politics, and campus issues. Unless otherwise noted, the data presented in this story has not been corrected for any possible response bias (see below for methodology).
One survey question asked whether respondents approve, disapprove, or have no opinion of strikes as a bargaining maneuver specifically for student unions. Overall, 52.1 percent of respondents reported approval of student union strikes, while 30.3 percent reported disapproval.
Of respondents who reported they voted in favor of unionization, the vast majority—70.6 percent—indicated they approve of strikes as a negotiation strategy. Just 11.3 percent of anti-union voters, by contrast, reported approving of strikes.
Applying these percentages to the official vote count suggests that, overall, 44.5 percent of voters likely approve of student union strikes.
The NLRB recognizes two broad categories of lawful causes to strike. One category comprises economic reasons—for example, a union might go on strike to demand higher wages or benefits for its members. The second comprises labor reasons—for example, an employer’s refusal to bargain.
Four days before Harvard voters headed to the polls, graduate students at Columbia voted to approve a strike—which began April 24—in response to university administrators’ refusal to bargain with Columbia’s student union. Since April 20, a spokesperson for Harvard has repeatedly declined to answer a question asking whether the University plans to bargain with HSGU-UAW.
In the weeks before the election, union organizers often cited statistics showing that 98 percent of union-negotiated contracts are approved sans recourse to a strike.
Respondents’ opinions on striking varied significantly according to surveyed voters’ divisional affiliation within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Overall, Arts and Humanities respondents were most likely to report support for a strike, with 72.6 percent indicating they would approve of striking.
Sixty-five percent of Social Sciences respondents, 33.1 percent of Sciences respondents, and 20.5 percent of School of Engineering and Applied Sciences respondents reported a favorable opinion of strikes.
The survey also asked voters their opinion of the UAW, giving them the option to select boxes marked “Favorable,” “Unfavorable,” and “No Opinion.”
A plurality of overall respondents—44.1 percent—indicated they have no opinion of the UAW.
A similar statistic holds true for “Yes” respondents, 47.9 percent of whom indicated they have no opinion of the international union. Of remaining “Yes” respondents, 46.8 percent reported they hold a favorable opinion of the UAW, while 5.3 percent reported an unfavorable opinion.
By comparison, of students who voted against unionization, only 3.6 percent indicated they have a favorable opinion of the UAW, while 59.8 percent indicated they view the organization unfavorably. Around 36.7 percent indicated they have no opinion.
Harvard’s union voted to affiliate with the UAW in Sept. 2015 after an “affiliation committee” staffed by early organizers recommended the move. The committee’s stated reasons for the affiliation included increased financial and legal support.
Skepticism of the UAW figured prominently in arguments students against unionization made leading up to the the election. A poster attributed to a group called Liberals Against Unionization of Graduate-Level Harvard Students and pasted around campus the first day of the unionization election read, “I won’t tell you what to do, unlike the UAW.”
In response to these arguments, union supporters have in part cited what they call the UAW’s vast prior experience organizing graduate student unions. With the recent addition of HGSU-UAW, over 40,000 students have now formed unions affiliated with the UAW.
Overall, 12 percent of survey respondents indicated they have previously been members of labor unions, and 17.5 percent of respondents indicated they previously worked or were enrolled at a post-secondary institution that offered a union for students, researchers, or faculty.
Previous experience with labor unions had a small but measurable effect on people’s vote: of respondents who were formerly labor union members, 76.4 percent indicated they supported unionization. Of respondents who reported they had never been a member of a labor union, 69.1 percent voted in favor.
Similarly, of respondents who previously studied or worked at an institution with a faculty or student union, 71.3 percent indicated they supported unionization. Of respondents who reported they had not, 68.6 percent voted in favor.
The data presented in this story is entirely sourced from the exit poll of eligible voters The Crimson conducted during the two days of the April 2018 unionization election.
Crimson analysis of the raw exit poll data indicated voters in favor of unionization were more likely to fill out the survey than were voters who voted against unionization. Specifically, The Crimson calculated an oversampling factor of 1.32 for respondents who reported voting “yes.” The Crimson’s survey specifically asked students whether they voted in the Nov. 2016 election and, if so, whether they had changed their mind on unionization since the first vote.
Using the responses to these questions, The Crimson calculated the 32 percent oversampling by taking the percentage of respondents who reported they voted yes in both the April 2018 and Nov. 2016 elections (out of all respondents who voted in the Nov. 2016 election and indicated they did not change their minds in the interim), then dividing it by the actual percentage of voters who voted in favor of unionization in Nov. 2016. The Crimson utilized this response bias factor, in addition to a geographic correction that reweighted the data by polling site, to infer that approximately 50.6 percent of eligible voters who cast ballots April 18 and 19 voted in favor of unionization.
The official vote count Friday revealed that roughly 56 percent of those who cast ballots voted in favor in unionization, leading to an overall oversampling factor of 1.23. Unless otherwise indicated, the data reported in this story is the raw data from the survey and has not been corrected for this apparent response bias.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s website was briefly hacked by a group calling itself the “Iran Cyber Security Group” late Thursday evening. By early Friday morning, UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 had restored the Council’s webpage to its normal state.
During the hack—which lasted for at least half an hour—visitors to the website encountered a cartoon of President Donald Trump being punched in the chin by an individual whose face was not depicted but who wore a wristband striped the colors of the Iranian flag: green, white, and red.
“DOWN WITH USA,” read a message at the top. Letters in a foreign language scrolled across the cartoon. On navigating to the website, visitors were greeted by loud strains of music in a foreign language.
“Persian Gulf Forever,” the page read near the bottom. The page also listed the hashtags “#DownWithUSA and “#DownWithEsraeil.” The hack was done “in the name of God,” according to text plastered across the top of the page.
The hack appeared to affect only the Council’s homepage, which is hosted on a Faculty of Arts and Sciences domain, according to its URL.
An HUIT Spokesperson could not be reached for comment early Friday morning.
Boucher wrote in a text early Friday morning that, before being notified by The Crimson, he was unaware of the hack.
Approximately 10 minutes later, Boucher wrote that he had “countered their attack” and that he would “work with HUIT to see how they penetrated the Harvard network.”
The hack comes just weeks after the Council gathered hundreds of students’ information as part of legislation to provide subsidies to certain SEF-eligible students for transportation and storage. The information was not submitted to the UC’s website.
Boucher and UC President Catherine L. Zhang promised during last fall’s presidential campaign they would revamp the Council’s website.  Boucher said at last Sunday’s UC meeting that the new website will mostly likely launch in the coming weeks.
Boucher wrote in the text that the Council is “about” to replace its current website with “something much better” and “more secure.”
