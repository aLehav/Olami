After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems a little backwards that the printer word should take a cue from the silver screen, but if literature has an answer to the dark-comedy, it is certainly “A Thousand Morons,” a collection of short stories written by Quim Monzó and translated from Catalan by Peter Bush. It’s a delightful and sobering read that successfully portrays scenes of entertainment and melancholy. It is a somewhat jarring experience, but through brilliantly eclectic prose, absorbing characters, and unique yet complementary storylines, Monzó manages to invite applause more than head scratching.
One quality that unites the discrete stories is Monzó’s frequent use of something you might call literary pivots. In the majority of his stories, there is a pin-pointable moment where things veer toward the bizarre. In “Mr. Beneset,” a run-of-the-mill account of visiting an elderly parent is turned on its ear in an instant. Upon entering his father’s nursing home quarters, the narrator says: “He is straightening some lingerie, black and cream lingerie, the sort the French call culottes and the English French knickers.” In “I’m Looking out of the Window,” an account of clipping one’s nose hairs takes a turn for the macabre: “I would carefully place the scissors on the lobe of this same left ear and all at once close them quickly in order to get a clean cut. Half the ear would sail through the air and land on the kitchen counter.” These abrupt switches lend Monzó’s tales an air of constantly refreshing themselves. Even as we come to anticipate his pivots, the thought that one is coming keeps us on our toes.
The deftness with which Monzó varies his style further precludes monotony. He is like that friend who somehow manages to look good in anything he tries on. Simply beautiful sentences abound in “A Thousand Morons,” but where gorgeous lines by the same author will usually have the same flavor, Monzo’s are enchantingly distinct.  In “Love is Eternal,” Monzó pulls off romantic writing with apparent ease, creating prose that is rife with imagery and arresting in its lyricism. The frank, wistful style Monzó adopts for “The Coming of Spring” lends the tale an emotional heft that astounds despite its potentially draining effect. The contrast between these styles is exemplified in descriptions as different as “a rain that threatened to last till dusk was falling” and “sides of bedsheets that belong to the ghosts of all who have died in the same room and who never cease to walk from one corner to another, grumbling.” Each boasts a beauty in both imagery and word choice that is wholly its own. Appreciation of the lines is augmented by the knowledge that ones precisely like them are unlikely to surface again.
Monzó is equally adept at writing stories meant to shock the reader. In angling for this reaction, he assumes an eerie objectivity. In “Saturday,” he writes, “She takes [the scissors] out and jabs the sharpest point at the skin on the thumb of her left hand, near the nail, and once she has finally made an incision, she puts the scissors down and with her right hand gradually starts to pull the skin away.” Monzó describes this woman’s appalling act with the same straightforward detachment as if she were baking a cake. Such spine-tingling passages make Monzó’s antiseptic delivery of caustic material excruciatingly effective.
It may surprise anyone who catches a glimpse of the cover of “A Thousand Morons” (it features a disembodied bra and moustache) to learn that it is a collection characterized by morbidity. In fact, close to half of the stories included in “A Thousand Morons” are at least peripherally concerned with death. A man considering cataract surgery asks his son, “Why invest all that time and have all those headaches if he knows he’s not got much time left and what little he has is far too much anyway?” A husband and wife describe their super-efficient suicide pact: “Well, as I’ve got two buckets and each holds ten pints, when we cut our veins we will fill the two buckets and then no one will see any blood coming up in any shower tray.” This sort of matter-of-fact moroseness surfaces repeatedly in Monzó’s collection. The response provoked by lines in this vein is powerful—we are at once dismayed by the prospect presented, and disturbed by the nonchalance in which it is couched. Monzó’s ability to evoke such strong emotions simultaneously further displays his adroitness as a writer.
“A Thousand Morons” would be too dark were it not for its highly strategic arrangement: the longest and most depressing story in the bunch is succeeded by three exceptionally short and humorous ones. These briefer efforts are entertaining in the extreme. Monzó’s characters hurl delicious insults like “You, Toni, are but a sample, a grain of sand from the interminable beach of universal discord.” This kind of gorgeous haranguing will make a masochist out of the most self-loving reader. Oh, to be insulted thus!
Short stories are often hampered when authors attempt to cram one hundred pages worth of character development into ten. “A Thousand Morons” is refreshingly devoid of such excess. Take this passage from “I’m Looking out of the Window”: “A kiss from my son, for example. I don’t enjoy the softness of his cheeks or the happiness in his eyes, because I have to be careful nothing happens to him and warn him of all the dangers in life; not to climb over the balcony rail, not to get into a stranger’s car and to chew each mouthful of sandwich twenty times.” The amount of characterization Monzo manages to pack into a single sentence is extraordinary. Very little concrete information is revealed about the man who narrates the story “I’m Looking out of the Window,” yet in the space of 63 words Monzó makes us feel that we know him intimately.
This is not a book made to be read in fits and starts as you wait for a train or cappuccino. “A Thousand Morons” is short enough that it can be read it one sitting, and is probably best experienced in this way. This may be an assemblage of disparate tales, but the cohesiveness of the collection as a whole is such that each story is best appreciated if the ones that precede it remain fresh in mind. If you find yourself glued to the couch in a post-Thanksgiving tryptophan malaise, this may be the perfect book to recharge your mind.

It certainly wasn’t pretty, but the Harvard men’s basketball team will take it.
The Crimson committed 20 turnovers, shot 42.2 percent from the field, surrendered 19 offensive rebounds, and saw its 12-point second-half lead cut to four with 44 seconds remaining.
But thanks to an improved defensive performance, Harvard held on for a 73-64 win against Fordham Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion.
“Obviously both teams [were] somewhat desperate for a win, and I think both teams displayed it,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose squad held Fordham (1-6) to 39.7 percent shooting after surrendering 85 points on 59.6 percent shooting in a loss to Vermont on Tuesday. “A tough game against a team that we knew was going to be coming in here with their best effort.”
With the Crimson’s lead down to four, 67-63, the Rams sent Crimson freshman Agunwa Okolie to the line with 33 seconds to go. Okolie, who entered the game shooting one of four from the charity stripe, knocked down both free throws, and the Crimson (3-3) held on for a nine-point win.
Harvard shot 39 free throws, its highest total since Nov. 2008, and converted 29 attempts, good for a mark of 74.4 percent.
“That’s a weapon for us,” Amaker said. “We want to get [to the free-throw line] a lot, but we want to see if we can convert even more.”
In 18 trips to the line, sophomore wing Wesley Saunders scored 13 of his game-high 17 points. Sophomore forward Jonah Travis added 16 points and 12 rebounds, marking his second career double-double.
But despite the performance of Travis and the Crimson’s advantage at the line, the Rams kept pace thanks to its efforts on the glass. Fordham pulled down a season-high 19 offensive rebounds, six more than the Crimson had surrendered in any game this year, and scored 26 second-chance points.
“[Fordham] did a great job,” Amaker said. “That was probably their best offense. I’m sure they knew that they weren’t scoring that well against our half-court defense, but they were being relentless on the glass. We really have to shore that up to get better.”
Harvard also struggled holding onto the ball, coughing up a season-high 20 turnovers, which turned into 18 Fordham points. Rookie point guard Siyani Chambers committed a career-high six turnovers.
“One of the things we’re going to go up against a lot...is people are really going to try to disrupt him,” said Amaker of the freshman. “They pretty much recognize that we are going to play him as much as we can, and he’s going to get tired, and he’s going to make some silly turnovers as a freshman, and he certainly did that today. But we need him on the floor.”
In the first half, the Crimson battled back from a 21-10 deficit to take a 36-33 lead into the break. Travis fueled the Crimson’s late push, recording all 12 of his first-half points in a stretch of 4:52.
“They were kind of losing track of me sometimes on the box out,” Travis said. “We would have Siyani or Wes penetrate so deep. Whenever you have deep penetration, that leaves a lot of room for weak-side rebounds.”
Harvard extended its advantage throughout the second half, going up by 12 with 4:45 to go off a Saunders free throw.
But Fordham made a late push, cutting the Crimson’s lead to four on two occasions. With 3:18 to play, Rams guard Branden Frazier finished a layup to make it 63-59, but Chambers answered, drilling his third triple of the game to extend Harvard’s lead to seven.
The Crimson went up eight off a Saunders free throw with 1:39 to play, but the Rams cut the lead back down to four after Ryan Rhoomes and Frazier scored back-to-back baskets.
The Rams then sent Okolie to the line, where the rookie knocked down both free throws to put the Crimson up six with 33 ticks remaining. On the other end, Rhoomes got to the line with 20 seconds left and hit one of two attempts.
Travis and Saunders went four for four from the line on the Crimson’s next two possessions to seal the victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It came down to the wire at Hofstra on Saturday, but an 11-4 run by the Harvard women’s basketball team ultimately sealed the overtime win, 70-67.
Up by six with less than three minutes to go in regulation, the Crimson (6-2) held a slight lead, But with 13 seconds on the clock, the Pride (1-5) tied the game with a pair of free throws by senior forward Shante Evans, who had a game and season-high 24 points for Hofstra. Harvard failed to break the tie with seconds left as the game went to overtime.
“We knew we were going to face a team that loves to drive and relies heavily on the inside game with [Evans],” co-captain Emma Golen said. “We knew we had to contain the drive and just make [Evans] as uncomfortable as much as we could.”
The Crimson fell behind in the opening seconds of the overtime period after Pride sophomore forward Anma Onyeuku—who contributed 12 points on the night—hit a jumper and followed it up with a driving layup 20 seconds later.
After putting Harvard within one with her third three-pointer of the game, senior forward Victoria Lippert drew a foul and hit back-to-back free throws to give the Crimson its first lead of the period with 38 seconds left to play. Lippert’s 21 points were a team-high and matched her season-high from Wednesday’s game against New Hampshire.
“[Lippert] was great. She was ice,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She loves contact, and she has the ability to take a hit and finish her shot.”
As the clock wound down, junior guard Christine Clark sunk two from the charity stripe to finish off the game. After leading the team in scoring in the first six games of the season, Clark finished with 14 points—her second-lowest total of the year.
“They were pounding [Clark],” Delaney-Smith said. “She should have gone to the line way more than she did, but she just didn’t get any calls. That was their game plan, to take her out.”
Defense proved crucial in Harvard’s third straight victory. The Crimson held Hofstra to 35 percent shooting from the field in the first half and 39 in the second, which allowed it to stay in the game despite being outscored 30-23 in the second period.
In its sixth win of the season, Harvard topped the Pride in shooting percentage across the board, limiting Hofstra—which has not shot better than 36 percent from behind the arc this season—to two three pointers.
“We knew that their guards were looking to drive to the middle and hopefully get our defense to commit,” Golen said. “We knew outside shooting wasn’t their strength and so we collapsed in the middle.”
The Crimson jumped out to a four-point lead to open the game, but the next 15 minutes were a contentious back-and-forth battle with 12 lead changes. Harvard took control in the last five minutes of the half, going on a 9-2 run to close out the period up by seven.
“We had very different styles of play,” Golen said. “I think they wanted a very quick game and we wanted to slow it down and execute our offense more, so I think there were different times in the game where each strategy was working better.”
The Pride came back reinvigorated after the break, chipping away at the Crimson’s lead and tying up the score at 41 with 12 minutes to play. After trading points for the next four minutes, Harvard opened up a six-point lead—its biggest lead of the half—on a three pointer by Lippert.
With sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle—who ranks third on the team in scoring—missing due to illness, Harvard demonstrated its depth. Led by Melissa Mullins with six points in 21 minutes, the bench contributed 12 points to Hofstra’s two.
With contributions from Lippert and Clark, who went 4-4 and 5-5 from the charity stripe, respectively, the Crimson took advantage of the Pride’s struggle to find the net from the line. Although Hofstra had more than twice as many free throw opportunities as Harvard, it capitalized on only 15 to the Crimson’s nine.
Harvard shot 42 percent from the field, its second lowest performance of the season. Delaney-Smith credits the win to the Crimson’s tough defense, which forced 15 turnovers that resulted in 20 points.
“We toughed it out on the defensive end, and that turned it into a win,” Delaney-Smith said. “That is the kind of team that we’re trying to be, so I’m very proud.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team survived its first major test of the season on Saturday, topping No. 6 Rochester, 5-4, at the Yellow Jackets’ Lyman Squash and Racquetball Center in Rochester, N.Y.
Crimson B and C lineups also picked up two additional wins for Harvard, defeating No. 29 Tufts (4-2, 0-1 NESCAC) and No. 40 UC Berkeley by 9-0 scores in the Boston Round Robin at the Murr Center Saturday.
With two matches left, Rochester (4-1, 4-0 Liberty) had cut a three-match deficit to one. But junior Ali Farag, the reigning individual national champion, emphatically ended any comeback bid, sweeping College Squash Association No. 6 Andres Duany in straight games, 11-7, 11-6, 11-1, to clinch a Crimson victory.
“The funny thing is, when you’ve got a player like Ali Farag, we all know he can win—we all know that he is going to win,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “The whole team, we go into a match, and we’ve already got one match in the bag. We shouldn’t be thinking that, but it’s hard not to when we see how brilliant he is.”
With the win, Farag improved his career individual collegiate record to 18-0.
Freshman Matt Roberts struck first for Harvard (5-0, 1-0 Ivy) at the No.9 position, defeating William Mohr in four games, 12-10, 11-7, 5-11, 11-9.
The Yellow Jackets stung back with a win of their own as Rochester’s Faraz Khan edged junior Gary Powers, 10-12, 12-10, 12-10, 11-9, in the No. 3 match, but the Crimson then proceeded to mount a three-match run.
At the No. 6 position, sophomore Tom Mullaney dropped the first game but swept the next three to snatch a point from Juan Pablo Gaviria, 9-11, 11-5, 11-4, 11-6.
Harvard also spotted its opponents a game before earning come-from-behind victories at the No. 8 and No.2 positions. Co-captain Jason Michas defeated Xiaomen Meng, 6-11, 11-9, 11-5, 11-3, before junior Brandon McLaughlin topped Neil Cordell, 9-11, 11-5, 11-8, 11-1.
“I would call that ‘depth of concentration,’” Way said of the three comebacks. “[Mullaney] just wasn’t playing his own game actually, and then once he got going he knew exactly what to do and just stuck with his guns.”
Michas also made key adjustments to earn a victory for the Crimson.
“[Michas] really changed his strategy [between games],” fellow co-captain Zeke Scherl said. “As an attritional player, he did not just rely on keeping with [Meng] and responding to his attacks on court but [also] implemented his own game and really put [Meng] under pressure. I thought that he played some of his best that I’ve seen him play in a really long time.”
Way was particularly impressed with McLaughlin’s performance.
“He played the best squash that we’ve seen him play in two years,” Way said. “He really just dug deep and found a whole new level of confidence and belief in himself.”
Rochester responded to the 4-1 deficit with a two-match rally at the No. 5 and No. 7 positions. The Yellow Jackets’ Oscar Lopez defeated junior Nigel Koh in four games, 12-10, 5-11, 11-5, 11-7, while teammate Karm Kumar bested Scherl in three, 11-5, 11-9, 11-7.
But despite Rochester’s run, Farag sealed the win in the penultimate match over Duany.
“Duany is a very, very strong player, one of the best in the college scene by far, yet Ali is so much stronger in every department that it’s really remarkable,” Way said. “It’s hard as a coach not to take it for granted.”
Sophomore Tyler Olson closed out the day for Harvard with a four-game loss to Adam Perkiomaki, 11-6, 11-6, 9-11, 11-7.
Earlier Saturday, the Crimson cruised through the Boston Round Robin at the Murr Center as other members of the Harvard’s squad swept to 9-0 victories over Tufts and UC Berkeley. Way was pleased with his team’s display of depth.
“We [coaches] may have been up in Rochester, but the phone was ringing off the hook as each match went down,” Way said. “For those guys to sweep those two, you can imagine how it feels.... It’s so good for those guys further down in order to represent themselves the way they did and carry the banner for Harvard, and the way they did it is just fantastic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team dominated Russia en route to a 4-0 victory in an international exhibition friendly.
The Crimson came into the exhibition game on a four-game winning streak, in which it outscored opponents, 16-3.
Co-captain Jillian Dempsey and sophomore defender Michelle Picard faced a similar team to the one they met at the 2012 women’s world championships while skating for the USA. This year at the world championships, the United States topped Russia, shutting the Russians out, 9-0, en route to a second place finish. Russia finished sixth.
SPREADING THE LOVE
All four of the Crimson’s goals were scored by a different player. Each goal also came off a touch from multiple other Harvard skaters.
The Crimson was able to bring the puck behind the net and cross it in front many times, creating traffic in front of the goalie. This led to open shots on goal and rebound opportunities. Freshman Mary Parker scored the first goal of the game off assists from seniors Kaitlin Spurling and Kelsey Romatoski. Parker returned the favor, finding Spurling to put Harvard up, 2-0.
“That second goal was perfect, going to the net mid-drive,” said Crimson coach Katey Stone, who also coaches the USA Women’s national team. “Mary Parker made a perfect pass to Katie Spurling.”
Harvard relied on its stick skills, using seamless strings of passes to move the puck up the rink quickly and get into attacking position.
“We work on [our passing] all the time,” Stone said. “One of the things we want to do is be the best passing team in the country.”
The Crimson’s speedy crisp passing was needed to beat a much older and sizeable Russian squad.
“We are moving the ball well, using our speed,” said Stone. “It was a physical game, so it was a good balance.”
One of the most notable omissions from the Crimson stat sheet was a goal from Dempsey. At times, Dempsey was able to break to the net, but was held scoreless. But Dempsey’s current 21-game goal-scoring streak remains unbroken, as the matchup was an exhibition game.
TIME FLIES
The Crimson tallied five penalties in the game, but was able to kill each successfully. Currently Harvard ranks second in the country in penalty kill percentage at 88.6 percent.
Freshman goalie Emerance Maschmeyer has been a big reason why the penalty kill has been so effective for Harvard. On the season, she boasts a .75 goals against average.
“We are getting strong goaltending,” Stone said. “You’re goaltender really has to be your best penalty killer.”
Fellow freshman goalie Molly Tissenbaum got her first game action of the season, allowing no goals as well and tallying six saves.
The defense is so crisp that Maschmeyer feels confident that even if Harvard commits penalties, the Crimson will be able to keep its opponents off the board.
“As a goalie, I feel really comfortable with everyone in front of me,” Maschmeyer said. “I’m never worried about it when we get a penalty, it’s like ‘yep, we’re going to kill it.’”
The Crimson held Russia without a shot on three of the five man-advantage opportunities.
“We tend to be really aggressive, and with that comes a lot of communication,” Spurling said. “Our team is really, really close this year, and on the [penalty kill] that’s essential.”
In Friday’s game against Dartmouth, the Crimson killed 11 penalties without giving up a goal, despite being down two players at one point.
WHEN HOCKEY GIVES YOU PENALTIES, SCORE GOALS
On the other side of the ice, Harvard also dominated its foreign opponent. The Crimson came into the game converting 18.9 percent of its power play opportunities, good for 10th in the country.
Compared to its season average, Harvard was more than twice as efficient on power plays, converting two of its four power-play chances.
“Our coaches have been really focused on making sure we do well on the power play,” Spurling said. “We have to take advantage of those opportunities.
Penalties helped the Crimson get on top early, capitalizing on both chances in the first period.

The No. 5/6 Harvard women’s hockey team (8-1-0, 7-0-0 ECAC) racked up and squashed 11 penalties, moving the Crimson up to No. 2 in the nation for penalty-kill at percentage on the way to a 6-0 victory over Dartmouth.
Despite allowing the Big Green (4-3-2, 3-3-1) one-man and even two-man advantages throughout the game, Dartmouth failed to capitalize on power plays, going 0 of 10.
“The way we approached it was [to] just roll with it and adjust,” senior goaltender Laura Bellamy said.
Harvard put up three goals against Dartmouth in the first period alone. The Crimson’s first goal came in the opening five minutes from junior forward Lyndsey Fry who found the net after a deflected shot from co-captain Jillian Dempsey.
Five minutes later, Dempsey hooked the puck around the goal to find Fry who again rocketed it into the net, bringing her goal count to seven for the season.
“Our forwards played great,” Bellamy said. “They are just putting the puck away…. You’re going to win games if you can put the puck in the net like that. They played well, and [the defense] really helped them out, so it was a good team effort.”
At the end of the first period, Harvard led, 3-0, outshooting the Big Green, 10-3. The Dartmouth offense failed to take a single shot until the 18th minute of the contest.
“Today was a lot of fun to play,” Bellamy said. “We got the lead right away, and with the score 3-0 after the first period, we felt pretty good, and that makes it easy on me.”
Heading into the second period, the Big Green had more looks on goal because of a string of Crimson penalties.
But with less than two minutes of play left in the period, the dynamic duo of the night—Dempsey and Fry—had another assist-goal link-up.
Fry found Dempsey who powered the puck into the net for her ninth goal of the season. Dempsey averages 2.22 points per contest, tops on the team.
“Second period was a little crazy, but we weathered the storm,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Those things are going to happen some days, and I think it got back to a more normal situation in the third.”
Although Dartmouth outshot the Crimson, 13-8, in the second period, Harvard still held the lead, 4-0, going into the final 20 minutes.
The Crimson defense, down two players at times, blocked any attempt by the Big Green on goal. Bellamy registered a total of 16 saves in the first two periods alone.
“[You have to] stay in the moment,” Stone said. “Just do the best you can, put the right personnel on the ice, and hopefully get good goaltending, which we did tonight. [Bellamy] was big in those special teams situations, and I think the kid stayed very composed and managed it very well.”
Harvard did not waste any time going into the final period, putting away a fifth goal in the first two minutes. Sophomore forwards Hillary Crowe and Samantha Reber worked the puck down the ice with a give-and-go, ending with Reber scoring off Crowe’s initial deflected shot.
After yet another Crimson penalty in the 12th minute of the final frame, Dartmouth looked to finally take advantage of the power play.
But junior forward Gina McDonald won the puck at the faceoff and took it down the middle of the ice through the Big Green defense to put away Harvard’s sixth and final goal of the match. The goal was McDonald’s first of the season.
“We had a lot of jump,” Stone said. “Everybody was on their toes. We moved the puck very quickly, we transitioned very quickly, and we had some great opportunities right off the bat, and it caught them off guard, I think. To get up on a team like Dartmouth three goals in the first period is pretty good for us.”
Bellamy ended the match with a total of 26 saves, bringing her to a sum of 92 saves this season.
The senior goaltender has secured three shutouts in just five starts in goal, the fifth highest shutout number in the country.
Bellamy also ranks No.1 in the nation in save percentage at 0.968 and goals against average at 0.60.
Freshman goalie Emerance Maschmeyer previously held the lead for goals against average before the Dartmouth contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An American team of college kids needed a “miracle” to defeat the Russian National Hockey team 32 years ago, but Saturday afternoon, the No. 5/6 Harvard women’s hockey team did not need help from a higher power. Instead, the squad rode two first period power-play goals and a dominant defense to knock out Russia, 4-0, in an international exhibition at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson had success on special teams, converting its first two power plays while killing Russia’s five chances with one-woman advantages. The Russians were unable to register any shots on goal during most of its power play opportunities, as Harvard’s forecheck shut down the Russian offense during those periods.
On the offensive side, eight different Crimson players got on the score sheet with goals or assists on a balanced night in which every line contributed.
“We’re starting to click a little bit, and it’s good,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “You see some nice chemistry between a few players or an entire line…and that’s what we’re trying to do. We’ll get it from anywhere, and we’ll get it clean, beautiful, or ugly.”
Harvard got it both beautiful and ugly in the first period. After Russia’s first penalty, the Crimson used effective passing around the blue line to open up a shot for senior forward Kaitlin Spurling, whose shot trickled under Russian goalkeeper Anna Prucova’s legs. Freshman forward Mary Parker was there to tap it home for the first score of the game.
Six minutes later, the duo connected again on the power play, this time with Parker firing a pass to Spurling who beat  Prucova on a one-timer.
While Harvard used its power play opportunities effectively, the squad’s tenacious forecheck kept the Russian offense at bay when the Crimson lost a player.
“With our penalty kill, we aim to be really aggressive, and with that comes a lot of communication,” Spurling said. “The team’s very close this year, and in terms of communication, that’s really essential. I think that’s why we’ve been so successful.”
When Russia did manage shots at goal, it took quality work from Harvard’s goalkeepers to maintain the shutout. After a penalty from senior defender Kelsey Romatoski, Russian winger Olga Sosina juked past the Crimson defense to create a one-on-one opportunity against freshman netminder Emerance Maschmeyer. But Maschmeyer deflected a high shot, allowing her defense to reset.
“Your goaltender has to be your best penalty killer,” Stone said. “But out in front of that goaltender, we are playing pretty well.”
After another Russian penalty, the Harvard offense camped out in its attacking zone, pushing the Russian line physically by keeping them on the ice for an extended spell. But after Russia was finally allowed to change lines, a long pass to senior Hilary Crowe gave her enough room to fire a slap shot over the glove of Prucova to extend the Crimson lead.
After the goal, the team switched goaltenders, with freshman Molly Tissenbaum seeing the ice for the first time in her collegiate career. The freshman went on to make a team-high six saves.
Ninety seconds after Crowe’s goal, the aggressive defense paid off again. Sophomore defender Sarah Edney picked off a pass on the Russian blue line with momentum and sped down the right side of the ice.
She found junior forward Kalley Armstrong with a quick pass to the left, but the junior returned the favor with a one-time pass of her own, leaving Edney with an easy shot past the goalkeeper.
“The two-on-one was as good [of a goal as] I’ve seen in a Harvard jersey,” Stone said of Edney’s goal.
The third period opened slowly, with no penalties or shots on goal for the first several minutes. At one point, senior forward Jillian Dempsey, who has a 23-game point streak going in collegiate play, was able to juke past three Russian defenders but fired just wide of the net.
Harvard continued to dominate possession throughout the period, but could not find a way past keeper Anna Vinogradova, who fought off several scraps in front of her net. But on the other side of the ice, the Russians could not muster enough to beat Tissenbaum, with the international team being outshot by the crimson, 27-11, when the final whistle sounded.
Russia did not leave completely empty-handed, though. The teams held a practice shootout after the match. Both goalkeepers managed to make several saves, but Russia edged the Crimson, 2-1, in the shootout.

Sandrine's Bistro is a contemporary French restaurant located on Holyoke St., a prime location in Harvard Sqaure. Although students may pass it every day on their way to class, because of its lofty price tag, not many may have entered (without their parents, of course.)
Still, if you do dine there on a special occasion, you'll find that the food is worth the price.
The restaurant's menu changes seasonally depending on the ingredients that are fresh in the market.
The Roasted Acorn Squash ($20) was a unique vegetarian dish consisting of sautéed fall vegetables stuffed inside a halved acorn squash. Two thick pieces of marinated tofu with sesame soy glaze were piled atop a medley of broccoli, green beans, and brussel sprouts. Both the savory flavor and the chunky texture of the tofu made me forget that this dish was meatless.
The special on the menu was Pan Seared Diver Scallops ($30) over butternut squash puree. All four scallops were plump with crispy exterior and juicy interior. The dish was full of flavor, from the sweetness of the butternut squash to the richness of the Riesling cream sauce.
The Lobster Risotto ($32) with spinach and cognac lobster sauce had huge chunks of lobster meat. The sauce was savory without being overly creamy, and the spinach added a touch of bitterness to the al dente risotto. Perhaps a dash of salt would have perfected the seasoning.

On Friday, Nov. 30, the Office of Student Life approved 15 new student organizations, one of them Harvard College Munch. Interested in how members of our campus perceive the new club, we sent a reporter to the Yard to find out whether students would rather join Harvard College Munch or what might be considered its opposite, the Harvard College Anscombe Society. Watch the video to find out!

It's that time of year again: Hanukkah, the eight-day long Jewish holiday, is less than one week away. The holiday begins this Saturday at sunset, and lasts until the evening of Dec. 16. For those in the Crimson community who celebrate (and for those who'd like to check it out), Harvard and the surrounding area offer several activities. Flyby picked out a few:
 • Celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah at Harvard Hillel next Saturday with a latke reception and Hanukkah candlelighting with Dr. Alan Garber, Harvard University's provost.
 • Go to the Boston Common any night of Hanukkah from 4 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. for a public Menorah lighting sponsored by Chabad of Downtown Boston.
 • The Central Reform Temple in Boston is hosting a Hanukkah cantata, an annual event in which a group of singers and instrumentalists "explores messages of major contemporary importance for people of all religious traditions" through song. It will take place on the evening of Dec. 9 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The event, called "A Light Through The Ages," is open to all.
In the midst of finals preparation and the end of the semester, it might be a good idea to take a break, eat some latkes, and light some candles.
