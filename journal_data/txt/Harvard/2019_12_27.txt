After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Luminarium Dance Company, a small local contemporary dance company that offers a “unique combination of dance and light” as the name attests, rounded out their fall 2019 season with “Luminarium in Concert” at the Multicultural Arts Center in Cambridge. The roughly hour long show was a novel mix of contemporary dance and Odissi, a classical Indian dance, and it featured brand new choreography set mostly by artistic directors Merli V. Guerra and Kimberleigh A. Holman. The show also featured the company’s defining light-play, with shadow puppets, handheld lights, projectors, and more adding interesting dimension to the pieces. The pieces’ themes ranged from climate change and environmental action to mother-daughter relationships — the latter of which was presented in the form of a film, a “screendance” to be precise.
The first piece, titled “8.7 million minus one” and choreographed by artistic director Merli V. Guerra, explored “the effects of human waste and pollution on the planet’s ecosystems,” according to the company’s website. It was set around three large, square white screens on which shadow imagery, formed by the dancers’ hands and bodies, evoked scenes and animals in nature. The auditory backdrop featured a track of sounds in nature, over which, after a while, a woman began performing spoken word poetry. The layering itself was original and unique; the voiceover, however, was exceedingly casual in tone, and in combination with the dancers’ street clothes and cartoon-like acting, it lent the piece a rather disjointed feel. To its credit, this incoherence may have created a purposeful discomfort to highlight the urgency of the climate crisis — the piece was originally commissioned by Rider University for its Dance & Sustainability Project. Despite its shortcomings, the piece effectively showcased how art can contribute to the agenda of environmental awareness and climate change.
The following two pieces, “like mercury in the palm of my hand” and “RING,” closed out the first act, the softness of the former providing a stark contrast to the driving energy of the latter. The pieces’ lighting came mostly from props: small handheld lights in “like mercury in the palm of my hand,” and harsh white strips that formed a square (“ring”) in “RING.” The two works also featured a lot of partnering, and each set of partners was well in tune with each other, with strong contact and reactions that allowed different sections of choreography to flow smoothly together.
The second act of the show seemed to change gears to focus on the experience of women, opening with the screendance “For you to mentor me,” a short film exploring the mother-daughter relationship. A split screen juxtaposed dancing with images of normal life, making obvious the meaning and emotion behind the movements. Though rather long and meandering in its editing, the film lovingly captured the different desires and feelings of women as they move from being daughters to mothers.
The final piece of the show, an excerpt from the larger project “Contradictions + Casual Self Loathing,” gave dancers the opportunity to share stories of their experiences as women in this world. An unflinching departure from traditional dance, the performers stood in a line facing the audience, lit by small individual lights, and “read” from a rolled up piece of transparent plastic wrap. The piece featured, again, a series of ingenious lighting setups, including a projector with which performers wrote negative words — “clingy,” “cold,” or “bitchy” — which then appeared in shadow on the wall, creating an interactive set. Plastic wrap, symbolically transparent, returned in the culmination of the show. Dancers wrapped the soloist in the clingy material, entrapping her and recalling familiar tropes of women putting down other women. Though she was able to forcefully escape her strange prison, the soloist was never given the opportunity to speak, leaving the audience frustrated and, in that way, providing a unique interpretation of the experience of being a woman.
“Luminarium in Concert” showcased a consistent intimacy and unfettered creativity that helped maintain an overall cohesiveness, while individual pieces invited audience members to explore a variety of topics in a deep, meaningful way. Luminarium Dance Company truly lived up to their name with innovative and unconventional use of lighting and props that enriched an already vibrant dance experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There are no binding oaths between men and lions,” snarled Dennis O’Hare, the sole actor in Homer’s Coat’s Production of “An Iliad.” The echo of Achilles’ growl resonated from the ArtsEmerson stage, a nightly recurrence from Nov, 20 to 24. O’Hare is not only Achilles, however — he is also Hector, Hermes, and Helen. He is a breathing anachronism, a vagabond bard that has wafted from the shores of Troy to the era of Trump, and seemingly witnessed every atrocity in between. “An Iliad” is a tale told by an immortal, full of shadow and fire, undulating through time and tone in search of peace.
The script, written by O’Hare and Director Lisa Peterson, runs Robert Fagles’ translation of Homer’s “Iliad” through a sieve, racing through its plot with gusto and engaging contemporary analogies, interpolating a few lines from the original. It transports its observers from the present to the precipice of an ancient conflict, above the Greek Fleet, into the argument between Agamemnon and Achilles, the death of Patroclus, Hector’s bedroom, and his death.
The rest of the tale is referenced as a series of other songs, but never sung: The writers recognize that the total tale is too long for one man and 100 minutes, and choose to stretch out a few specific moments with a fresh perspective. At one point, O’Hare masterfully interweaves a parody of road rage into Patroclus’ killing spree. In perhaps the play’s most powerful moment, he rattles off, almost uncontrollably, an extended list of bloody conflicts from the Peloponnesian War to the present, emphasizing World War 1 with a visceral scream. O’Hare lingers in the moment, seated under the eerie illumination of a singular spotlight, before ending the lugubrious list with Aleppo.
Most other moments in the play are filled with constant motion, however, which animates the one-man show and engages the audience. Peterson uses every inch of Rachel Hauck’s minimalist scenic design. None of the objects on stage — a table, a chair on its side over to the left, poles — suggest a setting. There is not even a sheet to disguise the stationary lights and ladders backstage.
But what is present is fully taken advantage of. The chair is picked up, spun around, stood on, thrown aside. The table is a bench, a stage, a thing to shove. O’Hare hangs his hat and coat on one pole. Another, which holds up a speaker, is used as an instrument. There is no fake sand, no CGI to imagine for the audience, just a sparse collection of items that demand excellent storytelling, buttressed by the mutating undertones of bassist Brian Ellingsen.
O’Hare brings the rest of the necessary tools with him. The motley of an overcoat, blazer, and antiquated woolen top and belt lend him a fashion too tacky to fit into any era. A bottle of liquor and a worn suitcase, excellent touches by costume designer Marina Draghici, help fill in the margins of his timeless persona. The liquor bottle symbolizes the evolution of the gods (“Tequila Athena”), elucidates a pun on “bar”, and helps legitimate O’Hare’s lapses in memory.
Scott Zielenski’s brilliant lighting design matches the play’s oscillating moods and amplifies its imaginative appeals. When O’Hare rages as Patroclus, grabbing his crotch before a woman screams (two jabs at the patriarchy), the stage is scintillated. The play opens with a singular radiating bulb in the center, beckoning the audience into the past. When he is dramatizing the legend of Achilles, a light is positioned so that his antics cast a giant shadow on the wall. Though the set is simple, light is the medium through which the play projects its fabular content. Luminous extravagance provides a necessary touch of the ethereal.
Achilles was great, but “An Iliad” insists that the costs of conflict are even greater. The stage, set, and cast are small; the story and its implications are astronomical. The writing, acting, and spectacular lights are intense, enthralling, didactic. But the true measure of its success is in the reception of its pacifist lesson: the laughter, the responses shouted to rhetorical questions, the lack thereof. “How do you know when you’ve won?,” O’Hare asks towards the beginning. Across the barren stage behind him, the only answer is silence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent National Labor Relations Board ruling may prevent members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers from using their Harvard-provided email addresses to organize strike efforts, according to experts.
In a three-to-one vote on Dec. 16, the NLRB ruled that employers can prohibit employees from using employer-provided equipment — including email addresses — to organize. This decision overturned an Obama-era ruling that employee communications over employer-provided email systems are protected under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.
HGSU-UAW began its indefinite strike on Dec. 3, after spending more than a year negotiating with Harvard over its first contract.
Since the beginning of the strike, the University and the union have met for only one bargaining session, during which they agreed on six new contract provisions. The two parties have failed to agree, however, on key provisions regarding compensation, health care, and procedures for reporting discrimination and sexual harassment.
The next bargaining session is scheduled for Jan. 7. During that meeting, federal mediators will step in to facilitate negotiations, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain. Harvard first proposed using a third-party mediation service last week.
HGSU-UAW uses email, among other means, to share information about bargaining progress and strike plans with its membership. For instance, union organizers recently announced in an email to members that they would continue the strike into winter break, using “virtual picket lines” to coordinate daily calls to administrators.
In the NLRB decision, the majority wrote that the new ruling adheres to “decades of Board precedent,” adding that the Obama-era ruling it overturned – known as Purple Communications, Inc. – “impermissibly discounted employers’ property rights in their IT resources.”
“We shall overrule Purple Communications and return to the standard announced in Register Guard,” the Board’s decision reads. “Under that standard, employees have no statutory right to use employer equipment, including IT resources, for Section 7 purposes.”
The decision specifies that employer-provided email addresses are a form of employer equipment.
“An employer’s communication systems, including its email system, are its property,” it reads. “Accordingly, employers have a property right to control the use of those systems.”
It remains unclear whether Harvard will decide to prohibit campus unions — including HGSU-UAW — from using Harvard-affiliated email addresses to organize.
Swain declined to comment on whether the University will continue to allow HGSU-UAW to use Harvard emails to organize, writing in an email that the University will first review the ruling.
Former NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV said the new ruling could serve as a “major impediment to both organization and representation” for unions such as HGSU-UAW, and that the decision enables employers to effectively “kill union activity.”
“I think they'll have to wait and see what Harvard does,” he said. “They’ll have to watch to Harvard in the hopes that Harvard proceeds cautiously and carefully.”
Gould added that the University could face problems “practically” if it decides to implement a ban on organizing using Harvard emails.
“Many employers allow their employees to use email for both private communications or nonbusiness communications as well as business communications,” Gould said. “One question that is going to arise in the future is whether a rule which simply singles out union activity… can stand as lawful, even under the Board's decision, if the employer allows employees to use the email for other purposes which are not business-related, particularly if they can use them for other causes, like charitable organizations."
