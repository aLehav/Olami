After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With their 2007 album “Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga,” Britt Daniel and Spoon came dangerously close to being thrust from the not-quite-popular middle ground they had inhabited for at least a decade. 2002’s “Kill the Moonlight” was a critical favorite and 2005’s “Gimme Fiction” was the album that launched a thousand soundtracks, but “Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga” was, perhaps inadvertently, tailor-made for success in 2007 (The stripped-down rock thing worked great that year, just ask Radiohead). Six albums in, Spoon suddenly had consistent radio play and record sales, and more than just music critics realized that Spoon just might be the best American rock band of the 00s.
It’s hard not to look at Spoon’s new album, “Transference,” as something of a reaction to that success. “Before destruction a man’s heart is haughty,” Daniel, quoting Proverbs, begins the album. With his penchant for writing rock music about rock music, the intention to step back a bit seems clear. And throughout “Transference,” the elements that made its predecessor an instant classic—horns, conventional pop structure, songs with more that two chords—are thrown out in favor of a deliberately unpolished sound recalling the band’s lesser-known 90s work.
The shift is both regression and release. For the first time since 1998’s “A Series of Sneaks,” Daniel applies the same ferocity to his vocals as he does towards his one-chord guitar solos. “I want to show you how I love you, but there’s nothing there / I’m not standing here / Oh I’m not standing here,” he yells on “Written in Reverse,” the album’s bluntest approach to its running themes of heartbreak and self-doubt. As its initially clunky piano riff gives way to harsh outbursts of bass and guitar, “Written in Reverse” emerges as a pummeling, persistent beast, closing out the otherwise tightly-wound A-side with well-earned fury.
At the other end of the album’s emotional spectrum, “Out Go the Lights” finds Daniel at his most vulnerable. “There’s a picture of you / standing there in my black wig / looking like, who thinks they know who?” he laments. His frankest song since 2001’s “Anything You Want,” the nostalgic misery finds directness in small lyrical details and Jim Eno’s unbroken backbeat. The pounding “Is Love Forever?” takes a more existential approach to love lost. “When I’m older, start to wonder, was that love or instinct working? / Have I even felt it ever?” Daniel asks on one vocal track, while its counterpart screams over staccato guitar chords.
Manipulation of multiple vocal tracks gives “Transference” a schizophrenic quality. Daniel’s voice suddenly cuts out at the climax of “Is Love Forever?,” returning a second later to ask the titular question in a flood of echoes. “Trouble Comes Running” interweaves two tracks that overlap haphazardly at times. Background hums that materialize and suddenly disappear are scattered throughout the record. Though jarring at first, the unusual mixing decision becomes an essential element of “Transference,” where vocal fragments complement lyrical subject matter within confident, upbeat instrumental performance.
But even with changes in structure and a couple new studio tricks, the songs on “Transference” succeed first and foremost because they are Spoon songs: crisp, tightly crafted, and catchy. Already with an unfathomable five great albums under their belt, the band continues to hone and perfect. “Who Makes Your Money” is the sleek slow-burner Daniel has been trying to write for years, with its midway shift from bass to guitar creating the album’s sublime peak. Even the least thrilling tracks on “Transference”—piano ballad “Goodnight Laura” and the meandering, bass-heavy “Nobody Gets Me But You”—are unmistakably the work of seasoned veterans. At a point in their career where a merely adequate post-breakthrough record would suffice, “Transference” finds Spoon extending their remarkable streak into a third decade. Like each of its five predecessors, it may be their best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 2008’s gargantuan triple-platinum success “Tha Carter III,” Lil’ Wayne became the most exciting and successful act in the rap world. Critics lauded him as inventive and commanding; delighted fans made “Tha Carter III” the top-selling record of 2008; and, in Wayne’s song “Mr. Carter”, rap-deity Jay-Z was seen as having passed the hip-hop crown to Weezy.
So it comes as a shock that on his newest album, “Rebirth,” Wayne leaves rap music behind altogether in favor of an as-yet uncharted genre: rock. In this latest effort, Wayne abandons rap’s sampled beats for a bass, drum set, and electric guitar. Power ballads of unrequited love replace tales of street violence and self-promotion, and the dissing and calling out of other rappers is tossed out in favor of punk-inspired castigation of society and nameless enemies. This bold step, however admirable it might be in theory, comes nowhere near the creation of good music.
In truth, Wayne’s rap-to-rock and rock-to-rap translations lose significantly more than they gain. The crucial elements of the artist’s past success have been pop grooves that were radio-ready, like “Lollipop”, and aggressive, brash songs you could still bounce your head to and enjoy, such as his first major hit, “Go DJ.” The sort of fun and confidence that were needed to produce these big hits runs contrary to the seriousness of the major theme of “Rebirth”—success in all its forms and the problems and re-evaluations that result from it. Worse, the narrative that carries this theme is banal and in many senses childish. There is an inherent incongruity in the combination between Wayne’s hackneyed stories and the punk-influenced, angsty rock music that he is drawing upon.
“Prom Queen” is one of the worst examples of Wayne’s lyrics running directly against the musical background. The music is forceful and angry as an electric guitar pounds out a progression identical to that found on the punk-metal band System of a Down’s 2001 hit single, “Chop Suey,” and Wayne’s slow, aggressive, auto-tuned drawl recalls Marilyn Manson. On top of this, Wayne tells an unbearably trite story about high school in disappointingly simplistic language. Explaining how his feelings for the prom queen were never returned, Wayne whines, “She didn’t realize she chased the type of guys / That don’t believe in ties, trying to apologize.” Not only does this story lack all of the angst present in the music, but its rhymes are contrived and fail to inspire any empathy in the listener. Wayne’s triumphal final boast, “But now the prom queen... / Is crying sitting outside of my door,” cheapens the other emotions expressed in the song and prevents the listener from sympathizing with his lonesome high school self.
Wayne continues this trend of combining punk, metal, and rock influences with middle school pop lyrics throughout “Rebirth.” In “Paradice,” Wayne copies the narrative structure of Journey’s legendary “Don’t Stop Believin’,” rapping first, “she was a young girl,” and then, “he was a young boy;” and directly references Smash Mouth’s equally famous “Allstar,” rapping, “everything that glitters ain’t gold.” He fails to come within throwing distance of either Journey’s story-telling skill or Smash Mouth’s fun, however, and the song just elucidates the gaping abyss between great rock stars and Lil’ Wayne. “The Price is Wrong” features a similarly loud and angry guitar coupled with an absurd story about lost high school love and the fact that Lil’ Wayne thinks, “I was the baddest motherfucker in the lunchroom, classroom, her room.”
“Rebirth” gets truly hollow, however, when Wayne tries to be serious. On “Runnin’,” the electric guitar almost sounds acoustic as a set of minor-key, somber strums set the song in a grave light. “We all in the race, I’m just another sprinter / If there’s no finish line then who’s the real winner?” Wayne broods. This attempt at real reflection sounds almost comical with the combination of wailing female vocals, ponderous guitar riffs, and Wayne’s attempts at punch line epiphanies.
Wayne’s only successful attempt at assimilating his rap background with rock music comes on “Ground Zero.” Two electric guitar lines produce a frenetic beat that is further energized by pounding drums and a screaming Wayne, who raps about the pitfalls of a bad drug trip. “How can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on?” Wayne asks, as he explains, “I’m so high that the ground is gone.” Wayne for once manages to match the fast moving metal-rock sound that is dominant throughout “Rebirth” with an appropriately aggressive lyrical flow and maniacal spirit, creating a disappointingly isolated highlight.
“Ground Zero” seems to prove, then, that there is some room for success in Wayne’s conception of a rock album. Indeed, the problem with “Rebirth” is not that a rock album was a bad idea, though it was ambitious and risky. Rather, this record is such a failure because Wayne is almost completely incapable of executing what might have been an interesting experiment.

Last spring, American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) director Diane M. Paulus ’87 gave undergraduates fifty free tickets to her production of “Hair” on Broadway.  This month, students benefit from further collaboration with the A.R.T.—but they also learn that it’s not all fun and games.
“Acting as foxes is extraordinarily painful,” Christian A. Rivera ’13 explains, describing his roles in the upcoming A.R.T. production of Tennessee Williams’ “Stairs to the Roof”, which opens on Thursday.
“I’m the fox, I’m the message boy, I’m a soldier, I’m a youth at a carnival,” he says. “I have very few speaking roles. It’s more a treat to watch professional actors work and see what it takes.”
“Stairs to the Roof” is the first joint production of the Office for the Arts (OFA), the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) and the A.R.T. Institute. The last of Williams’ apprentice plays, “Stairs” tells the story of a factory worker in the 1930s who breaks away from his mechanical life and embarks on a fantastic adventure.
According to assistant director Matthew C. Stone ’11, the collaboration between undergraduates and professionals is the best aspect of the production.
“I do want to go into theater professionally and this is the first opportunity [at Harvard] that really gives undergraduates the chance to participate in the realization of a professional show,” Stone says.
Director Michael M. Donahue ’05 says he and the organizers of the production went to Common Casting last fall without a set number of undergraduates in mind. Besides choosing six production assistants, they ended up selecting three freshmen to round out their cast.  These nine students also participated in the A.R.T. Institute’s January Undergraduate Theater Training Intensive, a graduate-level theater program from January 4 to January 23.
“Stairs” is only Rivera’s second play since he began acting in musicals as a junior in high school.  It is his first show at Harvard, apart from his involvement in the Freshman Arts Program.
He says that being able to watch the Institute actors work has allowed him to see the incredible amount of dedication involved in professional acting.
In rehearsal, he says, the actors spent ten hours perfecting for a two minute scene and improved upon it each time.
“Just when you think they can’t think of something new, they do,” he says.
Stone, who previously directed undergraduate productions including “Attempts on Her Life” and “The Birthday Party,” says the collaboration posed a challenge in terms of accommodating everybody’s schedules.
While college students are dealing with classes and shopping week, the graduate students are understandably more accustomed to the pace and hours of rehearsals. Add to that the physical intensity of the play, and the end result is a mix of exhaustion and excitement.
“In general, the challenge of working on the production is keeping the energy at a constant high level,” Stone says.
For Donahue, the collaboration also presents a chance to produce a play of “great imagination” while giving students the invaluable experience of working in a professional dramatic production.
“As a Harvard undergrad I remember coming here and feeling very hungry to find new answers and break out of the world that I had been living in [in] high school,” Donahue says.
There was no opportunity, he says, for formal engagement between the A.R.T. Institute and undergraduates during his time at Harvard and is excited to be able to facilitate this new initiative.
He describes his directing style as one that strives to break down the “fourth wall” between the audience and the actors.
“I tend to be interested in work where we are all in the same room together, where we’re breathing the same air, and we’re on the same breath,” he says.
With “Stairs”, Donahue has brought down a wall of a different sort­—by integrating two distinct communities of performers, each holding their breaths as they anticipate Thursday’s opening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As jazz was a generation ago, American folk music is beginning—too late, as many enthusiasts insist—to be embraced and studied by the academic world. In that vein, “Fire on the Mountain”—a day-long symposium featuring world-renowned scholars and performers, including Grammy-awarding winning composer and banjo player Alison H. Brown ’84—aims to explore the roots, methods, and culture of bluegrass this Saturday in the Barker Center.
The symposium will open with remarks from E. Forrest O’Connor ’10, president of the Harvard College American Music Association (HCAMA), and Deborah Foster, a Folklore and Mythology senior lecturer who helped adapt the department’s annual symposium to feature bluegrass music. Brown and her husband Garry West, co-founders of Compass Records—a record label that specializes in part in bluegrass music—will join scholars to discuss the roots of the genre. The day will culminate with an evening performance by Clint W. Miller ’11, Brown, legendary bluegrass fiddler Bobby Hicks, and mandolinist Sam Bush—who is credited with the invention of the “Newgrass” style.
The annual symposium organized by the Folklore and Mythology department, now in its sixth year, aims to integrate artistic production and intellectual inquiry in the field of folklore, according to Foster.
“Although this event follows the model of the past [Folklore and Mythology] events, it goes even further in its attempt to integrate the making of the music, including the construction of the instruments, and the scholarship that has investigated not only the musical form itself, but also its place in American social and cultural life,” Foster wrote in an e-mail.
Matt Glaser, Artistic Director of the American Roots Music Program at Berklee College and the keynote speaker of the symposium, stresses the legitimacy of bluegrass music in an arena of serious intellectual discourse. “I’ll play little clips of bluegrass to demonstrate the kind of Shakespearean depth that this music has,” he said. “Just because it’s often a bunch of guys with cowboy hats not saying many words doesn’t mean it’s not deep music worthy of study. In my opinion bluegrass music is one of the highest American art forms.”
O’Connor, who plays the mandolin, notes that bluegrass is one of the few subsets of American folk music that was largely pioneered by one person. Mandolin player Bill Monroe formed the Blue Grass Boys in 1939, and was later joined by banjoist Earl Scruggs and singer/guitarist Lester Flatt. Bluegrass, whose instrumentation includes guitar, banjo, mandolin, double bass, and fiddle, emerged as a kind of commercially disseminated folk music a decade later. It then began to permeate early rock music in unexpected ways: the offbeat mandolin chop characteristic of bluegrass music, for example, eventually evolved into the snare-drum offbeat in rock and roll.
“Although scholarly interest in bluegrass arose in the ’50s and ’60s, some folklorists called the folklore of bluegrass ‘fakelore’ because it was viewed as too commercial and too popular,” O’Connor says. “But until the late ’50s it was known largely as ‘hillbilly music’—in a sense, you can’t get more folky than that. It occupies its own funny segment of the music world.”
The concept of a bluegrass symposium at Harvard emerged years ago. Brown expressed interest in coming back to the college to perform after playing in a concert for President Drew Faust’s inauguration in 2007. O’Connor had dreamed of organizing an event of bluegrass music since he founded HCAMA with banjo player Clayton D. Miller ’10 that same year. “We built on jam sessions and thought we should try to represent the style of indigenous music on campus more,” O’Connor says.
Jack C. Megan, Director of the OFA, helped coordinate the effort and provided funding for the event. “We are always trying to support underrepresented art forms. We also recognize that there are a lot of brilliant people here, and sometimes one of the best things an office for the arts can do is not think it has all the ideas. So when a Forrest O’Connor shows up, we’d be crazy not to respond.”
Megan lauded the synergism of administrative, faculty, and student groups that contributed to making the event a reality. “It’s a model of productive collaboration among three distinct constituencies,” he says. “That kind of collaboration is rewarding on a personal and a professional level.”
While the lineup will likely draw many diehard bluegrass fans, O’Connor hopes that the event will educate newcomers about the genre. “If we can make five students think differently about music or really come to appreciate bluegrass, then we’ve achieved something big,” O’Connor says. “Hopefully the symposium will be more than that.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 2, 2010
An original version of the arts article "Bluegrass Educates with Sound of Music" called Sam Bush a bluegrass fiddler and Bobby Hicks a mandolinist. In fact, Hicks is the fiddler, and Bush the mandolinist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walking through Harvard Yard after an English section last fall, another student and I began speculating as to whether any writer had convincingly portrayed the experience of falling in love. Tolstoy developed it too suddenly and Austen privileged convention over emotion. And for Nabokov, love was a clinical affair; a warm body lain on ice. Entomologist, chess-player, master of three languages, and arguably the greatest prose stylist of the 20th century, the ever-meticulous Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov could reach sublime artistic heights, my interlocutor admitted—but who would want to inhabit such chilly air?
The reaction is not an uncommon one. “Lolita,” published in 1955, provoked scandal not for any outward lewdness, but for its relentlessly dispassionate treatment of a traditionally pornographic subject. There’s something of the scalpel in those descriptions of 12-year-old Lo’s “pre-adolescently incurved back, that ivory-smooth, sliding sensation of her skin through the thin frock.” Of course, such detached precision—each word set down deliberately as a pin through the thorax of a butterfly—was for Nabokov a conscious choice, allowing him to scale ever more crystalline summits. “For me,” he wrote, “a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss.”
The posthumous publication of Nabokov’s uncompleted last novel “The Original of Laura” thus comes as an uneasy blessing. There are characteristic moments of stylistic brilliance, but admiring them is a bit like calling attention to the gilt cornices of a house left lacking a door. Roughly the first half of the book is devoted to Flora, a grown Lolita-type, bored with her marriage to a psychologist named Philip Wild and carrying out numerous affairs. Meanwhile, an obsessive former flame is writing an erotic novel about her titled “My Laura,” a crazed production, but one in which “fixed details as her trick of opening her mouth when toweling her inguen or of closing her eyes when smelling an inodorous rose are absolutely true to the original.” The second, more sketchily outlined half segues into Philip’s quasi-sexual attempts to will himself out of existence—for the “process of dying by auto-dissolution afforded the greatest ecstasy known to man.” It’s not clear how the parts were meant to be linked, though early on Flora does refer to the “mad neurologist’s testament” her husband has been laboring over for years. Nabokov’s writing process as glimpsed here seems to have involved piling together neat phrases (e.g. “pinaforing her stomack with kisses” [sic]) in the hope that there would be time later to arrange them into a plot.
But the structural level is just where his language begins to break down. The thrill of the Nabokovian sentence lies in its intense compression, that hyper-compacted poetry of the apposite adjective or unexpected metaphor that separates it from the more loosely polemical Russian literary tradition. It’s why Nabokov adored Tolstoy’s taut prose and thought Dostoevsky a hack. In “Laura” this compression unravels—degenerating near the end into mere personal notes (“invent tradename, e.g. cephalopium”) and haphazard lists (drawing linkages between self-dissolution and Buddhism).
Indeed, great ethical question marks surround the matter of whether “Laura” ought to have been published at all. Nabokov’s last wish was that it be burnt should he die before its completion, a worst-case scenario that came to pass in 1977 when the complications of fever took him in Switzerland. The literary world at once divided in two: the “publish” camp happy to get their hands on whatever they could from the man they considered a genius, and their “perish” antagonists urging incineration lest any imperfection blacken the Nabokovian halo. One might assume that the recent green light points to some newly unearthed document or deep philosophical revelation. Not so. In an absurd introduction seeking to defend the decision, Nabokov’s son Dmitri waxes at turns cloyingly idolizing, stridently resentful, and distastefully self-aggrandizing in his memories of his father. He concludes by asking the question his entire essay has been begging: “But why, Mr. Nabokov, why did you really decide to publish ‘Laura’?” The response: “Well, I am a nice guy, and, having noticed that people the world over find themselves on a first-name basis with me as they empathize with ‘Dmitri’s dilemma,’ I felt it would be kind to alleviate their sufferings.”
Nabokov deserves better than his offspring’s circular logic; these notes for what could have been remain genuinely tantalizing, especially in their flirtation with the idea of an “original” in a world in which people can be novelized, duplicated, or obliterated as desired. Yet his taste for parody trespasses well beyond tongue-in-cheek. Every character is either neurotic, socially oblivious, a raging nymphomaniac, or all three. Philip Wild is not only morbidly obese, but can be seen walking striped cats on leashes down the street. Flora is groped at age 12 by an older man named “Hubert H. Hubert” (many characters are lifted near-wholesale from Nabokov’s other books). And embarrassing puns abound—a miniature chess set is given to Laura because “she knew the moves,” a “potentate is potent” until the age of 80—which simply never would have reached print.
Perhaps attempting to compensate aesthetically, Alfred A. Knopf has pulled out all the stops in the book’s physical presentation. Possessing a pleasingly minimalist jacket featuring white letters dissolving into black, “Laura” reproduces on each page of its heavy gray cardstock one of the 125 lined index cards on which Nabokov penciled his story. And each card is perforated along the edges for the ultra-aficionado—who, having exhausted the author’s other collections, can pop out the notes to feverishly arrange and rearrange elements of the plot just as Nabokov himself is said to have done.
But these picturesque, slightly kitschy touches still don’t quite succeed in distracting from the work’s insubstantiality. “A novel in fragments” may be the phrase of choice in the marketing materials, but the truth is that “Laura” is hardly more than an assemblage of disconnected scribblings; reading diligently, one can get through the entire thing in under an hour. The difference in quality between this and Nabokov’s other works, too, is painfully clear. However much Nabokov’s other posthumously published work “The Enchanter” existed primarily as a sketch for “Lolita,” the stave of its aesthetic virtuosity was enough to ward off doubters. “The Original of Laura” had far less time to develop in the darkroom of its brilliant author’s mind; no surprise, then, that its desk-drawer jottings come out unflatteringly when exposed to the harsh glare of any more critical light.

Beach House’s “Teen Dream” is the musical version of a narcotic, carrying away the listener into a heavenly realm of lush pop melodies and intimate organ beats. Coming into their own on their third album, the Baltimore dream pop duo—consisting of Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally—maintain their past convention of chill intimacy, while adding new layers that knit together to produce a more polished sound, setting the album apart from their previous work.
This newer, more refined sound successfully complements the group’s developing lyrical philosophy. The idea of love as enslavement that was evident on 2008 sophomore album “Devotion” has been twisted here into an image of love as enchantment. The hypnotic cage is now a hypnotic spell, delivered in a musical atmosphere similar to that which last year brought Grizzly Bear success.
From the start of “Zebra,” the first and arguably best track on the record, the music is dreamlike and catchy, holding the listener under its trance of deep, soothing vocals and repetitive but variant beats. Legrand communicates a sad and disappointed air, while refusing to let her love die.
This opening eases us into the slight sock hop feel of “Silver Soul,” which sounds precisely like the “medicine for heartache” that the lyrics promise. The back-up vocals harmonize furtively but effectively with Legrand’s voice, which itself seems possessed by the love of which she sings. The incredible standard of the songwriting is revealed by the constantly shifting references to an “It,” which appears at the beginning as “a vision, complete illusion,” but later becomes, “a sickness, a manic weakness.” The song addresses the intense, overwhelming excitement of falling in love, like a pleasant but tortuous emotion that constantly picks up momentum.
After this high, despair comes a couple of songs later in “Walk in the Park,” where melancholy is consoled by Scally’s dominant keyboard melody. The lyrics have a great internal rhyme scheme—“The face that you saw in the door isn’t looking at you anymore / The name that you call in its place isn’t waiting for your embrace / The world that you love to behold cannot hold you anymore”—and the simple image of walking in the park to forget your heartbreak manages to remain powerful.
The songwriting is so precise that the moaning vocals and the densely layered music complement each other seamlessly. Each song on “Teen Dream” is a painstakingly crafted wonder. When Legrand’s voice rings out on exaggerated vowels, the music follows suit, sweeping the listener along in a daze. “Used to Be,” a rerecorded version of the track that first appeared on a 2008 single release, exemplifies this fuller sound unique to “Teen Dream.” An upbeat piano ballad of sorts, its poetic unanswered questions address the pangs of growing apart. On this and other tracks, the emotional core of the song is consistently detectable on the surface. Beach House’s music has matured and it shows.
“Norway” is the most dreamy of all, with fairy tale imagery and singing so soft it’s almost like Legrand is gasping for air. “Lover of Mine” is the most instantly accessible track on the album, where the starlight sounds are only slightly offset by the deepness of Legrand’s voice. “10 Mile Stereo,” a late album highlight, follows suit with an uncertain organ and a quick, almost Postal Service-esque beat.
The album closes with “Take Care,” which encapsulates the album’s exploration of the glowing, growing, capital “L” kind of Love—“It’s no good unless it’s real, hill sides burning / Wild-eyed turning til we’re running from it.” The ultimate fade-out ends the LP on a thoroughly satisfying note.
Beach House has truly hit a creative stride and the result is innovative and beautiful music. With its depth and sweep, the soporific melodies explore the internal difficulties of eternal teenage feelings. Such is the triumph of “Teen Dream” that, so early in the year, 2010 may already have seen one of its best albums.

For a week in mid-February, the Harvard community will have one more way to witness the exchange of virtue for self-liberation—and this time it won’t just be your roommate shaking off the January blues. Instead, this spectacle comes in the form of a comic, irreverent tale of innocence lost and knowledge gained: the Dunster House Opera’s upcoming production of Benjamin Britten’s “Albert Herring.”
The opera tells the story of an English town that, frustrated in its unsuccessful attempts to find a girl virginal enough to wear the May Queen’s crown, decides to give the position to the timid and naïve Albert Herring. This unexpected turn sets off a series of capers that tests Albert’s virtue and the community’s values.
Stage director Stewart N. Kramer ’12 hopes “Albert Herring” will resonate with audiences at Harvard. “It’s an opera that is very much about young people, about the experience of being young. Even though most of the characters are older, the entire crisis is about youth and lost youth,” Kramer says.
It is also a genuinely comic opera by Britten, one of the 20th century’s greatest composers who is best known for his expansive and probing works. Librettist Eric Cozier’s English-language text is “highly conversational” and “very funny,” Kramer adds.
Yet Zander J. MacQuitty ’10, who plays the titular role, believes the show’s appeal rests most firmly on its universality. “Everyone sees themselves in Albert,” he says.

Vampire Weekend are a rather unremarkable band. Ezra Koenig and company are little more than a few slightly preppy guys who got together at Columbia and started writing charming, inoffensive pop songs. Their most remarkable feature, their influence by African music, has in fact been vastly overstated and, given the recent success of internationalist groups like Yeasayer and The Very Best, it’s much less novel than it was back in 2007.
That Vampire Weekend have grown into one of the most popular independent bands of the last few years is therefore something of a surprise. That they have attracted a considerable backlash from hipster circles is possibly even more surprising. There’s very little to dislike in their songs: the lyrics are tinged with intellectualism, but their vagueness and anti-elitism renders them pretty harmless. The music is a delicate blend of indie pop, steady rhythms, and chamber music: again a combination not designed to offend. Vampire Weekend know what they do and they do it well, as proven on their second album, “Contra.”
“Contra,” which recently topped the Billboard charts, is exactly what one could expect from Vampire Weekend—solid, enjoyable music, gently pushing at its own boundaries, yet just a little unremarkable. It’s hard to imagine how anyone could reasonably love or hate it: it’s good, and that’s about it.
“Contra” is in many ways very similar to the band’s self-titled debut. The opener, “Horchata,” quickly proves that the band is quite content to continue in the same style that first brought them success. The lyrics appropriately hint at the need to accept one’s limitations, Koenig singing, “Oh you had it but oh no you lost it / Looking back you shouldn’t have fought it.” The song steadily builds momentum, incorporating woodwind and strings that subtly bring to mind their debut’s “M79.” “Horchata” doesn’t take the listener anywhere especially exciting, but it’s a pleasant trip that successfully introduces the rest of the album.
“White Sky” continues in a very similar vein, its wordless chorus demonstrating the range of Koenig’s voice even when he resorts to yelping over singing. In almost any other hands this would be grating, but Koenig’s voice is so charmingly mercurial that he can pull it off. This opening duo, as well as later tracks like “Run” and “Diplomat’s Son” easily could have been lifted off their debut album; such is the continuity in style and substance.
“Contra” is not, however, a carbon copy of its predecessor. “Taxi Cab” is the group’s first real ballad, a beautiful baroque affair featuring endearingly uncertain romantic lyrics: “You stood so close to me / Like the future was supposed to be.” “Giving Up The Gun” is the biggest step forward for the band’s songwriting skills and possibly the best song on the LP. It is also one of the darkest and most direct songs the group has yet penned. The atmosphere of anxiety and regret are new, yet the backing vocals and shimmering synth line ensure that the song retains the warmth that characterizes most of the group’s oeuvre.
The most radical change on the album is its lead single, the effervescent “Cousins.” Racing along like “A-Punk” on speed, it’s an unusually stimulating highlight. The way Koenig spits out convoluted lyrics like “Dad was a risk taker / His was a shoemaker / You greatest hits 2006 little list-maker” is admirable given how little time each verse allots him.
Sadly, the album contains a few regrettable missteps. “Holiday” features an appalling non sequitur of a bridge, out of nowhere introducing the story of a girl protesting against the Iraq War by becoming a vegetarian into a song that seemed to be about vacations. There is no real point to the political sidestep, and it sits very awkwardly with the song and the album as a whole. On “California English” the group for some reason chooses to auto-tune Koenig’s voice, with terrible results. Closer “I Think Ur A Contra” is easily the least interesting song on the album. The mournful strings that enter halfway through strike completely the wrong tone, and, like “Holiday,” the song rather awkwardly references political events—the Nicaraguan resistance that gives the album its title—to no definable purpose.
These imperfections only serve to reinforce what is clear even in the album’s better moments: Vampire Weekend are not a “great” band. “Contra” is overall a decent album, and finds just the right balance of advancing and holding ground to prevent a sophomore slump. This pragmatism and the group’s talents have seen them achieve considerable success. Just don’t expect them to ascend to anything more remarkable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eudora Welty once wrote, “What I do in the writing of any character is to try to enter into the mind, heart and skin of a human being who is not myself. It is the act of a writer’s imagination that I set the most high.” Lorrie Moore admires Welty and, on a vacation to Jackson, Mississippi took a photo of Welty’s house for her scrapbook. She appears to have retained Welty’s words as well. In her newest novel, “A Gate at the Stairs,” Moore enters completely into the mind, heart and skin of a dynamic and perceptive college student, and in doing so, has created an incisive portrait of life in America immediately after September 11th.
“A Gate at the Stairs” chronicles a year in the life of Tassie Keltjin, the 20-year-old daughter of a potato farmer who has left her hometown of Dellacrosse, Illinois, to attend college in Troy, a nearby university town. The novel starts in 2001, a few months after September 11, and focuses loosely on Tassie’s experiences working as a nanny to Sarah and Edward, a pair of well-meaning, well-to-do liberals who take a sanctimonious and labored approach to parenting their adopted mixed-race toddler.
“We are doing something important, unprecedented and unbearably hard,” Sarah says in reference to raising a biracial child in a prejudiced community, with a superciliousness that makes for a typical target of Tassie’s witty internal monologue. Tassie’s tone careens between ribald and elegiac, making “A Gate at the Stairs” a novel to read with caution. Tassie’s familiar voice can distract from Moore’s understated style and her love of detail and word games.
Although Moore’s tone is usually straightforward and conversational, she is at heart a writer deeply concerned with language, and many of Tassie’s insights about life in Troy are born from observations about local idiom. When a character drops the word “hogwash,” Tassie deadpans, “I had once seen a hog washed. In whey. The hog was Helen, and she really liked it, the slop of the whey, then later a cool hose.” Her constant language-play calls attention to the separate vernaculars of Troy and Dellacrosse.  As a result, the novel establishes an unusual and rather negative role for language—that of a barrier in the way of communication.
In the midst of the city’s political anxiety, Tassie seems to be a magical heartlander, a sort of cornfed mystic who bemusedly observes her employers’ frantic railing against racism, fate, and Karl Rove. Her dialogue is laconic, but her inner monologue is full of surprisingly acute observations. Moore gives Tassie an interest in the unsavory and a preoccupation with Sufism, extending Tassie’s savant-like eccentricities to ridiculous levels. Just when her confusion at the hypocrisies of people around her begins to cross the line between clever and insufferable, she’ll use her roommate’s vibrator to stir a glass of chocolate milk, or write a college paper about “The Plausible Sufic Geology of Stonehenge.” Tassie is at once herself, and a parody of herself, and if she still has a precious, irritating streak—well, who doesn’t at twenty?
The other characters in “A Gate at the Stairs” initially seem flat—they are colorful, but the reader is never given enough information to theorize about their motives. An epiphany concerning Tassie’s employers near the end of the novel explains some of their actions, but it ultimately reveals more contradictions than solutions to the mystery of their behavior. In the hands of a writer less observant of human nature, the enigmatic behavior of the supporting characters would rob the novel of its internal consistency. But Tassie’s observations of the people around her are often skewed by her misunderstandings of her new city and her employers, and the way their behavior confuses her is crucial to the novel’s concern.
In a 2005 interview with The Believer, Moore claimed that “awkwardness is where the tension is, and tension is where the story is.” If that is the case, story permeates every word of spoken dialogue in this book; dialogue that never seems to reflect what the characters mean. The novel is fraught with moments in which characters don’t quite seem to be responding to what actually has been said, creating a symphony of crossed wires.
Despite Moore’s unusual approach to creating characters, the most rewarding moments of “A Gate at the Stairs” come when Tassie is alone, reading and cooking and playing her bass in an apartment that feels too big. These quieter, pensive moments are lovely in their understatement and their insinuation of a profound loneliness that hangs over Tassie and Troy but is never directly acknowledged.
Moore’s concern with emptiness, decay and missed social connections should not imply that “A Gate at the Stairs” lacks humor. It is riotously funny, and not in the sardonic, bitter way of more traditional tragicomedies. Its puns and its politics are bold and even ostentatious, but this novel’s significance lies in its tightly constructed details and its singular main character—irksome, charismatic and wholly convincing.

Los Campesinos! have never lived up to the carefree cheerfulness their exclamation-pointed name would seem to imply. On the contrary, their first two albums traded in a heightened teenage angst that would have bordered on gloomy were it not for the relentlessly cheerful twee pop sound enveloping it.
Tracks like the aptly-named “Miserabilia” off sophomore mini-album “We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed” featured intertwining, irrepressibly cheerful guitars and keyboards, chiming bells, and unmistakably indie pop boy-girl vocal harmonies. And then there were the lyrics: “We got nostalgic, ended up filling shoeboxes with vomit / Collected scabs in lockets, hung them round our necks like nooses / None of it mattered / Nobody cared.”
So to say that the band’s third effort, “Romance is Boring,” is a bleaker, angrier record is no small statement. The transformation in emotional tone is partially rooted in the lyrics, which retain their visceral but heartfelt quality within an expanding thematic range. Encompassing anorexia, losing parents, meaningless sex, abuse, and loss of faith, as well as more well-trodden romantic territory, the topics at hand are far from cheerful. More than anything, though, the tonal shift comes down to the band further shedding their twee image for a noise-influenced, experimental, nearly anarchic sound foretold by guest appearances by members of Xiu Xiu and Parenthetical Girls.
The tracks which best exemplify this change populate the middle of the album. The brilliant “Plan A” retains some of the catchy, endearing elements—anchored by lead singer Gareth’s nasal vocals—that made Los Campesinos! likeable to begin with, but channels them into a two-minute blast of chaotic noise; a mash of throat-straining screeches and crackling guitar. “Plan A” is a statement—this is not the same band that, only two years ago, winnowed their way into the hearts of listeners with a chorus of “It’s you! It’s me! And it’s dancing!”
This is immediately followed by “200-102,” a daringly minimalist instrumental leading into “Straight in at 101.” “101” is a bitter, deeply uncomfortable track chronicling an empty relationship in typically adjective-laden fashion. It hints at the vivid humor that characterized earlier songs—“I think we need more post-coital and less post-rock / Feels like the build up takes forever, but you never get me off”—yet by the end Gareth still finds himself wallowing in a “sense of waste / The indignity, the embarrassment.”
These three consecutive numbers form the beating heart of the band’s new musical philosophy. “Romance is Boring” is a work of literate, deeply emotional rock which treads a careful line between the band’s two primary influences: the raw, noisy, unpredictability of Xiu Xiu and their ilk, and the listenability of early 90s indie pop.
Book-ending the more challenging center of the album are three tracks that cleave closer to the pop sensibility of debut “Hold On Now, Youngster.” Whether they’re the most interesting songs on “Romance is Boring” or not is up for debate, but singles “There Are Listed Buildings” and “Romance is Boring,” as well as blogosphere hit “The Sea is a Good Place To Think of the Future” show the band haven’t lost their touch for delightfully edgy pop songs. The title track in particular will be causing plenty of lost voices at Campesinos! concerts with its rollicking, gleefully tongue-in-cheek chorus of “You’re pouting in your sleep / I’m awake still yawning / We’re proving to each other that romance is boring.”
What is most striking about “Romance is Boring” is how much Los Campesinos! have matured. Instead of shying away from the essential disaffectedness which has always defined their albums, they have embraced it musically as well as lyrically, with a noisy, lo-fi aesthetic which is a natural fit for the band. As they become more comfortable with their new skin, it isn’t hard to imagine Los Campesinos! releasing a truly great noise-pop album. But even this slightly tentative effort doesn’t leave much room for complaint.

Middle-aged women are supposed to love Alice Munro almost as much as they love yogurt.  A serene, poised, white-haired presence on the book jacket, Munro rules over her own world of strong, quiet, older women. She never raises her voice and provides neat little bites of stories that are flavorful without too many calories.
Munro’s stories may be the yogurt of the literary world, but there is a reason yogurt is so popular—it is impossible to truly dislike. At their best, her stories in “Too Much Happiness” are proof that the best writing need not reach for grandeur. However, Munro runs into the inevitable danger of writing within a narrow world, and her stories begin to seem undistinguishable from one another. Instead of presenting readers with a slice of Munro’s world, it starts to feel as if she were reaching out to her target audience and telling them: Here, like this book.
Despite Munro’s clear attempts to move outside her comfort zone—even making one story’s narrator a man—the stories of “Too Much Happiness” still firmly belong in Munro Land. And despite subject matter that includes a fair amount of sex, drugs, and violence, her stories still read with the same quiet calm, so much so that it often takes a couple minutes for the full weight of the subject matter to sink in.
Munro Land is a world of characters that are entirely respectable, but live just out of view of the people we may read about in the newspapers. They aren’t people who are going anywhere in particular. They have picked ordinary professions—woodworking is popular, featured in three of her stories—and retired to small towns in Canada. There, they grapple with the same issues that much more angst-ridden writers labor over—only with less fanfare.
This is an admirable and refreshing way to look at life’s dramas. “Dimensions,” the first story in “Too Much Happiness,” could easily be ripped from the headlines of a tabloid. Nevertheless, Munro manages to tell the story of a woman whose husband has murdered her children as if it were an unexceptional event. Munro includes chilling, yet matter of fact details of the woman’s relationship with her husband such as, “she was even allowed to laugh with him, as long as she wasn’t the one who started the laughing.” There is no place here for tears or court-ordered shrinks. Rather, Munro places much more stock by what the ordinary woman feels.
Munro emphasizes the ordinary to such a degree that the fact that her stories portray the extraordinary almost slips by unnoticed. Though on the surface her women seem to lead predictable lives, the situations they face have a subtle element of the supernatural that is much scarier as a result of how detached her tone remains throughout.
In one scene, a shy college girl goes for dinner at the house of her roommate’s strange benefactor. Upon entering, she is told, “Here is where you leave your clothes.” Without missing a beat Munro writes, “Don’t worry, you won’t be cold. The house is well heated throughout.” Because both lines are uttered in the same casual manner, the expectation for her to strip seems almost as natural as the assumption that she would take off her coat. In moments like this, Munro avoids the clichés of gothic literature by emphasizing that the ordinary is the worst part of the extraordinary.
The first stories in “Too Much Happiness” exhibit Munro’s power at its best. Possibly due to the repetitive nature of her subject matter, her later stories become less and less fresh and she resorts more and more to the formula that she knows cannot fail. She becomes overly romantic about the characters she is describing and can’t help but hide her enthusiasm. Describing the third craftsman we encounter, she says, “He can lie awake nights thinking of a splendid beech he wants to get at, wondering if it will prove as satisfactory as it looks or has some tricks up its sleeve.” Munro is so enthralled with the idea of someone who works with their hands that these characters fail to represent anything more than their profession.
The final and titular story of the book exemplifies this tendency.  It is Munro’s imagining of a short period in the life of an exceptional woman from history: Sophia Kovalevsky, a mathematician and novelist who lived in the late 19th century.  Munro writes that she encountered Sophia’s story in an encyclopedia, and the story begins to read more like a factual entry than anything else. Sophia is a fascinating character and a perfect example of a powerful woman, but by portraying her as a saint, Munro makes this woman less accessible to her readers.
By Munro’s final story, the particular world she is writing about begins to feel real. This can be a comforting thought—who doesn’t want to believe that in every ordinary person is a kernel of resilience and power? It is certainly impressive that she manages to create a portrait in miniature of the world that feels so authentic. But just like yogurt, while one or two can be refreshing, after a whole book of stories, it might be time to get something a little more sustaining.

Borrowing established stories and adapting them for the stage is hardly unusual in today’s theater culture, where original writing is hard to find. It is rare, then, when a production based on another work manages to feel exciting. Perhaps even more remarkable is that the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and Elevator Repair Service (ERS) achieve this freshness with one of the most well known American novels: F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.”
In “Gatz,” a six-hour epic told in two parts at the A.R.T. through February 7, ERS attempts to capture the resonant power of “Gatsby.” The company takes a curious approach: “Gatz” is a performance that consists almost entirely of dialogue, comprised only of the text of the novel. Though the production uses design elements effectively to bring Fitzgerald’s work to life, most of the actors’ performances are unconvincing and flat, a regretful detail that hinders an otherwise brilliant concept.
The reader (Scott Shepherd), who transforms from an everyman office drone into “Gatsby” narrator Nick Carraway, casually begins reading the book on the pretext of waiting for his ancient, uncooperative computer to start up. Despite receiving odd looks from fellow employees, he continues reciting the text aloud. Soon, the play subtly shifts, and each one of the nobody office workers is cast in a role, drafted into the reader’s imaginary Fitzgeraldian world, where the romance, humor, and brutality of “Gatsby” are all poignantly real.
The choice to retain every last syllable of Fitzgerald’s work is a bold one, but it pays off. Rather than becoming a sort of story time for adults, “Gatz” instead challenges the audience to reconsider familiar prose by framing it in a novel context.
Suddenly, Nick’s wry observations are funny. Often relegated to high school English reading lists, “Gatsby” has always been popular—but not necessarily understood. What is inevitably lost in the commotion of the American dream, unrequited love, and two tragic deaths is Fitzgerald’s humor. Shepherd manages to draw out the wit and sarcasm of the narrator, capitalizing on dramatic pauses and pointed glances at the audience. As he reads Fitzgerald’s exposition aloud, his earnest and deadpan drawl meshes well with the reflective musings of Midwesterner Nick, and Shepherd is instantly likeable—a necessary quality for an actor who will be speaking nearly non-stop for six hours.
Where Nick is a detached observer in the novel, Shepherd’s narrator is the centerpiece of the production. Although Shepherd has the novel memorized, his intentionally stilted delivery—as if he really is reading “Gatsby” out loud for the first time—never betrays this feat until the end of the second half, in which he goes off-book for nearly an hour.
What is most remarkable about Shepherd, however, is not his memory, but his ability to evoke such complex emotion—he never forgets his performance in the mass of complicated text he must deliver. Even when his personality flashes from Nick to office worker, his seemingly inconsequential gestures are nuanced and deliberate. Shepherd looks continuously at a clock throughout the play, a tic that reveals its portentous significance when Nick recounts the timeline of Gatsby’s death. Shepherd’s skillful handling of his role is an accomplishment that dwarfs the rest of the company by comparison.
Victoria Vazquez’s Daisy is passable and unmemorable. Vazquez never quite embodies the calculated superficiality of Daisy, and instead appears artificially blank. Her attempt to capture the manipulative schoolgirl tendencies that make Daisy so dangerous and so repulsive seems immature.
Indeed, the tension between Vasquez and Jim Fletcher, who has a commanding, albeit one-dimensional presence as Gatsby, is similarly underdeveloped—a fact most evident in a critical scene when all the major characters are gathered together in a hotel room, and Tom Buchanan (Gary Wilmes) finally realizes that Daisy loves Gatsby. The actors are helped tremendously by smart blocking—Jordan Baker and Nick, like spectators, face a triangle formed by the aforementioned trio—yet Vasquez fails to translate her torn anguish, Fletcher his overwhelming yearning, or Wilmes his bridled fury.
Only Vin Knight stands out from the ensemble in his various roles. His Owl Eyes in particular adds a certain charm to the party at Gatsby’s house, and his reappearance near the end of the play provides touching levity.
“Gatz” tears “Gatsby” out of the Jazz Age and situates its characters in a dreary office that could easily serve as the set of Samuel Beckett’s bleak “Endgame.” Yet these surroundings emphasize the mainstay of Fitzgerald’s work. As the play progresses, and the narrator comes to realize the careless arrogance that defines Daisy, Tom, and Jordan, the backdrop remains a stark foreshadowing of what lies beneath the lavish glamour of these characters. Stripped of their displays of wealth, the three characters are as cold and unfeeling as the world ERS has created around them. As the set reminds us, even Gatsby has clung so desperately to a passionate dream that will never exist, that the American dream he actually has achieved cannot disguise the empty futility of his romantic ambition.
While attention is focused primarily on the text and performers, these are frequently undermined by the seemingly constant soundscape of city traffic and chirping birds—an obvious attempt at technical verisimilitude. Even the onstage presence of sound designer and operator Ben Williams, who also plays several small roles throughout the production, is less distracting than the unnecessary and incongruous noise with which the performers must compete. The sound design is thankfully more subdued and sparingly used—to greater effect—in the stronger second half of the production.
Light designer Mark Barton’s work does not suffer from the same problems created by the sound design. Bright lights beautifully convert the dingy office into an extravagant party and, in one magnificently lit scene, the tense hotel room where Tom confronts Gatsby and Daisy about their affair.
Possibly the most significant light appears at the end of the first chapter, when Gatsby reaches for the distant green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. The novel’s enduring symbol of the American dream, the green light is paid homage in a lovely moment in which a backlit Gatsby leaves the office, and a small, single green light is visible on the wall. Though it manages to evoke the sorrow and impossibility of Gatsby’s life, doomed to mortality by his idealistic dream, the moment is far from dispiriting—rather, it serves as an evocative reminder of the expression of hope that unites “Gatz” and “Gatsby.”

Consider the following two films: in the first, a character known for his logical prowess stands before the audience and explains, “When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth,” and proceeds to deduce the unlikely origins of the film’s villain. In the second movie, our hero foils a sinister assassination plot involving large quantities of poison gas, using primarily his fists. Though many would recognize these common cinematic tropes, few would suspect that the first film is J.J. Abrams’s reinvention of “Star Trek,” while the second is Guy Ritchie’s reimagining of “Sherlock Holmes.” This juxtaposition highlights how far these blockbusters have strayed from their source material.
To be fair, this comparison says less about “Star Trek”—in which Spock simply echoes, for the benefit of Trekkies, a line first used in “Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country”—than it does about “Sherlock Holmes.” While the former retains its space ships and lasers, the latter exchanges its sense of mystery in favor of wall-to-wall action.
“Sherlock Holmes” functions more as a nod to the logical bent of Conan Doyle’s series than as a serious portrayal of it. From impossibly large explosions whose implausibility is exceeded only by the number of proximal characters who manage to survive them, to magical African flowers which perform convenient plot functions, this is not a film showcasing mind over matter. On occasion, we witness Holmes’s renowned analytical capabilities, but rarely are these moments integral to the story. Holmes uses his intellect not so much to outwit the villains as to discover their next target, whereupon conflicts are resolved in fantastical action sequences. But none of this is to say that “Sherlock Holmes” is not a good movie —it’s just not one that viewers may be expecting.
As detective-cum-action-hero Holmes, Robert Downey Jr. discovers what many great actors have before him—that one can play essentially the same character in many films, provided that one is entertaining enough to get away with it. In Downey’s case, the intellectually brilliant, heavy-drinking and hard-hitting persona of American arms inventor Tony Stark of “Iron Man” proves surprisingly adaptable to 19th century England. That is to say, all that is needed is a change of accent. This is not a deep role, but a fun one, and Downey recognizes this, delivering lines like “using musical theory, I have created order out of chaos” with just the note of seriousness to make them wholly hilarious.
Jude Law, as Dr. John Watson, Holmes’s trusty sidekick, gives his most memorable performance since 2004’s “Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.” It helps that the writers chose to grant Watson a more active role in the proceedings than he typically takes in the traditional Sherlock Holmes storyline. In fact, there is no “elementary, my dear Watson” moment in this film. Though Holmes is clearly ahead of the intellectual curve, Watson is self-confident and able to hold his own – even more so than Holmes – in the film’s numerous fight scenes.
The supporting cast performs admirably, but they are overshadowed by the crime-solving pair. Mark Strong plays Lord Blackwood, the villain of the piece, a man determined to take over England and who seems to be employing supernatural powers towards that end. Strong is suitably menacing but entirely forgettable, enabling the duo of Watson and Holmes to steal the show with ease. The two leading men are accompanied by two less-than-leading ladies—Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) as Holmes’s former flame and Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly) as Watson’s fiancé—both of whom receive only minimal screen-time in the two hour film. McAdams and Reilly give strong performances that could easily have been explored more extensively, but it’s hard to argue with the choice to let the relationship between Holmes and Watson take center stage.
The ultimate irony of “Sherlock Holmes” is that it is every sort of movie except a mystery. Guy Ritchie’s adaptation of the adventures of the sleuth of Baker Street is by turns a thriller, an action movie, and a comedy—and in each of these, it succeeds. But a truly great film would take its cue from what made Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s series so great—the mind-bending experience of witnessing Sherlock Holmes rewrite the story the audience thought they understood into an entirely new narrative. For now, though, viewers will have to wait for the inevitable sequel to see the great Sherlock Holmes solve an actual case.

Despite the intrusion of post-9/11 themes into the subdued suburban settings of previous Nicholas Sparks film adaptations such as “The Notebook,” “Message in a Bottle,” and “A Walk to Remember,” actors Channing M. Tatum and Amanda M. Seyfried said in a conference call that their upcoming film “Dear John” is still in line with the emotionally moving material at which Sparks excels.
“I really don’t want people thinking that they’re going to go in and have another depressing war movie on their hands,” says Tatum, the star of “Step-Up” and “GI Joe.”
“We tried to take as much of the military out. We didn’t want to see John with a weapon on all the time and slogging through really dangerous places... We really just wanted it to be about two kids falling in love.”
Tatum plays John—a Special Forces member who falls in love with college student Savannah (Seyfried) while on military leave in South Carolina.  The two exchange letters when John is deployed to Afghanistan.
After months of continued  war-time correspondence, Savannah sends a break-up and farewell letter to John—thus lending the movie its title—and forces him to cope with their broken relationship when he returns to his home.
Though the two actors spoke to military personnel and their families to research their roles, Tatum and Seyfried were careful to separate their admiration for the sacrifices made by members of the armed forces from their own portrayals in the movie. Seyfried, whose credits include the HBO series “Big Love” and the movie musical “Mamma Mia!” says, “I recently just met a bunch of women that are literally just hanging and waiting... about 100 families [at Fort Bragg, NC], wives in particular, that were telling me how their husband or fiancé had just been deployed and it’s tough.”
“I really can’t say I understand [their sacrifice] because I don’t think I ever could.  I’m not that brave to go without that connection for that long, but they trust that these are the people that they are meant to be with, so they’ll do anything,” says Seyfried.
While the storyline focusing on the difficulty of maintaining relationships in a time of war may mirror the lives of members of the Armed Forces today, Tatum and Seyfried predict a much larger audience could also relate to the central themes of “Dear John.” Tatum says, “I think we could have taken John out of the military and made him anything else as long as that distance and time was between them and things come down the road that they don’t expect... This is a story [about] two kids in love for the very first time and it’s that first love that you can’t get right.”
Because the war only serves as a backdrop, a plot device which separates the young couple and accelerates the emotional roller coaster of their relationship, the co-stars assert that this narrative of love and loss directly relates to college students.
Though this tale of young pretty people falling in and out of love may be somewhat conventional, Seyfried and Tatum contend that “Dear John” helps to fill a generic deficiency.  “When ‘The Notebook’ came out, people were running to see that movie because I think there’s a real lack of movies like that,” says Tatum.
And though “Dear John” is poised to revive a market which hasn’t been well-saturated in recent years, its timely  themes can appeal to a broader viewership as well.

Boasting a number of famed director Peter Bogdanovich’s most beloved movies, including “Paper Moon,” “The Last Picture Show,” and “What’s Up Doc?,” the Harvard Film Archive’s (HFA) newest series, entitled “Peter Bogdanovich, Between Old and New Hollywood,” explores the director’s penchant for classic Hollywood style. The festival, which began on January 29th and will continue until February 8th, also delves into some of his lesser-known works, including the dislocation-noir “Saint Jack” and his debut feature, “Targets.” HFA will host nine films in total, ranging in genre from slapstick comedy to horror-based thrillers.
According to HFA director Haden Guest, the festival drew its inspiration from another HFA series celebrating John Ford, the director of classic American westerns like “The Searchers.” When analyzing Ford’s influential and inspirational work, the directors of the HFA considered his considerable impact upon Bogdanovich. A devoted cinephile, Bogdanovich venerated Ford and released the tribute “Directed By John Ford” in 1971. After considering the connection between Ford and Bogdanovich, the HFA decided that an exhibition of Bogdanovich’s films would provide a perfect complement to Ford’s wide body of work. As Guest explains, “We called it ‘Between Past and Present’ partly for that reason. Bogdanovich’s cinema references quite clearly classical Hollywood cinema, and at the same time, points forward towards the new Hollywood, which was America’s equivalent of the French New Wave.” The Ford festival will screen twenty-two films at its initial presentation this winter, and forty more movies in the next six months.
In the earlier stages of his career, Bogdanovich served as a film critic for “Esquire,” and also profiled and orchestrated tributes to some of Hollywood’s finest directors, including Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles, as a worker in the Film Department of the Museum of Modern Art. Making his directorial debut in 1968 with “Targets,” Bogdanovich quickly established himself as one of the industry’s brightest new talents. A string of tremendously successful films in the early 1970s, including “The Last Picture Show,” “What’s Up Doc?,” and “Paper Moon,” firmly solidified his place in cinematic history. While not all of his later films matched the tremendous financial success of his previous efforts, Bogdanovich remained a remarkably consistent and vital force in 1970s cinema.
While students may be quick to recognize titles such as “Paper Moon,” known for Tatum O’Neal’s Oscar-winning performance, Guest encourages students to seek out the lesser known works in the collection, especially “Targets” and “Saint Jack.” “Targets” documents the life of a crazed serial killer in a reinvention of the thriller genre. Simultaneously, Bogdanovich presents a parallel story line in which the director himself profiles aging horror film legend Boris Karloff in the twilight of his career. Guest feels that while the sensationalism of the former plot line and the bittersweet sentimentality of the latter may appear diametrically opposed, they nonetheless work together nicely as a tribute to the classic Hollywood style Bogdanovich emulated.
Another undiscovered gem, the Hugh Hefner-produced “Saint Jack,” tells the story of a pimp trying to find his way in Singapore. Guest believes that students will really appreciate the visual style of the film, and while it is a bit over the top at times, “Saint Jack” has an inherent appeal to college students.
Guest considers the upcoming festival to be enormously important in understanding not only the classic cinema of old Hollywood and its stylistic revitalization in the 1970s, but also contemporary cinema. Guest feels that “the 70s continue to be, among young audiences, quite popular. So much of contemporary cinema today is referencing the 70s.” Bogdanovich’s films reinvent many classic genres— the musical, the western and the thriller—still accessible to a younger generation. As a student of popular cinema and an enthusiastic film critic, Bogdanovich reflects his considerable knowledge in his films. Guest says that current Harvard students will find a great deal to appreciate in “Between Old and New Hollywood.” He feels that “in terms of their visual panache, their incredible style, and their sophisticated narratives, I think there’s a lot for younger audiences today.”

The first rule of Fight Club is you don’t talk about Fight Club. But that’s not stopping Professor Richard Wrangham. The biological anthropology professor and co-author of “Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence,” will be appearing at the Coolidge Corner Theatre on February 8th to discuss the 1999 David Fincher film as part of the theater’s ongoing series, “Science on Screen.”
The Coolidge Corner Theatre presents the “Science on Screen” series, in its fifth year, in association with The Museum of Science and New Scientist Magazine. “The aim of the series is to educate about science while entertaining through movies, presenting a feature film or feature-length documentary on a science/medical-related topic,” theatre’s associate director Elizabeth Taylor-Mead said in an email.
“Paired with each screening in unexpected combinations, a top-notch scientist or medical expert provides insights about topics related to the film and shares the latest research on the subject.”
Over the course of their five year history, Taylor-Mead and the Coolidge Corner Theatre have screened such films as “A Clockwork Orange” with a visit from Marc Hauser, a professor in Harvard’s psychology pepartment; “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” with pscychology professor Daniel Schacter; and “2001: A Space Odyssey” with cognitive scientist Marvin L. Minsky ’50.  “Audiences should expect to see a classic or cult feature film or outstanding and hard-to-find documentary, beautifully projected onto the giant silver screen,” says Taylor-Mead. “The pairings between film and world-class scientist or medical researcher are always dynamic and entertaining.”  These components combine into a recipe for success, and the “Science on Screen” series has certainly proven to be a hit.
“We often have audiences lined up out to the parking lot,” says Taylor-Mead. “It’s been very popular because it captures the interest of both film fans and science geeks.”
This month’s feature is the film “Fight Club,” based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The topics addressed by Professor Wrangham in his talk will be the reasons behind male aggression, violence, and fighting—all of which are vividly portrayed in the film.
“Chillingly,” says Wrangham in an email, “‘Fight Club’ treats violence as fun, whether one-on-one conflicts or war-like gang attacks.” Violence, and the motivation underlying it, has been a large part of Professor Wrangham’s research over the past twenty years at Harvard University.  “Wrangham has spent years studying chimpanzee cultures in the wild and comparing those cultures to human ones,” explains Taylor-Mead.
“Based on research in ‘Demonic Males,’ I will discuss why men like to fight, what makes human violence special compared to other primates, and why we are wired to relish tales of aggression,” said Wrangham. “‘Fight Club’ is a classic movie, and my talk may give [audiences] new perspectives.”
According to Taylor-Mead, Professor Wrangham’s appearance at “Science on Screen” will provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to audiences. “At home, audiences won’t get this surprising combination of edu-tainment,” Taylor-Mead explains. “[They’ll get] a private seminar only shared with 400 people sitting together in the dark eating the best popcorn in greater Boston.”

A little more than a month ago, some critics thought “Avatar” was going to bomb—quite a lot of them, in fact. I even felt a little sorry for James Cameron, despite his tens of millions of dollars in personal wealth, and despite the fact that his previous films have become cultural icons, if not cinematic ones. Now that the industry’s pessimism has been mostly forgotten, I’d like to take a moment to imagine a different cultural landscape—one in which “Avatar” flopped, and the branch of the media that has cropped up to comment upon, fawn over, and criticize Hollywood had to find something else to discuss between the end of December and the beginning of Oscar season. Here is a quick recap of all the films and film news you could have watched, discussed, and blogged about this month were it not for a certain attention-hogging space opera.
1. “The Last Station” and “Fish Tank”: Awards season wouldn’t be awards season without a few middlebrow, middle-quality art-house pieces that appear and then subsequently vanish from the Kendall Square Cinema over a few weeks in January. A month typically considered a dumping ground for poor movies, foreign and independent films can sometimes be fairly successful when pitted against the otherwise sparse landscape of January cinema. This year, however, hype over “Avatar” has blinded many to alternative movie-going options, which may or may not be a good thing.
For instance, the publicity surrounding “The Last Station,” a film about Leo Tolstoy’s final days and his relationship with his wife Sofya (played by Helen Mirren) strongly evokes that of “The Queen,” the 2006 drama that also stars Mirren and also focuses on a short period in the life of an aging historical figure. I’m betting “The Last Station” will have a similar cinematic life trajectory as “The Queen,” which was nominated for a slew of Academy Awards and is now unfortunately remembered by virtually no one.
“Fish Tank,” written and directed by Andrea Arnold, also fits neatly into a popular indie template—the raw, documentary-like drama that usually features a supremely unfortunate lead character and the hovering threat of some vague social ailment. Arnold’s iteration follows fifteen-year-old Mia, a lonely British girl who develops a close relationship with her stepfather, who then sexually abuses her. Although this genre has often produced forgettable films, the accolades “Fish Tank” has received for its acting and writing suggest that it might be worth checking out before it fades into independent cinema obscurity.
2. The Third Dimension: Critics have shown “Avatar” remarkable lenience because of the perception that it will kickstart the 3-D segment of the film market, which up until now has been remained marginal, despite being populated by lucrative-but-questionable gems such as “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen” and “My Bloody Valentine 3-D.” It’s true that Cameron managed to force the design and adoption of certain technologies a few years before they might otherwise have been picked up. However, three-dimensional films are currently the industry’s best hope to recover revenues lost to piracy, and the 3-D successes of “Coraline” and “Up” ensured that 2009 would still have been considered a great year for the technology. Regardless of the success of “Avatar,” 3-D would still be relevant, and the accumulation of minor successes for the medium would have resulted in the same advances in a few years that “Avatar” has facilitated now.
3. Éric Rohmer and Erich W. Segal’59: While critics and bloggers were busy debating the possible racist connotations of “Avatar” verses its technological implications, the death of some influential film figures went relatively unnoticed. One of the seminal directors of the French New Wave, Éric Rohmer, passed away on January 11, leaving behind a large body of films, many of which were organized in series around common problems of morality and relationships. If you share the conviction of Gene Hackman’s character in “Night Moves” that a Rohmer film is “kind of like watching paint dry,” you might do better to pay your respects to Segal, who died on January 17. During his career he taught at Harvard as well as Oxford, Princeton, and Yale; however, his scholarly work on classics and the history of comedy was overshadowed in the popular consciousness by his screenplay for the popular 1970 film about a dramatic Harvard romance, “Love Story.”
4. “The White Ribbon:” Just kidding. With or without “Avatar,” no one really would really care about Michael Haneke’s allegorical drama, although it might well be the best film of the year. Another one to watch for in February is “A Prophet,” Haneke’s equally dreary, equally subtitled competition for critically-anointed, unseen European film of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Race needs to be talked about openly and immediately. That’s the straightforward message of Code Switch 7, a brand-new theater company founded by the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) seven African American students: Renee-Marie Brewster, Anthony Gaskins, Kelley Green, Faith O. Imafedon ’07, Richard Scott, Charles Settles, and Lindsay Strachan. Under the mentorship of Professor Robert Scanlan, they will be performing their debut show at 2pm on Sunday, February 7 at Club Oberon.
A multi-perspectival look at what it means for each one of them to be black, the show consists of completely original work that includes rap, gospel, and dance, as well as more traditional forms of theater—but above all, it’s intended as a cathartic entry to a dialogue with an audience that Code Switch 7 feel is long overdue.
“My first observation was that there was not a thing in common among these people apart from race,” remarks Scanlan on first meeting the students, Yet one of the main missions of Code Switch 7 is to evoke the individual—and highly personal—matter of dealing with racial issues. The common experience of being black at the A.R.T. provided them with an initial starting point. “It’s really isolating, because our class is very homogenous and we’re such a minority,” Brewster says.
This is where the idea of “code switching” comes in, a concept that forms one of the central building blocks of their upcoming performance. Code switching is a technical term used in vocal coaching that refers to switching between dialects. Here, the term applies to how people change the way they talk in various social environments. “This would specifically reference how your switch happens when you’re black and navigating different situations,” Strachan explains.
“In the case of being an African American, it’s like, how black am I allowed to be?” Scanlan asks. This is an issue that black actors constantly have to confront—the Sevens and Scanlan even joked about having a Black-O-Meter in their pieces that would register how ‘black’ a given piece is on a scale.
“When you’re being cast and getting ready for the industry, there is a clear divide, a clear difference, and race has a lot to do with it,” Settles explains. According to the group, the casting process is generally not racist, but being African American will inevitably cause an audience to perceive a character differently, even when the intent of the actor remains the same. As Green says, “We’re going to be faced with, ‘I’d love to do this show but I can’t,’ or, ‘I could totally do that role but I visually cannot.’”
In an industry dominated by the outside perception of an actor, Code Switch 7 envision themselves sparking a very personal conversation about being black in their original pieces. Some, like Settles, use music: he is incorporating part of a gospel song, “Trouble in My Way,” into his piece in order to talk about his own experience of black spirituality while growing up in Jersey City.
Others, like Imafidon, will deliver provocative and fun monologues. One of her pieces is centered on relationships and her fascination with biracial couples. “I was thinking about my body and black bodies,” Imafidon says. “I wanted to play with black fetishes by looking at them through a white person’s eyes, and then I thought, how about if I talk about my own fetish? How about if I talk about my white man fetish?”
The rise of Code Switch 7 is an experiment—not just in terms of their message, but also in terms of trying to get a budding theater company off the ground. Scanlan is outlining an infrastructure in which independent student theater companies with developed projects could begin to take off, benefiting from the expertise of the many producers and technicians running Harvard’s performance venues. Scanlan views the new Club Oberon space as one with great potential for Harvard theater troupes. He and the Sevens hope that their company will continue to write, invent, and perform long after they have left the A.R.T., providing a successful model for other aspiring companies to follow.
If the company’s debut performance shocks or offends, that’s also part of the process. “If you’re really excited, come,” Green says. “If you’re apprehensive about it, and you don’t really want to listen, and you don’t really want to share, come anyway, because some of us in the cast are feeling that way too. If you are kind of on the fence, come. See it. You’re going to be sharing the same experiences with us on stage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Outside the classroom, Harvard seems like fertile ground for artistic growth. The campus boasts 120 extracurricular arts associations, from the Harvard Klezmer Band to the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers. But inside the classroom, fields of creativity can sometimes lie fallow. Most courses in the arts keep a safe theoretical distance from artistic production, and thus fail to provide students with a practical understanding of their disciplines. Hands-on courses—including courses in Visual and Environmental Studies or Creative Writing—often require previous experience and applications.
To investigate the role of the arts in academic life at Harvard, President Drew Faust commissioned a Task Force on the Arts late in 2007. Just over a year ago the Task Force produced a detailed itinerary for integrating the arts into the university’s curriculum. Although the Task Force Report has had minimal concrete impact thus far, the administration’s open support for the arts has caused a wave of optimism among the student body.
PUTTING ART IN ACTION
“[President Faust’s Arts Task Force] definitely had a large psychological influence on the company,” said James C. Fuller ‘10, former director of the Harvard Ballet Company. “One of the reasons we felt inspired and encouraged to take on the bigger space [i.e. the Loeb Mainstage for “Momentum,”] was because of the statement of confidence in the arts by the Task Force and the Harvard administration.”
Others in the Harvard Arts community share this sentiment, including Alissa E. Schapiro, ‘10, the co-director of the Harvard Art Show—an organization that provides students with a venue to display and sell their artwork. In a leadership luncheon led by the Office for the Arts (OFA) and Dean Evelyn Hammonds last year, the Dean commented that there was no venue for student artists to sell their work.
“We realized it was kind of crazy that we didn’t have this,” said Schapiro.  “The Task Force on the Arts was really a catalyst for us because we realized there was a void on campus for student artists to sell their work.” At the Harvard Art Show, students from all sectors of the university could exhibit their talents.
“Everyone from VES to music, to anthropology to art history, you name it, we had someone represented [in the show],” said Schapiro.
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
However, the Task Force on the Arts has done more than just inspire. Just as the Harvard Art Show strives to unite artists from all disciplines, the Task Force hoped to expose more students to the practice of the arts within the General Education curriculum.  Its overall mission, “To make the arts an integral part of the cognitive life of the university,” as stated in its report, emphasizes the assimilation of the arts into various academic disciplines.
To carry out this ambitious vision, the Task Force created the Harvard University Committee on the Arts (HUCA), which oversees, revises, and prioritizes its original short-term and long-term goals. One of these goals is to encourage a great range of artistic expression.
“Student participation is not equal across all of the arts. A lot more students, for example, are engaged in the musical arts than in the visual arts. Our mission is to enhance student experience across the board,” said Professor Robin Kelsey, the Chair of HUCA and Shirley Carter Burden Professor of Photography.
Kelsey believes that attention drawn to the arts will not detract from other areas of study.
“I don’t see it as arts against the sciences,” he added. “Fostering collaboration is crucial. A huge amount of support for the arts has actually come from the sciences. When you think about it, there’s a lot of tinkering with materials and making in the sciences that is more analogous to art practice than, say, writing a humanities paper.”
As one of its main goals, HUCA plans to add more General Education courses that make the practice of art a manageable enterprise for all undergraduates. Kelsey’s own Culture and Belief 30 course Photography and Society, offered last fall assigned a final project that required students to make their own photography series inspired by photographers like Eadweard Muybridge.
FROM CRAFT TO CAREER
For those more serious about the arts, departments like Visual and Environmental Studies, Dramatic Arts, and Music already offer classes that incorporate high-level performance into the coursework.
“Dance is definitely finding a place in the curriculum,” said Fuller.  “I’ve been very happy with the dance classes so far, and I hope these courses continue under reform.” Fuller is taking his third Dramatic Arts class, The Alvin Ailey Legacy: A Celebration of the African-American Heritage and the Modern Dance Tradition. In the course catalog, the class is offered to “experienced dancers only.”
The Music department also offers some performance-based classes, such as a chamber music course and Dr. William Bares’ new Jazz Improvisation course. Both of these courses are centered on creating art for credit, an endeavor that the Task Force strove to promote.
The Task Force also aimed to establish springboards for careers in the arts by creating a Master’s of Fine Arts program for visual artists and a Dramatic Arts concentration. But for the moment, Dramatic Arts has been relegated to secondary field status. The prospects of having a Dramatic Arts concentration may be exciting for Hollywood hopefuls, but others have expressed unease with the monopolistic effect it may have on the campus theater scene.
“There are things that I’m concerned about,” said Elizabeth J. Krane ‘11, president of the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club. “One of the beauties of HRDC is that you don’t have to be a Dramatic Arts concentrator. That’s one of the reasons why I came to Harvard as opposed to a drama school. Here, anyone can perform and also pursue their other passions.  I’m also potentially concerned about the graduate school because the resources that we have might go there for those concentrators who will need to do it for credit.”
MAKE IT RAIN
In the meantime, the University’s funding for the arts remains surprisingly intact. Despite university-wide budget cuts, the Office for the Arts has managed to maintain the grants and fellowships that fund students’ artistic ventures. At the moment, Harvard students enjoy support from Artist Development Fellowships, Music Lesson Subsidies, and OFA Project Grants.
“The pace of the Task Force has slowed because of the economical situation, but our modes of financial support for the arts did not get cut,” said Jack Megan, Director of the OFA. “We were not able to increase them, obviously, but to keep [funding] programs fully intact is pretty remarkable.”
Thus considerable support exists for artistically inclined students, and the Task Force has laid down the groundwork for slow but effective expansion of this trove of resources. But its endeavors rely on student engagement as much as the administration’s initiative.
“In this bad economy, we’re looking for where the university can get the most bang for its buck. This means thinking about resources that are not strictly financial. For example, the richest resource we have is the intelligence and energy of our students,” said Kelsey. “If we are to realize the dream of the Task Force, we need the students’ involvement.”

Waived Application Fee! No Required Essay! Priority Scholarship Considerations! Quick Admission Decision!” These are not the spectacular exclamations of the newest credit card offer or online university. On the contrary, these advertisements are emblazoned on the front of University of the Pacific’s Distinctive Candidate Application. These garishly-colored papers comprise one of 30,000 such mailings sent out to high school seniors, offering students the opportunity to apply to college using a pre-filled application that doesn’t require an essay or candidate profile—just a signature. This method of applying to institutions of higher education is disturbingly detached and requires little introspection or effort on the part of students.
The traditional college admissions process impels students to self-reflect, one of the most important benefits of the often-harrowing experience. Students are given the chance to mull over their last four years of high school, discover a cohesive thread in their academic experience, and refine their interests and goals for the future. For many high school seniors, this is the first time in their lives that they have no choice but to ask themselves the question: “Who am I?”
Reducing the application to a mere signature likens the process to applying for a credit card. It eliminates the introspective experience, since students need not think about who they are or which colleges match their needs best. When universities simplify the application down to checking a box, students will naturally invest less in the college search process. The types of social opportunities, academic resources, or extracurricular activities at a particular institution become less relevant to an applicant, increasing the likelihood that they will apply to colleges where they simply will not thrive. Similarly, a signature alone does not provide colleges with the kind of information they need about a candidate to determine whether that individual will be a good fit for the school. This watered-down procedure treats students like potential consumers, not budding collegians.
However, there are certainly aspects of this new development that deserve praise. The mailings provide colleges with a novel new form of advertising, exposing students to institutions they might have otherwise ignored. Bright students might discover that great universities are not found only on the front page of U.S. News and World Report; as a result, lesser-known schools could attract more intellectually gifted students who might otherwise base college decisions on name recognition alone. Similarly, waiving the application fee attracts students who find the cost of applying to college prohibitively high, which increases the accessibility of higher education.
While the intentions behind this method of advertising colleges to students may have been laudable, the new tactic’s negative effects are troubling. Universities should strive to strike a middle ground between attracting applicants and maintaining the process of self-discovery endemic to the applicant experience. Rather than transforming college applications into a mindless chore, each school can opt to send outstanding candidates personal messages explaining that fees have been waived because the college has a particular interest in those particular students.
Regardless of how institutions choose to attract applicants, they must make the preservation of the introspective experience a priority. When applying to college requires as much thought as claiming a “Free trip to the Bahamas for two!” both universities and applicants suffer.

In the competitive world of international corporations, a motto like “Don’t be evil” can be hard to stand by. Remarkably, Google has managed to succeed in its efforts to be good by threatening to withdraw operations from China due to concerns over the Chinese government’s policy of internet censorship.
On Jan. 12, Google reported evidence of efforts to hack into the accounts of many users associated with human rights groups. Citing the fact that the attacks were traced to Chinese sources, Google announced that it would no longer honor its agreement with the Chinese government to filter sites from its search engine and was even prepared to leave its offices in China.
That Google would even consider pulling out of a burgeoning and potentially very lucrative market out of moral concerns is impressive in many respects. Although Google’s 30.1 percent share of the Chinese search engine market is relatively paltry compared to the 63.9 percent share held by China’s homegrown Baidu, withdrawing from the country altogether represents a very serious business decision for the company.
As a large and highly visible multinational corporation, Google has set an admirable example by risking financial loss in order to fulfill what it sees as its moral responsibilities. We hope that other major U.S. corporations in China—such as Microsoft, which has so far commented negatively on Google’s decision—will consider following Google’s lead.
Google’s stand marks an interesting development in U.S.-China relations. It is rather difficult for the U.S. government to criticize the actions of another government, especially one with which it seeks to build important economic relationships. Moreover, reprimanding the Chinese government for violating human rights comes off as high-handed and hypocritical given the deplorable treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib. By acting independently and without any association with the U.S. government, Google was able to make a very effective statement without any sort of political baggage.
Of course, nobody expects China to suddenly see the error of its ways and liberalize completely just because Google decides to check out. Yet there may still be tangible ways in which Google’s departure could make a big impact on Chinese society. It is all too easy to underestimate how much Chinese citizens actually know about the doings of their government, and Google’s disagreement with internet censorship will not go unnoticed, even if government officials continue to insist that there is open internet in China. Google’s actions therefore could help bolster human rights causes in China by bringing such issues to the forefront of people’s minds.
Moreover, from an economic standpoint, should Google be forced to leave China, its departure may raise discontent among Chinese consumers who desire Google products and cause them to direct their anger at the government for driving the company away. Such a development would not necessarily cause monumental change in the government’s policies, but it would be a step in the right direction.
At the very least, the enormous media coverage and popular discussion generated by the Google-China dispute is in itself doing a good thing by drawing attention to human rights issues in China. China’s disrespect for human rights clearly isn’t a concern that will be swept under the rug any time soon.

Thomas Jefferson, one of America’s most widely read forefathers wrote, “The best government is the government that governs least.” What Jefferson intended was for a system of self-regulating government. The financial crises on Wall Street and Main Street in late 2008 exposed the fissures of this political philosophy. The abject lack of oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Bush administration, and Wall Street executives resulted in a full-blown recession and difficult financial times for all Americans.
But rather than accepting the blame, on Wall Street today; it is President Obama who is public enemy number one. Quite a few executives and high-ranking government officials have targeted the Obama administration’s involvement in the banking industry and in the auto industry as hurting, rather than helping, the economy’s recovery. According to them, the markets should self-regulate à la Adam Smith’s “invisible hand.” President Obama, owing mostly to his modest roots and his adoption of the philosophy that government has a place in preventing people from exploiting each other has been the visible hand that is regulating the excesses of Wall Street. However, far from decrying this, both Wall Street and the American people should be grateful for Obama’s expansive view of the government’s responsibilities.
In 2001, the collapse of Enron should have been a trigger to those involved in business in America, the American government, and the American populace that there ought to be fundamental changes in the general practices of American industries, such as how liabilities and assets are calculated. It wasn’t—and those who have benefited from the Enron-led train of unscrupulous practices of the market—such as short-selling, betting against the market or hoping it will fail so that you can make money selling for high to buy at very low. or profiting from a fall in stock prices, insider trading, and mark-to-market accounting, or pricing assets at a higher value than they are actually worth—now unfairly criticize the president and his administration for being an interventionist one. Those on Main Street should realize this and rise up and defend this government which is only looking out for the people’s interests, a rarity these days.
A healthy dose of guarded capitalism is what America needs. Obama’s proposals, one of which is a $33 billion-dollar business tax credit, will shore up many failing small businesses in America’s heartland by providing a tax credit for each net hire by a small business. That, in addition to good labor incentivization practices, innovative ideas by talented workers, and moderate compensation packages for top executives and employees, promise to be the remedies for this ill economy. Unless middle-class Americans fight back against the excesses of Wall Street executives who make more in a day than some of their employees make in a year (for much harder work), they will continue to be exploited by irresponsible financial practices.
President Obama has always claimed to be a student of history and Malcolm X, one of past America’s most aggressive advocate for justice and fairness once said that history is best qualified to reward our research. In this case, unless we learn from history and do an about-face when it comes to regulating our banking industry and start trusting our government to fight for our basic interests, then both our generation and posterity will suffer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Carrie Fisher, better known to the metal-bikini enthusiasts among us as Princess Leia of Star Wars fame, writes in her recent memoir “Wishful Drinking” about her experience and struggles with drug use and bipolar disorder. One of the most memorable parts of the book happens around page 10, when Fisher first learns that bipolar disorder is the reason why most of her adult life has been so, as she puts it, “f*cked up.” The doctor, upon breaking the news, easily rattles off a list of other famous and brilliant people who also suffered from a combination of alcohol and mental disorders, including Ernest Hemingway, Sylvia Plath, Cole Porter, Yves St. Laurent, and Vivien Leigh. Add these names to a more general list of brilliant people with mental disorders, including Winston Churchill, Virginia Woolf, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Isaac Newton, and one starts to get the sense that one has to be insane in order to truly accomplish anything great.
Perhaps one does need to be mad to be a genius. But very few people, especially at a school like Harvard, are willing to admit that they’re not perfect. And many of us are prime targets for depression and eating disorders; we are high-achieving students at a high-pressure institution, prone to scathing self-criticism and inflated expectations.
We should not be in denial of our problems, especially if those problems can be chronically or fatally harmful. We certainly should not feel ashamed to seek help; we absolutely should not be made to feel inept when we do so. Harvard offers an abundance of mental health services, but it should do more to make its students feel confident and comfortable using these services.
True depressive, eating, and anxiety disorders are to be treated neither lightly nor as a means to an end of greatness. Depression can kill. Anorexia does kill. To its credit, Harvard seems to be aware of these dangers. There are many student and professional mental health groups here on campus waiting eagerly to help us if and when we need them.
And therapy is a good thing. There is an abundance of studies professing the positive effects of therapy on depression. Depression can get better by itself, but according to one study done in 1999, adolescents who received cognitive treatment for their depression had a 67 percent recovery rate, as opposed to a 48 percent recovery rate for those who received none. Numerous studies have examined the treatments for anorexia and eating disorders, including one done in 2003, which suggested that those who received therapy for anorexia nervosa had significantly higher recovery rates than those who did not.
These numbers are not trivial. Therapy has a real, beneficial effect. Harvard knows this and is trying to make us aware of it with numerous mental health days and free dining hall-based depression screenings throughout the year. But in our world, where the person sitting next to us in Lamont is just as stressed as we are, the idea of seeking help can appear as sign of weakness to our peers, a sign that we just “can’t hack it.” Many students who are suffering in silence do so because they’ve decided it’s better to contemplate suicide than to be looked at askance by their roommate for visiting a therapist. There’s something very wrong with this picture.
Harvard and University Health Services can counter the stigma many students feel by gently emphasizing during their yearly campaigns that these disorders are increasingly common, increasingly treatable, and most importantly, people want to help you overcome these problems. UHS has services to cater to every issue, including individual and group counseling sessions, as well as many weekly mental and physical health seminars given by various doctors of both the M.D. and Ph.D variety. These programs are excellent but hardly ever heard about. Peer counseling groups may do well to make their presence better felt by holding information sessions or other open house events in the houses, doing more active recruiting, and just generally making a bit more noise around campus. Better publicity never hurts. Those 8 1/2 by 11 flyers are colorful, but they get ruined quickly and are covered up by Collegium posters and Insitute of Politics forum adverts. In all cases, it must be better stressed that seemingly normal people, perhaps even that person next to you in Lamont, have used these resources and have benefited from them. If you need it, you should not be afraid to do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard isn’t just going through a financial crisis. Harvard is also going through an identity crisis.
There are two versions of Harvard that the current Harvard is trying to reconcile. One Harvard is the Old Harvard. The Old Harvard was good. It was the Harvard of the Core Curriculum, exams after winter break, incredible prestige, great wealth, and easy spending. Sure, it had its problems, but the Old Harvard was in no rush to fix them.
The other Harvard is the New Harvard. The New Harvard hopes to achieve unified schedules that make cross-registration between the College and graduateschools easy, to host J-term on campus, and to initiate a more relevant General Education program. The New Harvard aims to enrich the overall experience of the diverse group of undergraduates it recruits through a remarkable financial aid program.
But right now, Harvard is in limbo. Harvard has no identity, and its undergraduates are suffering as a result. What the Harvard administration should learn from these growing pains is that progressing slowly—as they did in the Old Harvard—does have long-term negative effects. The slow shift from the Core Curriculum to the General Education program, the renovations of the Houses and Allston, and the failed implementation of J-term are all evidence of this fact. To improve the undergraduate experience in the future, Harvard must accelerate these sorts of initiatives.
For example, rather than expediting the process by which undergrads can enroll in Gen Ed classes, Harvard has stifled it. Since not all Core courses count for Gen Ed, many current sophomores took Core classes last year that may not count toward Gen Ed requirements. Harvard should have automatically approved Core classes for Gen Ed. Doing so would have increased the number of students fulfilling the new requirements, which we are moving to precisely because Harvard believes they are better. All Gen Ed classes count for Core credit, and it should work the other way, as well. Additionally, Harvard students need stronger Gen Ed advising to help them see what makes Gen Ed unique better than the Core, and to aid them in their choice between these two curricula.
Of course, financial constraints have also affected the Harvard undergraduate academic experience. Section sizes have not risen above the official limits Harvard has laid out for itself, but they have still increased. Section quality steadily decreases with each additional student, so students suffer from increased section sizes regardless of whether they are below Harvard’s section-size cap.
The financial crisis has contributed not only to a diminished academic experience, but also to the failed J-term launch. If the administration had quickly established J-term once it had decided it wanted one, Harvard could have set aside funds for this initiative beforehand, and perhaps Harvard wouldn’t have had to forgo J-term programming this year. Additionally, rather than helping undergraduates maximize their January spent off campus, Harvard resources—such as the Office of Career Services—failed to provide meaningful information about potential J-term internships with alumni until it was too late. OCS and the Harvard Alumni Association sent an email about “Leveraging the Alumni Network” in mid-December. This email should have been sent in September, not a few weeks before J-term started, when students had already made their plans to go home.
To improve the current academic experience in this tough financial climate, Harvard should act on low-cost plans and tap into currently underutilized resources. For instance, the unified schedule was supposed to make cross-registration between the various graduate schools easier. Harvard should encourage this sort of activity with improved academic advising on cross-registration and expanded opportunities for it. Additionally, faculty hiring is frozen, and many professors are taking early retirement or have left for Washington. Thus, professors should be expected to teach more classes to soften the blow from lost courses, like the Economics Department’s junior seminars, until faculty levels return to normal. Professors are the best resources that undergraduates have, and as long as we still have enough faculty-taught courses to meet demand, undergraduates will leave Harvard with an incredible education.
Will I ever be on campus for J-term? When will terminated course offerings be restored? The current Harvard administration has failed to answer these questions. Although I applaud Harvard’s efforts to maintain its stellar financial aid throughout these difficult times, I have to wonder: Will we ever get to New Harvard?

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has cut down its deficit to $80 million, which amounts to a $30 million decrease since FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced in September that the University’s largest school had cut half of its projected deficit, according to a high-ranking FAS administrator.
Smith said in a November interview with The Crimson that he would be releasing the most recent budget figure at today’s Faculty meeting, which marks the first gathering of the Faculty in the calendar year and the first meeting held in the budgeting process for the next academic year.
At an open forum last September, Smith announced that FAS had closed half of its two-year $220 million budgetary gap, noting that the administration would aim to slash another $20 million from the deficit for the fiscal year ending in 2010. But the new figure suggests that the administration has exceeded its expectations.
FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 declined yesterday to comment on updates on the budgetary numbers.
Questions linger regarding the new figure’s effect on the upcoming budgeting process and the breadth and severity of this year’s cost-cutting measures.
In the last academic year, Smith urged FAS departments and administrative units to cut their budgets by 15 percent. The Faculty also underwent a litany of budget-saving measures—such as a temporary freeze on faculty hires, a decrease in funding for food and office supplies, and growing reliance on the work of fewer staffers, after 531 accepted an early retirement package.
“We are pretty much at the bone level,” said Catherine McKenna, chair of the Celtic languages and literatures department, which comprises two faculty members. “But I feel from my conversations with the Dean that it is pretty well understood that there is no fat in this very tiny department.”
Last May, Smith projected a $143 million gap over the next two years. But strategic cost-cutting measures, increased revenue, and anonymous donations helped to bring that figure down to $110 million.
Along with the slew of budget cuts announced in May, Smith announced the creation of six working groups across FAS to produce budgetary recommendations for the upcoming fiscal year.
History of Science Department Chair Anne Harrington, a member of the social sciences working group, said yesterday that she expects Smith will “report a kind of synthesized procedure that has come out of the various working groups.”
Some of the cost-saving measures are ongoing. In November, Smith said that he was seeking to reduce the size of the faculty through attrition, and two months ago FAS offered the first retirement program in the school’s history, enabling more hiring flexibility.
But many of last year’s budget-balancing tactics will likely be one-time measures.
“You can’t not buy new computers when computers break,” said executive administrative director of the department of molecular and cellular biology Susan H. Foster. “There are some things you can get by with for some short period of time but not a long period of time.”

Moira E. Forberg ’11 and Stephen G. Anastos ’11 will lead the College Events Board this upcoming year after winning last night’s elections to become chair and vice-chair, respectively.
“I just think it’s going to be a really great year, and we have some good events lined up that we think the student body is going to appreciate and enjoy,” Forberg said.
In an effort to explore new outlets for smaller-budgeted programming, Forberg and Anastos said the CEB also seeks to improve the board’s traditional major events.
Forberg and Anastos noted that many of this year’s board members are new to the CEB, and both said they hoped that their fresh outlook would expand the group’s programming.
Supplementing the CEB’s three core programs—Yardfest, the Harvard-Yale Pep Rally, and the fall welcome back celebration—is Harvard Thinks Big, a collaboration between the CEB, the Undergraduate Council, and Harvard Undergraduate Television where well-known Harvard professors can speak on a topic of their choosing.
The event is scheduled for Feb. 11.
But while expanded programming is possible, so are reductions, Forberg said, adding that she wasn’t sure whether the Dinner and a Movie events would continue.
Similar events would “certainly” take place, though, since “they’ve been very successful in the past,” she said, adding. “But we don’t want to be tied down.”
The CEB—created in 2006 to take over event planning from the UC—had been allotted $200,000 annually to plan five or six major events.
But due to the financial crisis last year, the College administration instituted sweeping budget cuts, reducing the CEB’s budget.
Though he didn’t anticipate any further cuts in the future, Anastos said the CEB is prepared for the possibility.
“We’ll take the punches as they come,” Anastos said. “I can’t imagine our budget being limited any more.”
Other newly elected executive board members include Kimberly J. Farrell ’11 as secretary, Beau M. Feeny ’13 as publicity director, and Crystal Y. Coser ’12 as recruitment director.
Samson G. Stein ’10 will lead Yardfest, while Robert E.T. Tainsh III ’10-’11 will head the welcome back celebration and Jocelyn G. Karlan ’12  will manage the fall pep rally.

The World Economic Forum’s conference in Davos, Switzerland welcomed unusually large delegations from many universities, including Harvard, which sent a number of senior administrators and well-known professors.
University President Drew G. Faust was joined by Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood, Harvard School of Public Health Dean Julio Frenk, and Graduate School of Design Dean Mohsen Mostafavi at the conference last weekend, which ended on Sunday.
“Harvard is working hard to have a global orientation, which I think is terrific,” Ellwood said. “Davos is one element of that whole process—the presence of three deans and the University President is an indication of how seriously we take our opportunities to expand our global focus.”
This year, Faust resumed traveling in her official capacity as University President after the economic turmoil of the past year subsided. Faust became the first Harvard president to visit the continent of Africa and will also spend spring break in Asia, where the Business School has established its first classroom abroad in Shanghai.
Many professors with various specialties also made an appearance at Davos.
On Friday, Harvard faculty members held their own discussion panel at the conference, focusing on issues in healthcare. Panel members included such notables as Ellwood, Frenk, School of Public Health professor David E. Bloom, Design School professor Toshiko Mori, and Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter, along with Faust.
Donald E. Heller, director of the Center for the Study of Higher Education at Pennsylvania State University, said he noticed that American universities in general—such as MIT, Yale, and Harvard—seemed to have a larger presence at Davos than usual. He attributed     this phenomenon to an overall shift of attentions toward the international community.
Patricia E. Richards, a spokesperson at MIT, also noted that MIT’s faculty presence was larger than usual.
“MIT has been going to Davos since the start of the conference,” Richards said. “It seemed to me that we sent more faculty than we ever have.”
Founded in 1971, the World Economic Forum hosts several conferences every year, including its flagship event in Davos where business political, and academic leaders are invited to discuss pressing global issues. This year, the conference focused on topics such as health care, climate change, and the state of the world economy.
According to Ellwood, the annual conference had a “cautiously optimistic” flavor this year, as world economies appear to have stabilized, but participants remain concerned about the months to come, particularly regarding actions taken by expanding governments.
“There’s a great sense of uncertainty,” Ellwood said.

Shoe-wearing runners have adapted their gait to their footwear, according to a recent study led by Harvard evolutionary biologist Daniel E. Lieberman ’86 and published in Nature magazine.
The study examines how runners coped with the force of collision on their feet before the introduction of the modern running shoe in the 1970s. Comparing habitually barefoot runners with shoe-wearing runners, Lieberman and his fellow researchers found that runners who run with footwear tended to land on their heels, while runners who run barefoot tended to land on the front or middle parts of their feet.
Because humans do not have rigid bodies, only a certain percentage of human body mass—called effective mass—can feel the force of an impact.
According to Lieberman, runners who strike the ground with their heels feel four times as much collisional force as runners who strike the ground on the front or middle parts of their feet.
This difference is due to the rigidity of the ankle when a runner lands vertically.
“It’s a pretty simple idea, basic Newtonian physics: force equals mass times acceleration,” he said.
Lieberman used the dropping of pen on a table as an analogy to illustrate the differences in impact.
“When you drop [the pen] vertically, the whole pen is the mass that comes to a dead stop,” he said. “When you drop it on a 45 degree angle, the collision is much less noisy, because part of the pen’s translational energy is converted to rotational energy.”
In Lieberman’s study, data from the barefoot runners actually came from subjects who habitually ran without shoes. Previous studies on the barefoot running debate did not take into consideration that subjects in the barefoot group habitually ran with shoes as well and therefore were more likely to have a heel strike.
Lieberman said that he was prompted to think about the issue of how barefoot runners were able to run long distance for millions of years without the aid of shoes after he gave a speech before the start of the Boston Marathon. A man who was wearing only duct tape around his socks had insisted on asking Lieberman difficult questions about running.
The duct tape runner, Harvard alumnus Jeffrey T. Ferris ’77, became Lieberman’s first subject.

Many top universities have seen their application totals increase in numbers that range from moderate to dramatic, a jump some counselors have attributed to anxious high school students submitting more college applications.
Harvard received over 30,000 applications for the Class of 2014, a record high that exceeds last year’s total by about five percent.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 credited Harvard’s increase in applications to the University’s generous financial aid, the continuing effects of the elimination of early admissions, and the appeal of the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Many of Harvard’s peer institutions have seen increases as well.
Some saw similar gains—four percent at Dartmouth and five percent at Stanford. Others had more significant jumps—42 percent at the University of Chicago, 20 percent at Brown, 19 percent at Princeton, and 17 percent at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite this trend, Yale University received slightly fewer applications this year—about 25,800 students have applied for Yale’s Class of 2014, compared to 26,000 last year.
University of Chicago News Director Jeremy Manier said that their targeted mailings to prospective students may have contributed to the increase in applications, from 13,564 for the Class of 2013 to 19,306 this year.
For example, students who expressed interest in the arts received a letter about artistic opportunities at the university, and students who attend Jewish day schools were sent a letter from the school’s Hillel.
Susan E. Dean, director of college counseling at Castilleja School in Palo Alto, Calif., attributed the higher application totals seen by top schools to the fact that high school seniors have been applying to more colleges.
According to Dean, this pattern is due to applicants’ financial concerns and students’ reactions to the increasing selectivity of top-tier universities.
“There’s this pernicious media hype, a frenetic pace,” Dean said. “The stories are out there that these schools are becoming more and more selective, so students panic and parents panic.”
She also noted that students who apply to many colleges may be shopping for the best financial aid offer.
Stuart Clutterbuck, a guidance counselor at Bergen County Academies in N.J., said that though he recommends applying to a maximum of ten schools, he did not discourage students who applied to as many as 18 this year.
“These days I’m not really holding the line that much on them, with the cost of school [being so high],” he said. “Apply to more schools, more safety schools that are more likely to give you merit scholarships.”
Yale Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jeffrey Brenzel did not respond to The Crimson’s request for comment regarding why Yale did not see an increase in applications this year, but told the Yale Daily News that these numbers “could just be random.”

A kitchen fire in New Asia Chinese Restaurant triggered an alarm yesterday around 4 p.m., summoning the Cambridge Fire Department and at least four of their fire trucks to the scene.
By 4:30 p.m. yesterday, the fire—which never left the kitchen, according to John Cotter, a deputy with the Cambridge Fire Department—was extinguished, and police officers and firefighters were beginning to leave.
No one was injured in the fire. Additionally, since it started between the restaurant’s lunch and dinner hours, no customers were present during the fire, Cotter said. The restaurant had begun to prepare for dinner when the flames ignited.
One automatic fire-extinguishing system in the kitchen kicked in and began to put out the fire before the fire trucks arrived, Cotter said. Then the fire department “finished it off with the hose line,” he said.
City officials blocked the stretch of Mass. Ave. in front of New Asia while they were combatting the fire.
The kitchen suffered minor damage, but none of the adjacent restaurants were affected by the flames, Cotter said.
Tajine, a Moroccan restaurant that sits next door to New Asia, accumulated some smoke inside. At 4:30 p.m. yesterday, Tajine still had its door propped open to ventilate the inside of the building.
Ali Sati, who owns Tajine, stood inside wearing a jacket and described the temperature inside the building as “freezing.”
But despite the limited amounts of smoke, he said, “Everything is fine, thank god.” He said he was happy with the way the city of Cambridge responded to the problem.
New Asia sits at 1105 Massachusetts Avenue, east of the intersection of Mt. Auburn Street and Mass. Ave. below Dolphin Seafood.
As the fire department began to leave, a pair of onlookers asked this reporter which establishment had been aflame. Outside New Asia, there were few signs that a fire had taken place. Traces of water remained on the sidewalk and the smell of smoke still lingered in the air, but otherwise not much had changed, at least on the outside.
It is unclear when the restaurant will open for business again.

Things went from bad to worse last night for the Harvard men’s hockey team (5-12-3, 5-7-3 ECAC).
The Crimson’s slow start quickly disintegrated into a collective mess by the beginning of the third period in the first round of the 58th Annual Beanpot matchup last night against No. 14 Boston College (14-8-2, 10-6-2 Hockey East).
The Eagles scored three in the final period to rout Harvard by a final score of 6-0.
“It’s obviously very disappointing to our team, especially on such a great national stage,” captain Alex Biega said. “I think quite simply we just got outplayed by the better team tonight.”
The Crimson’s disheartening performance comes after a slight uptrend in the team’s performance in the past few weeks. Harvard notched consecutive wins over ranked opponents, then No.5 Yale, then No.8 Quinnipiac, and then No.13 Union, before falling 2-1 to Princeton on Friday.
“I think we’ve certainly built some positive momentum over the last month,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “You know, this is a tough pill to swallow.”
This year’s dismal performance in the Beanpot sharply contrasts with last year’s first-round result against then-No.1 Boston University. Biega tallied the would-be tying goal moments after the final buzzer, allowing the Terriers to hold on for the win.
In another stark break from recent play, the Crimson was embarrassingly plagued with penalties throughout the course of last night’s game. Prior to this matchup, Harvard averaged just 11.8 penalty minutes per game, the 11th-lowest in the nation.
Yesterday, the Crimson took 17 penalties and spent a total of 58 minutes in the box.
The level of play took a decidedly ugly turn midway through the third. Six penalties were dished out in a two-minute period as players from both teams were thrown into the box for hitting, slashing and hooking.
But Harvard—not BC—was the culprit for the majority of the third period brawls. The Crimson committed ten penalties in that period alone—including three ten-minute majors—killing any attempt at a late comeback.
“When you give a team like [BC] 12 power plays, I don’t like anybody’s chances with that group of forwards they have,” Donato said.
BC got things going early in the first with a power play goal from forward Ben Smith. Eagles forward Brian Gibbons collected the rebound of Steven Whitney’s attempt at goal and took it behind the goal. Gibbons snuck the puck to Smith, who powered the puck into the net from point-blank range to put BC up 1-0.
The Crimson elevated its play to the highest point it would see in the night in the waning minutes of the first. With two minutes left to play, sophomore forward Alex Killorn powered past two Eagles defenders to spark Harvard’s offense to launch four consecutive shots at Eagles netminder John Muse.
“I thought the first 10-12 minutes, they carried the play,” Donato said. “Their speed put us back on our heels but I thought the last six to seven minutes of the first period we had some great chances and Muse came up big.”
Though Muse certainly played a hand in maintaining BC’s first period lead, the Eagles offense took flight immediately at the start of the second. An unguarded BC Matt Price scored for the Eagles just 18 seconds into the period with a hard slapshot over junior goaltender Kyle Richter’s shoulder.
Boston College’s improvement in play and shooting as the game progressed didn’t help the Crimson’s cause either. Chris Keider’s one-timer from the top of the left circle made the game 4-0 and then Carl Sneep’s slapshot from behind the blue line easily navigated its way through the Harvard defense and behind Richter to make the final scoreline 6-0.
“I’d like to give credit to Boston College, clearly the better team tonight,” Donato said. “I think they beat us to all the loose pucks. I think [they] used their speed to force us into taking penalties and I don’t think we gave ourselves a chance to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 58th installment of the Beanpot men’s hockey tournament, Boston College came out with focus. Harvard, on the other hand, looked lost at TD Banknorth, as it was trounced 6-0 by a fast and disciplined Eagles team, ranked 14th in the nation.
The emphatic win by BC was a result of a number of reasons. Skill and speed certainly played a role, but there seemed to be a certain x-factor that separated the play of the Eagles from the play of the Crimson. Self-control, organization—whatever it was—BC had it and Harvard did not.
Although the Crimson faltered, especially in the third period when it gave up three goals, captain Alex Biega did not believe his team was lacking in effort.
“Well, I think with both teams, you can never really question the effort, especially when you’re playing in the Beanpot,” he said.
Whether or not effort was an issue for Harvard, it certainly wasn’t an issue for the Eagles. BC energetically came out of the gates and controlled the tempo of the game’s first ten minutes. To start the second, the Eagles swooped again, scoring less than 20 seconds into the period. The inspired play may have had something to do with a pre-game request by Boston College coach Jerry York
“One of the things we talked about before the game was try to dedicate the game towards someone that influenced your life,” York said. “Whether it was a little league coach...maybe one of your parents...really try to focus on that particular.”
DUDE, WHERE’S MY DISCIPLINE?
While BC played urgent hockey, the Crimson had trouble just staying on the ice. The bench of the Harvard penalty box was kept warm consistently last night. With 17 penalties, which included 10 in the third period and three game misconducts, the Crimson was unable to fill the ice for a comeback attempt.
Towards the end of the game, frustration played a major part in the penalties. But several fouls earlier in the game occurred because Harvard struggled to contain BC’s fast attackers. Overall, a lack of discipline buried the Crimson.
“You take 12 penalties, I think it’s hard to sit here and say that’s a disciplined effort,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91.
At one point, a string of high sticking, hitting after the whistle, slashing, and hooking penalties resulted in three Crimson and three Eagle players sitting in the box at the same time.
Additionally, Harvard defensive lapses played significant roles in a couple of BC goals. On the Eagles’ second goal, the Crimson let an unmarked skater casually attack the goal from the wing. On the game’s third goal, a poor pass in the defensive zone and a slip by junior goaltender Kyle Richter left BC with an open net.
BC and Beanpot History
The six-goal defeat is the most lopsided Beanpot game since 1995-96, when the Boston University Terriers beat Northeastern 11-4. Last night’s loss was Harvard largest Beanpot blowout since an 8-2 loss to BU in 1990-91.
Last season, the Crimson made a stronger showing, dropping a pair of 4-3 nailbiters to BC and the Terriers. Harvard last won the Beanpot title in 1993.
“I think we’re trying to get back to the point where we come into the Beanpot with a real strong record and have a chance to win,” Donato said.
Back on December 9, the Crimson challenged the Eagles, outshooting BC in the third period but ultimately losing 3-2.
Next Monday, Harvard will play the Beanpot Consolation game against Northeastern, who lost 2-1 to Boston University last night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A history of heartbreak at the hands of Boston College has left the Harvard women’s hockey team empty-handed far too often in recent years. Could the 8 p.m. opening round matchup of the 32nd Beanpot finally be the chance the sixth-ranked Crimson (12-5-4, 9-5-2 ECAC) gets revenge?
It all started four years ago when the Eagles (5-13-9, 4-8-4 Hockey East) won their first Beanpot title, defeating Harvard in the process. The rivalry escalated quickly. The very next year, Boston College knocked off the Crimson again in triple overtime at the Eagles’ home rink in the opening round of the Beanpot. Netting the heartbreaker for Boston College was a freshman named Anna McDonald, now Harvard’s sixth leading scorer. The senior gets a chance to turn the tables tonight.
“I’m really excited this year for the Beanpot because it truly will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for me,” McDonald wrote in an email. “I get to come full circle…isn’t that crazy? It’s like a mirror image of the situation, and I feel so lucky to be on this side of the mirror.”
The senior was defeated by her former team last year in the Beanpot finals, a 1-0 loss.
“It’s a big game with bragging rights,” junior forward Kate Buesser said. “A year before I came, we went into three overtimes so it creates some bad blood.”
The rivalry doesn’t look to be cooling anytime soon.
But tonight’s game at the Bright Hockey Center will feature some new faces- notably between the goalposts as both nets feature newcomers with big skates to fill. On the Crimson’s side of the ice is freshman Laura Bellamy, who has been undergoing baptism by fire after a college-career ending injury to senior Christina Kessler forced the rookie into the middle of an ECAC title race.
So far, so good for Bellamy who currently boasts a 1.45 goals against average.
“Laura Bellamy has just been having a great couple of games,” Buesser said. “Knowing we have a good goaltender allows us to…play more aggressively.”
The newcomer’s biggest challenge tonight will likely come from Eagles senior Allie Thunstrom, the team’s leading scorer this season.
“She has a lot of speed and the ability to take advantage of slow defensemen,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said.
Lucky for Bellamy, no one has accused the Crimson defense of being slow.
Meanwhile, Boston College also welcomes a freshman in cage since its previous goaltender, Molly Schaus, is currently competing for the U.S. Olympic team. In the 2007 Beanpot, Schaus set the NCAA record as a freshman for most saves in a game. Unfortunately for the Eagles, Corrine Boyles hasn’t had the immediate success of Bellamy and allowed six goals against a Dartmouth squad that the Harvard freshman held to one in the Crimson’s 4-1 Friday night victory. The Big Green defeated the Eagles 6-3 last Wednesday.
This could lead to a fun night for Buesser, the Crimson’s leading scorer this season with 10 goals and 16 assists.
“We never like to focus on one player,” Buesser said. “You have to get past five players to get that shot…we respect every player on the ice.”
On paper, this looks like the year for Harvard to finally take control of the rivalry. The Crimson enters the game with a better record, the better goaltender, the national ranking, and home ice advantage but as with any rivalry, the game is still brimming with possibilities.
“I think our game plan is to go with a simple three period win,” McDonald said in an email. “Although, if it did have to come down to triple overtime with BC, I can promise you I would pour my heart and soul into getting that goal for Harvard this time.”
And given both team’s penchant for speed, the opening round of the Beanpot should provide no shortage of exciting hockey. There are no sure things in the Beanpot, which has a storied tradition of bringing out the best from the Boston teams look no further than the Crimson’s rivalry with Boston College.
“We like how we’re playing,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Our kids will be ready to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard assistant coach Tracey Leone informed the women’s soccer team yesterday morning that she would be leaving the Crimson this spring for the head coaching position at Northeastern University.
Having spent the past three seasons alongside her husband, Harvard head coach Ray Leone, Tracey Leone helped revive a struggling Crimson soccer program into a back-to-back Ivy League champion.
“It’s an awesome opportunity and we are very excited for her and proud of her,” Ray Leone said. “You can’t blame Northeastern for wanting Tracey, she’s one of the best coaches in the country.”
The first American to win a World Championship as both a player and a head coach, Leone recently completed her 18th year of coaching experience at both the international and collegiate levels. A three-time national champion athlete at North Carolina, Leone has coached Clemson and Arizona State as well as the U.S. National Team.
“We respect [her decision] and we are just so fortunate to have played under her for the last three years,” said junior co-captain Gina Wideroff. “Tracey is one of the best coaches in the country, and she deserves this position. She deserves the world, or the soccer world at least.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a rare opportunity for fans of America’s pastime to pick the brain of one of the great baseball storytellers of the 20th Century, but that’s exactly what a captivated crowd at the First Church of Cambridge Congregational’s Lindsay Chapel had the opportunity to do last Thursday when Hall of Fame sports writer Peter Gammons came to speak.
As the Crimson article notes, Gammons touched on a variety of issues, ranging from steroids to Major League Baseball’s role in Latin America. But Gammons had plenty more to say, and the Back Page has you baseball junkies covered below with extra insight from one of sports journalism’s true pioneers:
ALL THE ‘ROID RAGE
Gammons on allowing steroid users into the Hall of Fame:
“The line that I’ve drawn, is that anyone who tested positive from 2005 on, when there was a policy…[is] disqualified.”
More on steroids:
“I don’t worry about people who were guilty and we never find out…[It is] much worse to be innocent, and be thought by us to be guilty.”
On Barry Bonds’ Hall of Fame chances:
“Bonds is going to be interesting…Next to Ted Williams, he’s the most intelligent person to discuss hitting that I’ve ever met in my life.”
On Roger Clemens:
“I actually think he believes he did nothing.”
On former St. Louis Cardinals slugger and admitted steroid user Mark McGwire, now the Cardinals’ hitting coach:
“He loves to teach. He loves the game. I thought his interview with Bob Costas was too prepared.”
More McGwire:
“Mark is a classic Type A,” Gammons said, relating a story he had hear in which McGwire “ditched one of his girlfriends because she left the orange juice out twice in one week.”
TALKING BASEBALL
On baseball academies in Dominican Republic and other Latin American countries:
“They have these…agents who grab these kids when they’re 10, 12 years old. They don’t play, they just workout. It’s tough to tell when a kid doesn’t play how he got that big and athletic.
On recently departed Red Sox left fielder and new Met Jason Bay:
“He was good in [Boston] because he’s Canadian, he’s a hockey guy. He just skates his wing and nothing bothers him.”
On Red Sox pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka:
“The problem that he has here is that everything he does here is so over-reported in Japan, where he’s a rock star. It’s fascinating to understand how miserable he is in Japan and how happy he is buried somewhere in Brookline.”
On Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer, who is reportedly on the verge of signing a long-term deal with his hometown team:
“He takes being from St. Paul so seriously…He probably will re-sign. He’s by far the most popular athlete in Minnesota.”
On former Red Sox and New York Yankees player Johnny Damon, currently a free agent:
“I’m not sure Johnny’s smart enough to know how much money he lost since he left the Red Sox,” Gammons said, noting Damon’s difficulty in selling his house in Brookline after he joined the Yankees. Gammons related a story in which he jokingly offered to switch houses with Damon and try to sell the house himself. Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter walked by and told Gammons to “stop picking on the animals. [Damon] has no clue.”
On Yankees’ closer Mariano Rivera:
“He’s never won an award, but if you took the Cy Young and MVP of the last 15 years, he’d probably sweep them both…He’s one of the most distinguished people I’ve ever met and I’m old enough that I can compare him to Cary Grant.”

It was just last week that snow fell on Anne Hathaway’s procession down Mass Ave., but now, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals honoree will be announcing this year’s Oscar nominees in sunny Beverly Hills.
An Oscar nominee herself for her performance in 2008's "Rachel Getting Married," Hathaway will be announcing the list from the Samuel Goldwyn Theater at an early morning news conference today.
Hathaway will unveil the nominees in 10 of the 24 categories. In a departure from the traditional five-nominee shortlist, there will be 10 Best Picture nominees this year.
The nominations will be televised at 5:38 a.m. PST, or 8:38 EST. The 82nd Academy Awards, hosted by Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin, will take place on Sunday, Mar. 7, at the Kodak Theatre.

Last night, the Lowell House Committee announced that the reinstatement of their dining hall restrictions would be effective immediately: "Lunch will be open to Lowellians and one guest during all of lunch and until 6:45 at dinner on weekdays and Sundays (this includes brunch)," the e-mail read.
The e-mail explained that these restrictions are in place so that residents can find seats in the dining hall during the weeks of the Lowell House Opera. The HoCo will reconsider these restrictions in March after the Opera leaves.
Great. Lowell has joined the ranks of Adams, Quincy, and the other Houses that have complex rules about who can eat there and when. This means that for the next month or so, the only Houses left open to everybody at anytime except community nights are Cabot, Currier, Pforzheimer, Mather, and Dunster—the Houses too far to walk to in the first place.
HUDS has organized the complicated list of inter-House dining restrictions on their site. But maybe the best strategy to find a place to eat near the Yard is to find yourself some more River house friends.
Or, you could always just go to Hillel.

In case you don’t speak “tweet,” that means that a handful of Harvard professors—including Jeffrey Miron, Gary King, and Niall Ferguson—have Twitter accounts, which just might make them cooler than you. Well, Niall Ferguson was already cooler, but, then again, you’ve known that for awhile.
Anyway, these three professors—who tweet about a range of topics related to their respective areas of expertise—have made the effort to leave the Ivory Tower and communicate with the world beyond the gates of Harvard.
