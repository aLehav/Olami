The man at CVS slid a yellow cardboard envelope across the counter. “Here are your photos. That’ll be $6.51.” I stared at the package. I always developed pictures in high school; why was I so wary to look at these ones? Shouldn’t I be itching to upload them in the hopes of a new profile picture, or something?
 
I had purchased the black and yellow Kodak camera at the beginning of break with the intent of filling its 27 exposures with “memorable moments.” This winter break was the first time I would be able to see all of my high school friends who had since scattered across the country. Clutching the camera in the pharmacy checkout line, I pictured the inevitable encounters it would immortalize: a skyline from someone’s roof, a hugging gaggle of girls, a candid of someone eating at those over-priced diners we used to frequent.
 
At home I had unintentionally slept past noon most days, then groggily combed my hair with my mother’s hairbrush before speeding to the city for yet another lunch date. The meals blended together: asking about university courses over coffee, hearing about a slew of college boys whose romantic abilities seemed firmly placed in middle school while munching on “breakfast for dinner” omelettes, exclaiming for the umpteenth time the utter necessity of visiting each others’ schools over a little illicit wine. Upon each meeting, I would at some point reveal the camera and awkwardly insist on a photo, to which my fellow diners would acquiesce.
 
With my closest friends, however, the camera had seldom left my bag, its exposure count stagnant. After spending multiple days with my best friend Natalie (who happens to share my love of disposable cameras), I remembered to snap only a silly image of her sitting on the floor. While bumming around with a few good guy friends, laughing about parties and people past, capturing a picture of our time together never crossed my mind. I didn’t need to catch up with my closest friends. I received regular complaints about the nastiness of the pizza at their colleges and the surprisingly tasty desserts that sent them running to the gym; updates pertaining to romance were equally unnecessary, given the frequency of mutual consolation over late night calls and texts throughout the year.
 
While at a New Year’s Eve get-together, a friend clicked the shutter and informed me that the camera had taken its 27th and final photo. As we all counted down the seconds to 2013, I pondered the camera and its contents. Most of the pictures featured people I was fond of, but didn’t keep up with when we were away at school. Would I still know the people in the coming year? Two years? Ten? What would happen to these friends? Would I be desperately taking photos of them five New Year’s Eves from now?
 
“Miss? It’s $6.51.” I snapped back to the CVS counter, paid, and left. When I got home and eagerly pulled the pictures out of my bag, I was surprised at how normal they looked. They were, after all, just some shots of people whom I had laughed and cried with during high school, but who I was slowly replacing with others while away at college. I giggled to myself, suddenly unsure as to why I had placed so much salience on 27 poor-quality shots.
 
Yet over the next few days, I found myself flipping through the photos multiple times. As exciting as it had been to leave for another state, a new school, and a different life, my need to document life back at home helped me to reconcile these binary worlds, new and old. The over-exposed, washed out, and red-eyed images would help remind me that I still had a life back in New York—one that had existed for 18 years before my new college world began. I will always be able to reminisce about these New York days when college’s sensory overload feels like too much to bear.
 
I’ll probably continue to buy more disposable cameras, even if my friends laugh (as they are prone to) at my reliance on dinosaur technology. There is a reason our grandmas like to pull out those tiny wallet photos and show off pictures of their grandchildren. Photographs are nice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a strong start to the new year with a win against Bates, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (4-0, 1-0 Ivy) will hit the road to face its toughest tests of the season yet.
The Crimson will travel to take on No. 5 Penn (4-0, 0-0 Ivy) and No. 4 Princeton (3-0, 0-0 Ivy) in a pair of weekend match-ups. The meetings will mark the first time Harvard has competed against a top-five opponent all season. 
“We’ve been looking towards this weekend for weeks now,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “[It’s] probably one of our biggest weekends of the season. The Bates match was really important for us to test ourselves after the holiday break.”
The Crimson had a month-long break over the holidays before heading back to campus earlier this week. Wednesday night’s match against Bates provided an opportunity to shake off any rust in preparation for this weekend’s tough test against conference foes.
“We really just wanted to get back,” Kingshott said. “There’s a difference between drilling, training, and practice, and then really putting yourself on the court in an intense match situation.”
Harvard enters this weekend’s competition with a perfect start to the season intact, having not dropped a single game in any of its top-nine matches.
But the Quakers and the Tigers boast equally spotless records. Both teams have also picked up 9-0 wins against all of their opponents thus far this season.
“Penn and Princeton are two pretty tough competitors,” co-captain Sarah Mumanachit said. “They have really good players in their lineup. It should definitely be a good test, but we are definitely up for the challenge.”
The Crimson edged out both opponents in last year’s match ups, first taking down the Quakers, 7-2. The Tigers proved to be one of the toughest tests of the season, and Harvard squeaked by with a 5-4 victory.
In this season’s go around, the Crimson will look to Amanda Sobhy for a strong start at the number one position. The sophomore made her season debut this week against Bates after being sidelined by injury in the first matches of the year.
Sobhy will face a familiar foe in Julie Cerullo of Princeton. The senior, a first-team All-American, lost to Sobhy in the semifinals of last year’s individual championships. Sobhy went on to win the national title.
But despite Sobhy’s return, Harvard may still have a few of its key players noticeably absent from the court this weekend. Senior Laura Gemmell, a CSA first team All-American, was forced to sit out Wednesday night’s match up and rest an injury. Gemmell started the year with a perfect 2-0 record in the number one slot. Sophomore Julianne Chu has also been sidelined for the first part of the year, but Kingshott says she hopes to make her way back into the lineup soon.
“It’s tough whenever you have such a long season,” Kinghsott said. “Now that we’re in the most intense part, bodies tend to wear down. It’s difficult at this time of the year to balance intense training to push ourselves but [at the same time] not going over the limit.”
The Crimson has been hard at work this past week preparing to face stiff conference competition. Without the usual distractions of schoolwork, the break offers the opportunity to get in some quality practice.
“We came back at the beginning of this week and really hit the ground running with two-a-day practices,” Mumanachit said. “We’re really excited to go on the road this weekend.”
This weekend’s road matches will offer the first glimpse of how Harvard stacks up against some top-tier talent. With both Penn and Princeton vying for the Ivy title, this weekend has the potential to make a defining mark on an already impressive year.
“I think we’ve done incredibly well [so far],” Kingshott said. “It’s a long season, but the spirit everyday at practice is really great. We’re relishing in the fact that, right now, we are about to face some of our toughest opponents. We’re excited for it. This is the arena that we look for, to really push ourselves and see how we measure up against the very best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing its top four scorers from last year’s record season, no one knew how the Harvard men’s basketball team was going to adapt.
Very few people could have predicted the story of the season, a story that—as the Crimson (8-5) enters Ivy League play at Dartmouth (3-10) Saturday—has only just begun. With non-conference play coming to a close, Harvard has seen upset wins, heartbreaking losses, and production from a number of surprising sources, rookies and veterans alike.
“Conference play is always different,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “No matter what opponents you face previously in [your] non-conference schedule—and we’ve had a very difficult non-conference schedule—conference play is always…incredibly challenging.”
While Harvard sits atop the Ivy League based on its non-conference record, conference play changes how teams scout each other and create favorable matchups. As the Crimson prepares to take on each Elite Eight opponent twice, knowing each team’s strengths and weaknesses becomes both easier and more important.
“People know you a lot better and are much more familiar with your style and your players,” Amaker said. “We know we are going to get everyone’s best shot, and we anticipate that this coming weekend.”
Entering the contest, Harvard looks like a team in perpetual transition. While freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and sophomore wing Wes Saunders—with 16.2 and 12.6 points per game, respectively—have anchored the offense all season, their teammates have stepped into a variety of supporting roles as the season has progressed.
Last time out against Rice, junior guard Laurent Rivard posted a season-high 21 points, knocking down five threes. His 44 percent shooting percentage from beyond the arc is good for sixth in the Ivy League.
“It was mostly in the flow in the offense,” Rivard said. “We didn’t really force anything… When other teams don’t focus on me, guys find me.”
The 92-point effort against Rice demonstrated the potential of Harvard’s offense, with five players reaching double digits. Chambers posted his first career double-double with 14 points and 10 assists. The win allowed the Crimson to enter conference play on a high note after splitting its previous two games in California.
“The past three games… we played a lot better than we have this year, with a lot more intensity,” Rivard said.
Coming off an upset win against Cal, the Crimson let its lead against favored Saint Mary’s slip away in the last second despite career performances from Chambers—who was 5-for-5 from deep—and sophomore forward Jonah Travis—who was a force in the paint and posted a season-high 19 points.
“There are a lot of bad things we could take out from [the loss to Saint Mary’s] that we have to work on in practice,” Rivard said. “It’s been a point of emphasis in practice so that something like that doesn’t happen again.”
The Big Green enters the contest having snapped a seven-game losing streak with a win over Army, but the team has struggled to put points on the board. Led by sophomore forward Gabas Maldunas and freshman guard Alex Mitola—with 10.8 and 10.6 points, respectively—Dartmouth has averaged 58.4 points per game, the lowest total in the Ancient Eight.
Despite lacking an offensive sparkplug to put up big points, the Big Green has been able to hold onto the ball. While Harvard has been plagued by turnovers throughout the season as it seeks to define its offensive rhythm, Dartmouth has forced more turnovers than it has given up. The Big Green’s opponents have given up the ball an average of 14.5 times per game. The Crimson has reached double digits in turnovers in 10 of its 13 games, including 17 against Rice.
“We have a lot of growth to do with our younger players,” Amaker said. “I think its obvious to see that there’s a high ceiling there for our team and for a lot of our younger kids.”
Much of this growth will need to come on defense, as the Crimson’s inability to make key stops late in the game has been the difference in difficult matchups throughout the season. In addition to being an offensive leader, Saunders has also begun to step into a more defensive role, taking on the opponent’s biggest offensive threat.
A win for Harvard would be its sixth straight over Dartmouth.
“We always talk about [how] there’s nothing better than winning on the road, and the only thing that is better than that is winning on the road in the league,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a second-place finish in the Ivy League last season, the Harvard women's basketball team will open its conference season on Saturday against Dartmouth after posting one of its best starts since the 1997-98 season.
The Crimson (9-5) will look to extend its win streak against the Big Green (2-12) to six. The Dartmouth squad earned its second victory of the season during its last outing, a win at Massachusetts on Jan. 6, 57-55, snapping a 12-game losing streak in the process. By comparison, Harvard routed the Minutemen four days earlier, 86-59.
“Overall we're just extremely excited to be starting Ivy League play,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “We always open up with Dartmouth and I feel like they'll give us a good game, regardless of their losing streak, because it's Ivy League play and everyone's out there to win.”
The Big Green has been held to just 34.4 percent shooting from the field, sixth in the Ivy League, while Harvard tops the standings at 45 percent.
Dartmouth is led in scoring by captain Faziah Steen. The 5'8” guard has put up 11.2 points per game and has grabbed 24 steals, a team-high. She is second on the team at the charity stripe, having missed just six of her 35 free throws this season.  At least one member of the Crimson squad knows how good Steen can be, as the Detroit native played high school basketball at Detroit Country Day School with Harvard co-captain Emma Golen.
“Me and Faziah go way back—we've known each other since seventh grade and she's a very dangerous player,” Golen said. “She's heated up and gotten in her zone on us in the past so our goal tomorrow is just to try and not to let her get good shots and make everything tough for her.... If she heats up she's very difficult to stop.”
Steen is the only senior on a team with eleven underclassmen on its 14-woman roster. In the backcourt she is joined by sophomore Kamala Thompson and junior Nicola Zimmer. Zimmer has shot 40 percent from behind the arc, a team-high, and leads the squad in assists, with an average of 2.1 per game.
The Big Green frontcourt has been led by sophomores Tia Dawson and Abbey Schmitt. At 6'2” and starting as center, Dawson has dominated the glass, grabbing a team-high 7.6 rebounds per game, and has provided defensive pressure, with 13 blocked shots to show for it. Dawson, who averages 5.2 points per contest, put up a double-double against Massachusetts, her first of the season and seventh of her career, with 12 points and 13 rebounds.
Schmitt, a 6'0” forward who missed her entire freshman season with a torn ACL, is both second on the team in points per game, at 8.9, and rebounds, with 6.7.
Dartmouth and Harvard have had three common non-conference opponents this year: Massachusetts, Holy Cross and Brigham Young. The Crimson defeated all three while the Big Green fell to the latter two.
“As far as Dartmouth goes, that's kind of happened in the past, where they have a weaker out-of-league record but it's always a close game with them,” Golen said. “The Harvard-Dartmouth rivalry is as big as they get. Even though their record isn't the best, it's always a great game with them and they come ready to play.”
In Harvard’s last outing, scoring from junior Christine Clark propelled her team to a win over Rhode Island on Jan. 6, 63-56. Clark recently joined the 1,000-point club during the win over the Minutemen. Against the Rams, Clark contributed a game-high 21 points, four more than her average of 16.6, while senior Victoria Lippert followed with 11, just under her average of 12.6.
Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, the team's third leading scorer, brought down 10 rebounds versus Rhode Island. While her season average is a team-high 7.1 per game, her average over the past five games has been 9.6.
Harvard will seek a third straight win against the Big Green as the team hopes to start conference play on the right foot.
“It's really a big hello to both teams that the Ivy League is here,” Golen said. “It's a fight every night and anyone can win.... We're just excited to get league play started because we know that's what it's all about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You can’t count the Crimson out until the last whistle is blown. On Wednesday, the Harvard men’s hockey team orchestrated one of the finest comebacks in recent memory, coming back from a 5-2 deficit entering the third period to defeat No. 8 Boston University, 6-5, and snap a five-game losing streak.
In light of Harvard’s remarkable upset win, The Back Page takes a look back at some of the most memorable Crimson comebacks of the 21st century—so far.
The Game 2009: Harvard 14, Yale 10
After blanking their opponent for the first three quarters, the Bulldogs were in striking distance of an upset victory. But the Crimson—frustrated by a number of missed opportunities throughout the game—was not prepared to go quietly. With seven minutes left to play, Harvard quarterback Collier Winters found wideout Matt Luft with a 41-yard pass straight down the middle, putting the Crimson on the board and bringing the score to 10-7. Up by three, Yale chose a risky fake punt play on fourth and 22, leading to Harvard gaining possession at the 40. In crunch time, the Crimson would not falter. Winters found wide receiver Chris Lorditch on a 32-yard touchdown toss less than a minute later, cementing Harvard’s eighth win over Yale in nine years.
Baseball 2002: Harvard 13, Brown 12
Down 9-2 in the fifth inning, the game was all but over. Even after battling back to tie the game at 12 in the ninth, the Crimson’s chances of victory seemed slim. With a runner on second and one out, the Bears faced captain Ben Crocket, who was brought in as a reliever after throwing 140 pitches the day before. Crocket, who had limited relief experience, picked up back-to-back strikeouts and brought the Crimson to the plate. That’s when senior first baseman Josh San Salvador—previously sidelined with a partially torn ACL—stepped in, blasting a solo homerun to clinch the walk-off victory and keep the Crimson in the Ivy League title hunt.
Men’s Basketball 2011: Harvard 85, Brown 78
Looking at the score of the February matchup, some might think it was a comfortable win for the Crimson, but the players will tell you a different story. After falling behind by 22 points in the first half, Harvard had nowhere to go but up. In the opening minutes of the second frame, the Crimson’s shots started falling, and dominant performances by Kyle Casey and Keith Wright helped Harvard methodically chip away at the Bears’ lead. The Crimson took the lead for good when Brandyn Curry—who had assisted on the previous play to narrow Brown’s lead to two—nailed a trey, and Harvard never looked back.
Women’s Basketball 2009: Harvard 54, Princeton 50
After dominating Harvard and taking a 34-15 lead by the end of the first half, the Tigers never saw it coming. The Crimson team that took the court in the second very well could have been comprised of entirely different players. Gone were the harried shots, the defensive missteps, and the sloppy ball handling as Harvard crawled back to take a one-point lead with five minutes to play, but the Crimson’s work was not done. The Tigers tied up the score at 50 with under a minute on the clock, but riding Harvard’s newfound momentum, Emma Markley hit a layup to regain the lead and then grabbed a rebound on the Tigers next possession, drawing a foul. Her back-to-back free throws were the icing on the cake.
Women’s Hockey 2005: Harvard 5, Mercyhurst 4
Harvard hadn’t led throughout the entire game, but Nicole Corriero’s game tying goal in the opening seconds of the third period turned this NCAA quarterfinal into a war of attrition. Locked in a 4-4 tie, the Crimson and the Lakers battled through the rest of the third period and two scoreless overtime periods before Harvard finally found the back of the net in the third overtime frame—72 minutes after the tying goal. Corriero found Julie Chu in front of the Mercyhust goal, and the forward found net with a quick, backhanded shot to hand the Crimson a hard-fought victory.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
 
January 6, 1923: Picking the Lock
A recent correspondent of the Alumni Bulletin makes the rather startling suggestion that Harvard be represented next fall by two Varsity, football teams instead of one, and that while one plays Yale at New Haven the other play Yale (who is also to have two teams of course) in Cambridge, the winner being the college which amasses the largest combined score. In this way all ticket-difficulties would be abolished, and the proportion of players to spectators would be increased.
 
January 8, 1934: Hitler Refuses Favor to Harvard Students Group
Chancellor Adolph Hitler has refused to authorize the use of his name to a group of his disciples at Harvard, it was revealed yesterday. About three weeks ago a group of students who have grown to admire the Nazi leader decided to establish a club for the purpose of studying the dictator's policies. A letter was sent to the Chancellor asking for permission to use the name "Hitler Haven."
Charles E. Schwer '37, leader of the group, received a letter yesterday from Baron von Tippelskirch, German Consul General in Boston, saying that Chancellor Hitler had asked him to inform the students that it was against his policy to authorize the use of his name for organizations of any kind.
January 11, 1949: Buck Hails Lamont’s Open Shelves
Lamont Library marks a return to the belief that education is based on unrestricted access to all that humanity has thought and experienced, Provost Buck told the audience at the dedication of the new library yesterday afternoon. "Our worser selves have had little confidence in the capacity of man to solve his fate, have treated our students as though they were children, and so have sought to substitute for free inquiry, discipline and restraint," he said.
Buck joined President Conant, Keyes DeWitt Metcalf, University Librarian, Thomas S. Lamont, son of the late Thomas W. Lamont '92, and William D. Weeks '49, president of the Student Council in speaking at the dedication ceremonies in the Library's Forum Room today.
January 11, 1960: The State of the Union
The Socialist virtue of self-criticism has never been an American strong-point, and lately it seems to have deserted the Soviet Union as well. Izvestia recently reported the case of a collective farm which claimed that it had over-fulfilled its quota for egg production by 25 per cent; a check disclosed that the farm had no hens.
Meanwhile, on the American front, the President has delivered his final State of the Union message. After some pious words about the "definite necessity" of "self-examination," Mr. Eisenhower expresses himself satisfied with the results of seven years of Republican administration. The President, James Reston said last year, has touched upon all the great issues of the age and has come to grips with none of them; this record is unchanged. As one Southern Democrat remarked after last week's message, Mr. Eisenhower continues to feed the country on a diet of "homily grits."
 
January 9, 1968: Ice Age Returns in 20th Century
Cambridge pulled on its longjohns yesterday as the coldest temperatures in memory put the weekend's eight and a half-inch snowstorm on ice.
Mufflered pedestrians looked like Napoleon's army fleeing Russia as they scrambled past the frozen corpses of cars stranded in the snow.
Hundreds of commuters fumed as they waited hours for local garages to start their cars. Cambridge police showered traffic tickets on vehicles blocking the streets, and 1000 cars were towed in Boston yesterday, the Globe reported.

When it comes to endorsements, Ed Markey is on a roll.
Former Congressman Barnett "Barney" Frank '61-'62 announced this week that he's supporting fellow Democrat Rep. Edward J. Markey in the special election that will commence later this year if Senator John F. Kerry is confirmed as Secretary of State.
Frank's endorsement comes as yet another small triumph for Markey, who in recent weeks has seen many prominent Massachusetts Democrats, including Victoria Reggie Kennedy and Kerry himself, voice their support for his candidacy.
President Obama nominated Kerry to the post in December, and the longtime senior Senator from Massachusetts is expected to be easily confirmed in the coming weeks. Assuming confirmation, a law passed in 2006 by the Massachusetts legislature dictates that a special election must be held within 160 days to fill the seat.
Frank told a Boston radio station this week that he was backing Markey in the special election not only because of his work on climate change and gun control regulations, but because, in Frank's estimation, potential Democratic challenger Rep. Michael Capuano of Somerville is "probably not running."
In the special election, Markey would probably face former Senator Scott P. Brown, who was unseated in November by former Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren. Warren has said that she will not endorse a Democratic candidate in the special election.
Brown, who won his seat in a 2010 special election against Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, has not yet declared his candidacy, but he did take time in a radio interview last week to take some jabs at Markey, suggesting that the representative spends too much time at his DC area home and not enough time back in his district.
Frank has asked Governor Deval L. Patrick '78 to appoint him as a temporary Senator. He hopes to serve in the interim between Kerry's expected confirmation and the special election, which would probably occur in early summer.
