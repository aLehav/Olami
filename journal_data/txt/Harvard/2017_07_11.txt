Well behaved women seldom make history.
That was true for Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, a professor of the history of women and early America here at Harvard, who coined the term in an early 1976 paper on women in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was a short aside within the whole of the paper, not nearly the thesis or its prominent focus, yet this adage skyrocketed in pop culture and was referenced in multiplicative ways that validated feminine activism and incentivized women to fight against the mold of the timid, submissive stereotype projected onto them. It quickly became the rallying cry for women everywhere. It has most recently been used in this regard during the Women’s March this past January, where millions of women around the world paraded this quote on signs. They called out the Trump administration on its actions during the past election cycle, reminding the world that women’s rights are human rights and should be treated as such.
It was true for Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, for Rosa Parks, for Susan B. Anthony, for Sonia Sotomayor, for the millions of women who took a stand at the Women’s March, and many more.  Yet the actions of these women, despite their strength and valiant attempts to defend causes they believe in, continue to be dragged through the mud.
When Rosa Parks courageously challenged Jim Crow laws by refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, she was arrested. When Susan B. Anthony tried to deliver speeches on the need for suffrage and tried to vote, she was denied a lectern and arrested. When Sonia Sotomayor expressed pride in her origins and culture—a Latina woman from a low-income family—she was met with comments calling her a “reverse racist” and urging the withdrawal of her nomination for the Supreme Court.  All of these powerful women in history have had to endure different degrees of injustice to simply advocate for their beliefs and identities.
Where is the line drawn between characterizing a women as strong for standing up for herself versus characterizing her as something to arrest, ill-behaved—even nasty?
The most recent traces in the sand were birthed out of the recent presidential election. Nicholas Kristof, a lauded New York Times columnist, sat down with Hillary Clinton and discussed what lead to her ultimate demise on the campaign trail. In a totally ad hoc and out-of character response, Clinton underlined her downfalls bluntly: “Certainly misogyny played a role in it. That just had to be admitted.” While certain news sources may disagree, it is inarguably true that throughout her candidacy for the presidency, Clinton was subjected to a plethora of insults aimed at undermining her qualifications for the position due to her gender. Many of these came from President Trump, a man notorious for his insults on Twitter and his particularly licentious and salacious comments towards women. He also labeled Clinton “the devil” and, most infamously, a “nasty woman”.
Social media took this latter remark and ran with it. It was the ultimate modern rendition of Ulrich’s original rallying cry and spread rampantly through pop culture. It quickly became the center of a solidarity movement for women who felt affected by the then-president-elect’s misogynistic retorts. Women branded themselves with this, their hopes following in the footsteps of Ulrich’s adage—to stand up for themselves and their beliefs, to ignore those who underestimated their strength simply because of their gender, and to be as “ill-behaved” and as “nasty” as necessary.
This disgusting rhetoric and behavior towards women cannot simply be chalked up to historical blunders or a counterargument to political correctness. We as a society cannot blanket ourselves under the guise of change, pretending that we have evolved from such neanderthalian actions against women and that we have given women and men the equal platform they deserve. Although these aspirations are admirable, we must not be complacent with the system and mislabel any societal advance as “good enough,” easing our quest for equality; progress has occurred, yes, but haltingly so. The struggle to keep strong women from being undermined due to their sex is not over.
Well behaved women seldom make history—this much was true for a long time. But nasty women will and always have had a hand in shaping the world we live in, and we must never forget this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, I finally finished reading a book I started last September. Entitled “Why They Do It: Inside the Mind of the White-Collar Criminal” and written by my brilliant seminar professor, Eugene Soltes, it explores everything from the law-evasions of Enron to the downfall of Bernie Madoff. However, the segment I found most interesting detailed the psychology behind big-money fraudsters, particularly their outdated intuition. Soltes explains that the modern business world presents complexities foreign to the environments in which our ancestors lived, highlighting a time gap between the current world and evolutionary behaviors. In short, the future is moving quickly, and human instinctive reactions are having a hard time keeping up.
What strikes me most about this phenomenon is how it is overlooked when discussing economic policy. In liberal economic theory specifically, there is a tendency to favor what is fair and equal over what is most efficient, with hopes to foster equality in an inherently unequal socio-economic class system. Here, the morals leading one to distinguish what is right from wrong plays a monumental role, dangerously imposing a binary. What is right might not be what is best, and what worked back then might not be what works now.
For example, it might be economically favorable to dissolve the minimum wage—corporations profit more by reducing spending and increasing profits—but whether it would be moral or just for the working class is another question. The choices one believes to be good or bad are built upon instinct, which might just be getting in the way.
The issue is not that emotion is involved at all, but rather that it is approached in an inadequate manner. Despite the United States boasting the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous economy, our history of sudden recession and market collapse coupled with the myriad corrupt behaviors showcased in Eugene’s book suggest our nation has room to do better. Most business decisions are founded upon objective, hard data, but when humans are left to decide upon more subjective economic matters, opinion and morality hold the joystick.
Another example of morality’s  perhaps-too-powerful interference can be found in a recent Freakonomics podcast. The piece introduces a sort of death insurance, which allows terminally ill patients to decline further medical treatment and puts the money they would have spent on hospital bills right back in their pockets. This idea is optimal in the sense that the deceased’s family can now afford tuition, housing, travel, and previously unattainable luxuries. However, its cold-blooded, utilitarian morale renders it extremely unfavorable. The podcast concludes that though the majority of economists agreed it would create economic prosperity, its associated ethics and emotion pushed so strongly against it that it could not be put into action.
The very essence of democracy (save for the mismatch between who won the popular vote and who sits in the Oval Office) suggests that if the people don’t want something, it’s not going to happen. But what if our inherent logic, in these cases and others, is not advanced enough for what the business world is producing right now? In which scenarios do our intuitions remain accurate, and in which are they outdated and inadequate factors in decision making? The solution is not to disregard emotion entirely, but instead to reevaluate its role in the modern economy. Technological advancements are exponentially accelerating the speed of knowledge and innovation, and our thinking, foundation, and intuition need to be evolving just as quickly.
More focus must be placed on objectivity, and less on the ways in which instinct might drive us away from it. Of course, unanimous economic decisions are rare or simply absent in issues such as tax policy or bank regulation. However, once we begin to dissect the base upon which our intuition is built and attempt to consider alternate approaches, we might uncover that the best course of action cannot be classified as either right or wrong. Perhaps there exists a third option entirely. Let’s not allow human error to stop us from finding it.
It is clear that the world in which we live bears little resemblance to that of our predecessors centuries or even decades ago. The current era is abundant with movement, perpetually changing, and becoming more advanced and inventive than ever. We cannot hinder our prosperity by neglecting the lack of synchronicity between our evolutionary impulses and the present globalized world. When evaluating economic policy, we must recognize instinctive thought while simultaneously acknowledging it might be flawed. The future of economics is moving on without us and we cannot keep watching as it runs away.
