After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ricardo Alberto Maldonado’s “The Life Assignment” aims to put words to the hard-to-describe feeling of displacement, examining the dissonance between Maldonado’s home of Puerto Rico and his current residence in New York City. Not only does Maldonado do so through the substance and contextual effect of his words, but his use of dual language poetry also provides insight into the world of a displaced Puerto Rican living in the continental United States. The collection presents every poem in English, with some accompanied by Spanish translations.
Maldonado explains that some of these poems were first written in Spanish and purposefully mistranslated into English: “Translations and intentional mistranslations are mine. Poems presented in both languages were written in Spanish then rendered into English. Whereas the process of translating work dictated some changes in the original, at no time were concessions made to the language of (our current) Empire,” he writes in the notes. In trying to remain truthful and faithful to his original words in Spanish, Maldonado creates a distance between the original poem and its English result. In this way, Maldonado is able to portray the experience of displacement through the feeling of discomfort with a foreign language.
The English doesn’t entirely reveal Maldonado’s original intention in creating these poems, and despite the fact that these poems still portray the same content, a reader without an understanding of the Spanish originals might find the English mistranslations clunky or one-sided. They depict the life of a displaced individual trying to assimilate with a new language that doesn’t entirely flow the same way their native tongue does. In fact, the reverse experience of reading a purposefully poor translation of the author’s work allows the reader to achieve just a glimpse of this exact discomfort.
These poems, regardless of their bilingual nature, read like incantations, where the sensation of the language in your mouth offers just as much to the feel of the poem as the words on the page. The transcendent feeling of reading a poem out loud is often overlooked, but in the case of Maldonado’s bilingual poetry, every bit of pronunciation is important.
Maldonado’s poetry focuses on exploring displacement through form and content, but the rest of the collection dissects topics like queer identity, love, family, home (longing for and searching for), and the distresses of late-stage capitalism. To some extent, Maldonado’s collection is a love letter to finding peace in a capitalist world that disregards the value of human life. The depersonalization that occurs under capitalism is a struggle that infects nearly every part of our lives. Finding home, finding love, forming relationships — as Maldonado’s poems demonstrate, they all become difficult in the uncaring hands of our capitalist world.
Maldonado’s poetry is stripped bare through the translation process, then rebuilt again into a different form and body under its new language. Still, Maldonado is able to conjure up beauty in lyric, symbol, and metaphor, regardless of the language barriers and mistranslation process. At times confusing and hard to understand, this collection embraces the disorientation of its contents and molds that disorientation into an extension of the meanings of the poems themselves. All the while these poems remain entertaining through Maldonado’s craftful use of both English and Spanish words (sometimes distinctly separate in two versions of the same poem, and sometimes interjecting the English with phrases in Spanish) to depict images that evoke emotion, just as the speaking of his poetry does.
Maldonado’s collection is not only a beautiful manifestation of his experiences, but it also provides insight into the disorienting world a displaced individual lives in. The feeling of being displaced is oftentimes difficult to express through words alone, but Maldonado is able to instill that feeling by masterfully playing with the reader’s own ability to understand language. His English poems are beautiful in their own right, yet not only do they impose a feeling of misunderstanding and confusion, but also the revelation that the Spanish poem is even slightly different creates a longing for understanding: a longing felt by the displaced trying to find their bearings, a longing felt by a queer man trying to find love, and a longing for anyone just trying to find a place to call home amidst a capitalist society designed to perpetuate suffering and that endless feeling of alienation.

Opening with a wide shot of a half-finished bridge, each end anchored to a fog-veiled skyline, Mundruczó’s “Pieces of a Woman” is a film about the intangible bridges burnt and built in the wake of emotional trauma. Striking cinematography and a standout performance by Vanessa Kirby combine to create a wrenching depiction of a young woman’s interior self through a collage of carefully crafted exterior details. Its only shortcoming occurs at the end, which sacrifices some of the film’s resonance for the sake of closure.
Kirby stars as Martha Weiss alongside Shia LaBeouf as her partner Sean Carson, a construction worker on the bridge from the opening shot. The couple are expecting a baby very soon, and there is a sense of anticipation in the air as they pick up their new car, a practical gray minivan. “This is us now,” Martha remarks, referring to their family of three. But when their baby’s home birth goes terribly wrong and the wailing ambulance sirens fade to a suffocating black, that same “us” disintegrates.
In the next scene, Martha walks briskly along the street, her coat a jarring red against the pale, washed-out neutrals of her surroundings. Her face betrays little emotion as she suffers prying stares from coworkers and smothering condolences from an encounter with a family friend. The film begins to settle into a softer rhythm — gone are the abrupt, swinging cuts of the camera leading up to the baby’s birth and the maze-like claustrophobia it created. Now, slow tracking shots and close-ups of Kirby allow a study of grief in all its subtleties: Though Martha rarely cries, the set of her mouth and the detached look in her eyes convey her aching loss.
The progression of time is tracked by recurring shots of the bridge under construction as the weather gives way to New England winter. Desperately trying to find who is responsible for the tragedy, Martha’s family presses charges against the midwife present at the birth, introducing a layer of legal proceedings that does nothing to alleviate Martha’s pain. There is a sense of perpetual incompletion throughout the film; even as the two ends of the bridge draw closer to one another, the relationships in Martha’s life — with her mother, with Sean — splinter apart into simmering tensions and regrettable words. Mundruczó makes ample use of symbolism, and while certain moments veer towards cliche, others elicit a raw, intimate pain: a shot of two withered plants separated by a windowsill after a fight with Sean, the yoga ball used during her pregnancy deflating sadly when she stubs out her cigarette, Martha saving the seeds from her apple while watching the children next to her on the subway. It is difficult not to get attached to those tiny seeds, as Martha researches books on sprouting and places each one tenderly between cotton pads, offering a glimmer of hope for the first time.
The film is not easy to watch, both emotionally and visually. Clear shots are few and far between, and the audience’s view is often obstructed or distorted. The edges of windows, doorways, and car dashboards cut through frames, while characters are often seen through glass panes and in partial mirror reflections, lending them a certain disembodied isolation. In particular, the baby’s nursery room is shot in a way that never allows the viewer entry beyond a static rectangle enclosed by the door frame as Martha packs away toys and books. “Why’re you trying to disappear my kid?” Sean pleads, to which she responds brusquely, “Because we don’t have a kid.” In a film that is less plot-driven, these visual manipulations give the emotional states of the characters a sharp, dimensional reality.
LaBeouf delivers a convincing performance as Sean, though his character conforms to stereotypical standards of masculinity in a way that can make him feel more like a stereotype than a person. It seems like the film recognizes this, but is unable to come up with a solution, opting instead to cut him out of the picture entirely with a hasty explanation. In a way, it works, forcing Martha to confront her pain independently and directly — a shift signified by the stable, unobstructed shots of her face as she speaks to her mother, and later on, to the courtroom.
The film is able to hold on to its quiet momentum throughout a two-hour runtime, building up to a finale that is beautifully constructed. Yet its careful detail feels almost too heavy-handed, falling short of the authenticity in Kirby’s portrayal. For the sake of closing his metaphors neatly, Mundruczó pulls together all of his symbols at once, offering a sense of closure that hasn’t quite been earned. Nevertheless, “Pieces of a Woman” remains a powerful, graceful meditation on grief, leaving its audience with that same lingering, bittersweet ache of biting into an apple core.

Remi Weekes’ 2020 horror film “His House” features its fair share of ghastly creatures — but it just may be that the actual spectres aren’t nearly as scary as the social and psychological ones. Weekes’ first feature-length film is a notable entry into the canon of socially relevant horror films, applying elements of the genre to a fresh context: political refugees attempting to make a home in a new country. Both visually and narratively compelling, “His House” is an affecting portrait of trauma, guilt, and the refugee experience.
The film’s opening sees Bol (Ṣọpẹ Dìrísù), Rial (Wunmi Mosaku), and their daughter Nyagak (Malaika Wakoli-Abigaba) fleeing from violence in their South Sudanese hometown. The couple learns that they have been granted asylum in England and will be assigned to a home where they must abide by a strict set of rules to remain in the country. After moving into their new home, however, the couple soon realize that they’re far from alone: Strange noises in the walls, shadowy figures, and other strange phenomena haunt Bol and Rial with increasing frequency as they attempt to adapt to their new life and — as their case worker Mark (Matt Smith) tells them, — to “get along, fit in… be one of the good ones.”
Ultimately, Weekes’ subversion of classic horror tropes allows for a poignant exploration of survivor’s guilt: The run-down house that Bol and Rial move into isn’t already haunted — the couple brings its many supernatural tormentors with them. Furthermore, Weekes puts a fresh spin on conventions of the horror genre by incorporating South Sudanese mythology and spiritual belief into the film’s lore. At one point, Rial explains that she believes the evil lurking in the house to be an apeth, or a night witch that demands a sacrifice. She tells her husband, “an apeth has arisen from the ocean… it has followed us here. It said we don’t belong here.”
The film is not overly reliant on jump scares or lengthy action sequences; it is the presence and persistence of the ghosts — which are brought to life with truly striking makeup and visual effects — that is most frightening. Weekes ultimately creates an effective metaphor for the loss and remorse that plague the refugee couple, wherein the grotesque becomes a physical manifestation of trauma, memory, and regret.
Weekes’ direction and Jo Willems’ cinematography also capture a plethora of striking visuals. Willems’ clever use of light and shadow motifs quite literally illuminates different facets of the refugee experience. Whereas shots inside the couple’s home eerily juxtapose flickering lights and darkness, scenes set in British establishments are graded in bleak, pallid tones; each lighting technique creates a distinct sense of unease. But Willems’ horror-related shots are especially terrifying — and beautifully evocative. In one particularly memorable sequence, Bol sits at the dinner table with his wife; however, the camera soon pulls back to reveal Bol, alone, his wife having disappeared from the frame. In this surrealist shot, the half-destroyed kitchen wall stands in front of a blood-orange sky, and Bol finds himself and his kitchen table half-submerged in zombie-infested waters.
Weekes artfully interpolates flashbacks with present-day action for a narrative that unfurls gradually to a satisfying end. As the film progresses, the story of Bol and Rial’s harrowing journey — and the true reason for their immense guilt — is slowly revealed. This narrative technique can get a bit confusing, but it exemplifies the interconnectedness of memory, feeling, and the past: It is only when this murky backstory is fully divulged to the audience — and confronted by its characters — that our protagonists can truly begin to contend with their demons. Dìrísù and Mosaku’s performances are stunning and sympathetic: The two are raw and believable in their portrayals of fear and desperation, ultimately embodying two divergent approaches to acclimatization. Though the film utilizes dialogue somewhat sparingly, its script is precise, revealing many plain truths about the psychological and physiological toll of relocation and attempted assimilation.
Despite being a thriller, “His House” takes its time, a choice that makes its message that much more impactful. Bol and Rial’s new home is threatened not only by an internal darkness, but also by less obvious institutional evils. Subtle moments throughout the film illuminate microaggressions that are all too familiar to many people of color — and are scary in a very real way.
However, it is the film’s notable conclusion that truly drives home its singular take on everyday social horrors. Weekes subverts genre conventions one last time in the film’s conclusion, redefining notions of victory and survival for his characters: Bol and Rial’s ultimate triumph over the apeth does not signify the end of their psychological torment. Indeed, just as the film's title suggests, Bol and Rial’s house might never truly feel like it belongs to them alone as their past will always be with them. But it is their acceptance of this fact — and their decision to keep moving forward regardless — that makes it their own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many of you, I am disgusted, horrified, ashamed, and enraged by the direct assault on the U.S. Constitution and our democratic institutions that occurred on Jan. 6. President Donald Trump instigated an insurrection to disrupt the electoral process. That the preceding sentence is not fiction infuriates me to my core.
But we cannot be too hasty to cast judgment on all his voters.
My grandparents, with my five-year-old father in tow, took a stand against a brutal, populist tyrant in their homeland. They were driven from their country, leaving everything behind. They arrived in the United States as political refugees on Jan. 6, 1961 — 60 years to the day before the storming of the Capitol. When my 92-year-old grandmother saw the images of the Capitol riots on TV in her nursing home, the long-buried trauma of 1961 came to the surface. In a confused panic, she began calling my dad to ask if our family was safe and whether it was time to begin packing in preparation for leaving the country. These calls went on all day. Because of Covid-19 precautions, my dad could not comfort her in person.
As angry as I am, I share the hopeful attitude expressed by many. I have met several individuals in public office, and I believe most are good people. As a visiting politician recently told one of my classes, to lose optimism is to give up. As he eloquently put it, the history of our country — so often warped into a series of simplistic ideological parables designed to reinforce one political stance or another — is one of progress. Often halting and fumbling, often flawed and incomplete, but progress nonetheless. While currently an unpopular view at Harvard Law School, I find much to admire and much that inspires about this country’s history — while still acknowledging its many faults. I believe deeply in the ideals of our Constitution. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have joined the Navy 12 years ago ready to defend it and willing to die for it.
As revolted as we are, we can’t let our anger get the better of us. I am deeply worried by comments from those who hastily wrote off all elected officials as hopelessly corrupted or worse, or those who wrote off all Trump supporters as misogynists and racists. How quickly, in our well-justified rage, do we ascribe motives and labels to 74 million fellow citizens!
Trump has stoked racism, given a platform to extremists, provided a living example of misogyny and corruption, and attempted to warp and destroy our institutions for his personal gain. It is true that some of his supporters hold some of the very worst beliefs and prejudices that a person can have. But I hesitate to suggest that all or even most of the 74 million Americans who voted for Trump fall into these categories. Why? Because I know many of them. I’ve talked with them and debated with them. I’ve tried to learn what their world view is rather than ascribing one to them. I’ve tried to understand their fears, motivations, hopes, and dreams rather than applying a conveniently derisive label to the entire group and writing them all off.
I am not an apologist for those who are racist, anti-democratic, violent, or worse. These individuals and their views have no place in any democratic society. But I know that not all Trump voters fit that description. I know many who were appalled by what they saw on Jan. 6. I know many who have as great a lack of understanding and total disdain for all of us Ivy League-educated Biden supporters as many of us do for them.
Distrust and contempt are always easier from afar.
I’m grateful to be at HLS among you all, my fellow students. You all have my respect and admiration. But one source of frustration for me this first year has been the aversion to intellectual debate. Perhaps in this virtual environment I simply don’t know where to find it. But I often reflect on how in the Navy, we worked harder to understand the mindset, perspectives, and hopes of our potential adversaries — the people we might be called upon to kill — than some students try to understand their fellow citizens with different political opinions. How often, during virtual classes, do we retreat into chat channels of like-minded students to have our own views validated as we ridicule the opposing views offered by our classmates?
My message is simple. If you, like me, find yourself wondering how anyone could have voted for Trump, perhaps you should ask someone who did. Do not be so quick to label and dismiss, to ascribe motives that reflect more about your views than the views you are labeling. In these difficult and often disheartening times, we must not become intolerant, hateful, and arrogant in our quest against those same evils. Seek debate. Seek to have your ideas challenged, as iron sharpens iron. To quote the writer, Dr. Stephen R. Covey, “seek first to understand, then to be understood.” There’s no other way to fix this mess.

Contracted dining workers at two Harvard schools received welcome news this week as Harvard Medical School announced it would not pursue 16 layoffs as planned, and Harvard Law School announced it would continue paying contracted dining employees and eventually bring them in-house.
The University reduced support for employees covered by its emergency excused absence policy, which had sustained pay and benefits for all employees whose work had been suspended due to the pandemic, on Jan. 15. Idled contracted employees could no longer receive pay and direct employees could receive up to 70 percent of their pay, though continued application of the original policy was up to each Harvard school.
The Law School announced last Friday that it will terminate its contract with Restaurant Associates, a national dining services firm, and transition its food services to Harvard University Dining Services when dining facilities reopen. In the meantime, approximately 50 idled Restaurant Associates employees will receive 70 percent of their salary until at least June 30.
Separately, the Medical School announced Thursday that it will not lay off workers from Restaurant Associates as it had planned. Last Friday, the school informed roughly half of its dining workers — 16 employees — that they would be laid off on Jan. 29, according to one of the affected employees, Ed W. Holbrook. Following the Medical School's reversal of its decision, those employees will continue to work for full pay, according to HMS spokesperson Laura DeCoste.
Both announcements come after months of advocacy by unions and supporters on behalf of contracted employees subject to the policy change, including a petition signed by more than 1,100 Harvard affiliates and a Jan. 14 rally to demand pay for idled contracted workers in the spring. Harvard Business School and the Graduate School of Education previously announced that they would continue to pay contracted custodians.
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal thanked Restaurant Associates in an emailed statement and wrote that the firm’s employees will be integrated into HUDS by order of seniority.
“When campus dining facilities eventually reopen, HUDS has agreed to offer positions for Harvard Law School facilities, in order of seniority, to as many affected RA employees as possible,” Neal wrote. “HUDS will also consider RA employees for open positions at other HUDS-operated dining facilities across the University.”
The Law School will have provided more than $5.7 million to its idled dining workers for 15 months of continuity pay by June 30, Neal added.
Restaurant Associates did not respond to a request for comment Friday morning.
DeCoste also wrote in an emailed statement that the Medical School is grateful to the Restaurant Associates employees for their “hard work and dedication over the past 10 months amid the challenges of the COVID pandemic.”
“Harvard Medical School does not intend to reduce staffing levels, hours, or pay for Restaurant Associates employees at this time,” she wrote.
While HMS will not lay off the employees as planned, it has not committed to extending Harvard’s emergency excused absence policy to its contracted workers, were they to be idled.
Workers and student activists said they are glad that the schools have decided to increase protections for contracted workers.
“I’m just glad Harvard decided to do the right thing, because if they didn’t, it would have left me in the most financial hardship that I’ve ever been through,” said Joey A. King, a Restaurant Associates employee at HMS and father of four.
Tascha Shahriari-Parsa, a member of the Law School student advocacy group Labor and Employment Action Project, said he is “ecstatic” the Law School decided to “do the right thing,” adding that the student group will continue to support Restaurant Associates employees during the transition.
“We’ll have to see how they actually negotiate their agreement with the workers going in HUDS and how that all plays out to make sure that there’s nothing lost in that process,” Shahriari-Parsa said. “But it would have been awful if the dining staff were laid off and didn’t have wages or the means to survive between now and June, so we’re happy that now they do.”
Eugene Van Buren, a Law School chef currently employed by Restaurant Associates, said the transition of employees into HUDS by seniority leaves a great deal of uncertainty for contracted dining hall workers at the Law School.
“Only thing that we know is that Restaurant Associates aren’t going to be responsible anymore, so that leaves us in limbo,” Van Buren said. “We don’t know what’s gonna happen. I honestly don’t know what being absorbed by HUDS means as far as our seniority, if we have to be moved away to another area. Right now we don’t know anything. It’s an uneasy feeling.”
Blanca A. Iturralde, a Restaurant Associates employee at the Medical School, said she and her co-workers felt “relieved” by the cancellation of the layoffs, since she and many of her colleagues rely on their positions at Harvard as their only sources of income.
“For tomorrow, I don’t have to worry about where I am going to find the means to provide for my family,” she said.
Still, Iturralde said she worries how long Harvard will continue to offer her a job.
Holbrook also said he was relieved at the news, but remains concerned for the long term.
“There’s no guarantee how long we’re going to be back to work,” he said.
In the interim, Holbrook said that Restaurant Associates employees at HMS are continuing to push for 70 percent pay if they are idled by the pandemic.
“We’re still going to continue to fight to get the guarantee of the 70 percent pay like all the other HUDS and RA employees are getting,” he said.
Molecular and Cellular Biology Ph.D. student Hasreet K. Gill is organizing an event on Jan. 25 to contact Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 to secure 70 percent pay for workers should they be idled. Although HMS decided to rescind layoffs, the call-in event will still occur as planned, Gill wrote on Facebook.
“While this is a big victory, our call/write-in is STILL ON for Monday because the administration has not committed to paying people if there are future layoffs, as HLS and HBS has,” Gill wrote. “This still puts dining hall and custodial staff members at risk of job and health insurance loss.”

Harvard will provide Covid-19 testing to enrolled undergraduates living off-campus in the greater Cambridge area during the spring semester, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen announced in a Wednesday email.
The initiative marks the renewal of a fall pilot program that expanded Harvard’s coronavirus testing resources to 484 off-campus students in areas near campus. The pilot was met with praise by some of its participants.
“This screening program is part of our continuing efforts to monitor and manage the COVID-19 virus within the Harvard community,” Nguyen wrote in his email sent to College students living off campus in the greater Cambridge area this spring. “The program builds on the successful undergraduate off campus fall pilot and the robust screening protocols we put in place for our on campus community.”
Nazeli I. Hagen ’21, who shares an apartment near Harvard Yard with three other students and participated in the fall pilot, said she was “excited and relieved” that off-campus testing would continue in the spring.
“I think it also is just peace of mind for people,” she said. “The more things I can do to take precautions, the better.”
While College students living in Harvard’s dorms this spring are required to self-administer Covid-19 tests three times a week, participation in the off-campus screening program is voluntary.
“While testing is voluntary, the University is strongly encouraging you to participate,” Nguyen wrote in his email to students living near campus. “Doing so provides a greater opportunity for you to assist in efforts to keep Harvard healthy and better ensure the health and wellbeing of every member of our community.”
Students who opt into the spring program will initially receive three testing kits by mail, according to Nguyen’s email. Participants will be sent subsequent kits throughout the term as they submit one test sample per week at the HUHS clinic. All tests will be free to participants.
Students will receive their test results “usually within 24 hours” from health testing company Color, per the email.
Racheal L. Lama ’23, who is living near Harvard with three other students, said she is thankful she can protect her roommates by getting tested weekly.
“I was just really glad to have this opportunity for and privilege of regular testing,” she said. “Even though I’m not leaving the house often, I’m just glad to be able to do my part in ensuring the safety of my roommates.”
Alexandra J. Fogel ’23, who is staying in a North Cambridge apartment with two blockmates, said she is participating in the program because she wants to be “as safe as possible” in ensuring she does not unwittingly spread the virus to others.
“I do have to go grocery shopping, et cetera,” she said. “Just the knowledge that I could unknowingly pass someone the virus upsets me, so testing reduces that risk.”
Students participating in the testing program must also complete a state-mandated Covid-19 safety awareness training. Lama said the online module was “super informative” and only took about 30 minutes to complete.
“It included a lot of information — transmission rates, different individuals’ susceptibility to the virus,” she said. “It was just important things I feel everyone should know in order to keep our community safe.”
Students have until Jan. 29 to confirm their participation in the testing program.

Harvard is compiling lists of affiliates at increased risk of Covid-19 complications to prioritize for vaccination as it prepares to expand its in-house vaccination program.
The University received its first shipment of Covid-19 vaccines on Dec. 23 after being approved by Massachusetts to be a provider for the statewide vaccination program, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said in a Tuesday interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
The first shipment included 200 doses of the Moderna vaccine and another recent shipment included 300 more doses, per Nguyen.
In accordance with state public health guidelines, Harvard allocated the initial vaccine shipments to healthcare workers at its affiliated hospitals most likely exposed to Covid-19. That category includes physicians, nurses, support staff, housekeeping staff at HUHS Urgent Care. Patient-facing Harvard Medical School students and Harvard Dental School affiliates who provide emergency dental services were also vaccinated in Phase One, Nguyen told the Gazette.
Harvard has begun to vaccinate non-Covid-facing healthcare workers, who are also included in Phase One of Massachusetts’ vaccination distribution timeline. Harvard’s police officers, who qualify under Phase One as first responders, will be vaccinated by the City of Cambridge, Nguyen said.
Under the state guidelines, individuals with high risk factors as well as those aged 75 and older will receive vaccination priority in Phase Two, predicted to begin in February.
In an email sent to HUHS patients Wednesday, HUHS Chief Medical Officer Soheyla D. Gharib wrote that HUHS is creating lists of higher-risk patients to prioritize for vaccination.
“Our team will contact you when it is your turn to get the vaccine, depending on your risk factors,” Gharib wrote. “The vaccine is safe and we are encouraging our patients to receive it.”
The vaccine will be available for the general public in Phase 3, which Massachusetts estimates will begin in April. Harvard plans to make the vaccine available to the “entire campus community” and will notify employees and students of availability through their department or school, Nguyen said in the interview.
“My hope is that we can get to Phase 3 as early as possible, but we want to make sure that the people who are at greatest risk for complications from COVID-19 are getting our attention first,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen also addressed the new leadership in Washington D.C. and said that vaccine distribution may “change dramatically” under the administration of President Joe Biden.
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines come in two doses and are about 95 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infection. Still, Nguyen said people who receive the vaccine should continue to follow mask-wearing and social-distancing guidelines to account for the remaining five percent chance and because it is unclear whether vaccinated individuals can still spread the virus.
Nguyen, who described the Covid-19 vaccines as “safe and effective,” urged everyone to get the vaccine when they are available.
“I would absolutely encourage everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated to take advantage of that opportunity. This is the first major large-scale approach that is available to us to stem the tide of this pandemic,” Nguyen told the Gazette. “The success of this approach, however, depends on how many people get vaccinated.”
“The sooner we have enough people vaccinated in our communities, the sooner we can also start to see life return closer to normal,” he added.

A Japanese government advisor threatened Harvard Management Company with a regulatory probe if Harvard did not cast a critical vote in support of Toshiba’s management at the company’s annual shareholders meeting last July, Reuters reported last month.
Hiromichi “Hiro” Mizuno, then a special advisor to Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, allegedly made the comments on a call with HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, according to the Reuters report.
Toshiba’s leadership has been the subject of intense scrutiny since 2017 when it sold $5.6 billion worth of stock to dozens of hedge fund shareholders in response to financial problems with its nuclear energy projects in the U.S.
HMC, which owns approximately four percent of Toshiba’s shares, abstained from the vote as a result of Mizuno’s remarks, but later learned there was no basis for a probe. Toshiba Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani retained his position following the vote with 57 percent of shareholders’ support.
Mizuno is the former investment chief of Japan’s state pension fund and a current board member at Tesla. He resigned from METI in December 2020, following his appointment as United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments.
After the Reuters report was published, Mizuno denied the allegations on Twitter.
“I am a METI adviser and a Harvard senior fellow and have a long relationship of trust with the endowment fund and as such, I am sometimes called on for consulting,” Mizuno wrote, according to a translation by Reuters. “However, it is extremely regrettable that this article, which is based on testimony from anonymous sources, is written as if the CEO/CIO was threatened by me on behalf of METI over the exercise of voting rights.”
Mizuno — who is an Executive Fellow at Harvard Business School for the 2020-21 academic year — did not respond to a request for comment.
Nevertheless, experts said that Mizuno’s resume makes him an influential figure in Japan’s business community.
Ryoma Nikaido, a reporter with the business magazine Weekly Toyo Keizai, wrote in an email that Mizuno has a close relationship to the Japanese government.
“It is certain that he is trusted by the Japanese government,” Nikaido wrote. “Government officials say there are few people in Japan more than Mr. Mizuno who can speak English fluently and have an influence.”
Christina L. Davis, a Harvard government professor who directs the University’s Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, said that Mizuno’s term as chief of the country’s pension fund is a strong indicator of his business policy influence.
“He would have close connections to people in the Ministry of Finance, people in the Abe administration,” Davis said. “He is definitely a very influential individual, and I’m sure that his efforts to share information would be taken as a credible signal.”
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan, declined to comment, citing HMC’s policy not to comment on individual investments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Square Business Association collaborated with the mutual aid initiative Cambridge Community Fridge to bring a community fridge to Harvard Square in early January.
The “Fridge in the Square” project aims to mitigate food insecurity in Cambridge by allowing locals to donate and grab food items from the community fridge as needed.
“Please take what you need and leave what you can, thank you,” a sign on the community fridge reads.
HSBA members, Y2Y Harvard Square — a youth homeless shelter usually staffed by Harvard students — Trinity Property Management, and The Sinclair — a gastropub in Harvard Square — contributed to the installation of the fridge, which is located in front of The Sinclair.
Executive Director of HSBA Denise A. Jillson said in an interview with The Crimson the association helped coordinate bringing the fridge to Harvard Square after being approached with the idea.
“The executive director of Y2Y and one of the managers at The Sinclair contacted me and said that they had heard about this fridge project and they wanted it to come to Harvard Square,” she said. “We were thrilled to be working with them.”
Jillson added that the project was feasible due to the assistance of numerous HSBA members and volunteers.
“All of the elements came together very quickly,” she said. “I think from start to finish, from the time that I received the initial email to the time that the fridge was actually installed in Harvard Square, was just about three weeks.”
Several Fridge in the Square volunteers wrote in an emailed statement that the grassroots mutual aid networks behind the fridge are working together “to create new systems for how we practice collective care for our communities.”
“We want to reimagine and transform the way we practice justice and safety in our communities,” the volunteers wrote. “This work is rooted in Black abolitionist theory and practice and the transformative justice movement.”
They added that Fridge in the Square volunteers want to reinforce a “no questions asked” atmosphere around the fridge.
“We want the fridge to be a resource for folks in the community, so [it’s] important that we respect the privacy and anonymity of anyone who wants to partake in the fridge,” they wrote.
For Covid-19 precautions, the fridge is sanitized three times a day and premade food items are only accepted from licensed kitchens, according to the organizers. In addition, fridge volunteers must confirm that they are not experiencing Covid-19 symptoms and have not been in contact with an individual who has tested positive in the past 14 days.
According to Jillson, the fridge has been used “robustly” and organizers are working to ensure the fridge remains full.
“The biggest challenge will be to – and I think we’re up to the challenge – keeping it full and make sure that we’re taking care of the people in our community that need it,” she said.
Cambridge resident Benjamin N. Levy ’69 called the community fridge a “lovely idea." At the same time, he acknowledged what he believes are the fridge's limitations.
“It seemed to me that it would serve some population of people who have food deficiencies, but then there’s another population of homeless people,” Levy said. “I saw that the food that was available, most of it needed to be cooked somehow or heated. The homeless people, I didn’t know whether they'd have access to a microwave or any way to heat things,” he said.
The Fridge in the Square volunteers wrote that they are looking for donations of both non-food products — laundry detergent, face masks, and hand warmers — and food products, such as flour, cooking oil, fresh fruits, vegetables, and deli meat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 57,000 students applied for a spot in Harvard College’s Class of 2025, marking a record high and forcing the Admissions Office to push back its decision release date by roughly a week, the office announced Thursday.
The College received roughly 42 percent more applications than last year, when 40,248 students applied for admission to the Class of 2024. This year’s record-high number of applicants comes two years after the Class of 2023 set the previous record with 43,330 applicants.
The Admissions Office notified applicants on Thursday that it would delay its admissions decision release date to April 6 due to the influx in applicants. Harvard released regular admissions decisions for the Class of 2024 on March 26, 2020.
Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that admissions officers require more time to thoroughly review all of this year’s applicants.
“Harvard conducts a wide-ranging review of every application in its whole person admissions process,” Dane wrote. “More time is needed to ensure that all admissions decisions can be conducted in the same careful and comprehensive manner as in the past.”
Of the more than 57,000 applicants to the Class of 2025, 10,086 students applied early action and 747 were accepted. Those numbers mark a record-high number of early applicants and a record-low acceptance rate — 7.4 percent — for the early admissions cycle. Harvard deferred roughly 80 percent of early applicants to the regular admissions round.
Following the release of early admissions decisions this past December, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67 said in an interview he believed the significant increase in the number of applicants was due to Harvard's robust financial aid program, its online recruiting efforts, and its decision to make standardized tests optional.
Though it was inundated with early action applications to the Class of 2025, the Admissions Office did not delay the release of early admission decisions.
Given the push back of regular admissions decisions, the College will give admitted students two additional days to decide if they will accept their spot in Harvard’s Class of 2025. Students have until May 3 at 11:59 p.m. to accept or decline their spot in the incoming freshman class.

It’s undeniable that last semester was a roller coaster ride for most of us, but what semester of college isn’t? Except this time, we’re all wearing masks, sitting a few seats away from each other, and generally having the weirdest year possible. There are endless things that would’ve been helpful to know before coming to campus last semester, so hopefully my knowledge may make your next ride on the ~Crimson Roller Coaster~ a bit more smooth sailing. Obligatory disclaimer that I am but a measly freshman who has no experience with pre-pandemic campus life, so maybe take everything I say with a few grains of salt ;)
The Packing Dilemma: What if I need it though?
I didn’t pack just for a pandemic… I packed for World War 3, a hurricane, and the very likely chance that I would go broke as soon as I stepped foot on campus. Although my wallet was in serious pain by the end of the semester, I didn’t actually end up using many things that I had brought along with me... like all three of the bookbags I had packed. Maybe I knew that the Yard squirrels were fearless, to the point where they would gang up on me to steal my precious bag when I stepped outside. This epic battle didn’t happen though, so I never needed my other bags. Now that I’m more aware that college students like staying comfy (it’s PJ day everyday!), and that an iPad with Goodnotes (for sure superior to Notability) is essentially every school supply packed in one, I definitely would have brought less to my dorm.
Living in Dorms While Being Dead Inside
Did my roommate and I have enough fans to start our own fan club? Yes. Did we have a bunch of spare furniture that just sat there with a bag of M&Ms in a random drawer? Yes. The living spaces were plenty spacious, but the massive amounts of furniture made the space look dreary. Me, with my big brain, had not bought many decorations, as we were told to pack lightly and only bring the necessities (I followed this to a T only when it came to decorations 0.0) — Zoom fatigue was only made worse by staring at the plain walls of the common room. I wish I would have known this so I could have decorated the space to make it look more livable! LED lights, plenty of pictures, tapestries, and a more colorful rug than the plain brown one I had would have been perfect for the impossible task of making my Zoom fatigue disappear. tl;dr: Please bring some sort of decor, you're really going to need it.
Hanging Out, And Hanging In 
I have no idea whether it was the pandemic’s doing (though let’s be real, it definitely was), but most of my socializing took place while eating six feet apart from all my closest pals. Although there were many “we should eat together sometime” instances that ended up going nowhere (as expected), there were also some that were very fulfilling (literally and figuratively, considering how full I was afterwards). It was also healthy to step out of my dreary dorm to go work on the Widener Library steps, in the Yard, or at the Smith Campus Center — the new on-campus hotspots for seeing friends. I wish I would have gone to the Smith Center and Cabot Library sooner though, especially as the weather got colder and it became impossible to study outside. Hopefully you find such warm study spots earlier in the semester than I did!
Though we may finally know who’s going to be on campus this semester, it still feels totally up in the air what our time in Cambridge will actually end up looking like. Either way, hopefully my ~experiences~ are helpful on your next Crimson Roller Coaster ride!
