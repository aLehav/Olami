After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For teenagers or young “twenty-somethings,” Harvard students tend to act a lot like forty-year old corporate executives. I’m not talking about a general obsession with business casual or the fact that the only sport we really seem to excel at is squash. Instead, I am referring to how Harvard students, like workaholic professionals, seem to have time only for work, be it academic or extracurricular. “Social time”—hanging out with friends—has to be “scheduled in,” often weeks in advance. People too often ask  friends to grab lunch only to be told without irony, “Let me check my G-cal and get back to you.” Marissa A. Mayer, new CEO of Yahoo, would be horrified at the measly amount of interaction occurring between Harvard students. If she thinks the lack of “communication and collaboration” among Yahoo employees is a problem, I tremble to think of her reaction to the anti-social atmosphere of this campus.
This may seem like an obvious statement—just an everyday fact of life here at Harvard. Everyone is busy, and everyone is excited and dedicated to various schoolwork and activities. It is a wonderful characteristic of our university that so many people are passionate about all the different things that they're doing. Getting A’s in classes, dancing some fabulously strange dances at Ghungroo, and attending every Phillips Brooks House Association open house all rightly receive our full attention and intensity. However, when it comes to making time for friends, we fall short. This is a mistake.
College life—the opportunity to live with all your friends and see them each and every day—never happens again. The older we get, the harder it will be to find time to just chat and coexist. Families, work, and in my probable case, caring for my obese cats, will start to take precedence in later years as friendships start to exist for weekends and special occasions. Here and now at Harvard, we have the opportunity to engage with our friends in unstructured ways; yet this is usually the last thing we're thinking about. I mean, these are supposed to be the best years of our life, man.
I’m not arguing that Harvard students should stop working hard or forsake all activities on campus. But I do think it would be valuable to stop behaving as if we’re all on the fast track at Goldman Sachs. That p-set is still going to get done even if you go to brain break for fifteen minutes. Who says that if you don't comp every single publication on this campus and fail to attend every IOP study group, you will be earmarked as a loser for the rest of your life? One trip to Pinkberry is not going to throw your political career under the bus. Although it seems like there is absolutely no time, such a characterization is untrue. We do have time. And we could all put in the effort to make a little more.
You may ask yourself why this even matters. We go to Harvard to learn and to succeed, not to shoot the breeze and banter. It matters for two reasons.
Firstly, we need haphazard human as well as sterile electronic connections to enrich our lives and keep a sense of perspective in such a high-stress environment. There is so much neurosis at Harvard that more downtime with friends can only help dial back our anxiety. With all the recent talks about mental health, I cannot help but wonder if we might be a little less stressed if only we spent more time talking to each other rather than typing in earnest.
Secondly, some of the best ideas come from schmoozing. Just bantering about something random may trigger one of those eureka moments of uncalculated innovation. It was a casual remark by a Microsoft guy that got Steve Jobs moving quickly on the Pad. Friends can inspire you in ways big and small, sometimes even with an irreverent comment or offhand joke. As Marissa Mayer noted in her memo to Yahoo employees, “Some of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and impromptu team meetings.” Although many of her employees may have been furious, I think in time they will agree with her wisdom.
If we all make a little more effort with each other, I think our lives on campus will improve significantly. And this means real effort, not a text with a grinning monkey emoji. (Is that supposed to be a signal that you want to get dinner?) The constant refrain of “too busy” should be abolished from our vocabulary. Many years from now, looking back, we will regret it if we spent these years glued to our laptops instead of each other. As John Lennon once sang, "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My little sister was three days old when the first bombs fell on Baghdad. Today, she’s two weeks from her tenth birthday, but the American military only withdrew from Iraq three months ago and continues the war in Afghanistan.
By the time U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan, children old enough to be in high school will have never known a day when their country was not at war. On the other side of the world, a whole generation of Afghani and Iraqi children, by sheer accident of birth, cannot forget a scarred legacy—of the relentless explosions around them, the menacing whine of deadly jets above them, and the graves of their loved ones below them.
These long-lasting miseries are the casualties unaccounted for in official body counts. Living through 9/11 and its aftermath as a seven-year-old Muslim boy in New York City gave me a glimpse into the sorrows so sadly routine in less fortunate parts of the world. Like the billowing smoke I could see rising from Manhattan, an epidemic of grief quickly perforated the thoughts of my city and my country. In rash decisions to commit violence or to wage war, too little gravity is given to incalculably severe human costs.
But this is not an apology for pacifism. I am not opposed to all war—I am only opposed to pointless wars.
Yet the near decade-long occupation of Iraq—after a rushed decision made on the basis of cherry picked intelligence later proven to be spurious, before United Nations inspectors could thoroughly investigate alleged stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction—is not the only pointless war waged by our feckless leaders.
Consider Congress, that dysfunctional, dyspeptic body only capable of trundling from one manufactured crisis to another. In the needless, melodramatic wars waged by grandstanding, self-indulgent officials, the inevitable casualty is the well being of the young, the minorities, and the poor—in short, the unconnected.
Our predilection for pointless wars disenchants both our citizens and the citizens of the world. Americans see our soldiers, some grievously wounded, others killed, and many disturbingly abandoned, fighting a war in Iraq founded on false premises. Americans also see our politicians, captured by lobbyists and special interests, whose deification of ideological purity and delusional conflation of obstinacy with martyrdom constitute a dereliction of duty to the American people.
More pernicious than this inflated belligerence—and perhaps the only issue with unwavering bipartisan support—is the collective refusal to learn from or even acknowledge the dire consequences of our unnecessary wars.
Many of the most vocal supporters of the invasion of Iraq still loudly preach that their decision was not only vital but also beneficial. John R. Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. during the Bush administration, continues to fear monger by disingenuously declaring that American withdrawal from Iraq “is a tragic mistake” and “heralds a world of instability.”
James Fallows, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, rightly points out the noxious persistence of prominent demagogues like Donald H. Rumsfeld, noting that “after Iraq, there has been a weird amnesty and amnesia about people's misjudgment on the most consequential decision of our times.”
Claiming that the world is a better place since the removal of Saddam Hussein, perhaps the only original justification for the war that has not been thoroughly debunked, ignores the realities of more than 110,000 civilian deaths, a resulting power vacuum that enabled an increase in Iranian influence, and the grim precedent set by defying the international community to fight an unnecessary offensive war.
Moreover, the American stance toward totalitarianism, dictatorship, and human rights abuses is capricious and hypocritical at best. It would explain the lukewarm reception to certain populist democratic movements like the Arab Spring and the close trade relations with known human rights violators like China and Saudi Arabia. America props up unscrupulous and ruthless dictators when expedient, like the Shah of Iran, General Pinochet of Chile, and countless others, but somehow proclaims itself as a beacon of liberty and democracy to the rest of the world.
More than 4,000 American soldiers lost their lives fighting a war for little reason: alleged Iraqi ties with Al-Qaeda were fictive and weapons of mass destruction are nowhere to be found. To some, such a statement may seem unpatriotic for somehow dismissing the sacrifice of soldiers. But the truest patriotism and highest regard for our soldiers is not found in lip service, but instead in the prevention of the needless sacrifice and sorrow in the first place.
In Iraq, hundreds of children must live as orphans because of an impetuous judgment made a decade ago—in America, hundreds of children will now have to go without baby formula because of the self-inflicted sequestration enacted only a week ago.
Unless curtailed, our insatiable penchant for unnecessary wars will only continue to dole out damage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In October 1988, a ten-year-old girl named Sarah York traveled to Panama to meet with her Panamanian pen pal, the infamous military leader Manuel Noriega. Noriega was widely known in the United States as a corrupt leader who was later tried by the United States for drug trafficking, racketeering, and money laundering. There were also widespread claims that the Panamanian military, under Noriega’s command, engaged in widespread human rights abuses and harassment of US troops and civilians.
Sarah York’s continued visits and correspondence with Noriega were met with widespread disapproval at the time, by a public and political atmosphere that considered Noriega “Public Enemy Number One” at the time of the U.S. invasion of Panama. However, Ms. York and her family emerged with a very different account of this supposedly ruthless dictator, a unique point of view in the midst of highly biased coverage. While it can be argued that Ms. York was at a highly impressionable stage of her life and that Noriega was simply using her for political gain, the perspective was important in creating discourse.
On March 3, 2013, retired American Hall of Fame professional basketball player Dennis Rodman returned to the U.S. after a highly controversial trip to North Korea where he met and engaged directly with dictator Kim Jong Un. Rodman, nicknamed “The Worm,” returned with praise for Kim, saying “I love him. The guy’s awesome. He was so honest.” Many outlets are considerably and understandably critical of Rodman’s visit, which has been described as a lavish celebration of basketball greats filled with copious amounts of food and drink. These festivities stand in stark contrast to the millions of North Koreans in conditions of famine, under-nutrition, and general food insecurity.
Rodman’s visit sheds some light onto a country we typically discuss in tones of either indignant condemnation or hushed mystery. We often underestimate the power of appealing to the human side of these mysterious figures. Rodman’s role was not and should not be as a diplomat or another U.S. sanctioned political figure. He attended not as a representative or ambassador of our country, but as a well-known basketball great playing along with a media ploy by the company “Vice” and the Harlem Globetrotters. He emerged with insights on the dictator and his personal life that not even our C.I.A. could profess to know, and that’s a tactic we forget to consider.  There is nobody at the C.I.A. who could tell you more personally about Kim Jong Un than Dennis Rodman, and that in itself is scary.
We’re all human, and so we have public and private lives. People are different from the sensationalist depictions our media tends to feed us, and it thus becomes more important than ever to garner as many perspectives as possible. This is in no way a defense of the North Korean regime—the atrocities of prison camps and seemingly lack of regard for its citizens are inexcusable. However, it is important to understand that we all come from different upbringings and value systems; what Kim is doing (or not doing) is definitely wrong, but we need to understand why his imperial regime has been doing this, what the motivations are and the cultural biases that make him believe what he is doing is acceptable in any way. From a nationalistic point of view, North Korea is terrified of the super powers of the West that stand against them. It builds up its nuclear program and weapons because we have a far greater stockpile of nuclear weapons on our side. It is hard for us to judge unless we are there.
Rodman should not be prohibited from future visits to North Korea. In fact, he should be encouraged to do so and to share his experience, biased or not. His first visit and the ensuing public outcry will give him exposure to the public side of Kim, the dictator that we have grown to revile, but Rodman will be able also to provoke a new type of conversation about North Korea.
So while the Rodman-Kim friendship may not be as deep as Rodman professes from his two day visit, it is a hopeful step towards gaining insight into a country and a man we know little about. Our media has built a perception of Kim as a power-hungry, emotionless dictator. And while the regimes and human rights abuses of Kim and his predecessors should be strongly condemned, it is also important to recognize Kim as only human. The man is not a myth or a legend, and we should not treat him as such.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, the White House and Congress failed to reach a deal to prevent drastic cuts in federal spending, indiscriminately slashing $85 billion of funding over the next seven months and $1.2 trillion over the next decade for domestic programs, research grants, and defense spending.
Washington’s incompetence will likely stymie the already lukewarm recovery, slowing growth by 0.6 percent and costing 750,000 jobs according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It squeezes already underfunded and over-stretched public programs and may prevent the delivery of baby formula to low-income mothers, turn out 125,000 residents from public housing, and deny food and formula to 775,000 at-risk women and children. Despite protests from senior Pentagon officials, funding to the Defense Department will be slashed by 7.8 percent. All this senseless cutting, purportedly designed to reduce long-term deficits, takes no action to address the two principal strains on the future budget: entitlement spending and the tax code.
Despite objections from university presidents, including Harvard’s Drew G. Faust, Congress severely cut funding to federal research agencies that provide much of the grant funding for basic research conducted at American colleges and universities that is vital for sustained, long-term economic growth. The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation will reduce both the number of grants awarded and sharply cut award amounts, forcing labs across the country to cut back on research projects and spend more time applying for already competitive grants.
Former NIH director Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni warns, “The most impacted are the young, new investigator scientists who…will now abandon the field of science. There will be a generational gap created.” Despite evidence that federal support of basic research has, according to the Congressional Budget Office, “a significantly positive return,” Congress unthinkingly sequestered research funding and clogged the pipeline of innovation critically needed for continuous economic growth.
Rather than focusing on a byzantine tax code that allows Apple to pay less than 10 percent to the federal government on its tremendous profits, or the astronomical  increase in entitlement spending, Congress is wrongly fixated on axing federal programs that undeniably benefit society at large, like basic research funding that drives growth or public programs that decrease poverty and inequality.
Most deplorably, the sequestration was never supposed to happen. The plan was originally designed during the equally irresponsible debt ceiling negotiations of August 2011 as a sword of Damocles so devastating that both parties could never let it continue.
But Congress let the sword swing down on America.

By my count, the clothes that I’m currently wearing have six pockets between them. Are any of them useful? Absolutely not.
In women’s clothes today, there is a distressing trend of aesthetic pockets rather than useful ones. Men’s clothes are positively riddled with pockets, with the exception of socks and underwear—because that would be weird. These pockets are wonderful, deep, capacious compartments which fit literally everything: phones, keys, wallets, small notepads, larger notepads, legal sized notepads, and an assortment of healthy snacks. My father is able to keep all of this in his pockets, plus a smaller jacket, which has even more pockets.
In contrast, I might be able to squeeze a slightly chewed piece of gum into the front pocket of my jeans. That is, if I didn’t mind the stickiness, which I do. Don’t even get me started on the back pockets. Theoretically, these are the pockets that are supposed to fit your phone and wallet. Dream big. Putting a phone in your back pocket is straight up asking for it to get flipped out into a toilet or a particularly sticky final club floor. The same risk is associated with women’s wallets—which incidentally are the size of baguettes (and go poorly with brie).
The impracticality of women’s pockets does not stop there. The chest pocket, the most frustrating pocket of them all, has absolutely no purpose other than to perch on top of our boobs and remind us that all of our pockets are useless. To be fair they do make nice finger warmers. But what do I have that fits in there besides my pinky? Nothing. What do I need to carry around? Everything.
It makes no sense that women, who, as romantic comedies have shown, carry around an inordinate amount of stuff, have pointless pockets, while men literally have small caves in their clothes for whatever phones, keys, and actual baguettes they happen to have.
The only solutions to this problem are buying bags, which are annoyingly expensive, or stashing items in your décolletage.And while this may be convenient, pulling your baguette out of your cleavage is not all that appetizing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New York Times columnist and former Crimson news editor Nicholas D. Kristof ’81 described what he sees as the three major challenges in the field of journalism Tuesday night after accepting the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism at the Harvard Kennedy School’s John F. Kennedy Jr. forum.
The first challenge Kristof addressed was what he called the “evaporating” business model of journalism. He said that news agencies must be more innovative if they want to “dominate the new landscape ahead.”
Kristof said that he believes established journalism institutions that feel as though they are doing important work tend to be overly careful.
“I think we probably do need to be more experimental,” he said.
To keep journalists who are doing important work in the field, Kristof said, “We have to figure out how to make money.”
The second challenge Kristof referenced was what he termed a U.S. retreat from “the rest of the world,” motivated in part by the economic downturn and by a general “weariness with Iraq [and] Afganistan.”
Kristof labeled the “rising distrust for the news media” as journalism’s third major challenge. In a time when news organizations are more polarized and publish inaccuracies twice as many times as in 1995, Kristoff said that a focus on ethics is more important than ever.
Alex S. Jones, Director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, and a New York Times reporter, called the Goldsmith Awards event a “highlight” for American journalism.
Alongside Kristof, the Shorenstein Center awarded Goldsmith book prizes to writers Jonathan M. Ladd and Rebecca MacKinnon.
Thomas E. Patterson, Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press at the Kennedy School, said that the Goldsmith Awards are set apart from other journalistic awards by the “expressed intent that the journalism be aimed at improving how the government works.”
Six finalists were recognized for their success in achieving this goal in investigative reporting. The Chicago Tribune’s Patricia Callahan, Sam Roe, and Michael Hawthorne were recognized for their series, “Playing with Fire,” and won the $25,000 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting.

School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray said that she anticipates a 30 percent growth in the size of the SEAS faculty over the next 10 to 15 years.
“We’re going to be doing a huge amount of hiring,” Murray said, adding that she expects SEAS to add 20 full-time equivalent positions to the tenured and tenure-track faculty.
SEAS currently has 67 tenured faculty members and 16 tenure-track faculty members, who collectively work for as much time as would an equivalent of 66.45 full-time faculty members.
Murray emphasized that when adding the 20 faculty positions, SEAS would also need to make up for retirements.
“To grow 20, I expect we’re going to hire 50,” Murray said. “This is just looking at the age of the faculty and the number who leave for one reason or another.”
SEAS has three confirmed hires—Shmuel Rubinstein, Jelani Nelson, and Yaron Singer—who will be joining the faculty in July. SEAS will also recognize the retirements of two faculty members—Michael O. Rabin and Peter P. Rogers—in May.
The number of full-time equivalents among SEAS faculty has grown by almost 50 percent since July 1998, when there were 44 full-time equivalents. Yet Murray said the faculty size needs to continue to grow to keep up with the number of undergraduate concentrators. Since 2009, the SEAS faculty has not grown, while the number of undergraduate concentrators has expanded by 70 percent.
Area Dean for Applied Physics Eric Mazur recognized the possibility of hiring additional faculty to help develop an applied physics concentration, but said that such plans are contingent on SEAS resolving its space needs.
“Right now, there’s very little extra space for hires, especially since most applied physicists are experimentalists and need a lab,” Mazur said. “So I think a lot of the hiring will depend on what happens to space, which is connected to the possibility of moving to Allston.”
Last month, University President Drew G. Faust told The Crimson that SEAS will relocate to Allston in as few as five years.
In an interview with The Crimson on Friday, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said that the move to Allston would provide room for SEAS to expand and hire new faculty members.
“The number of students taking SEAS courses has grown rapidly, [which] has placed huge demands on SEAS faculty,” Garber said. “Allston offers us the opportunity to give the SEAS faculty space to grow, to have state of the art facilities, and to some extent to bring SEAS faculty together.”
More immediately, SEAS will begin relocating some of its administrative staff to a new location in Harvard Square starting next month, according to an announcement from SEAS Executive Dean G. Timothy Bowman.
While growth remains a priority for the school, Area Dean for Electrical Engineering Evelyn Hu said she expects the hiring process to be carefully planned around cutting-edge research and undergraduate interest in different concentrations.
“Although SEAS hopes to and expects to grow in the next few years, I don’t think it’s anyone’s intention to grow carelessly and unconstrained,” Hu said. “The strength of an engineering program at Harvard is to focus on...what we do best and how we can grow in a way that is thoughtful and that adds value.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard-owned apartment buildings on Prescott Street are slated to become part of swing housing for students during the next wave of House Renewal, forcing current residents to relocate.
Residents of 20-20A and 22-24 Prescott Street must vacate their units by Feb. 1, 2014, according to a letter from Harvard University Housing. The buildings will be used for Dunster swing housing in 2014.
During its Monday night meeting, the City Council reviewed a complaint letter from a Ware Street resident, who protested the University’s decision to turn apartment buildings into swing space for the College and calling on the Council to intervene.
By unanimous consent, the Council referred the matter to the city’s University Relations Committee for further investigation.
According to the complaint letter, the two buildings on Prescott Street account for a total of 80 apartments.
“The overall reduction in the number of available housing units in the city, especially in [the] Harvard Square area, evokes all the problems attendant upon a real-life version of the game of musical chairs,” the letter reads.
The letter expressed particular concern for tenants living in rent control units.
Even though the state of Massachusetts eliminated rent control in 1996, Harvard still had several tenants leasing rent controlled units. When the city of Cambridge questioned Harvard about the fate of these tenants, the University decided to allow them to remain in a rent control system.
“Under the swing housing program, each of the tenants of the seven former rent control units are being assisted with finding equivalent housing in another Harvard-owned facility at the same rent as they were paying previously,” Harvard spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson. “In addition to helping these tenants find another unit in the Harvard University Housing portfolio, Harvard will also reimburse these tenants for moving-related expenses.”
Of these tenants, those who wish to lease in buildings outside of the Harvard University Housing portfolios will also receive assistance from Harvard in finding other housing, Neal wrote.
Harvard is giving all residents first pick in lotteries for Harvard-owned units.
But residents said that they are worried because housing is not guaranteed.
“It’s like a competition because all the people who live here [in this building] are looking for Harvard Housing,” Prescott Street resident Alejandra Bueno said. Bueno, who lives with three roommates, said that she is also worried about finding good housing for four people.
Bronwyn C. Roantree, a College Fellow in the Committee on the Study of Religion, has been living on Prescott Street for the past six years.
“It’s a disruption for me, but it’s not traumatic,” Roantree said. “The people whom I am most concerned about...are older and have been living here for 35, 40 years.”

Revisions to Harvard’s planned relocation of campus services to 28 Travis Street in North Allston were met with mixed reactions at a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Tuesday night.
Residents also voiced concern over what they called unsatisfactory and ambiguous plans for improvements to Rena Park and the mixed-use development at Barry’s Corner.
Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, began the meeting by presenting six modifications meant to address community concerns over the relocation of mailroom services, Harvard University Information Technology, Harvard University Police Department training, recycling and storage, and “fleet management services” from 219 Western Avenue to 28 Travis Street. The proposed plan for the project and for the residential and retail commons at Barry’s Corner is slated to go before the Boston Redevelopment Authority board next week.
“My hope is that most of you, if not all of you, will feel comfortable... with Harvard moving forward with the relocation project,” Casey said.
The changes Casey announced included the elimination of Harvard traffic on Travis Street, a commitment to begin planning for Rena Park next month, shuttle access for Allston residents, and a promise to find a suitable location for the Ed Portal in Barry’s Corner.
“[The plan] has been improved by all of your feedback,” Casey said.
After Casey’s presentation, Allston residents expressed concerns that the changes did not address issues like the disruptive sounds emitted by Harvard vehicles.
Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alfred criticized Harvard’s plan to operate the facility throughout the night. But Carl Tempesta, Harvard’s associate director of transit, fleet, and charter, responded that the University plans to construct a new building on Travis Street, which will serve as a noise buffer for the neighborhood. He also said that traffic late at night and early in the morning will be minimal.
Task force members also took issue with Harvard’s promise to “revisit” 28 Travis Street as the suitable location for campus services once the construction of the Allston Science Complex is finished.
“Those totally nebulous terms offer me no assurance whatsoever,” task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said. “The term ‘revisit’ doesn’t tell me a thing.”
Casey responded by saying that the University and task force could change the wording of the proposal before it is reviewed by the BRA board on March 14. However, Casey said that it will be hard to assess the location’s suitability until the science complex is completed.
“We want to make sure there’s a certainty of what’s going to happen,” task force chair Ray V. Mellone said.
The members of the task force recommended approval of the Travis Street relocation under three additional conditions, the first of which was that Harvard agree not to put campus services on or near residential streets. Additionally, the task force requested that Harvard complete construction on Rena Park and move campus services away from Travis Street by the time the science complex is occupied in 2018.
Despite the critique of Harvard’s proposal, some task force members said that they appreciated the University’s attempts to move toward a compromise.
“I thought that your presentation addressed a multitude of things that we are concerned about,” Mellone said. “We’re almost there and I would hate to see us not get there.”
The Travis Street relocation is part of a larger plan for development of Harvard’s property in Allston, including a new basketball arena, a hotel and conference center, and the renovation of Harvard Stadium.

Government professor Michael J. Sandel and University of Chicago professor Jean Bethke Elshtain discussed the role of religion in public life on Tuesday in front of a crowd of more than 500 students and community members in Sanders Theater.
Moderated by Christopher D. Hampson ‘09, the forum gave the professors 15 minutes each to speak about their own opinions on the topic. The talk was followed by a question and answer session between the panelists and then with the audience.
The event was sponsored by The Veritas Forum, a national Christian group “dedicated to the exploration of big questions.” The organization has the mantra that “big questions are best explored together,” according to Terrance Moore ’14 in opening remarks.
“This is an opportunity to take our differences seriously in light of the hardest questions,” Moore said. “Our hope is that everyone will be challenged on both intellectual and spiritual grounds.”
Both Elshtain and Sandel agreed on the importance of incorporating religious beliefs in academic and every-day discourse.
Elshtain, who said she had been criticized for using too many religious references in her work, said it was impossible to separate her public or professional identity from her faith.
“It turns out that what I thought I had rejected had lived on and rose forth in manifold ways,” she said.
Elshtain added that without incorporating religious lessons in all realms of life, “We become more stupid and lose contact with forces that for better or worse made us who we are as persons.”
Sandel agreed with most of Elshtain’s assertions. Like Elshtain, Sandel also disputed the notion that moral and religious convictions should be kept separate from public discourse.
“This view is a mistake,” Sandel said. “It is a mistake for two reasons. First because it’s not always possible to bracket or set aside these views. And second, even in those aspects of public life where we could bracket, doing so would cut ourselves off...from a range of considerations that often matter in the way we govern our lives together.”
Sandel added that incorporating religious views in public discourse would make for a higher level of discourse and a better kind of democratic citizenship.
Brian R. Gifford ’13 said that he agreed with Sandel and Elshtain.
“I’m a Christian, and I’m hoping to do some missionary work abroad next year,” Gifford said. “I found myself in agreement that there needs to be a space to talk to each other about what we believe and even try to persuade each other because that will only help us find truth.”
J. C. Lewis, a local journalist, echoed Gifford’s sentiment.
“Religion informs so much of the history of our consciousness,” he said. “The idea that you could banish it simply makes no sense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A month after administrators announced to a packed University Hall that the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences would move to Allston, Tuesday’s Faculty Meeting was comparatively uneventful, with few attendees and fewer announcements.
While faculty members expected a continuation of last month’s discussion on academic integrity, academic culture on campus was not mentioned until question period.
The second meeting of the semester instead focused on policies to clarify faculty involvement in online education and new findings on gender imbalances in the faculty’s tenured ranks.
TWEAKING THE RULEBOOK
In light of the rapidly growing potential to offer higher education courses online, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith began the meeting by highlighting the need to redraw guidelines on how professors report work done outside of the University. Administrators are currently updating existing policies on reporting outside activity across the University, Smith said.
“We have seen a true explosion in the kinds of opportunities that are before our faculty to do work not only here on this campus, but to explore educational opportunities outside this university,” Smith said.
University President Drew G. Faust echoed Smith’s statements, noting that clear expectations are imperative to ensure that outside work does not detract from the teaching and learning goals of professors on campus.
“How do we sustain that balance between the special obligation to students at Harvard University and meld it with other opportunities?” she said.
The proposed policies would require professors to consult with divisional deans if they wish to distribute educational content over the Internet through non-Harvard platforms, a procedure that some professors said raises questions about ownership and control of educational materials.
“Do these draft principles assume that the University can control any educational content produced by the faculty placed on the internet?” asked English and comparative literature professor James T. Engell ’73. “How can the University control this material if it does not own it?”
The deadline for faculty comment on the draft policies is April 15, a week before next month’s Faculty Meeting.
BALANCING THE RANKS
In the only docketed agenda item of the afternoon, biology professor Elena M. Kramer, chair of the Standing Committee on Women, reported that the percentage of tenured and tenure-track women has leveled out at 25 percent over the last six years—casting Harvard behind some of its peer institutions in terms of gender balance in the faculty. Kramer added that she thinks tenure-track searches would benefit from a more deliberate effort to recruit talented young female academics and hopes that the report will spur further review within individual departments.
“This is very scary to me,” Smith said of the slowed pace at which women are offered tenured-track professorships. “In a noticeable number of places we’re not working hard enough to recognize women and underrepresented minorities to get them into our applicant pools for our tenure-track positions.”
Smith acknowledged the faculty’s need “to do better in this area” and suggested that best practices for hiring women will be considered in the approval of all future faculty searches,
ACADEMICS IN QUESTION
Absent from the Faculty Meeting agenda was a presentation by the Committee on Academic Integrity, which was expected to offer a series of proposals, including a modified honor code, for faculty discussion.
Nevertheless, the issue came up during question period when mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid asked administrators if Harvard has allowed pre-professional interests to overshadow its traditional academic culture.
Citing a Crimson magazine article on the decline of academics at Harvard, Schmidt further wondered whether the intrinsic value of education has been diluted by overemphasizing metrics such as Q scores and easy grading.
Faust said that these questions have already spawned a number of conversations and have influenced the agenda of the Committee on Academic Integrity. Still, she added that all members of the University community need to do a better job reaffirming the importance of academics for their own sake.
“It behooves all of us to think how we as an institution can think about the process of learning, not just the outcomes—the way the act of engaging with academic materials reflects what matters so much to all of us,” Faust said.
Specific proposals from the Committee on Academic Integrity, including a modified honor code, are expected to be formally introduced next month.

CORRECTION: March 6, 2013
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article misquoted Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith as saying, “we’re not working hard enough to recognize women and underrepresented faculty to get them into our tenure tracks.” In fact, Smith expressed concern that in some areas Harvard may not be working hard enough “to recognize women and underrepresented minorities to get them into our applicant pools for our tenure-track positions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James J. Watts ’10 was always up for an adventure—whether it be climbing mountains or unicycling around Widener Library.
“The man was super excited about life,” said former blockmate Isaac S. Shivvers ’10-’11. “He was always excited to be doing what he was doing.”
Watts—an avid mountaineer, loyal friend, and energetic student—passed away in an avalanche Friday while climbing Mt. Washington. He was 24.
Once president of the Harvard Mountaineering Club, Watts loved sharing his passion for the outdoors with experienced and new climbers alike.
“Jimmy was such a true leader, mentor, and friend to so many of us in the club,” said current HMC president Nick B. Waldo ’13 in an email to The Crimson. “It is hard to imagine what the current HMC would look like without him.”
Watts’ adventurous spirit extended into his everyday life, according to Shivvers. Watts created a bouldering route around his sophomore room and could traverse the suite without ever touching the ground. Friends especially remembered his willingness to take risks on behalf of others.
During his junior year at Harvard, Watts took a semester off to work at a drug rehabilitation clinic in Mexico with patients who could not afford rehabilitative drugs.
“He spent every single waking moment with the guy that was recovering from drug addiction,” said Carson H. Weitnauer, who interacted closely with Watts through the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship. “There was no money for drugs; they could only give love, presence, and prayers.”
Indeed, faith was a central tenet of Watts’ life. He was involved in HRCF for all four years of college.
“He pushed everyone to grow spiritually—to grow personally,” said Weitnauer. “Everyone wanted to become more of a Christian like he was.”
Watts’ faith and his commitment to relationships kept him grounded despite a busy schedule at Harvard.
“If we were going out to get food and take a break somewhere, he would join us whether he was hungry or not,” Shivvers said. “He was always willing to put other people in front of his own workload. I don’t think he ever made an enemy.”
Throughout college, Watts dated his high school sweetheart Cassidy J. Ray, whom he married last spring.
“Anyone who saw him with Cassidy, they knew that there was something tremendously special there,” said former blockmate Sam L. Linden ’10.
Watts was a medical student at Columbia University when he died. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he wrote a thesis in Biochemical Sciences while working in a laboratory during his spare time.
“He was a very eager student,” said biochemistry professor Jack L. Strominger, under whom Watts worked for four years. “Some students come to work in your lab because they think it will help them get into med school. That wasn’t Jimmy. He was really interested in doing research, always pushing to be independent.”
Watts never gave up this excitement for new ideas.
“With him gone, there’s a part of my future that won’t be there anymore,” Shivvers said. “He won’t be a part of these little adventures. That’s what I’m going to miss the most.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing two EIVA conference games this weekend, Harvard men’s volleyball swept MIT, 3-0, on Tuesday night at the Malkin Athletic Center.
The road losses put the Crimson (10-4, 5-3 EIVA) in fourth place in the conference. With a three-day turnaround, coach Brian Baise believed the key was his team’s mentality.
“Coming off those tough league losses, I wanted us to be loose and I wanted us to be aggressive,” Baise said. “Most importantly, [today] we were focused and we were confident.”
It was a close first game for Harvard, which escaped with a narrow 25-23 victory. The Engineers (11-10) held a lead for nearly the entire set, until an attack error pushed the score to 21 apiece. The two teams exchanged the next four points until the Crimson was able to seal the win.
“One of the first things you remember when you step onto the court is your mistakes from the last time,” said junior co-captain and outside hitter Nick Madden, referring to the uncomfortably tight first frame.
“The challenge is to be tough enough to get over that,” Madden said. “Being able to let go of your past mistakes and then move onto the next point.”
MIT’s offensive efforts were strongest in the first frame, where the Engineers registered 14 of their 33 kills on the night.
Senior Matt Hohenberger led the Engineers with 10 kills.
“Our defense wasn’t closing our blocks very well, which was probably the biggest difference I saw between games one and two,” said Madden.
Harvard took an early lead in the second game but allowed MIT to climb back and knot the score at 11. After calling its first time out of the night, the Crimson returned to the floor and finished the game in convincing fashion, winning 25-17.
In the third frame, the two teams traded points until Harvard gained an 11-8 edge. The Crimson was able to hold on to its lead this time, winning the final stanza 25-19.
“I’m glad we had the fortitude and strength to come back after the first game,” Madden said. “We came back and got those last points we needed and then continued in the last two games.”
Junior libero Chris Gibbons had 11 digs for Harvard, four more than MIT’s defensive specialist Brendan Chang. The Crimson’s 34 digs on the night outpaced the Engineers’ 25.
“Especially after the first game, I thought our defense was excellent,” Braise said.
“Chris was all over the back row,” Madden said. “He was really loud [and] really the general of the back row tonight. I give him my player of the game honors tonight.”
At the net, Harvard gathered a total of eight blocks, five better than MIT. The Crimson held its opponent to a .180 kill percentage.
“[As the game progressed] middle blockers were doing a good job of locating the ball and clamping down on it, as [was] our defense behind the ball,” Gibbons said.
Middle blockers sophomore Celeb Zimmick and junior Kyle Rehkemper added five and three blocks respectively.
“We have been working a lot with our middle blockers,” Baise said. “They have been doing great... I thought our defense was excellent tonight.”
Harvard picked up seven service aces compared to three from the Engineers.
“The guys were hitting their serves hard tonight,” Baise said.
Baise pointed to team cohesion as an important factor differentiating the play on Tuesday from the losses over the weekend.
“We didn’t play well as a team [last weekend],” Baise said. “When we play well and communicate, we do well, which we did tonight. I think that was the main difference.”
Gibbons echoed his coach, sharing similar sentiments.
“I thought it was a good comeback from a rough weekend,” said Gibbons. “It was good for helping out the team’s confidence. MIT was definitely a team we needed to beat, and we did.”
The Crimson will have just one day to rest and recuperate before facing crosstown foe Emmanuel College on Thursday.
“Working on those blocks is going to be key,” said Madden. “Our serving was spot on tonight, which we were able to hold at a consistent level. We’re going to work on maintaining that consistency and momentum going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 7 p.m. last Friday evening at Lavietes Pavilion, with 33 straight Ivy League wins under their belt, the Princeton women’s basketball team seemed poised to move even closer to a fourth consecutive Ancient Eight crown. Senior Niveen Rasheed, the league’s leading scorer at 17 points per game, had led her team to victory in every conference game this season by an average margin of 33 points, and she showed no signs of slowing down anytime soon.  The Tigers looked unstoppable.
But stoppable they certainly were. Over two halves, Harvard dismantled Princeton, holding their opponent to 25.8-percent shooting from the field, nearly 20 percent lower than their season average. Rasheed found herself suffocated by Crimson defenders, hitting just 3-of-12 field goal attempts.
The last time the seniors of the Tiger squad, who had gone 50-1 in their Ivy careers to that point, saw a loss? Feb. 4, 2011. And the team that dealt this blemish to an otherwise perfect season? Harvard.
One could dismiss this week’s upset victory as a fluke, an instance of a greater team simply choking. But this game really was a Crimson win, the materialization of an upward trend and a quest for vengeance.
Rebounding from road losses at the Killer P’s and still mindful of a blowout at Dartmouth back in January, Harvard has played its past four games, all at home, to convincing wins.
Since the humbling 67-51 loss at Jadwin, the Crimson has shot at an average of 44.2 percent from the field and drilled over a quarter of its attempts from deep, even while missing standout three-point shooter Emma Golen. Junior guard Christine Clark has scored at least 14 points in each contest, while senior forward Victoria Lippert has broken the 20-point mark in three of the four games.
But it has been far from a two-women show. Amidst a rash of injuries, Elle Hagedorn has stepped up as an athletic guard with the ability to beat practically any defender off the dribble. The senior has seen her playing time increased to nearly 30 minutes per contest over the past four games and taken advantage, grabbing boards and displaying much-improved ball control skills.
In the frontcourt, forwards Miriam Rutzen and Temi Fagbenle have provided power on the glass. Fagbenle, in particular, has used her 6’4” frame to cut down opponents’ second chance shots with defensive rebounds.
The Crimson has knocked visiting opponents off of their offensive games. Starting with Brown on Feb. 22, opponents’ shooting percentage has fallen steadily. In Harvard’s last outing, a convincing 67-54 win over the Quakers last Saturday, Crimson defenders stifled Penn to dismal 6.3-percent shooting late in the first half.
But the team’s dominance in recent weeks isn’t adequately captured by improved statistics alone. The women of Harvard basketball have played with heart, with their coach Kathy Delaney-Smith frequently reminding them of how they’ve erred in the past.
“We should have never lost to Penn the first time,” Delaney-Smith said. “We should have never lost to Dartmouth the second time. Those are huge errors we knew would come back to haunt us a little bit. But stranger things have happened; many Ivy champions have had three losses.”
Previously facing a potential third place finish in the Ancient Eight, Harvard moved a step up the conference standings to second place this weekend, tied with Penn.
The Crimson now faces three more Ivy tests, Cornell and Columbia twice. The race for the conference title has opened up a little for the first time in several years.
Princeton left Cambridge evidently shaken by their scuffle with Harvard. The next night they traveled to Hanover and left with their slimmest margin of victory over a league opponent yet. Trailing at the half by three points, the Tigers fought for a narrow 68-60 win.
For Harvard women’s basketball, the pieces fell into place this weekend to break Princeton and continue a streak of its own.

The cozy feeling behind snowy tunes like "Baby It’s Cold Outside" and "Let It Snow" only lasts several days past Christmas. Now it's almost spring break, and yes, it's still snowing and raining and sleeting. Good ol' Cambridge. To keep you warm and dry and a little less miserable today and tonight, here are some "warm cuts" on campus.
Thayer. Right in the middle of the Yard, Thayer has proven that the joys of freshman year will last throughout our time here: take a walk down memory lane as you enjoy its shelter and freshman innocence for a solid 2-3 minutes.
Annenberg. This one involves stairs, but for those of us headed to CGIS or the Art Museum from the Yard, it pays to head downstairs and cut across Memorial Hall for a quick warm cut. A little exercise is never a bad thing. Bonus: hit up Flyby and get yourself some warm soup while you're there.
Science Center. This building occupies some real fine real estate. You can easily take a warm cut to the Harvard Law School (head left) or to the neighborhood of science buildings up on Oxford Street (walk to the back and turn right).
Holyoke Center. To get to Mt. Auburn St., forget going down Holyoke Street, also known as Cambridge's worst wind tunnel—go through the Holyoke Center, and enjoy the smells of Oggi and Al's as you make your way through, perfectly warm and dry.
Mallinckrodt Lab. Humanities concentrators should be jealous. Somehow, the Mallinckrodt Lab just happens to be built as one of the longest warm cuts on campus: it runs along Oxford Street beginning from the Science Center and ending seemingly never. This wins the warm cut award: Anyone headed to SEAS, the Peabody Museum, or Hoffman Lab can seek refuge from wintry weather for a full 3-4 minutes.

With one day to go until administrators and representatives of University Health Services sit down at Thursday's much-anticipated "Mental Health Town Hall," students are refining, submitting, and voting on questions that aim to demystify Harvard's mental health resources and procedures.
The Undergraduate Council-sponsored event—which features a panel of guests, including representatives of the AdBoard, Harvard Mental Health Services, the Financial Aid Office, the Office of Student Life, and Student Mental Health Liaisons—will run from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday in Emerson 105.
According to Paul J. Barreira, director of University Health Services, the panel will be moderated by a neutral facilitator, and though there may be some matters of fact presented at the event, the majority of time will be devoted to open question and response.
Questions already submitted via a UC-promoted Google Doc touch on a wide-range of mental health issues, from the availability of self-help books to the scope of confidentiality between students, UHS, and the administration.
Here, in order, are the top five questions as of Wednesday afternoon:
1. How does Harvard plan to improve the system for student advocates during the AdBoard process in light of recent academic and health concerns?
2. What rights and limits of confidentiality exist between the student and UHS, tutors and residential staff, and the Ad Board? How can we increase transparency?
3. Would the university consider subsidizing mental health costs for those on a leave of absence who met full-financial aid requirements? Extending our student plans currently costs >$1000, which may be significant burden starting off on leave.
4. The system at Harvard works with the extremes, meaning healthy students thrive & students about to commit suicide can be seen overnight. How does Harvard plan to address the middle - so students aren't forced to get worse before they can get better?
5. Will Harvard commit to abolishing the de facto policy of persuading students to take leave of absence, except where medically necessary?"

Welcome to "Listen Up!," Flyby's weekly advice column, written by two jobless, washed-up seniors from their futon in Winthrop.
We rounded up some of your most poignant questions from last week and responded with our unfailing wisdom.
Q: Help! I have a crush on my ex-TF. I thought my feelings would die after our class, but the fire of love is still burning strong. What should I do?
A: Apply to your TF's graduate program, obviously. Need a rec? Guess who can write it!
And the next time a TF catches your eye, don't wait so long to make a move. This is what by-appointment office hours are for.
 
 
Q. I've been interested in this guy for almost three years now, but we've never had a real conversation. I see him practically every day, and now we're running out of time because we are both seniors. Any advice on how to approach and befriend him?
 
A: We have a similar problem with a guy, in that we've been looking at pictures of Ryan Gosling practically every day for three years now and also have yet to have a real conversation with him.
We won't judge you for sounding creepy, mostly because that would be hypocritical (but FYI you are a little bit creepy). Honestly though, it's senior spring. If we hadn't made fun of Twitter acronyms in our post last week, we would probably say YOLO or something. Since actually approaching him out of the blue would most likely be terrifying for both you and him, find a mutual friend to introduce you to your target the guy. Make sure to floss before the big moment and—BAM!—your life will now change forever. Jk. But it will be something to look forward to other than reading the HUDS menu daily and praying for a miracle.
 
Q: How do I get a boyfriend? It's so hard to date at Harvard. —Lonelygirl
 
A: Is it? Because we've personally found ourselves in an endless cycle of meaningful, committed relationships with perfect gentlemen since the day we arrived at college with our suitcases full of Ramen and our hearts full of love, ready to share both with the right person.
 
Boyfriends aren't really a thing at Harvard. You know, like "academic integrity" and "mental health services." They're similar to bangs: some girls manage to pull them off, while others think they can and end up looking like idiots. For the record, historically we've been told that we "just don't have the right kind of face" for either.
 
Renowned philosopher Beyoncé once said, "If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it." In college, however, if you like it then you shouldn't put a label on it (oh oh oh). Lower your standards. But take comfort in knowing that you aren't alone in being alone. We're alone too, which is why we have time to write this column.
 
 
 
 
Q: How do I make new friends? I love my current ones, but as a second semester sophomore, I'm yearning for a change of pace and new adventures. Harvard has so many brilliant people that I want to know, but I feel like that boat has already set sail.
 
A: *Ship.
 
Just the other day, Sarah made a new friend in the Yard by talking loudly about how ridiculous it was that Linsday made it into the final two on the Bachelor this season, so you can always employ the strategy of yelling your opinions about popular topics of conversation in public spaces and seeing who responds. (This really happened, and girl with red hair/cigarette in hand, I don't remember your name but thank you for agreeing that Catherine is the superior choice for Sean).
If this sounds slightly unreasonable, friends of friends are a great starting point. There is even an easy screening process, which is called Facebook, that you can use to see which friends of your friends seem like good candidates to be your friends, too. Are you looking for a worldly friend? Find someone with cover photos and profile pictures taken around the globe with captions such as "Ghana is my real home" and "take me back to [exotic location] now please!" How about someone artistic or musical? Search for a person who has created an "artist's page" on Facebook and has asked everyone to like it—multiple times.
 
Another great way to pick is to see which friends of your friends like your comments on your friends' photos the most. If they think you are clever or insightful before meeting you, that's one less hoop to jump through in the real friendship. Crash a couple of meals, get introduced, and make a dent in meeting all these brilliant people you say exist here.
 
Have issues? We can help!
Maybe.

Love and Life Lessons,
Sarah and Julia
