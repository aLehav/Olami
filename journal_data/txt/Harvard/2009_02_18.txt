In tough times, there is nothing quite like a moment in the lap of luxury. But comfort can get expensive. Fond of facials? Book yourself a spa treatment—a phone call later and you’ve dropped $50 at Pyara. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m here to announce that I have stumbled upon one of the best-kept secrets in the business of steamed pampering. It lies at the intersection of stress management, fine dining, and salon services: at a shabu-shabu restaurant a facial comes rolled up, or rather, bubbling out of, your Japanese hot pot dinner. ABOUT A HOT POTThe hot pot meal is a comfort food tradition widespread throughout Asia, though shabu-shabu specifically refers to the Japanese version. The basic rubric includes a steaming pot of broth (usually beef, chicken, or miso) kept boiling over a tabletop electric burner in which one drops vegetables, followed by raw pieces of top sirloin beef, chicken, tofu, or, less traditionally, seafood. The cooked chunks are then fished out, dunked in ponzu (a combination of soy and citrus) or sesame sauce mixed by the preparer, and consumed over a bowl of rice. Loosely translated, the name means “swish-swish,” is perhaps meant to imitate the sound of the bits of food as they hit the boiling water.“Shabu-shabu was historically eaten by Genghis Kahn and his hordes of fierce warriors as they trekked across the harsh terrains of Central Asia,” touts the Web site of the square’s latest addition to its shabu landscape, Shabu-Ya. The restaurant is owned by the same guys who operate another Asian fusion restaurant directly below Shabu-Ya, Shilla. According to one over-eager, smiley waiter, soldiers made the first hot pot out of their general’s helmet. “However, you don’t have to endure the life of a warrior to enjoy this simple, delicious dish.” Fact? I think not. One ill-fated Friday night, my dinner experience at the three-month old Shabu-Ya was akin to what I imagine one might have endured at the Baths of Caracalla in Ancient Rome.STEAMBATH FOR THREETwo unassuming, unnamed, but thankfully adventurous eaters accompanied me to the wasteland of a building that houses Staples along with much of Harvard Square’s own Little Asia. Between Wagamama, Bombay Café, Shilla, 9 Tastes and Om, this stretch of JFK Street is a hot pot of its own. We ascended a single dismal flight of stairs, passed the noticeably empty noodle joint, Wagamama (perhaps, thanks to this reviewer), and an eyebrow-raising view into the seedy kitchen of the Bombay Café, only to find ourselves filled with trepidation at the doorstep of Shabu-Ya. The restaurant’s psychedelic décor creates an aura one might situate somewhere between the Jetsons’ house and a Food Network set. To quote one recent Harvard diner, “It’s like Little Tokyo over Staples.” Although reservations weren’t necessary, the place was fairly packed for dinner. As either a party restaurant or a date destination, shabu-style dining does the trick—it ensures lots interactive fun and the discussion that goes with it.But, here’s the clincher: “Our interior design concept places you right inside a pot of shabu-shabu,” says the restaurant’s self-analyzing Web site. “The pink and green seating invokes the meats and vegetables while the playful light fixtures bring to mind the bubbles in a boiling pot of broth.” Nothing could be closer to the truth. In true foodie form, each of us proceeded to order one of the various shabus. Playing it safe, I opted for a mixed tofu platter and miso broth. Options include the classic chicken or beef stock, and, in a gesture towards Vietnam, tom yum. Something about having to monitor simmering raw chicken tenders gave me the willies. An inordinate number of minutes later, our waiter returned to our hot pink booth with the pots, and we began to dunk away.  At this moment in most restaurants reviews, the reviewer usually waxes poetic on the quality of the meal, its highlights and disappointments outlined in detail. But that night, the occurrence of a sauna effect in our circular enclave in the restaurant’s windowed corner combined with my inability to grip my pen through my drenched palms prohibited me from tasting much or taking meaningful notes. As the rising steam opened wide our pores and nostrils to the scents of soy and sesame, I instead wrote notes to my fellow diners in the condensation on the windows behind us. The restaurant desperately needs some form of soundtrack (the B-52s, anyone?) beyond the sound of bubbles and diner laughter. Definitely wash the shabu down with one of the bar’s stellar plum, raspberry, or lychee saketinis which, trust me when I say, will prove a real lifesaver as your steam bath progresses. The other menu items are fairly typical, although the sushi option provides a welcome respite from your shabu shower or a decent alternative for the shabu-wary. Shabu-Ya is absolutely not inexpensive (especially if you do appetizers and drinks), but at around $35 a head plus a facial, it comes in a helluva lot less than a trip to Pyara.Down Winthrop Street from Shabu-Ya is Shabu Square, quietly located at the corner of Eliot Street. The menu at this far less expensive knock-off is based on a similar template of shabu plus other pan-Asian delights. The stark décor and often-challenged food—despite some successful personalizable noodle dishes—are probably not worth the 15 bucks, though rest assured that the ceiling height facilitates a fairly steam-free shabu experience. That being said, if you’re brave enough to lean out over the fake wood table so as to position your face directly above your hot pot, you may just have found the most economical hybrid spa/restaurant special around.CHECK, PLEASEWhen I left school last spring before studying abroad in France, the land of cheese and chocolate, Harvard Square was shabu-free. I returned to what seemed like shabu-ville, with a higher concentration of the joints than should be allowed in a single block. Any time a real restaurant wants to park its pot in the Square, I’d welcome more than a bowl of soup.

Jill Lepore may be known around Harvard as the head honcho of the Hist and Lit Department. But during her downtime she’s been cultivating another personality: a colorful, 18th-century Scottish painter named Stewart Jameson, protagonist in her debut novel, “Blindspot.” Lepore co-authored the book, which is a parody of, and homage to, 18th-century style, with Brandeis history professor Jane Kamensky. “Blindspot” tells the story of romance and intrigue in Revolutionary War-era Boston. FM sat down with the historian  for a coffee chat about time travel and 18th-century debauchery.  1.Fifteen Minutes [FM]: How did you and Jane meet each other? Jill Lepore [JL]: We met in graduate school, we were both at Yale in the early nineties and we both had dogs. We met each other, I think, at the dog park. 2. FM: You two decided to write the novel as a birthday present for a friend? JL: He was actually our graduate student mentor at Yale, John Demos. When an academic retires, his graduate students usually hold a conference to celebrate his work. Jane and I decided that for our piece of the conference we were going to write character sketches that were a send-up of 18th-century genre fiction. It took us a week to write these character sketches, and it was fun. So we kept going, and before we knew it we’d batted back and forth 100 pages.3. FM: What was the time frame? JL: We started writing in December and finished in June. 4. FM: Was it all via e-mail? Did you ever collaborate in person? JL: It was almost all via e-mail. We decided we needed to take advantage of the fact that there were two of us, and settled on this dual-narrated single novel. I wrote Jameson’s chapters, which are a very campy version of the 18th-century picaresque. Jane wrote a sentimental epistolary novel that’s like “Clarissa.” There are several places in the novel where the characters are in the same place at the same time and both narrate the scene; when we wrote those we did that together at one another’s house. We’d share a laptop and pass it back and forth. 5. FM: It seems like you’re trying to reinvent the genre of historical writing to make it more relevant and imaginative, as opposed to dry and traditional. How much of your genre do you think the market can bear? JL: I don’t know if it can bear any of it. (Laughs) The thrill is to do it. Part of the conceit of the novel is that it was supposed to be written as if it were written in 1764, and so there’s a lens through which the characters see the world that’s not entirely bearable for a contemporary reader. Most modern readers aren’t out there reading “Clarissa.” Have you? FM: Nope! JL: Yeah. It’s long. It seems hackneyed, because it’s the origin of these further conventions, so we couldn’t actually keep complete fidelity to the sensibility.6.FM: It seems that you’re hoping it will be kind of a gateway drug into these 18th-century novels. What would you hope that a reader would gain just by reading it? JL: I do wish that it brought people to read more 18th-century fiction and historical materials. The book is supposed to sort of make the reader the historian... it is totally didactic in that sense, not as a “gateway drug” to 18th-century fiction, but ideally to get people excited about reading history in a different way. 7. FM: If you could go back in time and convince one person in that period to write a diary, who would it be? JL: Well, I don’t want to go back in time. It is very frustrating as a social historian that there are so few of certain kinds of documents. In the last history book that I wrote, which is about a slave rebellion in New York, the chief evidentiary obstacle was that the words attributed to the accused are these confessions that are referred to as “Negro evidence.” The originals were burned in a fire in 1911, so all that survives are highly edited versions of a confession beaten out of somebody who spoke another language, who didn’t know how to read and write. So I would love for there to be some authentic statement by one of those guys, but the conditions of history don’t make it possible. It’s a counterfactual. 8.FM: Speaking of counterfactuals, what would the reception of the novel have been if it were released in 1764? JL: It’s just like every other [18th-century] novel. 9. FM: But earlier you said it was kind of faster paced. JL: It has to be somehow legible to a modern reader. It is quite overwrought, and it’s also quite campy, but it’s not nearly as overwrought and campy as that stuff. The novel was considered pernicious; it was a new form, considered debauched, and it played on those conventions. 10.FM: Speaking of debauchery, did you follow 18th-century standards of bawdiness or those of contemporary American novels with this novel? JL: Well the bawdiness is itself utterly 18th-century. In terms of modern convention, it’s probably very discreet. 11. FM: You have a lot of inside jokes and anachronisms. When you include an Edgar Allan Poe reference, for instance, is that just an inside joke that only a handful of readers would catch? JL: 18th-century fiction is itself very pastiche-y, there’s a lot of cut-and-paste quality to it, and there’s a lot of lampooning. It’s not meant to be arch; it’s fine if you don’t get it. If you do, maybe it’s amusing. 12.FM: If you wrote a historical paper, you would hope that people judge you by your insight. How should people judge you through this work? Is it just a romp?JL: It would be very easy to make too much of it. Yes, it is a romp. But also, because we really care about this period, it’s an attempt to get out of a kind of stalled debate in American historical scholarship between an economic interpretation of the American revolution and an intellectual interpretation. 13.FM: It seems like in 200 years, social historians will have a wealth of blogs, archives, and other documentation to work with. How do you think that will change the game, if at all?  JL: I think a lot of that stuff, from the historian’s point of view, is pretty noisy. Even the 19th century gets kind of noisy to me, it can be hard to sort through where real patterns are to be found. I don’t know that I think that it necessarily makes the historian’s task easier to have more stuff. 14. FM: If you had a question to ask Jameson or any of the people he’s modeled after, what would it be? JL: They can only tell us what they’ve already told us. I often get that question... my relationship to the past doesn’t feel that way. I think it just comes from a different set of assumptions. 15.FM: So as a historian, how would you characterize your understanding of these people’s lives relative to that of their contemporaries? JL: You usually know how it’s going to end. One of the really fun things about working on a novel was knowing how certain things ended, but not knowing how everything ended.

Does Eliot House have enough drama to sustain its very own gossip blog?  One Harvard student, who chooses to remain anonymous, thinks so. Enter The EL Word, which is, according to its blogger, “your one and only source into the scandalous lives of the Eliot elite.”The EL Word first began posting “gossip” in mid-January and still has relatively few entries—most of which are observational:“A senior boys’ blocking group is conducting a facial hair competition,” EL announced in its second post. Other posts offer less obvious information. “Sorry, ladies. It looks like your favorite Irish GZ senior may not be so single anymore,” said El. For Eliot residents, The El Word is not necessarily a source of juicy information. “It’s usually just stuff that everybody knows anyway,” said Eliot resident William C. Newell ’11.Newly elected Eliot HoCo Chair, Michael F. Ayoub ’10 (dubbed “Slayoub” by EL) doesn’t mind the notoriety of being featured on the blog. “I thought it was funny,” he says. “It was all in good play, just surprising to see myself there.”John J. Brady ’10, another Eliot resident, sees the blog in a different light. “I don’t know anyone who they’re talking about,” said Brady, “if these people were so elite and fantastic I think I would know about them.”Regardless of individual student reception, The EL Word seems to function as the newest form of inter-house communication, tailored for the habits and needs of 21st century students. A post to the Eliot house list, advertising the Inferno, the Eliot Grille, faddressed the blog directly. “Dear El,” the e-mail read. “Word on the street is that The Inferno’s going to be cooking up some juicy gossip and even juicier burgers tonight. Better watch out—those mozz sticks are going to be HOT.” In the words of the infamous Gossip Girl, “You’re no one until you’re talked about.” Welcome to Harvard’s media scene, El. Hope you can keep up.

It is clear that the economy is struggling when even Harvard University, the Lil’ Wayne of higher education, has to make budget cuts. Having seen the pains of these cuts across our campus, Prestige and Mobility decided to put on our investigative “journalist” caps/jumpsuits and get to the bottom of this. [1] 
Of course, Chiappini had once stood on top of the world of investigative journalism as the New York Times’s society columnist for Teddy Bear Picnics. That was until Bilotti revealed that Chiappini had been writing laudatory articles in order to secure invitations to the most exclusive Teddy Bear Picnics. Needless to say, his funding was cut. 
We went looking for “the scoop” around University Hall. We tried to keep our ears to the pavement—you gotta hit the sidewalk if you want “the dirt!” We even crashed a luncheon, trying to get “the dish.” After following all of our “leads,” we ended up in a professor’s office decorated with Lisa Frank posters, but it turned out that Harvey Mansfield was a dead “end” as well. 
Eventually, an anonymous source in University Hall told us just what Our Queen Drew Faust was up to. Apparently, the University’s greatest expense is its enormous phone bill. In response Our Queen Drew Faust, as part of her overall plan to eliminate undergraduate happiness, will soon order all students to “donate” their cell phone minutes to the University and only use their University-issued red phones for the remainder of their college careers. [2] 
Where are all these minutes going? Well, the “crack” team of Prestige and Mobility have the answer. First, the majority of minutes go to Registrar Barry S. Kane for his many 1-900 calls to the “Pokemon Snap” tip line. [4] Many of the minutes obviously go to Prof. Michael Sandel and his attempts to redeem his Joe Camel points and finally get the leather jacket he’s been pining for—what utility! Over in Littauer, Prof. Greg Mankiw still manages to rack up several hours on the ol’ “electronic” banana with vaunted capitalist Scrooge McDuck. [5] 
It is also in every faculty member’s contract that they receive a minimum of three congratulatory phone calls from Our Queen Drew Faust. “Hey Prof. Michael Herzfeld. I love what you’re doing on ‘social poetics.’ You’ve made it to Harvard. You can do anything!” “Hey Prof. Sarah Jansen! I love what you’re doing on dogs and how we know them! You’re improving humanity with every paw you ask for! You’re important! You’re at the top of your field!” “Hey Registrar Barry S. Kane! Damnnnnnn. I mean, damnnnnnn. Delicious.” 
For those who are complaining about the red phones, remember the examples of your forefathers. FDR had the first red phone, though he rarely used it, preferring instead to walk to a friend’s room to chat. Chief Justice John G. Roberts and his blockmates often “judged” girls over his red phone, issuing his famous dissenting opinion in the case of Mediocre Asian Girl v. Learned Hand (1975). Mark Zuckerberg invented Facebook after too many girls hung up on him when he called to ask for their hometowns, dates of birth, and “favorite interests.” Most famously, while simultaneously dating two “cubanas” in an elite female final club, JFK accidentally telephoned the wrong one, sparking the epic catfight and subsequent standoff known to historians as the “Cuban Miscall Isis.” 
A common concern among students is that they will only be able to call other Harvard affiliates. Well, what need do you have for people who didn’t get into Harvard? We’re your family now, united by a love of money, high SAT scores, and a lifelong insecurity complex that seeks a confirmation of status and worth that could never be found in the arms of a parent or friend. You’ll die alone, but you’ll die snuggled inside a quilted Harvard afghan and you’ll be buried with your class ring—until marauding bands of grave robbers snap it from your decaying finger. But seriously kids, use those red phones.  

[1] For embroidery and pricing, call 3-2126.
[2] Harvard’s plan to eliminate all fun also includes the following programs: cable TV, party grants, the Girl Talk fiasco, inviting Insane Clown Posse to YardFest 2009, appropriating Nazi gold, not admitting any hot girls, the Lamont Burrito Disaster of 2005, lethargic calendar reform, Vanserg, serving squash at 78.3 percent of meals, and the Core.[3]
[3] This is the longest footnote in Crimson history.

It may comfort some to see the spirit of domestic exclusivity alive and well on Harvard’s campus, well after the housing process became truly random. The Eliot House Committee, in an attempt to retain their erstwhile elite status, has taken this entitlement to a new, breezier level: by taking off their pants.Dimitry A. Doohovskoy ’09, Eliot HoCo Co-chair, organized a “Pants-less Dining Experience” for the residents of Eliot House last Thursday. In a vehement e-mail over the Eliot House list, Doohovskoy instructed Eliotites to drop trowsers “when the 6 o’clock signal is given” to promote “Eliot anti-interloper Solidarity”.“Animosity is sometimes another word for jealousy,” said Doohovskoy, brushing off the possibility of the pants-less protest generating ill will. To the contrary, Doohovskoy said the protest may spur a “revolution” among houses facing a similar plight. “I think that Eliot is always an inspiration to other houses, who sort of have to follow our lead in a lot of things,” he said, “it’s not their fault. It’s just, you know, we have a great HoCo...and we have great House life.” Although pantsless participants numbered well over 50, many Eliot and non-Eliot students alike seemed disinterested. Several non-participants cited their preference for bottoms as the main reason for remaining clothed. When asked whether she takes interest in HoCo activites, Kelsey A. Maguire ’11 asked what “HoCo” was.“I don’t really think people care that much,”  said Eliot resident Lauren T. Brown ’10, who participated in the event. Brown was indifferent about Eliot earning a reputation from the event. “So what? People in Eliot are really weird.” “I’m glad I don’t live in Eliot,” declared Dunster House resident Leah R. Schwartz ’11, adding, “Eliot sucks.” Schwartz, a Radcliffe rower, is one of the many athletes who frequent Eliot dining hall. Unfazed by the pantsless dining episode, she asserted that she will continue her regular interhouse dining in defiance of the Eliot HoCo.Despite mixed reactions, Doohovskoy remained hopeful for the future: “On Welcome Day, we’ll see how the freshmen react.”

This semester, it may become a whole lot more common to hear people commenting on that annoying bitch or hot hound in lecture. But with History of Science 137: “Dogs and How We Know Them,” a new course offered this semester, Professor Sarah Jansen is getting a pack of students drooling over the study of canines in the classroom.  Jansen, whose course focuses on the role that dogs have played throughout history, is no newcomer to the study of four-legged animals. “The very first research paper that I ever wrote was about dogs,” said Jansen, who is also an experienced dog trainer.The class has received an overwhelming response and currently has more than 100 students enrolled. But the study of the canis genus is not confined to the classroom. Some students’ tails are wagging over the optional trips to dog pounds and rescue shelters that Jansen will offer throughout the semester. “I’m really excited about the optional trips. I’ve never been to an animal rescue place,” said Megan E. Popkin ’11. “I’ve been to a pound and I was devastated. So I’m really excited about that.” But while the class may allow students to indulge in their puppy love, it also features an eclectic reading list, with assignments ranging from investigative pieces such as “Pill-Popping Pets,” to quirky epics such as Virginia’s Woolf’s “Flush, a Biography.” Although students might reasonably assume that their pets would want to attend lecture, the dogs on campus may not all agree. “We have one active service dog attending and he fell asleep during class, so I think it’s pretty boring for dogs,” Jansen said. Many students, however, seem to be excited about the opportunity to teach their canine friends a thing or two. “I’ve always had dogs running around at home, so I think it would be great if people could bring dogs to class,” said Alexandra P. Kass ’10.Even if their furry friends may not agree, Jansen’s class will surely leave its two-legged students with something to chew on.

As grant-writing season gets underway, FM lets you know that you might be in better shape than you think. Your proposal could look like this one.
Grant: The Isenberg Fellowship for theater studies (summer study of theater, broadly defined, and preferably in England).
Brief Synopsis of Proposal: As a freshman at Harvard College with an intense interest in the thespian arts, I plan to do in-depth and ground-breaking research on an obscure regional playwright, William Shakespeare. Unbeknownst to the rest of Western society, he has turned out what may be the best plays in Greater Stratford-upon-Avon, if not up to and including all its suburbs! 
My secondary project concerns Shakespeare’s rap songs. One gem, obviously inspired by Shakespeare’s contemporary, notorious rhymester DJ Time, flows: “And nothing ‘gainst Time’s scythe can make defense / Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.” My work in this field will be focused on unearthing the historical origins and literary manifestations of the feud between the DJ and the flow doctor. 
I find myself qualified for this fellowship because of the success of my previous research on Shakespeare’s son-nets; I’ve discovered that the genre’s name comes from the practice of emcee’s opening their flows with the statement, “Yo, yo, I’m about to make you my son.” The infatuated crowds termed them “son-nets.” These poems caught opponents as they became, derogatorily, “sons”. Because scribes became fatigued copying down the rhymes after 14 or so lines, son-nets never reached epic poem length. 
Brief Description of Your Career Plans:  
Investment Banker or, if all else fails, son-neteer.   
Locations of your project and approximate length of stay: 
U.S. Virgin Islands, three weeks (There is evidence that the poet sent his last works here to be buried, something about white sands and luxury hotels.  I will investigate.) 
Barbados, one week (Recuperating).

There’s a new book about the Harvard football team on the stands, and—surprisingly—it reveals that the some of the biggest guys on campus have a sensitive side. But the real surprise is that the author is only four years old. Zachary Malott, who goes by “Zach”, was inspired to write his book, “I’m with the Team,” after checking out the Harvard stadium last year and watching the football team practice with his dad, a longtime Crimson fan. Mike H. Malott, Zach’s father, remembers the first day that Zach stood with his sign reading, “please sign my football.”“As they came out, every single one stopped, waited in a line backed up to sign my kid’s football,” says Malott, “I thought, ‘I can’t believe this!’”From that day on, Zach, who struggles with autism, became a regular face at practice, becoming the team’s unofficial mascot and water boy throughout the summer and into the fall. According to Malott’s father, the experience was “the best therapy [Zach has] ever seen.” “Zach never spoke until he was involved with the team,” his father says, “those guys are unbelievable. I can’t even explain it; it’s almost magical.”According to Tim L. Murphy, head coach of the Harvard football team, the feeling was mutual. “He was just one of those kids that was easy to embrace,” says Murphy when asked about Zach, “because he was just an adorable child. Everyone on our team felt an attraction and empathy towards him naturally, like they would to any other child like him.”Zach’s book, which made its debut in Cambridge and Boston bookstores on Valentine’s Day, highlights the youngster’s experience with the team, and includes fun facts about Harvard football from a four-year-old’s perspective. According to Ben E. Newcomer of the Harvard Bookstore, Zach’s book has garnered much interest among patrons, including notables such as President Faust. Zach is probably the youngest author to write about Harvard’s football team and (sorry Sports page) he’s definitely the cutest.

Frustrated by the endless variety of squash? Bothered by a dining service seemingly bent on destruction of the avian class? Or just plain flabbergasted at how all these people can get by without dessert forks? Welcome to Umami Magazine, Harvard’s newest guide to the world of finer dining.
The magazine’s launch party last Thursday evening went down more smoothly than a fine Port. While some came for the more generic fare, as hordes descended upon pizza and sushi, there was also filet mignon for the connoisseurs. But regardless of taste, gourmands were united by a love of food, and even more, by a love of getting away from dining halls. 
“The process of scooping out food and putting it on a plate is just the antithesis of dining,” said Ritchell R. van Dams ’11, a guest at the launch and bimonthly patron of Manhattan dining establishments. 
Umami editor-in-chief Christine W. Li ’10 also emphasized the escape that restaurants offer. “It’s great to get away from the atmosphere of academics, pressure, and stress.”
Some at the launch party viewed the magazine as not just a guide to food, but also a form of art for those who would rather eat their Chateaubriand than read about it. “Food is like artistic expression if you can find the right people to make it,” said executive editor Christopher Chang ’09. Chang added that he hopes to have Umami publish stories about culinary artists, such as one chef who crafted an exquisite kangaroo dish for him despite New York City’s endangered species regulations. “Some people say that kangaroo can be a bit gamey. But it was a very good cut,” recalled Chang.
And of course, such an event would have been incomplete without caviar. Umami Magazine’s favorite kind?  Russian Sturgeon.

Matthew B. Kaiser, assistant professor of English, is known for his sky-high CUE ratings, impeccable style and profound lectures. This semester, Kaiser’s English 156: “Crime and Horror in Victorian Literature and Culture,” drew in an impressive 454 students, according to the Registrar’s current course enrollment numbers. Don’t worry, though, the Add/Drop deadline isn’t for a few weeks yet.1. Fifteen Minutes (FM): The courses you teach at Harvard (English 90ow. “Oscar Wilde: Arts, Martyr, Celebrity”; English 154: “Literature and Sexuality”; English 156: “Crime and Horror in Victorian Literature and Culture) all address issues of sex and sexuality in Western culture. What led you to investigate these concepts in your academic work? Matthew B. Kaiser (MBK): To be fair, these courses are not about sex per se. They are about sexuality, which is the intellectual and political act of experiencing one’s identity through the logic of sex. What I try to do in my courses is to try to avoid idealizing sex and fearing sex. 2. FM: What does your mother think? MBK: If she were a student I think she’d be the first person to study these courses. In fact, students invite their parents to my lectures all the time. I think it’s my job to give people the intellectual tools to speak comfortably about uncomfortable things. When I see parents in the audience, I see that their kids are feeling comfortable. That makes me feel like I’ve done something well. 3. FM: Why do you think sex and sexuality were taboo topics in Western culture?MBK: Essentially, it has to do with the fact that sex has become the core of the self and making people self conscious about the core of themselves is a means of control. There was a time in history where the soul was the core of the self, and taboos around religious issues were just as touchy as issues of sex are for us. 4. FM: Do you still think these topics are taboo in America? In American universities? MBK: No, not really. However, I would say that at most American universities, there are a lot more courses on sex, gender and sexuality than there are at Harvard. Harvard is surprising in offering so few courses on this topic. 5.FM: Your interests lie in the area of nineteenth-century British literature and culture. Be honest—were we dirtier then or now? MBK: We would be shocked by each other. From a Victorian middle class perspective, twenty-first century women look like mannish prostitutes and men would appear vulgar and wimpy. On the other hand, we would be pretty shocked and disturbed by the amount of sexual violence and coercion that was a fact in the nineteenth century. We’d feel like prudes in each other’s company. 6. FM: Which is steamier: Penthouse or Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s “Venus in Furs?”MBK: Penthouse. It’s not steamy to me...but “Venus in Furs” is not a steamy novel at all. Von Sacher-Masoch has a particular brand of eroticism that is particularly cold and disembodied. His eroticism is more like an ice cube than steam. 7. FM: Complete this sentence: Sex at Harvard...MK: (Laughs) That’s one sentence that is left incomplete. 8. FM: Word on the street is that you are a pretty snappy dresser. Say you’re having a one-on-one meeting with President Drew G. Faust. What would you wear?MK: I would wear a dark blue suit, a vibrant tie and French cuffs. 9. FM: And what would you say?MK: I wouldn’t say anything, because what she’s experiencing right now is more profound and compelling than what I’m experiencing. I would sit and listen to what she had to tell me, and then I’d ask for a raise. 10. FM: Now say you’re having a one-on-one meeting with Oscar Wilde. You know, theoretically. Would you be wearing the same ensemble?MK: I would probably wear a slightly tighter version. 11. FM: And what would you say? MK: Again, Oscar Wilde was such an amazing speaker. I think I would just listen to him. I wouldn’t ask him for a raise, though. 12. FM: This year, you’re teaching “Crime and Horror” in Sanders Theater. How does it feel to be lecturing in that hallowed academic space to 454 students? MK: Exciting and inspiring. The room is beautiful and makes what you’re saying feel weighty. The one drawback to Sanders is that it’s very formal and some of the students are very far away, and I can’t see their faces, so that’s a little odd. 13. FM: Your CUE ratings have describe you as “funny,” “knowledgeable,” “excellent,” and “enthusiastic.” What words would you use to describe your students? MK: Brave, interesting and very smart. 14. FM: In your article, “A History of Ludicrous”, you explore the history of the word “ludicrous.” Say something ludicrous. MK: Unfortunately, my taste for the ludicrous has been destroyed by my academic study of it. 15. FM: Do you think this interview is ludicrous? We hope not. MK: (Laughs) Well it’s definitely ludicrous in the original sense of the word, which means playful. I will have to wait to see when it comes out in print to see if it’s ludicrous in the current sense of the word.

Since George Washington first took the presidential oath—153 years after Harvard’s inception—a total of seven Harvard graduates have captured the country’s top spot. On January 20, 2009, Harvard Law School graduate Barack H. Obama became the eighth. And while it may be unfounded and self-gratifying to view Obama solely as the product of his years in Cambridge, Harvard does have a record of success as an executive incubator. It is difficult to tell, however, to what degree the Harvard diploma opens the door to the nation’s highest office.THE ADAMS INTELLECTUALSHarvard’s history in the West Wing began with John Adams, the second president of the U.S. Though Adams, class of 1755, was one of the most studious future presidents during his time at the College, he graduated 14th out of a class of 24. At the time, class rankings were based on one’s dignity of birth and hierarchy of parentage rather than merit. In his autobiography, Adams wrote about his intellectual growth at Harvard, which came at the expense of more leisurely and amorous pursuits: “I perceived a growing Curiosity, a Love of Books and a fondness for Study, which dissipated all my inclination for Sports, and even the Society of the Ladies.”Following closely in his father’s footsteps, John Quincy Adams, class of 1788, was similarly academically occupied during his time in Cambridge. In 1787 he was charged with the unhappy task of defending the practice of Law at Harvard’s Spring Exhibition, according to the Harvard Guide. Rutherford B. Hayes—yes, he was a president—was also a devotee to legal studies, though he was a bit wild during his time at Harvard Law School, attending temperance meetings and binging on theater performances. Realizing upon his graduation in 1845 that enough was enough, he wrote in his diary, “The rudeness of a student must be laid off, and the quiet manly deportment of a gentleman put on, not merely to be worn as a garment but to become by use a part of myself.”THE SOCIALLY-CONSCIOUS AND THE SOCIALITEWhen Theodore Roosevelt arrived at Harvard, it was beginning to look like the school it is today—a place of legacy, tradition, old money and high class. Later in life, the irascible, excitable president would recall that he had been something of an eccentric during his collegiate days. Never able to master the drawn-out “Harvard drawl” or careless “Harvard swing” that would characterize upper-class cool at the time, he pursued boxing, rowing and bird-watching with fanaticism and kept a zoo with lobsters, snakes and a tortoise, according to the Harvard Guide. Though it would be decades until the department of Women, Gender and Sexuality would come into existence, Roosevelt had all the characteristics of a concentrator. His senior thesis eschewed the chauvinistic currents of his Harvard masters and mates—he wrote about gender equality, even proposing that women keep their own names in marriage.While Teddy may have never quite fit in, his nephew Franklin D. Roosevelt felt right at home at Harvard. FDR was the handsome and charming captain of the freshman football squad in addition to being a member of the Fly Club, the Hasty Pudding Club and the president of The Harvard Crimson. In class he consistently earned “gentleman’s C’s,” (read: a B today) focusing instead on his extravagant and exciting social life, according to the Harvard Guide.At his 25th class reunion in 1929, FDR, then a rising political star, announced a new age of social consciousness before an audience in Sanders Theater. “It is not so long ago that our own Harvard catalogues listed the young gentlemen’s those with ‘Esquire’ after their names, and those with the mere prefix ‘Mister’,” he said. “[Today] the Kansas farmer and the New York Mechanic send their sons and daughters to college.” FDR recognized that the Harvard of wealth and prestige, the Harvard at which Adams was judged by parentage and where the “Rough Rider” stuck out, was in the throes of change. “A TRAITOR TO FINE EDUCATION”But by FDR’s first run for the U.S. presidency in 1932 Harvard had not changed enough. A straw poll held by The Crimson revealed overwhelming student support for Herbert Hoover, FDR’s Republican opponent. The Crimson, his former paper, would later brand FDR “a traitor to his fine education.” Classmate Walter Russell Bowie, class of 1904, noted “the rancorous and almost hysterical political animus which rose against him and what he stood for among the privileged groups to which many of the Harvard graduates happened to belong.” Despite his cool reception on campus, FDR invited Harvard men to the White House throughout his presidency, once shaking the hands of two dozen Crimson oarsmen after a race in Annapolis, according to an article in Harvard Magazine. Among them was polio patient Tommy Hunter, whom Roosevelt, himself afflicted with the disease, rose to embrace. FDR’s brain trust, like Obama’s, had strong Harvard representation. Professor of Political Economy Alvin H. Hansen was one of the central architects of the New Deal. Harvard Business School Lecturer Adolph A. Berle Jr. ’13 and HLS Professor Felix Frankfurter served as close advisors, with Frankfurter later becoming one of FDR’s appointments to the Supreme Court. But FDR did wield the privilege of his birth at times. His first presidential nomination was orchestrated by fellow Harvardian and millionaire real estate speculator named Joseph P. Kennedy, class of 1912. Kennedy’s machinations behind the scenes won FDR the California delegation during the Democratic primary.THE CHARISMATIC CATHOLICWhile he never captured an elected office, Joe Kennedy bequeathed his political hopes to his sons, both of whom attended Harvard. John F. Kennedy ’40 arrived in Cambridge under the shadow of both his father and his brother, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. ’38, who was one of the most popular men on campus. In contrast, JFK was seen by his peers as a lesser version of Joe—classmates called him “attractive, witty, and unpurposeful.” He, like FDR, maintained “gentleman’s C’s” in his classes and wrote for The Crimson. He concentrated on his social life, playing junior varsity football and gaining entrance to the Spee Club and the Hasty Pudding Club. His swim coach at Harvard would call him “a fine kid, frail and not too strong, but always giving it everything he had,” perhaps foreshadowing John’s heroic rescue during World War II.During John’s sophomore year, his father was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain. John used his father’s connections to travel abroad in the summer of 1937, visiting fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. As a junior JFK made the Dean’s List and arranged for a grand tour of Europe that would count as a Harvard semester.In the spring of 1940, the beginning of his senior year, war was in the air. JFK’s honors thesis, entitled “Appeasement at Munich,” gathered the observations he had made during his travels into a well-formulated, far-seeing study of England’s actions leading up to war. The paper was published, with a little monetary help from a wealthy father and literary advice from a hired reporter, as “Why England Slept,” which became a modest bestseller. Henry Luce, the founder of Life magazine, described the difficulty of separating Kennedy the man from Kennedy the scholar in the book’s preface: “For it is Kennedy, after all, who launched the Peace Corps, challenged his country to land a man on the moon, and stirred countless young Americans with his optimistic talk of a New Frontier,” it read. “Destiny was in every fiber of young Jack Kennedy’s being.”THE MODERN PRESIDENTSAfter John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 it would be 38 years before the Crimson would retake the White House, during which time three Yalies called it home. Forty-third President George W. Bush attended Harvard Business School in the midst of the Watergate scandal, quite the unfortunate time to be the son of a prominent Republican in liberal-leaning Cambridge.Bush’s successor to the presidency thrived during his time at HLS, becoming the editor of the Harvard Law Review. But despite his stellar academic record, Obama has been much more reticent to fly his Harvard colors. “It seems very clear that Obama has not tried to identify himself with his collegiate background,” said Morton Keller, a professor emeritus of history at Brandeis University and author of the book “Making Harvard Modern.” Keller, who holds two Harvard degrees himself, said that for Obama, attending Harvard was probably not essential for his future success. “Insofar as Harvard represents him its his intelligence and in that sense Harvard could have been anyplace else,” he said.

You probably remember being on that Admissions Office tour way back when, lead by the effervescent tour guide who boasted, “...and to our right is Canaday, the newest dorm in Harvard Yard, completed in 1974. The architect, Ezra Ehrenkranz, built this dormitory in the shape of a question mark. And right ahead is our Science Center, which I’ve been told, looks like a Polaroid camera from an aerial view.” While these architectural tidbits certainly add some flair to the Yard, they are not the only Harvard buildings with an interesting history.Massachusetts Hall and Harvard HallBuilt in 1718, Massachusetts Hall is the oldest building still standing at Harvard and the second oldest academic building in the country. Like most of the Harvard buildings that existed during the Revolutionary War, the Continental Army used Mass. Hall to house soldiers. Apparently, soldiers and freshman share a penchant for slobbery. Legend has it that while housed in Mass. Hall, soldiers set back the University nearly 50 pounds in damages. Considering that the whole building cost 3,500 pounds to design and build, the soldiers must have had a pretty serious party.Today’s Harvard Hall is actually the third Harvard Hall to exist on campus. The original Harvard Hall, completed in 1644, was the first building that Harvard ever commissioned for construction. After thirty years, the building began to rot and was deemed uninhabitable, but the University waited until 1686 to demolish it. While the second Harvard Hall fared slightly better, it was destroyed by a fire in 1764, along with John Harvard’s library collection. That same year, the third and current Harvard Hall was designed by Francis Bernard, the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and students have been sleeping through lectures there ever since.Sever HallSever Hall, constructed in 1880, and designed by Henry Hobson Richardson, is a favorite of architectural critics. “Sever is considered by architects and historians to be one of the great American buildings,” said Eve Blau, Professor of Architectural History and Director of the Master of Architecture Degree Programs at the Graduate School of Design.Although his namesake is revered, John Warren Sever was not a model student. His student records show that his class attendance was so poor that he was forced to make up his classes privately, and was fined for “improper behavior” during services.Johnston Gate and the GuardhouseJohnston Gate was built in 1890 and is currently the oldest gate in Harvard Yard, designed by the New York firm McKim, Mead & White. The gate was the first Harvard structure built from what is now referred to as “Harvard brick,” used to ensure that the gate would resemble already extant eighteenth-century buildings in the Yard. The University requested that the gate, along with future buildings, only use a distinct type of hand-made and wood-burned red brick.The Guardhouse, also referred to as the “Gatelodge,” was constructed in 1983 and designed by Graham D. Gund. Gund graduated from Harvard’s Graduate School of Design with two degrees, in 1968 and 1969, respectively. His father, the late George Gund ’09, a graduate of the college and Harvard Business School, is the namesake of George Gund Hall, which now houses the Graduate School of Design. In designing the Guardhouse, Gund admitted that he went through roughly 80 blueprints in order to create a structure that satisfied both the purpose of regulating traffic in the Yard as well as the demands of the Cambridge Historical Commission. “The Gatehouse is a very sensitive spot between the oldest buildings, Massachusetts Hall and Harvard Hall,” said Gund at the time, “so there was a lot of concern about what the building would look like.”The building, approximately the size of a portable toilet, cost the University $57,000 to construct, with and additonal $10,000 that was spent on necessary restorations to the surrounding area.Before the construction of the guardhouse, the University had a security guard sit in a car at Johnston Gate throughout the day, but the measure proved insufficient. According to Gund, the Guardhouse was constructed to monitor and regulate the flow of traffic in and out of the Yard. “There was no control. The gate was just open.”Holden ChapelIt is easy for frequent visitors, and even residents, of the Old Yard to miss the the small chapel nestled behind Hollis Hall and Stoughton Hall. Holden Chapel, tucked between these two dorms and the Phillips Brooks House, was built in 1744. The chapel is the third oldest building in today’s Yard.  While Holden Chapel is no longer used for religious purposes, it is the rehearsal space for the Holden Choirs, which consist of the Harvard Glee Club, the Radcliffe Choral Society, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum. Despite the University’s ecclesiastical namesake, there was no chapel on campus for the first century of Harvard’s existence. The wife of Samuel Holden, a wealthy Englishman and avid supporter of Christian causes, donated 400 pounds to the University construction of the chapel after her husband’s death in 1740 for the.Despite its slated purpose, Holden Chapel was only used as a chapel for 22 years. In 1766, Harvard Hall became the new house of worship on campus. Holden Chapel has since functioned as a firehouse, laboratory, museum, auditorium, classroom, and even the Medical School, not to mention barracks for the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.Phillips Brooks HouseThe Phillips Brooks House, built in 1898, was designed by Alexander Wadsworth (A.W.) Longfellow, Jr., an 1876 graduate of the college and nephew of the famous poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. A.W. Longfellow also designed Cambridge’s City Hall.The house’s namesake, Phillips Brooks, was an 1885 graduate of the college. His great-grandfather was Samuel Phillips, Jr., the founder of Phillips Academy. Brooks, a member of the A.D. Club, became a minister, and while pastor at the Trinity Church in Boston’s Copley Square, penned the Christmas carol, “O Little Town of Bethlehem.”Before the construction of the Phillips Brooks House, undergraduates at Harvard were required to attend daily church services. The mandatory services generated backlash from students, and the University responded by designating the Phillips Brooks House a space for voluntary services as well as the newly-created department of Religion. The building was also used for charitable and social religious programs, which has carried over to its contemporary purpose, as the space for a secular umbrella community service organization.The Carpenter CenterEven the VES students who—often literally—call the Carpenter Center home might not realize the significance of the building itself. In fact, many students consider the building a campus eyesore. “I don’t think that it’s a building that people should necessarily like just from looking at it,” says Hyde. “I think that it’s a building that you actually have to experience and spend some time in it before you should be expected to make a decision about whether or not you like it.” The Carpenter Center is the only building designed by Swiss-French architect Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris, known as Le Corbusier, in North America. Rumor has it that Corbusier came to see the building when it was completed in 1963, only to accuse the contractor of building it upside down. Others insist that Corbusier never even saw the Carpenter Center in person.Widener, Lamont and Pusey LibrariesThe lore surrounding Widener is familiar to many: namely, the bibliophile Titanic victim whose mother donated a boatload—pun intended—of money to the school, premised on the condition that Harvard instituted a swim test as a requirement for graduation. This rumor is partly true. Harry Elkins Widener ’07, along with his father, died on the Titanic. His mother donated a large sum of money to the school in his name for a library, but stipulated that once Widener Library was built, its facade could not be altered. As a result, a walkway built between Widener and Houghton was made to go through one of Widener’s original windows. The odd crossing was eventually torn down for safety reasons.Lamont Library was built in 1946, in the name of Thomas W. Lamont, class of 1892 and then-chairman of the board of J.P. Morgan. The Dana-Palmer House had originally been built on the proposed Lamont lot. The University intended to demolish the house to make way for the new library, but due to alumni outcry and Mr. Lamont’s endless pockets, Harvard instead transplanted the Dana-Palmer House across the street, in its current spot by the Faculty Club. Lamont was the first library in America built solely for undergraduate study. While students might view Lamont as an academic prison, others disagree. “I think Lamont is one of the more elegant buildings in the Yard,” said Timothy Hyde, a professor at the Graduate School of Design. “It’s a very restrained building. I think it’s something that’s really balanced between being a background in the Yard and still attracting a little bit of attention.”Pusey library is named after Nathan M. Pusey, the 24th President of the University and a graduate of the class of 1920. Students may giggle when we say its name out loud, and any who visit know it is underground, but Pusey’s secret is that it is an architectural feat. Upon completion in 1970, Pusey was one of America’s few underground libraries. In order to build the library underground, anchored in the surrounding bedrock, the building had to be attached to the bedrock with a series of steel beams. Without these beams, the library would literally rise up from its underground location.The Barker CenterCompleted in 1997, the Barker Center exists on the lot of land that formerly held several notable buildings: the Student Union, Burr Hall, and Warren House. Until the 1990s, freshman ate in the Student Union. When the University decided to combine the three buildings to form the Barker Center, they first refurbished Memorial Hall in order to transform it into the freshman dining hall that it is today. The Barker Center, designed by the Boston firm Goody, Clancy & Associates, cost upwards of 25 million dollars to complete.The Holyoke Center The Holyoke Center was originally intended to bridge the gap between the Yard and the river houses. Completed in 1966 at a total cost of $412 million, the center was built in two phases, replacing four smaller buildings, one of which—the Hygiene Building—was originally built for the Spee Club. “Holyoke extends the campus beyond the campus,” says Blau. “It’s beyond the Yard. It’s the instrument that ties those pieces together.” While it is clear that many of Harvard’s buildings can be considered architectural triumphs, Gund believed that the space of the Yard itself is by far the University’s defining feature. “It is really quite remarkable how the fronts of buildings form the space, and the way the proportions of all the buildings, particularly the earlier ones, form the space where there’s an enclosed nature,” said Gund. “But it lets nature through the buildings, between them. I think it’s a very serene kind of quality and beautifully done.”Memorial HallMemorial Hall, completed in 1878, was meant to serve as a memorial to Harvard alumni who had died on the Union side of the Civil War. Mem Hall, as it is often called, was designed by Henry Van Brunt, class of 1854, and William Robert Ware, class of 1852. The two architects were chosen to design the building after winning an architectural contest sponsored by the University. The Building, which resembles a basilican church, was designed in the shape of a cross.For more information, check out:“Harvard: An Architectural History”;“The Crimson Key Society Guidebook to Harvard University”;“Sketch of the History of Harvard College”;“Three Centuries of Harvard (1636-1936)”.

Those childhood delicacies that perk you up with one look at their frosting mound and colorful details. I don’t remember the first time I ate a cupcake as a child (but I can remember how I always ate them—cake bottom first to save the three-inch frosting top for last). And I can’t claim a favorite flavor. But, as a second-semester senior, I proudly declare that my life revolves around cupcakes.My obsession with cupcakes has been growing over time, slowly creeping up on me almost unconsciously. I have always been a muffin snob, eating only the banana chocolate chip muffins from the bakery near my house and engaging in a “muffin exchange” with high school and college friends to search for the moistest muffin. But a stronger and deeper love for cupcakes that trumped any affection for muffins? That was less readily apparent.The acknowledgement of my addiction came slowly: noticing friends poking fun at me for choosing Finale’s chocolate cupcake with cream cheese frosting rather than Felipe’s burritos as a late-night snack; giving cupcakes as pick-me-ups to friends the night before their finals; and realizing I had integrated a discussion of cupcakes into otherwise unrelated conversations. Witnessing withdrawal symptoms when forced to replace cupcakes with French pastries during my junior fall abroad in France.And then, I embraced the obsession.As one of the countless Harvard undergraduates living in New York last summer, I leapt at the chance to leave my Midwestern roots and live in the country’s most populous city. But beyond the world-famous museums, endless crowds, and innumerable clubs, Manhattan became my cupcake haven. When friends came to visit, I unknowingly turned our tour of the city into a cupcake walking tour. Interested in eating brunch near the Upper West Side? I would transform this into a tasting tour of the petite cupcakes of Magnolia Bakery at Columbus and 69th, the overpowering cupcakes of Crumbs at Amsterdam and 75th, the cream-filled cupcakes of Alice’s Tea Cup at Columbus and 73rd, and the pastel-colored cupcakes of Buttercup Bake Shop at Columbus and 72nd (the tour could have continued, but our stomachs always seemed to be full and wallets empty after these almost-$4-each extravagances). When the Crumbs Bake Shop on Wall Street near my apartment would close by 8 p.m., my friends and I would instead venture to the Dessert Truck that parked itself along the same street until 2 a.m. each evening that summer. I also found solace in recognizing that I was not alone in my obsession. Carrie Bradshaw and “Sex and the City” brought high-society glamour to cupcakes when the show featured them in 2000.  Back in 2003, The New York Times wrote articles touting the “swelling trend in cupcakes.” And even my hometown of Chicago repeatedly boasts “cupcake crawls” of the city. But negative attention has also come to these confections. Cupcakes have even become a symbol for controversy over the past few years, embodying the “the cupcake problem” of too much sugar served in middle schools, according to one professor of nutrition at New York University. While many summer Dessert Truck quests ended in failure and countless cupcake tastings resulted in comments about the cupcake being “uninspired,” I always cherished the search. The perfect cupcake is not simply a taste, but also an act. You may sometimes come upon the cupcake with the perfect ratio of frosting to cake bottom, while many other times you are left with the untouched sand-tasting cupcake from the Kosher birthday party. And once in a while, you are left wondering how a brown sugar cupcake with bacon bits could ever taste good. Here’s to hoping the economy will leave the cupcake business untouched and at its sugary best. If it doesn’t, we can always indulge in the basic chocolate Hostess Cup Cake, extravagant frosting not included.

With departments seeking to “cut the fat” from their budgets to the tune of a 15 percent reduction requested by the FAS administration, bagels and bacon will be the first to go. Rather than eliminating central costs such as employees and course materials, department chairs are looking to cut down on non-essential expenses such as food and office supplies as they set the next year’s budget.
In the past, departments have offered food at faculty gatherings—coffee and pastries at breakfast meetings and catered sandwiches at lunch. With the entire university charged with the task of tightening its belt by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, nearly every department has had to scale back.
According to History of Science Department Chair Anne Harrington, even though the department’s food cost is only a small portion of the overall budget, the move is “partly symbolic politics.”
“It’s about changing the culture of expectation,” said Harrington, “so that you get used to buying your own piece of pizza on your way up [to a meeting] instead of expecting a sandwich and drinks when you get there.” 
Two weeks ago, the history department had its first faculty lunch-time meeting without providing lunch, said Professor of American Studies and Department Chair Lizabeth Cohen. “Much at Harvard had been lubricated with food and drink,” she said.
Faculty members were advised in an e-mail to bring their own lunch, “but some people didn’t read to the bottom of the e-mail,” she said. Those who did not pack a lunch found themselves sharing a banana with their colleagues, Cohen said.
Even with cuts to their food budgets, departments have not entirely abandoned snack-food. Departments are turning away from Crimson Catering to more cost efficient options like Costco.
Crimson Catering, the subdivision of Harvard University Dining Services that caters to events ranging from faculty meetings to gala dinners, declined to comment on any changes in sales. But they have begun advertising a special “Give Your Budget A Break” menu on their Web site, in an apparent recognition of the budgetary constraints sweeping the campus.
Harrington said that next year, the annual History of Science Christmas dinner will be transformed from an expensively catered event to a pot-luck, saving the department roughly $5,000.
Anthropology Department Chair Theodore C. Bestor said that in recent years, while the department has provided coffee to its faculty and staff, drinkers were expected to leave 25 cents for each cup consumed. But Bestor said that the $2,000 the department spent on coffee brought in only $400 worth of quarters. The department will not continue to offer coffee this year.
But, Harrington said, food is not everything. “It doesn’t cost anything to have a really engaging conversation.”

The dead body found Monday under Eliot Bridge on the Allston side of the Charles River has been identified as a missing 31-year-old Waltham man, according to Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley. The name of the individual has not yet been released.Initial attempts to ascertain the body’s age, race, and gender proved fruitless because of its advanced state of decomposition, according to Wark, but the body was ultimately identified through dental records. An autopsy was performed yesterday to gain more information, including the cause of death. The district attorney’s office suspects no foul play at this time, as the individual had a history of mental illness.“The deceased had tried to commit suicide in a similar manner before,” Wark said.In the aftermath of the discovery, police sent out a teletype to other police departments in the area, and the  Waltham Police Department responded that they were still searching for a man who had been reported missing several months ago.Wark sad that the body had likely been in the water for the entire time that he had been missing. “Sadly, it is not uncommon for a  body that may have been in the water through the winter to suddenly come to the surface in the spring after warmer temperatures,” he said, “It appears that may have been the case with this individual.”At approximately 1 p.m. Monday, a jogger observed what he believed to be a dead body near Eliot Bridge, which connects Cambridge to Allston. The jogger reported the discovery to Massachusetts State troopers in the Brighton Barracks, who later confirmed the finding. Because the body was found near Allston, the case falls under the jurisdiction of the Suffolk County DA’s office, according to Wark. —Staff writer Emily J.

Female athletes must raise awareness of their games and sports to combat chronically low attendance and encourage others to take up athletics, panelists said at a discussion of collegiate women’s sports last night.Participants called limited participation and turnout for women’s sporting events troubling, and said that athletes and Harvard College must better promote their games.“We have an obligation to support women, and we don’t do a great job at that,” said Kathy Delany-Smith, head coach of the women’s basketball team and moderator of the panel.Panelists and audience members discussed using the internet to publicize events and dedicating shuttles to take students to and from games.“We want women to feel a responsibility to go to a game, even if it’s cold out and they don’t want to cross the bridge,” Delany-Smith said. “Just go to the game, paint your face, and cheer them on.”Speakers said the lackluster attendance reflected broader issues discouraging participation in women’s sports, which they said suffer from a false comparison to male athletics, leading to lack of female athlete role models.Panelist Wendy Healy, general manager of recreation at Harvard, said female participation in athletics is also affected because some women are self-conscious about going to gyms or exercising. The group urged women to fight such a “stigma” and get active.“Recreation should be part of every woman’s life,” said Delany-Smith.Panelist Liz O’Leary, head coach of the women’s heavyweight crew team, encouraged women to join teams, saying lessons learned from playing a sport transcend many aspects of a woman’s life.“You learn how networking and camaraderie help you beyond your sport,” she said.“I learned as much, if not more, through basketball as through academic programs,” said panelist and former basketball player Jessica C. Gelman ’97, who now works for the New England Patriots. “Supporting a team in college is much like supporting a department now.”Participants said events like last night’s panel, hosted by Harvard Athletics and Harvard College Women’s Center, are important to combat problems facing women’s athletics. But basketball player Emma C. Moretzsohn ’09 said far more needed to be done to promote sports like hers.“Panels like this help, but we have to get word out,” said Moretzsohn. “We need to tell people to come to games, tell our friends.”

For students longing for five-dollar footlongs, Subway is opening in the Garage on JFK St. today after three weeks of delays. 
The original launch date was slated for Jan. 29 in the space that was once filled by Boston Chowda, nestled between Ben & Jerry’s and Lê’s Vietnamese Restaurant.
Sanjay Kansagra, the franchisee of the Harvard Square location, said the new Subway experienced minor construction delays such as the late installation of a Coke machine and labor delays in late January due to Martin Luther King Day. 
Construction originally began at the Garage a week after Thanksgiving—since then, the storefront has been boarded up with a “coming soon” sign above it. 
Kansagra had been in talks with Trinity Property Management, which owns and leases the space, for the past four years.
There are already Subway franchises open at 1105 Mass Ave. and 260 Western Ave. in Allston, along with locations in Somerville and Central Square, but Kansagra said he decided to open a branch in the Garage since there were not yet any locations directly in the Square. 
Kansagra said he chose this specific space because it offers a mix of tenants and a strong customer base—thousands of college students.
The Garage location of Boston Chowda “was never really a real good performer,” said Stephen D. Post, controller of Boston Chowda in an interview with the Crimson in December.
Post attributed the outlet’s poor performance to competitors’ cheaper prices for larger portions.
The location is bracing for opening day with plenty of staff, said Kansagra, who added that they are “pretty much trained.” Opening hours today will be from 10 a.m. until midnight.
Undergraduates said that they were excited about the new Subway location. 
“If I remember that it’s there and they advertise well, I’ll go,” said Jessica L. Flakne ’11.
For others, the new Subway presents a wholesome new choice for a meal.
“It’s a healthy alternative,” said Gabrielle K. Gould ’11, who added that she enjoyed Subway sandwiches and appreciated the variety of options typically offered.

General David H. Petraeus, chief of U.S. military operations in much of the Eastern Hemisphere, including the Middle East, will speak at this spring’s Reserve Officer Training Corps commissioning ceremonies at both Harvard and MIT, a top ROTC official confirmed earlier today.  
Petraeus, whose son Stephen will be commissioned at the MIT ceremony, has developed a “personal relationship” with a number of cadets from both schools while attending various ROTC events, according to MIT ROTC Commanding Officer Lt. Colonel Timothy J. Hall.
Cadets from Harvard, MIT, and other Boston-area schools train together on the MIT campus.    
The Harvard commissioning ceremony, set for June 3, has generally not drawn significant interest in years past. At the 2008 event, roughly 100 spectators gathered in Tercentenary Theater to see University President Drew G. Faust headline the list of speakers.
This year, Hall said, a group of Harvard cadets decided they wanted to invite Petraeus to speak at the commissioning ceremony, and Petraeus—who spoke at the Kennedy School in 2002—accepted the group’s offer.
Petraeus, who is head of U.S. Central Command and was named a runner-up for Time Magazine’s 2007 Person of the Year, oversaw multinational forces in Iraq from February 2007 until September of last year, and is often credited with effectively overseeing the implementation of the U.S. “surge” strategy in the Middle East. 
“I think he’s excited to make it a special day for all the Harvard guys and girls,” said Stephen H. Petraeus, who added that he had not spoken to his father about what he plans to say in his speech. 
“We’re very excited to have [Petraeus] coming because it means so much to our students,” Hall said. “As the commander of U.S. Central Command, he oversees areas that will be relevance to them as they move out into the Army.”
Harvard’s strained relationship with ROTC peaked when the program was banned from campus in 1969 amid student protests over the Vietnam War. 
In recent years, Harvard and other elite universities have barred military recruiters from their campuses due to the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which prohibits openly gay individuals from serving in the military.

Harvard Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz has called for a “counter-disinvestment campaign” against Hampshire College unless the school explicitly denies claims that their recent decision to withdraw from a mutual fund represents an act of divestment from Israel.Hampshire administrators decided earlier this month to withdraw investments from a State Street mutual fund with holdings in six companies contracting with the Israeli military, after a college student group, Students for Justice in Palestine, petitioned the school to divest because of the companies’ ties to what students called “Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestine.”Hampshire President Ralph M. Hexter ’74 said yesterday that the move resulted from a broader review of the fund that was prompted by the student petition and found that many of its companies—not just those flagged by the students—did not meet the college’s ethical standards.“Israel’s occupation played no role in this decision,” Hexter said. “I want to make it very clear that we have funds in other Israeli companies, and we’re continuing to hold onto those stocks.”After the student group hailed Hampshire’s decision as a divestment victory, Dershowitz entered the fray, demanding to know from the group’s leaders and Hampshire administrators whether the decision was an act of divestment.“My goal is to fight back and to end this hijacking of the human-rights agenda,” Dershowitz said. “This was a cancer that had to be stopped.”Dershowitz said he called the student group’s spokesperson to confirm that Hampshire had divested from Israel, and that he did not want to launch a campaign to stop donations to the college unless the college had divested.The divestment debate carries particular weight at the Amherst, Mass. college, as it was the first U.S. college to divest from South Africa in 1977.Leaders of the student group have accused Dershowitz—whose son attended Hampshire—of threatening them and the college in an act of “academic bullying.”“Dershowitz called me a few minutes after the press release came out,” said Matan Cohen, a student spokesperson for the group and a sophomore at Hampshire. “He threatened to start a boycott campaign against me, SJP, and the college at large.”Dershowitz acknowledged calling the student group and administrators but denied allegations that he threatened anyone.“Anyone who interpreted it as a threat is simply lying for ideological reasons,” Dershowitz said.Facing the possibility of a boycott, administrators at the college issued a “statement of clarification” that said the decision to withdraw from the fund was made “without reference to any country or political movement,” in an effort to distance itself from the claim that the college had divested from Israel.But the administration’s response did not unequivocally deny divestment in Israel and allowed SJP to claim that the action had been taken to protest Israel’s actions, Dershowitz said.Dershowitz added that he does not oppose protesting Israel’s actions but said the college’s actions smacked of hypocrisy and anti-Semitism in light of other human-rights abusers around the world.Hampshire had not withdrawn its money from the State Street fund as of yesterday, according to a spokeswoman for the school. The college has $4 million invested in the fund, which represented about 20 percent of the school’s managed funds at the end of 2008.As of yesterday, Dershowitz and the college remained at loggerheads, with the Harvard professor vowing to continue his campaign until Hampshire publicly clarified its decision.“The president of Hampshire said personally to me that ‘we didn’t divest from Israel.’ If he’s prepared to say that publicly, then the issue is over,” Dershowitz said.—Staff writer Elias J.

With the markets in slump, more Cantabrigians are finding cheap solace in the arms of others—others’ clothing, that is.
In the depths of the recession, secondhand retailers have noted sharp upticks in phone calls from people interested in selling their old duds for a split of the profits. Others have noticed more new faces browsing the racks. And the regulars who already buy secondhand are now trawling the racks more frequently.
Kathleen M. White, the owner of Oona’s on Mass. Ave., sells vintage men’s and women’s clothing and jewelry. In recent months, White has noticed a dramatic increase in people interested in selling their clothing to her.
“I get 10 a calls a day to go to people’s houses,” she said. “Before, you would get 10 a year.”
THE CLOTHES OFF THEIR BACKS
Second Time Around, a resale shop specializing in designer clothing, has more than tripled the number of branches in the last four years. 
“There were five stores when I started,” said Alyson M. Booth, the manager of the Harvard Square location. “There’s 16 now.”

University President Drew G. Faust announced Wednesday afternoon that Harvard will slow construction on the Allston Science Complex for the rest of 2009, as the University reassesses its financial situation after an unprecedented decline in its endowment.The news follows months of warnings that the economic downturn could delay Harvard’s ambitious plans for a new campus across the river. Harvard has heralded the Science Complex as a core part of its plans.According to Faust’s statement, the Science Complex’s foundation will be completed and brought to ground level at a slower pace while planners conduct detailed cost analyses to determine whether to keep current plans, reconfigure the building to cut costs, or halt construction completely.Faust said the rest of Harvard’s Allston planning—which has been slated to occur over a 50-year time span—will also slow. She added that Harvard will “develop options for interim improvements to [its] existing properties” as well as deliver on its previously agreed-upon community benefits.Harvard programs promised space in the complex, such as the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and the much-heralded Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, would instead move into renovated spaces in Cambridge, according to the statement.—Staff writer Peter F.

James L. Frazier, an assistant strength coach for University of Iowa football, will become the director of Harvard’s strength and conditioning program, Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise announced yesterday.Frazier, a 2006 graduate of Brown University, will fill a month-long vacancy created by the departure of former head strength coach Craig Fitzgerald for the University of South Carolina. The former Brown defensive end and linebacker will begin overseeing all 41 Crimson varsity programs on March 2. Frazier’s hiring comes at an opportune time for the Crimson. Fitzgerald’s January departure was followed closely by assistant strength director Daniel Perlmutter’s decision to take a position at Duke, leaving assistant director Timothy Mullen, coaching assistant Shauna Forsyth, and two full-time interns with the daunting task of providing equal attention to every squad without an administrative head.“I’m definitely looking forward to [working at Harvard],” Frazier said. “As somebody that graduated from an Ivy League school, I know what [the athletes] are going through mentally and physically...I’m coming into a blessed situation by joining a pretty experienced staff.”Frazier has shown versatility to this point in his career, interning with the NBA’s Chicago Bulls prior to his two years with Iowa’s football staff. In a short stint training the Hawkeyes, the two-time All-Ivy selection left a notable impression.“[Frazier] is very progressive and very intelligent,” fellow Iowa football strength and conditioning coach Chris Doyle said. “I think he takes a comprehensive approach to training the athlete...[He] is a great get for Harvard.”Frazier was a highly recruited high school athlete when he decided to attend Brown, said Bears’ defensive coordinator Michael Kelleher, who coached Frazier throughout much of his collegiate career.Frazier was captain of the team and a four-year letterman, leading Brown to an Ivy League title in 2005. In college, he showed the makings of someone who would make his living from athletics, Kelleher said.“I always thought he would be a great coach,” Kelleher said. “He loved all the behind-the-scenes aspects of football.”Frazier—who earned his degree from Brown three years ago—refused to state his age in an interview with The Crimson.“As far as the age and that kind of stuff, it is neither here nor there,” he said. “It’s about what you bring to the table—the knowledge and background you have.”Kelleher supported his former player’s leadership ability, citing his maturity despite his youth.The newly hired coach’s tender age will create an interesting dynamic in the weight room next year. Current Harvard football captain Carl D. Ehrlich ’09-’10 and a few other players were on Harvard’s team at the same time Frazier was playing for Brown, Ehrlich said.But Ehrlich added that he thought his new coach’s age would be a boon.“I think it will be good to have a young strength coach who is hungry to learn,” he said.“We are pleased to welcome James to our community,” said Scalise in a Harvard Athletic Communications announcement. “Our strength and conditioning staff is known for its high energy and James is no exception.”Although he is only a few years removed from competing on Saturdays, Frazier’s allegiances have changed now, he said.“When it’s all said and done, I’m with Harvard,” Frazier said. “I’m for Harvard. I want to train them to beat Brown the best way I can,” His old coach Kelleher saw it the same way.“He is the enemy now,” he said.—Staff writer Max N.

In the latest chapter of one of the East’s biggest rivalries, the Harvard women’s hockey team once again came up short. After rallying back from a 2-0 deficit, the No. 9 Crimson (15-9-3, 14-4-2 ECAC) fell to No. 5 New Hampshire (20-5-5, 13-2-4-1 Hockey East), 3-2, in overtime last night at Bright Hockey Center. Despite outplaying the Wildcats through the last 25 minutes of play, Harvard gave UNH an opening when sophomore Liza Ryabkina drew a holding penalty with 1:21 left in extra time.The Wildcats seized the opportunity. UNH senior Sam Faber won a faceoff in the Crimson end, and fed the puck to junior Jenn Wakefield.With 39 seconds left, Wildcat sophomore Courtney Birchard received the puck in the right circle, and wristed it through a screen and into the back of the net to end the game.“Obviously, [we were] very disappointed in the outcome, because the game turned on a dime because of a penalty,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. To even bring the game to overtime, however, the Crimson had to claw its way back from a sluggish start.Both teams traded missed opportunities in the game’s opening minutes, and while Harvard got a power-play chance with six minutes left in the first, the team failed to convert, a problem that would follow it for the rest of the evening.“I don’t think we really got it going,” Stone said of the power play. “We draw people to us, and that’s when you need to attack a give-and-go and get a 2-on-1 situation. We really didn’t do that, we kept our heads down and shot the puck.” New Hampshire got on the board at 17:28 in the first on a slow-motion 2-on-1 breakaway. After taking a pass from Courtney Sheary, Wildcat Shannon Sisk sped up the left side of the ice. Though Crimson senior Nora Sluzas got between the two UNH skaters, Sisk found a charging Julie Allen, who powered the puck past Harvard junior goaltender Christina Kessler. Three minutes into the second period, another odd-man rush led to another UNH goal. In the midst of a sloppy Harvard power play, Wildcat junior Kelly Paton intercepted the puck in the neutral zone and broke up the ice. She beat her Crimson defender and fed the puck to Wakefield, UNH’s top scorer, who was waiting on the right post to put in the shorthanded tally. All the momentum seemed to be in the Wildcats’ favor, with netminder Lindsey Minton stopping a number of Harvard shots. But at 9:21, tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt took matters into her own hands.Vaillancourt took a pass from Sluzas and drove to the net from the right circle. After outmaneuvering the UNH defense, she slipped the puck past Minton to cut the deficit in half. “She tries to do a lot and she does a lot,” Stone said of the tri-captain. “That kid never quits. You can’t leave her alone for a second, because she’s going to do something.”Harvard put itself back in a hole less than a minute later, when sophomore Kate Buesser and junior Cori Bassett were whistled for back-to-back penalties. The Crimson trio of Vaillancourt, tri-captain Jenny Brine, and classmate Kati Vaughn were faced with 1:17 of 5-on-3 play, and the seniors responded admirably.“That was obviously a crucial moment in the game,” tri-captain Kirsten Kester said. “They called that timeout, so we knew they were probably going to try to pull something tricky on us.”Kessler made three saves on that penalty kill, and Harvard caught a lucky break when a Wildcat goal was called back because the net had come out of position.The Crimson fed off the confidence gathered from the kill, and at 15:34 in the second, Harvard junior Kathryn Farni netted the equalizer.Farni took advantage of a botched clearing attempt, and her long, unassisted slapshot from the blue line sailed through traffic and past Minton to even the score, 2-2.“Two months ago, down 2-0, I think we probably would have folded,” Stone said. “But these kids believe in each other, and they’re capable of coming back. I give them a lot of credit, because it wasn’t easy, and UNH is a very good team.”The Crimson carried its momentum into the third period, outshooting the Wildcats 17-9, but couldn’t find the back of the net. “It’s frustrating, but it’s a tribute to their goaltender,” Kester said. “We surpassed them in the shot count in the third period, which was one of our goals, so we’re pretty happy with that. Again, just kind of tough luck.”Harvard got a crucial opportunity late in regulation, when UNH captain Kacey Bellamy was called for checking at 16:32. But once again, the Crimson failed to capitalize on the man advantage, despite launching four shots at Minton. Minton made 33 saves on the evening, while Kessler finished with 28.Harvard had its fair share of chances in extra time as well, but Minton came through with saves on good shots from Vaillancourt and junior Anna McDonald.The team’s biggest chance came just over two minutes into overtime, when a flurry of Crimson shots left Minton sprawled across the ice. Despite the wide-open net, Harvard couldn’t lift a shot into the goal. “To be honest, I thought they would have been lucky to get a tie from us, so [we’re] pretty disappointed with the way things turned out,” Kester said. “But that’s how it goes.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its 3-2 overtime loss to No. 5 New Hampshire last night, the No. 9 Harvard women’s hockey team lived and died by the penalty kill.
When all hope seemed lost for the Crimson, its performance while outnumbered provided the team with inspiration. 
But just when a Harvard victory appeared inevitable, an untimely penalty brought devastation.
“We put ourselves in a position to win a game and then we put ourselves out of a position to win a game,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said.
After Harvard cut the Wildcats’ 2-0 lead in half when tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt scored a goal 9:21 into the second period, the Crimson nullified any momentum it might have gained with two penalties within 40 seconds of each other.
Less than a minute after Vaillancourt scored, sophomore Kate Buesser was whistled for checking. 
With Harvard already a player down, junior Cori Bassett joined Buesser in the box after she sent an opponent sprawling on the ice to draw a roughing call.
Facing the daunting task of killing a 5-on-3 UNH power play, the Crimson rose to the occasion on the collective back of its veteran leaders. 
Vaillancourt, tri-captain Jenny Brine and senior defender Kati Vaughn repelled the Wildcats’ advances in Harvard’s defensive zone.
“[The three seniors] really adjusted well,” tri-captain Kirsten Kester said. “They worked well in the rotation. I do think that was a really crucial moment in the game, really could have swung the momentum either way but it kept us in there.”
Junior goaltender Christina Kessler also did her part in the effort, making several flashy saves throughout the course of UNH’s power play to turn away near-goals. Kessler finished the night with 28 saves.
With the Wildcats denied, Harvard roared back when it finally returned to even strength, tying the score on a goal by junior defenseman Kathryn Farni at 15:34 into the second frame.
But the penalty kill proved to be a double-edged sword for the Crimson.
While neither Harvard nor UNH managed to score in the third period, the Crimson controlled the pace of the game in the final stanza of regulation and continued its dominance of the puck in overtime. 
But Harvard’s offensive assault was rendered powerless 3:39 into the extra period when sophomore Liza Ryabkina committed a holding penalty in the Crimson’s offensive zone.
“You can’t play with one hand behind your back,” Stone said.
With Harvard in dire straits, the Wildcats smelled blood. 
On a bang-bang play following a faceoff, UNH’s Courtney Birchard slammed a pass from teammate Jenn Wakefield past Kessler to send the Crimson home empty-handed.
“Offensive zone penalties like that—those are things we can control,” Kester said. “Again, in that case, it wasn’t an issue with the refs. That was on our part, and…one thing we talked about after the game is taking control of those plays and really owning up to them.”
In a night in which Harvard turned its penalties into a rallying point for an impressive comeback, the Crimson’s final infraction was too much.
Yesterday night was just the latest episode in a seemingly endless saga of disappointment in Harvard’s meetings with UNH.
While the Crimson has enjoyed success against some of the fiercest competition in the nation in recent seasons, Harvard hasn’t taken a victory over the Wildcats in over five years.
Since a 4-0 Crimson win against UNH on Jan. 9, 2003, Harvard is 0-6-2 against its Hockey East opponent.
“They’ve got talent and goaltending,” Stone said. “They play with an edge. They’re a tough team to play against. But we like playing against them because it’s tough competition.”
Tough competition might have finally been bested last night, save for one penalty kill too many.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard may have won its third game of the season, but it was too close for comfort. 
The Crimson men’s volleyball team (3-4, 1-1 EIVA) beat crosstown opponent Newbury (16-2) in five sets last night at the Malkin Athletic Center. 
Coming off a disappointing two-loss weekend, the team took the first two games and dropped the next pair before wrapping up the match in a highly-contested fifth game. 
Just when it appeared that a win would be in easy reach for Harvard after the second set, Newbury started to prove otherwise. 
“Half the time we play great and half the time we don’t,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “I thought the first two games were two of the best of the season. We were hitting at a much higher percentage than we had been.”
Harvard won the first set in a close fashion, 30-28. 
The team made an early run before Newbury came back within striking distance. 
As Newbury junior Mark Thomas, who finished with a team-high 25 kills, slammed down kill after kill, Crimson co-captain Brady Weissbourd and freshman Matt Jones responded each time with kills of their own. 
With the game at 28-27, Weissbourd answered the call one last time, making two key kills to win the set. 
Harvard finished the first set with a solid team attack of .389 and a match-high 19 kills. 
The team continued its good play into the second game, dominating the Nighthawks, 30-23. 
The Crimson energized the crowd as it raced to a 27-20 lead before trading a couple of points thanks to errors on both sides. 
Harvard improved its team attack to .448, compared to Newbury’s dismal .121.
The third game would prove to be a different story. 
Newbury bounced back from the previous set to beat the Crimson, 30-24. 
The set was tied at 16 when Newbury went on a 4-0 run that changed the dynamic of the game. 
Harvard cut the lead to 25-22, but the Crimson could not recover and made a set error and attack error that would cost it the set. 
“For some reason that we haven’t figured out yet, whenever games three and four come around we sort of relapse and start making errors,” Baise said. “We lose a bit of focus.”
Newbury won in a similar manner in the fourth game, 30-25. 
Harvard had four service errors, including one that shifted the momentum of the set when the game was tied at 20. 
The Nighthawks hit their match high of .395, going strong and confident into the fifth set.
However, Harvard denied Newbury the comeback victory by hitting a match high of .529 in the final set. 
Weissbourd, who had a monster match with 34 kills, came up big, killing the ball eight times. 
The match ended on a service error by the Nighthawks, culminating a tense encounter with a team that’s been tested many times this season. 
“Newbury is a really experienced team,” junior co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “They’ve played way more games than we have, so when you approach a team like that, you know they’re here to play. But I think we showed a lot of heart, and when it mattered, we won.”
Weintraub had a huge game, finishing with a career-high 67 assists. 
It was in this match that he reached an important landmark in his collegiate career, surpassing 1000 assists. 
“It’s pretty sweet, 1000 is a big number, a nice big round number,” Weintraub said. “I’m glad to be there.”
The Crimson offense showed signs of improvement despite the absence of freshman Nikola Ivica, a crucial factor in Harvard’s early-season victories. 
Ivica was not present at last night’s game for unspecified reasons.
“Nikola Ivica is no longer on the team,” Baise said. “We’re down to nine players which make things real hard, but I like the guys we have.”
Even without Ivica in the lineup, Baise was proud to see how the team took last weekend’s losses and responded with a watershed victory.
“We talked about perspective, and both matches we didn’t play as well as we would’ve liked,” Baise said. “We knew that, and we learned some things. If we didn’t go and play those matches then maybe we couldn’t have pulled out this win tonight. It was hard, but I was proud of how they showed up tonight.”
