After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Black suffering has once again made national headlines for the world’s consumption.
This has unfortunately become the norm in the era of COVID-19 as Black communities have been ravaged by the coronavirus’ deadly impacts — an exacerbation of a previously existing pandemic: racism.
Racism once again has reared its ugly head with the tragic recent murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Tony McDade. In just three months, Black people across the nation have had to mourn the unjust taking of these Black lives, all whilst attempting to survive a virus hunting them down as if they had targets on their backs.
In response to these tragic happenings people have taken to social media to express how “shocked” they have been by recent news. But for Black people we know all too well this is just an extension of the systemic racism threaded into the fabric of America.
This past Saturday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow released a statement in response to the ongoing protests across the country. In it he harkens back to his experiences as a high school student during the civil unrest that followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and goes on to suggest a way forward by centering solutions in American ideals. While I appreciated his attempt to provide comfort during these challenging times, as a Black woman I know all too well that American ideals have rarely benefited Black people.
While I wish I could believe in the Constitution and the illustrious “American Dream,” my experiences as a Black woman are poignant reminders that such luxuries were and continue to be reserved for a select few. In 1787, the founders of our country came together and decided my body and those of my ancestors were only worth three-fifths of that of a white body. My ancestors then had to endure centuries of lynching, brutalization, and terror before their most basic access to the ideals of this country would be recognized with the 14th Amendment. Even with this formal gesture, Black people have continued to suffer disproportionately at the hands of systemic and interpersonal racism in this country. Therefore, when we see yet another Black body on national television, it hurts us, it angers us, it maddens us; but it does not surprise us. We know that since the inception of this country our existence has been deemed subordinate, and the current state of affairs is a reminder of that.
The evidence lies in the overrepresentation of Black people as “essential workers,” whose lives will be put at risk due to the current administration’s cursory move to reopen the country against the advice of public health experts. The proof also lies in the disproportionate infection and mortality rates of Black people due to COVID-19 and the disparate arrest rates of Black people in response to social distancing policies. COVID-19 didn’t create these disparities on its own. The virus has simply propagated itself along the lines of inequality America drew upon its creation.
Therefore, if the improvement of the Black condition in this country hinges on American values, we have already failed. Because we cannot expect a system that was never designed for us to protect us. Our discussion around race in higher education has mostly prioritized white comfort and has largely omitted the essential facts outlined above. Only time has changed.
Educators, leaders, and decision-makers must understand that lunch talks, diversity and inclusion committees, and Black and brown faces on pamphlets are all futile efforts if not coupled with anti-racist practices. It is time that unconscious bias trainings turn into honest conversations about systemic racism, police brutality, and power. It is time for organizations to look internally at their own power structures and answer tough questions like why qualified Black professionals aren’t advancing within their institutions. Equally important in this self-assessment is to address how institutions have been complicit in deepening the roots of systemic racism. This includes divestment from private prisons, abolishment of racialized medicine, and acknowledgment of higher education’s role in driving gentrification in the communities they inhabit.
As a current medical student and future healer, my version of the American dream includes medical and academic institutions reckoning with their role in harming my community. This goes beyond statements of solidarity and the creation of more committees. It consists of true allyship that can only be obtained through anti-racism.
This is the dream I hope to obtain — one where Ahmaud, Breonna, George, and Tony might have lived to see fifty years of age. The traditional sense of the American Dream is an exclusionary one. It’s time to forge a way forward and craft a new one, but first we must study and learn from the nightmare the first one became.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's Undergraduate Council unanimously voted on Monday evening to increase the donation amount they will match from Harvard College affiliates that give to racial justice groups to $10,000.
UC President James A. Mathew ’21 and Vice President Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 called the emergency session — the Council’s second in the past 72 hours — to discuss further action items in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was murdered by Minneapolis police on May 25.
On Saturday, the UC unanimously passed an initial bill that gave it the ability to match student donations to groups that fight for racial justice. Two hours after the meeting’s conclusion, Mathew and White-Thorpe sent out a campus-wide email announcing that they would match donations from Harvard undergraduates up to $5,000.
On Sunday evening, Mathew and White-Thorpe sent out a second email to Harvard affiliates announcing that contributions had surpassed their initial goal. The quick influx of donations prompted the Council to consider taking up legislation to raise the matching ceiling.
“In less than 24 hours, we have raised over $14,000!! Thank you to everyone who has contributed to making this fundraiser so successful,” Mathew and White-Thorpe wrote. “While the UC has already voted to match $5,000, given the significant influx of donations, we will be meeting tomorrow night at 7 PM EST to hopefully approve legislation that would double our match amount.”
During the meeting, some representatives expressed concern that the matching money would come from the $200 Student Activities Fee that undergraduates give to the Council. UC Treasurer Noah Harris ’22 said in response that the money given to charities would not be funded by the Student Activities Fee.
“We were basically clarifying that the money we're using to go to these charities through his GoFundMe, and matching these donations does not come from money that students pay from the Student Activities Fee,” Harris said. “And that's a really important thing we wanted to do because we want to make sure that every dollar we spend from the Student Activities Fee — and that students and the university and trust us — to spend is being spent on Harvard undergraduates and their student activities.”
Before Monday’s meeting, Mathew, White-Thorpe, and Harris met briefly to talk about how they could fund an expanded UC donation effort.
“Yeah, so this was something that we clarified at the very beginning of administering this fund with our treasurer,” Mathew said. “The money that we are matching donations with is part of our budget that is not from the Student Activities Fee.”
Despite the inquiries over funding, many UC members said they were excited about passing the bill. Mathew and White-Thorpe commented in a Monday interview on how pleased they were with the student body’s quick action in supporting their fundraiser.
“I am proud of the student body for putting their money where their mouth is for doing more than just posting on social media, and it's great to raise awareness, but it's even better for us to actually get involved and take action,” White-Thorpe said. “And that's exactly what this front is aimed at, and that is exactly what our student body has been doing by donating to these various funds, so I'm incredibly proud.”
As of Monday evening, the Council’s GoFundMe page had raised over $21,000 in donations. Quincy House Representative Matthew S. Miller ’21 wrote in an emailed statement that he was touched by how fast students came together.
“It’s been really breathtaking and inspiring to see that in just two days, Harvard students and their families have come together to raise over $21,000 from over 600 donors,” Miller wrote. “When we were initially planning the fundraiser, I don't think we had any idea that there would be such an incredible outpouring of support.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eight months after United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) announced he was running for the U.S. Senate, he and incumbent U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) still can’t find much to disagree about.
In their first debate in over three months, Kennedy called for new leadership, while Markey touted his record as a Washington veteran. But much like in their first debate, which took place before the coronavirus upended traditional campaigning, policy differences were few and far between Monday night.
Kennedy made the case that Massachusetts “can get an awful lot more” out of its representation in the Senate than Markey has delivered, though he declined to take the gloves off fully in the debate, which was hosted at Western Mass News’ studios in Springfield, Mass.
“This moment requires stronger presence, better judgement, and clearer vision than Senator Markey has delivered,” Kennedy said.
Markey, who has served in Washington since 1976, pointed to accomplishments on issues such as climate change, Alzheimer’s disease research, and net neutrality. Markey has served in the Senate since 2013.
“I have led and delivered for the people of Massachusetts since the beginning of my career and throughout this coronavirus pandemic,” he said.
A question from debate moderator Janet Wu put Markey on defense over his commitment to Western Massachusetts residents. Wu, a WCVB-TV political reporter, asked him to explain why “we don’t see you around Springfield that often.” Markey responded by pointing to a slate of endorsements he picked up from Western Massachusetts officials just prior to the debate.
“The reason they have endorsed me is that I come to Western Massachusetts,” he said. “I take care of the problems of the people of Massachusetts. I stand up and deliver for them.”
Kennedy pounced, saying that elected officials in the area told him they had rarely seen Markey in their part of the state. Markey — who owns a house in Chevy Chase, Md., in addition to his childhood home in Malden, Mass. — has long been dogged by criticisms that he spends too much of his time inside the Beltway.
“I don’t think this state can afford absent leadership in the moment that we are in,” Kennedy said.
“That is absolutely untrue,” Markey retorted, in the debate’s most heated exchange. “And if it was true, then all these mayors would not have endorsed me.”
Both candidates expressed solidarity for protestors in Boston and elsewhere following instances of anti-black police brutality that included the killing of George Floyd. Markey lambasted President Donald Trump, who, mere minutes before the debate began, called for increased law enforcement presence across the country and said he may deploy the U.S. military to city streets.
“People are furious, and they have every right to be,” Kennedy said in his opening remarks. “We want peace. But there will be no peace without justice. And the fact is that for, far too long, communities of color have been asked to share a burden of structures that they did not write.”
Markey said Trump “wants to make America hate again.”
“It’s not just our buildings that are on fire, it is the very soul of our country which is on fire right now,” Markey said. “And that fire will not go out until we confront the systemic racism that is built into our society."
The two candidates differed on their evaluations of how Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 has responded to the coronavirus crisis. Asked to give Baker’s response a letter grade, Markey punted, blaming Trump and saying only, “Charlie Baker is working very hard.”
Kennedy was more critical.
“At this point, incomplete. But when it comes to an issue like the Soldiers’ Home, an F,” he said. At the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, Mass., at least 76 veterans have died due to COVID-19.
Recent polling suggests the race is tightening after Kennedy initially held a large lead.
Michael Goldman — a longtime Democratic political consultant — said the debate didn’t expose any major flaws, but that the candidates “both appeared to be a little bit rusty” due to their limited experience on the same debate stage. Goldman previously advised Kennedy’s father, former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.), and his late great-uncle, longtime U.S. Senator Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54-’56 (D-Mass.).
“While they both have been campaigning, they’ve been campaigning independent of each other,” Goldman said. “I think there was a little bit of rust that could be seen.”
Kennedy and Markey will square off again Monday in a televised debate hosted by WPRI-TV and Gannett.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, two first-year Harvard Medical School students have developed a user review platform for COVID-19 testing sites.
The students — Dylan J. Cahill and J.C. Panagides — partnered with the crowdsolving company Groopit to develop their new platform, which collects first-hand, real-time experiences from individuals tested for COVID-19 in the U.S.
After first-year medical students were sent home in mid-March due to growing concerns over the pandemic, Cahill said he and Panagides began thinking of ways they could contribute to the fight against the novel coronavirus.
“Even though we were being taken out of our roles as medical students, there was some way that we could obviously contribute during this time, even remotely,” Cahill said.
In response to what they found to be “scattered information” available about testing centers, Cahill said the duo settled on creating a platform to track COVID-19 testing locations.
As the pandemic progressed and testing capacity increased, Cahill and Panagides expanded their project to document patients’ COVID-19 testing experience.
Tammy L. Savage, CEO and co-founder of Groopit, said the company was able to quickly adjust to the students’ new focus.
“One of the things that happens when you face a crisis is that the problems you're trying to solve and the information that you need from people changes as you go through the process,” Savage said. “The information that they were looking for changed, but Groopit is built so that almost instantaneously we can change what data they ask people to contribute.”
Cahill and Panagides’s platform asks users to share detailed information about their testing experience, serving “almost like Yelp reviews for COVID testing,” according to Panagides.
“We've decided that while people might be able to Google 'Where can I find the local testing center?,' there's still some hesitancy around that and getting a test,” Cahill said. “The tool now allows people to share more about what their experience was like, and that’ll include things like sharing what the wait time is, how long it took them to get test results, and what information was needed ahead of time.”
“We think that allowing people to see that information might make the experience a little bit easier and encourage them to go out and get tested themselves,” he added.
In order to ensure all data collection complies with HIPAA regulations regarding medical privacy and security, user data is “stripped of identity,” according to Savage.
“The critical piece of information that is protected under HIPAA is someone's medical history, because if they've gotten a test or a test result, then that's part of their medical history, and it needs to be protected,” Panagides added.
Panagides said he believes crowdsourcing itself will ensure a level of accuracy through a “system of checks and balances between users,” who can respond to each other’s reviews.
Savage also emphasized the ability of crowdsourcing to provide mass data for analysis.
“By looking at the data that’s contributed by a lot of people, you can start seeing the trends and the patterns, as well as the specific incidents and the anomalies, and have enough data that you can really start understanding the problem from multiple points of view,” Savage said.
As medical students, Cahill said he and Panagides are used to family members and friends asking for “knowledge and inspiration around these topics.” Now, they feel a sense of duty to help share such medical understanding more broadly.
“We thought by creating this app we could actually help serve that same mission but to a larger audience,” he said.
