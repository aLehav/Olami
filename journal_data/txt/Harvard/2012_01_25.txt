After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Keystone XL Pipeline was designed to carry oil to the Gulf of Mexico from the Canadian tar sands, a particularly dirty source of crude oil. According to NASA’s top climate scientist James Hansen, the full development of the Pipeline would mean “game over for the climate”. Infuriated by this threat to human security, environmental activists have organized rapidly in the past six months. 1252 activists were arrested in peaceful protest in August and over 10,000 showed up to surround the White House in November.  A few weeks later, Obama chose to postpone his decision on KXL until after the Presidential election.  House Republicans responded to this by pinning an article on KXL to the payroll tax cut extension bill, effectively forcing a decision on the pipeline within 60 days.
When forced to make the decision, Obama said no to the KXL construction permit.
In some ways, this is a victory.  Obama rejected an environmentally destructive proposal after the greatest surge of environmental activism in recent history. Normally fractured environmental groups joined forces to fight for the same goal, and won.  The power of people beat out the financial capital of the biggest corporations in the world.  This, after all, is why activism matters!
In other ways, however, Obama’s decision is not significant.  TransCanada, the corporation proposing the pipeline, will reapply for the construction permit in two weeks with a slightly different route.   The State Department will then take a year to complete a new investigation of its environmental effect, and the plan may be approved after that. In other words, Obama’s decision was not final.
Furthermore, as he announced his decision to deny the permit, Obama declared continued support for domestic oil development.  What happened to the President who announced in 2008 that he would end “the tyranny of oil”?  What happened to the President who pays attention to reality?
According to the International Energy Association, we have five years to seriously slow fossil fuel development, or else all hope of stopping irreversible climate change will be lost.  And the IEA is a conservative body, using standards for safe levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration that are often considered too high.
With five years at most to stop climate change, we cannot afford to develop fossil fuels further.  Supporters of KXL like to say that it is just one more pipeline and its negative impact on the climate is worth 5000 temporary jobs.  Some critics of the anti-KXL movement like pointing out that it would take 1000 years to fully develop the tar sands, arguing that Hansen’s “game over” quote doesn’t apply and KXL isn’t actually that important to climate change.
These arguments all miss the point. We don’t have 1000 years to wait for the tar sands to be completely developed—we have five years until the window of opportunity to combat climate change is “closed forever”, according to Faith Birol, chief economist of the IEA.   No pipeline, KXL or otherwise, is “just another pipeline” at this point.  Every piece of fossil fuel infrastructure that we build locks us into decades of deadly pollution that we cannot afford.
We have to reverse the trend, stop developing fossil fuels, and power the world using clean, safe energy sources.  This vision is not stupid or unrealistic. Engineers at Stanford and UC Davis have found that it would be possible to provide the entire world’s energy needs from clean, safe sources by 2050, keeping energy costs similar to those today.   This is not a question of technology or economics—it is a question of political will.
How do we get there?  For a start, we can stop wasting $10 billion each year on fossil fuel subsidies.  We can pass Representative Pete Stark’s “Save Our Climate Act” to set up a fee and dividend carbon taxing scheme which would protect citizens, encourage development of safe energy sources, and reduce the deficit.  American families shouldn’t have to worry about their financial situation being jeopardized by volatile oil prices.  American families shouldn’t spend their hard-earned money on energy that causes air pollution, damaging their health and increasing our nation’s healthcare costs.  We want our money going to clean energy programs that create sustainable jobs for Americans and strengthen our communities.
Clean energy development and investments in energy efficiency would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and save us billions of dollars.  Continued investments in fossil fuel infrastructure such as Keystone XL will cost us billions of dollars and destroy lives.
Do you really want to live in a country where corporate fossil fuel dictators steal your health, corrupt your democracy, and destroy your communities and safety for their profits?  I don’t.  Join me in the movement to win back our country and build a better future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Library System recently announced to employees that as part of an ongoing restructuring that aims to streamline its massive network of libraries it will seek to reduce the size of its workforce. Library Exectuve Director Helen Shenton announced the cuts at a series of town hall meetings last week, emphasizing that they will be merely one step of many in a wide-ranging modernization process. According to Robert C. Darnton ’60, the Harvard University Librarian, this process is designed to make the Harvard’s libraries more “efficient,” and is presumably connected to the effort to digitize large swathes of Harvard’s collection. Darnton himself has received attention over the past year for spearheading the Digitial Public Library of America project, a nationwide digitization scheme. As the University seeks to position itself at the forefront of twenty-first century technology, it is inevitable that some will find themselves negatively affected. The job cuts may be painful, but they are necessary for catching up with technological progress and dealing with Harvard’s bloated library infrastructure. We support Harvard’s plans, although we wish to see them carried out in a humane manner.
So far, the University seems to have been surprisingly untactful in its handling of a delicate situation. HULS’s rather sudden announcement of the potential workforce cuts left much to be desired. Employees do not know exactly what their fate will be, only that some will be laid off.  As a result of the dearth of information rumors have flourished. One worker posted to Twitter that “All of Harvard library staff have just effectively been fired.” The University has exacerbated this unhappy state of affairs by asking all employees to upload their personal information and resumes onto an online database, sparking speculation that existing workers will compete among themselves for a limited number of positions. Surely, a department with a workforce of nearly 1,000 could have known better.
As the library system transforms itself, current workers should be treated fairly. Those to be dismissed deserve fair warning—not the disappointing ambiguity so far provided—and severance pay. If possible, older workers close to retirement should be gradually phased out so that the cuts cause as little harm as possible. Furthermore, once the process of renewal concludes, remaining employees should not face a larger workload than is currently the norm. Technology may supplant some labor, but the employees that remain should not be made to deliver stressful levels of productivity.
Having said this, it is also necessary to remember that Harvard’s library system has one overarching goal, namely to facilitate academic progress both within the University and outside of it. The library system is not a government public works program, nor should it be. In order to provide the services that push the boundaries of knowledge forward, the libraries may have to shed some workers. While we commiserate with those who lose their jobs, we must recognize that sometimes the University must take unpleasant action. We just hope that it does so in a considerate and thoughtful manner consistent with Harvard’s historically positive labor track record.

Every year Gallup reminds us that our country is home to two proud conservatives for every self-described liberal. Statistics like this would seem to lend some empirical heft to the oft-trumpeted claim that “America is a center-right nation.” There is a serious problem in using data like the Gallup Political Ideologies Poll as evidence that Americans lean right. Since the poll relies exclusively on self-identification, it tells us much more about the comparative popularity of particular labels than it does about the actual policy preferences of Americans. The language of political identity is as subject to the whims of fashion as the length of men’s basketball shorts. The term “liberal” has undergone especially breakneck changes in popularity that would make even Britney Spears delirious.
In 1949, Harvard professor Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. ’38 published “The Vital Center”, a sort of blueprint for what we would now call post-war liberalism.  Schlesinger imagined liberalism as a fundamentally moderate doctrine to temper the extremities of hard-line leftism and reactionary rightism. Liberalism was wise moderation—an essential alternative to both the outmoded free-market conservatism of the Coolidge Republicans and the anti-individualistic ideology of the far-left.  The electoral success of self-proclaimed liberals like Roosevelt and Johnson evidenced the ideology’s popularity. In 1966, liberalism was so vogue that the folk musician Phil Ochs penned “Love me, I’m a liberal,” a satirical piece about conservatives masquerading as liberals because it was the popular thing to do.  It’s hard to imagine anyone accusing today’s self-described liberals of hidden conservatism. Today, “liberal” is most commonly hurled as an epithet at politicians like President Obama who parry the accusation by eschewing the stigmatized word for the more benign “progressive.” If Gallup tells us anything, it’s that most Americans run from liberalism.
Harvard (like many college campuses) is a place that bucks the national trend.  It almost goes without saying that the median Harvard student, if given a choice between self-describing as liberal or conservative, would chose liberal without too much thought.  Furthermore, Harvard’s liberals seem, by and large, to be aware of their leftward boundary in a way that belies their frequent caricature.  Yet our community has not been immune to changes in the nature of the term “liberal” that go beyond its transformation to a pejorative.
A conservative friend of mine tells me routinely that our communist friend is “super liberal,” to which I respond, “She’s not liberal; she’s communist.” Yet, to most contemporary Americans, there’s nothing at all odd about referring to communists as “more liberal” than liberals, although this was not always the case. There was a time when you could be (and many were) too far left to be called liberal. During the Korean War, for example, no one would have said that the Maoists were “more liberal” than Harry Truman.  “Liberal” did not apply to all ideologies on the left, much the same way that “conservative” does not apply to all ideologies on the right (was Hitler really “conservative?”).
There’s more at stake here than semantic drift. Although Americans probably have gotten more conservative in their policy preferences since midcentury, it’s also true that the term “liberal” has changed. It would be wrong to say just that it has moved left, because those leaders who were liberal in the ‘40s are still considered liberal today.  Rather, it has been stretched to include not only its original ideological territory, but also the far reaches of the radical left. As a consequence, it has garnered the distaste that comes with radical leftism in America.
Many who might have espoused liberalism and its various tenets if it still denoted a discreet identity with a leftward bound have opted instead to identify as “moderate” or even “conservative.” Their dispositional preferences for steadiness outweigh their would-be support for genuinely left-wing policies. And unfortunately for those of us still holding down the liberal fort, people choose their politics in packages.  A person who is drawn to moderation (or merely away from hard leftism) today identifies as a “moderate,” and seems required to take a different posture towards, say, the capital gains tax than she would if liberalism were still attractive to the dispositionally moderate .
How did liberalism come to connote both moderate leftism and radicalism, thereby alienating would-be liberals with a penchant for the moderate aesthetic?  The most likely candidate is the Vietnam War.  Liberalism’s old guard lost all credibility through the blind escalation in Vietnam and paved the way for a New Left that opposed to the policy of containment and that placed addressing the root causes of crime—such as poverty and racism—ahead of law and order.  This, together with typical right-wing cunning, allowed conservatives to paint liberals as soft on defense and crime.
On the other hand, conservatives have lost public responsibility for reactionaries. Even the mildest suggestion that there are lingering racist factions on the American right draws unparalleled indignation from conservatives.  It’s rather unfair that liberals have had to take on the baggage of the far left. In response, so-called progressives ought to reclaim the liberal mantle and push back: after all, Castro is not “more liberal” than anybody.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, 2011 was a good year for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. In December, the United Nations issued its first ever report on LGBT rights. At the same time, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared to the United Nations that “gay rights are human rights.” Clinton’s speech, which challenged governments to commit to the protection of LGBT rights, was delivered in conjunction with the anniversary of the passage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, the UN report and Clinton’s speech neglect the dangers of an internationally enforced LGBT rights program in a world where power is unequally distributed.
The UN’s efforts are bold. They take place within a climate of increasing hostility against LGBT people in countries like Nigeria, Uganda, Malaysia, Hungary, and Russia. The report condemns the insurmountable number of discriminatory practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, singling out discrimination against LGBT people as particularly violent and vicious. It lists several recommendations to UN member countries, urging them to commit to the protection of LGBT rights by decriminalizing homosexuality, abolishing the death penalty for consensual sex relations, passing anti-discrimination legislation, protecting LGBT refugees and asylum seekers, and educating the public to counter homophobia and transphobia.
While Clinton remained sensitive to the “personal, political, cultural, and religious beliefs” that pose challenges to the global commitment to protect LGBT rights, her speech emphasized the fact that LGBT rights are not a “Western invention” but a “human reality.” Her efforts are timely, if not a little overdue, and crucial to ensuring cross-cultural and transnational support for LGBT rights.
However, Clinton’s speech and the release of the report should not obscure the underside of globally recognized LGBT rights, spearheaded by countries of former (and existing) colonial power and whose values are historically articulated in the form of individual rights and freedoms. Countries like the United   Kingdom are considering tying their foreign aid to the condition that countries receiving aid end their bans on homosexuality. I hesitate to congratulate such efforts: if the UK is not careful, other countries might interpret them as a recapitulation of past imperialism. Holding countries at ransom for the sake of expanding LGBT rights must not come at the expense of developing good governance, reducing poverty, and improving other human rights. Withholding aid will not be an effective tool of LGBT rights promotion, especially against a backdrop of unequal geopolitical power and histories of colonialism.
In fact, existing laws banning same-sex intercourse in countries like Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore are a legacy of British colonialism. In Uganda, a proposed anti-homosexuality bill that would have sentenced homosexuals to life imprisonment or death was financially backed and promoted by US-linked evangelical groups. The events that followed the murder of David Kato, an LGBT rights activist, sparked an intense global protest that eventually stalled the bill’s passage. However, extreme homophobia still remains and may have even been exacerbated by international pressure.
Indeed, rigorous international campaigns can jeopardize local LGBT activism and put grassroots activists in danger. Several African countries have pushed back against Clinton’s speech. News portals in South Africa and Liberia have noted Africa’s weariness over what they see as a Western preoccupation with the issue of LGBT rights. An opinion piece published in New Dawn Liberia urged President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who spoke at Harvard during last year’s commencement ceremony, to say “no to infesting Liberia and Africa for money.” A few weeks later, President Sirleaf’s minister announced that the president would not be signing any law decriminalizing homosexuality.
While foreign development aid and international relations play an important role in expanding LGBT rights protections, the UN must also support local LGBT rights groups. The UN report and Clinton’s UN address have already sparked new conversations for governments and organizations, opening up spaces for LGBT groups to gain much-needed visibility for their work. However, these international efforts must remain sensitive, supportive, and collaborative if they are to continue successfully.
The UN’s new focus on LGBT rights should be used to offer support to local activists and governments, not to perpetuate economic and social inequalities. No doubt, cultural relativism is not an excuse for defending human rights violations. However, it is only with some humility and sensitivity that international LGBT rights advocacy can spur difficult, collaborative actions that lead to the protection of the dignity and rights of all human beings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, University President Drew G. Faust discussed single-sex education, public health, and the importance of a liberal arts model at institutions in Mumbai and Delhi.
“Knowledge has become the primary driver of social mobility, and of the prosperity and well-being of individuals and nations,” she said to a nonprofit educational institution called the Asia Society at a speech in Mumbai on Jan. 19.
Faust’s visit to the J.B. Petit High School for Girls focused on female empowerment. Faust met with a group of students, predominantly tenth graders, and learned the popular saying “Educate a man, educate a man. Educate a woman, educate a family,” according to The Harvard Gazette.
“Empowerment of the women has been our mission...women’s education has always been at the forefront of this school,” said J.B. Petit Principal Benaifer P. Kutar, in a video made by the Gazette. “I think in an Indian context it is especially important because it has been a traditionally conservative society.”
The students learned about Faust before her visit, studying her life and speeches, so they could ask questions and share ideas.
“India does need to change a lot of old mindsets because it’s not the old world anymore,” said a student in the video.
“I wouldn’t be here if it was still the old world. I would be sitting at home probably chopping vegetables.”
Faust has consistently visited all-girls’ schools during her travels abroad. She reminded the students that she had attended an all-women’s high school and college and encouraged them to “dream big dreams.”
At the University of Mumbai, Faust also discussed the increased rapidity of communication and the benefits of a liberal arts education in a globalized world.
“As I see it, Faust’s visit to Bombay has established something quite new and significant for Harvard’s iconic image in India,”  Professor Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, wrote on the website of the Gazette.
“Here, Harvard has frequently been portrayed as a celebrated business school with a few small annexes across the river. Faust’s persistent emphasis in Mumbai on the humanities as an indispensable partner to scientific and professional learning will enhance Harvard’s global presence and enrich its conversations on campus and at home.”
During the second phase of her trip, Faust traveled to Delhi where she met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the South Asia Initiative Education Symposium, the Harvard Club of India, and the Public Health Foundation of India.
On Monday, she met with leaders of PHFI, which is a public-private initiative to strengthen public health in India.
Faust discussed Indian health care issues with K. Srinath Reddy—President of PHFI and a visiting professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health—and Harvard Kennedy School professor A. K. Shiva Kumar.
The meeting focused on a 2006 agreement between Harvard and PHFI to promote the development of research collaborations and programs in research and education, including student exchanges and faculty visits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When students returning from winter break walked into the basement of Cabot House’s E entryway, they were met not by the familiar aroma of coffee that greeted them last semester but by the sights and sounds of a construction zone.
The managers of Cabot Café, a student-operated coffeehouse which opened last year, received a $70,000 grant from the College and Faculty of Arts and Sciences to renovate the new social space.
Jesse J. Kaplan ’13, Cabot Café’s founder and general manager, said that after a successful spring preview period and full launch during the fall semester, the café needs more funds to expand its operations.
“It was clear that we needed more money to really open the restaurant,” Kaplan said. “We were trying to take a completely open unused social space and turn it into a fully functional Starbucks, and that’s really hard.”
Kaplan said that the updates will include additional power outlets in the walls and columns to facilitate laptop use, new floors and lighting, and improved kitchen equipment.
Thanks to an additional grant from the Office for the Arts, the café managers also plan to display more student artwork on the refurbished walls.
“We’re pretty much improving everything that we can and we’re really confident that it’s going to be much better for customers in the next few weeks,” Kaplan said.
In addition to aesthetic improvements, the remodelling will allow the café to offer a “more expansive and much cheaper” menu, he added.
More refrigeration units and a blender will enable the café—where the most popular drinks last semester were the chai latte and spiced apple cider—to serve juice-based drinks and frozen concoctions, items which Kaplan said many customers have requested.
The changes will also improve working conditions for the baristas and managers.
According to Marie-Fatima K. Hyacinthe ’14, a Cabot Café employee, the space did not have its own sink last semester, forcing workers to load dirty dishes on carts and bring them upstairs to wash.
“I like the changes that are going to be made behind the scenes,” Hyacinthe said. “It will be easier for the staff working there.”
According to Kaplan, about 50 to 100 students patronized the café each night last semester. He hopes that the renovated space will draw even bigger crowds.
Currier resident Jacob J. Cedarbaum ’12—who said his favorite Cabot Café snack is the dessert from Petsi Pies, a Cambridge bakery—said he was happy to have access to a social space in the Quad last semester.
“I like that it was a cozy area of the Quad for students to hang out, do work, and I especially like that it is open in the evening and late at night,” Cedarbaum said.
Kaplan said he hopes the renovation will be finished by mid-February.
“We’re really excited to reopen,” Kaplan said.
“We think it will be virtually unrecognizable to most of the public because we’re changing so many aesthetic and operational things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University’s plans to reduce the size of the Harvard University Library workforce drew criticism Tuesday from library workers and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. Library officials informed employees of the University's exploration of a range of both voluntary and involuntary options in a series of town hall meetings last Thursday.
“The announcement that the library workforce ‘will be smaller than it is now’ and that some of these potential reductions will be involuntary, combined with the lack of answers to critical questions was alarming and ill-conceived,” read an email to members of HUCTW, which represents many library employees. “For many, the overall effect was panic-inducing.”
The union plans to address the issue by discussing the potential cuts in greater detail with library leaders and meeting with members to assess their reactions, according to the email.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that his union is concerned primarily with the lack of information provided by the University about the size and nature of the potential layoffs. The presentation of the plans, he said, was “extraordinarily clumsy” and left many major questions unanswered.
Library employees also expressed confusion over the details of the plan. The uncertainty has led many employees to begin speculating on the size of the cuts, according to Karen L. O’Brien, a library assistant.
“All of Harvard Library staff have just effectively been fired,” read one tweet that circulated on Thursday after the first town hall had begun.
Others suggested that the restructuring would require that all library employees reapply to keep their current positions.
The University strongly refuted this statement but recommended that all employees file an Employee Profile “to state job preferences, to articulate skills, and to provide a resume.”
Although he said that the University is currently only providing “vague” explanations, Jaeger is confident that HUCTW will be able to speak with transition leaders. As a part of the union’s contract, Harvard must consult with HUCTW and seriously consider alternative options before laying off a single member, he said.
But HUCTW’s response was insufficient for some union members who gathered on Tuesday afternoon to take a more aggressive stance against the plan for a smaller workforce.
The meeting, which included representatives from the Student Labor Action Movement and Occupy Harvard, concluded with a plan to picket University forums on library reform beginning Wednesday.
For this small, committed group of activists, preparing for a larger campaign would start with reaching out to other employees. Eventually, workers could resort to large demonstrations or another occupation of the campus, said Geoffrey “Geoff” Carens, an assistant librarian and HUCTW member.
“It’s going to get as big as it needs to be,” Carens said. “This is the seed, and we’re hoping for a mighty tree.”
Library employees who attended Tuesday’s meeting expressed frustration with both the plan to cut the workforce and how the University informed employees. At Thursday’s meeting, library officials were unable to answer many of the audience’s questions and did not provide details about the scale of the staff reductions. That information, employees were told, would come in February.
O’Brien said she believes that the University is purposefully stoking fear among the library employees in hopes that they will hurriedly accept unattractive retirement packages.
Regardless of their thoughts about the University’s intentions, many other employees expressed a fear of the upcoming changes.
“I can’t believe I feel as insecure in my job as I did before we had the union,” said Jeffrey Booth, a library assistant who said he has worked at Harvard for 25 years. “We’re already short-staffed. When my friends and coworkers get laid off, I get physically sick. That’s how it affects you.”
The Harvard Library Board, which is responsible for planning the library’s restructuring, met Tuesday to discuss the plan. If approved, it will be considered by University President Drew G. Faust.
The University did not return repeated requests for comment on this article. Harvard Library Executive Director Helen Shenton did not respond through a spokesperson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 350 people—Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike—watched President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address together at the Institute of Politics on Tuesday night.
“We were super excited to organize this, and we invited the Dems and the Republicans. It’s a good way to kick off the semester,” IOP President Jenny Ye ’13 said.
Julia B. Konrad ’13, the IOP vice president, said that the nonpartisan political organization was an ideal host for the viewing party. “The IOP is exactly the place to watch things like this,” she said. “The IOP is a central point to talk about ideas.”
According to Michael W. McLean ’12, former president of the Harvard Republican Club, this was the first year in recent memory that students supporting both parties watched the annual presidential speech together rather than at separate events.
“People care about what’s going on,” McLean said. “This year, [watching] together is a nice change of pace.”
In the speech, Obama addressed a host of issues including job creation, tax reform, education, and energy. He also spoke about the gulf between Democrats and Republicans, a gap which the students at the IOP bridged for the night by watching the speech together but also exemplified in their divergent reactions to the president’s remarks.
Adan Acevedo ’13, president of the Harvard College Democrats, said after Obama’s speech, “We’re very excited that he has decided to renew America’s focus on American infrastructure and skills and education for Americans deprived of them currently, and being extremely considerate of students who are paying high tuition rates.”
He added, “We think that Obama’s emphasis on FDR and Eisenhower was well placed because the focus of this election should not be partisanship but moving America forward.”
But Derek J. Bekebrede ’13, the president of the Republican Club, highlighted another reference Obama made to one of his illustrious predecessors.
“In the speech was a quote from a Republican, from Abraham Lincoln. I think it shows that Americans are ready to support a conservative theory of government,” Bekebrede said. “I don’t think the speech will reinvigorate America to vote for Obama.”
Others said that the speech lacked a dynamic theme. “My big fear looking at 2012 is that Obama has lost his magic. He needs to give us a vision of the future, not a laundry list,” said Max D. Novendstern ’12, former editor-in-chief of the Harvard Political Review.
Neil Patel ’13, managing editor of the Harvard Political Review, also said he was struck by the long list of issues in the speech, an annual summary of the major concerns facing the nation.
“Nothing particularly stood out to me. He had a lot of ideas, but it looked like he didn’t believe in them,”  Patel said.
The viewers at the IOP seemed to agree on one statement, whatever their political affiliation—the joint watch party was a success.
“The event was a fantastic show of how the Republicans, Democrats, the IOP will have a lasting partnership despite different views on certain policies,” Acevedo said.

After an Allentown city councilman resigned mid-term, Harvard graduate Brad M. Paraszczak ’11 has applied for the vacant seat in his Pennsylvania hometown. Paraszczak, who served as the treasurer of the Undergraduate Council, said his experience with public service and interest in policy questions motivated him to jump into the political arena on a local level.
“This decision is not about politics as much as it is about public policy, which is why I intend to only serve out the remainder of the term,” Paraszczak said. He noted that by avoiding fundraising and campaigning, he will remain focused on researching issues and finding solutions to various municipal problems.
Currently, eleven others are vying for the spot that was vacated when former Councilman Michael D’Amore stepped down to take the position of magisterial district judge in December. The city council will publicly vote for a replacement by Jan. 31.
“[Brad’s] run for city council is far from surprising,” current UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 said. “He has always sought to be informed on current issues and local governance…and his knowledge of finance and concern for local issues will permit him to consider the city budget from a fresh, informed standpoint and address residents’ concerns.”
Yalamanchi, who worked with Paraszczak on the UC, recalled him as one of the most dedicated officers during his two years of service.
“During his time as treasurer, he reformed UC finance,” she said. “He streamlined the UC funding and allocation process and increased transparency.”
In addition to handling the UC’s nearly half million dollar budget, Paraszczak served as a Kirkland House Committee Chair and the treasurer.
“Not only did he do a better job of it than most people, he did it without getting paid, without ever asking for recognition—all while balancing schoolwork and other extracurriculars,” former UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 said.
With his experiences, Paraszczak said he hopes to address what he sees as the major issues faced by most municipalities—including education, economic development, finance, infrastructure investment, and public safety.
“When you really study the issues, you see that everything is interconnected,” the former government concentrator said.
Paraszczak has also served as a congressional intern, where he researched health care and financial reforms and worked extensively on labor issues, education reform, and economic development.
As the youngest candidate for the seat, Paraszczak said he hopes that his decision to run will inspire more young people to engage in politics.
“Age alone should not be a disqualifying factor in politics,” Paraszczak said.
“If our generation is lauded for changing the face of business, science, technology and public service, why shouldn’t our voices be heard in government as well?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A sizeable minority of patients diagnosed with lung and colorectal cancer continued smoking after their diagnosis, according to a recent Harvard Medical School study published in the journal Cancer.
Though the percentage of smokers universally decreased in that time period, the study—headed by Harvard Medical School Associate Professor of Psychology Elyse R. Park—found a disparity in the number of those quitting between the two types of cancer.
“The proportion of smokers that quit was actually lower among colorectal cancer patients, and in that case I think it’s probably because they don’t perceive their cancer as being related to smoking,” said HMS Associate Professor of Health Care Policy Nancy L. Keating, also a researcher on the study.
The researchers analyzed a sample of over 5,000 lung and colorectal cancer patients and compared the percentage of patients who were smoking at the time of diagnosis with the number still smoking five months later.
HMS Health Care Policy Assistant Professor Yulei He, who was not involved in the research,  did not express surprise at the study’s findings. He said that patients who are diagnosed with something as traumatizing as cancer may not have the willpower to quit smoking or, if their treatments are effective, even feel the need to do so.
Further, Park said that the “embarrassment and stigma” of being diagnosed with cancer as a smoker may further deter patients from quitting.
“It’s a time when many feel very helpless,” Park said.
The study’s findings also raise questions about the role that medical professionals play in helping their patients overcome smoking addictions.
“I think physicians in general probably need more training in effective motivational techniques to help get their patients to quit,” Keating said. “The challenges of taking care of patients with 15-minute visits [do] make spending a lot of time thinking and talking about smoking cessation very challenging.”
Despite the difficulties associated with getting smokers to quit, Keating said there is hope for greater success in the future. For example, other health professionals could provide physicians with more training in counseling patients on smoking cessation.
Yet ultimately the percentage of cancer patients who cut the habit will only increase if they are motivated enough to make a change, according to Keating.
“I just think it’s never too late to do something to help yourself,” Park said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of the recent death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and the shift of power to his son Kim Jong-un, a panel of Harvard professors said that fears of internal collapse in North Korea have not been realized. The experts said that although North Korean policy has scarcely changed since the long-time leader’s death, Korean citizens nevertheless see the transition as a moment to hope for reunification of the Koreas.
The speakers emphasized stability as the primary objective for the sake of international security.
“There is a common interest to prevent conflict in the Korean Peninsula,” said Kennedy School professor Anthony Saich. “The last thing that we want is destabilization in North Korea brought about by a failed succession.”
Saich’s worst-case scenario has not unfolded since Kim Jong-il’s death on Dec. 17. The state’s military leadership has remained loyal to his successor Kim Jong-un and internal policy remains unchanged, panelists said.
“Just because one person changes, it doesn’t mean that the whole system breaks down,” said Ja-Yoon Choe ’12, who lived in South Korea for 13 years.
The panelists enumerated several important diplomacy issues on which Kim Jong-un’s stances look similar to his father’s.
Tensions between North and South Korea, which escalated when North Korea allegedly sunk a South Korean naval ship in March 2010, have not eased. North Korea has also shown no signs of ending its nuclear program, despite past demands from foreign governments that the research cease.
“Russian officials have no expectation or hope at all that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons program,” said Mark Kramer, the program director of the Harvard Project on Cold War Studies.
Despite such efforts by Kim Jong-un to maintain his father’s legacy, many still wish that in the absence of Kim Jong-il, the two Koreas will finally reunite, panelists said.
Chang Hoon Lee, a third-year college student visiting from Kyungpook National University in Daegu, South Korea, said that he feels his country cannot move forward economically unless it resolves its conflict with its northern neighbor.
“South Korea has a lot of limitations because of North Korea,” Lee said. “If North Korea and South Korea united, there is a chance for South Korea to reach a higher level.”
Korean history professor Sun Joo Kim, however, said that Koreans’ wish for reunification is fading.
“Twenty or thirty years ago, a lot of South Korean people had families living in the North, so they wanted to be connected and be reunited,” Kim said.  “But now, that generation is getting old.”
Moreover, no steps are being taken toward reunification. “So far, everything seems to be holding, and history suggests that it will continue,” Korean history professor Carter J. Eckert said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 54-38 win over Dartmouth on Saturday, one of the team’s seven rookies led the Crimson. It wasn’t Kenyatta Smith—ESPN’s 17th ranked center from the high school class of 2011—nor Wesley Saunders—who committed to Harvard over offers from USC, San Diego State, and Colorado. It was Corbin Miller, a 6'2'' point guard from Sandy, Utah.
Miller poured in 13 points, connecting on three-of-four three-point attempts. His performance earned him Ivy League Rookie of the Week and cemented his position as a key role player for the team.
“I think he is a very confident player,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think he is a kid that believes he belongs and is capable. He steps up in big moments and is not afraid to take a big shot, and he has certainly made some for us.”
The freshman guard’s shooting ability was what originally caught the eye of Harvard recruiters.
Miller has continued his accurate shooting as a Crimson player, netting 59.3 percent of shots from three-point range (16 of 27) over the course of the season.
“That was one of the reasons we were really attracted to him—his ability to shoot the basketball,” Amaker noted. “But he’s more than that.  He has handled the ball a little better than I thought he would against pressure.  His foot speed is a little bit better than I thought it was from watching him in high school.”
Amaker also emphasized the ease with which Miller has been able to transition to college play, learning the Harvard system quickly.
“I just came in with the attitude of working hard and trying to help the team in whatever way I could,” Miller said.  “[I want to] keep developing, getting used to the college game, learning how to make quicker decisions, and helping to lead when I’m in.”
Co-captain Oliver McNally has served as a mentor and guide for Miller during his first season on the team.
“He really got going in the Atlantis tournament,. He hit some big shots,” McNally said. “He didn’t look as comfortable being a point guard, being a leader…but now, I remember at the end of the Dartmouth game I was saying ‘go ahead, take the ball’ in late-clock situations. He was such a dominant high school player, and he is starting to channel that on the college level.”
Despite Miller’s success on the court thus far, he was forced to sit out three games due to injury.
“We missed [Miller] in a couple of games when he hurt his thumb,” McNally said. “I think it hurt us in the Fordham game because he was playing but he definitely wasn’t himself.  Going into the next few games without him, we missed that presence coming off of the bench.”
But Harvard will have to manage without him next season.
Miller has decided to leave the confines of Cambridge to embark on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
“I wish we had him,” Amaker said.
Miller’s absence will be a tough loss     for the Crimson, but the freshman has made an important commitment to his Mormon faith that will keep him from Crimson basketball over the next two seasons.
Yet despite many of Miller’s teammates’ unfamiliarity with Mormonism, Amaker was supportive of his decision and mindful of the consequences for the team.
“We made [Miller’s family] aware of the community that we have and all of the Harvard students who have gone on their mission and come back,” Amaker said. “Once they were comfortable looking at it from an avenue and perspective that this is part of what we have done in the past—maybe not so much a basketball player, but other students here at Harvard—they were very comfortable looking at this as a serious option for him.”
Miller is very clear about his values and priorities.  He recognized the Crimson program and style of play as a good fit for him, while acknowledging the fact that he could maintain his commitment to education and religion as a Harvard student.
“[My faith] is something that is really important to me, and it always has been that way,” Miller said. “It’s really who I am, the things that I’ll be doing.  I’ll be able to go out and serve other people, and share a message that brings joy to my life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping a tight third set in its season opener, the Harvard men’s volleyball team buckled down and defeated Endicott, 3-1, in Beverly, Mass., on Tuesday night.
During the hard-fought third set, the young Crimson (1-0) team struggled with its service game, which opened the door for the Gulls.
“We were up, but we missed a couple of serves here and there. They started to come back, and we let them get into it,” said freshman middle hitter Caleb Zimmick.
As Harvard refocused its serves, it overcame its third-set loss with a strong fourth game.
“We started going for the real tough serves right down the line,” said sophomore opposite hitter Nick Madden. “We put some pace behind them and got them in.”
The Crimson received standout performances in the season opener from freshmen Caleb Zimmick and DJ White. The two took control of the net with a combined 20 kills.
“Our freshmen definitely stepped up,” Madden said. “Caleb played well in the middle, and [co-captain] Matt [Jones] on the outside also played very well.”
Jones recorded a double-double for Harvard with 17 kills and 10 digs, helping carry the team to the 3-1 victory over the Gulls (0-1).
The match opened with a back-and-forth struggle, and Harvard grappled with Endicott’s offensive attack during the opening game.
“Endicott ran a pretty unpredictable offense,” Madden said. “They didn’t do a lot of the traditional hits. They ran a back three and some different unique approaches which took us a bit to adjust to.”
The teams alternated leads nine times in the first frame. With both squads tied at 17, Madden gave Harvard the 18-17 advantage with a timely kill. The visitors didn’t relinquish the lead from there, going on to win its first set of the season, 25-21.
In the following games, the Crimson found success in keeping the rallies short and preventing the Gulls from getting into a rhythm.
“On the points [when] we were able to get the rallies finished quickly, we had the best chance, since they are a team that really likes to extend rallies and make you make mistakes,” Jones said. “In game two, we did a good job of keeping the rallies short.”
With the game plan to shorten points, Harvard kept rolling in the second set, as it quickly built a 10-5 lead. White and Zimmick continued to dictate net play as they lead the team to a 25-17 win.
“Our freshman Caleb played great in the middle,” Jones said. “He dominated the net and hit at a really high percentage. He played very composed and really impressed me. I thought he was our MVP today.”
On the day, Zimmick committed only one error on 13 kills and recorded a team-high kill percentage of 75 percent.
During the entire match, the Crimson’s serve set the tone for its attack.
“I think the key to today’s match was serving,” Madden said. “When our serves were in, we took games easily, but as soon as we started missing serves, that’s when the game turned.”
As the third set rolled around, the Crimson’s serve began to falter. Despite opening up a six-point lead, Harvard left the door open just enough.
“We were up quite a bit, but we got a little tense, and we can’t play that way if we want to win,” Zimmick said.
With the help of Harvard’s service errors and strong performances from attackers Josh Anderson and Jeremy Siden, Endicott’s offense hit its stride. On the day, Anderson and Siden each recorded 11 kills.
The Crimson and Gulls traded points deep into the third before Endicott pulled away for a 30-28 victory.
In the fourth game, Harvard regained confidence in its serve, which sparked the offense.
Knotted at 9-9 in the final set, the Crimson offensive attack found its stride and put the pressure on Endicott’s defense.
“Our outer passing was good, and our offense really clicked,” Zimmick said. “The setters were able to find the open hitters, and we were quite balanced, which helped a lot.”
Harvard opened up a 16-10 lead and didn’t look back, as it pulled away for a 25-17 win in the decisive fourth set.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football looked golden two months ago. It had just won the program’s 14th Ivy title in dominant fashion—the heavyweight champ taking on a field of lightweights. It had steamrolled to an easy 45-7 win at the Yale Bowl, embarrassing the Bulldogs en route to its 10th win in 11 Games.
But then, slowly, things started to unravel.
Much of this was expected. Stars like quarterback Collier Winters hit the road. Defensive tackle Josue Ortiz said sayonara.
That’s all natural; it is the inexorable march and the immutable ebb and flow of college sports. A good thing won’t—can’t—last forever.
But what happened next, no one expected.
Yale coach Tom Williams resigned amid allegations that he lied on his resume, and to fill the open position, the Bulldogs tapped Harvard coach Tony Reno.
So far Reno has churned out All-Ivy stars at a remarkable pace, produced some of the nation’s stingiest secondaries, and won the AFLAC National Assistant Coach of the Year award in 2002.
No one could blame Reno for his decision. It’s not everyday that you’re offered the chance to run a major football program.
In his press conference, Reno expressed his deep admiration for Harvard coach Tim Murphy and his program.
“He prepares [his team] to be great players on and off the field,” Reno said. “Those are pieces I’m going to bring here to make Yale successful.”
Turns out, those weren’t the only pieces Reno took with him to New Haven.
The newly-hired coach lured away three other Harvard assistant coaches: Kris Barber, Joe Conlin, and Dwayne Wilmot. In a matter of two weeks, four of the nine assistant coaches have traded the Crimson for the Bulldogs, bringing with them Murphy’s whole bag of tricks.
Et tu, Brute?
Generally, when coaches leave, they sugarcoat it. They’ll say they’re looking forward to working with this coach or excited about that opportunity.
But those common courtesies vanished this time around. Seemingly no one pretended otherwise—this one was about better cash and better titles. Sold to the highest bidder. Part Sotheby’s, part Iago.
Even the generally understated Murphy was blunt about it.
“The bottom line is that Yale made them very lucrative offers financially along with titles,” he wrote in an email.
It was just that simple.
And better still, these coaches—Reno included—find themselves in a win-win situation. If Yale suddenly leapfrogs to the top of the Ivy League standings, then they’re all geniuses, cut from the same cloth as legendary Yale coach Carm Cozza. If not, well, they haven’t had the time to grow their own talent, or they lost Pat Witt, or they’re still just learning. Or something like that.
But in luring away almost half of the Crimson coaching staff, Yale and Reno made an explicit decision. Clearly, the Bulldogs couldn’t crack the Murphy enigma. The 18-year Crimson coach has beaten Yale like a drum. And the Bulldogs have tried everything from new coaches to fake punts. Nothing has helped Yale’s cause. So how do you knock down the champ?
Blindside him.  Do something he would never expect. There’s no ref to call this one, so go on, hit him below the belt! Maybe that will send him reeling.
And then go for the knockout blow.
Did Yale’s uppercut finally hit? Could Reno and the Bulldogs—along with the graduation of the Harvard’s talented senior class—have TKOed Murphy and the Crimson, ending the Golden Age of modern-era Harvard football?
Don’t count on it.
Under the winningest coach in Crimson history, with different players and assistant coaches cycling through at a rapid clip, Harvard just keeps on winning.
With Murphy still at the helm and a host of current and future stars returning, don’t expect things to change in 2012. It’ll take more than a few cheap shots to steal away that championship belt.
