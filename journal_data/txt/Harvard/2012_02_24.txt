After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the last thirty years, Edward W. Said’s book “Orientalism” has dominated—suffocated would be the less polite word—scholarship on the Arab world. According to his devotees, Said “proved” that the West collectively and systemically fictionalized the Arab world and the third world in general, in order to affirm its own ostensibly superior identity and delegitimize and dehumanize the “Orient.” He coined the term “Orientalism” to describe this phenomenon. With the inception of the Arab Spring (or whatever you want to call it), that term has returned to popular language. Protesters around the Arab world have screamed kifaya (enough!) to dictatorial rule and Orientalism’s tyrannical influence on scholarship and punditry deserves a similarly clamorous denunciation.
As a work of social science, Said’s followers interpret “Orientalism,” with accidental irony and fragile evidence, as an argument that systematically delegitimizes all prior and current Western understandings of the Arab world. As a critique of Western historical scholarship on the nineteenth and early twentieth century, Orientalism has elements of truth. However, in the field of social science, what became known as “Orientalism” simply replaced Orientalism with—if you will allow me—Occidentalism. In rebutting the formation of one generalizing “other,” Said set the ground for the production of a second “other.”
Today, “Orientalism” is a crux for attacking any opinion or presentation of facts that displays skepticism toward anything in the Arab world. An editorial on the Huffington Post is emblematic of this ruse: “A classical orientalist construction would be equating Islam with terrorism…Rather than acknowledge the heterogeneity of thought and behavior among Muslims.” Of course, one can both acknowledge that heterogeneity and attribute some piece of modern terrorism to Islam. But, like Orientalism itself, “Orientalism” creates for its believers a fictional foe in order to affirm their own identities.  
The authority of “Orientalism” in the social sciences, in particular those related to Middle Eastern studies, is difficult, if not impossible, to underestimate. Most studies on the modern Middle  East, and some in the social sciences in general, begin, and often revolve around, the ideas made famous by Said. This influence reaches far beyond the university gates and extends through media into the very center of narratives on social justice, international relations, and their intersection.
Newspapers, assorted journals, and seemingly every editorial on Al-Jazeera all indicate that Said is more or less the Paul R. Krugman of Middle Eastern studies—you don’t have to agree with him, but you do have to read him.
Fortunately, the impetus for removing Said’s Occidentalism from the heart of Middle Eastern studies can actually be found within Said’s work itself.
Said’s “Orientalism” represents an idealistic rejection of greed and wealth as motivating factors in intellectual pursuit. In “Orientalism” and other works, he chronicled how European artists, scholars, and intellectuals of the nineteenth and early twentieth century created a reality that served their countries’ imperial interests. Excusing for a moment the thickness of the brush Said paints with to prove his point, any thinker should concur with Said on the dangers of a marriage between academia and moneyed interests.
But the pernicious proliferation of Said’s theory demonstrates that academia’s inertia and magnitude can be as influential and debilitative as colonial interests. Ideas follow not only the interests of money, but also the internal interests of scholars who thrive in academia by gratifying and expanding its existing assumptions and theories.
As is often the case in the softest of sciences, when the theory of Orientalism entered the ivory tower to rabid applause and hastily unfurled red carpets, it quickly transmogrified into dogma. When an idea is accepted as a truism, it quickly becomes a platitude that every generation of scholars passes on to the next as a piece of collective identity. Academia may be where great ideas originate, but it is also where bad ideas live far beyond their use or truth. We should reject “Orientalism” for the same reason Said rejected Orientalism—it is a false reality sustained only by self-affirming interests. Like all non-scientific dogma, “Orientalism” is a truth within itself without truth.
I do not intend to make Said’s mistake; I recognize that “academia” is not monolithic and that no system of thought can be truly all encompassing. Of course, scholars produced and continue to produce critiques of “Orientalism,” but, in general, those critiques are undermined while Said’s theory remains relatively unchallenged in comparison. Nor do I intend to imply that stereotypes about Muslims and Arabs are not horribly reprehensible, but they are not unique, either. All cultures identify themselves by collectively dehumanizing others, but Orientalism, the theory, does that far more frequently than any vestigial clusters of Orientalism itself.
One valuable conclusion of Orientalism is that any social theory should be met with fierce skepticism in both its substance and its sources. Said’s acolytes would do well to remember that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It would seem that the national Occupy movement has reached an impasse. After months of successfully occupying and defending encampments in cities small and large across the country, most of the major sites (like Los Angeles with 500 tents and Boston with 200) have been raided by police and demolished.
Political leaders on the right applauded the national crackdown, even as the World Press Freedom Index dropped the United States 27 spots on their yearly ranking explicitly because of the government’s assault on the Occupy movement.
And yet, Occupy lives. Just last week, Occupy Harvard supporters occupied the Lamont Library cafe, taking aim at a specific target—the University’s attack on librarians’ jobs—and creating a platform to demand overhaul of University policy on the whole. On the national level, however, Occupy Harvard seems to be an anomaly, and many on the right are gleefully writing its obituary.
To understand what it means when an “Occupy” movement is not occupying anything, it is useful to look at the original “Occupy”: Tahrir Square. Unbeknownst to many Americans, the style of protest that Occupy embodies—spatial occupation—was directly inspired by the success of the 2011-2012 Egyptian revolution that began on January 25. After years of one-off protests against the oppressive Egyptian dictatorship (which receives $2 billion in US military aid every year), protesters decided that instead of going home after the protest, they were going to stay. And stay they did.
As the past year has shown, governments are infuriated when protestors decide not to go home after a protest. The Egyptian police responded brutally to the occupation of Tahrir, Cairo’s main square, but after weeks of attacks and the deaths of over 800 people, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was forced to resign.
The story didn’t end there. Reactionary forces in the military have since cracked down on dissent and repeatedly attacked protesters who have tried unsuccessfully to re-occupy Tahrir Square. Meanwhile, general support for the protests has wavered because some have been pacified with the fall of the president, and many have settled for the few democratic concessions the military has made. A year after the start of the revolution, the way forward is less clear than ever.
While the Egyptian protesters won the battle but seem to be losing the war, the Occupy movement’s loss of the first battle does not necessarily portend the end of the movement. Instead, we are beginning to recognize that while spatial occupation is an effective tool, it is not the end game. The pursuit of structural, social, and economic reform does not necessarily depend on the occupation of physical space, and the events in Egypt shows us that this occupation is not necessarily enough to create the change we seek. What next for Occupy?
The decision of many of the major Occupy Movements not to re-occupy public space has freed up a great deal of energy and creativity that is being directed to other outlets—the encampments themselves needed a great deal of physical work and commitment, as they often housed everything from soup kitchens to libraries to medical clinics.
Today, Occupy activists are engaging in many activities that are not directly tied to physical space, such as confronting finance firms whom the government has refused to prosecute (Occupy Harvard has done this) or leading marches demanding an end to sexual harassment and rape culture, as Occupy vigilantes have been doing in Allston. These actions have been accompanied by a proliferation of caucuses and working groups localizing the Occupy movement (Occupy Allston-Brighton has recently surfaced, for example) and allowing activists to focus on specific tasks. Occupy Harvard has developed working groups on internal issues (like anti-oppression and inter-Occupy solidarity) as well as on external issues (Muckraking Harvard and Animal Rights). In this way, the efforts of activists are channeled in a number of diverse but well-coordinated directions that allow for a multifaceted movement confronting inequality and oppression at multiple levels.
Additionally, Occupy has begun occupying different kinds of spaces. Recently, students at the University of Massachusetts Boston, the city’s only public university, occupied the lobby of their student union with many of the same demands as Harvard and other University occupiers. This action is similar to the ongoing indoor occupation of an Istanbul Starbucks, moves to indoor occupations in Washington,  D.C., and, of course, the Occupy Harvard occupation of Lamont Library.
Similar to the work of Ocupemos El Barrio and other anti-foreclosure movements, Occupy D.C. activists are occupying foreclosed properties to help prevent families from getting kicked out of their homes. The combination of occupation and anti-foreclosure activism represents a profound move forward in the fight for the 99 percent that physically defends homes and livelihoods from predatory banks.
Despite a perceived lull in the Occupy movement, this winter has still witnessed the greatest degree of activism that we’ve seen in this country for forty years. Although the movement has been slowed by winter and government repression, the present is a vital moment of movement building and reorganizing that will allow Occupy to emerge more powerful and focused in the spring.  To those who think that this revolutionary movement will duck its head and go away, think again—Occupy is here to stay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Harvard community received a rather frustrating email in response to concerns about the restructuring of the library system from University President Drew G. Faust. After Faust’s email came an equally dissatisfying email from University Provost Alan M. Garber. As someone who cares deeply about the future of both Harvard University Library and its employees, working closely with many talented librarians in Widener’s Stacks Division since 2009, these emails struck me as too little, too late.
The lack of transparency in the proposed restructuring of the library system—seemingly consisting of layoffs and an “incentivized” early retirement program affecting an undisclosed number of HUL employees—has every library employee on edge. This situation has attracted the attention of students and community members at Harvard, and even Cambridge at large. Although the Harvard community clearly would like to know more about this, the University’s best efforts seem intended to keep us in the dark. It seems as if the University prefers to sweep this dirty business under the rug, and with it the livelihoods of many of its most dedicated employees, rather than honestly answer pertinent and necessary questions about the library restructuring.
President Faust and Provost Garber's emails mainly ignore the concerns of Library staff as to the status of their jobs. Instead, the emails relate vague plans to spend a larger percentage of the library's budget on new acquisitions and upgraded technology. Some of these are great ideas, including a more centralized access policy, a more centrally coordinated collection development procedure to avoid superfluous acquisitions, and a thoughtful and redoubled digital acquisitions policy for the voyage into what Faust breathlessly terms “an exciting yet uncharted new world of digital information.” But how, logically, do these changes connote a mass reduction in staff?
Implied yet never explicitly stated is the idea that the University would only be able to afford these changes by spending radically less on staff. Instead of just out and saying that “library transition” means “pink slips,” though, President Faust slyly implies this when she says that the portion of HUL's budget allocated to the payroll is excessive: "Only 29 percent of Harvard's total library budget goes to materials, while for our peers, the average is 41 percent." But President Faust never makes clear what constitutes a peer—after all, the average holdings of the other Ivy League libraries was 7,304,694 volumes in 2009, less than half of Harvard’s 16,557,002 volumes that year, according to the Association of Research Libraries. Furthermore, most of these “peer” libraries cannot be counted among the very best research libraries in the world. Harvard is in the privileged position of holding many unique and irreplaceable collections, developed by librarians and faculty over centuries and lovingly curated today by the people who know them best. Firing these librarians to restore “balance” to the budget would be a Pyrrhic victory.
Two days following Faust’s email, the Provost of the University, Alan M. Garber, sent out his own essay on the subject. Garber’s description of the coming restructuring of the Library mentions new endeavors varying from achievable goals to hopeless pipe dreams: a “robust library portal (expected to launch this year)” which would hopefully correct the many faults of the Hollis system and could be truly beneficial, nebulous “affinity groups” joining staff between different libraries and creating a bureaucratic mess, and CVS-style self-checkout, presumably as an alternative to paying so many librarians.
Once circulation is handled by robots, who will help confused scholars locate library materials when Hollis searches turn up, as they so often do, with misleading results? Who will introduce students to resources that can not only bolster the pedigree of their papers and problem sets but also lead them to think more critically about their work and to ask questions they wouldn’t have asked otherwise?
Near the end of his long email, Garber finally mentions the repercussions of these reforms on employees of the library: “We recognize that members of the talented library staff are anxious to see how the transition will affect them as individuals, and we are confident that our new strategic direction will ultimately produce gratifying new responsibilities and career development opportunities.” This strikes me as a rather carefully worded way of saying that many of HUL’s employees will either have to work harder in increasingly understaffed libraries (the first round of cuts in 2009 having already left many divisions of Harvard’s library incredibly sparse) or will be “developing their careers” by searching for new jobs.
If HUL is, as Faust writes, “the University’s circulatory system,” the librarians are its heart. An evolving Harvard University Library that preserves its reputation of excellence is possible, but not if the University insists on continually diminishing its workforce. The administration, in choosing opacity and doublespeak over honesty and open conversation has rendered the library staff fearful for their careers and the Harvard community fearful for its librarians. These official statements are simply not enough; the librarians themselves, along with everyone who uses the libraries, deserve clarity. We deserve to know what the restructuring of the library system entails, and how that will affect those valuable members of our community who devote themselves to helping us be better scholars, performing the true function of a University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, Massachusetts seems poised to vote into office yet another member of the prominent Kennedy clan.
 
 Joseph P. Kennedy III, grandson of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy ’48 and Democratic frontrunner for the 2012 Massachusetts Fourth District Congressional race, boasts a progressive political platform typical of politicians that hail from his family. Among Kennedy’s campaign promises is a tax code that benefits lower- and middle-class Americans and a sustainable energy policy; this is an agenda that is no doubt favorable to liberal voters, including the better part of Harvard’s undergraduate population. But perhaps most significantly, the thirty-one-year-old candidate’s rapid political ascendancy is indicative of the troubling hegemony held by the Kennedy family in local and even national politics.  
 
 That one family has exercised such enormous political clout in the state of Massachusetts for over half a century seems inconsistent with American political values. The United States, a liberal democracy and a quintessentially meritocratic nation predicated on individual achievement, should possess a political culture in which bright, capable individuals from modest backgrounds are as likely to be elected to public office as individuals from politically and economically distinguished families. Yet six members of the Kennedy family have held high political offices in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including former President John F. Kennedy ’40 and former Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’56. Many others have occupied notable (if less prominent) offices, such as former Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, Joseph P. Kennedy III’s father.  
 
 So influential are the Kennedys that they are sometimes referred to as “America’s royal family,” the obvious implication being that they are not held to the standards of other Americans and not expected to achieve prominence solely on the basis of their personal capabilities. That the young and inexperienced Joseph P. Kennedy III can be considered a serious political contender is a clear indicator that our supposed meritocracy is not functioning as it should.  
 
 Unfortunately, the instance of the Kennedys is not anomalous. Indeed, the entrenchment of this particularly renowned dynasty is only one example of the way in which influential families can maintain power in the American political system. Joseph P. Kennedy III has undoubtedly also benefited from the undue influence that money and wealth have in modern American politics. For liberal Democratic voters, who should favor a more egalitarian and meritocratic political culture without such a high spending barrier obstructing entry, this latest Kennedy’s rapid rise ought to seem especially problematic. By so fervently embracing yet another Kennedy, liberal Democrats perpetuate a culture that they, and we, oppose. 
 
 Of course, the Kennedy family has contributed much to both American and Massachusetts politics in the last half-century. President John F. Kennedy ‘40 and Robert F. Kennedy ‘48 both helped facilitate the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and campaigned for racial equality in America. In addition, the Kennedy family includes a large number of influential environmental and human rights activists. With all else equal, Joseph P. Kennedy III may follow in this illustrious tradition and indeed prove himself an admirable and effective Democratic Party leader. 
 
 Nonetheless, Kennedy should not win an election simply of the basis of his last name. As a fairly young and inexperienced candidate, it seems likely that he has cultivated Democratic Party favor primarily on the basis of his family connections and the strong legacy of his surname. Continuing to support blindly the Kennedy family simply on the basis of historical precedent is bad politics and harmful to the integrity of American democracy.

During the first five months of her campaign for U.S. Senate, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren received over $100,000 in donations from Harvard employees—the largest sum any Senate candidate has received from individuals on the Harvard payroll in the past decade.
According to documents made available online by the Federal Election Commission last week, 110 employees—the majority of whom are professors—combined to donate $102,185 through the end of 2011. Warren received nearly ten times the amount that Harvard employees donated to her opponent Sen. Scott Brown.
Though Warren drew contributions from across the University, the Democrat received the strongest support from the Law School, where she has taught for nearly 20 years.
FEC documents showed that 47 Law School professors donated $62,950 to their colleague in the first few months of her campaign. The donor pool represents roughly 16 percent of the Law School faculty.
That the Law School is supporting Warren so significantly is little surprise to many professors there. Professors said that Warren is a well-respected academic and colleague who many at the school are excited to support, some in spite of politics.
“There’s great enthusiasm for Elizabeth Warren’s campaign across the political spectrum among professors (and students and staff) here at the Law School,” Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 wrote in an email. “Everyone I know finds her enormously intelligent and down-to-earth and is greatly impressed by her vision for the state and the country as well as by her amazing energy and effectiveness as a candidate.”
As Warren has found backers among her peers at Harvard, some have wondered whether her affiliation with the University has pressured professors and students into supporting her.
But professors said that their hand was not forced when making donations to the Warren campaign.
“There has not been an ounce of pressure to do anything,” said Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree.
“I don’t think there is any expectation that professors should help out, but there’s an enormous desire to do so not just as a favor to a colleague but as a genuine public service,” Tribe wrote.
In addition to offering personal contributions, several of Warren’s colleagues have served as informal fundraisers for the campaign, hosting fundraising parties at their homes or tapping potential donors from outside of the Harvard community.
Ogletree said that he and Tribe are among a half dozen or so Law School professors—who have long admired and worked closely with Warren—leading the charge on Warren’s behalf.
Tribe, who has worked closely with Warren for years and helped recruit Warren to the Law School, personally donated $5000 to the campaign in 2011. In addition, Tribe hosted approximately 85 guests at a fundraising party for Warren at his home in December.
Warren’s friend and colleague Jody Freeman, a professor at the Law School, donated $1,000 to the campaign. Freeman appeared beside the Senate candidate’s husband, Law School professor Bruce H. Mann, at an “HLS for Elizabeth Warren” event in January.
Law School professors said they expect fundraising efforts there to increase in coming months as classes let out for summer recess and professors have more free time.
The FEC numbers only represent individual itemized contributions made by donors who reported working at Harvard. The majority of donations were made after Warren officially declared her candidacy in September.
University policy prohibits institutional endorsement of a candidate, but Warren has received large donations from several notable faculty members, including former University President Derek C. Bok and professor Charles E. Rosenberg, the husband of University President Drew G. Faust. They gave $2000 and $2500, respectively.
In the 2010 special election for Senate, Harvard employees contributed roughly $54,000 to Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley during her campaign for U.S. Senate against Scott Brown. Brown received $11,350 in itemized contributions from Harvard employees during that election cycle.
The race between Warren and Brown is anticipated to be one of the most expensive in the country. Warren outraised Brown in the final two quarters of 2011 overall, but Brown remains ahead in the cash race due to funds leftover from the 2010 election.
The Warren campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the Harvard employee’s fiduciary support for the candidate.

The first planet outside of our solar system that is largely composed of liquid water has been discovered by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
The new planet, named GJ1214b, was discovered in 2009 by Zachory K. Berta, a graduate student in Astrophysics, and his thesis adviser David Charbonneau, an astronomy professor.
But Berta and his colleagues only recently confirmed the planet’s classification as a “water world”—a reference to the 1995 Kevin Costner film—after analyzing observations taken by the Hubble Space Telescope’s last shuttle trip.
“It’s been sort of a long process,” Berta said. “We had some hints that we might be dealing with a planet that had a very large fraction of water in it but we couldn’t confirm it at the time,” Berta said.
Researchers determined the planet’s composition based on the distortion of light picked up by the Hubble Space Telescope during the planet’s transit of the red dwarf star it orbits.
The planet, which is 40 million light years away from earth, has a diameter about 2.7 times that of earth.
“It’s absolutely very satisfying to finish a very long analysis,” Berta said. “The biggest emotional moment was realizing that things were going to work.”
Looking ahead, Berta said there are two main areas for future research. The first is to continue observing GJ1214b in more detail using the methods of the Hubble’s most recent trip in order to learn more about the planet’s composition.
Second, Berta said researchers must work to find more planets like GJ1214b, develop a population of observations for water-based planets, and then study these planets’ atmospheres.
“If you can study the atmosphere, then you can start to piece together the sort of biochemistry occurring on the planet,” Berta said. “You could start to tell if the planet has the conditions for life or actually has life.”
Joshua N. Winn, a physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the recent discovery, said the classification of the planet will have important implications in the search for extraterrestrial life.
“I think it’s very exciting, and the reason is because a long term goal in this field is to eventually be able to study planets like the Earth,” Winn said. “This study takes us along that way because this is the first study of observing a small planet, not a large one like Jupiter.”
Berta’s research will be published in the March 2012 edition of The Astrophysical Journal.

The Science Center Plaza is scheduled to undergo surface-level refurbishments in the coming months to enhance the safety and quality of pedestrian and bike access and provide more outdoor seating areas.
The initial stages of this project, which is a joint effort between Harvard and the City of Cambridge, will commence in the coming weeks and continue through May. This week, several prototype benches are being placed in the plaza south of the ice skating rink.
The plaza renovations grew out of a larger effort this year to make improvements to the Cambridge Street Tunnel. The tunnel, built in the 1960s, will undergo a range of structural repairs and infrastructure improvements as part of the Cambridge Street Tunnel Infrastructure and Surface Improvements Project.
As part of this project, the sidewalks between Quincy Street and the Johnston Gate will be rebuilt and utilities will be upgraded.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal said that the University welcomes the opportunity presented by the tunnel renovations to enact improvements to the public space between the Yard and the Science Center.
The project website notes that developers aim to “maintain an open space area that can be enjoyed by the community” through the renovations.
A number of outdoor performances and events have been hosted in the plaza since it was brought under the umbrella of Harvard Common Spaces Program last fall. Ongoing activities, including the temporary ice rink and food truck vendors, will continue throughout repairs.
Student input is being considered in the planning and design of the plaza.
“We are working to incorporate student feedback [on] how they would like to see the space used and on a number of potential design elements,” said Neal.
“I would be in support of expanding that space to accommodate more people. People tend to congregate in that area anyway,” said Jason C. Sarte ’12.
“It would be nice to make it a social center,” Sarte added.
The construction team is working to minimize disruption and plans to maintain pedestrian and bike access through the Plaza during the construction period.
“It’s good for the students. Who would be against it?” said Aida R. Ruiz ’13.

Akio Kawakami has retracted three articles that he published during his time as a medical researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health.
School of Public Health professor Frank M. Sacks co-authored all three of the articles, and one of the articles was also written by Harvard Medical School professor Peter Libby.
The articles were published in American Heart Association (AHA) journals in 2008 and 2010. Kawakami worked as a researcher at Harvard from April 2004 to March 2006, leaving for a position in the department of Geriatrics and Vascular Medicine at Tokyo Medical and Dental University.
Kawakami came forward in Dec. 2011 to request the retraction of the papers, according to a statement released by Julie F. Rafferty, a School of Public Health spokesperson.
“Dr. Kawakami informed colleagues at HSPH and Brigham and Women’s Hospital that there were concerns related to the accuracy and authenticity of the research data he had produced,” Rafferty wrote in the statement.
Questions of accuracy, instances of improper data presentation, and “negligence in keeping proper original records” were among several problems with the three articles, according to retraction notices posted on the AHA website.
“Because the number of experiments was inflated in some studies, and the corresponding author presented some data from unrelated experiments, the results are not verifiable,” the Notice of Retraction read for Kawakami’s 2010 article published in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology.
The School of Public Health is conducting an inquiry into the Kawakami articles, Sacks wrote in an email to the Crimson. Sacks declined to comment further on the three articles he co-authored with Kawakami.
The AHA retractions indicate that Kawakami assumed full responsibility for the problems related to the articles when he came forward in December.
“All co-authors involved in this study other than the corresponding author had no knowledge of any scientific impropriety related to the collection, analysis, or presentation of data in this article,” stated the retraction notice for a 2008 article published in Circulation Research. “Dr. Kawakami apologizes for any adverse consequences that may have resulted from the article’s publication.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Committee on Student Life meeting Thursday morning, College administrators and House Masters discussed an initiative proposed by the Institute of Politics Tobacco Control Policy Group that would develop and implement a University-wide smoke-free policy.
Members of the policy group—which consists of five undergraduates and their adviser Mackenzie J. Lowry ’11—have presented their proposal to a number of student life groups beginning last semester.
Lowry, who serves as a freshman proctor in Wigglesworth, said that the group hopes the University will gradually institute a campus-wide smoke-free policy in 2012. The group suggested that Harvard impose the ban on Harvard Yard before extending the policy to cover the rest of campus.
“The reason we’re focusing first and foremost on Harvard Yard, is because—as Occupy Harvard really highlighted—Harvard Yard is very symbolic of Harvard University as a whole,” Lowry said. “It really represents the heart of Harvard.”
Lowry added that she thinks a smoking ban is important because smoking is a serious public health issue.
The House Masters at the meeting agreed that the College should move toward being a smoke-free environment. They expressed a preference for a common policy on campus as opposed to different policies for each of the Houses and the Yard.
Lowry said that she hopes the potential plan would encourage Harvard affiliates to quit smoking.
“Suppose the policy is announced in May," Lowry said. “It will take a few months to go into effect. During that time, people will be given enough time to seek out Harvard’s fantastic cessation resources in anticipation of adjusting to a smoke-free environment.”
The Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services provides Harvard students looking to quit smoking with “individual consultations, literature, referrals, and free quit kits,” according to its website.
For Harvard staff, Harvard University Health Services waives the co-pay for visits to a tobacco treatment specialist, Lowry said.
Harvard’s Longwood Medical campus, home to the Harvard Medical School and the School of Public Health, has been smoke-free since Mar. 2009. The Harvard Kennedy School recently announced that it will become a smoke-free campus on Mar. 1, 2012.
At the meeting, Committee members also discussed updates on the drafting of a new, comprehensive College-wide alcohol policy. The new policy will respond to student input gathered from an Office of Student Life online forum that was created earlier this month.
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said that once student comments have been summarized, the alcohol policy committee will hold additional meetings in each residential neighborhood and the Yard to present “the alcohol policy and rationale for the Committee’s recommendations.”
For its final topic, the Committee discussed the resources available for students who become pregnant. Director of the Harvard College Women’s Center Gina Helfrich explained the resources available to pregnant students on campus.
Helfrich said that she used feedback from UHS to create a new brochure that outlines women’s on-campus options for responding to pregnancy. Helfrich said that an online version will be available on the Women’s Center website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers will form three “joint councils” with Harvard Library management to negotiate the library system’s reorganization, according to a University spokesperson.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that union leadership proposed the formation of the councils late last week in an effort to improve communication between HUCTW and the University.
“We’ve been frustrated that there wasn’t more serious discussion going on about some of the crucial transition details and that there wasn’t better opportunity for our members to participate in thinking about how to build a greater library,” Jaeger said.
The reorganization has been a point of contention between the University and library workers since Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton announced on Jan. 19 that the library workforce would be trimmed down as the University moves forward with restructuring its library system.
A University spokesperson said that the three councils will be formed in accordance with the union’s contract with the University and will meet regularly starting in early March and through June 2012.
Joint councils will be formed to represent the Access Services, Technical Services, and Preservation and Digital Services departments, Jaeger said. The councils will be comprised of eight to ten people with equal numbers of union and Harvard Library representatives.
In addition, Jaeger said that HUCTW is currently working on an “open letter” that will be circulated through the Harvard community next week to garner sympathy for the union.
“We think that if faculty and students can see as our members see...they’re going to be concerned about deteriorating quality in the current library,” Jaeger said.
The letter will discuss the union’s concerns that the libraries are already understaffed and that outsourcing of services such as cataloguing might weaken the library system, Jaeger said.
“We want to pay particular attention to the question of what are the minimum staffing levels needed to have a great library,” Jaeger said. “We think that our community is very much in danger of not really having a world-class library.”
On Wednesday, HUCTW leadership sent an email to inform its members of the formation of the joint councils. Library assistant Karen L. O’Brien, a HUCTW representative, expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the councils, saying that the University has provided the union few details thus far.
O’Brien said that despite numerous attempts from workers to give input to the reorganization, the University has been nonresponsive and “close-mouthed.”
Jeffrey W. Booth, also a library assistant and HUCTW member, said the councils would do nothing to mitigate the threat of layoffs, calling it a “regressive step.”
“They’re extremely ineffectual and often only take up minor issues,” Booth said. “I’m sure Harvard management is so happy.”
Booth, dissatisfied with the formation of councils, said that his union needs to respond more visibly to the University’s recent announcement. He suggested that the union conduct inclusive, membership-wide meetings that could lead to a strike vote, a large rally, or a sit-in of Massachusetts Hall.
“It feels like David and Goliath...but if David didn’t have a slingshot,” Booth said. “The union leadership is not arming the membership.”
Jaeger said that while HUCTW’s ultimate goal is to build a great library, the union is also striving to improve relations between workers and library management.
“We’d like to rebuild some trust and build some better relationships between union members and the key management leaders of the transition,” Jaeger said. “I think a lot of our members are quite deeply frustrated, and union leaders are as well. The state of the library workplace at this point, as far as we can tell, is basically chaos and demoralized disarray.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Letting a scholar loose in your library is like letting a child loose in a candy store with a thousand dollar bill,” a researcher once told a librarian at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine. As one of the world’s largest collections of rare books, artwork, artifacts, and specimens documenting the evolution of medicine, Countway is one of Harvard Medical School’s hidden gems and a valuable resource for the Boston academic community at large.
Only a 20-minute bus ride from Harvard Square, the library houses a treasure trove of some of the world’s most famous medical texts and anatomical specimens. Over the past several months, Harvard College’s Office of the Senior Associate Provost and the Harvard Library Strategic Conversations program have been hosting a series of presentations focusing on specific artifacts available around the university called  “A History of Objects.” Countway is among the libraries featured.
Countway, founded in 1965, ranks as one of the largest medical libraries in the world. It serves as a resource for students, faculty, and residents of the greater Boston area and is a major asset to the Harvard Medical School, Harvard Dental School, and Harvard School of Public Health. The library also houses the Warren Anatomical Museum, and the HMS medical museum.
Over the years, Countway has contributed much to the inquisitive medical minds that venture forth in the name of discovery and understanding. The library–which showcases prime medical artifacts and houses texts both ancient and electronic—is a link between America’s oldest medical traditions and cutting-edge literature.
SPECIMENS & ARTIFACTS
The Warren Anatomical Museum has grown from its humble beginnings in 1847 as the personal teaching collection of renowned Harvard surgeon John Collins Warren to an assortment of over 15,000 items. The large collection comes as both a blessing and a burden, according to Countway Public Services Librarian Jack Eckert.
“Most of the collection isn’t on display because we don’t have exhibit areas,” he said. “We tend to rotate exhibits a couple of times a year, generally with some kind of thematic idea”.
The Museum’s most famous pieces are on display for the public’s enjoyment year-round at the Warren Anatomical Exhibit. One such specimen is the skull of Phineas Gage, an American railroad construction foreman who survived an accident in which a large iron rod passed through and destroyed much of his frontal lobe. His case study was momentous in elucidating the importance of the frontal lobe in shaping human personality and behavior.
“We definitely have a lot of articles written on the Phineas Gage skull,” said Elizabeth Eggleston, Director of Collections and Management Knowledge at the Countway Library of Medicine. “We are also lucky to have a daguerreotype of what we believe is Phineas Gage with that rod.”
Although the museum is most famous for this specimen, the library also houses a variety of other artifacts, including a letter signed by Thomas Jefferson and photographs of President James A. Garfield’s vertebrae.
“I’m particularly fond of the radiographic prints of [Russian Tsar] Nicholas and [his wife] Alexandra done in 1898,” said Eckert.  “To me they’re particularly beautiful and evocative images, especially when you think about what happened to these people.”
Though Countway currently has limited opportunities for students to interact with these precious artifacts, the librarians hope this will change in the coming years.
“This is meant as a teaching collection, and the hope is that as time goes on and the library is able to develop the collection, more students will be able to be involved,” said Eggleston.
A RICH HISTORY
From its inception, the Countway Library has collected and preserved the texts of Boston’s medical community. Created as a merger of the Boston Medical Library and the Harvard Medical Library, Countway benefits greatly from its diverse benefactors.
“During the 19th and most of the 20th century, those two libraries were building competing collections and had somewhat different areas of interest,” said Eckert. “When Countway opened, it cared for the historic materials from both libraries, and that is what we still do.”
Among Countway’s resources are medical incunabula, reports, and publications. The rich collection of texts span diverse subject areas of anatomy, gynecology and obstetrics, radiology, medical jurisprudence, surgery, psychology, phrenology, medical botany, pharmacy and pharmacology, and internal medicine.
“A lot of the book collections are interesting; there is some 19th century literature on medical treatments written at a time when medicine was becoming much more scientific,” said Eggleston. “You can see the early attempts at treatments are all there”.
OTHER RESOURCES
Digital presentations of the artifacts available at Countway and other Harvard libraries are available online. Current uploaded videos include a presentation on one of the books that survived the Harvard Fire and was digitized as part of the Medical Heritage Library project. Another showcase recently found photos of soldiers’ lungs from the Fort Devens 1918 flu outbreak.
These presentations showcase the wide variety of specimens, but also provide tutorials on the electronic resources available at Countway.
“There is so much there that nobody knows about because it is a huge amount of information available for anybody to use,” said David Osterbur, Director of Public and Access Services at the Countway Library. “We have a variety of classes available to learn how to use these resources available to anyone interested.”
Countway holds more than 3,500 current journal titles, 630,000 volumes, and provides access to electronic catalogs.
The medical library even offers some non-conventional therapeutic resources.
“While most undergraduates have probably never heard of Countway, it definitely has some unique experiences to offer,” said Sarvagna Patel ’12. “For example, you can rent Cooper, a shi-tzu puppy, to play with and de-stress from a hectic week. Good luck trying to find that in Lamont!”

A group of researchers advised by Harvard scientists has created an implant which can be electrically stimulated to release drug doses through a specially designed microchip, lessening the hassle of treatment for patients requiring daily injections.
The implant, which could accommodate 20 drug doses, was inserted under the skin of the waist of eight women afflicted with osteoporosis, a disease that reduces bone mineral density.
Harvard Medical School professor Robert M. Neer, who advised researchers in the process of creating the implant, said that it took nearly a decade to safely seal the drug in a single dose reservoir.
“The company went to extraordinary lengths to make sure that all the reservoirs would not empty simultaneously,” Neer said.
Researchers monitored blood markers to determine how effectively the implant dispensed Teriparatide, a commercially manufactured form of the parathyroid hormone which increases the amount of calcium in the blood and promotes bone formation. According to  the study published in Science Tranlational Medicine this month, they found that the drug was delivered as effectively through the implant as through injections.
Robert Farra, President and Chief Operating Officer of MicroCHIPS, Inc., the private company that funded this study, said that they carefully monitored the chemical activity of both the implant and the Teriparatide injection and then compared the results.
“We found that the implant had a similar therapeutic efficacy as the subcutaneous injection,” Farra said. “There was also less variation in the pharmacokinetic parameters of different doses with the implant.”
Researchers also checked that the device could be filled with appropriate dosages, that the drug could be released within a specified time frame, and that it could stay stable at body temperature.
After conducting preliminary trials on dogs, researchers made significant changes to the device design in order to be cleared for human clinical trials.
During the human trials, patients did not experience any infections or complications due to the implant, and many said that they could not even feel its presence.
“Right after we implanted the device, patients were able to get up and walk out,” Farra said.
Currently, scientists are working on designing a device that can administer 365 doses, enough to last for a year. Researchers are also considering the possibility of using the implant for patients with other diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
“The day-to-day routine that patients go through is difficult and becomes a hardship that they are burdened with,” said Farra. “This technology truly allows patients to no longer worry about their disease.”

Mary M. Griffin ’13 does independent research in a biomechanics lab, but lab is far from lonely. Her research is made more enjoyable by the fact that she works with small, furry little rodents called jerboas.
“They’re adorable,” she said. “Harvard has only the second breeding population of jerboas in the world. They are very hard to breed in captivity because they have very specific breeding habits.”
In Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Andrew A. Biewener’s lab, Griffin studies the techniques that jerboas use to stabilize their vision fields. Most mammals have some sort of mechanism through which they can stabilize their vision fields so that they can run or jump without getting disoriented. Rabbits and hares have intracranial joints that move to stabilize their sight, chickens can maintain their head positions even when their bodies are rotating, and humans can look at a fixed point space even while shaking their heads through a process called oculovestibular stabilization. But jerboas use none of these methods.
“Jerboas are somewhat of an enigma,” she said.
Griffin, under the supervision of OEB graduate student Talia Y. Moore, is trying to understand the jerboa’s strategies for stabilization. In lab, Griffin observes the small rodents as they run through a tunnel and captures their movements using two x-ray cameras. Next, she uploads the data to her computer and analyzes the relative positions of the different parts of a jerboa’s body using the computer software MatLab.
“I like becoming proficient at handling different kinds of technology like x-ray cameras and MatLab,” she said.
Griffin started working in the lab last semester, and became more involved this semester when her supervised research began to count for OEB degree credit.
“I am pre-med, so I knew that I wanted to get some lab experience, but I also wanted to do something that involved hands-on experience,” Griffin said. “I’ve never been interested in the idea of sitting in a lab and growing cultures or pipetting.”
She was especially attracted to doing research in a relatively new field.
“Biomechanics is a new field [and] not much research has been done on it, but it is really exciting,” she said. “It is a very unique area of research and I am happy that I got involved in it. It is different; how many people here do biomechanics research?”
Griffin added that biomechanics is important because it provides the information used in a lot of robotics research. But even though Griffin enjoys working in the field, she does not plan to continue with this work after graduating. Instead, she plans to go to medical school.
“The study of biomechanics has really hooked me and I am really interested in it right now,” Griffin said. “Now I know that going into research can be very rewarding ... still, I do not want my career to be research focused.”
Griffin spends quite a lot of time in the lab, including a commute to Concord Field Station, where she sometimes stays from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. But she said that she does not mind the extra travel or the extra hours.
“I thought that working in the lab would be just another thing that I did but it has become one of the highlights of my experience here,” she said.

Former Harvard provost Steven E. Hyman will now serve as director for the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, an entity under the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, combining his leadership experience with his passion and success in neurobiology. In the coming years, he said his aim is to increase collaboration and innovation at the Center.
“Research on treatment for the common forms of serious mental disorders ... is really at a standstill, and the opportunity here is the strength of the genetics programs that typify what the Broad is about,” Hyman said.
The Stanley Center—created in 2007 with the help of a grant to the Broad Institute—aims to combine approaches from the fields of chemical biology and genetics to better understand schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses.
Prior to becoming director of the Center, Hyman served as director of the National Institute of Mental Health in the 1990s, which helped fuel his interest in the problems posed by serious mental illnesses.
Subsequently, he served as Harvard University provost for 10 years. While provost, Hyman stayed active in the field of neuroscience and psychiatric disease by keeping up to date with literature and serving on committees on the genetics behind mental disorders. Hyman also consistently taught undergraduate courses in neurobiology.
He has been guest lecturing at Harvard Medical School and plans to return to teach an undergraduate course at the College next year.
Hyman will replace former director Edward M. Scolnick ’61, who helped found the Center. As director, Scolnick helped raise money for the Center and guided the scientists, forging strategies for the program.
The Broad Institute conducted an international search for a new director after Scolnick decided to step down. Hyman had been on sabbatical at the Broad for the past six months.
“We’re counting on his leadership for the Stanley Center,” said Eric S. Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute.
“Real wonderful leaders still have the fire in the belly to keep pressing the frontiers. We couldn’t be luckier to have him,” he added.
Steven McCarroll, director of genetics at the Stanley Center and an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, said Hyman’s ability to think in an integrated way about genetics, neurobiology, and clinical psychiatry will serve him well in his new role.
“There are few people in the world who can master the ability to think in an integrated way about these and that’s exactly what you would want,” McCarroll said.
Hyman is also looking to get more members of the Harvard community—faculty, graduates and undergraduates—involved at the Stanley Center, including those at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department, as they begin to develop stem cell models.
Hyman’s current projects include working with colleagues at the Center to devise strategies on how to move from genetic determination to broader biological studies, including exploring computational modeling for the research.
“[The] coming challenge is how to take the emerging genetic information and turn it into biological experiments that help explain these,” Hyman said.
Hyman also noted the abandonment of the study of brain disorders by the biotechnology industry and hopes that he can help to promote that field of research .
“I think if we in academia can begin to make some headway it will attract back some of the players who could translate these discoveries into treatments,” Hyman said.

Researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute have developed a nanobot that may allow for the detection and destruction of cancer cells. The nanobot will target and attach to cancerous cells, delivering a payload of antibodies that combat the disease’s spread.
The researchers, led by George Church, Ido Bachelet, and Shawn Douglas, utilized cutting-edge techniques to develop the nanobots, guide their attachment to cancer cells, and trigger the deployment of the antibodies.
According to Douglas, one of the researchers’ most significant achievements is the streamlined assembly and delivery process developed for the nanobot.
The efficiency of the process is due in large part to the barrel-like shape of the nanobot, which allows for many fewer opportunities for error than earlier box-shaped designs.
“If you make something with a lid that has to close and open again later, that’s another step—you have to assemble it open, or assemble it closed and then open it,” said Douglas.’
“And if you have to close it and open it again under different conditions, that’s a more complicated process to solve,” he added.
Though an open barrel may seem more likely to release its payload off-target, in-vitro trials with human cells have shown that the nanobots assemble correctly 97 percent of the time with no incidents of the payload deploying prematurely.
This concern is particularly important, since the consequences of the nanobots’ payload consistently reaching the wrong target could be deadly. In the case of cancer, where infected cells can be very similar to healthy cells, it becomes even more difficult to ensure that the nanobots’ deploy their payload correctly.
According to Naomi Genuth ’14, a student conducting related research, the authors were able to achieve such positive results by designing the nanobots to target proteins present on the surface of the cell rather than the DNA or RNA contained within.
“Previously,” said Genuth, “they were using DNA or RNA, which is not present on cell surfaces.”
To date, the nanobots have only been tested on human cells in-vitro.
But according to Douglas, rodent testing will soon be underway, paving the road for clinical trials further in the future.
The most immediate issue with the nanobots’ practicality as a treatment is the time it takes for them to locate and bind to their targets.
“We have to give them a few hours at least,” said Douglas.
Additionally, the harsh environment of the bloodstream may result in the destruction of nanobots before they can deploy their payload.
Nevertheless, the researchers are hopeful about the prospects of the nanobots.
“It’s groundbreaking—not only because it’s working with a very new field and very new technologies, but also because it is improving on these technologies and expanding the capabilities of what researchers in the future will be able to do with them,” said Genuth.

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have completed a whole-genome sequencing of the E. coli bacterial strains responsible for the deadly 2011 outbreaks in Germany and France.
The outbreaks, which killed 50 people, were traced to two sources of sprouts in Germany contaminated with particularly virulent strains of E. coli.
The study, which will appear in the journal “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,” found genetic variations between the German and French strains that had been previously undetectable using traditional sequencing tools. Whole genome sequencing allowed the researchers to precisely discriminate among strains at the nucleotide level.
“By applying this approach to this outbreak, and even more to outbreaks in the future as it becomes routine, we’re going to be able to pick [apart] the detailed patterns of transmission,” said senior author William P. Hanage, an epidemiology professor at HSPH. “And if we can figure out how things are transmitted around, then we’re going to be able to intervene to stop them.”
Harvard Medical School professor of pediatrics Clifford W. Lo, who was not affiliated with the study, added that “this was a new strain that was causing this disease, and it was tracked down in record time.”
Usually, more genetically diverse bacterial strains are correlated with a larger infected human population, but in this case, all the strains connected to the larger German outbreak were found to have nearly identical genomes while the genomes of E. coli strains in France showed greater diversity.
In this context, diversity refers to a high number of differences in the genetic coding between strains of one bacterial species.
“The surprising finding was that there is a difference in [genetic] diversity between the [French and German] outbreaks,” said Yonatan H. Grad, a researcher involved in the study. “In the German strain there was very little diversity, but in the much smaller French outbreak there was considerably more.”
Explanations proposed by the authors including the possibility that there was more original genetic diversity in the French E. coli strains, that there were differences in mutation rates between German and French strains, and that the German strain underwent a population bottleneck effect—a phenomenon in which an evolutionarily less fit portion of the E. coli population was killed or otherwise prevented from reproducing.
Biochemical bacterial typing—currently the standard procedure for bacterial identification—can take several days, but it is nevertheless faster than whole-genome sequencing. However, Lo predicts that with improvements in technology, the high-resolution methods used in this study will be used more extensively in the future.
“I don’t think that genomic sequencing will prevent death once an outbreak happens,” he said. “But it could be used ... to find out what the bug is doing and where it came from.”

Michael Isaac Parzen is a Senior Lecturer on Statistics in the Harvard University Statistics Department. Parzen is currently researching statistical methods relating to non-standard regression, resampling, and computational statistics amongst other fields. Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics” and Statistics 107: “Introduction to Business and Financial Statistics,” both taught by Parzen, are two of the most popular courses offered at Harvard College.
The Harvard Crimson: You tell your students that Statistics is the new “sexy” field. Why do you think that is the case?
Michael Isaac Parzen: Everyone wants to be in the field that’s “sexy,” so statisticians rejoiced when the New York Times printed that we are now “sexy” [written in an article by Google economist Hal Varian]. I think there is a preponderance of data now with Facebook, Google, and texting [and] I think that as people get more and more in touch with technology they realize how much data they’re using and how much data they’re producing on a daily basis, and they want to be able to understand it, manipulate it.
THC: How do you keep students engaged throughout your lectures?
MIP: It’s tough. There is no magic table of contents ... The only way to engage the students is to have hopefully interesting examples and have lots of energy in class … Let’s pretend this is a 30 person class so everyone feels it’s intimate and they’re in a small-classroom setting and let’s give them the best educational experience possible in 53 minutes. You’re trying to engage them and you want people to wake up and say ‘I want to go to class.’
THC: What do you think is signified by the enormous popularity of Stat 104 and Stat 107?
MIP: We were taken by surprise. We were over 500, and we thought it was an error [on Study Card Night] ... we weren’t ready for that number. We still don’t know why we had that number and it’s a weird phenomenon ... No one wants a huge class by nature but we give the students a lot of support because we don’t want them to feel like they can get lost in this huge class.
THC: What advice do you have for students interested in Statistics?
MIP: Take lots of courses. What we like to say is that our concentrators look at the same jobs, if not better jobs, as an Ec concentrator, as a Gov concentrator, as a Computer Science concentrator…To be able to say you can summarize data, you can visualize data, you can analyze data, model data, that’s a skill any company would want. It’s a great field to be interested in … It’s great knowledge to have on your resume and it’s a great skill to have no matter what you plan on doing—graduate school or a full-time job.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Princeton coming to town Friday night, the Harvard men’s basketball has a shot at gaining retribution for falling to the Tigers on the road two weeks ago. In preparation for Friday’s matchup, we caught up with The Daily Princetonian’s Kevin Whitaker via email to learn more about the Tigers. Find out below what the Crimson should do to slow down star forward Ian Hummer, where to grab a meal at Princeton, and how to tell the Tigers’ players apart.
The Harvard Crimson: What can Harvard expect from Princeton this time around?
Kevin Whitaker: I think it's pretty clear at this point that Harvard has a matchup problem with Princeton - four of the Crimson's last five Ivy losses have come at the hands of Tigers. Even if it's not entirely the textbook 'Princeton Offense' principles, the Tigers have turned up the dial on inside cuts and have tried to get players going towards the hoop against Harvard, which has worked well against the swarming perimeter defense. I don't think the Tigers will score 48 second-half points again this time, so it will be up to the defense to continue playing well - I was impressed with Doug Davis' defense and the team's scheme against Brandyn Curry, who was the key player when Harvard won last year.
THC: How has Princeton been playing since the win over Harvard at Jadwin?
KW: It hasn't really been that long, has it? The Tigers have been playing some of their best basketball of the season, especially on offense - starting with the second half against Harvard, Princeton has scored 200 points in 100 minutes. There's been more cutting and more motion, and most importantly, Princeton has been rebounding better. The Tigers are very tall, but they were constantly losing the rebound battle early in the season; throughout the four-game win streak, they've been even or better on the boards.
THC: Ian Hummer has been a big problem for Harvard throughout his career. Have other teams found a way to slow him down, and if so, what have they done?
KW: Well, not many have. Dartmouth had a decent plan against Hummer - a ton of his shots come when he catches the ball off the right block, then curls across the lane to finish on the left side, so when he got the ball, Dartmouth always parked one or two help defenders in the middle of lane, right in his usual path. But that left enough space elsewhere on the court for Doug Davis and a couple others to go off. A desperate team might try that strategy and hope that Princeton's shooters go cold, especially on the road, but I bet Harvard will play more straight-up and trust its interior defenders.
Another good strategy: don't let this happen. People are safely calling it the best dunk in Princeton history.
THC: How do you tell all the Princeton players apart—it seems like everyone has short brown hair?
KW: Haha, this was actually a problem last year, when Dan Mavraides and Will Barrett were playing. This year, there are 'only' three of them - T.J. Bray, Denton Koon and Hummer. Bray is the one who will be taking the ball up the court ... and, well, if you can't tell who Hummer is right away, you'll learn quickly.
THC: In your mind, was the court storming two weeks ago justified?
KW: I wrote about it at length the day after the game, but in short, yes. People mocked the storming because of Princeton's history - 23 straight wins against Harvard at home and all that - and many of them have the image of the nationally ranked Tigers of the '90s and the traditionally crappy Harvard teams. But here's the thing: students may know about the history, but it doesn't really mean anything to us, since our Princeton fandom basically starts at 18. Even I don't feel any emotional connection to those earlier teams, and I grew up in a Princeton family. In my time here, Harvard has provided us with six absolute battles, and this year it came in with huge hype, a shiny number next to its name and a great shot to go 14-0.
Besides, it's college, and court-storming is fun. It's not as if top-ten teams regularly visit Ivy League gyms, so this is likely as good a win Princeton fans will see at home for the next 5-10 years.
THC: How many times a day do you watch the Doug Davis shot?
KW: Funny story - I asked Doug two weeks ago how many times he'd seen it, and he said he thought about 20 total. I'm not sure how much I believe that; hell, I saw it at least 25 times that night alone, and I didn't even shoot the damn thing. To answer the question, I've been trying to restrain myself a lot more lately ... I think I'm down to about seven times a day. Usually when I'm in lecture, to get the people behind me to start involuntarily cheering.
THC: Where is the best spot to eat around Princeton’s campus? When we were up there the other week all we could find were J. Crew stores.
KW: Here's a good test to see if someone's really a Princeton student: Ask them this question. If they don't say Hoagie Haven, they're an imposter. It's a bit of a walk - and not for the health-conscious - but it's amazing.
THC: Final score prediction?
KW: Much as I'd love to be wrong: Harvard 67, Princeton 60.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, the Harvard women’s squash team got the win that eluded it all last season. This weekend, the Crimson is coming back for more.
Off of the heels of clinching the Ivy League title against Yale two weekends ago in New Haven, the eyes of the collegiate squash world now shift to Cambridge, as No. 1 Harvard will play host this weekend for the CSA Team Championships at the Murr Center.
The undefeated Crimson (14-0, 7-0 Ivy) looks to grab its second national title in three years. Last season, the Bulldogs dropped Harvard in both the CSA championship finals and the Ivy League title decider, 5-4.
But with its come-from-behind victory in New Haven giving Yale its first loss in nearly two years, the Crimson now sits in pole position to bring the Howe Cup back to Cambridge.
And after having two weeks of practice to focus on the challenge ahead, co-captain Cece Cortes believes her team is hitting its stride at the perfect time.
“We’ve been working really hard and getting in double sessions,” Cortes said. “We have been working on our match play and our mental tactics, and I think we are an even better team than we were two weeks ago.”
While the wounds of last year’s defeats at the hands of the Bulldogs may be on many people’s minds, Cortes insists the team has all of its attention on the weekend it has ahead.
But Yale is not the only squad on Harvard’s radar. In addition to battling back from a 4-2 deficit against the Bulldogs, the Crimson found itself down 4-1 to Princeton before winning all remaining matches for the 5-4 victory, in a win that Harvard coach Mike Way has previously said “scared the crap out of [the team].”
To carry the team through the weekend, the Crimson will look to freshman Amanda Sobhy. Sobhy, currently ranked 28th by the Women’s International Squash Player’s Association, has man-handled the competition, sweeping all of her opponent this year at the No. 1 position, including the reigning individual national champion, Bulldog sophomore Millie Tomlinson, 11-6, 11-3, 11-5. In those sweeps, no opponent has scored more than seven points on her in any one game.
Sobhy headlines a strong freshman class, one that boast four members in the top nine and has produced strong results so far this season. Rookies Julianne Chu and Megan Murray come into the weekend with only one collegiate loss to their names, and Haley Mendez, playing at the No. 4 spot, claimed both tie-breaking games against Yale and the Tigers to give her team the victories.
It will be an interesting experience for Harvard’s rookies, as hosting a major national tournament is something they are not accustomed to.
“We don’t really know what to expect [as a class],” Mendez said. “I certainly didn’t realize the magnitude of the event–I think 40 or so teams are coming. But we are all very excited to have it at home and have a bunch of our friends come support.”
Cortes is also relishing the opportunity to play where the Crimson feels most at home.
“We know the courts in and out,” Cortes said. “We’re used to the temperature, in terms of the warmth of the ball and the bounce on the court. We have that down and we usually do pretty well on our home courts.”
What Harvard has in young talent it matches with veteran leadership. Junior No. 7 Sarah Mumanachit, whose match-tying victory against the Bulldogs in New Haven turned the tide in the Crimson’s favor, joins Sobhy as Harvard’s only other undefeated player.
Classmate Laura Gemmell, the 2010 individual national champion, and co-captain Nirasha Guruge will take their spots behind Sobhy in the No. 2 and 3 spots, respectively, while junior No. 5 Natasha Kingshott is coming off a strong 9-2 season.
Harvard comes in as the favorite, but Cortes knows her team is going to have to battle.
“Grit is what has kept us on top when we were down against Princeton and Yale,” the senior said. “If we continue to have grit and resilience and determination to fight for every ball and point and to push our bodies to the limit, I think we should be in good shape.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following two commanding wins last weekend, the No. 8 Harvard women’s ice hockey team looks to sustain its momentum entering the ECAC Tournament and position itself for its first NCAA Tournament bid since the 2009-10 season.
The No. 2 seed in the conference, the Crimson (20-8-1, 17-4-1 ECAC) will square off against No. 7 seed Princeton (12-13-4, 10-10-2) in a best-of-three ECAC quarterfinal, starting Friday at 4 p.m. at the Bright Hockey Center. In their most recent meeting, a home matchup on Feb. 4, Harvard routed the Tigers, 10-1, but Princeton was also responsible for one of the Crimson’s four losses in conference play, a 3-0 defeat at Baker Rink on Jan. 6.
“I think, for most of us, the 3-0 loss is still lingering because that was a team we feel like we should not have lost to,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey said. “We didn’t come ready to play and expected things to happen just because we showed up, and we kind of got embarrassed.”
Harvard finished the regular season last weekend with decisive home wins over Brown and Yale, defeating the Bears, 5-1, on Friday and the Bulldogs, 4-0, on Saturday’s Senior Night.
“We were firing on all cylinders [last weekend],” junior defender Josephine Pucci said. “We never stopped playing our game all over the ice, and if we keep that mentality, we’ll be able to play the way we’re capable of [playing] no matter what the score is.”
At eighth and 12th in the conference, respectively, neither Brown nor Yale presented a level of competition equal to that which the Crimson will encounter during the playoffs.
“Any time you can perform well, it shows you some things you can work on and some things you do well,” Pucci said. “[The wins] were definitely a positive, but this is a totally clean sheet. We have to take everything we learned to the games this weekend.”
With a strong showing in the ECAC Tournament, Harvard will be in line to earn a bid to the eight-team NCAA Tournament, either by winning the conference tournament or obtaining one of five at-large slots. But at No. 8 in the country, its position is by no means secure, and an early exit at the hands of the Tigers could leave it on the outside looking in.
“Every game is crucial,” Pucci said. “Looking past each round is not going to do anything. Right now, our focus is on winning the quarterfinal, and then hopefully after that we can focus on winning the semis.”
Spurring the Crimson on in its pursuit of postseason glory are its memories of coming up short last season. Near the end of the 2010-11 season, Harvard was similarly on the bubble, needing an impressive performance in the ECAC Tournament to advance to the NCAAs. But in the 2011 ECAC semifinal, the Crimson fell to Dartmouth, 4-1, at Bright Hockey Center. Ultimately, the Big Green received an at-large bid to the NCAAs, while Harvard watched the tournament from home.
“You only get so many times to put the jersey on,” Dempsey said. “We didn’t know that game [against Dartmouth] we played was our last game. We look at it as a one-game season from here on out.”
Also providing a morale boost to the Crimson was the announcement earlier this week that both Dempsey and Pucci were among the 30 nominees for the 2012 Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award, given annually to the top women’s ice hockey player in NCAA Division I. Dempsey is the team’s leading scorer with 42 points, including a five-goal performance in the 10-1 victory against Princeton, and Pucci is the leading defenseman on a unit that has allowed 1.79 goals per game, the seventh-lowest in the country.
“It’s an incredibly humbling honor to be nominated and even in the same pool as those other kids,” Dempsey said. “They’re all talented and work hard, so it’s really great we were selected for that.”
Individual accolades aside, the Crimson’s attention is still firmly fixed on its matchup with the Tigers, whose only realistic shot at extending their season beyond the ECACs lies in winning the tournament. The quarterfinal series continues on Saturday, with Game 2 scheduled for 3 p.m. and Game 3, if necessary, slated for 3 p.m. Sunday.
“The bottom line is that it’s playoff hockey, and it doesn’t matter what happened in the past,” Dempsey said. “Every opponent brings their best when they play Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are just two weeks left in the Ivy basketball season.
Harvard can clinch at least a share of the Ancient Eight title by sweeping the Killer P’s this weekend at Lavietes Pavilion, where it hasn’t lost in 27 consecutive games—the second-longest current streak in the country.
If it wins both contests, and Yale loses to Columbia and Penn falls to Dartmouth Friday night, the Crimson would win its first outright championship in program history. But there’s about as good a chance of both those things happening as there is of Ron Paul winning the Republican nomination, so Harvard will almost certainly have to wait until next weekend for the chance to clinch an outright title.
Last year, the weekend before the Oscars, I wrote a column comparing every Ancient Eight team to a Best Picture nominee. Though I haven’t seen most of the movies nominated this year—and really, who has?—I did notice some striking similarities between them and the Ivy squads.
For example, Columbia is “Moneyball,” the story of an underdog that overachieves despite losing its best player. Cornell is “Midnight in Paris,” with a man (Chris Wroblewski) realizing that the people he once admired are no longer with him, leaving him nostalgically wishing to return to the better days of the past.
Penn is “The Descendents,” with one major star carrying a story people would otherwise have no interest in. Princeton is “The Help,” as both take place in societies dominated by white people.
Brown is “Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,” as I imagine that’s how most Bears players feel about Jesse Agel. Plus, both bombed despite having two stars and were never really in contention in the first place. Dartmouth is “War Horse,” as each is about as interesting as an early-1900s British period piece about a horse.
Yale is “The Artist,” because it’s silent about things it probably shouldn’t be so silent about. Actually, sorry, I got confused—that’s the Yale Daily News. We’ll say the Bulldogs are “The Tree of Life,” because, like Brad Pitt in the movie, Greg Mangano is a major star that always seems so angry.
That leaves the Crimson as “Hugo”—no standout performances, but strong supporting casts and two great leaders in Tommy Amaker and Martin Scorcese who teach us that the past is not something that to run away from.
On to the week five picks.
PRINCETON (15-10, 6-3 Ivy) AT HARVARD (23-3, 9-1)
Last time the Tigers came to Lavietes, Bill Simmons, Drew Faust, and the Lew Alcindor (pre-superstar) version of Jeremy Lin were in the stands on a magical night in which Harvard clinched a share of its first Ivy title ever.
But as the Crimson would later discover, the old kindergarten lesson of “sharing is caring” that we all learn when playing with toy trucks does not apply when sharer A wins the subsequent truck race by edging out sharer B at the final second, ruining B’s chance to represent the class at the giant toy convention for the first time in 65 years, even though A has already been to the convention 23 times.
Anyway, B has learned its lesson: never share things with anyone unless you absolutely have to. And a win tonight would put it in great position to finally get to that toy convention at long last.
Pick: Harvard 67, Princeton 60
PENN (15-11, 7-2) AT DARTMOUTH (5-21, 1-9)
It’s times like these when you really start to hate having Dartmouth as a travel partner. The Crimson could really use a tired, worn-down Quaker team on the second day of Penn’s road trip tomorrow night, but things like that never happen because Harvard’s Saturday opponent always gets to calmly cruise past the Big Green the night before.
I can’t hate on Dartmouth too much, though, as the squad took my inspirational message to heart last week and beat Brown for the sole purpose of helping me nail down another perfect week of picks.
I can see it now: the Big Green sitting around their locker room reading my column before the game, when all of a sudden Jvonte Brooks yells “Scott’s right, we can do this!” as the rest of the players stand up in agreement. Suddenly, Gabas Maldunas comes in and proclaims “THIS...IS...DARTMOUTH!!!!” The squad runs onto the court all fired up, and the rest is history.
I’m proud of you, Dartmouth, and I appreciated the nice thing you did for me.
But, unfortunately, you’re not winning another game this season. Because, let’s be honest, most of the middle school teams that play in the halftime games could beat you guys.
Pick: Penn 69, Dartmouth 62
COLUMBIA (14-12, 3-7) AT YALE (17-7, 7-3)
These teams have basically been polar opposites this year. Despite their conference records, Yale hasn’t really been the much better squad.
Columbia’s seven conference losses this season have come by an average of just four points, and it’s played the big three of Harvard, Yale, and, most recently, Penn extremely well.
But things just haven’t fallen the Lions’ way, as with last Saturday, when the Quakers hit an alley-oop layup at the overtime buzzer. Anytime you get beat by a male named Fran, you know it’s just not your year.
The Bulldogs, on the other hand, are the third luckiest team in the country, according to Ken Pomeroy.
So, sorry Columbia—sometimes it’s just better to be lucky than good.
Pick: Yale 65, Columbia 58
CORNELL (10-14, 5-5) AT BROWN (7-20, 1-9)
Oh, Brown. You’re just so terrible. You’ve lost seven straight, with your only Ivy win coming against Dartmouth.
I would call you the Cubs since you don’t deserve to be called Bears, but there’s already a bad sports team named the Cubs. And I couldn’t really change your first name either, since there’s not much that represents crap better than the color brown. So, enjoy it, Brown. I’ve run out of jokes to make fun of you—that’s how bad you are.
Cornell, meanwhile, continues to be uninterestingly mediocre. Before lacrosse season gets into gear this weekend, perhaps the hoops team should give Rob Pannell a look. The Big Red could use any help it can get.
Pick: Cornell 62, Brown 58
PENN AT HARVARD
Zachary, this is it. Your last shot, your final hurrah. I know deep down you regret not coming to Harvard when you had the chance. And I know the past four years, all you’ve wanted to do was win an Ivy League title to prove to yourself you made the right decision.
And so, here we are. The biggest game of your life. Time to leave everything on the line. You can’t lose this one, or every single crazy shot you’ve thrown up this season in a last-gasp attempt to singlehandedly carry your team to victory will have been worthless.
Sure, it’s been a great career. But do you always want to be the Quaker Dan Marino, the star that just couldn’t get over the hump?
Of course not. That’s why tomorrow night you need to turn in a performance up there with the likes of flu-ridden MJ in the ’97 finals while Tyler, your fellow desperate senior, plays the Scottie Pippen role.
Yet at the end of the day, Zack, you’ll find yourself falling just short once again, as Harvard is just too good at home.
But when you do, don’t despair too much. Calder and company will be there waiting with a big hug and a fancy, high-quality, super-expensive breakfast buffet when you get home, because in the glorious pancake mecca that is Philadelphia, of course, one would expect nothing less.
Pick: Harvard 67, Penn 62
PRINCETON AT DARTMOUTH
Last time these two teams met, the Big Green held Tigers star Ian Hummer to 0-11 shooting from the field. Princeton won by 12. That’s about all you need to know about Dartmouth.
Pick: Princeton 58, Dartmouth 52
BROWN AT COLUMBIA
If one still doubts the validity of the Ewing Theory—Simmons’ idea that certain teams play better when its best player gets injured or isn’t in the game—consider the Lions.
After losing Noruwa Agho, last year’s Ivy leading scorer, to a season-ending injury just two games into the year, one would’ve predicted Columbia would struggle to win any games at all this season.
But the squad came together in the absence of the ball-dominant guard, and since a two-game adjustment period has gone 14-8—including a 10-1 stretch midway through the year—and, as I mentioned, has been in every Ivy game it has played.
Now, I know what you’re thinking, Brown. But no, you can’t purposely injure Sean McGonagill. It just wouldn’t be right.
Pick: Columbia 57, Brown 54
CORNELL AT YALE
The Bulldogs came out flat in their biggest game of the season once again last Saturday, falling to Harvard by 14. Amazingly, that defeat didn’t even make Yale’s top three losses to the Crimson this year. For it would be tough to do much worse than football’s 45-7 thrashing, men’s basketball’s earlier 65-35 annihilation, and women’s hockey’s 8-0 demolition of the Bulldogs, all of which occurred in New Haven.
In fact, sprinkle in this year’s other disasters—the Patrick Witt and Tom Williams scandals, the 2010-2011 No. 1 men's hockey team’s fall to the middle of the 2011-2012 ECAC pack, Reggie Willhite’s mohawk, the men’s squash team’s epic playoff collapse, and the women’s hockey team’s worst-palindrome-ever 1-27-1 season—and what do you get?
In the eyes of the YDN, only one of the best seasons in the history of Bulldog athletics, of course!
For if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, Yale is currently the beholder, and it’s a drunken, blind pirate who doesn’t know what beauty is.
But we shouldn’t be too hard on our New Haven friends. Because when you’re always finishing behind two other schools, it’s only natural to develop a different definition of success.
So go ahead, Yale, be proud of yourself. You’re doing just great. Hopefully you won’t beat the Big Red and put a dint on all your aforementioned achievements this year.
Pick: Yale 70, Cornell 64
LAST WEEK: 8-0
SEASON: 27-3

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 19 Harvard women’s lacrosse team opens the 2011-2012 season against Boston University on Saturday at Soldiers Field Stadium Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
The Crimson is coming off one of its most successful seasons to date, in which it recorded a 10-6 record and was 5-2 in Ivy league competition—the team’s best mark since 1994.
“I think there is a lot of excitement right now amongst the team for the first game,” co-captain midfielder Melanie Baskind said. “We have been practicing against ourselves for a while. We have high expectations for ourselves this season, and we are looking forward to see how this comes together.”
The team will return with all but one player from last year’s squad. The expectations are high for this team with top scorers, juniors Jennifer VanderMuelen and Danielle Tetreault, returning.
“We have a lot of returning players and we had a good season last year,” VanderMuelen said. “We want to start off where we left off and come out with a strong start to this season.”
VanderMuelen and Tetreault were recently named to the 2012 Tewaaraton Award watch list, which consists of the top 50 women’s lacrosse players in the country. Harvard will need their continued firepower, as both ranked in the top 31 players in goals per game last year.
“I think we are just going have to keep relying on what made us successful in the past,” Baskind said. “We are trying to get better every single day at practice, and we are trying to work hard and soak up everything the coaching staff has told us. Our goal is to continuously get better.”
The Terriers are coming off a less successful season wherein they finished just below the .500 mark. BU’s leading scorer, junior Danielle Etrasco, will look to continue her success from last season, in which she scored 57 goals—good for the eighth-highest goal total in the country.
In last year’s matchup between the two Boston-area teams, the Crimson easily defeated the Terriers, 16-6. Harvard jumped out of the gate, scoring five goals before 15 minutes had passed; Tetreault notched three of those five.
“Last year [we played] a very good game against [the Terriers], but we are both different teams now,” Tetreault said. “We have to come into this year respecting our opponent. Especially for that first game, we need come in and do what we were working on in the preseason and just try to be consistent.”
Last season the Crimson was known for being a dramatic comeback team, after falling behind due to some slow starts. Starting the game off stronger could help propel the Crimson to the next level.
“We have been working a lot on coming out strong and starting strong because we know that is going to make a difference,” VanderMuelen said. “The second half comeback is always exciting, but we want to start the game fast and set the momentum ourselves.”
VanderMuelen also stressed turnovers as a key to Saturday’s game.
“I think we need to limit turnovers,” VanderMuelen said. “It has been something we have been focusing on a lot this preseason, taking care of the ball and maintaining possession of the ball. We are working to be a more consistent team.”
Although Harvard had one of its more successful seasons in recent history last year, the team still fell short of the Ivy League title, after Princeton made a late three-goal comeback in the Ancient Eight championship game, pulling out a 12-10 win.
This year the Crimson will look to use that game as motivation to earn the Ivy Title this season.
“[Last year’s game] is definitely in the back of our minds,” Tetreault said. “It was a tough loss of us and I think throughout this season it will serve as a reminder that we need to work hard every game. We definitely have the players and potential, we just need to put it into action.”
And the quest for an Ivy title begins against the Terriers on Saturday.
“Last years success gives us a lot of confidence, knowing we can run with the top teams,” VanderMuelen said. “I think this year we are not only going to stay with those top teams, but we are going beat those top teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just one weekend left in the Harvard men’s hockey team’s season, the Crimson is still very much in the thick of things in the ECAC—a position Harvard hasn’t been in since the 2007-2008 season.
“We’re entering the last weekend of the season with an opportunity to get home ice and a bye in the playoffs,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s been a few years since we could say that so there’s definitely a lot at stake. We’re trying to mentally get focused and rested so that we can play our best.”
Weekend matchups against conference opponents St. Lawrence (13-16-3, 9-10-1 ECAC) and Clarkson (15-13-6, 9-7-4), will test the Crimson (8-8-11, 6-5-9) which stands one point behind the Knights of Clarkson for fourth place and a first-round bye in the ECAC tournament.
“We have to earn home ice, we understand that,” Donato said. “If we deserve it, then we’ll earn it this weekend against two good teams that we’re fighting for playoff positioning with. It should be a nice challenge for us.”
Harvard met both teams previously on a back-to-back road trip in November, winning at Clarkson, 3-2, before falling to the Saints, 4-3, the following night. But the Crimson is a different team now than it was then, losing only one ECAC game—last weekend against rival Yale, 7-1—in the last month.
Harvard also holds the all-time NCAA ties record, a curious distinction but a distinction nonetheless. Though the Crimson’s penchant for drawing even has kept it afloat in a closely packed ECAC race—a win is worth two points and a tie is worth one—the team will need at least one victory to secure the coveted first-round bye.
“I think as far as the ties go there are good ties and bad ties,” Donato said. “The last couple we’ve had have been closer to the bad ties department, but we had a good streak there on the road coming back late in the third period. It’s a real strange dynamic, one I’m not entirely sure how to digest.”
One would assume that the profligacy of ties would at the very least indicate consistency on Harvard’s part, but that would be too conventional for such an unconventional season. The Crimson defense gives up goals in spurts and the Harvard attack has dominated the power play—to the tune of a 29.5 percent conversion rate, tops in the NCAA and top-20 all time—but sputtered in traditional five-on-five play.
Even the play in goal, which seemed secure under the steady play of freshman Steve Michalek, has fluctuated of late, as Donato has moved away from giving Michalek complete control and opted for a veritable goalkeeper by committee.
All of these questions and more will look to be answered in this weekend’s games, as the Crimson gears up for the post season.
“Our focus really is just on Friday and Saturday night,” Donato said. “You could argue that these are playoff-like games. It’s important for us to focus on coming out and establishing how we want to play and win hockey games. Over the last several years we’ve played our best hockey traditionally in February so we want to keep that going.”
Harvard is 22-3-2 in February home games under Donato and 22-10-6 in post-Beanpot ECAC games.
Last season’s edition of Harvard hockey made a surprisingly deep run into the ECAC tournament after a slow start to the year. The run, which ended in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals against Dartmouth, was sparked in part by the play of then-sophomore defenseman Danny Biega and then-junior attacker Alex Killorn. The pair scored five points apiece in the five-game playoff push and return this season, leading the way once again for the Crimson.
“We’re just kind of focusing on what our team does well,” Killorn said. “We’re happy with the position we’ve put ourselves in this season, and are looking to have some momentum going into the playoffs.”
Killorn is currently fourth in the ECAC in goals, with 18 on the season, including three in the past three games. Biega, a co-captain, leads all defensemen in the league with 28 points.
The pair, along with the rest of the Harvard attack, will have to be on their game to get past a formidable pair of goalies. The Clarkson defense is led by the top goaltender in the ECAC, Paul Karpowich. Karpowich leads the conference with 929 saves on the year, 151 more than the netminder in second, St. Lawrence’s Matt Weninger. Karpowich’s .925 save percentage is second in the conference, and the Knights’ defense is only allowing 2.28 goals per game with him between the pipes.
Even though a home playoff game is guaranteed—seeds 5-8 host first round games—this weekend also marks the last home stand for a senior class that has been through a tumultuous four years.
“I’ve got a lot of family members coming down to see us,” senior defenseman Ryan Grimshaw said. “It’s our senior year, and even though we’ll definitely have a home playoff game, it’s important to try and win your last regular season game on your home ice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It might be the pinnacle of Harvard’s basketball hysteria, but sandwiched between this weekend’s two men’s basketball games, another Crimson team will embark on a journey which it hopes will end in success on the national stage.
Coming off of its winningest season since the 1990s, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team lost only one starter to graduation while adding what is regarded as one of the nation’s best freshmen classes. The team’s ambitions have adjusted accordingly: the No. 14/15 Crimson aims to win its first Ivy League Championship since 1990 and compete for a national title. The season opens at noon on Saturday against Vermont at Soldiers Field,
“For us this year, the sky is the limit,” co-captain Terry White said.
Before head coach Chris Wojcik took the reins last season, Harvard had finished with a winning record in exactly one of its previous nine seasons. Since 1996, the Crimson has qualified for the NCAA tournament only once, a 2006 trip that ended with a first round loss to Syracuse.
But that trend of mediocrity has come to an end, says Wojcik, thanks to talented players, trusting coaches, and ever-growing confidence.
Harvard posted a 10-6 record in 2011, its best regular-season performance since 1998. InsideLacrosse.com ranked the team as the nation’s 14th best at season’s end. But the Crimson’s dreams of an NCAA tournament berth were dashed after a 15-6 loss in the Ivy League Championship game at the hands of rival Cornell, who went on to lose to eventual national champion Virginia in the NCAA quarterfinals.
Still, says co-captain Kevin Vaughan, the season represented an important change in the culture of lacrosse at Harvard.
“It’s no longer going out there just with the expectation of competing. We expect to go out and not just compete with other teams, we expect to win every single game,” he said. “It’s exciting to see that attitude take hold.”
And now, in Wojcik’s second season at the helm, the Crimson appears to have the talent to back up those expectations. The squad returns nine of ten starters from last year’s team, including four of its top five scorers.  Vaughan, fellow co-captain Paul Pate, senior midfielder Daniel DiMaria, and sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp all return after garnering All-New England honors last season; Eipp was also named NEILA Rookie of the Year.
Add to that an incoming freshmen class which boasts six top-100 prospects and is, according to InsideLacrosse.com, “arguably the strongest Ivy recruiting class in at least a decade,” and Harvard appears poised to join the ranks of the nation’s elite programs.
Among the freshmen class’s top recruits are midfielders Sean Mahon and Keegan Michel, defenseman Steven Jahelka, the nation’s eighth-ranked recruit as a senior, Jake Gambitsky, the top-ranked goalie in the nation coming out of high school, and attackman Will Walker. Walker joins his older brother, junior defenseman Jack Walker, on the team, as does fellow freshman Matt Scalise, who joins older brother Mark, a senior midfielder.
“It’s a very talented class and more importantly it’s a group of high character individuals,” Wojcik said. “They’ve come in and competed since day one. We expect them to be major contributors over the next four years.”
But even with the influx of young talent the team’s success will still hinge on the leadership of its veterans. That leadership starts with the three captains: White, Pate, and Vaughan, who is serving his second year in the role.
“The captains have done a great job of creating an atmosphere where everybody is working hard,” Jahelka said. “Over [winter break], I wanted to train hard because I knew how hard all of my buddies were working, and that attitude starts with them.”
The Crimson will look to White, a preseason All-New England pick, and Vaughan to continue their scoring ways as they hold down the midfield unit. Pate, Wojcik says, will be expected to anchor the Harvard defense.
“Honestly, there are so many leaders on this team that it’s made my job pretty easy,” said Vaughan, who was picked in the second round of the Major League Lacrosse Draft earlier this winter.
Harvard begins the season with lofty goals: an Ivy League Championship and, ultimately, a national title. The road to each will be difficult. Yale, Pennsylvania, and Princeton all begin the season as top-20 teams. No. 3/5 Cornell, which has won at least a share of the past nine Ivy League titles, returns seven starters, including senior attackman Rob Pannell, reigning USILA National Player of the Year.
The Crimson will face a number of non-conference tests as well before it begins Ivy League play against Brown on March 17th.  Harvard will look to avenge a defeat from last season when it faces No. 13 Hofstra at home on March 3rd. The Crimson will travel south the following week, facing Georgetown before a matchup with perennial powerhouse Duke on March 12th.
But despite Harvard’s championship dreams, the team, says Vaughan, realizes the importance of taking things one step at a time. It seems to have become a theme for the Crimson: work hard daily on the little things and maximize its chances of reaching the ultimate goals.
“Everybody wants to be that underdog that comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing,” Jahelka said. “But that doesn’t happen if we don’t beat Vermont on Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Well, so much for that. In their attempt to assert their place among the NBA’s elite teams, Jeremy Lin ‘10 and the New York Knicks were derailed by the Miami Heat, falling 102-88 on Thursday night.
The stars came out to watch Lin square off against the league’s best team; Floyd Mayweather, Spike Lee, and Chad Ochocinco all had front row seats for the latest installment of Linsanity. But the Heat threw a wet blanket on the phenomenon, trapping and harassing Lin into a dreadful 1-11 shooting performance and eight turnovers.
After a Carmelo Anthony jumper at the halftime buzzer, the Knicks ended an uneven first half trailing by only four points, 51-47. But the Heat would take control in the third quarter, outscoring the Knicks 29-19, including 25 points from the Heat’s Big Three of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh.
For his part, Lin finished with eight points, six rebounds, and three assists. And, yet again, his turnover numbers were unsustainably high. He looked uncomfortable dealing with Heat point guard Mario Chalmers’ tenacious ball pressure and the traps thrown at him by the Miami big men. Perhaps the league’s most athletic team, the Heat swarmed Lin and the Knicks all night, forcing 12 steals and recording 10 blocks.
Though there’s certainly no reason to write the Knicks off yet, tonight’s result showed that they have quite a long way to go before they can match up effectively with the NBA’s best teams. New York was never able to match the Heat’s defensive intensity and crisp rotation. With the loss, the Knicks’ record again fell below .500 at 17-18.
"It's one game," Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said after the game. "And we're not there yet. They're there. They're the team right now to beat for everybody. They're playing better than everybody. And we're trying to get our team together."
The NBA regular season now pauses for All-Star Weekend, held in Orlando from Friday to Sunday. The Knicks resume play next Wednesday against the struggling Cavaliers before embarking on a tough three-game road trip that includes games against Boston, Dallas, and San Antonio in a four-day span.

Every Friday, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
Feb. 25, 1914: Concert and "Movies" in Union
The postponed concert will be given by the Thomas A. Edison Company who will demonstrate their phonograph in the Union this evening from 7.15 to 8.15 o'clock.
Motion pictures illustrating Captain Scott's disastrous Antartic expedition will be shown in the Union Friday evening at 8 o'clock. This film, found by the rescuers, who came too late to save Captain Scott's party, presents one of the most interesting motion pictures in existence.
Feb. 21, 1919: No Holiday Will Be Granted for Wilson's Arrival Monday
No holiday is to be granted by the University for President Wilson's arrival Monday. Although business in Boston will be suspended at least for two hours during the parade in honor of the President, no respite will be granted the College.
An effort has been made by the League of Nations Society in conjunction with the University Diplomatic Club to get the President to speak at the University. No official action, however, has been taken by the University authorities. Mr. Hunnewell '02, Comptroller of the University and Secretary to the Corporation said yesterday he knew of no invitation and thought it extremely improbable that any action would be taken.
President Wilson according to present plans will make but one public address and that is at Mechanics Hall. Admission to the hall will be by ticket. Those desiring tickets may procure them by application to the Mayor's office. They will be given out until the hall is filled.
Feb. 24, 1961: University Offers Extension Course to Sailors on Nuclear Submarine
A record number of registrants, including half the crew of a United States Naval vessel, have enrolled in the University Department of Extension Courses' Spring Program.
More than 6,300 extension students, the largest group receiving instruction under University auspices, will be able to choose from 13 different Spring courses. All courses count for credit toward the unique degree of Bachelor of Arts in Extension Studies.
A novel feature of this year's program makes possible University instruction for the United States Navy. The University will offer for credit, a kinescoped TV course to Naval personnel aboard the nuclear submarine "George Washington."
"The Anatomy of Revolution," part of a TV extension series given last year by C. Crane Brinton '19, McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History, was "canned" and send aboard the "George Washington" last fall. More than half of the 100 men in the crew have registered for the course.
Feb. 24, 1972: Dormitory Chic
Elitism manifests itself in many ways in a place as competitive as Harvard. We have final clubs, selective majors and, of course, the admissions process itself. One of the most ludicrous forms of elitism here is the annual scramble by freshmen to be admitted into one of the "prestige" Houses—those Houses which have more applications than spaces every year.
Four students living in Adams House, which has traditionally been one of the most over-subscribed Houses, have taken a praiseworthy step toward ending the aura of prestige there. The four—David L. Johnson '74, James M. Downey '74, John E. Baker '74 and Ronald Beaulieu '73—are proposing an end to the admissions procedures which purport to select the students best suited to live in Adams House.
Under the proposal, the present admissions process, which involves written applications, interviews and recommendations solicited from the House's staff and members, would be replaced by a random lottery of those freshmen who had picked Adams House as their first choice. This system would make desire to live in the House the only criterion for admissions. Beyond this, all applicants would be placed on an equal footing. A first-choice lottery would also serve the demands of the students rather than the demands of the House. As Johnson put it, "What the House needs and the traditions of the House are not nearly as important as the needs of the students."

Backpacks: bulging with books, heavy with technology, guardians of our stuff, and utterly shrouded in mystery. Can we judge the contents of a backpack by its cover?

Housing season has officially begun. Adams House has released an official Housing Day video, a parody of "The Hunger Games" entitled "The Housing Games".
In the video, the main character (inspired by the book's Katniss Everdeen) volunteers to take the place of her sister/best friend (it is hard to tell which) who is sentenced to Cabot House.
The central premise of the parody is that those not placed in Adams will not have time to eat during the day (because their Houses are too far away and/or the lines are too long) and therefore that they will be doomed to hunger.
Check out the video and tell us what you think.

Last week on Feb. 17, Tyra Banks graduated from the Harvard Business School's Owner/President Management Program, in which she enrolled last year.
Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Tyrese Gibson congratulated the supermodel, talk show host, actress, author, business-woman and now-Harvard grad on her accomplishment via twitter.
"So proud of @tyrabanks 4 graduating Harvard Business School #rolemodel," Kardashian tweeted.
Banks, who according to her own tweet was "smiling ear2ear" after graduating, said that her experience at HBS was invaluable in helping her run her company, and that the education was not quite what she expected.
"I thought we'd be taught, 'profit, profit, profit, win, win, win, go, go, go,'" she told Business Week after graduating. "Instead, we were hearing about the importance of exposing vulnerability to your team. It's soft stuff, talk-show stuff."
And although Banks is leaving, she said that she's left her mark on Harvard Business School. "My marketing professor Rohit Deshpande is now doing a case study on my business," she said in the same interview. "I'm now going to be part of the Harvard Business School curriculum."
It seems that, just like a Top Model, Tyra Banks finished on top.
