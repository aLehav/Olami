After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve been to dozens of games in my three years at this school, and last night’s Harvard-Yale basketball game was different. Hands down, the most energetic, passionate student section in a long, long time.
Within 15 minutes after tip-off, I was getting texts that all free undergraduate tickets had been distributed. Sitting across from the student section, you could visibly see folks jostling for space along the walkways and looking for empty seats in other sections. Many people were turned away at the door, something that is just unheard of in my time covering this team.
You could feel it right away. Yale started the game disjointed, flat-footed, and sloppy. Arriving at Lavietes only an hour until tip-off due to Boston traffic (of course) and in front of numerous NBA scouts and executives, the Bulldogs fell behind 7-14 and never seemed to stand a chance against the Crimson. This did not look like a team that was on an eight-game tear.
But beyond what was developing on the court, it was evident the student section was unlike that of recent memory — when largely sparse, sedentary friend groups would come out across the river and show a bit of love (while doing homework at halftime. Yes, I’m serious).
This actually seemed like a night when the Crimson Crazies earned their moniker. When Harvard was on defense, the crowd let out a strident yell in attempts to deafen the Bulldogs’ playcalling. On Yale free throws, students gave friendly chirps to the opposing shooter. Perhaps the highlight of the night? When Harvard had all but sealed the contest late in the second half, a small group of students began to yell, “We Want Duke!”
The fervor and passion that was exuded last night did not go unignored by the home team. It was so loud at some points in the contest that coach Tommy Amaker had to temper down, rather than invigorate, his side.
“We had great fan support today, the gym was packed,” sophomore forward Danilo Djuricic said. “It really helped propel us to victory and give us some fire to, keep going on runs and make great plays.”
“At times, this is where our kids have to manage it a little better,” Amaker added. “Sometimes we get caught up in that and wanted to do a little too much because of that, because of the energy and the frenzy. We have to fight those things. Those are good things, issues and problems for us to work through.”
As the Crimson marches on in its Ancient Eight slate now having downed the hottest team in the league, the excitement and thrill of an uber-competitive Ivy League should only continue. It was certainly an incredible scene to witness last night at Lavietes, but will it persist?
Only the Crimson Crazies can answer that question.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After playing host to an exhilarating double-digit stomp over Yale on Friday night, Lavietes Pavilion felt in some ways, a bit dead and exhausted.
But even without the same fireworks and animosity that characterizes a bout against the Bulldogs, Harvard men’s basketball largely repeated what it had done the night before: a wire-to-wire, balanced-scoring night that saw junior guard Justin Bassey shut down the opposing team’s leading scorer.
After Bassey limited highly-touted Yale junior Miye Oni to a 3-of-15 night from the field, the Denver, Colo., native put up another shutdown performance against sophomore guard Desmond Cambridge— who, like Oni, was also drawing attention from NBA scouts with his team-leading 17.9 points per game. Cambridge finished with just four points on 1-of-13 from the field, with eight missed triples.
“We pride ourselves on that [defense] and [Bassey] has embraced that and has set the tone and the set the standard for our program,” Amaker said. “I'm just really really encouraged with Justin’s overall play but it certainly starts with his defense.”
The team’s balanced scoring saw four players in double digits, led by junior guard Bryce Aiken’s 12 points. After limited to just 16 minutes against Yale, Aiken was given an expanded role Saturday night and was able to maintain solid spacing with his shifty and fluid ball-handling abilities in the game's 68-47 win.
After seeing just three minutes of action on Friday night, backup big Henry Welsh provided an instant spark off the bench to start the contest. Starting five Chris Lewis, who had accumulated 35 minutes against Yale, was quickly whistled for two early fouls and hit the bench before the first media timeout.
With the Crimson having scored just five points before Welsh took the floor, it was appropriate that the rested big was the one who accelerated the team forward. Welsh earned his first bucket with a spin-around and-one layup, but missed the ensuing free throw. Less than a minute later, the Redondo Beach, Calif, native broke through with another lefty lay-up and-one, but once more could not complete the traditional trey. Finally, Welsh’s misfortune at the line ended, knocking down two at the charity stripe after an inside feed from freshman Noah Kirkwood.
“I wasn’t trying to do anything different than I usually do,” Welsh said. “Just wanted to come in and do whatever I could to help the team, and I think it just so happened that the ball kind of bounced my way. I got the ball and post couple times. Got a lot of great feeds from one from Noah [Kirkwood], a couple from Rio [Haskett], they made my job really easy.”
By the time coach Amaker called back Lewis at the halfway point of the first frame, Welsh had tallied a team-high eight points.
On the Bears side, it was another bench role player who kept Mike Martin’s side at a stone’s throw from evening the contest. Sophomore guard George Mawanda-Kalema, who had entered the game averaging just 3.1 PPG, was the sole offensive contributor for the Bears for nine minutes in the middle of the frame. Following an and-one drive in by Mawanda-Kalema — his eighth point— at the 9:22 mark, Brown trailed 15-12. The guard would finish the half with 11 points on 4-of-5 shooting.
The Crimson broke through for two threes from Bassey and Baker to extend the lead to 21-12 with eight minutes remaining, but both teams went stone cold for three minutes. The final portion of the half saw improved offense performance, but largely for the visitors. Outside of a single Kirkwood conversion attacking the paint and two Aiken free throws, Harvard was scoreless in the final 4:58. 
Mawenda-Kalema converted another triple, and some more free throw opportunities left the Bears trailing by just six points at halftime. As evident by some of the sluggishness of the frame, Harvard and Brown each racked up 10 turnovers and combined for 20 fouls.
The Crimson kept its negative energy inside the locker room coming out of halftime, as a Bassey triple and Baker uncontested dunk propelled Harvard back into a double-digit lead.
However, both teams saw another sequence of languishing play and it would take an Aiken inbounds three and a follow-up triple from junior Zach Hunsaker to open up the scoring stream. Back-to-back layups by Lewis followed by another easy drive-in finish by Bassey brought the Crimson lead to 14, its highest of the night.
Harvard extended that margin to 17 by the 11-minute mark, with a lone triple from Bears’ senior Obi Okolie interrupting 14 unanswered Harvard points. The Crimson held on to a lead that bordered on 20 points in an otherwise quiet second half. By the end of the contest, one could hear the squeaks and play calls of both sides even from the top of the building. The Bears tried to keep things interesting with a full-court press, but the remainder of the contest ended without too much fanfare.
“I thought our defense all weekend for both games was outstanding,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think we talked about that last night and we carried through with that tonight, and just really pleased. That’s basically the biggest pillar and component to our program.”
After a star-studded spectator crowd on Friday night — which included a slew of notable basketball figures such as Celtics President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge, Saturday night saw the appearance of a less discreet but equally noteworthy spectator: former Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust.
Faust’s appearance back in her familiar baseline seat proved to be a good sign for the Crimson, which will have yet another homestand, welcoming Cornell and Columbia next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team hosted two competitive MIVA teams this past weekend at the Malkin Athletic Center, but will need to wait another weekend to earn its second win of the year.
PURDUE FORT WAYNE 3, HARVARD 1
On Saturday night, Harvard (1-5, 1-0 EIVA) faced the Purdue Mastodons (5-4, 0-0 MIVA). The first set of the match showed both teams prowess as the set came to a deadlock near the end. A quick timeout before match point saw the Crimson take a point to bring the score 23-24 before they ultimately fell to Mastodons 23-25.
Coming into the second set, both teams were once again at a stalemate until freshmen Eric Li’s kill early into the set allowed Harvard to go on an offensive tear. The Crimson maintained the 4 point lead throughout the rest of the set, ultimately closing the it out 25-21.
Harvard continued its pace into the third set until Purdue solidified its defense midway through the set. However, the Crimson continued to push through, equalizing the score at 22-22. Two quick points from the Mastodons forced a timeout before match-point eventually gave Purdue the set, 25-23.
Down 1-2 in sets, Harvard’s defense staggered, allowing the Mastodons to widen a gap with a strong kill by No.5 Colton Stone. Purdue’s offense was too much to contain for the remainder of the set, resulting in a 16-25 set and a Crimson loss.
“Every match we’ve competed well in and have had chances to win,” head coach Brian Baise said. “It’s really encouraging, but we are struggling to have everyone together playing well on the same night. We served better and had fewer errors, but they just had a few weapons that were really tough, such as No. 14 Pelegrin Vargas.”
BALL STATE 3, HARVARD 2
Coming off of a convincing 3-1 win over conference rivals Sacred Heart, Harvard (1-4, 1-0 EIVA) looked to take on the No.11 Ball State (4-4, 1-0 MIVA) on Friday night.
The Crimson came out with high intensity, able to match the Cardinals and pull out a 25-22 first set win.
In the second set, Ball State came back with a resounding 25-19 effort over Harvard, equalizing the match at one apiece. An intense third and fourth set resulted in the Cardinals and the Crimson each taking a set, leaving the match at 2-2.
“I didn’t think we did quite as good as job getting in front of the hitters,”junior co-captain Matthew Ctvrtlik said. “Against their strongest hitters, we weren’t getting great touches and they were getting easy kills. I thought that defensively we have a good core group of guys to dig balls, we just have to give them the opportunity to dig balls.”
Despite sophomore Griffin Schmit’s match high 20 kills throughout the match and Ctvrtlik’s 46 assists, The Crimson was unable to capitalize in the fifth set, resulting in Ball State’s 3-2 win over Harvard.
In looking forward to in conference matches against Penn State and Saint Francis next week, Baise preached better set-up play.
“We need to continue to work on our serves and receives,” Baise said. “We’re a much better team when we’re passing well. We also have to get better defensively and lock down other’s offenses. Back row defense can definitely be worked on and so can the serve. We’ve got to be aggressive and get opponents off the net if we’re going to win.”
Ctvrtlik also emphasized team chemistry for the team’s future.
“We’ve lined up well and have gotten good touches,” Ctvrtlik said. “However, we can definitely improve our bonding on the court. Once we can get a couple more games on our belt, I think we’ll definitely be on the same page and everything will start clicking together.”
