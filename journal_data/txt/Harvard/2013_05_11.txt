Whether you're looking to relive the days of Prohibition or want to jet off on the U.S.S.Â Enterprise, summer movie season is here to satisfy your cinematic needs.
"The Great Gatsby"
 
It's the novel that everyone read (the Sparknotes for) in high school, turned cinematic wonder/train wreck by way of the always trippy Baz Luhrmann. The parties! The pink suits! The probable butchering of Fitzgerald's classic! We can't promise that you're going to like it, but it'd be unfashionable to not have an opinion about it.
"Iron Man 3"
 
"Iron Man" and "Iron Man 2" proved that the charm of Robert Downey, Jr. is enough to make you forget that you loathe Gwyneth Paltrow. So stop reading Goop and go see this film, which might just be the best "Iron Man" yet.
 
"Mud"
A Huck Finn-esque tale from the director of "Take Shelter," "Mud" offers further proof that Matthew McConaughey has decided to be a legitimate actor. Seriously, critics are raving about this under-the-radar flick, which co-stars Reese Witherspoon and two kids named Ellis and Neckbone. We suggest you hop on your raft and head down the Charles to catch a viewing at the AMC Loews Boston Common.
"Star Trek Into Darkness"
 
The follow up to 2009's "Star Trek" reboot doesn't come out until May 17, but given that J.J. Abrams's first adventure on the Enterprise was pretty entertaining, we're feeling optimistic. In addition to the return of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's eyebrows, Benedict Cumberbatch plays a mysterious villain named John Harrison.
