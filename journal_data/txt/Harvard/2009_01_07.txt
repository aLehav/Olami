People’s beliefs about the health effects of “third-hand smoke” are positively correlated to the extent to which smoking in their homes is prohibited, according to a recent Harvard study.“Third-hand smoke,” a term coined by the study’s authors, is defined as the smoke that remains after a cigarette is extinguished. The study, which was led by Jonathan P. Winickoff, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, sought to uncover the health beliefs of adults about the inhalation of third-hand smoke and how those beliefs vary across smokers and nonsmokers.Although the researchers found a positive correlation between opinions about the health impacts of third-hand smoke and prohibiting smoking in the home, the two factors are independently associated.“We knew that parents thought that second-hand smoke was harmful to their children,” Winickoff said. “But we needed a way to capture the idea that just because the smoke wasn’t visible, it was still harmful.”Crawling babies and toddlers are especially susceptible to third-hand smoke, as they tend to be closer to contaminated surfaces, Winickoff explained. He added that because children weigh less, toxins that they inhale affect them more than they do adults.Winickoff and his colleagues collected their data through a national random-digit-dial telephone survey from September to November 2005. Their analysis of the gathered data revealed that 65.2 percent of nonsmokers said they thought that third-hand smoke harms children, compared 43.3 percent of smokers. Additionally, 95.4 percent of nonsmokers said they thought that secondhand smoke is damaging to children’s health, compared to 84.1 percent of smokers. The researchers also found that nonsmokers’ households were more likely to enforce strict rules against smoking in their homes than those of smokers—88.4 percent versus 26.7 percent. They concluded that emphasizing that third-hand smoke harms children’s health may be important in persuading adults to prohibit smoking at home, Winickoff said. Joan Friebely, one of the study’s co-authors, as well as an instructor at HMS and a researcher at the Center for Child and Health Policy at Mass. General Hospital, said she was not surprised about the study’s results.“It should give another reason to protect their kids and other friends and family from smoking and may also help them quit smoking,” Friebely said.—Staff writer Marianna N.

Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan will be nominated to serve as President-elect Barack Obama’s solicitor general, the administration’s representative to the Supreme Court, Obama announced in a press release Monday morning.If confirmed by the Senate, Kagan will represent the federal government, party to about two-thirds of cases brought before the high court, and play an integral role in guiding the administration’s interaction with the Supreme Court, working under Obama’s nominee for attorney general, Eric J. Holder.“I am honored and grateful, awestruck and excited, to be asked to contribute to this most important endeavor,” Kagan wrote in an e-mail to the Law School community.Kagan said that she viewed the post as an opportunity to “help advance this nation’s commitment to the rule of law at what I think is a critical time in our history.”Kagan announced that she plans to take a leave of absence from the faculty of the Law School and resign the deanship, which she has held since 2003. During her tenure as dean, she has drawn acclaim for bridging ideological divides among the faculty, poaching several renowned professors from rival law schools, and ushering in a slew of student-oriented reforms.University President Drew G. Faust lauded Kagan in an e-mailed statement, saying that because of her, “the student experience is richer, the curriculum fresher, and the school continues to enhance its worldwide leadership in legal education and scholarship.”NOT A QUESTION OF EXPERIENCEThough Kagan has never appeared before the Supreme Court, several law professors said that they expected her to ease into the new role after spending over five years within what they called one of the most contentious legal environments in the country.“The best oral advocate is someone who can understand what the question is,” said Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford Law School professor who argued a high-profile Internet copyright case before the Supreme Court in 2002. “It’s not about rhetoric.”Lessig will return to Harvard this summer—one of Kagan’s many recruiting coups as dean.Constitutional law expert Laurence H. Tribe ’62, who has argued over 30 cases before the Supreme Court, gave a similarly glowing endorsement of Kagan’s abilities. He pointed to her deft handling of a politically and philosophically divided faculty as evidence for her future success as solicitor general.“If it were anyone other than Elena Kagan, then a lack of experience would be a problem,” he said.Tribe employed both Kagan and Obama as research assistants during their time at Harvard Law School, which did not overlap. In recent years, Tribe has generously praised Kagan and emerged as a close adviser to Obama.According to Reagan administration solicitor general and noted conservative Charles Fried, Kagan’s lack of experience advocating before the justices may even be an asset. Calling her a “fresh face,” Fried said that some of the justices might “appreciate” the presence of a relative newcomer.Media reports mentioned Kathleen M. Sullivan, dean of Stanford Law School from 1999 to 2004, as one of Kagan’s main competitors for the post. Unlike Kagan, Sullivan has appeared several times before the Supreme Court, and she is also known in some legal circles as a highly skilled litigator.Despite Sullivan’s greater experience litigating, Kagan has a longer history with Obama, stretching back to their shared time on the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in the early and mid-1990s. Kagan has supported Obama, a Law School graduate, in the past as well.But Kagan’s relationship with Obama may not have been a deciding factor. “Sullivan took herself out of consideration well over a month ago,” Tribe said. “Her name was bandied about in the media, but she was never a serious contender.”CHALLENGES FOR THE NEXT DEANObama’s gain, though, is already being viewed by Law School faculty as Harvard’s loss. Many say they agree that Kagan’s successor will find it difficult to follow Kagan, who was described by law professor Einer R. Elhauge as “the greatest dean in her time.”Other legal academics have expressed uncertainty over whether Harvard can build upon the institutional improvements that Kagan has enacted or whether it will backslide after her departure.“The question is how much of this is due to her—the force of her personality and her skill—and how much of it is the change in institutional culture,” said Brian R. Leiter, a University of Chicago law professor and legal blogger. “If it’s all dependent on her force of personality, Harvard is in trouble.”The decline of the University’s endowment, which fell by an estimated 22 percent in four months during a period of global economic turmoil, may restrict the new dean’s first moves. As the University prepares to tighten its belt, Kagan’s successor will inherit the responsibility of making decisions based on financial compromises.As a result, Law School professor Richard H. Fallon said, it will be difficult to distinguish any changes brought about by a new dean from those forced by the economic climate.Fallon said that by the nature of the varied demands in the job description, the next dean of the Law School faces a “virtually impossible” job upon moving into Kagan’s office in Griswold Hall.“I don’t know anybody who has the energy and diverse set of talents to do all those things as well as Elena has done them over the past six years,” he said.During her time at the Law School, Kagan has taught constitutional and administrative law. She became dean after just two years as a full professor, succeeding Robert C. Clark in 2003.Kagan clerked for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and U.S. Appeals Court Judge Abner Mikva before serving as a domestic policy adviser under President Clinton.The announcement marks a continuation of Obama’s push to put in place his cabinet and key advisers as soon as possible. By contrast, President Bush’s first solicitor general, Theodore B. Olson, was nominated on Feb. 14, 2001 and did not take the oath of office until June of that year.Faust said that she will consider appointing an acting dean to run the Law School if Kagan departs but that “the nature and timing of our own next steps [are] dependent on the course of the Senate’s confirmation process.”—Staff writer Elias J.

With the national unemployment rate nearing 7 percent—a figure not seen in the U.S. since 1993—several states have seen their unemployment insurance trust funds shrink to dangerously low levels, with some states already taking out federal loans to pay unemployment benefits. But Massachusetts’ unemployment benefit system remains “strong and solvent” for the foreseeable future, bolstered by over $1 billion in trust fund reserves, according to Robb Smith, director of Policy and Planning for the Mass. Labor and Workforce Development Office.From January through November 2008, the state collected $1.4 billion in employer contributions and paid out $1.3 billion in benefits. While employer contribution tax rates are set to increase this year, Smith said unemployment would likely increase as well—he estimated that the state would take in $1.5 billion in employee contributions in 2009, while paying out $1.7 billion in benefits.“We’ve taken a look at the future with worst case scenarios, and we’re looking pretty good,” Smith said. “In 2008, we ended the year with the same amount of money we began the year with, which is not a bad thing. It would have been better if we made some money obviously, but we essentially have a billion dollars in reserve.”Massachusetts ended November with $1.4 billion in its unemployment trust fund. In comparison, neighboring Rhode Island finished the month with under $100 million, and Michigan, hit hard by the auto industry’s collapse, is in debt by roughly half a billion dollars and is implementing a “solvency tax” on some employers to help replenish its fund.The National Employment Law Project—an advocacy group for low-wage workers—reported in late September that Massachusetts was “marginally solvent,” meaning it could pay seven to 11 months of benefits using its reserves. Massachusetts’ unemployment trust fund became insolvent during the 2003 recession, prompting the state to revamp its unemployment insurance system.The system today includes five “schedules,” or brackets, of employer contribution levels, ranging from Schedule A, the lowest, to Schedule E, the highest, implemented based on trust fund reserve levels.The state was supposed to shift from Schedule D to E in 2008, but the change was delayed until this year by the legislature. “We’ve had no serious opposition to [the shift],” Smith said.“Nobody likes it being done, but having unemployment insurance is a necessary safety net in the modern economy.” Some experts suggested that further changes could help ensure future solvency in the trust fund and also benefit unemployed workers.“One thing that could increase the long-term stability of a system is to increase the wage base on which unemployment taxes are calculated, and to index that to inflation,” said Noah Berger, the executive director of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center.The state currently taxes up to $14,000 of employee income.Margaret Monsell, an attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, voiced similar suggestions.“There’s some kind of tension between the amount of taxes paid—which is based on a fairly low number—and benefits received, which in a high wage, high cost-of-living state like Massachusetts is fairly high,” Monsell said.“I think increasing the taxable wage base to reduce the gap between employer payments and employee benefits would be prudent to consider.”—Staff writer Peter F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifteen-year-old Mahzarin R. Banaji says she dreamed of living the adventurous life of a secretary upon graduating from high school because she believed that further academic pursuit was useless and was thirsting for an independent life away from her home in Secunderabad, India. 
But a little less than a decade later—after a series of self-described “fortuitous” events—Banaji found herself a student at Ohio State University, studying for a Ph.D. in social psychology. And in 2002 she became a Harvard professor at the invitation of University President Drew G. Faust, then-dean of the newly-founded Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. 
Today Banaji is the Richard Clarke Cabot Professor of Social Ethics in the psychology department, where she has pioneered the study of unconscious prejudice. “Professor Banaji is one of the most celebrated, most cited, and most influential social psychologists of her generation for good reason—her work on unconscious bias has revolutionized how we think about the topic,” Psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert wrote in an e-mail. 
In his best-selling book “Blink,” Malcolm Gladwell devoted 12 pages to Banaji’s research on the Implicit Association Test, a methodology created by Banaji’s dissertation advisor, Anthony G. Greenwald, in 1994. The test is designed to measure the strength of automatic association and is an important tool in social psychology today. 
“Individuals are created and shaped by social circumstances far more than they or their observers are able to recognize,” Banaji wrote in an unpublished biography for the Guggenheim Foundation. “Mainly in retrospect, I see my career as a textbook case of how fortuitous circumstances and responsive bystanders eased the path for my growth.” 
THE ROAD TO THE IVORY TOWER 
After a few late-night talks with her mother, who never attended college herself, Banaji suspended her plans to enter the typing pool and agreed to give college a try for one semester, after which the two agreed that Banaji would be free to choose her own path. That one semester proved to be worthwhile for Banaji. Initially attracted to Nizam College for its co-educational system and proximity to the largest cricket stadium in Hyderabad, Banaji says she found the cosmopolitan social and academic environment a liberating experience. Her ambition of becoming a secretary aborted, she went on to pursue an M.Phil/Ph.D. in general psychology at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. 
Mind-opening as JNU would prove to be, Banaji never finished her study there. “There are few occasions in one’s life when a course of action presents itself with such clarity that there is nothing to do but pursue it,” she wrote in her Guggenheim biography. While she was on the train home from New Delhi for the holidays, Banaji purchased five volumes of the Handbook of Social Psychology edited by Lindzey and Aronson, for five dollars, lured not so much by the books’ content as by their low price. By the time she arrived home 24 hours later, she had already devoured an entire volume. She says the combination of a focus on social process with an experimental approach presented by the book particularly appealed to her.
A year later, Banaji boarded a plane to Columbus, Ohio, leaving the psychophysics and Marxist sociology she had been studying in India behind. After receiving her Ph.D. from Ohio State in social psychology, Banaji traveled around the country as research assistant, instructor, and post-doc fellow in several different institutes, before she finally settled at Yale to study unconscious bias. 
When the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Studies was founded in 2001, Banaji accepted the invitation to teach at Harvard, becoming a professor in the Department of Psychology and the Carol K. Pforzheimer Professor at Radcliffe. 
‘THE MADONNA OF OUR FIELD’ 
Reflecting on her unusual career path, Banaji says she is reluctant to use her own life as a model for students. But she says she is a strong advocate for women in science careers. 
Her implicit association experiments have shown that even female scientists can unconsciously associate men with terms like “astronomy” and “chemistry” and women with “music” and “history.” 
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers once quoted Banaji on unconscious prejudice against women in science, recommending people to visit the Web site for the Implicit Association Test, which is maintained by Banaji and her former student Brian A. Nosek, now a psychology professor at the University of Virginia. Just months before, Summers had made his now-infamous comments that attributed the dearth of women in top science careers to “issues of intrinsic aptitude.” 
Knowing this prejudice well, Banaji says she always goes out of her way to support aspiring female students in science. 
“For younger women whose identity as women in science is not fully formed, I need to keep an eye out,” Banaji says. “If somebody like that comes along and asks, ‘I wanna give up mathematics for social studies,’ [I would suggest to her] ‘well, hold on, maybe you should go. But maybe you shouldn’t.’” 
“As a young woman, I cannot tell you how she has influenced the generations after her,” Dana R. Carney, a former post-doctoral student of Banaji’s, wrote in an e-mail. “She is like the Madonna of our field: masculine, feminine, fierce, warm, irreverent, creative, inspiring.” Carney is now an assistant professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business. She says she still remembers listening to Banaji’s “mesmerizing” speech as a first year graduate student, five years before she became her post-doc student. “I remember going up to her...and I shook her hand, and I told her that it’s so rare as a young woman you’ve got to model yourself after those people that sort of defy gender stereotype,” Carney recalls. “She is just a scientist. She is not a woman. She is not a man. She is just so inspiring.” 
CRITICAL, BUT CARING 
In 2006, Banaji journeyed to Philadelphia to pay tribute to her Ph.D. adviser Greenwald, who was receiving the Distinguished Scientist Award, a prestigious prize given by the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Banaji delivered an address recounting her memory of Greenwald. “It made the entire room of five or six hundred people cry,” Carney says, referring to Banaji’s speech. “It was just mind blowing.” 
“Tony Greenwald changed my life,” Banaji says. “He didn’t care what I knew, or how little I knew, or how poor a writer I was...he just wouldn’t let go. If I wrote a draft and I gave it to him he would mark it again, but the 13th draft he would still mark it. Every draft, I saved them all.” 
Banaji attributes her pedagogical skill in part to Greenwald, saying that he has had an important impact on how she interacts with her students. Greenwald, however, says he disagrees. 
“As a teacher, she has abilities that I barely comprehend,” he wrote in an e-mail. “I have no idea how she acquired her skill, other than to be sure that she didn’t get it from me.” 
Greenwald does say that both he and Banaji require their advisees to learn how to thrive while receiving more criticism than praise, as they share the belief that perseverance in the face of criticism is a trait shared by almost all successful scientists. 
“She just really had a unique combination of being incredibly rigorous and demanding, but at the same time you knew she supported you and that her heart was with you,” said Curtis D. Hardin, Banaji’s first Ph.D. student and now a professor at Brooklyn College. “For one thing, any paper, from paper in the class to thesis, was met with just incredibly detailed line by line comments, suggestions, questions...this is probably the biggest sign of love because it takes a lot to do that.” 
Hardin adds that Banaji and her husband always open their home to graduate students. “She taught me how to cook simple Indian dishes, and we watched elections together. Their company was just so good,” Hardin says. “They knew what it was like to be a starting graduate student.” 
Banaji is deeply involved in the undergraduate experience at Harvard, too. As Head Tutor for the Psychology Department, she leads a committee on undergraduate instruction and oversees all students writing theses. She also has three freshman advisees. 
“Even though she’s my academic advisor she would talk to me like my old-time friend, and she really cares about how I am doing and my emotional state,” says Nam Hee Kim ’12, one of her advisees. 
Looking back, Banaji says that her teaching experience in India at the age of five might have shaped how she communicates with students today. After Banaji and her sister were born, their mother, a school teacher, became unhappy that she had to stay at home and could not teach anymore. She had a carpenter make three small tables and very little chairs, and opened a school in the house. 
“I would be home, so I had to deal with all the kids. So my mother would say, ‘you are five years old, you teach this four-year old how to write letters. Every year I was teaching somebody one year younger than I,” Banaji says. “By the time I was eight, I had three years of teaching experience.” 
“Now teaching graduate students, you know, is my life,” she adds.

Being bootylicious has helped many a hip-hop career, but now Harvard Medical School research has found that it can also help your health.A study led by HMS professor C. Ronald Kahn found that the kind of fat that has made Jennifer Lopez famous—fat found in the buttocks and thighs—may actually help prevent diabetes.Those with generous derrieres, or “pear-shaped” bodies, store subcutaneous fat in their hips and buttocks. Those with “apple-shaped” bodies tend to store weight around their abdomens.Researchers already knew abdominal obesity came with a higher risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. What Kahn wanted to know was what would happen if the fat from the two areas was switched. So he injected lower-body fat from mice into their abdomens.“What we found was that moving the fat under the skin and hips...actually improved metabolism,” Kahn said in an interview.Mice with the transplanted fat lost weight, had lower insulin levels, and had better insulin sensitivity.Kahn had found that not all fat is created equal: subcutaneous fat from the lower body, it turns out, is very different from abdominal fat.What the difference is, exactly, has yet to be discovered. That kind of finding would have “enormous implications” for the understanding of obesity and diabetes and for the pharmaceutical industry, said Philip Gorden, the former director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.Those who aren’t fortunate enough to be callipygian, however, can’t do much.“It’s very hard for people to control their fat distribution,” Gorden said. “What they can control is the quantity of fat.”Procedures like liposuction have been shown to have no effect on diabetes, Kahn said, but fortunately, when people lose weight, they tend to lose abdominal fat first. Kahn’s work, said Gorden, is more about understanding the fundamental “why” of risk. “We need to keep searching for central mechanisms that control why abdominal obesity confers so much risk,” he said.Kahn is now exploring the questions that his findings have raised.“What we are trying to do now is to show if transplanting fat would actually protect you against diabetes or bad effects of obesity even if you’re on a high-fat diet,” he said. “Secondly, we’re trying to...isolate from subcutaneous fat the different kinds of proteins it might secrete into the bloodstream that might have a beneficial effect.”“Even though fat has been around forever and has been studied for many years, there are still a lot of things we don’t understand,” Kahn said.—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

A foundation responsible for funding two Harvard programs at nearly $1 million has been forced to close amid Bernard L. Madoff’s $50 billion securities fraud.Both Harvard groups, which were supported by the JEHT Foundation, received the amount they were promised before the philanthropic organization shut down.The International Human Rights Clinic at Harvard Law School received a total of $161,261 in 2006 and 2008 for its South Africa Apartheid Litigation project.“We’ve received the full amount. The grants are completed essentially,” said Clinical Director Tyler R. Giannini.The project aimed to seek accountability for U.S. corporations allegedly complicit in abuses committed by the South African government under apartheid.Giannini added that if the clinic plans to do a similar project in the future, it would have to find new donors.“But we are constantly looking for new funders to support important work we do,” he said.The Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management at Harvard Kennedy School received $768,739 from JEHT in 2005 for a three-year project aimed at invigorating state and local enforcement of human rights standards.“The grant was fully paid some time ago, so we do not expect any impact on our work from the Madoff scandal,” Kennedy School professor Christopher E. Stone ’78, faculty chair of the program, said in an e-mail.The College’s Office of Sponsored Programs also received $263,418 from JEHT in fiscal year 2007, according to a list of grant recipients on Bloomberg.com, but the Web site does not indicate what the money was for and whether the funded program was a continuing one.Ethlyn O’Garro, director of the Sponsored Programs Administration, could not be reached for comment yesterday.The JEHT Foundation was established in 2000 to promote criminal and juvenile justice systems reform, to advocate the international rule of law, and to advance fair and competitive elections. “It’s so disappointing to see the Madoff scandal have an effect on a group like the JEHT Foundation, which was sponsoring numerous critically important human rights initiatives,” Giannini said in an e-mail.Over the years, JEHT has supported international organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International as well as human rights programs at major universities including Yale, Columbia, and Brandeis.The alleged Ponzi scheme run by Madoff has paralyzed a number of charitable organizations, including the Picower Foundation, which consequently terminated funding for a diabetes research project at Harvard Medical School in December.—Staff writer Weiqi Zhang can be reached at wzhang@fas.harvard.edu.

It’s been a season of tough bounces, bad luck, and lost chances for the Harvard women’s hockey team.
Last night against No. 8 Dartmouth at Bright Hockey Center, the Crimson missed yet another opportunity, this one to take first place in the ECAC and start its climb back into the national rankings.
Harvard (6-7-3, 6-4-2 ECAC) fell, 3-0, to the Big Green (9-5-2, 7-3-2), ceding sole possession of the top spot in the conference to Dartmouth and suffering another setback in what has been a trying season.
The Crimson jumped out of the gate quickly, swarming the Big Green net and dominating possession of the puck for the first half of the opening period.
But Harvard could not break through, failing to capitalize on a power play opportunity and coming up short despite peppering Dartmouth goalie Carli Clemis with shots.
“It’s hard [not to score] when you sustain that much pressure,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “They literally didn’t get into our zone for almost 10 minutes.”
The Big Green finally got its chance against the Harvard defense when sophomore Kate Buesser went to the penalty box on a hooking charge.
Dartmouth made the most of its man advantage when center Jenna Cunningham slammed the puck home from in front of the net on a bang-bang play 13:19 into the first period. 
“It was a little bit of a letdown,” Stone said. “There are swings in momentum and that was one of them.”
One goal was enough, but the Big Green built on its opening tally and took the offensive. With just over two minutes left in the first frame, Harvard goaltender Brittany Martin attempted to clear the puck out of the Crimson zone, but inadvertently found the stick of Dartmouth defenseman Sarah Newnam. Newnam hammered a slapshot towards the net, and teammate Alyssa Boehm got a piece of the puck, deflecting it past Martin to give the Big Green a 2-0 lead.
Dartmouth added one more goal with 7:36 left in the second period. Newnam whipped an outlet pass to Marley McMillan, who found herself on a 2-on-1 break with Cunningham. McMillan charged the left side of the net, redirecting the puck at the last moment to Cunningham who nailed home the score for her second goal of the game and seventh of the season.
The assist was Newnam’s third on the night, giving her a helping hand in each of the Big Green’s goals.
“They’re talented players,” said Harvard tri-captain Jenny Brine of Cunningham and Newnam. “When it comes down to it, they were getting the bounces and finding the holes when we couldn’t.” 
For the Crimson’s part, the effort was there but the shots weren’t falling. Harvard attacked the net from all angles, but nothing seemed to work. Crimson co-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, a sleight-of-hand specialist with outstanding stick-handling ability, pulled out all the stops, but every juke resulted in a tipped puck and every nifty pass just barely eluded its intended receiver.
“We weren’t getting the bounces tonight, which was disappointing,” Brine said. “It’s kind of been the theme of the season.”
Then there was Dartmouth’s goalie.
Harvard took aim at Clemis on 31 occasions, but the Big Green netminder put up an impenetrable front. Clemis made several outstanding stops, sprawling across the ice to turn away all of the Crimson’s advances.
“My hat’s off to their goaltender,” Stone said. “She was tremendous. She won the game for them.”
In Harvard’s net, Martin was solid with 31 saves of her own in her final game in place of the Crimson’s normal starter, junior Christina Kessler. 
But Clemis, and Dartmouth, was better, and Harvard left the ice still trying to find the winning formula that has so far eluded it this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s offense ran into a brick wall last night, and her name was Carli Clemis.
Although the Dartmouth netminder was peppered by 31 shots, Clemis turned them all away.
“Goaltenders are keeping teams in the game,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “We’re getting the chances, we just need to find the back of the net.”
This inability to convert on offense has become a recurring trend for Harvard.
 In the squad’s last three games, the Crimson has averaged a whopping 36 shots per game while being shut out twice.
Harvard had no shortage of opportunities last night, with 15 shots in the first period alone, but the team was unable to light the lamp.
“We had plenty of chances, we just have to get better at burying them—burying the first chances and getting the second ones,” Stone said.
The Crimson has been ineffective on the power play of late, converting just one of its last 18 opportunities. 
And the team is even less productive when playing from behind. While Harvard is 5-0-2 when it scores first, the squad holds a 1-7-1 record when its opponent grabs the opening goal.
The Crimson will need to rediscover its offensive firepower if it hopes to make a run for the ECAC title in the second half of the season. While Harvard ranks fifth in the conference in scoring defense, it is a disappointing eighth in scoring offense.
“You have to make your own luck,” Stone said. 
“I think we’re at a point now where we’re playing really hard, and we’re getting some opportunities,” she added.
BACK IN CRIMSON
One bright spot in last night’s game was the return of tri-captain Jenny Brine, who had missed the last three games with an injury.
“It was great to be back out there,” she said.
Brine had five shots in her return and saw plenty of ice time both at even strength and on special teams.
She was back on the first line with classmates Sarah Vaillancourt and Sarah Wilson, a line that has been extremely productive for the Crimson all season. 
Last night, the three seniors combined for 17 of Harvard’s 31 shots, a percentage consistent with their typical offensive contributions.
The linemates are Harvard’s top three scorers and account for half of the Crimson’s points on the season.
“I thought our line played pretty well out there tonight,” Brine said. “A few passes were a little off, but overall I’m pleased.”
For a team that has been battered by injuries of late, Brine’s return is crucial.
Harvard is still missing its top defenseman, junior Cori Bassett, who sustained an injury in the Crimson’s first matchup with the Big Green last month. While her return date is still uncertain, starting goaltender Christina Kessler will rejoin the team this weekend after spending the last week fulfilling her duties with the Canadian U-22 team. Kessler made 35 saves in two shutout appearances, helping her team to a silver medal at the MLP Cup in Germany, which ended last night.
“We want everybody back in the lineup,” Stone said. “The exam break comes at a good time for us. We hope we can get healthy and do some damage in February.”
BASH SISTERS
In what proved to be a very physical game, it wasn’t surprising that Harvard was called for six penalties last night.
The Crimson was whistled three times for illegal hits, the most blatant of which came late in the second period.
Right after freshman Whitney Kennedy’s penalty expired, there was a scuffle in front of the Harvard net.
After Crimson goalie Brittany Martin was roughed up by Dartmouth’s Amanda Trunzo, Vaillancourt stepped in to defend her teammate.
Both skaters were put in the box for hitting after the whistle.
“There’s never a good time, but by the same token, you’ve got to be smart about protecting your goaltender and not letting someone take advantage of you,” Stone said.
Harvard had a solid night on the penalty kill, shutting the Big Green down in its last three power-play chances.
The Crimson was able to limit Dartmouth’s opportunities in a 5-on-3 situation in the third period and generated some shorthanded chances of its own.
