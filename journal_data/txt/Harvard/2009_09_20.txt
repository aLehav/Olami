After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Herrell’s Ice Cream, the Harvard Square sweet-tooth haven famous for “Herrell’s dollars” and apple pie à la mode, has announced that it will close its doors after 27 years of service. And while its management plans to reinvent the space as a casual dining establishment that will still serve some ice cream, it’s a sad day whenever such a deeply rooted institution is forced to close, regardless of the reasons why.  
On the subject of reasons, however, there is an interesting twist to the demise of Herrell’s—one that isn’t necessarily explained by rising operating costs or the strain of the recession. Apparently, JP Licks, a competing ice-cream vendor that opened in a strategic Mass. Ave. location last summer, benefitted from financial incentives offered by Harvard University. The university owns the real estate JP Licks currently occupies, and it essentially invited the franchise in, offering the popular Boston-area chain preferential access to the space and a lease at a below-market rate. To some, such incentives smack of the sort of anti-competitive practices that have no place in a free-market system.  
But these objections ignore the fact that Harvard does own the real estate it currently leases to JP Licks and has the right to bring in the tenants it wants. As a university, Harvard has a vested interest in leasing to businesses that together can provide a certain type of collegiate community geared toward the interests and needs of students. The university clearly judged that JP Licks was one of those businesses, and, as much as we have appreciated Herrell’s service over the past three decades, we have no complaint about the role Harvard may have played in its demise. (And, while we appreciate Harvard’s interest in the well-being of the Harvard Square community when choosing its tenants, it would be nice to see the same interest relayed across the river in Allston where the university currently owns a number of properties in anticipation of construction.) 
Still, we were curious about the particular decision to bring in JP Licks as opposed to all the other options Harvard might have explored. The statements from university real-estate officials who claimed that encouraging JP Licks to come into the Square was in line with their “commitment to local businesses that bring a unique and quality product” seemed odd. After all, while JP Licks is a local business with a quality product, so is Herrell’s, which has offered the same product for 27 years. If Harvard is truly committed to local businesses with “unique” products, why bring in one that serves a virtually identical function as another? 
While those sorts of questions will linger, the unfortunate bottom line is that Herrell’s is closing soon, possibly by November. Its unique approach to ice cream will surely be missed, and we encourage our readers to savor its treats while they still can.

As the 2010 Census approaches, state governments will be looking to redraw congressional district lines to reflect the recent populations of the past 10 years. But even adjusting for these population shifts, the size of each congressional district will still be highly variable, with both Montana’s population of 958,000 people and Wyoming’s 523,000 people each represented by one member in the House. A federal court challenge set to be filed in Mississippi on Thursday alleges that the 400,000-person disparity disenfranchises people living in certain states. They call for the House to increase its size to anywhere from 932 to 1,761 members in order to create districts that are of roughly equal population size.
Looking at these numbers, it does seem unjust that the House of Representatives, a body founded on the principle of proportional representation, should give some citizens so much more voting power than others—a person’s vote in Montana counts for a little more than half that of a voter in Wyoming.
However, the proposal to dramatically expand the size of the House would ultimately generate more problems than it would fix. At its current size of 435 members, the House is already slow and inefficient, and doubling its size would only exacerbate these problems. Increasing the size of the House to 1,000 members would make the already protracted process of lawmaking even longer.
Furthermore, a larger number of representatives with smaller constituencies and narrower interests would increase the potential for pork-barrel spending and inefficiency. Members of the House, in order to curry favor with their constituencies, generally try to direct federal funding toward their own districts through earmarks in legislation. It follows that having more representatives would likely result in increased spending on numerous projects that are not of national significance. Whatever gains in equity are achieved by expansion would be overwhelmed by losses in effectiveness.
Finally, it is worth noting that, to find the most striking source of unequal representation, one would need look no further than the Senate, which grants tremendously disproportionate voting power to inhabitants of small states. While this system is highly unlikely to change, given that it would require a constitutional amendment to do so, we would contend that the inequality it generates is far more pronounced and troubling than that of inconsistent House congressional districts.
Concern over disproportionate representation is warranted and well received. Drastically expanding the House, however, is not the appropriate solution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Friday, and the sun has set. You assess the options: Head to a sweaty rager in your blockmate’s teammate’s best friend’s sister’s suite, sneak into a party at the Advocate (of which you are not a member), go straight to the Kong, or cuddle up in bed with your Ec 10 textbook. No matter what you choose, you’ll likely remain close to home. Come to think of it, when was the last time you left Cambridge on a weekend night? In my case, at least, I can’t even remember.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is partly responsible for our insular tendencies. We live in a metropolitan area that’s home to over 80 private colleges and universities—not to mention the public ones. With teeming students on every street corner (360,000 at private institutions alone), it seems like common sense for the city to cater to this younger crowd. And often it does. But when it comes to public transportation, the T’s operational hours serve as an added obstacle to inter-collegiate activities and friendships. At the mere suggestion of heading downtown, someone always mentions the cab fare back—and after that, it’s usually a moot point.
In New York City, where 24 subway lines create a complex web across the boroughs, riders can hop aboard the F train at 4:10 a.m.—every weekday. Anyone stuck on Canal Street at sunrise could likewise catch the Q and subterraneously shoot across the city toward bed. But find yourself at Park St. in downtown Boston on a Sunday morning post-12:47 a.m., and there’s no boarding the Red Line back to Harvard Square. Unless you want to wait until 6:18 a.m.
In a state still subject to “blue laws”—legislative relics of the colonial era—it isn’t surprising that the Puritan vibe carries over to the subway system. Boston and Cambridge bars close by 2 a.m., which leaves seemingly little reason to stay out late. That is, unless you’re 20, and your night doesn’t start until 11:30 p.m. at the earliest. With college campuses smattered from Davis Square to Chestnut Hill to Waltham, there’s ample opportunity for a vibrant, energetic student scene: riveting discussions in smoky Berklee dorm rooms, raging techno raves at BU. Instead, young people brimming with intellectual curiosity and social energy collect in the same city, only to remain separate on their own college grounds. Of course, there’s a good chance campus-hopping does occur—maybe BC students trek to Northeastern every weekend—but those of us across the Charles simply don’t know about it.
And therein lies the crux of the issue. Extending the T’s weekend operating hours will do nothing unless there’s a demand for the service. The real question, then: If Harvard students aren’t making the effort, are we actually interested in talking or watching a movie or drinking or dancing with our peers on other campuses? As we all know, the Harvard bubble isn’t easy to pop. It’s possible that remaining in this slice of Cambridge seems simpler, where the perceived prestige of our institution doesn’t lead to uncomfortable conversations or awkward moments after someone drops the H-bomb. An alternative, less flattering explanation: Maybe Harvard people simply don’t have much interest in the rest of the population.
Whether the Square’s insular nature stems from arrogance or mere laziness doesn’t change the fact that we always have a choice. If the mere thought of walking from the River to the Quad deters many from making the trip, then it’s no wonder that traveling across town is an anomaly. It’s time to get off our futons and find out what this city has to offer. Maybe if we take to the cobblestoned streets, the MBTA will notice the change and act accordingly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twelve nights ago, President Obama showcased the best of political poise and pose: He reaffirmed the moral purpose of health-care reform and at the same time committed to a civil debate on best practices. His graceful diplomacy was welcome solace in a period of shameless pandering. 
But, above all, the president’s careful choice of words reflects a hard truth about his audience: In many ways Americans are beginning to remember the imperatives of confronting social problems together, but we’re unsure of the role Washington should play.
The president knows this better than almost anyone. And nowhere do we see this knowledge at work more than in his careful positioning on the creation of a public option, a not-for-profit, government-run insurance provider. Although there is much to say about budget woes—and rightly so—discussion about a public option not only serves as the fulcrum for legislation, but also speaks volumes about the attitude of the country and where we’re headed.
The White House knows the public option is the most contentious piece of reform left on the table and is treading carefully. In the short run, the president knows he might have to barter the public option in order to gather centrist Democrat votes and pass the bill. In the long run, by endorsing but not demanding the public option, the president hopes he still might gradually restore faith in government as a force for good. 
Over the summer, public opinion on the public option only seemed to shift often and abruptly. Much of this confusion had to do with the wording of pollsters’ questions: When asked if they supported the inclusion of a “public option” in the health-care bill, respondents answered affirmatively about 65 percent of the time and negatively about 35 percent of the time. When asked if they supported the inclusion of a “government option” in the health-care bill (with the same details listed), these numbers would then change drastically, even reverse.
This is an important trend to note. 
Even though there is now a wide public consensus that a universal health-insurance bill should pass, there seems to be little faith in the ability of Washington to be the vehicle of change. We can attribute much of this to two phenomena: classic, philosophical mistrust in the government and the financial firepower of special-interest lobbies. 
The roots of Reaganism run deep, and those against a government-sponsored plan shout loudest. People who do want to expand coverage and cut costs—and quite possibly truly want to help their fellow citizens—are still hesitant to support the expansion of Washington’s influence in the market. In many ways, the invisible hand is strangling the Democratic Party. A big part of the president’s speech aimed to convince insured Democrats with market-friendly perspectives that a government-run public option could work, while also convincing progressives that although the letter of reform may change, the spirit remains the same. 
Yet the most difficult part of the president’s balancing act is between the needs and desires of constituents and the pressures of organized money. Health-industry lobbyists  have done much to fan the flames of mistrust in the government these past few months.
The president needs the votes of Blue Dog Democrats who have received hefty health-industry contributions. Interestingly, Nate Silver—the infamous election pollster of website 538—has found that in 34 of 52 Blue Dog Democrat districts, a plurality of constituents now support the policy. The Blue Dogs don’t need a graceful way to cover themselves from their constituents’ backlash so much as they need to maintain the loyalty of their campaign contributors.
For the foreseeable future, Blue Dog Democrats—not to mention party-line Republicans—continue to falsely claim that a public option is against the will of the people. It is an unfortunate reality with which the president and the rest of the Democratic Party will have to deal.
There are many options for compromise on the table—including Republican Senator Olympia Snowe’s widely touted “triggered public option” plan. Overall, it remains likely a bill will pass. If we are to take the president at his word, we will ultimately choose whichever plan achieves the prize: passing a bill that covers everyone and begins to lower costs—even if the public option must be swapped for votes.
In some liberal circles, this kind of political finesse, rather than a confrontational approach, seems unacceptable. They would argue this policy only offers the Republicans more room to drum up their misleading excuses for selfishness. 
From another perspective, one which I generally tend to agree with more, President Obama is now doing quite gracefully what many during the campaign feared he could not: He is playing the savvy realist, and not only in terms of maneuvering legislation. The president’s approach may produce an imperfect bill—but it is more likely to return trust in Washington than a stubborn strategy that would produce no bill at all.

Two important national anniversaries passed recently: 9/11, of course, and 8/29, the date that Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005. I hope it won’t seem crass, but I think there are important lessons to learn from those terrible days. 
It is clear that the federal government failed to respond effectively to either immediate crisis. But on 9/11 it was for lack of ability, while on 8/29 it was for lack of proper planning and execution. Understood together, the events of 9/11 and 8/29 point to a new conception of national defense: one less obsessed with speedy anti-terror response, which, as on 9/11, will often fail or prove untenable, and more focused on basic, boring competence in those areas where governmental action really is plausible and necessary. 
When it comes to protecting ourselves from terrorist attacks, we tend to romanticize about scrambling fighter pilots, rapidly deployed interceptive missiles, and secret agents pulling a Jack Bauer to save thousands of lives. As Professor Elaine Scarry has written, these notions go hand in hand with counterterrorism policies where major decisions are rushed (just 24 hours to save us, Jack!) and a handful of officials make them in secret, where torture is justified by the need for speed and preventive detention by simple expedience. 
But what if all of this governmental hastiness doesn’t get us anywhere? After all, the only effective national defense that took place on 9/11 was bottom-up rather than top-down: the passengers who took back United Flight 93. The fighter jets could not scramble fast enough, and we may not have wanted them to: Who decides to shoot down a passenger plane, and what criteria does he or she use? We must stop assuming that we face a choice between heroic governmental protection from terrorism and no protection at all. At least with regard to airborne terror (remember also the “shoe bomber,” foiled by passengers and crew), vigilant citizens may be the only defense we have and need. 
The implications for national policy should be drawn out: If the government could not protect the Pentagon with roughly an hour’s notice, maybe we should not let it abrogate the rule of law in the name of rapid and effective national defense. If our hair-trigger responses could not stop the hijackers, maybe we should slow things down and focus on wisdom rather than speed. We now know that decisions made rashly in the aftermath of 9/11 (spying on citizens, torturing suspects, detaining without trial men of unproven guilt) were of dubious effectiveness. Just as significantly, no obvious danger would have ensued if we had made those decisions together, through public deliberation over the course of days and weeks. We didn’t know all of this in 2001, so some deference is due. But we know now that citizens should be allowed to take responsibility for their national security in all situations, not just in dire ones like on Flight 93.
Four years after 9/11, we saw governmental incompetence of a different sort, the outcome of neither logistical impossibilities nor ethical quandaries. The various levels of government faced Katrina unprepared and failed to think on their feet. Dithering by local, state, and federal officials caused unnecessary damage and loss of life, a House Select Committee concluded. FEMA was “under-trained and under-staffed” and became “overwhelmed” by the crisis, evacuation plans were put into effect far too late, and “sparse or conflicting information was used as an excuse” for doing nothing.  
This is not what one would expect from officials who believed that responding to natural disasters is one of the most important and unique functions of government. It’s not what one would expect from people who realized that only a huge entity like the state can perform the monumental tasks involved in an ongoing humanitarian crisis: providing helicopters and boats for rescue efforts; soldiers for security; food, water, and housing for hundreds of thousands of people. The idea of citizen responsibility that is so key to anti-terror protection is almost meaningless when we’re talking about projects of this scale. 
It is painful to revisit these national tragedies, but we need to face up to their lessons. When disaster threatens the country, the appropriate response depends on the type of disaster at hand. When the threat is from a few evil men and the country has only minutes to respond, perhaps only individuals in the moment can effectively act. But when the threat is God-sent, only the most God-like entity we have is up to the task. We should recalibrate our governmental institutions, and our cultural intuitions, accordingly.

Mass. Congressman Michael E. Capuano formally announced his bid for the vacant Senate seat of the late Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 at the Omni Parker Hotel in Boston last Friday. The six-term congressman represents the 8th Congressional District of Massachusetts, which is comprised of Cambridge, Somerville, Boston, and Chelsea. He joins the race against fellow democrats Attorney General Martha Coakley, Boston Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Boston Celtics owner Stephen G. Pagliuca, and City Year co-founder Alan Khazei ’83. State Senator Scott P. Brown and Canton Selectman Robert Burr are seeking the republican nomination. In his opening speech, Capuano praised Kennedy’s long years of service to Mass. politics and said he would announce his entrance into the senate race “with the greatest respect for [Kennedy’s] legacy.” Capuano called himself the only candidate in the race who is “ready to champion the same progressive ideals that Senator Kennedy fought so long for,” and warned against those seeking to steer the senate in a more conservative direction. Aligning himself with the former senator’s views on war, the struggling economy, and health care, Capuano also stressed his position as a seasoned politician who already has extensive legislative experience. Capuano was introduced by fellow Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, who also emphasized Capuano’s close mirroring of Kennedy’s voting record. Frank added that while the US recently lost the “greatest senator in history,” Capuano is the ideal candidate to continue his legacy. “Michael [Capuano] has a sustained, principled irreverence, and I cannot think of anything the United States Senate needs more at this time,” said Frank. Claiming that neither of the current challengers for the democratic nomination adequately represented Kennedy’s liberal values, both Capuano and Frank criticized early frontrunner Martha Coakley for dodging controversial issues such as the Iraq War and drawing attention to Steven Pagliuca’s friendship with Republican Mitt Romney. Capuano has previously served as Mayor of his hometown of Somerville. He is currently chairman of the Sub-Committee on Capitol Security, and a member of the House Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure, Financial Services, and House Administration. His senate-bid announcement was crowded by press from both local and national outlets. Ted Kennedy’s death on August 25th piqued media interest in the problem of succession, including whether Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 would be allowed to appoint an interim senator before formal elections are held. The democratic primary will take place December 8 this year and general elections on January 19 in 2010. Alison Mills, Capuano’s press secretary, could not be reached for comment. —Staff writer Shan Wang can be reached at wang38@fas.harvard.edu.

MIT announced last week that the size of its endowment fell by roughly 21 percent this past fiscal year—substantially better than the 30 percent declines reported by Harvard and Yale only a few days earlier. In the year ending June 30, the MIT endowment generated an investment loss of 17.1 percent. When combined with the $518 million paid out for operations and the $143 million received in gifts and transfers, the endowment’s total value fell from $10.1 billion to $8 billion. MIT’s endowment outperformed its peers this past year. According to investment consulting firm Wilshire Associates the median large endowment this past year generated an investment loss of roughly 18 percent. “Investments in the fixed income, marketable alternative, real asset, and real estate arenas helped offset significant declines in public and private equity portfolios,” the MIT press release stated. According to its Web site, MIT has laid off 105 employees since January and has left 90 other open job positions unfilled to meet budget reductions. The diversified, aggressive investment strategies of schools such as Harvard and Yale typically bring greater returns, but those strategies were less fruitful this year. While the University of Pennsylvania invested heavily in government bonds and achieved investment losses of only roughly 16 percent, Harvard, with its large investments in hedge funds and private equity, reported a 27.3 percent loss. With gifts and payout, that loss translated to an $11 billion decrease in Harvard’s endowment—an amount greater than the total value of any other school’s endowment except Yale, Princeton, and Stanford. The value of Harvard’s endowment now stands at $26 billion, roughly the same level it was at in 2005. MIT’s statement also noted that its endowment has generated an annualized return of 9.3 percent over the past 10 years—slightly better than Harvard’s 10-year annualized return of 8.9 percent. —Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard Allston Partnership Fund, which will award a total of $500,000 in grants to neighborhood nonprofit organizations over five years, began accepting its second round of applications this month. After a delay that caused the first application period to occur in April 2009 rather than 2008, the program has resumed its schedule to distribute $100,000 each year to nonprofit organizations until 2012, as part of the $25 million in benefits that Harvard agreed to give the Allston community in order to proceed with construction of its Allston Science Complex. The grants benefit initiatives focused on health, education, and neighborhood improvement. Earlier this year, six local nonprofits, including a community health center and a poetry outreach project, were awarded grants by the eight voting members of the Fund Committee. Paul Berkeley, who is a member of the mayor-appointed group, said that he thought the grant program’s initial round had been successful. He added that in this second round, the Fund would again target groups that deliver services or programs benefiting the North Allston-Brighton community—the area most impacted by Harvard’s institutional expansion. Ray Mellone, another member of the Committee, said that he and his colleagues would look to simplify the “intimidating” application process and grant paperwork, which he said may have deterred some groups from participating last spring. “Grant writing is not the forte of a lot of these small nonprofits,” he said. Mellone added that roughly 40 groups had applied for grants in the first round, and that he expected a similar number of applicants this fall. According to the Partnership Fund’s Web site, grant proposals are due Oct. 15, and recipients will be announced in December. Technical assistance sessions will be offered in September and October to help organizations fill out the two types of applications—one for grants up to $5,000, and one for grants up to $25,000. Harvard, which announced in February that it would be slowing construction of its much-heralded Allston Science Complex, has come under fire from local residents who fear that the University is abandoning its institutional plans for the neighborhood in light of fiscal troubles. But Kevin A. McCluskey ’76, Harvard’s director of community relations for Boston, said that the University has “made a commitment to the provision of community benefits regardless of our [development] timetable.” —Staff writer Michelle L.

WORCESTER, Mass.—The most important play in Harvard’s Saturday matchup with Holy Cross came on a fourth down, and it wasn’t junior receiver Chris Lorditch’s 45-yard touchdown reception that brought the Crimson within seven points late in the final quarter.The pivotal moment in the contest came after the Harvard offense responded to a Crusader run of 20 unanswered points with a touchdown of its own. Relying on junior tailback Gino Gordon for the majority of the grunt work, the Crimson marched 67 yards down field and planted the ball in the Crusader’s endzone—bringing the score to 20-13 as Holy Cross fans with shirts declaring “God is on our side” looked on in rapt dismay. After Holy Cross went three-and-out, Harvard’s squad looked ready to cross the pylons for a second time in the quarter as it assembled a 49-yard drive. When the offensive machine stalled out on the Holy Cross 15, Harvard coach Tim Murphy passed on the field goal and instead opted to give Gordon the ball in a fourth-and-three situation.“I didn’t feel great about where we were for a field goal,” Murphy said. “We wanted to try to get something done there. We needed seven points to win the game.”Gordon pushed forward, hitting a wall of linemen. As he struggled to make a hole in the fray, Crusader Marcus Rodriguez tackled the Crimson’s starting tailback to the ground, ending the drive.Harvard’s momentum was dealt a serious blow—as was Gordon.After taking his time to get up, Gordon left the field with his teammates’ help. He reappeared briefly at the end of the fourth quarter, contributing two yards in as many carries, but it was clear that some of the wind had been taken of Gordon, as well as the Crimson offense.RUNNING ON EMPTYAside from the Gordon-anchored touchdown drive in the third quarter, Harvard struggled to establish a solid run game.Despite earning only two yards in the fourth quarter, Gordon led the Crimson’s rushing front with 67 yards and a touchdown.With Gordon out of the game, freshman Treavor Scales took the reins. Forced to step up, the rookie contributed 11 yards in the fourth after running for 20 on five carries in the previous three quarters. Scales showed promise but could not comprise an effective run game by himself.“He’s a tough kid—poised,” Murphy said. “We didn’t do a good enough job in the running game today to beat a good football team.”Without a reliable run game, Harvard fell back on junior quarterback Collier Winters in his first start behind center to provide the bulk of the offense.“The first game is difficult to come out and be hitting on all cylinders with everybody,” Winters said.Winters scrambled for 40 yards throughout the game, good for the second highest in rushing for the Crimson.Senior Cheng Ho had a cameo in the final quarter, taking the field once and amassing eight yards.ROUGH HOUSINGThe pleasantries normally exchanged between friends who see each other but once a year were lost somewhere on the field in Saturday’s contest. The Crusaders strutted into the third contest of their season ready to fight, and the Crimson did not shy away from showing emotion in the game, either.Heated sentiments were exchanged throughout the game and continued to boil even into the final seconds when a scuffle nearly broke out between the opposing lines.The most quantifiable embodiment—and perhaps source, as well—of the players’ emotions came in the form of several defensive infractions against Holy Cross.Penalties were a frequent source of discontent on the Crusader bench; Holy Cross was set back 120 yards on 10 penalties relative to 50 yards of lost ground on six Harvard penalties. But it was a series of roughing the passer calls that ignited attitudes throughout Fitton Field.The first came early in the game when a Crusader was charged with using his head as a weapon. The call nullified a three-yard loss and gave the Crimson a boost in its first drive. Cries arose from purple-clad players and coaching staff alike as Harvard marched its way up field 15 yards en route to an eventual touchdown.Holy Cross faced similar charges twice more in the half, although the ensuing outrage from the home sideline and fans was not further provoked, since Harvard failed to score on both of those drives.—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

WORCESTER, Mass.—There are few archetypical plots in American sports culture more beloved than the underdog story. Jesse Owens sprinting to glory in defiance of Hiter’s Nazi regime. An amateur ragtag United States hockey team dismantling a polished Soviet machine with a miracle. Rocky Balboa.These are the tales that capture the American sports fan’s imagination most vividly, and yet their appeal lies in their scarcity. David rarely beats Goliath.This was made all too clear in the Harvard football team’s 27-20 loss to Holy Cross on Saturday in Worcester, Mass. On one side, there was junior Collier Winters, the Crimson’s new starting signal caller, a scrappy scrambler listed at 5’11 and 190 pounds who hadn’t thrown a ball in a college game. On the other, there was senior Dominic Randolph, the Crusaders’ 6’3, 233-pound juggernaut of a quarterback, the two-time defending Patriot League Player of the Year with a cannon for an arm and implausible mobility for a man of his size.It was a lopsided matchup, one that Harvard couldn’t win, so the Crimson tried to prevent it from being the focal point of the game. For most of the game, Winters was confined to screen plays and short passes while Harvard tried to establish its running attack. The Crimson also attempted to keep Randolph from breaking out by pestering him with an extra player rushing into the backfield and sticking his receivers with man coverage.Neither strategy was as effective as Harvard would have liked. Junior Gino Gordon and rookie Treavor Scales had modest success running the ball for the Crimson, and Winters occasionally caught Holy Cross off-guard with designed quarterback run plays and improvised scrambles. But for the most part, the Crusaders kept Harvard’s ground game in check. On defense, the Crimson had trouble breaking through a stalwart Holy Cross offensive line, and while the Harvard defensive backs played solidly, even the tiniest of openings was enough for Randolph to thread the needle and hit his intended receiver.In the end, it came down to Winters vs. Randolph. David vs. Goliath.And for a moment, it appeared that the underdog might pull it out.Nearly midway through the fourth quarter, the Crimson was down, but not out, trailing 20-13. But after a quick three-and-out, Harvard gave the ball to Holy Cross at its own 45-yard line with 11:12 left to go in the game.That was all Randolph needed. On the first play of the drive, Randolph launched a pretty, arching pass to Gerald Mistretta down the left sideline. Mistretta hauled in the catch and sauntered into the endzone to give the Crusaders a commanding 27-13 advantage.But Harvard and Winters were not done yet. On the ensuing drive, the Crimson worked quickly and effectively, mixing the run and pass well to move up to the Crusaders’ 46. From nearly the same spot where Randolph had just seemingly crushed Harvard’s aspirations for victory, Winters reached back to God knows where and unloaded a bomb down the right sideline. Junior receiver Chris Lorditch—Winters’ favorite target on the day, with nine receptions for 89 yards—turned on the burners and chased the pass down, pulling it in for a touchdown to bring the score to 27-20.The Crimson defense quickly got the ball back, giving Harvard one more possession to complete its comeback with 3:41 left, and the thought of asking Winters for a repeat performance didn’t seem entirely unreasonable.But there would be no underdog story, at least not the kind that people like to hear. Winters fumbled the ball away, and with it went the Crimson’s chance to win.In the context of this game, it’s impossible to look at Winters’ performance without looking at Randolph’s as well. On that front, there is no comparison. Winters completed 22 of 37 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns, while running for 40 yards on 11 tries. Not bad, but not Randolph. The Crusader went 25-for-39 with 293 yards and 2 touchdowns, and ran for 41 yards on just seven carries. Looking beyond the statistics, Randolph displayed a command of the field and a confidence in his throws that Winters couldn’t match. While Winters managed the Harvard offense, Randolph directed his.But in a broader sense, Saturday’s game left Harvard with plenty of reason for optimism regarding its new quarterback. Winters proved that he could handle the starting role, and if he can replicate his final line every game, the Crimson will be in great shape as it seeks its third-straight Ivy title.There’s also some more silver lining for Harvard—it’ll never see Randolph again, unless it’s on television, and the Ivy League is a conference with far more Davids than Goliaths at quarterback.—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, Mass.—The sport of football is a funny thing. On any given Saturday, it can giveth and it can taketh away. That was certainly the case for Harvard football this weekend, as it witnessed highs and lows before ultimately falling to Holy Cross (3-0), 27-20.“The bottom line is that we played hard, but they made a few more plays, and we made a few more mistakes,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “And that makes the difference in the game.”Harvard (0-1) got off to a hot start, marching down the field on its opening drive using a combination of short tosses from junior quarterback Collier Winters and short gains on the ground from both Winters and junior running back Gino Gordon. When Winters ultimately connected with Gordon for a five-yard touchdown pass, the Crimson offensive line returned to the bench with not only six points on the board, but also significant time off the game clock. The opening drive controlled four and a half minutes of play.A missed extra point by senior Patrick Long held Harvard’s score at six. But when the Crusader offense took over—led by three-time captain and two-time Patriot League Player of the Year Dominic Randolph—the momentum instantly shifted over to the home team. Though Holy Cross was unable to get anything done in its opening possession, Randolph showed he could pick apart the Crimson defense.“They’re a tough offense,” captain Carl Ehrlich said. “We knew it was a tough offense coming in.”And though Harvard controlled the clock in the first possession, the Crimson ended the first quarter with just 6:57 of possession time to the Crusaders’ 8:03.Just before time expired in the first frame, Randolph hit Nick Cole for a 21-yard touchdown pass. Harvard had held the advantage for the larger part of the quarter, but after Rick Dornfried’s successful extra point attempt, Holy Cross took a lead that it would not relinquish.Midway through the second period, Randolph exhibited his versatility, taking the ball himself up the middle for a one-yard sneak, resulting in another Crusader score.Holy Cross added some insurance to start the second half. Running back Matt Bellomo, who finished the day with only 37 yards on 10 carries, picked up his longest rush of the day, punctuating a 10-yard run with another Crusader touchdown. But a missed extra point from Dornfried kept the score at 20-6.Down by two touchdowns, Collier Winters and the Harvard offense looked to close the gap. But with the Holy Cross’s best cornerback Michael Wright matched up against senior Matt Luft, Winters’ targets were severely limited.“I thought we spread it around reasonably, but I think they did a good job against Luft,” Murphy said. “That was part of their game plan. They put their best guy on him. Sometimes they double covered him under the boundary. But the bottom line is predicated on what people give us and that’s what Collier tried to do today.”With just under eight minutes to play in the third frame, Harvard seemed to show signs of life again. Winters found a new favorite target in junior Chris Lorditch, while Gordon and rookie Treavor Scales shared time in the running game. Capping off the drive, Gordon punched it in from two yards out to pull the Crimson within seven.“Second-half protection was a lot better,” Winters said. “They kind of stopped blitzing, so that allowed us to get some time and get some routes downfield. When they were blitzing in the first half, they left a lot of holes underneath, so I just took what they gave us.”Then, with a quick three-and-out on defense, Winters drove deep into the red zone. Poised at the 15-yard line and staring at a fourth and three situation, Murphy decided to go for broke. But a handoff to Gordon, who drove up the middle, got shut down two yards short of moving the chains.“I just felt like their offense is good enough that you can’t guarantee that you’re going to get them off the field,” Murphy said. “I didn’t feel great about where we were for a field goal. We wanted to try to get something done there. We needed seven points to win the game.”In the final frame, Randolph again showed why he’s the two-time defending Conference Player of the Year. With just over 11 minutes to play, he connected with an open Gerald Mistretta, who completed the 45-yard touchdown pass. The whole series lasted only nine seconds, and the worn-down Harvard offense returned to the field needing to make up 14 points. And despite falling into another fourth-down situation—this time with 14 yards to go—Harvard again went for it, this time with a different result. Lorditch managed to beat his man, and Winters tagged him from 46 yards out for a touchdown.“Our receivers were a little mixed up,” Winters said. “We had Luft as a slot receiver, which he’s usually not. But it worked out good for us because it kept the safety in. He was kind of keying on Luft. The corner was peeking inside and Lorditch just ran by him. I saw him and just threw it up to him.”And though the Crimson defense contained Randolph for the rest of the game, Harvard was unable to capitalize on its final drive. After two short run gains, Winters was sent scrambling out of the pocket. Not finding an open man, the quarterback was hit from behind. The ball sprung free, and Holy Cross’s Alex Carson fell on it. Randolph and his offense were able to ride out the clock, sealing the 27-20 Crusader victory.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

This past Saturday, the Harvard men’s soccer team continued on its path of regional domination. Under the lights of Fairfield University’s Lessing Field, the No. 12 Crimson trampled the Stags, 4-1, and increased its winning streak to five for the season.While the final score implies an easy Harvard victory, the first half of the game left bystanders unsure of the eventual outcome. The visiting Crimson started out slow, firing off only four of its eight shots on goal during the first period. Fairfield was also contained offensively, registering only a quarter of their total shots in the first 45 minutes.However, things began to heat up for Harvard in the 32nd minute of play, under the leadership of standout co-captain Andre Akpan. The Grand Prairie, Texas native fired an unassisted rocket into the Stags’ net, recording the only goal of the first period standstill.“We battled a team that sat in and defended with a lot of numbers,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “It took us a lot of time to break them down, but we were patient and it paid off.”The real reward for the Crimson came after Akpan’s goal. Harvard continued to wear down its Connecticut opponent, and unleashed a torrent of offensive fury following the half.“The second 45 minutes we clearly were the better team,” Clark added.Akpan—who leads Harvard in points, goals scored, assists, shots, and game winning goals—stepped up again in the beginning of the second half, registering an assist at 56:12. The senior set up freshman sensation Brian Rogers, who recorded his third goal in crimson and white.The Crimson’s two-goal margin was increased once again by Akpan exactly three minutes later, on an assist from junior Rob Millock. The combined scoring effort marks Millock’s second assist of the year.“Andre keeps scoring goals,” Clark said. “He keeps getting on the end of things—in the second half, he was very active and look[ed] good.”Harvard continued its offensive barrage on a physically defeated Fairfield defense, racking up its fourth and final goal of the night late in the second half. Junior Tsiu Moorosi drove a pass to freshman Zack Wolfenzon, who found the Stags’ net with only eight minutes remaining in the game.“Today, we were really patient, and we were feeling the game out,” said co-captain and midfielder Brian Grimm. “We were able to...play a pretty good second half which gave us the win.”Harvard’s win was also bolstered by its consistently solid defense, including sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms, who registered one save on the night.The Crimson back line did let in a solitary Fairfield goal, at 83:57 from the Stags’ Jack Burridge on a Kwadwo Asante assist.But Clark was unconcerned about this minor stain on the otherwise spotless Harvard performance.“We’re not giving up many goals,” Clark said. “We gave up our goal with ten minutes to go, and the game was already over.”Grimm echoed the sentiments of his coach, signifying the strength of his team’s defensive effort.“It was another team effort where the back six played particularly well, continuing the defensive games we’ve been having,” Grimm said.—Staff writer Alexandra J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two difficult games, the Harvard men’s water polo team was able to bring home a victory, allowing them to take ninth on the last day of the 2009 ECAC Championships at DeNunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J. 
The Crimson (3-8, 1-0 CWPA Northern Division) faced tough competition—falling 12-7 to George Washington Friday night and 8-4 to Fordham Saturday afternoon—but was able to pull it together by Sunday.
Harvard built momentum throughout the tournament, making improvements during each game. Despite the slow start, the Crimson was able to prove that the third time is a charm.
“Even though we had two tough first games, we were able to rally mentally,” junior co-captain Brett Voith said. “We were really able to turn around our performance and get us back on track of where we want to be heading into our league schedule.” 
“Overall it was a little bit disappointing,” added co-captain Egen Atkinson, “But I think the team is ready to move on to practice this week, change a couple of things, and get a win on Saturday.”
HARVARD 15, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 5
The Crimson was able to walk away from ECACs with a win Sunday morning against Connecticut College. After just one quarter, Harvard was in command, leading the Camels (0-3, 0-0 Northern Division) by a score of 4-1. The Crimson carried this momentum with them throughout the remaining quarters to finalize the 15-5 victory. 
Sophomore Kevin DiSilvestro had an outstanding performance, recording a team-best four goals. Junior John Kolb added a number of steals and a timely goal that boosted the Crimson to the lopsided win. Junior Alex Thompson also drew many ejections, creating a few of Harvard’s key scoring chances. 
Atkinson, Sophomore Mike Katzer, and Thompson each netted two goals, while Voith, sophomores Luka Babic and Evan Zepfel, and freshmen Max Eliot added one score a piece. Eliot enjoyed another strong tournament, building on his Northern Division Rookie of the Week honors from last week.
“Today’s game…we came out and showed we were the stronger team early, and we were able to run our system effectively against them,” Atkinson said. 
FORDHAM 8, HARVARD 4
The Crimson came out with improved defense on Saturday afternoon but fell to Fordham for the second time this season. The Rams (6-6, 0-0 Northern Division) came out with a 4-1 lead over the Crimson. Harvard pulled within one point, sitting at 4-3, but the Rams seemed to find a rhythm and controlled the contest for the rest of the way, scoring four of the next five goals.
“We didn’t do a good job of executing our system on Saturday against Fordham and it showed,” Atkinson said.
Harvard was unable to capitalize on man-up chances, going 0-7 during 6-on-5 opportunities. The Crimson managed to get off 25 shots, but only four found the back of the net. Babic tallied two goals, while Atkinson and junior Jeff Lee chipped in with one goal each. 
The defense was a bit stronger than the offensive efforts, led by sophomore goalie Alexandre Popp. Harvard held Fordham in check for most of the contest, largely due to Popp’s nine saves.
GEORGE WASHINGTON 12, HARVARD 7
Friday evening, George Washington University got even with Harvard following last week’s Princeton Invitational by sending the Crimson to a 12-7 loss to open the tournament.
Although Harvard notched its first victory of the season against the Colonials (4-9, 0-0 Southern Division) just a week ago, this time The Crimson did not appear ready to compete at the tournament’s first whistle.
“As a team, we didn’t do a good job of preparing ourselves mentally to play against GW in the first game,” Atkinson said. 
Senior goalkeeper Nikhil Balaraman made seven saves, and senior Dan Furman, Thompson, Voith, DiSilvestro, and Eliot contributed to Harvard’s seven goals. 
The Crimson endured what would continue to be a weekend-long struggle to make the most of man-up opportunities, finishing the game 2-for10 in 6-on-5 situations. 
“In the first game, we really didn’t bring the intensity that we’d been bringing to practice on the daily basis and that showed,” Voith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team had a tough weekend in Durham, N.H., where it traveled for the Holly Young Invitational tournament. The Crimson (3-7) faced solid competition in Arizona State, New Hampshire, and Wyoming. Harvard was only able to come away with one victory in the tournament with its 3-1 defeat of New Hampshire.
WYOMING 3, HARVARD 1
The final match of the tournament proved to be a real battle between the Crimson and the Cowboys (8-5). Harvard started off strong in a competitive first set, winning 25-20, but the Cowboys rallied to win the final three sets 25-21, 25-23, 26-24. Throughout the match, there were 17 ties and eight lead changes.
Senior Lily Durwood led the way with 46 assists, nine digs, and four blocks. Durwood played well throughout the tournament, earning a spot on the all-tournament team. 
“Lily plays setter for us, which is a position with a natural role of leadership,” co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn said. “She always saves us and she fills that role naturally.”
Freshman Taylor Docter also put forth competitive efforts, setting her first collegiate double-double with 37 kills and 10 digs. “We really made a note to take care of simple technique things to prepare us very well for this tournament,” Docter said.
Junior Mikaelle Comrie and sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer also provided 13 and 11 strikes, respectively. Sophomore Christine Wu led all players defensively with 24 digs, while senior Alissa Flescher contributed eight kills and five blocks.
HARVARD 3, NEW HAMPSHIRE 1
In its first match on Saturday, the Crimson put forth a dominant effort against the Wildcats (4-9) to end a six-game losing streak. Comrie set the offensive tempo for the day, leading all players with 13 kills. Docter also had a big game offensively with 12 kills. UNH kept it close in the first set at 25-21 and won the second set 25-23 but the Crimson kept its momentum up and wiped out the Wildcats in the last two frames, 25-15, 25-18.
“We’ve gone into every single game with the mindset that we’re going to win...New Hampshire has always been a good matchup for us,” Ono Horn said.
Working off of each other, the women’s squad coalesced to produce a multi-faceted offense. Six Harvard players hit over .200, and the team combined for a clip of .221. Wu led all players with 21 digs and was complimented by Durwood, who was second on the team with 10 digs and 39 assists. Defensively, both Ono Horn and Fryhofer contributed four blocks. 
“[Ono Horn] and [Durwood] are so supportive,” Docter said. “They’re so competitive—they’ll hold you accountable for working hard and playing your best. They’re both such great leaders.”
As a team, the Crimson out-defended UNH, positng six blocks compared to the Wildcats’ one. Harvard also recorded 52 kills to the Wildcats’ 39 and 63 digs to the Wildcats’ 55.
ARIZONA STATE 3, HARVARD 0
In its first match of the weekend against Arizona State (10-2), the Crimson was unable to keep up with the Sun Devils. Harvard lost all three sets with scores of 25-16, 25-16, 25-7. 
The Crimson started out strong in the first set, keeping even with Arizona for the first several rounds of play. With the score at 12-10, Sun Devil Sarah Reaves delivered a kill that began a cascade of Arizona scoring. The Crimson could not match the pace, as the Sun Devils utilized 3-0 and 4-0 run to take a commanding lead. Harvard kept it close in the second set, with the score at 11-9 when a kill by Sun Devil Sofie Schlagintweit helped Arizona pull away to win the frame.
Fryhofer led the Crimson’s offensive front with eight kills in the match, along with a .350 hitting percentage. Comrie also contributed with seven kills of her own. Togehter, Fryhofer and Comrie had more kills than the rest of the team combined. 
Wu carried Harvard defensively with 18 digs, and Ono Horn added nine of her own along with two blocks.

Professor Michael J. Sandel is apparently becoming quite the media darling. Tomorrow, his lectures will be broadcast on public television for all the world to see. As of today, this week’s episode is already available on his snazzy new website. And last Thursday, he made an appearance on the Today Show—for all of four minutes—to discuss his new book, Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?.
Anchor Meredith Vieira wanted to know the answer to one main question: “So does philosophical reasoning have a place in modern life?”
Ponder this for a moment, then consider Sandel's response after the jump.
“Well, Socrates didn’t argue about Wall Street bailouts and health care and same sex marriage," he said. "These are the big questions about our political debates.  And just beneath the surfaces of the debates are the big questions of justice... big questions of philosophy.”
So, in a word, yup.
Vieira also went through a few of Sandel’s  famous hypothetical scenarios about trolley cars, starving sailors, and valuable flutes. By the end, though, she seemed to have had enough of these musings.
Sandel: He said justice was a matter of desert of honoring excellence, [music begins playing] the best flute player. And in a way, these debates, he didn’t argue about same sex marriage, in a way the question is—
Vieira: No debate here, we’ve run out of time!
Sandel: What—
Vieira: Sorry!
Sandel: [ignoring her] What should we honor as a community? [video gets cut off]
So much for philosophical public debates. Guess the one thing our community does honor is the time constraints of broadcast television.

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEW FACEBOOK MOVIE
Dear Hollywood,
So we heard that you’ve decided to make a movie about Facebook. Specifically, about how the social networking site grew from a little project hatched by a vindictive, fame-whoring computer genius into a global phenomenon with over 300 million active users.
(Special note to Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06-’07: Relax, Zuckerberg! We don’t actually think you’re the asshole that the script makes you out to be. Please don’t hack into our computer systems and/or steal our business venture ideas.)
Now, we at FlyBy are going to assume that you think this movie—which you’ve blandly titled The Social Network—is going to be a big hit. After all, you got Aaron Sorkin to write it. Insiders are apparently raving about it. You’re talking to Justin Timberlake about playing Napster founder Sean Parker.  But we at FlyBy just got a hold of the script, and frankly…well, we’ll tell you what we thought after the jump.
First, we understand that you’re in the moviemaking, not fact-checking, business, so we’ll let our quibbles about realism slide. But here’s one scene—a conversation between Mark and the undergrads who accused him of stealing the idea of Facebook from them—that made us wince:
Mark: Yeah. How’s this different from MySpace or Friendster?
Tyler: How?
Mark: Yeah.
Tyler: Harvard-dot-EDU.
Cameron: Harvard.edu. The most prestigious email address in the country.
Tyler: This site would be based on the idea that girls want to meet guys who go to Harvard. The difference between what we’re talking about and MySpace, Friendster—
Mark: —is exclusivity.
Ouch, way to make us all seem like elitist jerks! As if we didn’t do a good enough job of that ourselves. (By the way, we think you mean fas.harvard.edu.)
But okay. We’ll take criticism humbly, even when it comes in the form of tiresome stereotypes. Although, really, we swear we’re not all A) blazer-wearing rowers, B) Indians, C) slutty Asian girls, or D) computer geeks.
What we really want to know is how Zuckerberg is going to take this. In the script, right before he creates facemash.com (a sort of hotornot.com spinoff that was a precursor to Facebook), he muses, “The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. Billy Olson’s sitting here and had the idea of putting some of these girls’ faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who’s hotter….Good call, Mr. Olson! I think he’s on to something.”
Now that’s the kind of protagonist we’d root for! We bet the female half of the audience is really going to love him.
Granted, this appears in the beginning of the story, with plenty of time for Zuckerberg to redeem himself in a classic Hollywood feel-good about-face. But it never really materializes. The Zuckerberg we get here…
Mark: I’m saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the [final] clubs.
Erica: Why?
Mark: Because they’re exclusive. (beat) And fun and they lead to a better life.
…is roughly the Zuckerberg we get at the end. And that’s the main issue—the script sets him up as an underdog who fights against privilege to achieve a glittering rags-to-riches success, but his motivations seem so shallow (or, if we’re going to be kind, inscrutable) that we don’t really care.
Consider when Zuckerberg rails at Eduardo L. Saverin '05, Facebook's original CFO, who in this scene has just frozen the company's bank account (and at the moment is mildly preoccupied with a matter of life-and-death):
Mark: Do you get that?! I'm not going back to Caribbean night at the Jewish fraternity!
Eduardo: I've got a fire in my apartment!
Mark: Did you like being nothing?! Did you like being nobody?! Did you like being a pasty-faced geek?! You wanna go back to that?!
As Saverin struggles to extinguish the fire, Zuckerberg continues:
Mark: That was the act of a child, not a businessman. And it certainly wasn't the act of a friend. You know how embarrassed I was when I tried to cash a check? And I was with a girl, Wardo. It happened in front of a girl. I'm not going back to that life.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for Zuckerberg here? Are we supposed to be even more dazzled by his character's ascent, knowing that it is tinged with this faux-humanity? Well, sorry, because we're not buying it.
Mostly we're disappointed because a movie about Facebook is a prime opportunity (one that you, Hollywood, have failed to seize) to comment on the zeitgeist of our times. Yet except for a scene in which a girlfriend demands to know why her boyfriend hasn’t changed his relationship status from “single,” The Social Network doesn’t even begin to capture the quirks and conventions of Facebook-saturated modern life. Perhaps that isn’t the story the script was trying to tell, but honestly, we think it would have been a better one.
Sincerely,
FlyBy
