After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I hate talking about politics. This is not a simple aversion to navigate, because talking about politics is a Harvard student’s favorite pastime. You meet someone new on campus, and immediately after learning their name, you learn their political leaning. Usually, this leaning isn’t a surprise, given that Harvard is a (mostly) liberal campus.
After this introduction comes what I call the “Local Politics Tournament” where the winner is determined by who hails from the most problematic state in the U.S. If you live in a red state, you’re likely to win this round — bonus points if you’re from Florida.
While lamenting your state’s unfair legislation is the primary task in this game, it is not the only one. As one person lists their home state's worst qualities, the other competitors must prove how niche their knowledge of regional American politics is. If the speaker mentions the name of their senator and you don’t immediately respond with a murmur of agreement (“Mhm, yeah, I know her”) then sorry, you’re out. And you should feel embarrassed. Not knowing the full names and election histories of all one hundred United States senators? Rookie mistake.
However, it is still not enough to contribute passively — you must also interrupt the speaker with your own opinions. So, even if you don’t know the ins and outs of voter suppression in rural Georgia, you had better pretend like you do. For every tangentially related snippet of local history that you can more or less accurately apply to the conversation, you earn five imaginary points, and a tiny ego boost. Twenty points and you become the official moderator of the debate.
Don’t worry about any hard feelings once the game is over — any political conversation at Harvard takes place under the assumption that all participants are liberal, and by extension, kindhearted people. Therefore, when you traverse controversial topics such as abortion or racial tension, nothing you say can be held against you because you are protected by the shield of liberalism. Harvard kids support Biden, and reproductive rights, and sex workers, and the homeless, and Black Lives Matter. Harvard kids are esteemed and respectable. We are civil and objective, treating every problem with an even-handed, nuanced intelligence that lacerates like a knife.
At the end of the day, political debate on campus is too often treated as a thought-experiment. Harvard students rarely consider the traumas that some “light-hearted debate” can dredge up for members of targeted communities. For some of Harvard’s most vulnerable students, the consequences of who is elected president or appointed to the Supreme Court do not serve only as a theory in an imaginary debate.
Politics are not “hot takes.” They determine someone’s rights, their autonomy, their survival in this country. So no, I don’t like talking about politics. It’s not fun for me, it’s painful.
And Harvard students may present themselves as relatable, welcoming progressives, but that’s not an absolute truth. In 2017, two-thirds of us came from the top 20 percent of the income bracket. Last year, 63 percent of Harvard students entering the workforce post-graduation took jobs in finance, technology, or consulting, while less than five percent went to work at nonprofits, in public service, or as educators. And an unquantifiable number of us complain about being “broke” while we sport one thousand-dollar Canada Goose jackets and spend our summers lounging on the beaches of Cape Cod.
I don’t say this to make privileged Harvard students feel guilty. I say this only so Harvard students understand that they are colder than they recognize, especially when they discuss politics.
So yes, I’m from Chicago, but I’m not going to debate you on its violent crime rate. And yes, I am Black, but my identity is not an open invitation to give me your opinion on systemic racism.
That’s not an icebreaker, and you are not entitled to hear about my lived experiences.
My name is Jasmine, I’m from Chicago, and I’m a first-year. That’s all you need to know for now. It’s nice to meet you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, the College accepted the request of student-led activist group Our Harvard Can Do Better to update its residential community compact. This formal agreement, which the College required all students seeking on-campus housing to sign before arriving this fall, set standards for behavior to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Students found in violation of the compact face non-disciplinary punishments ranging from warnings and safety education to dismissal from campus for the duration of the semester. Following recent activism, the compact now clarifies that students reporting allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment will, in standard cases, not face any repercussions as a result.
“In order to encourage information sharing and seeking support, the College will ordinarily not hold students accountable for violations of the Residential Community Compact if those violations also include allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment,” the compact now states.
We wish to give all of our thanks to Our Harvard Can Do Better. Because of their efforts, campus is a safer place; we commend their leaders’ dedication and active advocacy for the rights of students.
The College also deserves credit for listening to activists and making this timely change. The need to protect students and the entire community from the threat of COVID-19 is pressing, and the compact’s enforcement of basic social distancing requirements is necessary. But social distancing enforcement should not be policing. These sorts of exemptions in the policy are an important part of clarifying this principle, and hopefully other institutions will follow suit when considering whether to involve campus police in rule enforcement.
Ultimately, this policy change shows impressive flexibility and willingness to support students when they are most in the need of allies. The policy adjustment, however, is not flawless. The College should delete the word “ordinarily” from the amended language. No student should feel obligated to remain silent about their sexual assault due to fears of retaliation, and the compact should include clear language to this effect. Coming forward is difficult enough already, and if the word “ordinarily” gives pause to even a single victim, the College has made a vital error. The administrative desire for room to maneuver on policy enforcement is understandable, but student safety should have primacy.
While we are heartened to see this change, we are still concerned about the administration’s choices regarding response to activism more broadly. In this case, students’ requests were not very hard to execute or too far out of line with Harvard’s own preferences. Requests like fossil fuel or prison divestment, fair wages for graduate students, and other sources of campus protest have gone mostly unheeded. Willingness to listen to student voices should apply to all causes, not solely ones that align with Harvard’s beliefs.
On the bright side, this willingness to act demonstrates how anti-sexual violence advocacy has made a lasting change on campus. It was convenient for Harvard to respond to this advocacy because administrative responsiveness to sexual violence is growing, and a culture that seeks to eliminate sexual violence is taking firmer root. A few years ago, such a change might not have succeeded. The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Office of Dispute Resolution, and other offices dedicated to supporting survivors of sexual assault and harassment have been hard at work, and their priorities show.
But while progress in institutional culture and priorities is encouraging, but it’s not the same as substantive reductions in sexual assault occurrences. The most recent comprehensive data we have, from October 2019, tells us that the prevalence of sexual assault didn’t fall in the four years prior. While we very much appreciate the administration’s receptiveness, this fundamental problem should continue to motivate greater urgency in these efforts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vaccines usually take 10 years to develop. The impetus of global lockdowns has given us one inside of a year. Once again, in a time of crisis, humanity has demonstrated its incredible reserve capacity.
It’s not as simple as an unusually focused commitment of resources, although that has certainly helped. The removal of bureaucratic barriers was also very helpful. But I’d guess an important factor, though unquantifiable and so overlooked, was the sense of purpose and duty that scientists and technicians and everyone else felt as they worked on one of the hundred-plus vaccine efforts of the past year.
Per usual, it was an imminent sense of crisis that spurred America to focus its resources and Americans to act with purpose. It was the threat of Germany and Japan in World War II that boosted America’s annual aircraft production from less than a thousand in 1939 to nearly 100,000 in 1944. Over the course of the war, that threat of annihilation allowed President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Class of 1904, to move more than half a million people into the middle of the New Mexican desert and propelled them to split the atom.
We waited 49 years from the Wright brothers’ first flight to the first commercial jet — we waited only 17 more to put a man on the moon. Why? Sputnik scared us. We organized and focused ourselves. And NASA scientists worked invigorated by a sense of duty and urgency.
But even more surprising than our capacity to rise up to a threat are those moments when humanity leaps forward seemingly unprompted. Take the rapid rise of Wikipedia. A bunch of amateurs, working in their spare time, built and maintained an online encyclopedia of 52 million articles that has become the eighth-most viewed website in the country. Even more incredible is how quickly it happened. Long before Jimmy Wales founded Wikipedia in 2001, the world apparently had thousands of people with incredible amateur passion for, collectively, every conceivable field of knowledge. This capacity was always there, deployed at cocktail parties and pub trivia nights like so many undirected air molecules until Jimmy Wales flapped his butterfly wings and created the hurricane that is Wikipedia.
Math Stack Exchange, a website where users ask and answer questions about math, is a similar project to Wikipedia. It has a wonderful feature that shows the number of “people reached” by each user — the aggregate views of their questions, answers, and comments. It’s remarkable how many users have reached thousands of people. Some have reached millions. I’m always amazed at the sheer number of people, in various fields, who know and love enough abstract math to spend their time answering questions. These people have always existed, but they suddenly reach millions thanks to Stack Exchange. A question is answered once as well as possible instead of a thousand different ways at tables and classrooms and dorm rooms scattered across the world.
But Wikipedia and Stack Exchange are the exception in that far more often, we access humanity’s immense reserve capacity only fleetingly. For the most part, an extraordinary portion of human activity is disorganized and undirected.
That may seem a radical claim in our capitalist age, especially to an oversubscribed Harvard student who GCal’s their naps. Certainly, we live directed lives relative to any prior point in history. Perhaps counterintuitively, although our greatest individual leaps of focus have been acts of government intervention and control, capitalism is in many ways the project of increasingly organizing human society. Milton Friedman encapsulates this in his parable of the pencil, describing the immense organizational structures that are created in order to manufacture something as simple as a pencil. Indirectly, slowly, but far more steadily than any government intervention, capitalism pushes to more efficiently draw on our reserve capacity.
But despite the long march of capitalism, relative to our greatest bursts of human organization, our society spends most of its time with a great deal less focus and purpose.
Thank god. The pandemic, after all, has also revealed the perils of seeking to permanently access reserve capacity. Just-in-time shipping strains supply chains in times of crisis. I remember one meme describing a country of “paycheck to paycheck people working for paycheck to paycheck companies taxed by a paycheck to paycheck government.” When companies optimize to the nth degree, even a small exogenous change can be disastrous.
Of course these observations are far too general to inform policy. I’m not suggesting that we don’t tap enough into our reserve capacity, or offering a suggestion as to how much we should. In the wake of a breathtaking, border-line unbelievable 12-month vaccine effort, I’m just writing to record my amazement at humanity’s vast reserves. Welled up in people, welled up in peoples, springing forth in every crisis and, sometimes, just for the hell of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For members of the Class of 2024, the infamously stressful blocking process may be extra fraught due to pandemic-era social restrictions.
Blocking — the process by which freshmen choose the people with whom they will live for the rest of their College experience — commences after winter break, giving the new class ample time to explore connections and test out friendships throughout the fall. But this year, freshmen who studied from home — either due to personal choice or visa restrictions — had limited opportunity to forge relationships with their peers, whom they only glimpsed over Zoom or social media. Even those who spent the fall semester on campus said stringent rules around socializing and the dearth of in-person programming may make it more difficult to form blocking groups.
While the advent of the pandemic has exacerbated anxieties and uncertainties surrounding the blocking process, every class of freshmen traditionally harbors concerns about selecting the perfect blockmates to spend the rest of their undergraduate careers with.
Under the current blocking system, freshmen can either form groups of up to eight people or elect to block alone as a “floater.” Each individual or group is then sorted into one of Harvard’s twelve upperclassmen Houses, where they live for their remaining three years at the College.
The high-stakes social stress of blocking has only been amplified during a pandemic that as profoundly reshaped residential and academic life. After Harvard’s health guidelines rendered parties, study breaks, dinnertime conversations, library study sessions, and pre-class chatter obsolete, socialization among freshmen who resided on campus this fall became limited to small, socially-distanced outdoor gatherings.
Jordan J. Woods ’24, who spent the semester on campus, described the upcoming blocking process as “ominous.”
“I don't feel prepared for it at all,” he said. “Because of how difficult it was to really socialize and make friends.”
For international students — who were barred from coming to campus by visa restrictions — and for others who elected to stay home, the social scene was even more pared down. Instagram follows and text conversations replaced the outdoor gatherings and strolls along the Charles River enjoyed by their on-campus peers.
Anicia A. Miller ’24, a freshman from Chicago, expressed some of her anxieties about blocking as a student who stayed home this semester due to health concerns.
“I was concerned about it, because I'm a student who stayed at home, so I don't really know that many people,” Miller said. “I feel like that process is already sort of nerve wracking. Everyone’s still pretty awkward, not that many connections are that strong yet.”
Similarly, Thamina Noorzai ’24, an international student studying virtually from abroad, said she feels unprepared to jump into the blocking process after winter break.
“That’s one of the main annoying things, that only part of the freshman class could go to campus and not everyone being in the same boat. So I have no idea what to expect,” she said.
Though Noorzai spent the semester living with two fellow international freshmen in Barbados, she said that she doesn’t know enough people to make an informed decision around blocking.
“I feel like there might be people that I would get along with very well, but I just didn't have the chance to get to know them,” she said. “It feels so forced to just say, ‘okay, I know two people, so I'm just gonna have to live with them because I don't know anyone else.’”
Noorzai added that it was a struggle to get to know her classmates living on campus from afar.
“Maybe there will be people that you like on campus, but obviously, you're not going to be able to become friends with them right now,” Noorzai said. “Who's gonna want to Zoom in their free time instead of going out?”
Giulia F. Mazzarelli ’24, who tuned into campus from her home in New York, said she has struggled to gauge her fellow classmates’ personalities without in-person interaction.
“The only thing I see of people is how they are in classes,” Mazzarelli said. “They just might be different in person, and I don’t get that sense of what people are like beyond class.”
In an emailed statement, the Dean of Students Office acknowledged the challenges raised by Covid-19, but expressed faith that freshmen will be able to create bonds despite the circumstances.
“While there were restrictions due to COVID, this didn’t eliminate first-year students’ ability to still form connections with their peers,” the statement read. “We understand a global health pandemic is not an easy time to make in person connections and appreciate students abiding by public health regulations.”
Though the blocking process may look grim, many freshmen are choosing to focus on what they can control.
“I have been getting people’s phone numbers and stuff, you know, trying to do as much as I can to connect with people virtually,” Mazzarelli said. “I’m just going to try to keep a positive mindset about it, but I don’t know how it will go.”
Miller said solidarity and shared experiences among off-campus freshmen improved her outlook on the process.
“Within the community of students who did stay at home who were first-years, we've kind of grown stronger, a bit. So there's a possibility that I could block with someone there,” she explained.
Still, those living off-campus have not been forgotten by their Cambridge-based peers.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, who lived on campus this semester, emphasized the importance of forming friendships and reaching out to international and off-campus students. She said it was especially important to hold “real, genuine, and empathetic consideration” for these students given their lack of control over their residential circumstances, and said that she had been using Snapchat, Instagram, and text to connect with them.
“We've been trying to stay connected in random ways. But I just think it's really important to make sure that we still continue to form those connections because at the end of the day, we're all part of the same class, part of the same student body,” Ahuja said.
Freshmen both on and off campus have the support of their peer advising fellows, too.
“It’s definitely something that's on students' minds, particularly those who are living off campus and maybe haven't had the chance to meet many people,” said Ruth H. Jaensubhakij ’22, who serves as a PAF.
Jaensubhakij said she has been telling the freshman she mentors that blocking is not as important or binding as it may seem. Students are not even required to share a room with their blockmates, she noted.
“I'm hoping that that will alleviate some of the stress. So they know that even if they don't find someone or if there are people that they're not totally sure about, that it's not like you're forever bound to these people,” she said.
Huong T. Le ’22, another PAF, suggested that the College support freshmen by pushing back the deadline for declaring blocking groups and allowing more time for students to form friendships.
In addition to facing social restrictions, she noted, freshmen went home just before Thanksgiving, missing out on the last few weeks of the semester that they would ordinarily spend on campus.
“They were just on campus for two, three months, and it's just not enough for them to make friends,” Le said.
Miller similarly suggested that the College push back the group declaration deadline or plan a large number of events during the period leading up to students’ final decisions.
The Dean of Students Office wrote in its statement that the College expects freshmen to continue forming connections, albeit virtually, as most stay home during the winter recess.
“The College hopes students recognize that they will continue to get to know each other as the year progresses as even in years past, not all students know who they are blocking with by this point in the fall,” the statement read.
They also noted that the College will host a December webinar to answer student questions about the blocking process.
Some students, though, are already feeling prepared to embark on the blocking process.
Ahuja said she felt “insanely blessed” to have found people with whom she would enjoy spending her next three years at the College.
“I do, at the moment, probably have a good group to do a blocking group with, but I know that a lot of that happened by getting to meet people by chance,” she said. “Forming those connections over this past semester has just been a really beautiful thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a normal year at Harvard, students can conveniently drop in at Harvard’s Office of Career Services to speak with a career advisor or grab coffee with a Peer Advising Fellow. Throughout the semester, hordes of undergraduates often swarm career fairs in the Science Center to meet recruiters from reputable companies and connect in person with alumni all over the world.
But now, the check-in desk in the OCS building on 54 Dunster Street has become a virtual kiosk. After the COVID-19 pandemic hit, OCS had to abruptly adapt its resources to an online format, trading pizza events and lively career fairs for virtual advising and webinars: In-person internships have turned into remote opportunities, and Science Center career fairs have become one-on-one virtual meetings with job recruiters.
When Harvard initially confirmed the switch to virtual learning in March, OCS had to convert its services to a virtual platform in a matter of days, according to OCS director Robin E. Mount. The office confronted difficulties ranging from reallocating summer funding from cancelled in-person internships to conducting widespread outreach to freshmen.
Though the road to virtual operations had its bumps, the path also presented unexpected opportunities by eliminating geographical and financial constraints, allowing for a greater range of speakers and recruiters at its events.
After the pandemic derailed many of OCS’s original plans, Ami Ishikawa ’21, an OCS career cluster PAF, said it was challenging for the office to reimagine how this past summer would take shape.
“But we wanted students to understand that this would be an atypical summer, but that didn't mean that it wasn't going to be a worthwhile, rewarding summer for students,” Ishikawa said.
Prior to COVID-19, most Harvard undergraduates rarely considered interning remotely. At the start of the pandemic, OCS staff members themselves only knew “tangentially” about virtual internships and had to quickly educate themselves on the matter to support students after many programs canceled or moved their in-person internships online, according to Anthony Arcieri, the director of Undergraduate Career Advising and Programming at OCS.
“We spent a good deal of time researching job boards that focused on remote internships, identifying employers who had remote opportunities, and getting those posted in Crimson careers,” Arcieri said. “Educating ourselves but also being able to share what we learned with students we're meeting with was another part of that pivot.”
While some in-person internships could not continue online, several OCS partner organizations said they were able to successfully transition to a virtual platform despite only having a few months to do so.
“A lot of us were worried what this transition was going to look like. Will our nonprofits be able to sustain this?” said Alysha L. Johnson Williams ’14, director of the Harvard College Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship’s Pathways to Practice division. “And the answer was overwhelmingly yes.”
Johnson Williams said students responded well to the internships and found them to be “high-quality, valuable experiences.” The organization’s partners also praised the student interns for their helpfulness in the remote setting.
Though the pandemic has devastated the economy at large, it has hit certain industries, including airlines, cruise lines, hotels and restaurants, harder than others and restricted opportunities for employment in these areas, Mount said.
For example, after COVID-19 tanked sales in brick and mortar stores, the retail industry has been especially strained. Though students usually tend to want to work in the corporate side of retail, Deborah Carroll, the associate director for employer relations and operations at OCS, said it has had a snowball effect.
“It's all a chain of events so if things are struggling in brick and mortar, it's going to affect the whole organization,” she said. “That makes it harder for students to find opportunities in the corporate side.”
Jake E. Schwencke ’21, a PAF for arts, media and entertainment industries, also highlighted the unique consequences the COVID-19 has had for creative industries that require in-person interaction, particularly live theater and production. He cited Broadway’s indefinite shutdown as an example.
“I think that's a little scary for people who are trying to enter the entertainment industry, because it's not like a lot of other careers where there's a clear breadcrumb trail to getting to success,” he said. “So to add the pandemic, on top of that, I could see why a lot of students would be nervous to think about fields like this.
As students navigate a job market rife with uncertainty, OCS has simultaneously had to reimagine its services for an online landscape.
OCS is no stranger to remote programming, however, given its experience servicing not only Harvard undergraduates but also students nationwide who study at the Harvard Extension School. Further, because OCS has always offered its services remotely during breaks when students are at home, the office was able to quickly adapt its advising resources and career fairs to a virtual platform using familiar practices and technology, according to Mount.
Nonetheless, there were still other tools and skills OCS had to quickly pick up, Mount said.
“We have to confess Zoom was not in our vocabulary at the beginning but it's now everybody's first word,” Mount said.
Another obstacle OCS has faced is one that is more difficult to overcome: the impossibility of spontaneity and connection in an online environment. This universal, pandemic-wrought challenge was starkly apparent during OCS’s virtual career fairs.
Before the pandemic, students would flood campus buildings to speak with job recruiters and sometimes float in the back of the crowd to observe and listen in on conversations around them. Now, students must meet with job recruiters one-on-one, which Carroll said has given these fairs a more intimidating and evaluative atmosphere.
“A career fair is an event that has a lot of energy,” she said. “There's lots of people, there's lots of conversations, and people would run into their friends they hadn't seen all summer or somebody who they don't see as frequently on campus.”
“That's not really replicable online, so I think that was just another hard part in terms of executing the event,” she continued.
Despite the numerous struggles the pandemic has brought on, Johnson Williams said the flexibility of virtual platforms has also offered exciting opportunities.
In fact, Mount said OCS has actually had comparatively higher turnout for its online programming since students can swiftly move from online class to other virtual events. The transition time from event-to-event is now just a few seconds instead of the regular commute across campus.
OCS is also no longer limited by the maximum capacity of its building and can invite a wider range of guest speakers and companies since the hassle and costs of travel are nonexistent.
“It just allows for increased accessibility for those that would have had barriers to access during the normal school day,” said Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21, a Pre-Health Peer Liaison Peer Advising Fellow for OCS.
Some students said they have been impressed by the quality of OCS’s remote services despite obstacles of the pandemic.
When virtually connecting with an OCS representative during an advising session, Alexandra J. Fogel ’23 reflected on how helpful they were in highlighting possible internship opportunities.
“She directed me to all the relevant websites and gave me further contacts for the opportunities I was interested in and helped me figure out deadlines. She did so much in just 30 minutes. I was really impressed,” Fogel said.
The switch to virtual operations has also forced OCS to think creatively about their future as a hub for career advice on campus.
Mount said OCS has a few initiatives planned for winter break that are meant to energize students and combat “Zoom fatigue” while still providing them with helpful advising and job opportunities. For example, the office’s seminars during which students brainstorm career paths may feature creative modes of communication, such as virtual white boards and sticky notes.
Its annual site visits where OCS exposes students to local companies will also be virtual, allowing the office to expand its reach beyond the Greater Boston Area. For example, OCS is planning a virtual site visit to the National Basketball Association in January, which is typically not possible because it is based in New York City.
As students look toward seeking jobs for the summer and after graduation, Arcieri said OCS is committed to supporting them through the uncertainty of the upcoming semester.
“We want to help students think about their resume, connections with alumni, and we do all these great programs to help students explore paths, but also to make those connections,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers have devised a novel technology for high-resolution, 3D imaging of human chromosomes — structures that carry DNA — in single cells, in a study published in Cell in August.
Chemistry and Chemical Biology Professor Xiaowei Zhuang and her team developed a new method to analyze the effect of chromosome structure on its function. The technique involves connecting dots that represent genomic loci along each DNA chain to form a high-quality image of chromosome structure.
Zhuang’s lab imprinted binary barcodes on the loci to capture and differentiate thousands of loci per cell in fewer rounds of imaging. The lab also monitored transcription activity — the process by which DNA information is copied into RNA — and key structures in the nucleus to better understand how changes in chromatin structure affect cell division and replication over time.
Seon S. Kinrot, a graduate student researcher in Zhuang’s lab, said the project began from two separate initiatives. While another team had focused on developing RNA imaging, Zhuang and Kinrot’s team worked on optimizing these findings for DNA imaging.
“Eventually, we kind of decided to join efforts and make it into a single project that represented a platform where, depending on what type of question and what scale of structures are interested in, you could use one or both of these approaches to try to answer your question,” Kinrot said.
According to Kinrot, though there is no existing method of arbitrary-resolution, genome-wide imaging in single cells, Zhuang’s technology is promising in part because of its high detection efficiency for selected genomic loci.
“For questions that require information about specific genomic loci from single cells, I think this technology can be very, very transformative,” Kinrot said.
He emphasized that his team’s technique can observe chromatin structure in conjunction with transcriptional output.
“That's actually something that I am not aware that any other existing technology can do,” Kinrot said.
Within chromosomes, gene-dense, active regions of chromosomes (known as A chromatin) tend to interact with each other, and gene-poor regions of chromosomes (termed B chromatin) tend to interact with each other, according to Kinrot. These two types of chromatin, though, have little interaction between them.
However, Kinrot explained that the researchers met with unexpected results when studying interactions across — rather than within — chromosomes.
“We saw interactions between active chromatin, but we actually hardly saw any interaction between pairs of B chromatin loci across different chromosomes,” Kinrot said. “It was pretty similar to the degree of interaction between A and B chromatin.”
Kinrot emphasized that this kind of imaging technology, more broadly, can help researchers decipher biological systems with “a lot of contributing components,” as the interactions between those components remain largely unknown.
“I think the ability to really image all these things at the same time can be very powerful to, you know, help actually understand what these relationships are,” Kinrot said.

For patients with severe COVID-19, the key to survival may depend on the quality, rather than the quantity, of their antibody response and development, a recent study from a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School teaching hospital Massachusetts General Hospital suggests.
Medical School Professor Galit Alter, who spearheaded the study, co-leads the pathogenesis working group of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, which was borne from a $115 million collaboration between the University and Guangzhou Institute for Respiratory Diseases — a Chinese research institute — funded by Fortune Global 500 company China Evergrande Group.
Since the start of the pandemic, scientists have worked to understand the virus’s biological mechanisms, including human immune response and antibodies developed against the infection. A lack of existing therapeutics for the virus has pushed researchers to explore different methods to fight the virus beyond vaccination, including treatments using antibodies to bolster immune response.
The study — published Nov. 3 in the peer-reviewed journal Cell — profiled and compared the immune responses of 193 hospitalized COVID-19 patients over the first three weeks following onset of symptoms. To determine whether immune responses differed based on degree of disease severity, researchers stratified patients into three groups: inpatients with moderate infection who recovered, those with severe infection who recovered, and those whose underlying cause of death was the virus.
The team found that while patients in all three groups developed antibodies against the virus, the development and evolution of those antibodies differed: For the patients who did not survive, the antibody response never completely evolved.
In a Nov. 13 press release from Massachusetts General Hospital, Alter said the researchers observed a “significant defect” in immunoglobulin G — the most common type of antibody — among non-survivors.
“There was a significant defect in the development of IgG antibodies, which may be essential in the early control and elimination of the virus,” Alter said in the release. “Here, we were able to see the global impact of this defective IgG evolution, resulting in a compromised ability to promote essential viral clearing immune functions.”
The researchers also found that the immune systems of surviving patients could recognize and target the S2 domain, an area of the virus spike protein found in other human coronaviruses.
In the press release, co-first author and MIT biological engineering graduate student Tomer Zohar said the implications of this research extend beyond COVID-19 infection: The preexisting immunity developed following infection may generate killer antibodies against other coronaviruses at faster rates.
“If we can further understand the importance of cross-coronavirus immunity, researchers may be able to design vaccines able to counteract a much broader range of coronaviruses,” Zohar said in the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chairman of Special Olympics and best-selling author Timothy P. Shriver discussed the importance of unity in politics Monday at the Harvard Law School’s Herbert C. Kelman Seminar on International Conflict Analysis and Resolution.
Shriver said there is a current “pandemic of divisiveness” in politics, which should be addressed by reframing existing methods of storytelling.
“If the dominant story in our culture is about hatred and division, it will drown out the creative energy in this starving majority's hunger for a different story. We've got to find [different] ways to tell these stories,” Shriver said.
In an effort to combat the issue of divisiveness, Shriver launched UNITE, a collaborative dedicated towards bringing Americans together to catalyze solutions to universal issues, earlier this year. Shriver said the current political atmosphere should be restructured by promoting narratives of unity.
“Instead of othering and scapegoating, we need to find ways to transform our pain and our fear into understanding and work and collaboration towards peace and justice,” he said.
Shriver explained that an individual can only become a “uniter” through one’s own volition and choices, rather than through the acquisition of a particular set of skills.
“We are given the choice to be dividers or uniters,” Shriver said. “There is no law, in most places, that can force us to do either. There is no skill that will definitively change how we see one another. There is no story that we can guarantee will create a generation of the uniters. There are choices.”
Shriver identified four core principles of unity: faith, love, anger, and joy. He said faith promotes dignity; love allows for an understanding that “we are all in it together”; anger prevents the acceptance of “humiliation and oppression of others”; and joy grants an appreciation for “the goodness that is possible we repair the breach.”
Robert G. Manson, a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, wrote that Shriver’s lecture had “passion, precision, and clarity of purpose.”
“I fully agree with his points about unity. So much of our outlook on life has to do with perspective,” Manson wrote. “Unity is the key to transforming the way people regard others.”
Another event attendee, Marta González-Ruano Calles, wrote that Shriver’s model of unity inspired her to apply these principles in her own life.
“Now, as a young jurist, I’m determined to follow his advice to transform our fears, anxieties, and angers into understanding, to promote a healthier, happier, and flourishing future to our world,” she wrote.
Other attendees, however, critiqued Shriver’s work on unity for its lack of applicability to situations in which disagreement may be necessary.
Sarah Federman, an assistant professor at the University of Baltimore’s School of Public and International Affairs, wrote that the unity model forces consensus and discourages individuals from challenging conflicting ideas.
“The challenge I see in ‘unity’ models is that unity discourses tend to push towards consensus building. When people make uncomfortable statements, they’re sometimes told they’re not supporting ‘unity.’ This leaves power structures unchallenged, as those labeled ‘spoilers’ get pushed back into their boxes sometimes by well-intentioned people,” Federman wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rep. Debra A. Haaland (D-N.M.) spoke about her roots in political organizing and the unique set of challenges faced by indigenous communities at an Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum event Monday.
Moderated by Linda J. Bilmes, a senior lecturer of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, the event was hosted in tandem with Native American Heritage Month.
As a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe and a 35th generation New Mexican, Haaland was one of the first two Native American women elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.
When asked about how she first became involved in politics, Haaland said that she was inspired to become a phone volunteer to improve voter turnout within her indigenous community and help others with the voter registration process.
“When I was organizing an Indian country we set up booths at the tribal Navajo Nation fairs and the Pueblo feast days,” she said. “We set up voter registration booths, and we had candidates come and speak to voters there.”
As she worked her way up into becoming a political organizer, she explained that she would set out to organize in Indian country, emphasizing the importance of meeting people on their terms.
“We went to their locations,” Haaland said. “We went to meet them on their turf, so to speak, so that we could learn more about those communities and also give them the information that they needed to be able to vote.”
She also credited Emerge New Mexico, an organization that provides political training programs for Democratic women who want to run for office. Haaland, who graduated from the program in 2007, said that Emerge New Mexico “has really done an amazing job in giving women candidates the courage and the confidence to get out there and run.”
Having been raised in a military family, Haaland also discussed how many Americans are unaware that Native Americans and Alaskan Natives serve in the military at five times the national average and have served in every war for the past 200 years. She also highlighted the delicate balance between needing to advocate policies that help service members while also being aware of the U.S.’s ever-growing military budget.
Haaland also serves as the Chair of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands. She said the President Donald J. Trump’s administration has failed to consult with indigenous tribes when managing public lands and referenced mining and drilling in Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, which are sacred cultural sites and wildlife habitats.
“If anyone has ever been to Bears Ears to hike in those areas and look and hike up to the cliff dwellings where ancient Pueblo homes are still visible there on the sides of the cliffs, you would see that it's no place for oil derricks for drilling,” she said. “This is a pristine area that, quite frankly, are where the bones of our Pueblo ancestors are buried. It’s hallowed ground.”
Reiterating the power of political organizing, Haaland emphasized her role as a legislator in getting people involved.
“Before we think about drafting a piece of legislation we need to get out there and make sure that we're asking the people, what do you think about this,” she said. “They deserve to feel like they can trust you, they deserve to feel like what you're saying is truthful and you're transparent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team of researchers at Harvard Medical School has found that the success of a COVID-19 vaccine will depend on not only its efficacy, but also the pace at which it is delivered, the severity of the pandemic, and the public’s acceptance of immunization.
Three major pharmaceutical companies released phase three clinical trial results for their COVID-19 vaccine candidates in November, reporting vaccine efficacy rates — the percentage reduction of disease in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group — well above 50 percent, the threshold for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
The study, published in Health Affairs on Nov. 19, was a collaboration with researchers at Yale School of Public Health led by Rochelle P. Walensky, a Harvard Medical School professor and the Chief of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital — a Medical School affiliate.
Walensky said the group was motivated by a desire to understand how these vaccine efficacy rates translate and contribute to their true effectiveness in the general population.
“There's a lot of different definitions to vaccine efficacy,” Walensky said. “What does that mean? Does that mean that the person who receives the vaccine doesn't get the disease? Does that mean they can't transmit disease? Does that mean they don't get severe disease?”
The team sought to understand true vaccine effectiveness — how well a vaccine works in the population — by accounting for factors in the “current backdrop” of the pandemic which affect vaccine implementation, according to Walensky.
“We combined all those parameters in this model that we were building to look at not only efficacy, but also parameters of effectiveness like coverage, pace, and how bad the pandemic is at the time you're trying to do a vaccination strategy,” Walensky said.
Walensky said the researchers also considered the Americans’ willingness to get vaccinated — a key factor in planning, given that recent surveys have found many would not seek vaccination if a COVID-19 shot were to become available.
The proportion of the population that receives a vaccination is just as important as the vaccine’s efficacy, Walensky said.
“Say you have for all intents and purposes a 100 percent efficacious vaccine but it takes six months to roll out to 50 percent of the population,” she said. “If you only get it to 50 percent of the population, your coverage drops to 50 percent immediately.”
Though the federal government has invested billions in vaccine development through its Operation Warp Speed program, only millions have been invested in implementation and scale-up, according to Walensky.
“The investments in development have not nearly been matched by orders of magnitude in the investment in deployment and communication,” Walensky said.”While there have been a lot of plans that have been drafted, they're not necessarily funded plans, and those plans really need to have money behind them.”
Walensky also said that even a highly effective vaccine will struggle to control the pandemic if infection rates continue to rise.
“If you have a cup of water and it can put out a fire on your stove, that same cup of water can't put out a forest fire,” Walensky said. “It really may work very well, but it's only as good as the backdrop in which it is trying to work.”
Practicing social distancing and mask wearing is key to lowering infection rates and creating the best environment for maximizing vaccine effectiveness, according to Walensky.
“We should not be giving this vaccine more work than it already has to do, and by putting it in the backdrop of a lot of cases, we are doing that,” she said.

Earlier this month, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought in federal court by a former Harvard employee, Eric Clopper, over the Crimson’s coverage of — and the University’s subsequent response to — a 2018 performance he put on at Sanders Theatre.
U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns granted separate motions to dismiss filed by Harvard and The Crimson — which operate independently — due to a failure by the plaintiff to state a claim. In doing so, Stearns dismissed charges of defamation, civil rights, tortious interference, and conspiracy against The Crimson.
On May 1, 2018, Clopper held a performance at Sanders Theatre during which he criticized the practice of circumcision by referring to Jewish people as “an unmasked genital mutilation cult” and stripped nude. In a statement, Harvard spokesperson Rachel Dane said that Clopper’s performance “appears to violate” Sanders Theatre’s entertainment license with the City of Cambridge, which prohibits public exposure of “the pubic area, anus, or genitals, or any simulation thereof.”
Two days later, The Crimson reported that the University was “reviewing” Clopper’s show, and on May 4, The Crimson reported that Clopper — who is Jewish — planned the event during work hours at Harvard. Harvard terminated Clopper’s employment on July 12, according to the lawsuit.
In July 2020, Clopper filed suit in federal court, alleging that Harvard “breached the express and implied employment agreement” and that The Crimson’s characterization of his show as a “nude, anti-Semitic rant” — which appeared in the headline of the paper’s May 3, 2018 story — was “a patent falsehood.”
Clopper also accused The Crimson of conspiring with Harvard to defame and steal the play. The Crimson is editorially and financially independent from the University.
Clopper alleged The Crimson defamed him in three separate instances: by stating Clopper “improperly worked on the play during work hours,” that he “is anti-Semitic,” and that he “engaged in a ‘nude, anti-Semitic rant’ in Harvard's Sanders Theatre.” In a court order, Stearns wrote that “the court determines that none of these statements is actionable.”
Stearns wrote that The Crimson’s claims regarding Clopper’s work schedule were “demonstrably true” and that The Crimson’s description of the performance as “anti-Semitic” constituted “opinions based on disclosed, non-defamatory facts (i.e., direct quotations from the performance).” In reference to The Crimson’s headline, Stearns wrote that “the context of the referenced headline indisputably dispels any defamatory interpretation.”
In the same motion, Stearns dismissed Clopper’s other allegations against The Crimson. Stearns wrote that Clopper’s accusation of conspiracy and tortious interference between The Crimson and The University “fail because they depend on the viability of the nonactionable defamation claim.”
Aidan F. Ryan ’21, The Crimson’s President, wrote in a statement that “the federal district court’s well-reasoned decision recognizes that journalists at all levels are protected by the First Amendment.”
“Judge Stearns’s ruling does not merely protect the right to freedom of the press. It also vindicates The Crimson’s longstanding commitment to reporting fairly, frankly, and in accordance with the highest standard of journalistic ethics,” Ryan added.
Clopper has until December 7, 2020, to appeal Stearns’s decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 1, 2020, at 1:30 p.m. 
Harvard will expand the number of undergraduates invited to live on campus next semester, including College seniors and juniors who enrolled this fall, as classes continue online.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced the decision Tuesday afternoon in an email cosigned by University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. It fulfills and expands a July promise administrators made to prioritize the Class of 2021 in spring housing decision making.
Gay wrote that the College will use all of its 3,100 undergraduate bedrooms this spring.
Administrators will first prioritize seniors and currently-enrolled juniors. It will also favor applicants who lived on campus this semester or over winter break due to special circumstances, who live in a time zone “four or more hours distant from Eastern Standard Time,” or who are underclassmen with “learning environment needs” this spring. After it reviews petitions from those categories, the College will prefer juniors currently taking leaves of absence.
Gay wrote that the low COVID-19 transmission rates on campus this fall and Harvard affiliates’ adherence to public health protocols informed the FAS’s decison to invite more students in residence. Since June 1, Harvard has recorded just 27 positive tests among undergraduates; Gay wrote that the University tallied 38 cases among campus residents this fall.
“This decision reflects the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for the residential program this fall,” Gay wrote. “Our campus maintained a COVID-19 positivity rate well below that of the surrounding greater Boston community and there has been no evidence of transmission among members of our undergraduate residential population.”
The FAS may, however, change its planning for the spring semester depending on public health circumstances.
“For that reason, our spring plan is just that, a plan,” Gay wrote. “If circumstances continue to deteriorate across the nation, we are prepared to respond quickly with appropriate contingency plans that would reduce expected campus density before the start of the spring term.”
For the 25 percent of undergraduates who lived in the dorms from late August through Thanksgiving — including non-international freshmen and select upperclassmen — life at Harvard little resembled previous semesters. The College asked those students to sign a Community Compact promising to abide by public health guidelines, to submit to testing three times each week, and to eschew most social contact in favor of Zoom. It also established a group to adjudicate violations of social distancing rules, the Community Council, which at one point dismissed three freshmen from the dorms after they held an illicit gathering of at least six people.
While the Ivy League has not decided whether it will hold its spring sports season, the FAS’s decision not to invite all students back to campus “has implications for our Athletics program,” Gay wrote.
“While the Ivy League has not yet issued a decision regarding spring sports competitions beyond February, we recognize that any plan that does not aspire to return us to full density will necessarily place limits on what athletic activities are possible at Harvard this spring,” she wrote.
The University will offer the same financial aid and term-time work accommodations as it did this fall, granting students who receive aid a $5,000 room and board allowance.

Presenting… Sophomore declarations of 2020, STEM edition! It might feel like there are three billion different STEM concentrations here at Harvard, so we’ve compiled a bit of insight into just a couple of the paths you might decide to take.
Neuroscience: Anna M. Peters
Many existential crises later, I decided to concentrate in Neuroscience! Coming into college, I knew I wanted to study some kind of science, but I wasn’t entirely sure which one. I remember quickly skimming through the concentration list and thinking that Neuroscience sounded so cool, even though I wasn’t sure what it exactly was. Nevertheless, I still picked that when anyone ever asked me what I was going to study. I’m glad I did, because that question was actually quite common. As I began to say it more and more, I began to think, “Yes, I think this is what I will concentrate in.”
Then, I began to ~explore~ different interests and was once again confused about what to study. From Environmental Science to Economics, I was probably changing my mind every other week — a literal spiral. Good thing we didn’t have to declare freshman year, or else I would’ve switched my concentration at least 15 times, and that is not an exaggeration. My indecisiveness (which is a Sagittarius trait apparently?) eventually came to an end, and I ultimately decided to concentrate in Neuro. Yes, I know. I went in a full circle.
I was drawn to the unique intersection between what you can and cannot see, the “why” and “how” of human behavior. I found it fascinating that our behavior could be explained by particular biological mechanisms. Additionally, the applications of neuroscience are also so broad, which gives it that perfect interdisciplinary balance. I have no regrets (yet?) in choosing Neuro and am excited to further explore this field of study!
Human Evolutionary Biology: Naomi A. Freilich
Arguably one of the most challenging questions I have faced during my life sciences career thus far was not on a pset, but rather deciding which life sciences concentration was the right one for me. (For reference, there are *many* to choose from.) Coming into Harvard, I didn’t actually understand that there is no such thing as a “Biology” concentration (yes, very confusing). After spending the past few months going back and forth between a handful of concentrations, getting on calls with students from numerous departments, and attending advising sessions (PSA: Go to those, they’re SUPER helpful, and talking about your hopes/concerns/what you want to get out of your undergrad education outloud is not only pretty therapeutic, but also helps you pin down exactly what you want), I decided to declare Human Evolutionary Biology.
This will sound tacky — and I know this might be somewhere on the department’s website — but I am really excited to tackle the questions of who we are as humans and what makes us human, and the flexibility afforded by the HEB concentration will enable me to approach these questions from numerous perspectives. The Mind, Brain, and Behavior track is something especially exciting to me, and hopefully I’ll be able to take that route through HEB. (But as life has recently taught me, there are so many unexpected twists and turns, so I’ll see where my HEB experience takes me.) Though this quality isn’t really quantifiable, I’d have to say that HEB also gives off good vibes — so even though I might be a stressed pre-med, I’m excited to surround myself with this positivity.
I think we’re all ready for winter break, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say I’ve had my fair share of going through the my.harvard course catalog to get excited for Harvard Zoom 2.0. For now, I’m looking forward to GENED 1027, “Human Evolution and Human Health” and hopefully some other niche HEB courses. Maybe I’ll see some of you on Zoom :)
Neuroscience: Christine S. Lee
In all honesty, I came into Harvard quite set on my wish to pursue Neuroscience as my chosen concentration. Whether out of fear of unprecedented change, genuine interest in the field, or not wanting to adjust my Harvard intro once I’d gotten it down pat, I’ve stuck with it for the past year. Luckily, the Neuroscience department at Harvard is full of incredible advisors (Ryan Draft has saved my life), professors (Professor Lichtman encourages genuine intellectual pursuit in all his students!), and resources for all looking to join its ranks of admirably inquisitive minds.
The numerous hospitals in Boston also make neuroscience research opportunities happily abundant. As someone whose past research experience merely entailed pig dissections and paper chromatography in AP Biology, I was incredibly nervous to attempt my first official research work at Harvard. Luckily, I’ve been able to join an incredible team at the MGH Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, giving me the chance to expand my knowledge of relevant anatomical terms and grow in confidence in a far more involved, academic setting.
On-campus organizations such as the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, Behavior and Harvard Neuroscience Undergraduate Society provide such incredible opportunities for students to nurture their interests in the field with like-minded individuals. I’ve been able to apply my love of writing (Hey, Flyby!) to the Harvard Brain Journal as a writing and layout editor, and my content creating background to the Harvard Brain Exercise Initiative for Alzheimer’s patients as a video editor.
Truly, this is one of the main reasons why I love Neuroscience at Harvard so dearly: There are countless ways by which one can combine multiple interests into a single, tailored pathway, all under the context of such an exciting field. Having also declared a secondary in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights, I can’t wait to see where these intersecting pathways take me in the future!
