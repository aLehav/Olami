After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since 2007, a BCS-conference team will travel to Lavietes Pavilion when the Harvard men’s basketball team hosts Colorado tomorrow afternoon.
The Crimson (3-1) is looking to pick up a win over a top-conference opponent for the fourth straight season against a talented Buffaloes team (2-2) that returns its top three scorers from last year’s squad that finished eighth in the Big 12.
Colorado is led by a duo of elite guards in senior Cory Higgins and sophomore Alec Burks.
Higgins, the Buffaloes’ leading scorer last season, has not showed signs of slowing up in his senior year, averaging 18.8 points and 5.3 rebounds through four games.
Meanwhile, Burks—a projected first-round pick in this June’s NBA draft—has gotten off to an even hotter start, scoring 23 points per contest.
A 6’6” guard with the ability to get to the basket and stroke the ball from mid-range, Burks could provide some matchup problems for the Crimson. Harvard’s top perimeter defender—sophomore Brandyn Curry—is likely too small at 6’1” to match up with Burks, meaning the task will fall on either classmate Christian Webster or junior co-captain Oliver McNally.
Like Burks, Webster, a 6’5” wing, has had an impressive start to his sophomore campaign. Four days after netting a career-high 29 points at Mercer last Saturday, Webster nailed a game-winning three-pointer against Bryant to give the Crimson its third win of the season.
If Harvard hopes to come out on top tomorrow afternoon, it will have to rely on Webster’s offensive production.
Also crucial to the Crimson’s success will be its frontcourt.
Colorado’s two losses this season have come in games where the Buffalos were outrebounded. Junior co-captain Keith Wright and sophomore Kyle Casey—who is returning from a broken foot—will have the primary responsibility of winning the battle on the boards.
If the Crimson can control the glass, the squad has a chance to come away with its first victory against an opponent from the Big 12 in program history.
Under fourth-year head coach Tommy Amaker, the Crimson has had recent success against opponents from the power-six conferences, racking up a 3-5 record while picking up wins in each of the past three seasons.
In Amaker’s first season at the helm, the Crimson managed to pull out a 62-51 win against Michigan in front of a packed crowd at Lavietes Pavilion.
Harvard followed up with back-to-back wins at BC in each of the past two seasons, defeating the Eagles 82-70 during the 2008-09 campaign and 74-67 during the 2009-10 season.
Harvard will get its first shot at extending its streak tomorrow afternoon, but if the Crimson falters, it will have three more chances to pick up a victory against an opponent from an elite conference before the season’s end.
Harvard will travel to Michigan (Big 10) on Dec. 4 and then meet Connecticut (Big East) in Hartford on Dec. 22.
Finally, the Crimson will look to make it three in a row against Boston College (ACC) on Jan 5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first weekend of the holiday season, there certainly wasn’t much cheer in a packed Bright Hockey Center.
The Harvard men’s hockey team (2-5-0, 2-5-0 ECAC) was blown out, 8-2, by conference rival Dartmouth (5-3-1, 4-2-1) last night.
“Obviously, it was a frustrating game,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “I thought there were some stretches in the first half where we battled and created some chances for ourselves, but you know, I think we got pretty much outworked, outhustled, outcoached, outplayed, pretty much all night.”
The Big Green got things off on the right foot, putting its first two on-target shots into the back of the net.
Just over three minutes into the game, Dartmouth rookie Eric Robinson skated in up the right side, putting a shot on Harvard assistant captain Kyle Richter. Richter made the initial save, but the rebound landed on the stick of Doug Jones, and the junior powered it home for the early lead.
Eleven seconds later, Big Green senior Matt Reber stole the puck in the neutral zone and fed it to a streaking Scott Fleming. Fleming, skating in alone on Richter, beat the senior to double Dartmouth’s advantage.
“That’s going to happen in hockey—bounces, they aren’t going to go your way,” sophomore Conor Morrison said. “We’re just going to keep getting pucks to the net and keep driving guys and keep working hard. We can’t really change our whole game plan because two bounces don’t go our way.”
Richter settled in after the rocky start, making 13 saves in the period, as Harvard matched the Big Green shot for shot in the frame.
The Crimson cut its deficit in half with 5:24 to play in the first. On the power play, Morrison took a pass from classmate Danny Biega at the point and crossed the puck down to the right post. Marshall Everson was waiting to deflect the shot in, and the sophomore beat Dartmouth goaltender James Mello to bring the score to 2-1.
But the Big Green jumped right back ahead four minutes into the second period. Robinson tallied his first collegiate goal on a shot from the right boards that flew over Richter’s head and into the cage.
With the score 3-1, Richter was pulled in favor of classmate Ryan Carroll.
For most of the second period, the move appeared to be a good one, as Carroll made a number of key saves while Harvard’s power play once again took advantage of its opportunities.
Midway through a mid-period power play, senior Michael Biega skated up the ice from the blue line before dropping a pass back to junior Alex Killorn. Killorn cut toward the goal line, leaving a back-door pass for Morrison at the left post, which the sophomore buried.
For a team that had scored just one goal with the man advantage in its first six games, getting two against Dartmouth was a step in the right direction.
“I think we had great puck movement, great puck support,” Morrison said. “They really pressured us up high, and guys did a great job of getting open for us down low so we could just get pucks to the net.”
But the positives for the Crimson ended there, as the Big Green took a close game and blew it wide open.
Dartmouth pushed its lead back up to two with 4:45 to go in the second. Robinson, who recorded the first three points of his collegiate career, skated in on a breakaway. Carroll saved the initial shot, but Nick Walsh swooped in and batted the rebound into the open left side of the net.
The Big Green poured it on in the third, starting with Walsh’s second goal of the game with 17:54 to play. The tally, which beat a diving Carroll, came right after Harvard had successfully killed off a long 5-on-3 penalty.
“They’re a team that, once they get on top of you, and you have to take some chances or you take penalties, they can stretch the game out on you,” Donato said. “They have a veteran team with a lot of scoring, and they’re a very talented group.”
With just under nine minutes to play, rookie Matt Lindblad brought the score to 6-2 with a power-play tally from the right side.
“They’re too good a hockey team to give 10 penalties, 10 power plays to,” Donato said. “I think in the first half of the game when the game was in the balance, we did a pretty good job killing penalties, but I think it also wore our guys down. They were tired.”
Carroll was then pulled for rookie Raphael Girard, who made his collegiate debut.
But Girard struggled just as much as his senior counterparts, allowing a pair of goals to the Walsh brothers. Sophomore Dustin Walsh put a shot over Girard’s extended leg with five minutes left on the clock, and Nick Walsh finished his hat trick on the power play in the game’s final two minutes.
Dartmouth outshot Harvard for the game, 45-27. The Crimson has a chance to right the ship against the Big Green in the second half of the home-and-home series tonight in Hanover.
“Certainly we’d like to have a better effort, and we feel good about our group,” Donato said. “But it’s not as easy to feel that way after tonight’s performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To say the Harvard men’s hockey team faces a number of challenging opponents on the ice is a true statement—but it looks like the Crimson’s competition is making an impact off the ice as well.
Among the group of collegiate men’s hockey players named as candidates for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award, four are on teams that will match up against Harvard at some point during the 2010-11 season.
Dartmouth senior defender Evan Stephens and Yale senior forward Broc Little represent the Ivy League, while Union forward Stephane Boileau and Merrimack forward Chris Barton are other Crimson opponents that made the list.
The players are currently part of a group of 20 candidates that will be narrowed down to 10 finalists during the regular season. Those 10 will then make up the final ballot, with the winner being announced in April during the NCAA Division I Men’s Frozen Four.
Although no Harvard hockey players made the cut, Katherine Sheeleigh of Crimson women’s soccer was named a finalist for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award for soccer earlier this year. Results from that voting should be announced in the next few weeks.

Are you constantly finding new ways to incorporate HUHDS ingredients into recipe masterpieces? Obsessed with the presentation of your meticulous food arrangements? The master of dining hall concoctions?
If any of these apply, then hurry up and get your recipes on paper—submit them to the new Food Literacy Project Cookbook.
The FLP is putting together a cookbook featuring recipes from the dhall, aimed for distribution this December. The best recipe will win fame and fortune (okay, free hot chocolate from Burdick's) and in order to win you need to move quickly! You only have one day to submit, as submissions are due tomorrow, Nov. 28.
So, whether it’s mixing peanut butter with froyo and cereal, putting banana slices in your waffle batter, or making a salad bar chicken-curry pita wrap, the FLP wants your ideas. Get those creative cooking juices flowing and don’t be afraid to get funky with your food!
This process is the first installment of a campus-wide FLP and student cookbook. Last year, Cabot came out with its own FLP-student collaboration, and many other Houses have done the same. Perhaps with the help of all Harvard foodies, a new creative tradition is underway—one that will bring the FLP cookbook to each and every dining hall as this project aims to do.
