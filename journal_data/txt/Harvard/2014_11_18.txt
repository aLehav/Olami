After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the cover of Mathias Enard’s “Street of Thieves,” geometric blue and white lines zigzag across a red background. This dynamism, combined with the title, suggests a labyrinthine thriller; the blurb on the back sets it up even further as a wild, socially relevant coming-of-age story. Unsurprisingly, though, judging a book by its cover proves to be a mistake. “Street of Thieves” delivers well on the socially relevant elements of its premise but presents a plot with little electricity and a main character without much depth.
The book traces the story of Lakhdar, a modern Moroccan man who travels across the Eastern hemisphere after being disowned. Settings range from Morocco to Tunisia and Spain as Lakhdar works for a fundamentalist Islamic group, holds down a variety of odd jobs, and gets involved in a love affair. However, all plot events feel slightly unimportant. Lakhdar is frequently on the outside of whatever major international event happens to be occurring: while his girlfriend gets involved in Occupy Spain and his friends become terrorists, Lakhdar simply sits inside drinking beer and typing out manuscripts for a living.
Granted, there’s an element of realism in this. If Enard aimed to describe the turbulent environment of the Middle East from an everyday perspective, highlighting the undramatic, human side of revolution, he’s succeeded. And there is definite social value in seeing an area so often defined by its violent extremists described instead by someone who simply wants love and a good book to read. In its quietness, then, the book emphasizes that, for many people in the Middle East, violent extremism is an unhappy, depressing fact of life that can be neither avoided nor stopped. This sense of pointlessness and futility is expressed particularly well when Lakhdar describes a terrorist he once knew: “Journalists and writers…hurried to understand and explain as if there were something truly interesting in the paranoid ravings from the a brain of a bastard so frazzled that even Al-Qaida didn’t want him.”
As far as its social conscience, the book also makes some incisive observations about the path to terrorism, Islam, and the internet. In one moving section, the Islamist organization leads a mob to attack a bookseller. Accusing the man of blasphemy, the group expects Lakhdar to assault the man, and Lakhdar reluctantly does so: he simply wants to please the people who have taken him in, seeing no comfortable way out of the situation. This, Enard suggests, is the trap of terrorist organizations: the poor and lost become entangled in notions of belonging and expectation.
Lakhdar is also an internet aficionado, using Facebook to connect with girls in the Western world—or as he calls it, the “free zone.” The web, though never a major plot point, plays a regular part of his life, providing him with connection and relief. Thus, Enard subtly acknowledges the enormity and power of social media in the Middle East, perhaps referencing the internet’s role in the Arab Spring. At one point, he also describes a character obsessed with finding gory images on Google, noting that the technology also enables a new level of voyeurism. Terrorist tragedies, a fact of life in the place he describes, can turn into mere entertainment for those of a world away.
All of this social poignancy, though, does little to actually animate the plot. The story itself passes along in mere anecdotes, most of which barely sustain mild interest. The unifying plot lines—Lakhdar’s involvement with a girl named Judit and his friendship with someone from the Islamist organization—come across as equally lackluster. His friend, Bassam, disappears early in the novel, and much ado is made over Lakhdar’s agonizing uncertainty even though it’s abundantly clear what Bassam has been up to.
The love story is also hard to believe. Judit, Lakhdar’s girlfriend, is given almost nothing in the way of a personality, and the relationship has little to no spark. It also doesn’t help that these relationships, together with all of Lakhdar’s actions, are described with annoying psychological simplicity. Violating the key rule of “show, don’t tell,” Enard directly states Lakhdar’s motivations for doing something, often through oversimplified cause-and-effect relationships. In one case, Enard allows a depressing encounter with a prostitute to explain Lakhdar’s entire reaction to a woman living next door to him. “I never dared go up with her…because of the memory of Zahra, the little whore in Tangier, which saddened me,” he says. Creating character depth requires creating an intricate and half-hidden web of desires, fears, and actions, but Lakhdar puts everything on the table right away.
The book’s style is also often difficult to engage with. Though the writing has moments of real prettiness, some sentences consist of five or more independent clauses tacked on to one another confusingly and with seeming randomness. One of the first sentences in the book, for example, is ten lines long. In excerpt, it reads, “A few months later I got my first real beating, an avalanche of blows the like of which I had never experience before, I ended up half unconscious and in tears, from humiliation as much as from pain, my father was crying too…” and so on. Enard may have aimed for a kind of Joycean conscious-stream, but the effect is instead one of jumbled excess.
More precise language would have helped, to be sure, but the novel’s real problem is its lack of meaty plot or character. There’s plenty of thematic material to work off of, and, had Enard found a better way to package his thinking, the book might have carried real resonance; as is, though, it just stumbles along.

For 118 days, Maziar Bahari’s closest relationship was with a man whose name he didn’t know and whose only distinguishing feature was the scent of rose water that emanated when he entered a room. This man, who Bahari referred to as Rosewater, was his torturer.
A journalist for Newsweek at the time, Bahari was arrested after filming the 2009 Iranian elections and the subsequent protests. Iranian officials accused Bahari of being a spy based on his comments in a mock interview he did for “The Daily Show”; however, his arrest was surely influenced by his election involvement. During his imprisonment, he was kept in solitary confinement and forced to wear a blindfold. Bahari was eventually released due to media attention and the advocacy of international leaders.
Bahari wrote a memoir of his experience entitled “Then They Came for Me,” and on Nov. 14, the film version, “Rosewater,” will be released.
“The film is an adaptation of the book which was an adaption of a life,” Bahari said. Rather than focusing on a realistic depiction of Bahari’s experience, the film is about life and democracy in Iran and the changing nature of journalism.
For a man who endured almost four months of torture and interrogation in an Iranian prison, Bahari is able to see his experience as an example and as a force for change. “[‘Rosewater’] is really a film about hope; it’s a film about resilience. It’s a film about the power of journalism; it’s about family, culture,” Bahari said with anything but a pessimistic attitude.
“Rosewater” is the directorial debut for Jon Stewart, who also wrote the film. The film stars Gael García Bernal as Bahari and Kim Bodnia as Rosewater.
For Stewart, a film about an abusive government seems like a departure from his TV persona. But the journalist once called “the most trusted man in America” used his experience on “The Daily Show” to incorporate comedic elements in the film (also present in the memoir) that add both humor and make the characters more relatable and complex.
An example of one of these comedic moments in the midst of interrogation sessions is Rosewater’s fascination with topics such as New Jersey and sexual norms in America. He asks if “The Sopranos” is porn, and Bahari convinces him that Fort Lee, N.J. is a “massage playground.”
Stewart also used his entertainment skills during the film’s difficult shoot in Jordan. “It was during Ramadan, we didn’t have that much money, it was really hot, the production company that they were working with was not very transparent with their employees,” Bahari said. “And Jon has to just humor them; he had to entertain them by being Jon Stewart. He learned a few words of Arabic, and he had to do basically stand-up, in Arabic.”
But all kidding aside, “Rosewater” deals with issues that are both very difficult to watch and disturbingly relevant today.
While the torture and interrogation shown in “Rosewater” is less severe than what actually occurred, the depiction of Iran is anything but flattering. Officials are portrayed as rule-abiding and ruthless, and the Iranian people (and their opinions) are just pawns in a national game for power. “What you see in this film is an everyday reality in Iran, in China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Russia,” Bahari said.  According to him, authoritarian regimes institutionalize torture and interrogations. His experience is no anomaly, but rather the fate for so many in Iran who choose to take a position opposing the government.
Bahari was lucky and received worldwide media attention and the support of leaders such as Hillary Clinton, which eventually led to his release. But many others are not so fortunate. Two members of Bahari’s own family were imprisoned in Iran for their political views—his father under the Shah and his sister under Ayatollah Khomeini (it is actually the voice of his father that sustains Bahari through his imprisonment in the film.) This kind of brutal treatment in countries such as Iran doesn’t make the news for every victim, and most stories don’t end in a prisoner’s release.
Bahari also hopes the film acts as a commentary on reporting in an era of social media and instant communication. “[The film is] about the changing nature of journalism, that professional journalism is somehow in decline because the citizen journalism is on the rise. Citizen journalists are becoming much more powerful than professional journalists,” Bahari said.
In a previous era, journalists were symbolized by a pad of paper and a pencil. Today, anyone with a smartphone can be a journalist. Revolutions are spread through social media and information is available to anyone who can access the internet. News is now a constantly updating cycle. This development both revolutionizes the scope of information and the power of the individual to act as reporter. However, it also puts people in authoritarian countries at risk of doing something as simple as pressing “record.”
Bahari was captured on the basis of his camera. While his interrogators claimed his arrest was based on his work as a “spy” (according to “The Daily Show” interview), Bahari was taken by the police only after he had released footage of protests following the 2009 elections that damaged the image of the Iranian government.
His release from prison wasn’t just a victory; for Bahari, it was the beginning of a challenge to achieve rights for journalists and citizens in Iran. “The film is telling a universal truth,” Bahari said. The challenge is to change this truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I never imagined that a day would come when some of the world’s leading corporations would fund calls for Israel’s destruction, let alone at one of the world’s most prestigious universities. But that is exactly what happened last week at Harvard.
My invitation to “Harvard Arab Weekend” promised to provide a “mosaic of perspectives and insights on the most pressing issues in the Arab world.” Many of the panels appeared worthy of the conference’s corporate support from McKinsey & Co, The Boston Consulting Group, Booz Allen Hamilton, Bank Audi, Strategy&, and the energy giant Shell. And yet featured prominently on the conference agenda was a panel devoted to the destruction of Israel: “The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement: Accomplishments, Tactics and Lessons.”
The panel’s moderator, Ahmed Alkhateeb, began by noting that a primary goal of the BDS movement is “promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties” in what is today Israel. As President Barack Obama pointed out in 2008, this goal stands in opposition to a “two state solution” and “would extinguish Israel as a Jewish State.” And in an op-ed published in Al Akhbar newspaper, Cal State professor As’ad AbuKhalil, an outspoken advocate of the BDS movement, affirmed that “the real aim of BDS is to bring down the state of Israel.” This is the “unambiguous goal…[and] there should not be an equivocation on the subject.”
He’s right. While Jews are the majority in the democratic state of Israel today, the BDS movement imagines and seeks a state in which Jews would ultimately become the minority, implying the end of the Jewish people’s right to self-determination.
Of course, students have a right to speak their minds freely, and corporate sponsors have a right to donate their money and institutional backing to any political view. But is it appropriate for Harvard University to lend its facilities to a group of activists who are working to eradicate the one Jewish state?
Not everyone at Harvard thinks so. Former Harvard president and current professor, Lawrence H. Summers, spoke out in 2002 against calls for Harvard to divest from Israel. When I asked him about last week’s panel, he told me that “promoting BDS is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind when I warned years ago about actions that were anti-Semitic in effect, if not intent.”
“Avoiding censorship, which is right, should not equal sponsorship, which is wrong,” Summers explained. “I am sorry that Harvard, not for the first time, has allowed its good name to be associated with calls to delegitimize Israel.”
The panel at Harvard was not a debate about the goals and merits of BDS—it was an endorsement. Panelists included a vocal supporter of BDS who frequently accuses Israel of “apartheid,” a professor who initiated the American Studies Association academic and cultural boycott, a Presbyterian minister who led the Church boycott of Israel, as well as MIT professor Noam Chomsky.
Student organizers of the panel told me that Chomsky would provide the “anti-BDS” perspective, and he was introduced as the only voice on the panel to be critical of BDS “tactics.” But Chomsky would have none of it: “It’s interesting that I’m introduced as someone that has criticized BDS tactics; actually I have strongly advocated for BDS.”
Chomsky also encouraged anti-Israel activists to take a phased approach toward the annihilation of Israel as a Jewish state: “The one-state option is a good idea in the long run but there’s only one way that I can imagine we can reach it, and that’s in stages.”
The panel discussion left me with an overwhelming sense of sadness: I was sad to see firsthand how BDS encourages Palestinians to reject compromise in pursuit of the destruction of Israel; sad that the student organizers of the conference were unwilling to create a panel of diverse, honest views that would have led to true dialogue; sad that Harvard administrators allowed an event promoting an end to the national existence of the Jewish people to take place under Harvard’s auspices; and sad that the names and institutional prestige of major corporations were used to give legitimacy to the BDS campaign.
I sent inquiries to senior executives at every sponsor company before the conference, but the panel went on. After the conference, a senior McKinsey spokesman wrote to me to apologize for the firm’s involvement with the conference: “The firm does not knowingly associate its name with political issues and debates.” I believe it is likely that the other corporate sponsors also did not intend to have their funds used to promote the BDS movement.
Corporations and universities should not lend mainstream legitimacy to such a radical and odious movement, nor should they provide funding or resources to events that demonize Israel as this one did.
I hope Harvard and the corporations that sponsored Harvard Arab Week—and in doing so sponsored the BDS panel—will publicly pledge to be more vigilant in the future and never again associate their names or provide funding to any movement that seeks to destroy Israel.

My friends are my soulmates. They are my raison d’etre. They are my One Great Love. Maybe this declaration is just something a single twenty year-old says to make her bae-less existence feel better. But, right now, I believe that this statement of adoration is a beautiful truth. I am completely and totally head-over-heels in love with all of my friends.
I often tell my best friends about unsatisfying relationships–I’ll gripe about the boy who never called or vent about the people who make me feel invalidated or unwanted. But all of this time spent dwelling on objectively unfulfilling interactions could be put to better use. And so, all of a sudden, I want to say it, all over the Internet and in every breakfast lunch and dinner conversation and during every dance party on the banks of the Charles and after every Kuumba rehearsal, across the Yard and through my sister’s apartment window and over Skype and FaceTime and the GroupMe that constantly connects us across the country and world: Thank you for caring about me.
In the documentary “20 Feet from Stardom,” singer Lisa Fischer talks about romantic relationships: “When you get into a relationship, you know, there’s an energy. It’s like when you see a married couple walking into a room. You see them apart, but you still feel that string that binds them. I never really had that. So I always felt like I belonged to everyone, you know, a part of my heart, a part of who I am belongs to everybody.” One day, I hope that a single string will bind me to that someone else. But, I don’t just want one string. For now, I want to meditate on the beauty of a web (and no, I’m not talking about polygamy). While I may not have one string connecting me to my better half across the room, I walk around every day connected by many strings to many true loves–my friends. This lattice of friendship is the foundation of acceptance from which I take risks with my heart, and it is the place where I land when my single invisible strings inevitably break.
I think that part of us has been socialized to believe that the Cory and Shawn kind of love is somehow less consuming or complex than the Cory and Topanga kind of love. And this attitude comes across in the public discourse around social life at college. People feel the constant need to revive the conversation about college hook-up culture, and while that conversation is important and I’m willing to participate in it, I also want to simultaneously have a discussion about something just as significant: college friendship culture.
There is such an art to being a good friend, and my friends express this art in many forms: their perfectly crafted and well-timed supportive texts, their mastery of my bad moods, their aptitude for making me feel validated. These acts are profound.
Perhaps part of the cure to this mess of college dating is elevating the importance of platonic love. When I remind myself of my loving friendships, the blows of all that other romantic stuff become much easier to handle. And, I also believe that working on becoming a good friend can’t help but affect the way we treat the people we involve ourselves with romantically. Maybe elevating the importance of good friendships would allow us to ditch the classic  “who cares less” game for a second and have the courage to be honest. And, whether that honesty comes out as “I’m so into this” or “I’m just not feelin’ it,” at least it will come from a place of compassion.
However, friendship is much more than just an insurance policy against heartbreak or a training platform for how to treat people well. It is a bold entity on its own. My friendships are worth a constant stream of novels and songs and poems.
Hannah Horvath of “Girls” may have been right when she wrote, “A friendship between college girls is grander and more dramatic than any romance.” Due to my lack of successful experience in the romance department, I will refrain from any definitive comment, but I do want to acknowledge that Lena Dunham, through Hannah, is getting at an important point. College relationships aren’t doomed or extinct, and millennials haven’t lost the ability to love. We convey our loving capacity through our friendships every day.
For a second, I’m going to extend this already sappy piece in an even more idealistic direction. Every single person on this campus deserves to feel supported by friends, so why don’t we walk around and make everyone we see feel a little more loved? Let’s stop doing that thing where we avoid eye contact with the kid we only sort of know from section. Look at her in the eye and say hello, and then imagine for a second all of the amazing risks you would take if you felt like the entire Harvard community had your back.

Stillman Infirmary is a ten-bed facility at Harvard University Health Services. Given the program’s size, one might be surprised by the student outcry following HUHS’s announcement that it would shut down Stillman before the spring semester. In the past day, a petition calling for continuation of services at Stillman Infirmary had garnered 150 signatures at the time this article went to press.
Ultimately, it seems that the head of HUHS, Paul Barreira, was convinced by student outcry on the matter. It is expected that, in response to criticism, HUHS will create a 24-hour walk-in urgent care system to take the place of Stillman Infirmary. While the new urgent care unit would likely lack the overnight beds Stillman currently features, students would be able to stay at the care center for a few hours. This is a positive development, and HUHS should be commended for taking the student outcry seriously.
Original reports indicated that Stillman would be replaced by a phone triage system wherein students would call a number and speak to a nurse or therapist. After students’ symptoms are evaluated, those in need of immediate care would be directed to the emergency room, most likely at Mt. Auburn Hospital. Reallocated funds would go towards implementing “home visits” to students during business hours, same-day urgent-care online appointment bookings and expanding same-day visits during certain daytime hours.
This was made with little transparency or regard for student voice. Instead of relying on a task force composed of representatives from HUHS departments (as was done in this case), decisions should include student input from the very beginning.
The presentation of a false dichotomy between Stillman and daytime health services is also cause for concern. Certainly, Dr. Barreira and HUHS should address the perennial requests for same-day mental health services. It is discouraging and dangerous to force students to wait days or even weeks for appropriate therapy. Yet Dr. Barreira has made clear that money was not an issue in the decision to close Stillman. Therefore, there seems to be little reason to not provide both services.
Dr. Barreira claims that only 250 students use Stillman’s services each school year, but these 250 students are still members of our Harvard community, and deserve safety and respect. There should be a space where students can go in the case of medical needs, without first thinking about concerns such as transportation to Mount Auburn. HUHS does well to maintain such a space on campus.
We are glad that UHS and Dr. Barreira have noticed the negative reaction of students to their decision and have reacted accordingly. Hopefully, the force of student outcry will encourage the administration to seek student input more proactively in the future.

The legal defense group Project on Fair Representation announced a lawsuit Monday morning against Harvard University for “employing racially and ethnically discriminatory policies” in its admissions practices, according to a copy of the filed complaint published by a newly formed offshoot of the group.
“Harvard’s undergraduate admissions policies and procedures have injured and continue to injure Plaintiff’s members by intentionally and improperly discriminating against them on the basis of their race and ethnicity in violation of Title VI,” the complaint reads. The complaint cites as the plaintiff Students for Admissions, Inc., a newly formed nonprofit law group that includes students and parents who wish to challenge the use of race in admissions practices, and calls for a permanent injunction on Harvard’s policies they allege are discriminatory.
The suit comes more than six months after Edward Blum, the director of POFR, launched a site seeking students who claim they were not admitted to Harvard because of their race to participate in a potential lawsuit. Similar sites were also launched for students who were denied admission to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A complaint against UNC was also filed on Monday.
“It is especially disconcerting that public data shows that Harvard has purposefully limited the percentage of Asian-American freshman it admits,” Blum wrote in a press release. “In fact, the number of Asian-Americans Harvard admits today is lower than it was 20-years ago, even though the number of highly qualified Asian-American applicants to Harvard has nearly doubled.”
Blum could not be reached for comment on Monday afternoon.
Blum’s comments mirror findings from a 2013 analysis accompanying an opinion piece published in The New York Times of demographic statistics for Harvard’s enrollment data over nearly two decades that may indicate an Asian “quota.” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in March that Harvard does not use quotas in the admissions process.
University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 wrote in a statement that the University’s admissions policies are “fully compliant” with the law.
“In his seminal opinion in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, Justice Powell specially cited to the Harvard College admissions plan in describing a legally sound approach to admissions,” Iuliano wrote Monday afternoon. “Then and now, the College considers each applicant through an individualized, holistic review having the goal of creating a vibrant academic community that exposes students to a wide-range of differences:  background, ideas, experiences, talents and aspirations. The University’s admissions processes remain fully compliant with all legal requirements and are essential to the pedagogical objectives that underlie Harvard’s educational mission.”
The 120-page complaint against Harvard claims that the University uses “racial balancing” in its admissions decisions, even when allegedly “race-neutral alternatives can achieve diversity.” The complaint also detailed a long history of Harvard’s admissions policies, including the widely discussed discrimination of Jewish applicants in the early 20th century and the pushing for a holistic admissions process.
In the past, Blum has helped fund high-profile cases, including the 2013 Fisher vs. University of Texas, challenging affirmative action policies at school. Whereas Abigail Fisher was a white female, the complaint filed Monday focuses on discrimination against Asian-American students.
Students for Fair Admissions has a least one member who was denied admissions to the Harvard College Class of 2018, according to the complaint. That individual is allegedly an Asian-American first generation student who graduated top from his or her high school and achieved score of 36 on the ACT, while participating in several other extracurricular activities.
That same applicant enrolled at a top 20 school, as outlined by U.S. News and World report, that does not preference race or ethnicity in admissions decisions and “intends to seek transfer to Harvard when it ceases the use of race or ethnicity as admissions preference.”

After months of delays, the renowned Boston cannoli and sweets shop Mike’s Pastry opened its second location to much anticipation this past week in Harvard Square.
Though Mike’s received clearance from the city of Cambridge to begin building at 11 Dunster St. in late January, delays involving inspections and the proposed development plan held up the opening for months. The doors finally opened last Thursday morning.
Despite the setbacks, the store has had a “perfect” opening weekend, said Danielle Papa, a supervisor at the Harvard Square location and the daughter of Mike’s general manager Angelo Papa.
“It’s been a long time coming,” Danielle Papa said. “Cambridge is a great great neighborhood...no complaints at all.”
The Harvard Square location, which is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m., has “more of the express to go” style than the North End location, according to Papa. Customers may have to go to the Boston establishment for larger cake orders, but the new branch receives deliveries of baked goods from the main store at least once a day and carries every flavor of the bakery’s signature cannoli, Papa said.
Though Mike’s is an established Boston icon, this is its first store outside of the North End. While there is the possibility of more branches in the future, Papa said she was focused on the “first trial” Cambridge location.
Mike’s Pastry has received positive feedback thus far from the local community.
The Harvard Square Business Association is “just delighted” to welcome the sweet shop to the Square, said Denise A. Jillson, the merchant group’s executive director.
Both Jillson and Papa said the store has had a constant flow of customers since opening , the majority of whom have been students, according to Papa.
Jenni Ting ’15, who visited Mike’s early Monday morning said, “the location is definitely really convenient…. It’s nice not to have to go to the North End. Also I like the space; it was really clean and the staff was nice.”
In addition to being a local favorite, Mike’s is a popular tourist destination,  Jillson said.
“They’re an iconic business, and when people come from out of town, it’s almost like [visiting Mike’s Pastry] is one of the things that you have to do,” Jillson said. “Now folks can come to the Square and not make the trek to the North End to get their pastry.”
Jillson noted that the HBSA has encouraged Harvard Square businesses to stay open later, “but we understand fully that it’s…not an easy request.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Environmental engineering professor John Briscoe, who specialized in water management and received the 2014 Stockholm Water Prize—commonly referred to as “the Nobel Prize of water”—died last Wednesday of cancer. He was 66.
Briscoe earned a Ph.D. in environmental engineering from Harvard in 1976 and returned to Harvard as a faculty member in 2009. He held appointments at the the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School of Public Health, and the Kennedy School of Government. He also directed the Harvard Water Security Initiative.
Originally from South Africa, Briscoe also spent two decades working for the World Bank, where he served as the country director for Brazil, the organization’s biggest borrower. Fluent in five languages, he had extensive experience working in a range of developing countries, including Bangladesh and Mozambique.
In March, he received the 2014 Stockholm Water Prize, a prestigious award for achievement in water policy and administration.
As a professor, Briscoe taught undergraduate and graduate-level water management and development courses and has been nominated for awards in exceptional teaching and mentoring.
Jan-Peter Bockstiegel ’15, who took Briscoe’s course, Environmental Science and Public Policy 10: “Environmental Policy,” remembers the engineer as a helpful and approachable mentor.
“At the end of semester, he invited everyone to his house for a barbeque,” Bockstiegel said, “He left a lot of students with a more hands-on perspective on a lot of the issues we are dealing with.”
Other students agreed. According to Kim Smet, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental engineering, Briscoe always challenged students to think critically.
“He was quick to push people to think beyond the typical answers to a question,” said Smet, who served as Briscoe’s teaching assistant. “You had to be ready on the edge of your seat.”
Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, a Physics professor and former SEAS Dean, said he will miss Briscoe as a friend and a colleague.
“I saw him end of this May…. What was amazing was that even though he knew he had this terrible disease, he was very well-spirited and took life in a very mature and nice way,” Narayanamurti said. “I was just amazed at his fortitude.”
Peter P. Rogers, a professor of environmental engineering, taught Briscoe when he was pursuing his Ph.D. at Harvard. Rogers recalled Briscoe as a “super student” who became a “fantastic teacher."
“I was looking at his teaching reviews from the students, and I remember seeing such glowing reports. He was routinely called ‘the best professor I’ve had at Harvard,’” Rogers said. “[His death] is a sad loss for Harvard and for the water community around the world.”
Briscoe is survived by his wife, four children, and four grandchildren. No memorial service has been scheduled for him to date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Health Services will maintain 24-hour overnight walk-in urgent care, following outcry from students upset about the proposed closure of Stillman Infirmary, UHS Director Paul J. Barreira said Monday at a town hall meeting.
While Stillman is still slated to close in 2014, eliminating overnight respite beds, Barreira said that UHS will continue to offer in-person medical services such as triage, urgent care treatment, and on-site alcohol assessments at night.
Barreira said this compromise provides students a physical space to seek medical help at night while still freeing up valuable clinical space and resources for the planned expansion of same-day appointments and mental health services. He said that UHS is constrained to its current space because clinical space must meet government regulation.
He also said he had toured every campus building but found that none met requirements for clinical space. Barreira estimated a new building for UHS would cost about $80 million.
Barreira delivered the news, which had been expected since Monday, during a town hall meeting in which he fielded questions about how upcoming changes to health services would affect students. He noted that the latest news would be detailed to the community in an email following the meeting.
At the town hall, Barreira and other members of UHS, many of whom were part of the task force that recommended Stillman’s closure, said that the decision was also made for budgetary purposes, in order to redistribute resources to other services.
“If I could expand space and keep Stillman, wonderful. If I could increase our money, I would…. I had no options to avoid that kind of difficult equation,” Barreira said, explaining that UHS’s budget is exclusively comprised of the student health fee and premiums paid by those on its insurance plan.
“We didn’t start out by saying how can we save money, but how can we expand services?” UHS Chief of Medicine Soheyla Gharib said.
Several of the 40 students in attendance questioned the changes and requested more details about its potential impact on student health.
Some dwelled on the need for respite beds on campus, and shared their personal experiences at Stillman. Rachael C. Stein ’17, a member of the women’s varsity rugby team, said the on-campus respite beds had played a vital role in her recovery from surgery for injuries, and that many of her teammates have had similar experiences.
According to the UHS representatives present, the University is considering options for students in similar situations. They said, though, that maintaining fewer respite beds was not an option, as it would require the same amount of resources as providing the ten beds currently in Stillman.
In response to concerns regarding the cost of ambulance rides to Mt. Auburn Hospital, Gharib said UHS is exploring possibilities, such as providing transportation through Harvard University Police Department for students who would not require the presence of medical staff.
However, from conversations with the Cambridge Fire Department, Gharib said Harvard is unlikely to be able to offer an internal ambulance service or rely on Crimson EMS, the student-run first-responder campus organization.
Medical Director of Stillman Infirmary Donald Perlo noted that UHS was working closely with Mt. Auburn to streamline the process for students transferred to the hospital, including those who might require respite beds there.
Some students also criticized the manner in which the decision was made. Faith A. Jackson ’16, candidate for Undergraduate Council vice president, asked whether UHS would change its decision-making process to incorporate student input earlier.
Barreira said he would not.
“I have to talk to the professionals first. Then we can go forward…. And then, that’s when it becomes a community conversation, a matter of public debate,” he said. He also noted that he could not imagine asking students to participate in the design of the program, as they lacked the expertise and are unauthorized to view confidential medical information.
The Town Hall was organized by the Undergraduate Council and HealthPALs, a campus liaison group between students and UHS. A second town hall on the health care changes is planned for Wednesday.

Dignitaries from Saudi Arabia and Israel discussed the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and how the world should move forward from the turmoil at a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum panel event on Monday night at the Institute of Politics.
The discussion, moderated by Belfer Center Director and Kennedy School Professor Graham T. Allison ’62, centered around international relations and sources of tension in the region, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Iran, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
His Royal Highness Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the former Saudi Arabian ambassador to the U.S., said that even with the massive scale of casualties, countries are only concerned with managing the crisis, not ending it entirely.
“They are focused on scoring points in a tennis match, rather than concluding the match,” he said.
Dan Meridor, former Israeli deputy prime minister and minister of intelligence and atomic energy, emphasized the role of religious differences in many of the conflicts in the region, such as the conflict between Shia and Sunni Muslim combatants. He said it was important for countries to work together and develop solutions that take these differences into account.
“I think the Middle East is in for a major political, historical revolution,” Meridor said. “We’re not at the end of the storm. We’re in the eye of the storm.”
Al-Faisal particularly said he was concerned that providing Iran with uranium enrichment capabilities might lead other countries in the region to demand those same capabilities, potentially leading to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world.
Amidst talk of war and tension, both panelists highlighted the possible benefits of cooperation between their two nations.
“Saudi Arabia and Israel are countries of stability, and can do more together to help stability take its place [in the region],” Meridor said.
Ali A. Hakim ’18, a writer for the Harvard Political Review who has reported on Middle Eastern affairs in the past, said he was drawn to the event by the distinguished panelists and the topic of discussion.
“It’s not often that you get to see representatives from those two states in a dialogue like this,” he said.
Hakim said he liked how Meridor and Al-Faisal balanced out their disagreements with the consensus that unity between the two nations was needed to support the unsteady atmosphere in the region.
“At the end of the day they were both unhappy with the level of cooperation that had been reached between Saudi Arabia and Israel,” he said.

A Harvard neuroscience professor has found that children of the indigenous population of the central Andes have been exposed to dangerously high levels of lead and mercury through the breast milk of their mothers.
After publishing the results of his study in July, S. Allen Counter, Jr., a clinical professor of neurology at the Medical School and Director of the Harvard Foundation, has led efforts to mitigate lead poisoning through education.
“I would go into villages and the children would come out to see me,” Counter said. “As they would greet me, these beautiful little children would smile and they had black stains in their teeth.”
Counter assembled a team of doctors and nurses from the U.S. and Ecuador to conduct the study, which found that most of the children and the adults in many Ecuadorian Andean villages, all at elevations of around 12,000 feet or higher, had lead poisoning as well as high levels of mercury in their blood.
According to Counter, the exposure to these toxic metals originates from the villagers’ livelihoods. Most of the young women earn their income by digging lead out of old car batteries. The metal can then be ground  up and used to glaze ceramics, such as roof tiles, that can be sold to make a living.
“We look at some of the lead isotopes and by examining the types of lead, we can match the lead in the soil, in the food, in the battery, and in the children’s blood as all being the same lead,” Counter said. “We know it all came from the same source.”
To remedy this issue, Counter has launched the Lead Education Prevention Program, which educates local residents about the dangers of lead batteries and suggests alternative livelihoods for the villagers. Simultaneously, he has been raising funds for medicine that can significantly lower lead levels in the blood.
The study found a clear correlation with the levels of lead in Quechua mothers’ blood, their breast-milk, and the infants’ blood level. In many cases, these levels in children are extraordinarily high considering their limited exposure.
“It was unbelievable,” Counter said of the levels of lead detected in the children’s blood samples. He found over 100 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood in some cases, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention places a person at risk if levels reach even 5 micrograms per deciliter.
Counter found that these elevated lead levels have serious neurocognitive effects.
“We followed some of the children over the years, and sadly we’ve seen evidence of a serious correlation, as we had predicted, between the level of lead exposure and an intellectual deficit and cognitive decline,” he said.
Most recently, he and other villagers met with Ecuador’s Minister of Health, who has approved the construction of a day care center in the most contaminated village. This way, mothers can drop off their children while they work to prevent any further exposure.
“I really am concerned,” Counter said. “I want to see these communities brought to good health.”

While humans and birds possess one set of genitalia, snakes and lizards both develop two sets of genitalia, prompting the question of why such differences occur. In a recent study, researchers at Harvard Medical School discovered that, across different animal species, genitalia formation is influenced by developments that occur during early embryonic growth. Genitalia development, according to the study, is closely linked to the growth and presence of limbs in animals such as snakes, lizards, and birds.
“Although it is well known that, during development, limbs and genitalia share common genetic and molecular regulatory networks underlying their formation, how they are connected to each other during evolution has remained a conundrum,” said Jérome Gros, co-senior author of the study and assistant professor of Developmental and Stem Cell Biology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.
Gros and HMS Genetics research fellow Patrick Tschopp conducted the study and served as senior co-authors, under the supervision of HMS’s Genetics departmental head Clifford J. Tabin.
The researchers used a method known as “lineage tracing” to track the development of different cell populations in various animal embryos. They also used RNA-sequencing to compare the molecular structures of the mouse and lizard tissues where genitalia were located.
Gros explained that the researchers became interested in studying genitalia after they completed a 2010 study of the cellular processes underlying limblessness in snakes. The researchers compared what happens in snakes to mouse and chick embryo limb formation, a comparison that was later drawn in the genitalia study, as well.
“Very quickly, we realized that by looking at squamate (snake and lizard) embryos…we could indeed gain insights into external genitalia formation and evolution,” Gros said.
Differences in genitalia formation, as the researchers discovered, is most likely the result of the location of the cloaca, an embryonic part of the developing gut in animals. After experimenting with moving the cloaca to various locations in the animal tissue through grafting, the researchers confirmed that the location of the cloaca determines the site for genitalia formation. When the cloaca is located near the limb bud, as in snakes and lizards, that is where the genitalia form, while a cloaca located near a tail bud becomes the site for genetilia formation in mammals.
The development of genitalia in animals, according to the study, is connected to the location of limb development. Both anatomical features share similar genetic processes in development, which were potentially tied to a deeper ancestral origin at one point.
Moving forward, Tschopp hopes to analyze the time period in which such similarities persisted in limb and genital development in snakes, and also understand what might have induced the cloacal shift across different species.

Harvard recognized 90 years of the Farlow Reference Library and Herbarium of Cryptogamic Botany Thursday evening. To honor the moment, former interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister introduced the audience to a few of the collections out of the millions of specimens in the Herbarium, which include Antarctic lichens and fungi from Asia.
Pfister spoke to a crowd of around 200 people in the Geological Lecture Hall and began with deciphering the title of the Herbarium—cryptogams are organisms that are spore-producing.
As current curator of Farlow Herbarium and celebrated fungi enthusiast, Pfister provided a brief history of its beginnings and its founder William G. Farlow.
“One of the most interesting things with theses collections, is to look at them and realize that these are human endeavours,” said Pfister of the collection the herbarium houses. “Somebody went to the far ends of the Earth, and while they were there they collected organisms and brought them back, and documented them.”
Pfister highlighted the variety of specimens available for research or public enjoyment at the Herbarium on Divinity Ave. Though generally dried and kept away from insects to ensure their longevity, the samples can be rehydrated by botanists to study their natural form. The general public can also enjoy the museum by observing samples such as the lichens used for Egyptian mummification and embalming, or other specimens that facilitate the mummification process for caterpillars and fruit.
Beyond research and entertainment, Pfister emphasized the relevance of these specimens, and the importance of their study both in the past and future. In particular, he mentioned the tragedy of the 19th century Irish potato famine, caused by a microbe.
“A lot of these organisms are not the kind of organisms that people are always familiar with; they are not huge like trees, or they are not those charismatic animals that usually people love,” said Diana Munn, director of public programs for the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. “These are organisms that are found in nature that are really small, but play key roles in ecosystems.”
The audience was able to view a part of the collections discussed during a reception that followed.

A Harvard-affiliated scientist and a professor of Mathematics at Harvard received $3 million apiece as recipients of the Breakthrough Prizes in Fundamental Physics and Life Sciences.
Gary Ruvkun, a genetics professor at the Medical School and a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Jacob Lurie, who also won a MacArthur genius grant this year, received these honors from a panel of Silicon Valley executives, who founded the award in 2012.
The awards were given to 12 recipients in in the celebrity-studded “Breakthrough Prize Ceremony” on Nov. 9.
“They have good taste,” said Ruvkun of the panel, which includes Facebook co-founder and Harvard dropout Mark Zuckerberg. “They understand that math and science are really important and really important for what they do.”
Lurie gained recognition for his contributions to higher category theory, derived algebraic geometry, and several advanced facets of topology.
Ruvkun has been working both independently and in tandem with Victor Ambros, a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, to understand tiny pieces of genetic material that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. Just 22 nucleotides long, these “microRNA” molecules regulate the production of proteins. While they serve an important function, they seemed at first to be “a little quirk of nature,” Ruvkun said of their initial identification of the first microRNA molecule in 1993.
The technology boom of the last two decades was responsible for Ruvkun’s “Breakthrough Prize,” in more than one way, he said. The rise of big data in the form of the Human Genome Project, which set out to unravel the entire genetic makeup of humans, facilitated the success of Ruvkun and Ambros’s findings in the scientific community. In 2000, the researchers discovered a second microRNA, at a time when 30 percent of the human genome had been decoded and the DNA sequence was being updated and shared constantly.
“At that point it just exploded,” Ruvkun said. “You don’t plan for those kinds of things, for thousands of people to be reading my work.”
With readily available information on the human genome from the Human Genome Project, Ruvkun and his lab determined that gene regulation at the small scale of microRNA molecules was widely applicable across many animals, including humans. The number of articles on microRNAs shot up from two in 1993 to nearly 35,000 today.
“It’s really just luck,” Ruvkun said. “There’s a lot of good science today that’s not that lucky.”
The 12 honorees ranged from astronomers to life scientists to mathematicians, spanning both theoretical and experimental projects. They celebrated the awards at a gala hosted by Seth MacFarlane in Mountain View, Calif.

Around 150 members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and Harvard faculty gathered in the Science Center on Monday afternoon to discuss strategies for improving employee health while keeping health care affordable.
The panel, sponsored by HUCTW, comes just weeks after Harvard faculty members unanimously passed a motion to ask the University administration to reverse recent changes to employee health benefits. Since, President Drew G. Faust committed to keeping the new benefits package amid faculty opposition. Although the plan only affects nonunion employees, many HUCTW members have been vocal in the healthcare debate and have expressed concern about the new plan.
Still, organizers said the panel was not aimed to address these controversial changes.
“We weren’t aiming to make huge political points with this,” said HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger. “We really did plan it and intend it as an opportunity for people to learn together and try to advance some ideas as a community.”
The panelists presented different ideas for reducing healthcare costs, although all three warned against deductibles, one of the new controversial additions in the University’s new health benefits plan for nonunion employees.
“I am personally opposed to join[ing] the race to the bottom, otherwise known as adopting high deductible plans, encouraging people to be underinsured, in my opinion, or shifting more cost to employees,” said Executive Director of the Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission Dolores L. Mitchell, one of the panelists.
Harvard Medical School clinical instructor and panelist Rushika Fernandopulle argued that health plans should focus on enhancing primary care to reduce costs, saying that only 4 percent of U.S. healthcare dollars are spent on primary care, while the other 96 percent are spent on visits to specialists, emergency rooms, and hospitals.
“Let’s take away barriers to primary care like copays,” Fernandopulle said. “Why are we putting a barrier for people to come to primary care? Stop that madness.”
The speakers explained that effective health care policy at Harvard in particular will require a combination of many of the ideas presented at the panel.
“There’s no solution out there that we’re all ignoring,” Harvard School of Public Health professor Meredith Rosenthal said. “It’s a whole lot of small changes that are locally appropriate and appropriate to our values in health benefits and everything else.”
Though the panel discussion did not explicitly address the recent health benefits changes, several attendees said the issue weighed heavily on their minds. Kennedy School employee and HUCTW member Missouri Ammons expressed concern about the plan’s potential implications for employees.
“I can appreciate that healthcare is very expensive,” Ammons said after the panel. “I do think that it doesn’t create any long-term benefit to put more costs on employees for various reasons, especially when Harvard is the employer. I know we have to watch our budget, but we are not strapped.”

With widely varying approaches to club endorsements and campaign overhead, tickets in this year’s Undergraduate Council presidential elections are bringing visibly different philosophies to campaigning.
Two pairs, Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 and Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16, have maintained polished websites, with each campaign enlisting 20 or more official campaign staffers.  The remaining tickets have intentionally chosen a different path, however, with Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 and Ema H. Horvath ’16 favoring a low-budget campaign and Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17 emphasizing spontaneous interaction with students.
That difference in strategy also comes across in official endorsements. The Nasrollahzadeh-Goyal and Yang-Jackson tickets have secured multiple endorsements from clubs, ranging from political to cultural groups. Meanwhile, Heine and Turban have received no endorsements, and Kanuparthy and Horvath have only garnered The Crimson editorial staff’s endorsement.
“Definitely [club endorsements] are a very important part of the campaign because they have really active member[s], and we stand for issues that these clubs care about,” Yang said, noting that her ticket received endorsements from several clubs, including the Asian American Association, Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever, Harvard Republican Club, and Latinas Unidas.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said they have also received endorsements from many student organizations, including Harvard Financial Analysts Club, the Association of Black Harvard Women, Woodbridge International Society, and the women’s squash team.
Heine and Turban, on the other hand, have no registered campaign organizers, do not host a site, and have sought out no club endorsements.
“This is our biggest advantage. We have an incredibly fast feedback loop where we’re not depending on anyone,” Turban said.
The two said they were focusing more on individual communication with students. The pair printed and distributed several hundred copies of lecture notes for the course Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” on Monday, with additional information printed at the end informing students how to vote for them.
“Clubs are a weaker voting bloc than people think they are,” Turban said, describing his campaign’s preference for interactions with individual students.
Kanuparthy also questioned the value of courting electoral support from clubs, noting that endorsements may or may not reflect the strength of a campaign's platform.
“Endorsements are a favorites game. If you know the president of a club, you might get the endorsement, which is what it is,” he said, adding that he and Horvath are running a “very low-key” campaign.
The two “very intentional[ly]” decided against hosting a site beyond a Facebook page, because “no one uses it, apart from The Crimson,” Kanuparthy said. He and Horvath have about three registered organizers on their campaign, and have only spent $15 in campaign costs, according to the UC Election Commission.
All tickets are allocated $225 to spend in this year’s elections. Heine and Turban have reported about $200 in current or planned expenditures, including fines. Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal have listed about $150, but said they may not use a large banner that accounts for $93 of their posted expenses. Yang and Jackson have listed $80 in costs.

A Department of Education investigation into Harvard’s response to a sexual harassment case at the Medical School led the school to change how it handled such allegations in 2008, according to federal documents recently obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The investigation, which was previously unreported, came in response to one of at least 18 Title IX complaints filed against Harvard and reviewed by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights since 2002. A Crimson review of federal documents released by OCR in response to a FOIA request found that most of those complaints did not lead to full federal investigations into Harvard’s compliance with Title IX, an anti-sex discrimination law; two, against the College and the Law School, prompted investigations that remain ongoing.
The set of OCR documents details the outcomes of more than 7,500 Title IX complaints received and closed by the federal office between Jan. 1, 2002 and Sept. 22, 2014. Among Ivy League schools, Harvard and Columbia saw the most complaints during this time period, with 16 closed complaints each.
Complaints filed with OCR that actually lead to changes in policies are relatively rare. According to the documents, OCR closes and dismisses a significant majority of Title IX complaints against schools even before they reach the investigatory stage. Of the 83 complaints filed against Ivy League schools after Jan. 1, 2002 and closed by Sept. 22, 2014, 14 prompted OCR to open formal investigations, but only two yielded policy changes. That number does not include any ongoing cases.
{filterable_table id=1301895 size=large caption=true}
The 2008 probe at Harvard Medical School is the only closed case that prompted the University to change its policies during this time period.
The speedy resolution of the case, in which Harvard voluntarily changed its procedures to expedite the grievance process just months after OCR launched its investigation, stands in contrast to the years-long probe at Harvard Law School, which the government opened in response to a complaint filed in 2010.
The 2008 case involved a female student’s allegation that the Medical School had failed to adequately respond to her sexual harassment complaint against a faculty member. According to letters that OCR sent to University officials regarding the investigation, the student alleged that it took Harvard close to two years to investigate her case and an additional 10 months for Harvard to make a final decision on her subsequent appeal.
The complainant alleged that she was harassed and assaulted by an assistant professor while she worked in his Harvard Medical School laboratory as an undergraduate, according to her March 2008 letter to OCR. In particular, the complainant took issue with Harvard’s response to her allegation of harassment and claimed that Harvard had inappropriately returned a handful of intimate photographs to the professor against the recommendations of the Medical School’s faculty grievance panel.
The names of both the complainant and the accused professor are redacted in the copy of the complaint released by OCR.
Just a month after receiving the complaint, OCR informed University President Drew G. Faust in an April 2008 letter that it had launched an investigation into whether Harvard had “failed to respond promptly” to the sexual harassment complaint. OCR then requested that Harvard provide the office with a copy of the student’s original complaint, a “detailed description” of how the University responded to that complaint, and information about Harvard’s policies and procedures governing sexual assault and harassment.
OCR ultimately closed its investigation in Aug. 2008, after Harvard agreed to adjust its policies to resolve the issue. Specifically, in an Aug. 2008 letter, Ellen F. Berkman ’86 of Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel informed OCR investigators that the Medical School and the School of Dental Medicine would change their procedures to resolve the complaint. Among other points, Berkman wrote that Harvard was committed to changing the two schools’ formal complaint procedure. Such sexual harassment complaints would go to a three-person faculty grievance panel and would be resolved within six months after the accused party responded to the initial complaint.
According to a letter informing Faust of the case’s closure, OCR had interviewed “key administrators” involved in the implementation of Harvard’s grievance process as part of the investigation. Throughout the interview process, legal counsel “expressed an interest in resolving the complaint,” according to the letter, because while Harvard “believed that its grievance process was extremely thorough and fair, it had already evaluated the procedure and was looking into possible changes that could be implemented to make the process more prompt.”
Gina Vild, a Medical School spokesperson, confirmed that the school changed its policies in 2008 in response to the Title IX investigation. The school’s faculty council approved the current procedures in Nov. 2008, which still apply to complaints against faculty members today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 19, 2014, 1:40 a.m.
The names of 48 seniors elected to Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter were released Monday by Jeffrey Berg, assistant director at the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships.
Election to the Senior 48 list is based largely on an individual’s academic performance as well as courseload difficulty and diversity. The selection follows the announcement last spring of the society’s Junior 24 list, which recognized two dozen members of the Class of 2015 for extraordinary academic achievement.
Five of the seniors concentrate in Social Studies, which was the most common major among the inductees. Yet many of the seniors elected are sole representatives of their concentration, including inductees from English, Physics, and African and African American Studies, among others. Inductees from Kirkland and Quincy Houses outnumbered those from other Houses, with each House contributing seven students each.
“It’s such a thrill,” said Merrill H. Lutsky ’15, an applied math concentrator in Eliot. “Just to be considered among [people who are] so fantastically talented is such a great honor and highlight of my time here. I never really set out to do this, but it was more of something that fell into place term after term. I don’t think you should set out to optimize your concentration for your GPA.”
English concentrator Amy C. Robinson ’15, who lives in Dunster House, said she appreciated her nomination and noted that students studying writing often pursue diverse academic paths.
“What I love about people that study creative writing at Harvard is that they do so much more beyond it and they can integrate other studies into creative writing work,” Robinson said. “People don't often realize all of these [concentrators] who are doing creative writing theses are also studying physics and doing the pre-med track and taking economics classes.”
Many students traced their success back to the classroom and campus. Sharon Zhou ’15, a joint classics and computer science concentrator, attributed much of her achievements to those around her.
“I feel like people underestimate the impact of other people on themselves,” Zhou said. “Without the influence of professors, without being surrounded by particularly insightful and talented friends, I probably wouldn't have been able to do what I have. When I got [the email notifying me of my selection] I felt like, ‘This is a representation of how great the people around me are.’ I did well in school because I was really inspired by the people around me.”
Despite the prestige of the selection, some students were ambivalent about what their election to the chapter actually means.
“I think it's an honor to be able to get [elected], but I'm not sure what exactly it signifies. It doesn't prescribe my success for the future,” said Yuechen Zhao ’15, a computer science concentrator in Leverett.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Break out your paint, markers, colored pencils, and posters. College GameDay is coming to The Game.
On Sunday, ESPN announced that its weekly three-hour college football preview show will broadcast on the quad outside Dillon Field House before the undefeated Harvard football team faces Yale for the 131st time this Saturday, Nov. 22. The live show will air from 9 a.m. to noon EST.
Tapings for other ESPN programs will take place on Friday on the GameDay set and continue periodically throughout the day until 2:30 p.m.
GameDay’s appearances at Harvard and the Game will be firsts for the Emmy Award-winning program, which is in its 28th season. The show will be hosted by Chris Fowler alongside analysts Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstriet, Desmond Howard and David Pollack, and reporting by Samantha Ponder, Tom Rinaldi, Scott Van Pelt, George Whitfield, and Gene Wojciechowski.
GameDay is the top-rated pre-game program for college football and averaged 1.83 million viewers during the 2013 season. The show features a tailgate party atmosphere in which hundreds of fans armed with colorful signs gather behind the main cameras.
Harvard last appeared on GameDay in 2002, when the Crimson faced off against UPenn in Philadelphia. Saturday will be only the second time the program has covered an Ivy League game.
On Saturday, the Crimson (9-0, 6-0 Ivy) will have a chance to clinch the outright Ivy title and finish its first undefeated season since 2004. A Yale (8-1, 5-1 Ivy) win would force Harvard to share the Ancient Eight crown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard coed sailing team finished its fall season this Sunday, capturing an 11th place result at the Atlantic Coast Championship.
“The weekend was a mixed bag,” junior co-captain Andrew Mollerus said. “On the one hand, we weren't capable of this result a year ago.  As a team and individually, we have all made big strides over the past six months and it has clearly showed.”
The event, hosted by the Coast Guard on the Thames River, brought together 19 schools which competed in FJs. The United States Naval Academy, Boston College, and the University of Vermont took the top three spots.
Mollerus was joined by co-captain and classmate Sydney Karnovsky in the B division, where the Crimson posted its best finish of the weekend in seventh place. Senior Brian Drumm and junior Jacob Bradt took 10th place in the A division.
“On the other hand, we did not sail well at all this weekend,” Mollerus said. “On numerous fundamental points, we broke down and gave ground to our opponents where we shouldn't have.”
Bradt echoed Mollerus’ overall disappointment in the way the team’s season ended.
“Generally, I don't think that we felt as though we performed at the level that we know we are capable of,” Bradt said. “It leaves a bit of a sour taste in our mouths going into the offseason.”
Saturday presented rather unpredictable winds, but only one protest was filed that resulted in a disqualification. Although the wind on Sunday was far less strong, the day still witnessed a protest that brought about another disqualification of a team on the water.
Gaining a spot in the championship regatta demonstrated the great potential of the Harvard team, which put significant focus into preparing for the races.
“The mentality was simple this weekend: show up and turn up,” Mollerus said.
Despite feeling like the team didn’t perform at its highest potential, the sailors nevertheless took a lot positives from the regatta.
“I think that overall, the weekend was a success,” Bradt said. “It showed that we can remain a relevant player at top-level events, which is certainly an improvement from past regattas.”
Echoing Bradt’s tone of improvement, Karnovsky is already regrouping her squad for the spring season that begins in March.
“Looking forward, we plan to spend the off months meeting as a team to refine our knowledge of team racing,” Karnovsky said. “We want to continue to get in good shape so that we can hit the spring season ready to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s go through what we know first, and then we can talk about why none of it matters much.
1. The Harvard football team is your 2014 Ivy League champion. With a 34-24 win over Penn Saturday, the Crimson clinched a share of coach Tim Murphy’s eighth Ivy title and moved one game away from a perfect season.
2. Junior Paul Stanton’s 235 rushing yards in the game provided another historical moment this season. He carried the team and still managed to outrun Quaker defenders, finishing with the most rushing yards since 1997 and the most all-purpose yards in the Murphy era.
3. Harvard’s defense had its worst day of the year numerically, surrendering more points than it had in the three previous weeks combined, but it held when it needed to.
Late in the third quarter, Penn had driven to the Harvard 20-yard line, already up by seven. The shade was creeping across Franklin Field as the Crimson’s hopes of an undefeated season dimmed.
On second down, sophomore defensive end Miles McCollum was forced to play coverage against a no-huddle attack. He did so admirably, forcing an incompletion. Junior defensive back Chris Evans then perfectly defended a fade in the end zone, leading to a field goal attempt—which was blocked.
The Crimson did not allow another first down after that point while its offense scored three times to eviscerate what was a seven-point Quakers lead. The rest might be history.
But here is where we get to the “but.”
Week 10. Yale. The Game.
Three years ago, the Bulldogs reorganized their program with a single goal in mind: beating Harvard. They swiped Crimson coaches, recreated Murphy’s system—camo hats and all—and brought in transfers at quarterback and running back to speed up the recovery process.
Now, they are a game away from completing the plan. Yale enters Saturday 8-1, 5-1 in league play, with its lone loss coming by seven points to Dartmouth on a late touchdown.
But that was just a loss in a game—fractionally as significant as a potential loss in The Game.
I’m looking forward to asking Harvard players how they would feel sharing the championship with Yale during media availability Wednesday, though I bet I can already imagine what they will say.
I bet members of the 1974 and 1968 teams would have similar thoughts. Those are the only two years Harvard and Yale have split the title since 1956, though the Crimson lost neither of those Games.
On the other side, Yale entered The Game in 2007 looking to complete an unbeaten season, and Harvard won, 37-6, to steal the Ivy title outright (the Crimson has actually kept the Bulldogs from finishing unblemished the last four times they entered The Game 9-0).
Since then, Harvard has gone 59-11 and claimed four more championships while Yale went 37-22. The Crimson has also not lost in The Game since. That’s the kind of long-term impact these matchups can have when the stakes are as high as they will be Saturday.
But throw Harvard’s seven-game winning streak against the Bulldogs in the Charles River; it’s worthless now. If Yale wins Saturday, they will own the rivalry for at least a year.
Regardless of the reality, it will feel like a Crimson collapse and a Blue ascent to however many thousands pack the Stadium if the Elis emerge victorious this weekend. And they very well could.
Harvard enters The Game as a consensus favorite thanks to its unblemished record, No. 14 national ranking, and host status. But Yale has the talent—especially considering Crimson quarterback Conner Hempel remains a game-time decision.
Bulldogs quarterback Morgan Roberts leads the league in passing while running back Tyler Varga leads it in rushing. He has also scored 20 touchdowns in nine games. Both pro prospects, they could be the best two offensive players in the league. And before they compete against each other for Player of the Year honors, they will be on the same side against Harvard.
If the Crimson wins an eighth straight Game, it will cement this stretch as Harvard’s most dominant in the history of The Game.For that to come at the end of an undefeated season would only further ensure this group’s place in Crimson history. Beating back a revived Yale program would only be icing. Doing it with College GameDay on hand would be extra icing.
The Crimson knows this. The team danced on the Penn sideline, celebrating another Ivy title. But then everybody got back to business.
The players know their work is not complete. The job is not done. These Harvard players will always be champions. But Saturday, they have an opportunity to become more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­No pressure, no diamonds. On Saturday at Franklin Field, the Crimson found its own diamond in junior running back Paul Stanton, who rushed for a career-high 235 yards in a 34-24 thriller victory against Penn.
Stanton started Harvard off strong, running 42 yards to score a touchdown less than two minutes into the first quarter.
Going into the second quarter, the Crimson (9-0, 6-0 Ivy) trailed the Quakers (1-8, 1-5), who already had a field goal and touchdown on the board. For the second time that day, Stanton gave Harvard the lead, dashing 75 yards for another score.
The Crimson again slipped during the third quarter, and Harvard found itself down, 24-17, with 15 minutes left in the game. After a touchdown scored by senior tight end Tyler Hamblin followed by a field goal, Stanton propelled the Crimson even closer to the win with his third touchdown.
“We talk all the time about expecting adversity [and] embracing adversity, the twists and turns a game like this could take,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I’ve got to hand it to our kids. They just willed this thing.”
Stanton’s 276 all-purpose yards and 235 rushing yards mark a record in his collegiate career, and his performance represented the fourth highest rushing yard total for a single game in program history.
Stanton’s game-making performances in 2014 are nothing new. Last year, he led Harvard in rushing yards with 936 and scored 17 touchdowns—totals that were good enough for third and second in the Ivy League, respectively.
He has managed to build on those accomplishments this year, with 881 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns.
“I really have to give credit to my offensive line,” Stanton said in reference to the Penn game. “They blocked great all game long. I really owe it up to them.”
With all his success this season, it is hard to believe that the running back started off the season on the bench with an injury suffered during preseason.
After missing games against Holy Cross and Georgetown, Stanton has certainly settled back into his role, scoring at least one touchdown in every game he’s played since his return.
Stanton has also received numerous accolades for his contributions to Harvard’s success. A headliner performance at Dartmouth on Nov. 1 earned him the Ancient Eight Co-Offensive Player of the Week award—an honor he has taken home multiple times in his Harvard career—as well as the NEFWA Gold Helmet.
But even before the start of this season, after his crucial role last year, the running back was already designated as a key component Harvard’s offense. Stanton was named to multiple preseason watch lists and was one of a number of Harvard players tagged with preseason first team All-Ivy honors.
These accomplishments have earned the respect of rival players and coaches alike, including Penn coach Al Bagnoli, who ranks second in Ancient Eight history with 111 career wins.
“[Stanton is] a terrific player,” said Bagnoli, who will retire at the end of this season. “He gets in the open field, he’s pretty elusive, and he’s a kid that certainly can make you miss [the tackle]. [He] has enough speed that he can take it all the way for a touchdown.”
In fact, such awards and praise go back all the way to high school. As a team captain his senior year, Stanton led Jesuit High School in New Orleans, La., to an undefeated season. He also ranked third all-time in school history for touchdowns in a season (21) and in a game (four).
If Stanton can come even close to a repeat of his Penn performance this Saturday against Yale, he would put his team in excellent position to compete for sole possession of the Ivy League title.
And while the various awards, recognition, and NFL-related bluster accumulated by players like Stanton have led to heightened media attention—including the presence of College GameDay on campus this weekend for The Game—the running back and others have remained focused on the task at hand while helping the Crimson to a perfect 9-0 record thus far.
“Paul’s just so humble,” Murphy said. “He’s an amazing football player, he’s got a lot of talent, but he’s also got tremendous heart [and] tremendous mental toughness.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­It has been a heartbreaking two days for Harvard basketball. Four miles and 25 hours after the men’s team fell in the final seconds against Holy Cross, the women’s squad (1-1, 0-0 Ivy) lost a 63-62 road contest against Boston University (1-1, 0-0 Patriot).
With 4.8 seconds left and the ball under the Terriers’ basket on Tuesday night, the Crimson had one final chance to finish off its opponents. Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith drew up an inbounds play for senior forward Temi Fagbenle.
Just seconds later, the horn sounded without Harvard getting off a shot in time as the team could not gain control of the inbounds pass.
“We were just hoping to get it in to Temi for an easy layup or shot close to the basket,” co-captain Erin McDonnell said. “We were all anticipating that rebound and trying to crash and put it back in the last few seconds.”
Fagbenle and McDonnell led the way for a balanced the Harvard attack as the duo combined for 24 points and 24 rebounds. Seven players scored at least six points for the Crimson.
But the story of the game was the resilience of BU. The early moments saw Harvard jump out to an 12-0 lead, as the team hit five of its first seven shots and its first two three-pointers.
Even though the Crimson offense cooled off over the remainder of the first half, the visiting team managed to maintain its double-digit lead. Intermission seemed to bring an entirely new Terrier team to Case Gym.
The beginning of the second half looked very similar to Harvard’s final frame against Colgate in the season opener, which saw the Crimson allow the Raiders to stay in the game for much of the second half.
“We definitely want to eliminate that M.O. of being a first half team and a second half team,” McDonnell said. “I think that the big focus for us is to recognize that [giving up leads] keeps happening to us, be aware of it, and just dig even deeper and stick to our fundamentals, and be that much more detail-oriented in those moments up by 15.”
BU trimmed Harvard’s 12-point halftime lead to five before the first media timeout of the second half. Following this hot start, the Terriers always had an answer for the Crimson in the second half.
A pair of sophomores led the charge for BU, as forward Meghan Green tallied 19 points and guard Courtney Latham seemed to drive past the Harvard defense and finish with her left hand every time it looked like Harvard was pulling away.
The Terriers rode the momentum of its home crowd and a strong inside game to take a 53-51 lead with four minutes left, and the hosts finished the contest with 40 points in the paint.
But the Crimson struggled to get high-percentage shots inside after the first few minutes of the game and shot 29 percent from the field after intermission while allowing BU to shoot 52 percent.
“They just came at our throats and were attacking us, and they were driving hard at us,” McDonnell said. “We didn’t have early rotations and were just getting beat to the basket way too easily.”
After junior guard Kit Metoyer hit a three to cut the Terrier lead to one, the teams began a pattern of trading baskets that would last for the rest of the game. Harvard would trim the lead to one; BU would get it back to three.
Delaney-Smith called a timeout with her team down one with 26.5 seconds left and a chance to take the lead. After the Terriers intentionally fouled with 15 seconds on the clock, a flurry of passes led to junior guard Shilpa Tummala’s pass inside to Fagbenle being deflected out of bounds, setting up the Crimson’s final chance.
“Temi makes that shot nine times out of ten,” Metoyer said. “We all gave her a pat on the back because we expect that to go in and so does she. We definitely have so much confidence in each other and in ourselves as teammates that whoever is taking the shot, that’s who we want taking it. And whether it goes in or it doesn’t, we’ll deal with that afterwards.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Good news comes in pairs for the Harvard football team.
A day after learning that ESPN’s College GameDay would set up shop in Cambridge for the annual Harvard-Yale game, the Crimson was promoted to No. 14 in the FCS Coaches Poll. The ranking marks the team’s highest since 2011, when Harvard claimed an outright Ivy League title.
At 9-0, the Crimson is one of two undefeated teams in the FCS. The other, Coastal Carolina, inhabits first place in the Coaches Poll after a 52-21 shellacking of Monmouth last Saturday.
An unblemished record is not the only attribute that distinguishes this season’s Harvard squad. Of the 121 teams in FCS football, Harvard boasts the stingiest scoring defense, allowing a measly 11.0 points per game.
In particular, the Crimson excels at stopping the run. By holding opposing rushers to an average of 2.64 yards per carry, Harvard has forged the second-best running defense in the nation. The team has allowed 82.6 yards per game and a national low of six touchdowns.
Success against running backs has led to general statistical excellence. The Crimson ranks second in first downs allowed and ninth in total yards conceded per game.
All this is not to downplay the strength of Harvard’s offense. Headlined by junior Paul Stanton, the Crimson running attack has accumulated 233 yards per game, good for the 15th most efficient ground game in the FCS. The team has reached at least 34 points in five of nine games.
National exceptionality has a precedent in the 2011 Harvard team. After a 30-22 loss at Holy Cross to open the season, the Crimson ripped off nine consecutive wins, including a 45-7 embarrassment of Yale in New Haven on the final game of the year. It was after this final victory that Harvard moved up to 14th in the national poll.
Like this year’s bunch, the 2011 team ranked high in several national categories. In addition to owning the country’s fifth most difficult scoring defense, Harvard’s 2011 offense averaged over 37 points per game, which put the team second in the FCS.
Statistical dominance translated to an Ivy League title. The Crimson clinched first on the second-to-last weekend of play and finished three games ahead of the nearest competition.
But with the game against Yale on Saturday, this year’s team has a chance to accomplish what the Crimson could not in 2011: go undefeated. The last time that Harvard completed a perfect season was in 2004, when the team scored 30 points in all but one game and drubbed Yale, 35-3.
This weekend, and this weekend alone, will determine whether the Crimson has enough talent, determination, and luck to match this impressive precedent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day after senior Wesley Saunders stuffed the stat sheet in a matchup against Holy Cross, the wing got word that he had been tapped for the Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 list. The award, according to its website, “is the most prestigious individual honor in college basketball.”
The news came just two weeks after ESPN deemed Saunders the 46th best player in the nation and six days after he “headline[d] the Lou Henson Award Preseason Watch List.”
Saunders was the only Ancient Eight player to be named to the Wooden Award list, and will have to best the top players in the nation if he is to earn individual honors in late March. Others nominated include prospective No. 1 2015 NBA Draft picks Jahlil Okafor and Karl-Anthony Towns, who hail from Duke and Kentucky, respectively.
Past winners of the Wooden Award include NBA phenoms Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, and Anthony Davis. Per Harvard Athletics, Saunders is just the second Harvard men’s basketball player in program history to appear on the list, joining the ranks of Jeremy Lin ’10.
On Sunday, Saunders tallied 24 points, 12 rebounds, four steals, three blocks, and three assists in a loss to Holy Cross.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the only thing separating the Harvard men’s soccer team from the NCAA Tournament was Penn. But with a 2-0 win over the Crimson in the season finale, it was the Quakers who captured the Ivy League crown as well as an automatic tournament bid.
After a year of waiting, Harvard (11-4-2, 4-1-2 Ivy) finally earned its revenge on Saturday. Behind an 89th minute goal from freshman forward Christian Sady, the Crimson picked up its first victory over Penn since 2010.
But despite closing the season with a win, Harvard found itself on the outside looking in when the 48-team tournament field was announced by the NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer Committee Monday.
After recording its best record since 2009, the Crimson held an outside chance of making the field, but according to Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer, the team had tempered its expectations.
The Crimson had entered the weekend trailing Dartmouth and Princeton by two points in the Ivy League standings, needing a win and losses from both rivals to earn an automatic bid. Otherwise, Harvard—ranked no. 55 in RPI—faced a steep hill to obtain an at-large bid.
In the end, the chips would not fall into place, as both the Big Green (11-4-2, 5-1-1) and the Tigers (11-3-3, 5-1-1) picked up wins in their final games. Meanwhile, Harvard fell to no. 59 in RPI.
By virtue of a 2-1 win over Princeton in October, Dartmouth—ranked no. 27 in RPI—received the automatic bid from the Ancient Eight. The Big Green takes on Fordham in the opening round Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Tigers join the Crimson on the outside of the field, having narrowly missed the cut. Princeton finished the season ranked no. 41 in RPI, but with several teams lower in the rankings receiving automatic bids for winning their conferences, the Tigers were out of luck.
Harvard played to a 0-1-1 record against the co-Ivy League champions.
The Crimson tied Dartmouth when the two sides clashed three weeks ago in Hanover, as senior midfielder Kyle Henderson found the back of the net on the team’s only shot of the contest.
Harvard was not as fortunate on the road against Princeton, however. Despite mounting a comeback late in the game, the Crimson could not climb out of an early three-goal hole, falling to the Tigers, 3-2.
The loss would be the only one that Harvard would endure in conference play, but it proved to make all the difference in the standings—backing up a claim made by junior defenseman Philip Fleischman back in October.
“Every game in the Ivy League is like a single elimination tournament,” Fleishman said.
Appears that way.

Leading up to last year’s Harvard-Yale football game, campus comedy group On Harvard Time surprised Yale with a wildly successful YouTube prank appropriately titled “Harvard Tours Yale.” For the video, Samuel B. Clark ’15 traveled to New Haven with OHT, posed as a Yale student, and gave tours to unwitting tourists. (Key phrase: “Gothic architecture.”) The video went viral, hitting Business Insider, the Huffington Post, and Forbes. And it was pretty damn funny.
It’ll be hard to live up to that feat, but this year, OHT is already attracting attention, even before they’ve uploaded their annual video. According to a preview they’ve posted to their YouTube channel, they traveled to New Haven again—this time, to advocate divestment from sports, according to the Yale Daily News.
And apparently, vigilante Yalies were not so unsuspecting. The YDN claims that OHT’s cover was “blown”; their student body president reportedly approached the group “on behalf of the Yale student body.” We’re not sure when Yalies became so scared of poser Harvard students, but we like it.

Undergraduate Council presidential campaign season has very much arrived, and with it comes a deluge of campaign posters and publicity stunts. Flyby picked out some of the gems—whether they’re the most ridiculous or the most predictable—and collected them for you here.
1. Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16: “Be Happy and Have Faith”
Ah, the name pun. Working names into slogans seems very middle-school-election, but we have to admit that Yang and Jackson’s names are pretty well suited to campaigning.
2. Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 and Ema H. Horvath ’16: #ThanksgivingFirst
Kanuparthy and Horvath’s campaign ads are telling Harvard to “Leave Thanksgiving alone.” Two questions: Is Thanksgiving in trouble? Are they trying to save it? We need answers.
3. Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16: “The UC begins with U”
Here, we see the classic UC and “you” pun—the two other tickets above make a similar play in their own campaign ads. This ad lacks in originality, but it does add a pretty sick design.
4. Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17: the kiddie pool photo with Steven A. Ballmer ’77
Heine and Turban round out the list with an ad that’s as bizarre as it sounds. In the ad, the pair sit partially clothed in a kiddie pool with the former Microsoft CEO standing over them. We’re not really sure what this means, but it works.

Attention: we are in the midst of the last full week of classes of this semester. No, really. I have proof. With Thanksgiving and reading period to look forward to, just one week lies between you and having Harvard’s permission to do what you have spent the semester doing anyway — not attending the entire week’s worth of classes.
This final week brings some bittersweet last opportunities, and here’s how to make the most of them.
Attend all of your classesNeed motivation? Harvard may have just installed a video camera at your specific seat to monitor how often you and you alone show up to class.
Admit that you have a crush on your TF Maybe you shouldn’t admit it to your TF, but it’s about time that you admitted it to yourself.
Go to office hoursPros: you might learn something, and you might even make new friends. Cons: you probably won’t learn anything, and you definitely won’t make any friends. Reality check: go for the recommendation letter. It will help you get a job in consulting one day.
Do your assigned readingsJust kidding. Don’t do your assigned readings. You’ve gotten this far in the semester without cracking open a single book, so why start now?
Happy class-attending, Harvard!

IN THE ATMOSPHEREToday is going to be one of the coldest we’ve had so far, with a “high” of 34 degrees and a low of 23. To add to that, it’s likely to be pretty windy and overcast for the most of the day, with a 0% chance of any precipitation. If any day’s weather screamed November, this would be it.
