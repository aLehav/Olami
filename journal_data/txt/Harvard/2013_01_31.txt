After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
February 2 through March 17
American Repertory Theater
 
Three interconnecting hexagonal shapes are taped out on the rehearsal room floor for John Tiffany’s upcoming production of Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass Menagerie,” which opens at the American Repertory Theater on Saturday. These shapes are the outlines for a pared-down version of the Wingfield apartment, where the whole action of the play will unfold. “The Glass Menagerie” follows Tom Wingfield (Zachary Quinto), a restless twenty-something who yearns to escape the claustrophobic setting of his childhood home. “It’s pure theater, what Tennessee Williams envisaged,” Tiffany says. 
 
With movement choreographed by Tiffany’s long-time collaborator Steven Hoggett and original music composed by Nico Muhly, “The Glass Menagerie” adds new artistic components to the classic play. These additions, along with the sparse set design by Tony Award-winning Bob Crowley, represent a reimagined view of the story line. Traditionally the play takes place in a claustrophobic apartment, but Crowley has chosen to remove the walls and make the set more open to the audience.
 
Although best known as a director of new works such as “Black Watch” and “Once,” which now plays on Broadway, directing the Williams classic is something Tiffany has yearned for since his student days. The play has long been one of the director’s favorites, he says.
 
When he was a Radcliffe Fellow in 2011, he met Cherry Jones, a founding member of ART and an actress best known for her role in the television series “24” and her Tony Award-winning performance in the play “Doubt.”  Tiffany recalls the lunch with Jones when he first realized she would be the perfect Amanda Wingfield, Tom’s overbearing and controlling mother in “The Glass Menagerie.”
 
“It took a while to convince her to do it,” he says. “She didn’t think it was a part that she’d ever blossom in.” But Tiffany says Jones’ reservations were quelled by the gathering of the cast 14 months ago for a read-through of the play. 
 
“Everyone came to it really hungry and excited to be in Cambridge,” Tiffany says. 
 
Despite the new design aspects of the production, Tiffany asserts that the classic text remains the focus of the piece. 
 
“I’ve been asked quite a few times, ‘Is this a radical reworking of ‘The Glass Menagerie?’’” Tiffany says. “If it is, it doesn’t feel like we’re intending to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It's pretty clear whose hip hop posse ruled 2012. In September, Kanye West released the collaborative album "Cruel Summer," which featured G.O.O.D. Music artists Big Sean, Common, and Pusha T as well as other friends like Jay-Z and 2 Chainz. G.O.O.D. Music dominated the airwaves with opulent beats and swaggering hubris. They forced us to pay attention not necessarily because the songs were groundbreaking but because the artists were elite.
The calendar has turned, and a very different crew has emerged. This group has no throne on which to sit—they rely on craft rather than spectacle. On A$AP Rocky's "1 Train," the ninth song on his new album "Long.Live.A$AP," the rising Harlem star leads a staggering showcase of seven young and hungry rappers. "I had to make the most perfect posse cut for 2013," A$AP Rocky said in a recent interview. "1 Train" might not be perfect, but it's a loud and confident fanfare for a new breed of lyricists.
The beat is supplied by Hit-Boy, a producer who crashed on the scene with West and Jay-Z's epic "Ni**as in Paris." The subdued violin riff on "1 Train" doesn't come close to matching the grandeur of "Paris," but the backbeat provides an easy groove for the rappers to ride.
A$AP's first guest is Compton wunderkind Kendrick Lamar, fresh off of his enormously successful debut album, "good kid, m.A.A.d City." Known for being socially conscious, Lamar delivers a tension-filled, psychotic narrative of a man pushed to the brink by poverty and drugs. Next up is Brooklyn kid Joey Bada$$, who continues the same themes but trades Lamar’s intensity for wordplay: "I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons / Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms / Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms."
After a suspiciously derivative Yelawolf verse, A$AP puts back to back two rappers that could represent the contrasting drugs they reference in their lines. Detroit's Danny Brown emulates the highs and lows of molly: his voice high-pitched and abrasive, he crams references to penguins, solar system planets, ostriches, and Adonis into 16 bars. Alternatively, the laid-back Queens native Action Bronson is more akin to marijuana as he alternates between introspection and silly bravado: "The moon's reflection off the lake hit me / You should have stayed with me / Now many Asian bitches lay with me."
By the time Big K.R.I.T. brings the song home with a long verse full of Southern swagger, it's hard not to imagine the kind of impact this posse will have in the coming years. Four of these seven released their major-label debuts last year, with two more scheduled to debut in 2013. Long gone are the days of East Coast-West Coast beefing; now, all the most talented young rappers from around the country hang out with, record with, and tweet at each other. The camaraderie may make for less drama, but it’s hard to argue with the cohesion and potential shown in "1 Train."

As of Monday evening, the Cambridge City Council continues to engage in a crucial debate regarding a proposal to limit the size of sodas in the city. The policy in question has much in common with that of New York City’s Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s, which caps the size of sugary drinks to 16 ounces at movie theaters, restaurants, and mobile food carts. The Cambridge City Council is aware of the rather significant health benefits of such a ban as well as the supposed infringement on individual liberties. The Harvard Crimson Staff encourages the City Council to support the soda size limit because it is a sensible public health policy that addresses the serious problem of obesity while curbing the ability of corporations to market extremely unhealthy goods at extremely low prices.
It is widely acknowledged that the U.S. is one of the “heaviest” countries in the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Furthermore, some of the leading causes of preventable death, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer, stem from obesity. A single 20-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola contains 65 grams of sugar—nearly twice as much as the daily recommended value for men by the American Heart Association. When it is so clear that there is an evident health risk that can be ameliorated by implementing a smaller container for sugary beverages, public health officials have a responsibility to the American public to do so. The question arises, however, as to whether they do in fact have the authority to make such a decision on behalf of citizens.
Does the government have the authority to assign a standard number of seconds on crosswalk signals before individuals can walk? Does it have the authority to limit the amount of trans fat served in individual dishes at public restaurants? Or in Cambridge, is it justifiable that liquor stores cannot sell alcohol after 11 p.m.? Although these examples could all be considered limitations on individual autonomy, they highlight an overarching value system that prioritizes health and human life over the free market.
Moreover and most crucially, it is a myth that consumer choice drives demand for harmful, heavily processed products; rather, predatory marketing, misguided agricultural policy, and a number of other factors jointly conspire to determine the foods that Americans eat. Government policy does not limit individual freedom any more than the free market already does, and it is the duty of local government to begin to shift the public climate and expose those parties who are responsible for America’s public health crisis. A large soda ban would not threaten individual liberties, but it would go a long way to limit corporate power.
Although large soda bans are routinely mocked in popular culture, it is vitally important that we tackle an obesity epidemic that costs our nation billions of dollars each year. Policy reform at the local level is an important first step in doing so. We hope that the Cambridge City Council approves this proposal and paves the way for many more localities to follow suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over winter break, I was arrested with seven other students for staging a lock-in at the Westborough, Mass. office of the TransCanada Corporation in protest of the Keystone XL pipeline. Bound together with chains, sitting beneath the corporation’s logo and the American flag, we made the point that TransCanada is locking our generation into irreversible climate disaster by pushing forward new fossil fuel infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline.
Growing up, I never expected to be arrested for civil disobedience, but today I find myself and my generation in a desperate situation. We are living in a time of great crisis—the climate crisis. The World Bank recently published a report announcing that we are on track to warm the planet up by four degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The report details predictions of intense heat waves, widespread water shortages, massive wildfires, and the disruption of livelihoods around the world. These alarming details, however, are overshadowed by the authors’ terrifying statement that “there is no certainty that adaptation to a 4°C world would be possible.”
We may not be able to adapt to global warming. The basis of our civilization could fall out from under our feet within our lifetimes. Everything we have ever worked for—all the cities, the families, the art, the science—could be lost.
Unfortunately, the unbendable rules of chemistry and physics have set a very narrow timeframe for action against the climate crisis. After humans have warmed the planet up a certain amount, we will cross a natural “tipping point,” such as the melting of the arctic tundra and the accompanying release of potent greenhouse gases locked under its surface. After these tipping points, the Earth will begin to warm itself, and any success we have in lowering our own greenhouse gas emissions will not stop the warming. No one knows exactly when the tipping points will arrive, but the International Energy Agency has projected that we will be “locked in” to irreversible climate change in four years because of our continued construction of fossil fuel infrastructure.
Rage boils up inside of me when I look at these numbers because the world did not need to let things go this close to the edge. Scientists have been calling for action for more years than I have been alive, yet our government has failed to act. The costs of inaction grow each day, as the timeframe left to transition to renewables shortens and the impacts of climate change, from last summer’s droughts in the Midwest to Superstorm Sandy, start to take their toll. Even today, our government has failed to act with enough resolve to really solve the problem. Its failure is inexcusable.
If our government will not stop these corporations on the basis of strong scientific and economic arguments, then we must produce the political will to stop them through our actions. The traditional methods of political mobilization—rallies, lobbying, even opinion polls that show 88 percent support for government action on climate change—have failed to overcome the stranglehold that fossil fuel corporations have on our government. Civil disobedience has thus become a logical and necessary next step for the increasingly powerful and desperate climate movement.
Our action in Westborough was not an anomaly but rather an addition to a growing nationwide narrative as more and more people turn to civil disobedience to stop the climate crisis. Over 1,200 activists were arrested for a sit-in against Keystone XL outside the White House, while dozens of Texan activists have taken courageous direct action to prevent and delay construction of the pipeline’s southern leg. Coal mines, natural gas fracking wells, and other fossil fuel infrastructure projects are becoming hotbeds for civil disobedience, as are the offices of the decision-makers who irresponsibly let the projects proceed. In a sign of the times, the Sierra Club recently made the first exception in 120 years to its policy against civil disobedience.
By putting our bodies on the line in acts of peaceful civil disobedience, we are making the ultimate moral statement. The message sent by our sacrifices will reverberate through society until the corporations give up or the government finally finds the political will to stop them.
The task of transitioning to renewable energy may look daunting, but as our acts of civil disobedience make clear, our commitment to survival is non-negotiable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the coming days, hundreds of Harvardians will “rush” one or more of the six Greek letter organizations already present on this campus. Additionally and for the first time in a decade, some of our peers will soon comprise the founding class of a Greek colony at Harvard, namely that of the Alpha Phi women’s fraternity. Although Harvard’s Greek scene is currently less prominent than those found at many of our peer institutions, the introduction of a fourth national women’s Greek organization to the College attests to the pronouncedly increased interest in Greek life seen lately at this institution. Despite this phenomenon, the Office of Student Life denies fraternities and sororities admission to the ranks of recognized student organizations and is thereby doing a disservice to both this community and to itself.
Barring a propitious about-face, incoming Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde and his colleagues will almost certainly continue to refuse to recognize Harvard’s burgeoning Greek community for the foreseeable future. I presume that the rationale for doing so will be essentially tripartite; specifically, administrators will probably resist such recognition on the grounds that Greek life is regrettably sexist, ultimately nefarious, and fundamentally detrimental to so-called “House life.” None of these accusations is tenable, and the College would ultimately benefit from changing its position on this issue.
Fraternities and sororities are, by definition, sexist; so is the Radcliffe Choral Society. Just as a women’s chorus can sound uniquely harmonious, so too can social organizations derive particular benefits from the exclusion of one sex. Rare is the one who would argue that a “girl’s night out” is a damaging pursuit, but many are of the mind that recognizing Greeks would make for a more misogynistic Harvard. This is a remarkably bizarre assertion, as sororities will soon outnumber fraternities on this campus; they already count three times as many sisters as our fraternities do brothers. I have heard many Harvard women speak glowingly of their sorority experiences and have yet to hear one remark about any misogyny on the part of a Harvard fraternity. If Greek life at Harvard is lamentably sexist in any way, then the evidence of this has been hidden remarkably well.
Greek letter organizations are plagued by a host of negative connotations, many of which are understandable in light of tragedies and scandals both past and present. That said, I know not of any deplorable acts committed in recent memory by any fraternity or sorority at Harvard. In my experience, Crimson Greeks, particularly those who hold office in their respective organizations, are among the most involved and conscientious persons on this campus. It is unreasonable to presume that Greeks will be Greeks, if you will, especially in light of their well-established and admirable track record on this campus.
To suggest that Greeks ought not to be recognized out of concerns that doing so would detract from or preclude the experience of living in one’s House presumes that the College’s residential system is actually effective in every case. It is not. While few students actually live off campus, many are far from floored about their “House community” and are eager for a more vibrant social life at Harvard (one need look no further than the many calls for new social spaces on campus to verify this assertion). The sisters and brothers whom I know find that their Greek involvement does not diminish but rather augments their enjoyment of their House, and a number of House Committee members are also Greeks. Our administrators’ long-held belief—dare I say, pipe dream—that the Houses somehow contain the solutions to all social problems at Harvard is both perplexing and deleterious, and there is no reason to believe that recognizing Greek life would set the Houses back in any way.
The Greek presence on this campus will inevitably continue to surge regardless of whether it is sanctioned any time soon. It is clear that fraternities and sororities confer benefits that many Harvardians desire, and when Harvard students know what they want, they will find it (or create it if they must). It would behoove our administration to recognize fraternities and sororities on this campus so that it might assist in ensuring that Greek life at Harvard benefits our community as much as it can.

“How do you like the bounty hunting business?”
“Kill white people and get paid for it? What’s not to like?”
I burst out laughing, and I could hear others around me giggling too. As a film fanatic, I had dragged my friend to a screening of the new Tarantino film “Django Unchained” on the day it opened in my city. An hour in, I was laughing inconsolably at the barrage of cleverly written dry witticisms of Christoph Waltz and deadpan one-liners of Jamie Foxx. At a certain point, members of the audience cheered and clapped when Django, a newly freed slave, mercilessly whipped a cruel slave overseer to an inch of his life before planting a bullet in his head. It seemed that yet another one of Tarantino’s violently comical motion pictures had succeeded in satisfying an audience.
But the energy quickly vanished from the cinema as the film took a much darker turn. A runaway slave getting ripped apart alive by hunting dogs, a “Mandingo fighter” punching the teeth out of another before pummeling him to death, a woman’s face being branded. I could not bring myself to watch, and I could tell that everyone else was horrified yet mesmerized by the brutality on screen. But soon the audience’s attention was turned away from the film and toward a pair of young men behind me, who were laughing sadistically, maniacally, and uncontrollably during these horrific scenes.
I was in a complete state of shock. My friend and I looked at each other in confusion. Who could find such a vivid account of the very real, appalling treatment of human beings during a dark chapter in America’s history so funny? An uncomfortable tension filled the cinema. The laughing went on for the next hour in the otherwise dead silence.
Finally, someone spoke.
“You’re laughing a little too loud.”
The laughing stopped.
As I left the theatre, I could not help but feel overwhelming feelings of guilt. Yes, those men sitting behind me had a perverse sense of humor, but how was I any different? I walked into the theatre fully aware of the horrors of slavery. I had just finished two chapters on slavery in “A People’s History of the United States” by Howard Zinn. The film even opened with five miserable slaves shackled together, forced to walk through the cold barefoot. Yet I still laughed at the film’s jokes using the “n” word and a hilarious scene involving white supremacists. Am I just as ignorant as those two men because I treated such a serious subject so lightly? Am I guilty of being a sheltered armchair historian who whitewashes the abominable truth? And, out of all people, did it really have to take Quentin Tarantino himself to make me realize how little I appreciate the realities behind words I had skimmed over in a book?
Regardless of whether you equate me with the men who sat behind me, one thing is certain. The lines between history and fiction often blur as time goes by. We must watch historical films, whether humorous or not, with the ability to appreciate the entertainment provided by expert filmmaking while simultaneously respecting the truth. That is the power of films like “Django Unchained.” These films remind us of the horrors that we, as 21st century upstarts who stand on the shoulders of the giants of history, often fail to appreciate. I was more emotionally affected by the depiction of slaves being whipped in “Django Unchained” than by the countless readings on the treatment of slaves for the British Empire class I took last semester.
That was my “Django Moment”: the point I realized that I should never have to rely on a film to alert me of my false way of studying history and observing current events. “Django” brilliantly politicizes Tarantino’s usual comic violence. It hits closer to the bone because, unlike in his other films, the recipients of violence are not comical villains or unsympathetic heroes. Rather, they are slaves. They are people who actually suffered in the way that is portrayed on screen. But it should not have to take a Tarantino film to serve as a wake-up call. Next time you skim a news item or a reading for class, take a moment to appreciate the knowledge you have gained rather than just quickly absorbing it so you can whip out some brilliant anecdote during section.
Next time I have a moment of self-realization, I hope I won’t be covering my eyes while listening to the sounds of hunting dogs and depraved laughter. And I hope your “Django Moment” will be a little less graphic too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has long been an underdog in competitive chess. More than a decade has passed since the Harvard Chess Club sent a team in contention for the Pan-American Intercollegiate Chess Championship title.
But at last year’s Ivy League Chess Championship, Harvard did not even reach the podium; Columbia took first-place, Dartmouth finished second, and Yale and Princeton tied for third.
Now, after a rewarding draw with Yale at the schools’ annual competition last fall, the team is preparing for a comeback at the 2013 Ivy League Chess Championship on Feb. 22, according to co-president Tony A. Blum ’14.
Regardless of the outcome, the leaders of Harvard Chess are pushing to intensify the team’s tournament training in hopes of becoming more competitive nationally in the long run.
STEEP COMPETITION
Harvard Chess last grabbed headlines in 2002, when it placed fourth at the Pan-American competition and gave chess giants University of Texas at Dallas and University of Maryland, Baltimore County a run for their money.
While Harvard is now at the top of the Ivy League, on the national scene, the team faces steep competition from schools which recruit internationally.
Currently, the Harvard chess club includes one master and five experts, expert, a rank one knotch before Master
At University of Maryland, Baltmore, which offers full-scholarships to strong chess players, the chess team consists of two grand masters, two international masters, one women’s international grand master, and one master.
“[Our success] basically boils down to the fact that we’ve invested so much money and resources to get top players from around the world,” said Richard Selzler, vice president of the UMBC Chess. “Our top players come from Georgia, Israel, [and] Russia.”
Though Harvard Chess used to hold try outs to limit its membership, the team is now open to the Harvard and Cambridge communities, regardless of their experience.
As part of the initiative to increase the team’s competitiveness on the national stage, the chess club co-presidents and vice-president hope to revamp practice to include more formalized training.
WORK VERSUS PLAY
On Wednesday nights, club members camp out in the back of Quincy Dining Hall, lining a few tables with chess mats and clocks for timing.
For the first 30 minutes, the area is quiet as players practice tournament-style play.
Players stare intently at their boards, calculating all possible permutations, debating the pros and cons of each position before finally moving a piece and hitting the clock.
But after a few rounds, a table of laughter and shouting emerges, a table where weary players congregate after finishing a grueling match.
This is the bughouse table.
In bughouse, chess becomes a team sport—two boards, two players per team, and 2 one-on-one matches.
Players sit adjacent to their partners, one manipulating white pieces and the other black; each player then adds to his board the pieces his partner has captured.
Bughouse players have only three minutes to make all their moves. Time runs too short for careful calculation, and players make moves off instinct.
When Malcolm D. Grayson ’15 makes his way toward the table, a couple of the players holler, “I thought you were quitting bughouse.”
Grayson told himself that he was going to work on tournament-style play, but he cannot resist.
“It’s addictive,” says Faculty Advisor Joseph K. Blitzstein.
Jake S. Miller ’15, vice-president of the Harvard Chess Club, said that currently, practices are “casual.” He added that, “ultimately, we want people not only to be playing and enjoying it but also to be getting better.”
According to Miller, he and the co-presidents want club meetings to remain a welcoming place for those who play recreationally, while offering instruction to those preparing for competitive play.
INVESTING IN THE FUTURE
Co-president Benjamin M. Ascherman ’14 noted that chess requires practice and dedication to improve.
“Unlike most board games, there’s some luck but it’s mainly talent—you’re not rolling any dice,” Ascherman said.
Members of the team hope to secure funding to supplement current training with chess books and formalized coaching.
They also hope to invest in a new computer engine that can analyze games.
According to Miller, the team has thought about asking Marc R. Esserman ’05, an international master ranked 40th among active chess players in the nation by the United States Chess Federation, to coach the team.
In his freshman year at the college, Esserman helped Harvard Chess place fourth at the Pan-American tournament.
Given the number of schools that recruit for chess, finishing in the top five at the Pan-American tournament would be beyond the reach of Harvard Chess for the foreseeable future, according to Blum.
But Blum called Harvard “one of the more competitive Ivies” and said that the team had a reasonable chance of winning the Ivy Championship in February.
“The team is moving from being based on casual enjoyment of the game to being a serious competitor on the national scene,” Miller said.
“The most enjoyment can come from playing against other schools, and we’re trying to make a transition towards that.”

Though scaffolding and black tarp continue to shroud the facade of Old Quincy, renovations on the building are proceeding according to plan.
“At the end of December, the Old Quincy Test Project approached 50 percent completion and continues to track on schedule and budget,” Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an email statement.
Although the Neo-Georgian exterior remains intact, the inside of Old Quincy has been gutted and the entire layout has been remodeled.
“Interior wall framing and the rough-in installation of the electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems has been completed in the upper floors of the building and is progressing down through the lower levels,” Neal wrote.
According to Neal, structural modifications to the lower level are expected to be finished by the end of January.
Neal wrote that administrators view the renovations of Quincy House a “test project” because it will provide key information that may influence the renewal process for the rest of the Houses.
Construction on Old Leverett is slated to begin in June of 2013, followed by Dunster in the summer of 2014.
A sign posted outside of Quincy’s main entrance provides students with a weekly update about the progress of construction.
Students displaced by the renovations on Old Quincy are currently being housed in three Harvard-owned apartment buildings across the Square. Despite the relocations, many students said that construction has not posed a significant disruption to student life.
Daniel Sung ’15, a Quincy resident currently living in Hampden Hall on Plympton St., said he feels that swing housing is “amazing.”
“We get the best,” Sung said, referring to the fact that next year, sophomores will occupy the renovated Old Quincy complete with updated living accomodations.
Alexis J. Smith ’15, who is also living in swing housing, echoed Sung’s sentiment.
“I’m not really exposed to a lot of the noise or construction,” Smith said. “I don’t have any negative feelings about it.”
Smith said she appreciates the efforts of the University to revamp the Houses.
“It shows the housing system moving in a modern direction,” she said.

Harvard Law School’s first ever online course launched Monday, opening up “Copyright,” a class taught by Law School professor William W. Fisher, III, to hundreds of people worldwide.
HLS1x: “Copyright,” which is offered through the Harvard branch of the online learning platform edX, is closely modeled after the Law School course taught by Fisher since 1994.
According to Fisher, 4,100 people applied to take “Copyright,” which is the first and only edX class to have a fixed enrollment. Fisher and his teaching fellows selected 500 students for the 12-week course.
When choosing students, Fisher said, he looked for candidates with ”a certain minimum level of English competence and intelligence.”
“Past that, the process was not like the admissions at a place like Harvard,” Fisher said.
“We were looking for commitment, people who would be engaged and follow through, and diversity in many dimensions, including profession, age, field and geography. We got it,” he added.
Enrollees range in occupation from high school students to professional lawyers.
Fisher said that many of the enrolled students have no formal legal background but work in fields such as music or journalism that touch upon copyright issues
For the online course, Fisher will post 12 pre-recorded lectures, which he described as “not dumbed down at all” from those he gives at the Law School.
In live seminars conducted by video chat, 25 students will discuss the material with a teaching fellow who either has already taken or is currently enrolled in the in-person version of the course taught at Harvard.
Fisher is also hosting six webcast events with outside speakers.
Half of the students enrolled in “Copyright” will study case-law drawn primarily from the United States and the other half will take a global curriculum that uses sources from around the world.
Fisher said he thinks that copyright law, which he views as economically and socially significant, particularly suits the format of an online course “because of its readily grasped cultural importance.”
If this course runs effectively, Fisher said that he expects Harvard to offer more law courses through edX in the future.
Several professors at the Law School have already approached him about starting their own online courses sometime next year, he said.
“My hope is in this course to test and refine some constructive types of information technology and try to avoid malign deployments of information technology in teaching,” Fisher said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 on Wednesday named William “Mo” Cowan, his former chief of staff and trusted aide, to serve as interim U.S. Senator for the next five months.
Cowan will occupy the Senate seat resigned Tuesday by newly confirmed Secretary of State John F. Kerry until the seat is filled in a special election on June 25.
Cowan, 43, was a partner at a Boston law firm and a former special prosecutor for the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office when he was recruited by Patrick to join the gubernatorial administration in 2009.
After spending two years as the governor’s chief legal counsel, Cowan became Patrick’s chief of staff in January 2011, serving for another two years before departing last month.
“Mo is a highly respected public citizen,” Patrick told reporters at a Wednesday press conference announcing the selection. “The people of the Commonwealth have benefitted from his wisdom and good judgment during his time in our office and will again in the Senate.”
The search for a replacement for Kerry, who had served in the Senate since 1985, began almost immediately after last November’s election. Kerry, who had travelled abroad for the Obama administration in a diplomatic capacity and had grown close to the president while playing the role of Mitt Romney in debate preparation, emerged as a contender for Secretary of State almost immediately.
He was nominated in December and approved by the same leading Republicans who killed the candidacy of Susan E. Rice, ambassador to the United Nations. Rice had been the frontrunner for the post until she was derailed by criticism of her comments about the September 2012 attack on the U.S. embassy in  Bengazi, Libya.
Since then, the hunt for a replacement in Massachusetts intensified, and so did the competition.
The recently retired Barnett “Barney” Frank ’61-’62 publicly petitioned Patrick to consider him for the temporary seat, and the governor himself acknowledged that he received more than a few phone calls from interested parties. Some observers even called for Patrick to appoint himself.
Cowan did not emerge as a leading candidate in the public eye until late in the game. Frank succeeded in generating early media attention with his public appeal, and many believed that Victoria R. Kennedy, the wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, was a frontrunner.
Throughout the entire process, Patrick and his search committee remained tight-lipped.
The night before the appointment, media outlets named Cowan and Kennedy as likely frontrunners, but even those who dared to make a prediction quickly acknowledged that Patrick could pull a name out of left field.
It was not until just before Patrick’s scheduled press conference Wednesday that the selection was finally leaked in a report by the Boston Globe.
Cowan, who will travel to Washington, D.C., by early next week, said he does not intend to use his five months on Capitol Hill as a springboard for future political ambitions.
“This is going to be a very short political career,” he said. “I am not running for office, and I am not a candidate for public service anytime, today or in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As former President of Mexico Felipe Calderón arrives in Cambridge this week to begin a fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School, human rights activists and the School’s officials continue to engage in a back-and-forth over his appointment.
Protesters argue that Calderón’s initiation of the drug wars in Mexico, which have resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, should disqualify him from the fellowship.
A petition circulated on change.org by former U.S. border control officer John Randolph, protesting Calderón’s fellowship has accumulated over 35,000 signatures since the appointment was announced in late November.
The petition’s authors delivered the petition to Kennedy School associate dean for communications and public affairs Melodie L. Jackson to discuss their grievances, according to a Kennedy School press release.
Randolph wrote in an email to The Crimson that he has told the petition’s supporters that he would present the appeal to Harvard again if it receives its goal of 100,000 signatures.
Debate has also swelled in the Mexican intellectual community. El Colegio de México Professor Sergio Aguayo and poet Javier Sicilia appealed to Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, requesting a written explanation for Calderón’s appointment.
“The unique opportunity to engage in direct discussion with a former head of state is one that many of our students value greatly, even if they may disagree with some of that leader’s policy positions,” Ellwood responded publicly.
Thus far, Kennedy School statements have not addressed the drug wars specifically, but have defended the decision to name Calderón the inaugural Angelopoulos Fellow.
“I am confident that Mr. Calderón’s one-year fellowship will create numerous opportunities for rigorous discussion and debate on a range of important issues between our students and Mexico’s former president,” Ellwood said in a statement.
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky said that although he does not defend Calderón’s drug wars, “I just don’t think he’s a criminal.”
“We should want to bring in people who generate criticism and debate. We should want to bring in people we disagree with—even vehemently so. That’s how we learn,” Levitsky said.
Institutionally, Harvard has remained behind Calderón and there has been little public objection among students.
One distinguished Harvard graduate has expressed disapproval, however.
“I believe that the presence of Calderón at Harvard contradicts the values of representative democracy, critical thinking and intellectual and personal honesty the University promotes,” Mexican diplomat Hector Vasconcelos ’68 told Mexican news site Sin Embargo. Vasconcelos warned that he would return his Harvard degree should the Kennedy School uphold Calderón’s fellowship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who enroll in most Harvard courses this spring will turn in assignments that will be viewed by just one or two instructors. But the students who take Chinese History 185 will produce work that will be used by thousands of online learners across the globe.
Chinese History 185: “Creating ChinaX—Teaching China’s History Online” is a new Harvard class devoted to developing modules for ChinaX, an online class to be offered next fall through edX, the free not-for-profit online learning venture started by Harvard and MIT last May. ChinaX—which will be offered online through HarvardX, Harvard’s subset of the larger initiative—will delve into Chinese history and culture stretching from the 6th to the 18th century.
On Wednesday, roughly 30 shoppers filed into a mortar-and-bricks Harvard classroom for the first Chinese History 185 class of the semester. Speaking to his prospective students, course head Peter K. Bol advertised the first-of-its-kind Harvard course as an opportunity for the students to creatively collaborate.
“Together, you possess more knowledge than any of you do alone,” Bol, a professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, told the crowd of College students, graduate students, and visiting scholars in the room.
For the next month, the students who enroll in Chinese History 185 will study an overview of China’s history through a curriculum that is a condensed version of Societies of the World 12: “China: Traditions and Transformations,” another course taught by Bol.
Students will then choose module topics and then work in teams to design maps and illustrations, assemble videos, select text and images for online discussion, and produce content structures.
During class, students will assess each other’s modules and evaluate effective online teaching techniques. They will also attend lab once a week to learn how to edit video and create virtual illustrations.
Ren Wei, a teaching fellow for the course, asked shoppers on Wednesday to consider the benefits and limitations of examining artwork on a computer screen, rather than in a traditional museum.
By way of example, Wei said that while computers allow students to view inscriptions on an artistic chest in high definition, they restrict that persective to two dimensions.
Kristen T. Faulkner ’15, who shopped Chinese History 185 on Wednesday, said she is looking forward to taking the class because she feels it meshes well with her existing academic interests.
“I am in my third year of Chinese and a computer science concentrator, so I’m really excited about the technology side—and it deals with education too,” Faulkner said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1992, his penultimate year as Cincinnati’s football coach, current Harvard coach Tim Murphy led his Bearcats to a 3-8 finish. More than 20 years later, a trio of assistant coaches from that team is preparing to man the sidelines at Super Bowl XLVII, but at the time, Cincy assistants John Harbaugh, Jerry Rosburg, and Craig Ver Steeg hardly looked like hot coaching commodities.
Harbaugh had just finished leading a special teams unit that finished 102nd out of 107 Division I teams in net punting. In his fifth year in the position, it seemed that Harbaugh’s football ascendancy had stalled for good after 10 years of coaching.
Rosburg, who helped Harbaugh with special teams and guided a linebacker unit that was part of the 62nd-best total defense, was in a similar position. Ver Steeg coached the quarterbacks and wide receivers to the 62nd-ranked passing attack and admits that his career prospects seemed bleak before coming to the Bearcats.
“I was looking for my first real opportunity back then,” Ver Steeg said. “I had been hanging on in college football. I was doing things like grad assistant, part-time guy, recruiting coordinator.… It’s hard, getting that first real shot to be a full-time coach.”
The story of how they went from a mediocre mid-major conference college program to the biggest stage in American sports is a parable about the determination and lucky breaks necessary to make it in the football coaching world.
Harbaugh grew up the son of a football coach and, after playing defensive back at Miami (Ohio), started a football coaching career of his own. While his background is fairly standard for the industry, his career path to the Ravens was anything but typical.
The coach got his start as a graduate assistant at Western Michigan and spent a year each at Pittsburgh and Morehead State. When Murphy left the University of Maine to take over in Cincinnati before the 1989 season, he asked Harbaugh to move once more.
Over three years, Harbaugh had three jobs, moving up in responsibility each time. But he stayed with the Bearcats after the 1989 season; then 1990 came and went without a better job offer. Pretty soon it was 1993 Cincinnati’s 3-8 season, and he remained in the same position. Coach Harbaugh had spent five seasons in the Queen City with little to show for it.
Harbaugh was frustrated and anxious that his rise might have reached its final destination. But looking back, the coach is thankful for his time under Murphy.
“There never has been a guy that I’ve been around who works harder, that is more detailed and covers every base,” Harbaugh said. “I think that was one of the biggest things that you learned as a young coach from ‘Murph’—that you were going to have to have all t’s crossed and the i’s dotted. As a young coach, that’s a great lesson to have. Plus, he was just an incredible friend, a guy who cares about players and cares about coaches. That’s important.”
Murphy’s wisdom might have been valuable, but ultimately it was his departure that sparked the renaissance of Harbaugh’s career. Due in part to the vacancies left when Murphy went to Harvard, Harbaugh was promoted to assistant head coach.
After two years as assistant head coach, Harbaugh got a job at Indiana University in the Big Ten, one of college football’s premier conferences. It took just one season there to catch the eye of the NFL’s Philadelphia Eagles, who hired Harbaugh to be their special teams coordinator.
The NFL coaching structure takes a completely different shape from its college counterpart. With fewer jobs and a plethora of quality candidates, keeping your job becomes the priority, with promotions coming as bonuses. For nine years, Harbaugh coached special teams in Philadelphia. In 2007, he moved within the organization to take charge of the secondary unit.
A year later, Harbaugh got an interview with the Ravens as they searched for a new head coach following the firing of Brian Billick. Baltimore decided to give him the head gig.
“I can’t tell you I thought he’d be an NFL head coach, but I’ll tell you one thing, he was a tremendous coach,” Murphy said. “He was a tremendously charismatic, impressive coach from the standpoint of his work ethic, his attention to detail, and ultimately what he got out of his players.”
After settling into his new position, Harbaugh began putting together his staff. When looking for someone to fill the role Harbaugh himself made his living for a number of years, the young head coach turned to Rosburg, his former Cincinnati colleague.
Up to that point, Rosburg had following a career path remarkably similar to Harbaugh’s. The former college linebacker left the Bearcats after the 1995 season and bounced around the college ranks before being hired by the Cleveland Browns to run their special teams, which he did for six seasons until Harbaugh brought him onto the Baltimore staff.
Ver Steeg’s resume shows a different growth path. While Harbaugh and Rosburg stayed in Cincinnati when Murphy took the Harvard job, Ver Steeg followed the man that gave him his first big shot.
“The fact of the matter was that there weren’t as many spots on his new staff as there were on his old staff,” Ver Steeg said. “I was thankful for the chance to continue with him.”
Ver Steeg did not just get job security when Murphy brought him to Harvard; he also got a promotion, as Murphy gave him more responsibility in the passing game.
“It was my first opportunity to put something together and start learning to be a coordinator,” Ver Steeg said. “That helped me for when I became a coordinator later on for sure.”
To this day, Ver Steeg thanks Murphy for what he did for his coaching career.
“I appreciated the chance that he gave more than anything,” Ver Steeg said. “I always appreciated the fact that here I was, a young guy that hadn’t really proven himself at all yet, getting close to 30, and he basically took a chance on me. I’ll never forget that…. I’ll always be in his debt.”
Ver Steeg spent two years in Cambridge before taking a limited role with the NFL’s Chicago Bears before the 1996 season.
From there, he dropped back to the college game, serving as quarterbacks coach at Illinois and offensive coordinator at Utah and Rutgers before reuniting with Harbaugh in Baltimore.
Now that Harbaugh has experience in the art of hiring a coaching staff, he respects the job Murphy did in the early 1990’s.
“The amazing thing about that whole deal was the staff that ‘Murph’ put together,” Harbaugh said. “He did great things in assembling and mentoring his staff…. ‘Murph’ was a young coach, and he didn’t know a lot of coaches, but he was a great interviewer of prospective coaches. He’d sit you down and you’d do a full-day interview. At the end of the day, he knew if you were his kind of guy or not.”
While the results of Murphy’s work might not have been clear during the 1993 season, they are evident with the benefit of hindsight. Murphy’s former assistants on the Ravens staff are just three of many members of Murphy’s coaching tree that now litter NFL staffs, including Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan. And on Sunday, his one-time employees will take their shot at the sport’s biggest prize.

CORRECTION: Feb. 3, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the year in which current Harvard football coach Tim Murphy coached his penultimate season at the University of Cincinnati. In fact, it was 1992, not 1993.
