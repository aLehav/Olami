After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Urban Outfitters and Sweet Bakery in Harvard Square closed their doors earlier this month ahead of planned renovations to the Brattle Street building that housed them.
Construction, plans for which have been in the works for years, is set to begin this spring and has affected businesses in buildings owned by the commercial real estate firm Regency Centers, according to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
“The closing of Sweet is not a surprise. Their closing along with Urban Outfitters, Vision House and Tealuxe were expected,” Jillson wrote in an email.
Sweet Bakery owner Katia Pekar said that though the timeline for the renovations is not yet finalized, she is exploring the possibility of partnering with another local shop to fulfill pickup orders and obtain shelf space. Whether Sweet will be able to return to the location once construction is completed, however, is not yet certain.
“They’re going to determine if they’re going to, you know, make it offices or if they’re going to bring new businesses in or are they going to offer old businesses to come back,” Pekar said.
Sam Stiebel, Regency Centers’ Vice President of Investments in the Boston area, declined to comment on the futures of most current tenants of the renovated buildings. He did reiterate that the Curious George Store would be returning after construction, a decision made last year after community outcry.
“We like to remain fairly private about leasing discussions that we’ve had with our store owners,” he wrote in an email.
Pekar said she would like to see Sweet return to the Square soon.
“We will be looking for a new location hopefully and in the near future we’ll be back soon,” Pekar said.
Representatives for Urban Outfitters did not respond to a request for comment.
The two closings come after several long-time Harvard Square businesses recently shut down, including Crema Cafe, Chipotle, and Tealuxe. Tealuxe was also located in the building undergoing construction.
Jillson said she expects the construction project to disrupt traffic and pedestrian areas. Upon completion of the project, however, she said she anticipates the renovations will “result in positive changes for the Square.”
“While businesses closing or moving creates challenges, we look forward to the newly renovated Abbot and 18 Brattle Street buildings,” Jillson wrote.
Stiebel wrote that Regency is looking to extend the life of the buildings that have sat in the Square for more than a century.
“The buildings were over 100 years old and have a lot of differed maintenance due and repairs required, and we’re trying to restore them to modern standards so they can last for another 100 years,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
State officials at the Massachusetts Department of Transportation announced final plans for rebuilding a large stretch of the Massachusetts Turnpike in Allston Thursday, ending years of debate.
The $1.1 billion project will lower the Mass. Turnpike to ground level in Allston and elevate Soldiers Field Road along the Charles River onto a new viaduct above the highway.
The crumbling Allston viaduct — an elevated highway built in the 1960s — currently costs $800,000 annually to maintain, according to MassDOT.
The new project, which may not begin for a few years and may take up to eight years to complete, will radically change the western front of the city and affect travel in Allston for years to come.
Government officials and residents approved of the final plan despite the potential travel disruptions caused by the construction, .
“This option keeps infrastructure out of the Charles River and away from its banks, creating more parkland while simultaneously creating enough room to separate pedestrians and cyclists on the Paul Dudley White Path,” MassDOT Secretary and CEO Stephanie Pollack wrote in a press release announcing the plan selection.
“It meets the needs of the drivers of the cars and trucks using Soldiers Field Road and I-90, providing shoulders that ensure safe and effective highway operations,” she wrote.
Pollack acknowledged that the construction is expected to cause traffic issues in Allston, but stood by the final decision.
“I select the Hybrid despite the fact that it requires a long and complicated construction period that will disrupt travelers whether they are in cars or trucks, on commuter rail, or walking or cycling on the Paul Dudley White Path,” she wrote.
Allston resident Christopher J. Arena said he is relatively pleased with MassDOT’s decision.
“I’m actually quite grateful that Secretary Pollack wrote such a fantastic letter herself, analyzing the proposal,” he said. “It was a really great analysis of the pros and cons, so I’m actually really quite grateful at how thoughtful she was in that. I think it’s a pretty big policy win.”
Though Arena said he is satisfied with the proposal overall, he pointed to West Station — a transit station slated to be constructed on Harvard-owned land in Allston as part of the project — as an element of the plan that needs more attention. He said the construction of such a station could alleviate anticipated traffic during construction.
“I think there needs to be a hard commitment to expanding the commuter rail or extending the T or finding ways to address some of the issues with Mass. transit that isn’t car,” Arena said. “I’m of the belief that Boston has to be multimodal.”
“I want to make sure that not only with this development, but future developments, that we make sure we think for a future Boston that’s not so car-dependent,” he added.
Harvard has promised to dedicate $58 million to the construction of West Station, including $8 million for an interim station that could be built by the mid-2020s.
“The University is pleased to see forward-moving progress by MassDOT with the selection of a preferred alternative for the ‘throat section’ design of the Allston Multimodal project,” Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement.
“Harvard will continue to work closely with the Baker Administration, the City of Boston and the many stakeholders engaged through participation in the I-90 Task Force process on important decisions that remain,” she added.
Pollack wrote in the press release that a timeline for the station “will depend on service and scheduling decisions that will be made by the MBTA.”
