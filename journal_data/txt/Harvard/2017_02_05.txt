After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twelve students were elected to the Undergraduate Council Friday after a two-day voting period for the Council’s midterm election.
A total of 402 undergraduates cast ballots this election, according to UC Election Commission chair Matthew C. Estes ’18. Earlier this week, 27 undergraduates declared their candidacy—a decline from the 35 who ran in the 2016 midterm election. In last year’s election, 447 students voted for ten open seats.
No students voted in Quincy House, a race where Garrett Wen ’18 ran unopposed. In the other uncontested race, 12 students voted in Lowell House to re-elect representatives Berkeley Brown ’18 and Samarth Gupta ’18; Tom Brady, a quarterback for the New England Patriots, received three first-preference votes.
Consistent with many UC elections, the election saw low voter turnout across the eight upperclassman Houses and the freshman Elm Yard. In the UC’s last two presidential elections, for example, less than half of the College’s student body cast ballots.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 said she hoped to rectify the low turnout by demonstrating the Council’s potential to enact change.
“The best way to increase voter turnout is to really show the student body the UC’s work,” she said.
Salma Abdelrahman ’20 of Elm Yard won the election’s most competitive race, in which 147 students cast ballots for eight candidates.
The second most competitive race was in Adams House, with four candidates vying for two open seats. A total of 73 students cast ballots in the race, ultimately electing Ryan K. Sim ’19 and Anna T. Wechsler ’18.
Of the twelve new members, one is a freshman, four are sophomores, and seven are juniors.
The full list of newly elected representatives is as follows:
Adams House
Ryan K. Sim ’19
Anna T. Wechsler ’18
Cabot House
Saim Raza ’18
Currier House
Anna M. Raheem ’19
Kirkland House
Sophie Mehta ’19
Mai-Linh Ton ’19
Lowell House
Samarth Gupta ’18
Berkeley Brown ’18
Pforzheimer House
Osama Arif ’18

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

With just over a minute left on the clock it looked as if Harvard was on the verge of handing Princeton its first conference loss of the season. Freshman forward Chris Lewis drove inside and laid one off the glass to give the Crimson the 54-50 lead with 1:18 on the clock.
After going down by as many as 13 in the same half, head coach Tommy Amaker’s squad had done exactly what it has done all season long—come back late in a close game.
On Saturday night, however, the magic that carried the Crimson back from a 15-point deficit against Penn the night before was absent in the final seconds. After sending the Tigers to the line where they would make one of two, Lewis would miss both free throws on the other end. A layup from junior guard Amir Bell then put Princeton within one with 21 seconds left to play.
The Tigers fouled Harvard guard Bryce Aiken and the freshman made both to give Harvard a three-point cushion with 15 seconds on the clock. Not many of the 2,195 people taking in the game at Lavietes Pavilion could have called what would happen on Princeton’s next possession.
With the Crimson defending the perimeter against the potential game-tying three, sophomore Myles Stephens drove inside and made a layup and was fouled by freshman guard Justin Bassey.
With seven seconds on the clock, Stephens’ free-throw had the potential to send the game into overtime.
Instead, Stephens’ shot bounced off the rim, and senior forward Steven Cook came up with the offensive rebound. Despite plenty of Crimson shirts in the paint, Cook laid it off the glass to give the Tigers a one point lead with three seconds left on the clock.
A crosscourt pass from freshman Robert Baker found its way into sophomore Corey Johnson’s hands for a last second three-point opportunity, but it only found rim as Princeton escaped with the 57-56 road win.
“First you have to give credit to Princeton,” co-captain Siyani Chambers said. “They came in here and battled hard. It was an ebb and flow game and they stuck with it and were able to pull out a tough win. It stings because we fought back pretty hard and put ourselves in a good position to win, but again credit to them for making some big plays down the stretch and battling back to win.”
What ended as a heartbreaker for Harvard began as one of its closest first halves in conference to date. Poor shooting and rebounding from the Tigers combined with plenty of turnovers from the Crimson made for a close game early on. In the first half alone Harvard turned the ball over 11 times with five coming from Lewis alone.
While the Crimson jumped out to an early lead, timely three pointers kept Princeton within scoring distance early on in the first. The Tigers went on an 11-3 run late in the half to give them an eight point advantage, but a layup from Lewis would end the half with Princeton up by six.
Despite the Tigers pushing their lead to 13 just over five minutes into the second half, the Crimson refused to let up. Back-to-back steals from Lewis would ignite the crowd as he would dunk one and then go to the line after a flagrant foul on the next. He finished the game with 11 points and seven rebounds on 5-of-6 from the field.
“I thought [Lewis] played incredibly well,” Amaker said. “I thought he was the catalyst for us to get back in it when he made those two steals out in the open floor, the big dunk he had and then the flagrant one foul in terms of us getting free throws and the ball back. I thought he was the one who kind of ignited our team and our crowd and kind of put us on the path to make a strong run at them. I’m really proud of him for how he played.”
Late in the second frame Harvard would also lock down on defense, at one point holding the Tigers without a field goal for a period of nearly five minutes midway through the period. The tight defense allowed the Crimson to climb back from the early deficit, but Princeton’s late heroics would give the guests the late win.
“I thought we competed very hard and I thought we did that on the defensive end,” Amaker said. “We dug in and I thought our kids were terrific, I feel like they gave great effort, great energy, fought very hard, battled all the way back. Big shot by Bryce and then we just didn’t close, we didn’t close, we didn’t finish.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every team practices closing out games. You have your strategy if you’re down and need to foul. You have your strategy if you’re up and need to maintain a gap. You have your press defense and your press break. When it comes to executing those plays in a one possession game, however, it’s not as easy as it comes in practice.
This was exactly the case when Harvard and Princeton battled to the wire at Lavietes Pavilion Saturday night. Though the Crimson held the advantage and had the strategy to close out, it couldn’t execute. Instead, Princeton guard Steven Cook corralled an offensive rebound and hit a layup with 2.9 seconds left in the game to defeat Harvard, 57-56.
“I thought they played really, really hard and competed but we didn’t close,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We didn’t make the necessary plays down there at the end to close and win the game so that’s the disappointing part of putting together that kind of effort that these guys played with tonight.
While Princeton fans will remember Steven Cook’s layup to put Princeton up by one with 2.9 seconds to go, a collection of small mistakes on Harvard’s end put the Tigers in a position to steal victory from under the Crimson’s nose.
First, with Harvard up 54-51 after a long three by freshman guard Bryce Aiken, freshman forward Chris Lewis snagged a defensive rebound on the other end of the floor. Lewis was immediately fouled with 34 seconds left on the clock. Lewis—a 62.5 percent free throw shooter—missed both shots from the charity stripe, leaving Tiger forward Spencer Weisz to grab the rebound.
With 21 seconds remaining, Princeton guard Amir Bell pulled his team within one with a layup. But to Harvard, this basket wasn’t a huge scare, as its main goal was to defend the three. With the shot clock off, the home team could try and dribble out the clock, or end up at the free throw line.
With the ball back and 17 seconds remaining, Harvard succeeded in getting the inbounds pass to a strong free throw shooter in freshman guard Bryce Aiken. Aiken—who owns a 90 percent free throw percentage—sunk both shots from the line, extending the lead back to three. The Harvard fans were on their feet.
“[The fans] helped us get the momentum with their noise,” senior co-captain Siyani Chambers said. “They really put them in a tough situation I felt like. They really ratcheted it up with the pressure and we fed off it.”
Again, on the next defensive possession, Harvard needed to defend against the three and avoid fouling. Unfortunately for the Crimson, it just that. Princeton’s Myles Stephens drove to the basket and laid it in while being fouled by freshman forward Justin Bassey.
Stephens had a chance to tie the game with the free throw.
“Worst thing we could do was what we did which is give them a three-point opportunity driving it and fouling,” Amaker said.
But Stephens didn’t make the free throw. He missed. Then the ball hit the ground. Neither Lewis nor Bassey could get their hands on the rebound. Instead, Cook got the ball and went up for the layup. The Princeton fan contingent rose to its feet as what looked like an unlikely ending was happening for the Tigers.
Harvard had one last play. With 2.9 ticks to go, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker called a timeout to draw up a play. Amaker stacked the court with his best shooters. With freshman forward Robert Baker running the baseline, a trio of guards lined half court—Aiken, senior co-captain Siyani Chambers, and sophomore Corey Johnson. Chris Lewis lined up at the opposite foul line behind the line of guards.
Baker was able to inbound all the way to Lewis, who fed Johnson outside the arc. Johnson is Harvard’s best three-point shooter, making 44.4 percent of his attempts on the season. Johnson’s shot was within his typical range, but it missed the hole as the buzzer sounded.
While many individual plays or possessions could have turned the tides of a one-point victory for the Tigers, in the waning seconds, it was a pair of free throw misses, a foul, a missed rebound opportunity, and a missed three that were the demise for Harvard. Had any of these gone differently, the Crimson could have walked off the floor of Lavietes Pavilion with a different reaction than the “sting” described by Chambers.

“We practice these situations in practice, but there’s nothing like the game,” Chambers said. “Things happen, we’re going to watch the film and learn from it and do what we’re supposed to do and learn from some of the mistakes that we made and hopefully we don’t make them again.”

Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow on Thursday, which means we’ve got six long weeks of Boston winter ahead of us. Don’t let the somewhat mild December and January weather deceive you—February in Boston is brutal, so even if there isn’t a repeat of Snowpocalypse 2015, be prepared to bundle up.
Luckily, February is a good time to buy a new winter coat, because stores are already beginning to stock spring clothes and start their end-of-winter sales. Maybe living in a city where it’s winter until April does pay off, after all.
Flyby already shared our review of the ubiquitous Canada Goose coats. But for those of you who don’t feel like dropping at least $800 on a winter jacket: we feel you. Here are some other winter coat options to help you survive till spring break. We’ve collected women’s and men’s coats options, and everything is under $200. Plus, we’ve conveniently sorted our suggestions by your Harvard stereotype for easy browsing.
The Pre-Professional
You’re never caught without at least five backup copies of your resume, and your Google Calendar is overflowing with networking events. You need a coat that you can wear over any outfit, from business-casual to business-cocktail, and that won’t clash with any of your (exclusively black, navy, or charcoal grey, of course) suits. But you don’t have that investment banker money yet, so you need something reasonably priced that only looks expensive. Check out these overcoats from Old Navy (women's and men’s) if you’re ballin’ on a budget. If you’re looking to splurge a little more (who needs to buy textbooks, anyway?) look at these options from ASOS and Zara.
The Mainstream Hipster
Sure, you go to the wealthiest and most famous school in the world, but you’re still a hipster, not that you would admit it. You’re likely on the Advocate or WHRB, your close friends are just as artsy as you are, and you pride yourself on your individual music taste and fashion sense. You want a coat that will keep you warm, but that also would fit in at Oberlin or Reed. You should probably head over to the Goodwill in Davis Square or the Garment District in Central. But if you have no qualms about your purchase profiting global corporations, check out these coats from H&M. (Women’s coats here and here, men’s coats here and here).
“The City” Kid
If you need to clarify which city we’re referring to, this is not you. All of your closest friends are also from New York and went to high school either with you or at a rival prep school. Your wardrobe is pretty much all black, and you need a nice (read: Goose-esque) black parka to complement it. Here are some budget options from Forever 21 and Target, or take advantage of the end of season sales and pick up this Vince Camuto women’s parka or Calvin Klein men’s parka.
