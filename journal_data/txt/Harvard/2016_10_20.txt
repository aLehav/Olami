Physically speaking, Harvard is bad for you. The immense pressure, academic and otherwise, that comes with attending the College leads to not enough sleep, too much alcohol, and unhealthy eating, among other health hazards. It is for these reasons that the College must guide students on the path to physical well-being, in addition to focusing on sexual and mental health.
Last spring, the Freshman Class Committee held its third annual Freshman Health Week, which held events promoting different facets of health, including the mental, the sexual, and the physical. Perhaps due to a relatively new focus on destigmatization, groups and events promoting the former two are well-represented on campus.
Many organizations support all aspects of students’ sexual health on campus, from SHARC to PCC to Contact to Response. These groups address everything from contraception to sexual assault response to general sexual health, and their sex-positive resources and advice make the College better for all of us.
Mental health, while still stigmatized on campus, is thankfully becoming less so due to the efforts of groups like SMHL, which promotes mental wellness, ECHO, which counsels students about eating disorders, and Room 13, which offers nightly drop-in peer counseling. These resources help to combat the stress of being a Harvard student, to the direct benefit of those that access them, and to the indirect benefit of their peers.
So why, then, does Harvard have such a minimal focus on another vital facet of student health: physical well-being—meaning eating and sleeping well, drinking only in moderation, and exercising?
Even groups that do deal with physical health are more often perceived as addressing another facet of student health. Contraception, for instance, which can attempt to prevent sexually transmitted infections, is usually seen as an issue of sexual, not physical, health. Similarly, it seems that eating disorders are rightly seen as an issue of mental health, but rarely also as an issue of physical health, despite their physiological effects.
Perhaps in the effort to correct the historical stigma associated with sexual and mental health, it appears Harvard’s efforts to promote physical health have been severely wanting.
Harvard rarely promotes exercise beyond intramural sports, which, in practice, students are often in charge of promoting to their peers. Harvard Recreation rarely effectively promotes itself, and its presence on campus is rarely felt except by the students that go and seek it. It’s ironic that the College puts lots of effort into rewarding students who attend sporting events but little effort into rewarding physical activity itself, and this should be remedied.
The College’s dining halls offer plenty of healthy and unhealthy options. Past efforts to promote healthy eating in dining halls have had serious flaws, and much more must be done to ensure students receive the nutrition they need by finding effective, fair ways to encourage eating healthily.
Efforts by DAPA to counteract binge drinking are commendable, but they appear strongest during Opening Days of one’s freshman year, and, with a few exceptions, wane after that. Students are happy to take a DAPA survey for a free Camelbak when it is offered, but will also be happy to binge-drink the very next weekend. This culture is not only dangerous, it is unsustainably so, and Harvard must put more energy and resources into combating it. Harvard’s Amnesty Policy is a good start, but proactive efforts must increasingly complement retroactive ones. For instance, emulating Stanford’s so-called “open-door” policy, which encourages students to leave the door open when drinking to promote a safer culture, would be a strong first step.
Perhaps most jarringly, the College apparently puts little to no effort into promoting healthy sleep habits; seeing Lamont Library’s patrons during the wee hours drives home this sad point. Simply put, whatever can be done to combat the amount of sleep deprivation felt on this campus must be done— and that includes the College working to give its students a combination of reasonable workloads and good time-management skills.
Student health resources should not be in a zero-sum game. The College’s focus on maximizing student mental and sexual health should not come at the expense of giving students guidance and resources in the realm of physical health. If Harvard wants to truly prepare citizen-leaders for society, as its mission claims, it must make sure they are as healthy as they are well-educated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer saw a great victory for civil rights in Massachusetts when Governor Charles Baker '79 signed a comprehensive transgender rights bill into law. The law bans discrimination in public places on the basis of gender identity and allows Bay Staters to use the bathrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities that match their gender identity. As the first of its kind in the nation, this law once again puts Massachusetts in the lead on LGBTQ equality. Unfortunately, backlash against the measure continues, in the form of a lawsuit and of a ballot question slated for 2018. We urge courts and voters to reject both.
Though the exact issues at stake differ between the lawsuit and the ballot question—the former asks that churches that host public events to be exempted from certain provisions of the law, and the latter seeks full repeal—much of the opposition to the law purports to stem from the same logically incoherent concern. As argued in a statement by the Massachusetts Family Institute, one of the law’s most vocal and dogged opponents, this concern is that the measure “has opened the door for predators to enter public bathrooms, locker rooms and showers and to abuse this vague legislation.”
This view presumes that the most effective line of defense in preventing sexual assault is the plastic sign adorned with “men” or “women” outside most bathrooms—an assumption that, quite frankly, is hogwash. While we in no way wish to make light of sexual assault as a public safety issue, we do wish to highlight the bizarre train of thought which suggests that guaranteeing rights for the transgender community will somehow stoke sexual violence. In reality, what groups like the Massachusetts Family Institute wish to preserve is their right to discriminate under the guise of public safety and religious liberty. The Family Institute’s statement conceded as much when it denounced the bill as part of “a radical and aggressive agenda of sexual expression and a denial of basic biological truth.”
The legerdemain perpetrated by the law’s opponents is particularly ironic because laws like Massachusetts’ are, in fact, a crucial bulwark against violence. Transgender Americans are far more likely to experience harassment and violence at school, are more likely to attempt suicide as a result, and are more likely to experience discrimination in employment, housing, and in the provision of social services. While opponents of the Massachusetts law have fabricated concerns about safety, violence against the transgender community is a real and pressing concern. This law is part of an ongoing effort to ensure that transgender Americans can live safely and freely.

“When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ‘em by the pussy. You can do anything.”
These words came from presidential candidate Donald Trump, as he boasted to Billy Bush about sexually assaulting women. These are the words of rape culture—a culture of male entitlement over women’s bodies, where women are viewed as objects for sexual consumption, where sexual assault is bragged about and met with laughter.
But these words could’ve easily come from our classmates.
I’ve seen the same sentiments spelled out in group chats between Harvard students—my peers. In these messages, male friends make elaborate schemes to sleep with as many women as possible. They usually target non-Harvard women because they see them as easy targets. They imagine that non-Harvard  women will be readily impressed by their Harvard credentials and also less likely to report them for sexual assault. They exchange tips and tricks for picking up women. They share documents about the women that they have slept with, ranking them on their oral sex abilities as well as their appearance.
The men are often viciously cruel to the women they had worked so hard to sleep with, calling them fat and ugly. They attach photos of women and take turns mocking them for their appearance. They laugh at flat-chested women for their small breasts that would make sexual interactions less desirable. And if the women are not attractive enough, the friends will joke about “putting a bag over her head.” The women in these conversations do not have names, and are sometimes described as “walking vaginas.”
In these group chats, a male friend even shared a video, circulated without consent, of him inserting his fingers into a woman's anus. But these men aren’t stupid. They know what they are doing is wrong, even illegal. They delete the video evidence. And upon confrontation, they admit that what they are doing is problematic. But they also say that it’s universal behavior. They say that all men act this way. They say that it’s just “locker room talk.”
Rape culture unequivocally exists at Harvard. More than 72 percent of undergraduate women have experienced sexual harassment, and 31 percent have experienced sexual assault. And, on our very own campus, men—our own friends and classmates—scheme and brag about using women as objects of pleasure.
You don’t have to be Donald Trump to feel like you can do anything. You don’t have to be Donald Trump to feel like you can verbally degrade women for their “big phony tits,” loudly evaluate them on the size of their breasts, grope their breasts against their will, grab their vaginas without asking like they’re nothing more than a “stuffed animal on the couch,” pressure women to sleep with you, “try to fuck her” and “move on her like a bitch,” and then mock women for being fat and ugly after you sleep with them. Society has made it acceptable for even the most average of men to believe that they are entitled to women’s bodies. You don’t have to be as wealthy or famous as Trump; you could even just be a student at Harvard.
But Donald Trump and his supporters insist that his words and actions are excusable because it’s something that “all men do, at least all normal men do.” Bragging about sexual assault is simply something that happens “when alpha personalities are in the same presence.” Boys will be boys, and should not be held accountable for their actions—even when these “boys” are grown men.
It’s time we hold men accountable for their words and actions. We should hold Donald Trump accountable for his disgusting endorsement and perpetration of sexual assault. And we should also hold the men on our very own campus accountable for perpetuating similarly degrading and misogynistic attitudes.
And, before someone starts yelling #NotAllMen or “playing devil’s advocate” or in some way derailing this conversation about rape culture to talk about how none of this is his fault, we should understand that misogyny is systemic. Systemic oppression has nothing to do with individual guilt, and everything to do with collective responsibility. Rape culture is ingrained so deeply in our society that we all participate in it, often entirely unconsciously. We are all part of the problem—and yes, even women contain a degree of internalized misogyny. One need only look at Kellyanne Conway, Betsy McCaughey, or any other female Trump surrogate who has tried to defend his recent remarks.
Donald Trump should be criticized and even convicted for abusing his position of power to sleep with women, for treating women like sexual objects at his personal disposal, for violating their consent and grabbing their bodies without permission. But unfortunately, this behavior is nothing we haven’t seen before.
We all know a Donald Trump. It could be an acquaintance, a teammate, a classmate, a roommate, or a friend.
It could even be you.

To the Editor:
It is always sad when a great university misses a significant teaching moment. The prolonged strike of food service workers at Harvard is an example of just such a missed opportunity.
Press reports indicate that negotiators are bogged down over two issues: a guaranteed annual income for full-time staffers and health insurance. The first derives from the seasonal nature of the academic year and the inability of many Harvard food service workers to collect unemployment benefits during seasonal layoffs. The second is a universal problem that has an outsized impact on low wage workers like the strikers.
When I studied at Harvard, labor relations greats were on the faculty. I studied with Derek Bok and Archibald Cox and Business School Professors James Healy and Thomas Kennedy. Over the decades since then Harvard has led the way in establishing reasonable—and in some cases generous—labor standards for its employees and its contractors.
Approximately 25 years ago, Harvard set an area wide precedent in the construction industry by entering into a wide ranging project labor agreement for university capital improvements. Brokered by the late John Dunlop, it set meaningful minimum area standards guarantees in exchange for a no-strike commitment on covered jobs. Billions of dollars of construction work has been completed under that agreement and its successors.
More recently Harvard extended its creative problem solving to service employees and service contractors. In an effort to avert a protracted custodians strike the University adopted a “parity policy” extending many of its own meaningful employment standards to its service providers. Not only did that step resolve a labor management dispute, it improved the wages and working conditions of hundreds of area workers and their families.
That creativity and ingenuity have yet to show their face in the negotiations to end this dispute. The University seems dug in and the workers feel disrespected. Local 26, on behalf of hundreds of longtime, loyal employees has brought legitimate issues to the employer’s attention. The response has been disappointing and demoralizing.
As income inequality continues to grow surely the world’s wealthiest university can take the steps necessary to address the legitimate needs of some of its lowest paid workers. Harvard has proven that it has the capability to creatively respond to the needs of its workers. It is time to prove that it still has the will to do so.

This August, Crimson Photographer Megan M. Ross '18 was invited by the Japanese Prime Minister’s Office to produce a multimedia feature about Japan. Traveling with a group of 10 student photojournalists, she spent time in Tokyo, Miyagi Prefecture, Nagano Prefecture, and the island of Hokkaido.  Hosted by the HLAB residential program for high school students, the group participated in cultural activities and met Japanese people of all ages along the way.  Each journalist worked independently to produce a feature focusing on an aspect of Japan that interested them. This photo and video essay explores the culture and customs of Japan, as well as the challenges the country faces in the 21st century, through the eyes of a first-time visitor and her camera.
It’s a hot, sticky morning in Tokyo.  I’m wide awake at 6 a.m., jet-lag lingering two days into my stay.  I put on the first t-shirt and pair of shorts I can pull out of my suitcase. Tiptoeing out of the Japanese-style bedroom, I try not to wake the eight other girls sleeping on rolled-out futon beds on the floor around me.  As mentors for HLAB, an program developed by Ryosuke Kobayashi '13 to introduce Japanese high school students to liberal arts education, they’ll need their sleep ahead of a long day of preparing for the students to arrive tomorrow.  I figure I should walk down the street to the only place I know will be open at this hour on a Saturday morning: Starbucks.
I feel immensely guilty. Here I am, on an all-expenses paid trip to Japan, and I’m buying coffee from the same company that has no fewer than three franchises in Harvard Square. I resolve to at least place my order using what little Japanese I can remember from high school. As it turns out, that’s not a lot. The encounter with the barista reduces to me pointing at a picture of a latte, saying the words ‘iced’ and ‘tall’ and ‘kudasai’ (‘please’), in some order that might be coherent. I recall enough to explain to her that I’m from airurando (Ireland), and to ask her to forgive my poor Japanese. Never before have been so acutely aware of my monolingualism. I pull up Google, and search ‘useful Japanese phrases’.
Before I arrived in Tokyo, I wasn’t sure what to expect from it. I like to describe myself as being from a ‘city’, but Dublin is not exactly a high-density, high-rise, bustling metropolis. We don’t even have a subway system. So I approached Tokyo with a sense of trepidation, unsure if I’d be overwhelmed or enthralled by it, almost certain I’d get lost on the subway at least once.
 What I found was a city bursting with color, rich in history, full of people yet rarely feeling crowded. It was difficult to wrap my head around the scale and density of the city. Living in the larger metropolitan area are about 38 million people—eight times the population of my entire home country, in an area one fifth its size. The busiest subway line, the Yamanote, transports more people per day than the entire London Underground system. While I don’t recommend riding the subway at rush hour, for the most part the city did not feel especially crowded.
Outside Shibuya Station stands the statue of Hachikō, the famous dog who came to the station every day to wait for his owner, Professor Hidesaburo Ueno of the University of Tokyo, to come back from work. Even though Prof. Ueno died about a year after adopting Hachikō, the dog came to the station every day for the following nine years and nine months.
On the warm summer’s day when I visit Shibuya Station, a cat has decided to lay down for a nap on the statue, blissfully unaware of the hoards of tourists crowded around the landmark. It turns out that this cat has been coming to hang out at the statue for over a year. After Hachikō spent nearly a decade waiting faithfully, if in vain, for his best friend to come home, he finally has someone to keep him company at Shibuya Station.
New York City may have phased out its iconic Ford Crown Victoria Taxis from use in the last decade, but still ferrying passengers around Tokyo are a fleet of cars that could be their distant, Japanese cousins. The boxy aesthetic of the Toyota Crown Comforts caught my eye, anachronistic on streets ruled by the sleeker designs of the twenty-first century. Though I’m not sure of the rationale behind the old-fashioned design, I imagine it as a quiet rebellion, a determined refusal to let a good design fade away as cars lost their straight edges and sharp angles in the last thirty or so years.

The Akihabara district was initially known as a hub for electrical goods retailers, especially in the years following the Second World War. Today, large electrical stores remain, but the main attraction of Akihabara is its otaku (“geek” or “nerd”) culture, with plenty of video game, anime and manga stores to go around.
The Senso-ji Temple stands tall and majestic in Asakusa. It is the oldest in Tokyo, having been built in 645 AD (making it almost 1,000 years older than Harvard). The original temple was destroyed by bombs in the Second World War, but was then rebuilt in the 1950s and ‘60s.
Visible from the Senso-ji Temple is the formidable Tokyo Skytree. The four-year-old broadcasting tower is the tallest tower in the world. Tokyo’s architecture and skyline reflect its identity as a city that is both steeped in rich history and a beacon of technological innovation.
After several days in the capital city, we boarded a bullet train bound for Sendai, Miyagi prefecture. From there, we drove to the small town of Onagawa. Onagawa sustained considerable damage in the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, when about one in twelve of its residents lost their lives and 85 percent of its buildings were destroyed. Having grown up in a seaside town, it is difficult to imagine the devastation that Onagawa suffered in the wake of the disaster.
The resilience and determination that the people of Onagawa have displayed in these most trying of times is remarkable. Rather than simply re-creating what was there before disaster struck, the harbor town is instead undergoing a phenomenal re-birth, with new businesses opening up in the town center. You can buy craft beers, paint Spanish tiles, and sip an espresso in just some of the new establishments that have been opened in the last couple of years.
A lot of the problems faced by Onagawa were exacerbated but not created by the earthquake. Chief among is them a sharply declining population, an issue shared by many rural Japanese towns as birth rates fall and migration to urban centers increases. Some of Onagawa’s residents see a sort of silver lining in the disaster: they have an immediate impetus and opportunity to build a new future for their hometown.
Of course, no town that has lost what Onagawa did in 2011 could ever forget those who perished. Dotted around the town are memorials, beautifully and carefully maintained in honor of the souls claimed by the tsunami. A curious feature I noticed at these memorials were the collections of full bottled drinks that had been left—recently, by the looks of them. Our guide explained that it is traditional to leave drinks for people who have drowned, as it is thought that they would be thirsty after taking in so much sea water. He also speculated that the alcoholic drinks left were for someone with a particular fondness for beer. This touched me in a way altogether different from the familiar ritual of leaving flowers for the dead, as a display of the unconditional love of family members, still trying to take care of those they have lost.
I left Onagawa feeling inspired but achingly sad. I grew up in a harbor town and I shudder at the idea of it all just disappearing overnight, taking any number of my family or friends with it. The wounds still feel open and raw in Onagawa, which makes the degree to which this town has managed to recover—at least in terms of its infrastructure—breathtaking. It has a long way to come, with many of its residents still living in temporary housing in the town’s baseball field, but considering the hand it was dealt, it has managed incredibly well.
Another bullet train brought us to the land-locked, mountainous Nagano prefecture, where we were hosted by the HLAB Obuse program. The small town is well-known for its chestnuts and as the home of the Hokusaikan Museum, where many of the influential Edo period artist Hokusai's works are on display.
It’s one thing to be offered dinner and a show, but on one afternoon in Obuse we were offered a lunch that was the show. Nagashi somen - “flowing noodles” - are somen noodles that are served flowing along a bamboo tube. Everyone lines up along the tube and picks the noodles out with chopsticks, dipping them in a sauce before eating. Mildly competitive, certainly the greatest challenge to my chopsticks skills yet, but definitely the coolest way I’ve seen to eat noodles.
As we walked through the town of Obuse on a Saturday morning, we passed a group of senior citizens playing a game of croquet in a small field. They were remarkably active for their apparent age - unsurprising in a country with one of the highest life expectancies in the world. I hoped that I’d still be riding my bike around town at that age, if anything.
When we traveled up to the remote town of Teshio, on the north island of Hokkaido, I was struck by the wealth of skills and knowledge of the land its residents possessed. There was a deep appreciation of nature evident all around, from the woman who took us on a nature walk in a forest, to the fisherman who deftly sorted clams by hand, tapping them to the ground if he suspected they were empty. Standing in a field at Takeshi Uno’s dairy farm, as we learned about how butter was made, and sipped fresh, sweet yoghurt drinks, the bar for what I deem to be ‘good dairy’ moved a few notches higher (and being from Ireland, it was already pretty high).
(Clockwise from top-left) Chie Moue leads a nature walk; Fisherman Yoshikazu Sato works at a clam-sorting machine; Dairy farmer Takeshi Uno answers questions during a tour of his farm; Fisherman Yoshifumi Sugai demonstrates how he can tell at a glance which clams are empty or past their prime.
It was poignant, all the same, to enjoy the fresh food and soak in the gorgeous scenery, knowing that communities like that in Teshio are in serious danger of disappearing in a couple of generations’ time. The migration of locals away from rural areas to urban centers is especially acute in remote parts of Hokkaido like Teshio. The people there have made it a priority to try to breathe new life into the island, in the hopes that the people who grew up there might stay—or even that new people might move there.

Raised in a country that roasts and boils any meat to the point of tastelessness, not all that long ago I would have reeled at the idea of eating any amount of raw fish. In that hotel, I was piling it onto my plate as fast as my western hands wielding a pair of chopsticks could manage (still not that fast). By the time I came back to campus I found myself craving the sashimi and sushi I lived on in Japan.
In fact, I think my tastes have been fundamentally altered by those few weeks. Even when it comes to snack foods, the Japanese seem to operate on a higher plane. I never envisaged myself craving seaweed, but now I lament its absence from my daily routine. You can’t just walk into a convenience store in Cambridge and buy for a couple of dollars wakamegohan (seaweed rice) or onigiri (a riceball with a salted or pickled filling, wrapped in seaweed). I think I even miss the ubiquitous canned coffee.
On the last night of the trip, as we walked through the streets of Tokyo after dinner, one of my fellow journalists turned around to me with his camera rolling and asked me, “What was your favorite part of Japan?”I said the first thing that came to mind: Everything. This is the first time I’ve visited a brand new country and thought, I could see myself living here”. Perhaps that sounds hyperbolic after such a short trip, but as I prepared to travel back to Boston for a new school year, I realized that I wasn’t ready to leave Japan behind.
The country had so much to offer, it would have been impossible to leave it satisfied after just 18 days. My appetite was merely whetted, and I resolved to find my way back there sooner rather than later. Everything from the warmth of the Japanese people to the incredible food, from the gorgeous landscape of the rural towns to the efficiency of Tokyo’s public transport, made me think it would be a fantastic place to live, even just for a few years.
This semester, having gained a new motivation to refresh and improve my knowledge of the language, I enrolled in beginner’s Japanese at Harvard. The next time I visit Japan, I’ll hopefully be able to do a lot more than order a coffee in the local language.

Maybe it was “American Horror Story: Freak Show” that put the idea of something a little darker and creepier in my mind. Maybe I need to admit to myself that I wanted something along the lines of Cirque du Soleil. But when I heard that the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus was coming to town, I didn’t expect to be surrounded by a sea of screaming six- to eight-year-olds.
I arrive at TD Garden amidst a wave of children smacking each other with light-up swords, parents lagging half-heartedly behind. I’m eager to settle into my seat before the circus starts, but a gruff voice stops me.
“You aren’t allowed to bring backpacks into the facility,” the security guard at the door says. “We don’t have lockers and we don’t hold bags.”
Is my journey to the circus being cut short before I see even one clown? And what about all these kids bringing in unchecked weapons? I consider running back to the T-station right this instant, but decide to push onward. Miraculously, a nearby bar agrees to check my bag for a few hours. For a mere $10.
Fifteen minutes later, I’m through security and settled into my seat, five rows up from the center of the stage. A little girl sits next to me with her family, nacho cheese slowly dribbling from the side of her mouth as she gazes in wonder at the performers rushing onto the stage.
It’s more “PBS Kids” than “American Horror Story.” And the second the clowns start singing and dancing like “The Wiggles,” I know I’m in the wrong place.
“Welcome to the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey Circus EXTREME!” the host booms before breaking into something that sounds oddly like the Pokémon theme song. “We’ll take you to exotic lands, adventures far and wiiiiiiiide.”
After the opening scene, it’s apparently time to travel to those so called “exotic” lands. B&B seems to be operating on a budget: Instead of lions or tigers, five camels trot onto the stage and form a ring. Acrobats twirl over and around their humps, gripping them tightly while the ring leader cracks his whip. At first I don’t think he’s making contact with their bristly hides, but I soon realize I’m mistaken.
The girl to my left is entranced. To my dismay, that seems to be the consensus for the kids surrounding me. This animal cruelty is going unrecognized by their wide, admiring eyes.
In the next act, lanterns drop down from the ceiling, girls dressed as belly dancers sashay out, men dressed like hun warriors take center stage—all while a man in a turban prances about. He stops, lifting up his long skirt to reveal a faux-Chinese demon puppet.
Looks like Orientalism hasn’t lost its hold quite yet. I cringe as the girls smile and wiggle while the men lift heavy weights for the entirety of the second act. Better yet, one song lyric goes: “The women have to be careful cause they don’t wear armor.”
Sigh.
Things pick up a little bit after that. Even if they’re showcasing questionable content, the circus’s performers are undeniably talented. Trapeze artists cavort in neon suits, tightrope gymnasts leap over each other at dizzying heights, and the show ends with a bang—the human cannonball. Still, I leave with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth.
Exiting the arena, I corner a group of kids from the Boys and Girl’s Club. “AMAZING!” they squeal in unison. “I loved the neon people!”
When I ask for their thoughts on the animals in the show, one of the boys remarks, “They seem very trained. They stayed in that small circle the whole time!” Maybe traveling around the country in a trailer with four other camels helps them get used to tight quarters.

True southerners are a rare breed at Harvard, but many find a home in the Texas Club, a social group for Texans and lone star state enthusiasts. This week, the club played host to Sarah Isgur Flores, deputy campaign manager for Carly Fiorina’s 2016 presidential run. Flores also happens to be from Texas.
In addition to hosting dinners with succesful Texans, the club organizes more casual get-togethers.  Berkeley E. Brown '18, co-president of the Texas Club, elaborates on the club’s mission.“I think it’s really important to have some connection to home, especially for freshmen,” Brown says.
Flores, sitting to Brown’s right, agrees. “My very existence is owed to a Texas magazine,” she says. Flores explains that her parents met after her mom ran a personal ad in a Houston magazine. She grew up at the end of a mile-long dirt road on a wildlife rehabilitation center. “My whole childhood [was] me, without clothes, surrounded by animals from around Texas,” she says.
Despite her strong Texas ties, Flores decided to move north for college. “I just wanted to get out,” she says, “I was feeling very contained.” She began her undergrad career at Northwestern University as a math major, but, after being placed in a senior level political science seminar due to a scheduling error, she found a new calling in politics.
After applying to 22 internships, Flores landed a position on a Senate campaign. It wasn’t what she expected: “‘The West Wing’ prepared me, obviously, to become chief of staff immediately,” she said. She “wanted to be Josh Lyman,”  but  found herself licking stamps. But amidst all the chaos that is the campaign trail, Flores was sucked into the fast-paced world of start-up politics. She calls the field “a true meritocracy,” and there was no turning back. She wrote mailings and press releases, while unwittingly preparing for her later jobs on Ted Cruz’s 2009 attorney general campaign and Carly Fiorina’s 2016 presidential run.
Flores says her Texan heritage provided a foundation for her political beliefs; however, she hasn’t always identified as a conservative. “I knew every word to 'Rent',” she said, referring to her high school days, adding, “I didn’t seem like a very good Republican at that point.” During her time as a student at Harvard Law School, however, Flores realized that her views aligned closely with those of people she met there, like Ted Cruz.
Her political views may have evolved, but Flores’s love for her home state remains unshaken.
After experiencing the cold winters and attitudes of the north in college, the draw to return home was strong. “Nowhere looks like Texas,” she says. “Even Galveston with its brown water — there’s something to love there.” Like the members of the Texas club, Flores is eager to show her Texas pride, emphasizing that she “likes all things Texas: Texas magazines, Texas journalism, Texas movies.” Despite her busy schedule, Flores plans to fly back home to vote early in the Texas election. She refuses to vote for either major candidate, but she has an idea for a write-in: “My dad would make a great president. He’s very Lincolnian.”

I am in the habit of giving up.
Two weeks ago, for what felt like the hundredth time, my roommates and I debated whether college students like ourselves are interested in dating, or whether we as a species are consigned to a fate of hook-ups, crushes, or, as one painfully apt friend puts it, “aggressive loneliness.”
Much like the previous 99 times, I found myself on the sidelines. Roommate A, who wields a long-term girlfriend as his main piece of evidence, argues that Harvard students want to date—we just need the courage to ask those cuties out. Roommate B, who wields no such girlfriend but carries an admittedly impressive resume of hook-ups, argues the opposite: Harvard students claim to like the idea of dating, but at the end of the day, we don’t really buy it.
I boast no girlfriend or resume, but I do have a Panda.
Panda—who bears a codename due to the threat of thin Mather dorm-room walls and busybody dining hall ears—comes up as a topic in almost all rooming group discussions.
We met my freshman year, though at the time we gravitated towards different social circles. Back then, Panda and I were just casual acquaintances. I knew of them, but didn’t really know them. As Don Draper might say, I didn’t think about them at all.
Over my sophomore year, we grew close. Panda has held me while I’ve cried about my friends; I’ve held them while they cried about a boy. We’ve laughed together. We’ve done the 12 a.m. stumble to Felipe’s and talked about fears, feelings, and life until the busboy gently kicked us out two hours later. We’ve sat on a bench in the Yard until both I and the sprinklers were turned on. I wondered if it could always be so... simple.
This summer, Panda and I texted, almost daily. They said they missed me. I missed Panda, too.  When we got back to school, Panda sent me a text: “Hey,” it read. “I know it’s hard for you to be back here, do you want to talk?” It is and I didn’t, but the text was sweet. I was crushing hard on Panda.
“Ask Panda out, ask Panda out,” chimed Roommates A, B, and C as the school year started. “You’ve got nothing to lose.”
They’re right. This year, Panda and I haven’t been particularly close. My general anxiety-turned-panic regarding the situation and Panda’s lack of emotional depth have led to cold shoulders, ignored texts, and canceled plans on both of our parts. But there’s something very different about rehearsing lines with my roommates and having them on the tip of my tongue as I stare at Panda in Quincy courtyard.
“I...”
“Sorry, what was that?”
“Nothing.”
Which, for me, is all too often how it goes. Pandas just aren’t unique. For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a Panda, and I’ve done the same thing.
There was Playground Panda, who asked if I wanted to kiss behind the swings. “Gross,” I said. “No way.”
There was Dance Studio Panda, who—if my dance coach was to be believed—was sending all kinds of signals. I was 15 and awkward—signals were more frightening than encouraging.
There was Music Practice Room Panda, who really liked me. I liked kissing them, but as the conversations went deeper and the questions became more personal, I pulled away.
There was New York City Panda, with whom I got close quickly. Too quickly.
I guess I find myself somewhere in the middle. There’s a desire, yes, and a fear, heck yes, but it’s not a fear that Panda doesn’t like me back—it’s a fear that they do. Because if it’s a one-sided love (which I’ve had plenty of) I can idealize it, romanticize it, and perfect it. But if it’s real­—when it’s hot, heavy, messy, and real—I have to do something about it. I’m not sure if I want to do something about it, or even if I did, what that something would be. That step into the unknown is scary, it’s vulnerable, and it’s uncomfortable. It’s why I remain stuck in this Panda stage.
Because if I let the Pandas become people, then I have to start treating them as such. Which, at this moment, I’m not ready to do.
So until the next moment, I’ll just keep giving up.

It is a crisp October morning. As I walk briskly down the cobblestones, the cool wind brushes against my face and the early sunlight warms my rosey cheeks. I am shivering, unsure whether it’s a product of the cold, my nerves, or a combination of the two. It has finally come: The day I get to meet the man who raised me through his music, Bruce “The Boss” Springsteen.
It’s 8:05 a.m. and the line already weaves around one corner and then another, stretching halfway up the block ahead. An ignorant passerby might wonder what on Earth could possibly attract so many eager line-waiters so early in the morning. But for us, the Harvard Coop’s book-signing event for Springsteen’s autobiography, “Born to Run,” is an opportunity to meet, even for a mere 15 seconds, the man who supported us through life’s highs and lows.
Policemen and security guards direct me to the end of the line. To my left stands a woman, about 5’2’’ with heels on, using a pocket mirror to apply—or reapply—her dark red lipstick; to my right, a mom, dad, and their daughter  huddle together to conserve body heat.
I am only 19 years old, and that, unfortunately, means I did not get the chance to witness Bruce Springsteen’s ascension to stardom  firsthand. However, I was lucky enough to have a father who did—a father who, for 19 years, has been telling me stories about how he and his friends would listen to “Greeting from Asbury Park” on their old record player so many times that it wore out and they needed to buy it over and over again. Some may call it a strange obsession, but I call it an acquired characteristic—one that my dad has thankfully passed down to me.
My dad is the type of dad who used to cover up the dashboard screen in his car and test me on who was singing in an effort to teach me to differentiate between his favorite classic rock bands. This began as soon as I was old enough to remember to brush my teeth in the morning, and lasted until I started getting practically every single song, artist, and album name correct. Any Bruce song was obviously a no-brainer. Even with my friends in the car, we sang along to Sirius XM’s E Street Radio, and if anyone dared to complain or try to change the station, we would look at each other with a smile and turn the volume up even louder.
Holidays, birthdays and other family gatherings became excuses for us to show off our talent. My dad would play Bruce in every room of the house, and we would sing karaoke-style into scrapers and pie cutters while dancing around the kitchen table. I watched him closely and learned how to work the speaker system myself—not such an easy task for an eight-year-old—so that when I came home from school to an empty house, I could play “Mary’s Place” and “Dancing in the Dark” as I jumped from couch to couch, bed to bed.
When I was about 10 years old, my dad took me to see Bruce for the first time. Overwhelmed with excitement, I made a sign to hold above my head that read “First Bruce concert” with an arrow pointing down. Determined to catch Bruce’s eye, my dad lifted me onto his shoulders, holding my legs tightly to keep me from falling off. In the middle of “Thunder Road,” amid the singing and the dancing, Springsteen turned our direction, and I watched his eyes graze my small, white sign. All of a sudden, he smiled, nodded, and pointed his finger right at me. Overwhelmed by the thrill and emotion, I immediately burst into tears.
Since that day, my obsession has only grown stronger. The older I get, the more I can understand why my dad, and my dad’s generation, were so shaped by Bruce and his music. Behind the words I’ve grown up mindlessly singing lie hidden messages of peace, love and hope. Listening to “The Rising,” Springsteen’s 2002 album, with my dad, I can imagine how his words uplifted the spirits of those affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. My dad vividly remembers watching Bruce perform an acoustic version of “My City of Ruins” on a televised benefit concert about a week after 9/11 while cooking dinner with my mom.
Some of my friends don’t get it. They see my passion for Bruce as bizarre and outdated. They question why I listen to “Rosalita” while I study, why I sacrificed a Wednesday night to go to some concert, and why I refreshed my page for 15 minutes straight in order to guarantee myself the meet-and-greet tickets. Few understand the impact Bruce’s music has had on my relationship with my dad. However, some friends do get it. I’ve made connections with other dedicated Bruce fans on campus who have similar stories of jamming to E Street Radio in the car, attending concerts with their parents, and falling in love with his music and his message. At Gillette Stadium last month, my “Bruce friends” and I stayed standing for four hours straight while Bruce performed the last concert of The River Tour.
As I stand in line to receive my pre-signed book and have my picture taken with Bruce, my dad is living vicariously through me. He FaceTimes me every 10 minutes as I’m waiting, each time asking what I’m going to say to his idol. Tell him this, tell him that. I get the chills just thinking about those 15 seconds.
As I’m waiting, the dad waiting in line next to me looks over.
“Big Bruce fan?” he asks, as his daughter, arms wrapped around his waist, looks up at me and awaits my reply.
“Yeah,” I say with a proud smile. “My dad got me into him.”

The line of fans—approximately 1,000 of them—stretches to Border Cafe, snakes around the corner of Mass. Ave. and Church St., blows past CVS, winds through the door of the Harvard Square Coop, and twists in loops up the store’s massive staircase. In a stuffy corner on the third floor, this yellow brick road of humans arrives at the feet of the wizard himself: Bruce Springsteen, music’s patron saint of grit and soul, who’s still rocking and rolling after four decades atop the charts.
Undeterred by an early wakeup on a Monday, the select few at the front of the line appear downright giddy as they await Springsteen’s entrance on Oct. 10. “My husband says this is like meeting the Pope,” one woman gushes to her companion.
“It’s much better,” the friend replies.
Atop one of the nearby bookshelves, a placard reads “Cultural Studies.” But the hubbub unfolding in the corner—a promotional event for Springsteen’s new memoir, “Born to Run”—provides far more of an education about culture than the tomes on the bookshelf ever could. As fan after fan approaches Springsteen, who’s donning a black leather jacket and grey scarf, the scene becomes a fascinating microcosm of celebrity idolatry and the society that sustains it. Springsteen will never remember the throngs of people for whom this Monday is a lifetime highlight. Listeners can develop intimate yet one-sided relationships with a stranger they know only through the radio. The exalted can seem so very regular standing in a bookstore instead of a stadium; the regular can feel downright exalted standing in the presence of a man to whom they owe a great deal of happiness.
In the zigzagging line to reach The Boss, fans contemplate what to say to this musician who has spoken so powerfully to them. Brian Marcus—a longtime fan drawn to Springsteen in part because he shares the musician’s Asbury Park, N.J., roots—made the trek to Cambridge from New York. His plan for the meet-and-greet is simple: “Thank him for the music.” (In Marcus’s case, that’s quite a bit of music—he has attended upwards of 50 Springsteen concerts.)
Arlington resident Mitzy Pallotta used to jam to Springsteen’s songs with her high school pals in the 1970s, when they “kind of became our theme songs.” Four decades and 11 concerts later, Pallotta intends to tell Springsteen, “Thanks for all the great music and memories.”
Others are less confident about their messages for the star. For Amy Slicer, Springsteen is a generational heirloom—passed along from her father to her, from her to her son Colin. “We’re so nervous. We don’t know what to say [to him],” Slicer laughs, waiting with Colin on the ground floor of the Coop. “We want a hug and a high five and [to] tell him we love him.” Riana Odin, an Emerson graduate from Connecticut, agrees: “I can’t even think of anything. I’m a writer and I have no words.” Odin is one of many who describes this opportunity in hyperbolic terms. “This was number one on my bucket list,” she says. “I honestly didn’t think I’d ever get the chance to meet him, and I’ve always pictured myself fainting when I do.”
In front of a blow-up backdrop of the memoir’s cover, these folks all have their chance to thank or hug or faint. As Springsteen poses for photos, flashing a pleasant if not exuberant smile in each snap, fans manage to personalize their brief moments by his side: One guy shows him a tattoo. The most audacious women plant kisses on his cheek. A burly man declares “I love ya, Bruce” before pulling him in for an unsolicited hug. Some admirers show off their t-shirts, bearing standards like “Occupy E Street” and “Keep Calm and Love Bruce Springsteen.” A lady reminds him that they met at a wedding, when her cousin married his cousin. A two-year-old flashes a “Springsteen for President” button; he hoists her into the air for the picture.
Springsteen elicits a stunning degree of loyalty among his followers. Dave Porter, who has crisscrossed the Atlantic to watch Springsteen play in Ireland and England, credits the star’s easy relatability as the force that has compelled him to attend 35 concerts. “Every part of my life—Bruce has been there,” Porter praises. “Getting married. Having kids. Seeing kids off to college. Everything.”
For Odin, Springsteen’s appeal stems from the magic of his music, the down-to-earth charm of the unapologetic anthems he preaches. She recalls the first time she heard him in fifth grade: “I just remember being in my dad’s car, and 'Born to Run' was playing, and [I was] just thinking that this was the best song I’d ever heard in my short life of 10 years.” She has gone to surprising measures to hear that tune up close, once sneaking past eight security guards at Fenway Park to nab a better spot in the pit of a concert.
To his devotees, Springsteen is the energy of “Born in the USA” and “Dancing in the Dark” and “Rosalita” and all those hits that made listeners love. He is the poignancy of “Glory Days”—the little guy who hit it big but keeps returning to his roots. He is the tenacity of his most recent tour, jamming for four hours at age 67 in front of sold-out crowds. He is the inevitability of his ascendancy to the heights of music and the constancy of his stay there.
All the way back by Border Cafe, Glenn Gardner, a South Shore local, settles in for a long wait. He has the distinct honor—the distinct nuisance—of calling himself the very last person in line. But Gardner does not mind; he has the day off from work for Columbus Day. A calm tableau in a buzzy line, he cracks open his brand-new copy of "Born to Run" and begins to read the first page, the wind ruffling through the pages as the line inches forward. Two hours stand between Gardner and Springsteen, but The Boss is worth waiting for, and his fans are in it for the long haul.

On a quiet, pitch black Friday night, the Franklin Park Zoo looks haunted. A rusty gate is propped open, and behind it stands a smiling woman in a dimly-lit ticket office. Giant plastic giraffes stand next to bright orange porta-potties. A miniature trolley meant for children pulls up, blasting creepy Halloween music. Contrary to what the word “zoo” might suggest, the Midnight Zoo at Franklin Park Zoo is a  “kid-friendly” puppet spectacle, features no animals awake. The only hints of the slumbering creatures are the occasional whiff of animal droppings and some muffled sounds coming from the darkness.
Upon arriving, children and adults alike pile into tiny train cars. The journey begins with the conductor, a college-aged, hoodie-wearing guy with tired eyes, yelling, “Ladies and gentleman, keep your hands and feet in the vehicle at all times.” Guests are captivated by the view as they ride the trolley, which chugs along slowly. The cold jungle is deserted; its eerie monkey bars glinting against the moonlight. It takes a moment to realize that the slide, shrouded in darkness, is meant to resemble the neck of a giraffe. These first notes of terror are just a prelude to the main attraction: The Midnight Zoo.
At the main exhibit presented in partnership with the Puppet Showplace Theater of Brookline, Mass, each guest receives a glow-in-the-dark tattoo. Cast members dress up as kid-friendly dark lords and witches. Speaking in what guests can only assume to be the accent of  medieval guardians of the night, the actors crack jokes and never break character. They lead guests—termed recruits— through the various exhibitions, which feature everything from shadow puppeting to 15-foot-tall, glow-in-the-dark horse dancing. Though not particularly frightening, the theater and puppet designs are admittedly impressive, with artfully constructed glow-in-the-dark elements brought to life by talented actors.
There are only two other non-parent adults at the zoo tonight. “We wanted to try something new,” the couple says before returning to staring at the googly-eyed frog puppet that an actor is stroking. A few minutes later, everyone is sprayed with some unknown liquid. The grownups might seem confused, but the children are in their element.
The Midnight Zoo is an ideal spot to re-live nightmares from our toddler years and despair about future Friday nights.

Fifteen Minutes chatted with Marne Levine, the Chief Operating Officer of Instagram, after she spoke to 1,800 undergraduate women at Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business’ Intercollegiate Business Convention on Saturday.
FM: You gave a commencement speech at Miami University in May. How did you prepare to present to such a large group of people?
ML: I felt so honored to be asked. When you are asked to go back to your alma mater and give advice, too—it’s something that I took really seriously, and [I] wanted to think through what the best possible advice was that I could give. So I thought a lot about it, and... I decided to focus on the rookie advantage. I just think that when you’re coming out of school, you might think, “I don’t have many skills. I don’t have much experience yet.” But the truth... is that you bring common sense, you bring a fresh perspective, you bring fresh eyes, you bring problem-solving skills and critical reasoning that you develop in college. And you can apply all of those things to whatever situation you’re faced with. The last thing that I really wanted to get across is that so many people come at things with fresh perspectives... but the last step to being an MVP rookie is to take action and really do something about it.
FM: Would you say that you still approach life from this “rookie” vantage point?
ML: I love that! Yes, I think so. I really do. My favorite question is “Why?” I think it can be really helpful—I also think it can be annoying to people at times, I’ll admit that. But I really do try to understand why are we approaching it this way, does it makes sense, is this the right answer, why is it the right answer, are there other paths to getting there, could those be better. It pushes people to think and moves the conversation forward. It also helps me understand it more deeply. It’s a question I ask a lot at work, at home, [and] with my children.
FM: Can you explain the “Be the nerd” Instagram campaign?
ML: Mark Zuckerberg had done a post, and somebody had written in the comments section: “I hope someday my daughter marries a nerd like you.”... Mark responded within seconds and said, “I hope one day your daughter is the nerd.” There is a woman who works at Instagram... and she was so inspired by this that she decided that she would start an Instagram account that was called “Be the nerd” and then she would talk to different women who could inspire people and bring out their inner nerd. I just thought it’s fantastic that she took the initiative to do this—I thought it would inspire people to get excited about embracing that nerdy side of [themselves], because it’s a great thing.
FM: What’s your favorite Instagram innovation?
ML: Instagram Stories. I am really excited about it. I think Instagram is such a great platform: It’s so creative; it’s so visual; it’s an incredible way to experience the world through images, whether photo or video. I also think that our community is incredible, in the sense that it’s such a passionate community connecting around shared interests. But what we found is that people were sharing their highlights... like that really amazing sunset, or that great-looking latte. And those are great things that I love seeing on Instagram—they inspire me; they excite me; I delight in them; it’s great. But the human experience is about so much more than that. There are polished moments, and then there are really raw moments. It’s not that the polished moments are inauthentic—I think polished moments can be completely authentic.
FM: What’s your favorite Instagram filter?
ML: I have a bunch. I think Ludwig might be my favorite. I can’t really exactly say why, but that’s the one I probably use most often.
FM: In what ways does your job at Instagram differ from your time at the White House as the Chief of Staff of the National Economic Council and Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy?
ML: I think the difference is that I worked a ton in the White House, and I work a ton at Instagram too, but I have more flexibility [at Instagram]. When I was at the White House, you’re sort of chained to the building. The technology wasn’t as good then. It’s gotten better, but still, there are meetings that are happening, and you have to be there, and there is certain protocol. Whereas [at] Instagram... I just have more flexibility. So I can get home. I try to be as present with my kids as possible. There’s still the volume of work, but it’s just more flexible, which is a really great thing about it.
FM: What is the best or most rewarding part of your job at Instagram?
ML: One thing that’s pretty incredible is getting to travel around the world... and getting to meet people who have taken a passion or an idea and turned it into a business... [via] Instagram. I was recently in Australia, and I met this woman named Samantha Hobb... She was looking for a rocking chair  that she could put in [her baby’s] room, and she wasn’t finding the kind of rocking chair that she wanted, so she designed one herself. She took a scrap piece of paper and designed it, and she took a photo of it and put it on Instagram... Someone saw it whom she didn’t know and asked where they could get one. And before she knew it, she had sold out of her first production because so many people had started inquiring about this. Her story is fantastic, but it’s not totally unique. I’m just meeting so many people, particularly women, who have this passion or idea and have turned it into a business… and what I’ve learned through a lot of these experiences is that business is personal. I’ve just heard so many stories from different parts of the world, from this country, and that I would say is one of the big highlights of the job.

“This molecule is really unlike any other molecule that biologists have ever studied, before or since,” says Matthew S. Meselson, Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences.
The biologist’s past work includes some of the most celebrated advancements in the history of biological research, and any biology textbook would be incomplete without mentioning his accomplishments. Most notably, he discovered the semi-conservative replication of DNA with Frank Stahl in 1958.
Meselson is modest. “In a sense, in this field, everything would be discovered within some short time if it hadn’t been discovered then,” he says. As he speaks, he mimics an unwinding double helix with his fingers.
After observing French biochemist Jacques Monod studying gene expression in E. coli, Meselson created a new method of density gradient centrifugation. Later, when he read about Watson and Crick’s 1953 discovery of the double helical structure of DNA, Meselson immediately saw the application of his new technique to understanding DNA replication. Meselson worked on the project with biologist Frank Stahl, whom Meselson says revolutionized the way that microbiologists study genetics, in what he considers “the most beautiful experiment in biology.”
Meselson was also on the research team responsible for the discovery of messenger RNA, a major component of protein manufacture in cells. Today, he is busy researching sexual reproduction in microorganisms called rotifers.
Meselson, who attended graduate school at The California Institute of Technology, also teaches several Molecular and Cellular Biology courses at Harvard. “I thought it was almost a duty as an American citizen that I had to know something about this very different place - the East Coast,” he says, remembering his arrival at Harvard in 1960. “It really did seem like there was a totally different culture.”
Though he originally intended to stay at Harvard for only five years, Meselson’s involvement in the world of politics kept him on the East Coast for nearly 20. Meselson joined the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, working with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to restrict the use of chemical and biological weapons. 
Meselson rarely speaks his own accomplishments without weaving through the vast history of achievements by other great scientists of the past: Mendel, Darwin, Einstein, and his own past mentors Max Delbrück and Linus Pauling, whose black-and-white photographs hang next to Meselson bookshelf. Meselson believes that the essence of science is the ability to appreciate the great discoveries of the past.
“We’re each a link in a chain, that’s what life is,” Meselson says. “The links that preceded you and that will follow you, that’s the way to think of it. We have some idea where it came from.”
Before we part, Meselson asks me to peer into his microscope. “You want to see the little animals I work with?” he asks, indicating the rotifiers.
“Like any scientist, I’m always thinking about tomorrow’s experiment,” Meselson says. “Where is science taking us? We don’t know. We all feel very modern now, but it won’t last.”

The year was 1984 and the mouse had cancer.
Philip Leder and Timothy A. Stewart, working out of Leder’s Harvard lab, had finally perfected the process of injecting mice with carcinogenic genetic material.
It’s hard to overstate how important these small, sick vermin were. For years, researchers at competing institutions had tried to find a way to create a reliable supply of cancer-ridden mice for research. With Leder’s and Stewart’s discovery, the study of cancer became far easier.
The medical implications of the discovery are only one part of the story, though. That same year, Harvard submitted a patent application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a “non-human” animal containing a carcinogenic gene sequence. When the application was finally accepted in 1988, Harvard exclusively owned the idea of giving a mouse cancer.
That patent kicked off a decades-long series of Harvard patent filings for the mouse, all of which raised pressing questions about the ethics of profiting from an essential cancer research tool. Leder’s and Stewart’s “Oncomouse” changed not only the face of cancer research, but also the way universities manage their intellectual property.
Intellectual property has a long and complicated history. In the United States today, it comprises three main entities: patents, trademarks, and copyright. Trademark deals with the names or brands of things (Coca-Cola, Harvard’s crest, “CS50”). Copyright deals with works of authorship (books, plays, poems).
Patents cover inventions—products or processes that solve a particular technological problem. If you hold a patent on something, you control, for the 20-year lifespan of the patent, who uses that invention. Patent holders can choose to license their inventions for a fee to others interested in using them or withhold their use altogether. Licenses can be exclusive (meaning no more than one licensee can use the invention) or non-exclusive.
At universities, the process by which inventions made in the lab are patented and subsequently commercialized is known as tech transfer. At Harvard, like virtually every other research university in America, tech transfer is managed by the school itself. While researchers are listed as inventors and are entitled to a cut of any royalties, the university ultimately owns and manages all patents. Specifically, these decisions fall to the “tech transfer office,” which at Harvard is called the Office of Technology Development.
If Harvard’s purpose is, to borrow the language of its current president, “the creation and dissemination of knowledge,” the Office of Technology Development (OTD) has significant control over the dissemination portion of that mission as well as the increasing levels of corporate-funded research at Harvard.
Ever since 1980, when universities were first allowed to own the inventions developed in federally-funded research labs, the tech transfer process has necessitated trade-offs between their profit and the public good. Since the Oncomouse, universities like Harvard have attempted to reorient tech transfer efforts to empower faculty inventors and benefit society. However, to some non-faculty inventors, like the undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs who often work with tenured professors, the process does not always seem fair. Some say that Harvard’s tech transfer process allows faculty to take the lion’s share of both the profit and prestige of successful inventions, leaving other inventors unsupported.
As Harvard, like many research universities, focuses increasing attention on the engineering disciplines, these ethical issues will become more urgent than ever.
***
Harvard’s management of the Oncomouse patents attracted significant criticism. After securing the patent for the mouse, the University licensed its invention exclusively to Dupont, a Virginia-based industrials conglomerate and a big financial backer of Leder’s lab. Any lab hoping to use “oncomice” for research had to buy them through Dupont.
According to intellectual property scholar Jacob H. Rooksby’s recently-released book “The Branding of the American Mind,” Dupont sold the mouse at about five times the cost of other experimental mice and also required buyers to agree to “reach-through rights.” The agreement required customers to give Dupont a cut of the revenues from any invention made using the Oncomouse.
Rooksby describes Harvard’s Oncomouse dealings as a clear sacrifice of the public good in favor of higher licensing revenues. That the taxpayer-funded National Institute of Health in large part bankrolled the invention of the mouse makes Harvard’s actions seem even worse to Rooksby.
“This was public funding that led to this discovery,” Rooksby says in an interview. “So I think it is incumbent on these institutions… to use these patents in the public interest.”
Sitting in his Smith Center office 32 years after Harvard filed its first Oncomouse patent application, current head of Harvard’s OTD Isaac Kohlberg says a lot has changed.
“I can only say that we have learned a lot since then,” Kohlberg says. “I know we don’t structure agreements like this anymore.”
Now, according to Harvard Medical School professor Bruce Bean, “research tools” like the Oncomouse are seldom even patented, let alone licensed exclusively to one company.
These days, Kohlberg says, OTD’s “mission [is] all about societal impact,” and serving the public interest.
“You have to hold this mission,” Kohlberg says, shaking his fists animatedly in the air. “The societal impact comes first. And when you hold this view, you hold it like a mountain.”
At OTD, Kohlberg oversees a 50-person staff littered with Ph.Ds and J.Ds. This highly credentialed group has the final say over what Harvard patents and how it uses those patents. The challenge for his team, one that Kohlberg thinks his staff has “really mastered,” is “striking the balance” among “an intersection of competing interests between universities and schools and the external world and the faculty.”
As they exist today, tech transfer offices like OTD trace their origins to 1980. That year, four years before the creation of the Oncomouse, President Jimmy Carter signed the Bayh-Dole act. For the first time, universities could retain ownership of (and patent rights to) any inventions resulting from federally-funded research. Previously, the government owned that intellectual property.
By placing the onus for commercializing inventions on individual universities, Congress made a bet that universities could translate inventions from the lab to the market better than the government could.
David Winwood, president of the Association of University Technology Managers, the industry lobbying group for tech transfer, says that before Bayh-Dole, when the government owned the intellectual property resulting from federally funded research, “things [would] just go away and die” post-invention.
“It’s proven a successful mechanism to take basic discoveries [and] pass them through this translational process into the private sector,” Winwood says.
Bayh-Dole also created a new potential revenue stream for universities. Now, schools can license discoveries exclusively to one company (as Harvard did with Dupont for the Oncomouse) or non-exclusively to many. They can also create their own start-ups and license patents directly to them.
The second part of OTD’s mission, Kohlberg says, is “the generation of revenues that then flow back into research.”
In fiscal year 2016, Harvard brought in $37.8 million in licensing revenues from its patent holdings. Though certainly not nothing, this sum pales in comparison to Harvard’s total research expenditures, which in 2014 exceeded $800 million.

“[Tech transfer] is not profitable for the university as a business,” says former MIT tech transfer head Lita Nelsen. “If you look at it statistically across the country, the total returns... [are] about 4 percent of the research budget that spawns it,” Nelsen says. “Statistically, it’s not very much.”
What’s more, Nelsen says, the bulk of licensing revenues can come from just a handful of successful patents. It’s often difficult to predict which patents will do well on the market before deciding whether to file an expensive patent application (applying for a patent costs around $30,000). Nelsen believes universities go through all this trouble for relatively little profit because of their desire to benefit the public good.
“You’re not going to get rich from tech transfer unless you get lucky,” Nelsen says. “But if that’s how you plan on getting rich, buy lottery tickets.”
***
Harvard and Kohlberg, as it turns out, did get pretty lucky this year. More than half of this fiscal year’s licensing revenues came from pharmaceutical company Merck’s $20 million upfront licensing for a molecule developed by chemistry professor Matthew Shair. That molecule may lead to new drug options for a certain type of leukemia. In addition to the upfront payment, Harvard can expect royalties if Merck develops a usable drug.
Though patenting and licensing constitute a lot of OTD’s duties, the office also focuses heavily, as its name might suggest, on the development of technologies.
“When I came here we changed the name from ‘Technology Transfer’ to ‘Technology Development’ because it’s not just the transfer that we do,” Kohlberg says. “We develop [inventions] together with our innovators.”
In 2007, two years after Kohlberg’s arrival, OTD launched what it called a “biomedical accelerator” to fund Harvard research projects that seem promising, but are not yet developed enough to attract outside investors. Any Harvard professor working on such a project can apply to the accelerator for a grant. The accelerator, since funded by a $50 million gift from the Blavatnik Family Foundation, supported Shair’s early work on the molecule.
“I couldn’t have done it without the Blavatnik Accelerator,” Shair says, sitting in his third-floor office in Mallinckrodt labs.  These labs have churned out some of Harvard’s most successful patents and start-ups.
Shair turned to OTD after initially reaching out to federal funding sources.
“When he first had these ideas to commence his research, the NIH turned him down. Can you imagine? The NIH!” Kohlberg says. Only about 18.1 percent of applications for National Institute of Health grants eventually receive funding. “He goes to the NIH with a grant application to sponsor work, to develop a drug... for a cancer that there is no treatment for. NIH turned him down… Then he came to the Blavatnik accelerator, we started to fund it, and then we funded it up to a point that it really became of great interest.”
OTD worked closely with Shair throughout the process of deciding which pharmaceutical company to work with.
“Every time I went to a company a person from OTD would come with me,” he says.
Shair considers the accelerator, as well as the constant contact he had with OTD, hallmarks of Kohlberg’s decade-long tenure.
“Isaac has really focused on doing what’s best for investigators, for the faculty, for the programs, for the valuation of those programs,” Shair says.
Alán Aspuru-Guzik, another chemistry professor, also holds Kohlberg and the OTD in high esteem.
“Since Isaac Kohlberg is here, OTD is like Real Madrid and Barcelona,” Aspuru-Guzik says, referring to two of the world’s most dominant soccer teams. “They are really first class.”
Aspuru-Guzik most recently worked with OTD to commercialize his research on OLED technology, a special kind of LED light that works better in darker environments. The work was sponsored by Samsung, which is interested in the potential uses of OLED technology in their products, according to Aspuru-Guzik.
In addition to directly funding some projects through accelerators, OTD also coordinates research with corporate sponsors. From fiscal year 2006, the year Kohlberg arrived at Harvard, to fiscal year 2016, the amount of corporate-sponsored research funding at the University has more than quintupled, from $9.1 million to $48.4 million. Like the accelerators, this focus on corporate funding has been driven in part by flagging federal support for research.

In addition to attracting funding from the corporate world, OTD facilitates the movement of graduate students from the academy to the marketplace. Start-ups based on inventions created in the lab provide jobs for graduate students and post-docs in an often-anemic academic job market. In such cases, OTD oversees the transfer of human talent as well as intellectual property.
“If you ever become my grad student, you will become a bottle eventually,” Aspuru-Guzik says, gesturing toward a shelf of empty champagne bottles in the corner of his office. In chemistry, it is traditional to mark a graduate student’s graduation with a bottle of champagne. Many of Apsuru-Guzik’s bottles are now working for start-ups, as opposed to research universities.

While Kohlberg’s OTD seems to have impressed certain faculty, a recently-settled high-profile lawsuit alleged that perhaps OTD’s coziness with professors comes at the expense of protecting the intellectual property claims of non-tenured researchers like graduate students and post-docs.
The lawsuit in question was brought by former Harvard graduate student Mark G. Charest against both the University and chemistry professor Andrew G. Myers, Charest’s graduate advisor.
Charest and other graduate students worked in Myers’s lab to develop a synthetic version of a type of antibiotic. Myers told Charest that if they succeeded, they would make  “a [explicative] (sic) billion dollars,” according to court records.
The group was ultimately successful and Charest was listed as the first author when the group published their findings in the prestigious journal “Science.” (First authorship is traditionally granted to the researcher who made the greatest scientific contribution to the work.)
So, when OTD licensed the discovery to Myers’s start-up, Tetraphase, Charest assumed he would get an equal share of the 35 percent of royalty revenues that OTD gives to inventors (the rest goes to Harvard departments). When it came time to divvy up the royalties, however, OTD gave Myers a full 50 percent of the inventors’ royalties, and the other four inventors had to share the other half. Charest’s complaint also alleges that Myers conspired with OTD to “enrich [himself] at the expense of the non-faculty inventors.”
Myers did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article and Kohlberg said he had nothing to add to earlier University comments on the case, which denied wrongdoing on Harvard’s part.
When Charest expressed his concerns to Myers, the professor allegedly told him to “tread lightly,” “be careful,” and to “ think about [his] career.” Later, according to the complaint, Myers refused to act as a reference for Charest when the latter was applying for a job at a venture capital firm, despite having given him a glowing recommendation before the dispute.
Like most intellectual property lawsuits, the Charest case was complicated and contentious. In addition to addressing the antibiotic patent dispute, it also raised concerns that Harvard’s intellectual property appeals process was insufficient. In a January 2014 hearing, federal judge Douglas P. Woodlock described Harvard’s process as “pretty shoddy stuff.”
When Charest brought his complaints to OTD, the University had no standing committee on intellectual property, despite the provision for such a committee in Harvard’s public intellectual property policy. Instead, then-Provost Steven E. Hyman appointed an ad hoc committee to handle Charest’s complaint. Charest alleged that the committee had a conflict of interest given that it was “comprised of science professors with ongoing commercialization projects with OTD.”
“The fishbone in my throat is the degree to which the [intellectual property] appeal that was offered [by Harvard] is... like a teasing illusion, like a munificent bequest in a pauper’s will,” Woodlock said at the hearing. He described Harvard’s lack of a standing committee to handle disputes as evidence of its “raggedy-ass approach” to intellectual property complaints.
Ultimately, the court dismissed five of Charest’s seven claims, including all charges against Myers. Before the other two claims, including one about the alleged lack of fairness in OTD’s appeals process, could proceed to trial, Charest and Harvard settled.
“One of the reasons [the appeals process] may be ‘raggedy-ass’ is because [Harvard] had never actually had to go through it before,” said Michael J. Tuteur, the attorney representing Harvard, at the Jan. 2014 hearing. “And maybe this is a lesson learned.”
In one respect at least, OTD has not yet learned its lesson. Harvard still has no standing committee on intellectual property to resolve potential disputes, despite a detailed description of the duties of the non-existent committee in Harvard’s intellectual property policy.
Asked about the committee, Kohlberg says “it is something we are considering,” before adding that “there will be” a committee at some point. Kohlberg insists he is not concerned that Harvard’s tech transfer system disadvantages graduate students.
Charest’s attorney, Brian O’Reilly, believes Charest’s case will inspire other graduate students to speak out about unfairness in the intellectual property process.
“I’ve had a number of students and postdocs approach me with issues they’ve had,” O’Reilly told The Crimson this summer. “I think we’ll see an increasing willingness on the part of students to challenge these power imbalances in their universities.”
Nelsen says that when she led MIT’s tech transfer office, she did not encounter many cases like Charest’s, but admitted that such disputes are “unpleasant” when they do arise.
“Whenever you’ve got money on the table you’re going to have fights, but it was rare,” says Nelsen. “It’s not the kind of thing that you want to spend time in the newspapers.”

Graduate students are not the only non-faculty researchers at Harvard working on potentially patentable work. As student interest in engineering disciplines has skyrocketed over the past few years, more and more undergraduates are inventing materials that OTD could patent.

Every undergraduate student pursuing an Engineering Sciences degree, for instance, must take ES96, a class structured as one long engineering project in which students work to solve a real-world problem. In past years, students in the class helped Harvard’s Facilities and Maintenance office remove snow from campus, and developed potential ways Harvard’s facilities could respond to climate change.
In the spring of 2015, kitchenware retailer Williams-Sonoma wanted a better barbecue. The company tasked the class, taught by bioengineering professor K. Kit Parker, with devising a better way to smoke brisket, a notoriously difficult meat to cook. The class aimed to create a high-tech variant on the popular “Big Green Egg” barbecue smoker.
For a semester, students spent hours every week smoking hunks of barbecue brisket, often working until the wee hours of the morning.
“I smoked so much and was there for so many of the smokes that I actually destroyed the goblet cells in my eyes. By the end of the class I’d had 12 conjunctivitis attacks, pinkeye essentially,” says Michel Maalouly ’16. “I’d end up having literally pus all over my eyes, 12 times. So by the last smoke that lasted 96 hours for the final presentation I was wearing goggles. I was wearing a mask.”
Through pus and pain, though, Maalouly and his classmates kept working on the smoker.
“I’d get an attack, I’d go to UHS, two hours later I’d be back on the barbecue,” says Maalouly.
Parker drove the grueling pace and high standards, according to students in the class. Early in the course, Jerry Chang ’16, another member of the class, learned, in no uncertain terms, that his PowerPoint slide-making skills were not up to Parker’s standards.
“Scrub this crap again. I want the fonts done properly and images I can read,” wrote Parker in an email Chang shared with The Crimson. “You better step up your game if you want to be an engineer because your attention to detail is bested by a Starbucks Barista right now, much less an engineer that builds things that matter.”
“If you don’t do well with harsh, intense criticism, don’t work with Parker,” advised one student in a Q-Guide course evaluation.
Parker wrote in an email that it would be “highly inappropriate” to comment on individual students in the class, adding that he was “very proud of the students in that class.”
“[The course] marks a phase transition from being a student to being an engineer… and that is not a routine transition. Its very hard,” Parker wrote. “My goal is to produce the best engineers in the world, worthy of society’s trust and prepared to meet their needs with technological options for policy makers to choose from.”
The smoker the class produced was quite successful, winning the praise of barbecue experts and a slew of positive media coverage from outlets like the New York Times, the Boston Globe, NPR and Wired. But behind the acclaimed barbecue smoker was an intellectual property process that left some with a bad taste in their mouth.
As it became clear that patenting the invention might make sense, Parker and course teaching fellow A. Peyton Nesmith asked students to notify course staff which parts of the project they felt they had contributed to and to turn over their design notebooks, which students maintained throughout the semester to record what intellectual property they had worked on. Ultimately, 10 students were awarded inventorship on a patent application for the smoker.
In addition, Harvard filed a second application that listed only Parker, Nesmith, and three students as inventors. Parker and at least two students from the class then created a company, “96 Solutions,” (since renamed “Desora”) to develop and ultimately sell the smoker.
In the eyes of some students, this second patent was an attempt by Parker to control the terms of any potential commercialization of the smoker. Both Chang and Austen Novis, another student from the course, saw this second patent that way
But OTD staffer Mick Sawka said that students had no cause for concern, writing in an email that Harvard would allow students access to any intellectual property “needed to practice the invention developed during the class.” Citing ongoing negotiations between OTD and Desora, Parker deferred all comment on the intellectual property to OTD.
Still, Novis felt that the intellectual property discussions were “not transparent at all.”
Maalouly, on the other hand, found the handling of the patent process fair and transparent. He later joined Parker’s company and is currently working on developing the smoker. Maalouly argued that even if he wanted to, Parker would not be able to claim the intellectual property all for himself.
“[Parker] does not have the power to decide what happens to the IP,” says Maalouly, citing OTD’s ownership of Harvard-supported patents.
The office’s self-professed commitment to faculty collaboration, however, suggests professors would have significant input in intellectual property decisions.

Winwood, the lobbying group head, says that many people who criticize the tech transfer process do not really understand it.
“One of my predecessors… said ‘the problem is, our story has to be told in tomes, and we live in a bumper sticker community,’” Winwood says. “Everybody wants the soundbite, and it’s really complicated stuff.”
Complicated or not, it looks like tech transfer issues will only become more urgent, both at Harvard and nationally.
In the past 10 years, Harvard has filed more patents, launched more start-ups, and granted more licenses than ever before, according to data compiled by AUTM, the tech transfer lobbying group. At Harvard specifically, an institutional pivot to the engineering disciplines, including a new multi-million dollar engineering campus in Allston, all but assures a larger role for tech transfer in the near future.
And while Kohlberg and the tech transfer industry may have “learned a lot” since the days of the first Oncomouse filings, the laws surrounding intellectual property in higher education have changed relatively little since Bayh-Dole.
Shades of the Oncomouse controversy have continued to dog OTD. As recently as 2012, Harvard filed a federal court appeal to extend the life of some Oncomouse-related patents that the U.S. patent office had deemed expired. According to OTD spokesperson Caroline Perry, Harvard was legally “obliged” to file these appeals because of the terms of its original agreement with Dupont in the 80’s.
Tech transfer offices are still legally able to do all the things that made the Oncomouse agreement such a target of criticism. OTD still has extraordinary amounts of largely unchecked control over what happens to the knowledge and inventions produced in Harvard’s halls. Whether OTD wields that power responsibly depends almost solely on whether Kohlberg’s office truly holds on, “like a mountain,” to its stated mission of prioritizing the public good.
Rooksby, the intellectual property scholar, worries that despite its stated mission, OTD and offices like it might be more interested in making money than they like to let on.
“Often there’s a focus on revenue above all else, because that’s how you make your boss happy. Several [tech transfer managers] have said to me off the record ‘that’s how you get recognized in this business.’” Rooksby says. “You get noticed by generating revenue against all odds.”
Rooksby added, though, that for “more financially stable” institutions like Harvard ($2 billion hit to its endowment notwithstanding), there is less pressure to produce revenue at all costs.
One way to ensure that offices truly act in the public good, says Rooksby, is to promote broader public understanding of the tech transfer process.
“Intellectual property as a topic is misunderstood… but the issues are important,” says Rooksby. “They are important in isolation and in aggregate. These problems are too important and too impactful on the public to just let the lawyers figure them out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 20, 2016, at 3:35 p.m.
The vast majority of 115 academic dishonesty cases the College’s Honor Council heard last academic year occurred in courses offered in the Sciences Division or the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, according to the adjudicating body’s first-ever annual report.
In addition, members of the Class of 2018 were the most likely to have been investigated, and the most common assignment type the Honor Council investigated was problem sets. 
Out of all cases brought before the Honor Council, the body found that about three-quarters of students investigated had violated the College’s Honor Code. In total, 44 percent of all students investigated were found responsible for an academic integrity violation that resulted in a “change in status,” with measures ranging from probation to requirement to temporarily withdraw from the College; no one was dismissed from the College last year on the grounds of academic integrity.
Forty-three percent of cases in which students were found guilty resulted in disciplinary probation, and 16.3 percent of guilty cases resulted in a requirement to withdraw.
The Honor Council—the administrative body composed of students, faculty, and administrators that adjudicates cases of academic dishonesty—emailed the data to College students Wednesday morning. The report marks the first the body has released since its debut last fall, after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to approve the first-ever Honor Code in spring 2014.
The Honor Code’s rollout came after a massive cheating scandal in a government course swept the College in 2012. Administrators called it “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory,” and more than 100 students were initially implicated for inappropriately collaborating on a final exam.
This year’s Honor Council showed that considerably more cases involving sophomores than any other class year.The report indicated that the differences across class years “merits further investigation,” but added that students’ sophomore years are often “characterized more generally by times of transition, from Yards to Houses, and from introductory classes to courses more directly aligned with concentration plans.”
Additionally, more than  90 of the 115 total cases heard by the Honor Council fell under the Sciences Division and SEAS, with students in humanities classes seeing the fewest number of appearances before Honor Council.
This year’s report concludes by noting the College and students can work on clarifying what assistance is available and “what the realistic consequences of incomplete work will be.”
At a town hall Wednesday evening hosted by the Honor Council to discuss and solicit feedback on the report, Associate Dean for Academic Integrity and Student Conduct Brett Flehinger and undergraduates on the Council discussed potential opportunities to reduce instances of plagiarism and inappropriate collaboration.
On plagiarism specifically, Honor Council Nathaniel R. F. Bernstein ’17 said he sees “real opportunities for pedagogical intervention,” specifically in teaching students how to better paraphrases in their academic writing. Regarding improper collaboration on assignments and problem sets, Nina Srivastava ’18, another member of the body, noted a need for individual courses to clarify collaboration policies.
Flehinger added that the Honor Council will look to partner with individual departments in the future, hoping to spark conversations about integrity within undergraduate concentrations.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana attended the beginning of the event and provided opening remarks.
During the 2015-2016 academic year, the Honor Council was comprised of 26 voting members. In addition, the Council had 12 Student Academic Integrity Fellows—undergraduates trained in the policies of the Honor Council but who do not have voting powers, provided assistance to students going through the Council’s process. Flehinger said he was pleased with the SAIF program’s success, as a majority of students who sought additional support in the Honor Council hearing process chose to work alongside a SAIF.

CORRECTION: October 20, 2016
On second reference, a previous version of this article incorrectly indicated incidents from courses within SEAS and the Social Sciences Division represented the most honor council cases last year. In fact, SEAS and the Sciences Division did so.

Representatives from NASA, Space Systems Loral, and SpaceX discussed the future of laws governing outer space during a panel at the Law School Wednesday.
As technology advances and the possibility of humans populating other planets comes ever closer, panelists proposed potential methods of expanding current law practices to fit a new frontier that is not on Earth—a sort of “space law.”
Stephen F. Meil, a Law School student and editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, the organization that organized the event, said there were few formal programs in "space law" in the country. For NASA Chief of Staff Michael J. French, it was precisely this unknown territory that drew him to the industry in the first place.
“I foresaw an upcoming intersection of business, law, politics, and all those unique things in a new and undefined way,” French said.
But Michael N. Gold, vice president of Silicon Valley-based satellite corporation Space Systems Loral, said the term “space law” might be misleading.
“I hate the term space law,” he said. “Because there is no space law… 95 percent of our issues are traditional issues, and we’re just applying them into this new and relevant field.” He emphasized people could use existing law that govern people on Earth and apply those laws to space.
As for the future of commercializing space, French said he anticipates that tourism and research is the “next big thing.”
Karen LaFon, a launch engineer at SpaceX, said that international law and policy will play a significant role in the future of space governance.
“When we go to Mars, we need to know what the Outer Space Treaty says and make sure we follow all the regulations in communicating with the government and with other countries,” she said.
The panelists also considered the implications of the upcoming presidential election on space governance.
“We don’t know who’s going to be in this [executive] position. We could ‘make space great again,’ or not. I don’t trust the government,” Gold said.
French, however, was less concerned.
“I think the space program has benefitted from bipartisan support for a long time,” French said. “So I think overall, you’re going to see a fairly stable continuation of what NASA has been doing, which is pushing us out further in the universe to benefit us on Earth.”
Law school students who attended the event said they found the panel interesting.Yanbing Chu had never considered the intersections of law and space before.
“I’m very interested in space-related topics, like physics and astrophysics, but I didn’t think of how it would relate to legal issues,” Chu said.
Sean C. Finan said he thought the talk, which more than 80 students attended, was empowering.
“I’m doing work right now in biotechnology, which is kind of a parallel because it is also an upcoming field with lots to explore,” Finan said. “But I’ve also always been interested in space, and this talk has made me realize it is so much more possible to go to outer space.”

The Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee will begin randomly attending student group events and measuring total attendance, as part of a study commissioned by a new committee policy.
Under the policy, called the “Club Collaboration Research Proposal,” UC representatives will attend anywhere from six to nine events organized by groups that received funding from the Finance Committee. Representatives will count the number of people at the event and compare it to the number of people the group said would attend on their grant application.
“We're doing a study to determine the discrepancy between projected attendance at student events and actual attendance,” Finance Committee Vice Chair of Grants Olu Oisaghie ’19 said when explaining the survey to the full Council on Sunday. “We mainly fund events on a per-capita basis, so we're trying to see if we're efficiently allocating our funding.”
The number of attendees that student groups project will attend their events influences the amount of funding the group receives from the UC. According to the Finance Committee’s policy guide for this academic year, grants for food, transportation, and instructor fees are provided on a per-student basis. However, the Finance Committee currently does not verify that the numbers reported by student organizations are accurate.
The initiative comes in response to analysis Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 conducted last semester. Greenlaw calculated the total number of students projected to attend campus events on any given day for the past five years.
Greenlaw found on one day in 2012 all events together estimated an attendance of more than 25,000. Harvard’s current undergraduate enrollment is about 6,700.
“There are certain points during the year when the cumulative expected number of people who will participate in events exceeds the number of people at Harvard College,” Greenlaw said last spring.
During the first Finance Committee meeting of this academic year, Greenlaw posited two reasons why groups may be overstating event attendance: First, that student groups may intentionally represent attendance; and second, that too many similar student groups hold similar events, and consequently receive fewer attendees each.
Greenlaw and Oisaghie said they believe collaborative events between student groups are more likely to reach their projected attendance numbers than non-collaborative events.
“We're trying to tailor policy so that we can potentially encourage collaboration between clubs to increase event attendance and also get student groups working together,” Oisaghie said.
Already, student groups that collaborate with one another on events are exempt from cuts to funding the Finance Committee makes when they exceed their weekly budget. Greenlaw said that, depending on the results of the survey, the Finance Committee may institute an additional “collaboration bonus” to provide additional funding to student groups who collaborate on events.
Greenlaw emphasized that the research initiative is meant for statistical, rather than punitive, purposes. The policy states that “no student organization shall be penalized for the results of the data gathered [by] the survey.”
“I don’t want people to get the vibe that we’re the secret UC police,” Greenlaw said. “We’re not trying to catch you lying… we’re trying to do a study.”

Despite a strong link between countries in the Americas, there remains little recognition of the close connection between Latin America and the United States, Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation Senior Fellow Peter Quilter argued during a small discussion with students Wednesday night.
In a talk titled “U.S. Policy and the State of Democracy in the Americas,” Quilter addressed current political situations in Latin America and the effects of U.S. involvement in the region.
“[Latin America and the United States] are linked in so many ways, and yet we in the United States don’t behave that way toward the region. We find ourselves considering it a place that’s ‘over there,’” Quilter said in an interview following the event, which was off-the-record.
He also discussed the recent Colombian referendum on whether to end the conflict between the Colombian government and guerilla forces; Colombians voted, by a thin margin, not to approve the peace agreement, thrusting the country into political limbo.
“The referendum in Colombia has driven a lot of attention here in Cambridge,” Daniel Harsha, Ash Center spokesperson, said. “There’s a hunger for students to learn more about that process.”
Quilter, whose family is originally from Argentina, has devoted his career to United States and Latin American relations.
“When I was a kid living in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, I wanted to have some effect on U.S. policy for the region, and I basically made my professional life that,” Quilter said.
Throughout his career, Quilter has held a variety of positions in government. He was secretary for administration and finance at the Organization of American States, senior Democratic staff member of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, and adviser to both the Clinton and Obama administrations.
After giving brief remarks, Quilter opened the event to an informal discussion, which was largely in question and answer format.
“I took away a lot from the talk,” Eric Gao ’20 said. “It was very relaxed and definitely an environment where everyone was free to contribute.”
Quilter said he wanted to spread awareness about the close connection between countries in the Western Hemisphere and provide students insight into his professional experiences.
“I’m not an academic. I try as much as I can in this setting to give a real-world perspective about how these things play in a practical sense, in a policy form, in real discussions where these things are decided,” Quilter said.

Harvard Square feels a little more Mediterranean with the opening of En Boca, an restaurant that specializes in the region’s cuisine.
The restaurant opened its doors at 8 Holyoke St. on Oct. 6. The venue was previously the home of Sandrine’s, a French bistro, until that restaurant closed its doors last March after 18 years in the Square.
Nick Halloran, one of En Boca’s managers, said the restaurant is a “fun” spot for new customers.
“We have interesting food, a great bar program, an excellent wine list, and great music,” Halloran said. “It is a great spot if you want to have something different in Harvard Square.”
Halloran described En Boca as “modern with a touch of classic,” pointing to the restaurant’s minimalist design.
While En Boca’s menu features entrees like lamb meatballs and grilled octopus, the restaurant specializes in small plates that guests can share. The restaurant also features an extensive drink menu and boasts a 17-seat bar.
“We source from the entire Mediterranean. It’s not Spanish, Italian, or Moroccan cuisine—It is a little bit of everything,” Halloran said. “We have a big playground to play in.”
Halloran said the restaurant has been “very busy” since its opening.
“We have been open for two weeks and we are almost twice as busy now as we were during our first week,” he said.
The restaurant is owned by restaurant group Classic Restaurant Concepts, whose Chief Operating Officer Bill Goodwin said he does not foresee the construction of the adjacent Smith Campus Center deterring customers.
“Although during the day there is a lot of construction, it is still very accessible.” Goodwin said.
Goodwin said many Harvard students have frequented the restaurant since its opening and the response has generally been positive.
“Our executive chef has captured the flavors of the Mediterranean and the freshness of his farm-to-table sources,” Goodwin said. “It’s also quite a learning experience as you read on the back of the menu where the plates come from.”
Marcella J. Park ’19 enjoyed En Boca’s selection of small plates.
“There was a nice ambiance,” Park said.  “Small plates meant that I got to try a lot of different dishes.”

Over the past 10 years, the Graduate School of Design’s enrollment has increased by 288 students.
The School of Design, which operates on a leaner budget than many of Harvard schools, has long been one of Harvard’s smallest. In the five years leading up to GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi’s appointment in 2007, the school’s enrollment fluctuated between approximately 540 and 600 students. Under the Mostafavi’s tenure, the population has increased to 895 students.
Landscape Architecture Department Chair Anita Berrizbeitia said this growth has been one of Mostafavi’s biggest initiatives.
“The dean wanted the school to have a bigger voice within the University and contribute to the debates and conversations at the University level. To do that, we needed a bigger student population,” Berrizbeitia said, also adding that Mostafavi also took other measures to increase the school’s presence at Harvard.
GOING BEYOND ARCHITECTURE 
According to GSD faculty, while the architecture program has long been the centerpiece of the GSD, the school’s growth has prioritized scaling up other departments.
While the GSD population as a whole has increased in size, not every master's program has experienced the same level of growth. The architecture program, although still the school’s largest, enrolled three percent more students this academic year than in 2006. According to Director of Student Affairs and Recruitment John J. Aslanian, the relative constancy in growth represents a conscientious effort to achieve more parity across the different departments.
“The general narrative is that, when the dean took over, the School was predominantly architecture, both in the number of faculty and the number of students,” Aslanian said. “To his credit, in order to have a legitimate discourse across the disciplines, you need to have a more even distribution of faculty and students.”
Architecture and Urban Planning student Marcus A. W. Mello said the scaling up of different programs has enabled more collaboration between disciplines.
“I think the more perspectives you can bring here, the stronger the work will be,” Mello said.
The most growth has come in the Masters in Design Studies program, whose enrollment jumped from 41 total students in the 2006-2007 academic year to 171 students this year.
Masters in Design Studies Program Co-Director John May attributes the increase in enrollment numbers with a changing professional landscape.
“The nature of the master’s degree within the design fields has changed over the years,” May said. “There are just a lot more people with master’s degrees than there were 30 years ago.”
May added that he believes a master’s degree has become a prerequisite for an ever-rising number of professional and academic jobs.
Diane Davis, chair of the school’s Urban Planning and Design department, agreed with May, adding that the flexibility of the design studies program in addressing societal needs has generated more interest.
“I think it’s growing because it is offering something different that is aligned more with the questions that people and the methods are using now as compared to 20 to 30 years ago,” Davis said.
The Masters in Urban Planning program has grown in size by 57.8 percent since the 2006-2007 academic year. Meanwhile, the two urban design degrees, the Masters in Architecture in Urban Design and Masters in Landscape Architecture in Design, have also grown by 50 percent during that time span.
“In order to continue to be a leader and create the top planners and designers, we need to keep up with the new ideas and new innovations and technologies and thoughts that are on the field and you do that by bringing new people,” Davis said. She added that the school is smaller than other leading urban planning programs, such as the program at MIT.
In addition to student body growth, the School of Design has also seen growth in its number of researchers.
“There aren’t that many other design schools that have that kind of culture in place. It’s actually pretty rare,” professor of Architectural Technology Martin Bechthold said. According the Harvard University Factbook, the GSD employed six “research and other academic positions,” in the 2006-2007 fiscal year, compared to 29 in the 2014-2015 fiscal year.
GROWING PAINS
While the School of Design has expanded, its faculty and students say that growth has not come without its challenges. 
GSD Director of Facilities Management W. Kevin Cahill said administrators had to convince the school’s faculty, in addition to the University Provost, the Board of Overseers, and the President, that increases in enrollment wouldn’t decrease in the value of a GSD degree.
While May agreed that continual growth could potentially be harmful, he said he believes the School of Design’s current size does not warrant concern.
“I wholeheartedly agree that a university cannot assume perpetual growth without consequence, but I also don’t think that some amount of growth in a program necessarily means a degree has become less valuable,” May said. “It’s a more complicated problem than that.”
According to Aslanian, the admissions rate has also remained steady because of an increase in the number of applications the school receives.
“It’s actually becoming more difficult to come in,” Aslanian said.
Executive Dean Patricia Roberts wrote in an emailed statement that the school’s faculty has added 23 full time equivalents since 2007, meaning that faculty growth has occurred simultaneously with student growth. According to Berrizbeitia, studio classes—the core of many GSD programs—are still capped at 12 students.
However, Berrizbeitia said that lecture classes have increased in size and some seminars have become more difficult to take.
GSD Student Forum President Lane R. Rubin said that, while the School of Design’s central building feels full, classes are still well-sized.
“Studio size has stayed small and I think that is the key. If you’re in lectures of 60 people versus 80 people I don’t think that makes much of a difference,” Rubin said.
Some have still expressed concern about not having a space in the GSD’s primary building, Gund Hall. Davis did say it can be difficult for to find times and spaces for classes and lectures.
“The effect is that space is at a premium and that’s a problem,” she said.
The GSD hopes to add an expansion to Gund with the money raised through the capital campaign. In 2010, the School also acquired three properties on the corner of Kirkland Street and Sumner Road, according to Cahill.
Going forward, Roberts said that school will see more growth as the new Masters in Design Engineering program expands to its planned enrollment. She also did not rule out adding additional Masters of Design track. However, both Roberts and Aslanian believe that future growth will no longer come from architecture, landscape, or urban design.
“Program-wise, while architecture is still the largest, it’s no longer the majority of the School. That’s great. It creates a different dynamic. That’s essentially done,” he said. “The new expansion is the new [engineering] program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may only be the fourth day of Sukkot—a Jewish holiday that celebrates the fall harvest—but it is the 16th day of the Harvard University Dining Services workers’ strike, which presents Harvard Hillel with unique challenges.
The Hillel dining hall, open to all Harvard undergraduates, serves kosher dinners every day and offers bagged lunches to students who order them. During Sukkot, Hillel also offers sit-down lunches so students observing the holiday can eat under a sukkah.
Because of the strike, Hillel does not currently have enough employees who know how to prepare kosher food working in the servery, according Talia Weisberg ’17, the co-president of the Harvard Hillel Orthodox Student Minyan. Instead, Hillel has been ordering food from Catering by Andrew, a local kosher catering company.
According to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga, HUDS management is financing the catering.
“Food at Hillel is typically more costly to produce than that of other dining facilities, and there are some increased costs as a result of the current situation,” deLuzuriaga said.
Students say they have been pleased with the quality of Hillel’s catered food during the strike.
“There’s definitely less of a variety right now than there used to be—but there’s enough food and it’s good quality,” Edyt J. Dickstein ’17, the undergraduate president of Hillel, said.
“The catered food is really good. It seems markedly better than the food in the other dining halls,” Weisberg said.
The costs of the strike have not been solely financial. According to Weisberg, said the HUDS manager, Frank E. Kasprzyk, who oversees Hillel, has been working “insane hours.”
“Because of the holidays he has been staying even later—and we are all very sympathetic. He’s really exhausted. He’s trying to make sure the Hillel dining hall is running as smoothly as possible,” Weisberg said.
Dickstein also said she was disappointed by the changed atmosphere in the dining hall because of the HUDS workers’ absence.
“Because Hillel is a smaller community, everyone who’s very involved knows the dining staff, which adds a personal touch,” Dickstein said.
“The dining hall is very important to those of us who eat all of our meals at Hillel, because it’s the only place where we can eat kosher. We’re very close with the staff—we make them birthday cards every year and they know everyone’s allergies,” Weisberg said.
The strike has also affected Hillel events. “Cheap Eats for Grads,” a program at Hillel that offers dinner to all Harvard graduate students on Wednesdays and Saturdays for $5, was cut, according to Dickstein.
“Honestly, I just miss the Adams and Hillel dining hall communities—they both feel more like cafeterias than dining halls right now,” Dickstein, an Adams resident, said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston City Council unanimously voted to support the Harvard University Dining Services workers’ strike at their meeting on Wednesday in a resolution introduced with an impassioned plea by the Council’s president, an alumna of the College and Law School.
The strike is entering its third week as the “University and the Union continue to meet with mediators,” University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email. The resolution put forth by City Council President Michelle Wu ’07 was met with vocal support by many of her fellow councillors, and loud cheers from a crowd supporting UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston union representing Harvard’s dining workers, often broke out during the meeting. 
Wu spoke about the personal nature of her appeal to the Council and the connections she remembers students fostering with dining hall staff during her time at the College.
“When I arrived at Harvard as a college freshman, it was the first time that I was away from my family for any extended period of time. And the dining hall workers truly become your family away from home,” she said at the meeting. “They are the faces that you see every day, the people who are checking in on you to make sure you are eating well, or are getting enough sleep.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Wu, a former Currier House resident, reflected on moving into Harvard and developing relationships with employees in the dining hall.
“To have a familiar face in the dining halls, in Annenberg and in Currier, kind of become the people you see and get to know and who are the people taking care of you day in and day out,” she said. “As I met with the workers before our Council meeting, spoke to them, it’s clear that they love their jobs. They love taking care of students.”
She said that she was “happy” to speak with workers about their experiences and would be willing to walk with them in support.
“I did so before the City Council meeting,” Wu said. “I was happy to jump in and join the workers in talking about the need for affordable health care, the need for more opportunities to work year-round.”
Several of the city councillors, who added their names in support of the resolution one by one, criticized HUDS employees' salaries; those employees make, on average, are roughly $34,000 per year, according to deLuzuriaga. Local 26 estimates that number is closer to $31,000.
Councillors framed these figures with the size of Harvard’s endowment, which recently fell to $35.7 billion.
“The $35,000 annual salary, average salary, for these workers—that’s one, one-millionth of Harvard’s endowment. One, one-millionth,” City Councillor Josh Zakim said at the meeting. “We are talking about the richest, wealthiest institution, not just in Boston, but in the entire world and they do a lot of good, but they are not doing good today.”
Councillor Tito Jackson was also vocal during the meeting in his criticism of the University’s endowment and recent passage of the capital campaign’s $6.5 billion goal, saying: “Shame on you, Harvard.”
“Instead of studying hard for the test, why don’t you go ahead and actually take the test, and do right by the people who are your workers?” Jackson said during the meeting.
However, deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement that Harvard is constrained in how it can utilize much of the funds. Rules and conditions placed by donors on their gifts stipulate how most funds can be used.
“The funds that make up the endowment and the Harvard Campaign are largely restricted for specific academic purposes,” she wrote, referencing the University’s ongoing capital campaign. “These funds are also only one part of Harvard’s financial picture.”
The City Council’s resolution also noted that the dining workers had received the support of the College’s Undergraduate Council, which voted to endorse the strike in early October.
Former UC leaders also published an op-ed in the Huffington Post on Wednesday, adding their names to the list of strike supporters. The letter was signed by the former presidents and vice presidents of the UC from the Classes of 2011 through 2016.
“As former student body leaders at Harvard, we declare our solidarity with dining staff fighting for dignity in the workplace, a fair wage, and affordable healthcare for their families,” the letter reads. “Today, we urge our alma mater to be good—to support its dining hall workers.”
Across the Charles River from Boston, members of the Cambridge City Council also focused on the size of Harvard’s endowment when they voted to support the potential HUDS strike at a meeting in late September, prior to the strike's beginning.

With Election Day less than three weeks away, students both laughed and gasped while watching Democratic presidential nominee Hillary R. Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump go head to head in the final presidential debate Wednesday night.
Spectators at the Institute of Politics’ third debate watch party burst into laughter after Trump said “we have some bad hombres here,” referring to undocumented immigrants in the United States.The IOP, which held a lottery for tickets to the event, screened the debate in the John F. Kennedy Jr. forum to a large audience, although some seats remained empty.
The Harvard Republican Club, which has refused to endorse Trump, held its own viewing party in the nearby Kennedy School FDR room. Republican Club president Declan P. Garvey ’17 characterized the debate as “disheartening.”
“I mean, I’d like to see Trump pull off a mask and have Jeb Bush emerge and debate Hillary Clinton,” he said.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, campus outreach director for the Harvard College Democrats, said he was pleased with Clinton’s performance. Freeland watched the debate with other club members in Winthrop's dining hall in the Inn at Harvard.
“I think Hillary Clinton won the debate,” he said. “I think Secretary Clinton managed to find the opportunities to show concrete ways, and allow undecided viewers at home to actually see ways in which Trump was presenting inconsistencies, for example in his narrative.”
At the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub, the Freshman Class Committee and the First Year Social Committee joined to organize a watch party for freshmen, replete with french fries and chicken wings.
A packed crowd reacted strongly to Clinton and Trump’s answers to questions on topics ranging from the nomination of a new Supreme Court justice to their fitness to be president. In response to Trump interrupting Clinton with the word “wrong” as she discussed recent allegations of his sexual harassment, a spectator at Queen’s Head shouted “do you not remember?” in disbelief.
The liveliest reactions at Queen’s Head arose after Trump called Clinton a “nasty woman” near the end of the debate. Spectators shook their heads and shouted, “That’s not okay” and “Is this for real?”
Attendee Brianni Lee ’20 said she hoped to see more content-based discussion from the candidates, as opposed to the previous two debates, which largely consisted of personal attacks from both candidates.
“They’re basically proving themselves as the best candidates for the presidency and not really talking about the future of the country,” she said.
With the final debate over, Freeland said the focus should now turn to election day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’ve officially hit the midway point of the 2016 season. From here on out, it’s all Ivy League games, all the time.
On one hand, it’s going to be nice to see some rivalry games soon, especially the most storied rivalry in the entire league: Columbia-Cornell. Wait, you were going to say Harvard-Yale? Fair, but that matchup crosses state lines, and the teams’ names don’t form an alliteration. See? Not as exciting.
On the other hand, it’s a little bit daunting that there are so few Ivy League games left, because I have to write the same number of words, but now there are only four games to write about. So many thoughts to put down into writing, so little time. One small step for man, one giant leap for a certain Crimson sports writer.
Since the season is halfway over, let’s talk about a few “halves.” First and foremost, you only have half a season left of having to read my and my two co-writers’ work. The end is mercifully in sight.
Secondly, is it just me, or does it seem like every Ivy League school’s band is only half a band? I’m not just talking about the number of performers, because that much is easy to see. I’m talking about the quality of the music, too. It’s like they forget to bring half the band’s members, and those forgotten musicians just so happen to be the most talented of the bunch, so  both the choice in what to play, and the performace itself, are less than par. Despite the bands’ collective struggles, they still seem really enthusiastic trying to organize themselves into shapes or words during their halftime shows. Even after half a season, I think Harvard’s band might still be perfecting the “H” formation. You’ll get it next week, guys!
Let’s transition to TV. “The Office” is a staple of any Netflix connoisseur’s lineup, and it has a multitude of Ivy League connections. For those unfamiliar with this masterpiece, Harvard notables B. J. Novak, Mindy Kaling, and Rashida Jones all play key characters. Also, Ed Helms plays Andy Bernard, an eccentric, angry Cornell grad who is obsessed with his alma mater.
How is “The Office” relevant to Ivy League football, you ask? Well, as we were saying about midway points, this show reaches its pinnacle about halfway through its nine seasons. From there on, it is still an elite series, but it is never the same after Michael Scott leaves for Colorado. Was Harvard’s loss to Holy Cross last week a sign of a similar decline to come? Tune in this Saturday to find out for yourself.
Now that I think about it, that whole intro might not have been as witty as I thought it was. But as Bill Belichick would say, “We’re on to the predictions.”
PENN AT YALE
Yale is only 1-2 in home games this year. One possible explanation is that the home crowd is not much of a crowd in the vast wasteland that is the Yale Bowl. Its seating capacity seems to be somewhere in the millions, and attendance is only a few thousand per game. Maybe be a little self-aware when designing your football stadium. Just a thought.
Anyway, mark this down as another home loss for the Bulldogs. Penn, despite a rough start to its 2016 campaign, has picked up the pace recently. The Quakers have won their last three games by a combined 50 points, including a 35-10 drubbing of Columbia last week.
Yale, on the other hand, has lost four out of five to start off. However, the Bulldogs beat Dartmouth, 21-13, so maybe this won’t be a blowout.
Interestingly, both of these teams have lost to Lehigh and Fordham this season.
Prediction: Penn 27, Yale 21
DARTMOUTH AT COLUMBIA
There are some matchups so lopsided that you might as well pick an upset just to have the chance to be in the small minority of those who guessed correctly.
This is not one of those times.
No matter how much I want to go with Columbia here, I just can’t bring myself to do it. Sure, Dartmouth did lose to Yale recently and barelyw escaped with non-conference wins over New Hampshire and Towson, but Columbia is just not going to score enough points to win this game.
Columbia has scored only 61 total points this season, 37 fewer than Brown, which has the second-worst offense in the Ivy League.
Columbia’s defense has excelled in non-conference play, only surrendering a total of 43 points in those three games. However, Princeton tacked on 48 all by itself in a rout, and Penn put up 35 on the Lions last week. Look for Dartmouth to continue the trend of Ivy teams beating up on Columbia.
Prediction: Dartmouth 34, Columbia 17
CORNELL AT BROWN
Cornell has gone in the opposite direction of Penn since a 3-0 start. After a loss to Harvard, the Big Red followed with another defeat, this time at the hands of Sacred Heart.
Brown’s performance this year leaves much to be desired. The Bears have lost four straight games, and last week they only scored seven points at Princeton.
Cornell has been in a slump as of late, but it is still a very balanced team offensively and defensively, and that should be more than enough to handle Brown with ease.
Maybe Andy Bernard’s Cornell a cappella group, Here Comes Treble, could spice up those halftime performances.
Prediction: Cornell 28, Brown 10
HARVARD AT PRINCETON
Harvard is coming off a loss to Holy Cross, and I think everyone is still reeling a bit. This situation reminds me of the Golden State Warriors’ undefeated run at the beginning of the 2015-2016 season. Everyone expected the Warriors to lose a game at some point, but no one thought the Bucks would be the team to end their run.
Trivia question: Which is the only Ancient Eight team with a better point differential than Harvard through five games?
That’s right, Princeton, at plus 63. The Crimson’s defense will have to step up and shut down the Tigers’ potent offensive attack, led by senior quarterback Chad Kanoff, to leave New Jersey with a win on Saturday.
There is a good chance Princeton extends Harvard’s losing streak to two games. However, I feel like it would be considered blasphemy if I picked the Crimson to lose, so I’ll refrain from that.
Prediction: Harvard 35, Princeton 31

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­In a battle that will likely be for the Ivy League crown, field hockey conference leaders Harvard and Princeton will compete Saturday at the Tigers’ Bedford Field.
The No. 20 Crimson (8-4, 4-0 Ivy League) haven’t won the division since 2004, when the team shared it with Penn. The No. 11 Tigers (9-5, 4-0 Ivy League), on the other hand, have taken the division title 21 of the last 22 times, the one exception being 2005.
The game Saturday will showcase the clash of these two strong programs, with Harvard playing the underdog role and both seeking to undermine their Top 12 ranked opponent’s perfect in-conference record.
“Princeton is always one of our biggest rivals and has consistently won the Ivy League championship in the past so this game is really important for us,” captain forward Sarah Finnemore said. “Besides our team, Princeton is the only other team still undefeated in Ivy League play so this game is quite decisive for our performance. Our team is very excited for this game.”
But even though Princeton is strong, Harvard has also been doing particularly well this season, and is in a good position to get a piece of the Ivy crown. The Crimson boasts both a strong goalkeeper in sophomore Libby Manela, and a record breaking forward in senior Marissa Balleza. After playing in two games last year, Manela has become the Crimson’s go-to keeper, splitting time with junior Olivia Startup.
Since her first start against Yale in late September, Manela has been nearly perfect. Harvard is undefeated with her up top. Only three total opposing shots have slipped past the sophomore and the current six game win streak is tied for the longest in the history of the program. A win Saturday against the Tigers will not only mean an upset achieved, but it will also solidify the team’s place in the history books.
Breaking win streaks, while being a feather in the team’s cap, isn’t the only area in which the Crimson is breaking program records—there are individual records being broken. In the team’s last game against Cornell, Balleza netted two points for Harvard en route to a 5-0 victory. In doing so, the senior forward surpassed the school record with 44 career goals and 103 points. With her performance, Balleza also added Co-Ivy League Player of the Week to her assortment of new titles.
“To me, beating the all time goal and points record for the Harvard field hockey program is really a reflection of our team and the whole program,” Balleza said. “Each year I have been here, we have grown and progressed. Every goal or point I have scored has come from the hard work of this whole team.”
On the opposing side, Princeton brings a strong offense in the form of senior Cat Caro, and will be looking to her to negate Balleza’s effect on the field. Last week, Caro racked up two consecutive hat tricks as the Tigers routed both Brown and Towson 5-1 and 8-0 respectively. In fact, it is Caro who shares last week’s Co-Ivy League Player of the Week with Balleza.
“Princeton has a strong attacking unit but our coaches are working on a strong tactical plan to address their offensive threats,” captain midfielder and back Kyla Cordrey said. “I also think our defensive unit has been making some strong stops recently, so I think we will be ready.”
Their offense isn’t the only thing the Tigers bring to the table. In its last game against Towson, Princeton did not allow a single shot on the goal.
As the Crimson prepares, it is clear it will have to start much quicker. It wasn’t until the 28th minute that Harvard finally scored against Cornell, while the Tigers had slipped five shots into the cage in the same amount of time against Towson.
While their records look similar, Princeton holds the advantage. While the Crimson are 2-1 against ranked opponents, the Tigers have lined up against seven ranked opponents and escaped with victories in two of the competitions. In fact, every one of Princeton’s losses comes from a ranked opponent, the lowest being No. 14 Virginia.  Harvard on the other hand, has lost to three unranked opponents.
“We need to just keep playing our own game and have confidence in our game plan,” junior midfielder Hannah Wellington said. “We can’t get psyched out because this is a big game and instead have to trust that each teammate is going to do her own job to be consistent. Then we will come out on top at the end of the 70 minutes.”

Are you frustrated by Harvard’s administration and looking to
make a difference? Are you tired of being ignored? Well, turns out there is a
way to make your voice heard on the most pressing issue on campus today.
Between October 11th and tomorrow, October 21st, the Smith Campus Center is showcasing their furniture options and
asking for feedback. Bonus: they’re giving away pizza and salad! Come one, come
all for some wacky pieces of contemporary design and the golden opportunity to
see grad students — usually yelling at you for breathing in Widener — literally
fall off their chairs. The furniture is organized into categories of outdoors,
lounge, and workspace, but we at Flyby stopped by to better judge the chairs
and sofas with our own superlatives. Now you know which sofa is the bounciest
so you can beeline straight for it when you get there! You’re welcome.
Best to Spin Around On Until You’re Nauseous
Everyone knows office chairs are the real deal when it comes to
the paramount issue of spin. We’re sorry to say that some of these swivel
chairs were straight-up offensive — so low that it physically hurts you
to keep pushing. But this superlative goes to a deserving competitor. Office
chair 2C has leather padding and gleaming metal armrests, so you can feel like
CEO of the world as you whirl yourself to dizziness.
Most Comfortable
Tied for this coveted title are lounge chairs 3C and 4C. Yes, 3C
might look like strange, puffed-up lips in a way that makes you hesitate to
rest your backside in it, but rest assured, it’s worth it. 4C looks like it was
made for you to sink into — just let your whole body melt into those orange
cushions. We’re probably going to petition to replace the standard dorm desk
chairs with these. Imagine not having a permanent backache!
Most Bizarre
Lounge chair 4H is, well, weird. Its backrest extends all the way
up and over your head when you sit in it, which feels a little like there’s
someone standing over you all the time. Sure, it’s snazzy, but we can’t help
but wonder, what’s the point? It’s not like there’s a light fixture built into
the top, or anything… wait, that would be so cool. It’s okay to sit in, we
guess. If you do sit in it, though, you’ll probably be contemplating the
practicality of its design for a long while.
Best for the Stacks
“Sofa” 5A is immediately identifiable by the fact that it does
not at all look like a sofa, and the fact that it has built-in walls. No lie!
We at Flyby think this kind of privacy would be great for a comfortable spot to
curl up in at the libraries in between study sessions. Not that we’re
suggesting you do anything in it but nap and study, but… it has walls. Just
keep that in mind.
Absolute Worst
Unsurprisingly, the beanbag selection reminded us of the
expectations vs reality meme. As in, expectations: comfortable to flop onto,
but reality: will probably make you break a bone if you try to jump onto it.
Beanbag 6H should not have the honor of being called a chair at all, and is
guaranteed to give you spine problems. In addition, trying to get up from this
terrible excuse for seating space is close to impossible. When you finally
manage to roll away from this red mass, you will feel nothing but relief and
the painful loss of your own dignity.
Most Impractical
Damn, Harvard, back at it again with the unrealistic booty
standards! Ottoman 4G is so small that it’s impossible to sit on without losing
balance. It’s cute, sure, but only to look at. It apparently has wheels too,
but that really only adds to its bad design; just try to move anywhere
on it without falling over. We dare you.
Best Overall
It’s hard to combine aesthetics and functionality sometimes, but
this chair goes above and beyond. Lounge chair 6G is more of an experience than
a piece of furniture. It looks like a cross between a drum and a top, and while
you might think it can only rock from side to side, this chair can literally rotate
a full circle with you in it. Hang upside down or gyrate like you’re at the
gym, because this was made for going all-out. We think this chair would be
excellent in any context, whether it’s a fun distraction for fidgety folk or a
great way to stay alive through a boring conversation. Never pull out your
phone again! If you aren’t sold on the free food, please go for a chance
to try this out.
