After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
TOKYO, JAPAN — As one can intuitively guess, a “konbini” is a Japanese convenience store, which is likable to a miniature planet. Inside, shelves are lined with everything from prepackaged meals and orange-infused coffee to men’s underwear and dress shirts.
 For most people, the wonder of such a self-sufficient place dies down within a week at most. Within the pristine glass walls of the konbini, though, I learned how to survive alone in a foreign country. To me, a konbini is equivalent to a humble refuge from confusion and chaos. It’s the checkpoint area on the game map every time I die, sheltering me from time and all matters of reality until I’m ready to face the world again.
Other than some adolescent years spent holed up marathoning anime, I have zero knowledge of Japanese. My first time venturing into the konbini next to my sharehouse consisted of 2o minutes of Google translating various bottles in the toiletry aisle, looking for shampoo. I asked the cashier one of the first phrases I learned before coming to Japan: “Eigo o hanashimasuka?” Do you speak English? The cashier frantically shook his head and instead pointed at various objects until I got the message.
At my second time at the konbini, I decided to try the esteemed prepackaged meals that gave konbinis their fascinating worldly reputation. The cashier asked if I wanted him to heat up the food. Confidently, I shook my head. I knew how to do this much; after all, I had a microwave at home. I then walked home and proceeded to spend the next ten minutes Google translating the Japanese text on my microwave, trying my best to ignore the angry grumbles of my stomach. I realize there is a pattern here.
These first few weeks were a terrifying series of trial and error, but each time I visited the konbini, I came with more confidence and knowledge that I had learned from the previous visit. The konbini became a bubble separate from the rest of Tokyo where I could restart right where I had paused and visibly track my progress of living alone and learning Japanese. At the konbini, I learned how to differentiate Japanese coins, count up to a thousand, and ask for an extra pair of chopsticks. Every exchange with the cashier, however brief, was a sign that I was slowly figuring it out, that I was growing from the timid girl who was too afraid to even visit the konbini on the first day.
In a different sense, I learned how to have confidence in myself and how to take control of a situation. I extended my exchanges with the cashier to conversations with coworkers and strangers, mixing Japanese and English both in language and in perspective. I learned how to get lost and how to find my way back. Living as a foreigner in an unfamiliar environment, I’ve learned not only about who I am as a person but also who I have the potential to be.
Growth starts at a ¥120 tuna mayonnaise onigiri from the local konbini. It starts in a new environment where you must choose between swimming or drowning, despite not knowing how to swim. Some days are better than others, but when it comes to growth, nothing is a step backward. The greatest lesson I learned here in Tokyo is that progress doesn’t necessarily have to be linear to be progress. If I get lost, I know I’ll be okay. There’s a konbini on every block, so I know I’ll always have somewhere to recharge and try again.

Phoenix, Ariz. resident Nicholas Zuckerman was sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of supervised release Wednesday after he threatened to bomb Harvard and shoot attendees of the University’s 2017 black Commencement ceremony.
U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani ’82, who oversaw the sentencing, said the sentence she imposed had to “reflect the seriousness of the offense” and “promote respect for the law.” The sentence fell a few months short of the recommendation made by federal prosecutors, who recommended an 18-month sentence last week.
Zuckerman has already been in custody for over 13 months; federal agents arrested him in June 2018 in connection with the threats. They charged him with two counts of “transmitting threats in interstate and foreign commerce,” and he pleaded guilty to those charges in February.
Zuckerman’s attorney, Cara McNamara, did not respond to a request for comment on the sentencing. Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in a statement that the University appreciates how the case was handled.
“We appreciate the attention of law enforcement in pursuing this matter and their commitment to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of every member of our Harvard community,” Swain wrote.
Zuckerman posted comments with a racial slur on Harvard’s Instagram account in March 2017 threatening violence at the Harvard’s inaugural black Commencement, according to prosecutors. Black Commencement, held annually in May, is an event meant to celebrate black graduates across Harvard’s schools and acknowledge challenges that students of color may face at the University.
“If the blacks only ceremony happens, then I encourage violence and death at it,” Zuckerman wrote in one comment. “I’m thinking two automatics with extendo clips.”
He also wrote “#bombharvard and end their pro-black agenda” on another one of the University’s posts and commented the hashtag on several other accounts’ posts, according to court filings.
Zuckerman, led into the courtroom Wednesday in handcuffs, sat for the nearly two-hour-long sentencing hearing at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in South Boston. During the hearing, the court heard from Assistant U.S. Attorneys Anne Paruti and Scott L. Garland, who argued for a longer sentence, and from McNamara, who called for a shorter one.
Paruti argued that Zuckerman’s threats generated fear among students and that a substantial sentence would be necessary to discourage future hate crimes. McNamara said Zuckerman had struggled with school troubles, unemployment, and mental health issues; she argued that he would benefit more from counseling and anger management programs.
After the lawyers delivered their arguments, Zuckerman himself addressed the court. He delivered a tearful apology and said he regrets posting the threats.
“I want to apologize to anyone who was hurt or scared by what I wrote,” Zuckerman said. “I’m disgusted by what I said.”
“I’ll never make these mistakes again,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling reiterated the government’s commitment to prosecuting similar threats in a press release his office issued Wednesday.
“We will investigate all threats that cross the line of free speech and infringe on the safety and security of members of our community, especially when those threats are based on race or other immutable characteristics,” Lelling wrote.
Joseph R. Bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the FBI Boston Division, wrote in the same press release that he hopes the sentence will help deter hate crimes.
“Let today’s sentence serve as a lesson to all that no hate monger hiding behind a social-media pseudonym can stop others from celebrating the diversity of some of our area’s best and brightest minds,” Bonavolonta wrote.
Talwani also imposed several restrictions for Zuckerman during his period of supervised release, including monitoring of his internet and social media usage.

The Harvard University Police Department is investigating an email containing a litany of racist and antisemitic statements that was sent to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and multiple College students Monday.
The email, which was addressed to Bacow, was sent from an account under the name ‘Jamal West’ set up through Hushmail, a Canadian encrypted email service. It called on the College to reverse its decision to rescind its admission of Parkland shooting survivor and gun rights activist Kyle Kashuv over racist comments he made in high school.
The sender made multiple racist statements and used slurs against African-American, Chinese, and Jewish people in the email. Several of the College’s Diversity Peer Educators, at least one other College student, and at least one College alumnus received the email.
College administrators alerted HUPD to the message Monday, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane. HUPD spokesperson Steven Catalano confirmed in an email that police had been alerted to the email and that the incident is currently under investigation.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that the University is “committed to ensuring an environment where every individual has the opportunity to thrive.”
“Harvard is strengthened by the rich diversity of individuals, ideas and ideals that make up our community,” he wrote. “However, speech that attempts to marginalize people based on their identities is beneath contempt.”

UPDATED: July 19, 2019 at 1:32 p.m.
Institute of Politics Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan will serve as interim faculty deans of Winthrop House through the upcoming school year, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in an email to Winthrop residents Friday.
Khurana’s email comes several weeks after former Winthrop Faculty Deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson moved out of their Mill Street residence, and two months after Khurana announced he would not renew them following student protests.
Over the course of the spring semester, Sullivan faced scrutiny over his representation of Harvey Weinstein and his subsequent response to students’ concerns. Sullivan served on Weinstein’s legal team for several months as the Hollywood producer faces charges for crimes including rape. Sullivan stepped down as Weinstein’s lawyer in May, citing conflicts with his teaching schedule.
Undergraduates organized a sit-in calling on the College to remove Sullivan and Robinson less than a week before Khurana announced the change. Nearly 200 students attended the event, filling the Winthrop dining hall with red and black signs. At the sit-in and in previous protests, students argued Sullivan’s representation rendered him incapable of dealing with issues surrounding sexual assault in Winthrop.
Separately, The Crimson reported in May that Sullivan and Robinson faced allegations brought by Winthrop students, tutors, and staff that the pair fostered a toxic culture over the course of their decade-long tenure.
Khurana’s announced the decision to not renew Sullivan and Robinson’s contracts in a May 11 email to Winthrop residents, citing an “untenable” environment in the House.
Shortly after Khurana’s announcement, Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan wrote in an email to Winthrop residents Friday that they are “honored” to have been selected as interim faculty deans and that they have longstanding ties to the House. Gearan was a Winthrop resident during his time at the College, as was the pair’s daughter, who graduated in 2015.
“We have returned over the years as a family during Reunions observing the physical changes and always admiring the continual pride students have in this House,” they wrote. “It is that sense of pride and community that draws us to this interim role and our hope to get to know all of you – to listen and to learn – and collectively work to support your academic and social experiences, in the year ahead.”
Khurana wrote in his email that he is “delighted” for the pair to take their interim post in Winthrop.
“Mark and Mary are devoted Harvard community members and are well prepared to ensure that your house feels like a home where you can bring together your academic, social, and personal passions and pursuits,” Khurana wrote.
Both the interim deans’ and Khurana’s emails did not mention the controversy surrounding Sullivan and Robinson.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane said Friday that the interim faculty deans would stay on at Winthrop for the full year in order to allow for student participation in the search for a permanent replacement. Undergraduates typically advise Khurana alongside tutors and staff when he taps new faculty deans.
Khurana wrote in his email that the search for Winthop's permanent faculty deans will begin in the fall and that undergraduates will be given “various opportunities” to meet candidates for the position during the search process.
Before taking his post at the Institute of Politics, Geran served as the president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges for more than a decade until 2017. In 2017, Gearan held a year-long appointment as the president-in-residence of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. Herlihy-Gearan has previously worked as a congressional staffer, community organizer, and lobbyist.
Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan wrote that they plan to move into Winthrop in August.
