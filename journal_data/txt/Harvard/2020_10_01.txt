After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Steve McQueen's hypnotic "Lovers Rock," the scintillating film that opened this year’s New York Film Festival, "Mangrove" feels somewhat disappointing. Both “Lovers Rock” and “Mangrove” are part of McQueen’s anthology “Small Axe,” five standalone films that represent the West Indian experience in Britain from the 1960s to the 1980s. While McQueen tells an ambitious and timely story, “Mangrove” doesn’t serve dramatic justice to its incendiary subject matter. It’s an entertaining courtroom drama, but it’s also paint-by-numbers in a way that doesn’t lend the emotional heft one would expect from such an important (yet surprisingly unrepresented) slice of history.
“Mangrove” is the story of the Mangrove Nine, a group of Black British activists who were tried for instigating a riot while protesting police brutality. The Mangrove was a Black-owned restaurant in Notting Hill, London that served West Indian cuisine and quickly became a beloved institution in the neighborhood’s Black community. Because of this, the Mangrove became the subject of repeated, baseless, and racially-sparked police raids that helped galvanize the Black Panther movement in Britain. McQueen’s cast headlines Letitia Wright (“Black Panther”) as activist Althea Jones-Lecointe and Shaun Parkes as Mangrove owner Frank Crichlow.
Crichlow is framed as a reluctant hero not on the same page as the other activists. This provides a second dimension of conflict in the courtroom scenes: The activists not only need to fend against the court but also need to fight to stay unified. Unfortunately, Circhlow’s riveting character arc is often undermined by an uneven screenplay penned by McQueen and Alastair Siddons (of the "Tomb Raider" reboot). In one of the film’s most important scenes, Crichlow sits down with an activist who tries to convince him to hold a political demonstration in front of the Mangrove. Crichlow lists his concerns, chiefly, that the police would close down his establishment. He represents the initial hesitance that millions face before participating in civil unrest, and is motivated first and foremost to own a “respectful restaurant... not a battleground.” But in this scene, Crichlow finds his back against the wall — he realizes that the peaceful existence he covets is impossible because of systemic injustices. But going from that realization to agreeing to hold a rally — an important decision for Crichlow — is reduced to a single moral platitude. The activist tells him “a demonstration is the right thing to do.” Well, if only others had only told Crichlow it was the “right thing” too — he would have taken on their cause much earlier!
It’s these occasional bursts of implausible writing that cripple “Mangrove” in its most potent moments. Arguments blow up before dissipating into thin air, and some characters carry the same fever-pitched anger from start to end. This creates a breathless tone that lends itself well to fast pacing and entertainment value, but also leaves “Mangrove” feeling occasionally tedious and unbalanced. McQueen tries to account for this imbalance by including some levity, with characters bursting into song over a dinner table or dancing outdoors. But these scenes are too few and far between to feel like natural inclusions.
Perhaps the most striking shot in the film is one where “Mangrove” stops to take one of its only breaths. It takes place in the aftermath of a violent police raid, where they had used batons to wreak havoc in the Mangrove’s kitchen. A stationary camera on the ground lingers on a shot of a bowl rolling around, in silence, long after the cooks run away and the police leave. It’s a harrowing reminder of the lasting damage that has done, damage that audiences are finally given time to internalize.
After breakneck pacing in the first act, “Mangrove” finds more even footing in its second act as an intelligent and tense, if conventional, courtroom drama. Here, McQueen addresses the systematic nature of racial oppression. The Mangrove can never succeed as a business institution because it is constantly being raided by the police. It’s not just the broken equipment and dishes that set back operations — customers won’t return to an establishment where they could be arrested for a crime as heinous as eating.
The legal system is also tilted against the activists, but they try to find creative ways to navigate it. The Mangrove Nine made arguments in court for an unprecedented all-Black jury, and also represented themselves legally so that they could cross-examine witnesses. One of McQueen’s arguments seems to be that one cannot rely on white institutions to solve themselves. It is impossible to complain to the police about white policemen, because all policemen are white. It is equally impossible to say to a white judge that white policemen systematically target Black communities, because they all beget the same oppressive system.
“Mangrove” features powerful performances from a talented ensemble of actors, and even more powerful themes. However, McQueen’s latest is not a powerful film. It stumbles occasionally with uneven pacing and unconvincing dialogue that undermine an otherwise taut courtroom drama, one that had the potential to be a politically explosive film.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Nomadland,” writer-director-editor Chloé Zhao paints a riveting character study of a woman who leaves her job at an Amazon packing plant to live out of her van as a nomad in the American West. In just her third film, Zhao tackles bold themes as she delivers a visually stunning and carefully written film that illuminates the lives disenfranchised by a society which too often prioritizes capitalistic wealth over human wellbeing.
Zhao's film is reminiscent of Kelly Reichardt’s “Wendy and Lucy” — both films feature a woman forgotten by corporate America struggling to find belonging. But in “Nomadland,” Fern (Frances McDormand) is given multiple opportunities to live with mainstream society. Zhao makes it a point to highlight this throughout the film — be it through friends who seek her whereabouts, a sister who offers her an abode, or a lover who offers to settle down with her. Fern isn’t only left out by a society that has forced her to work so long for so little. She has rejected it.
Early in the film, a child asks Fern if she is homeless. Fern smiles and responds, “No, I’m not homeless. I’m just houseless. Not the same thing, is it?”
For Fern, home is not a physical location — it's life in the plains, on the road, as a nomad. Even if this way of life is removed from society’s common pleasures, like cinemas or restaurants, it gives her a sense of belonging that the middle-class suburban dream simply can’t offer. It’s not for a lack of reaching out that Fern feels disenfranchised: It’s the snide contempt that hides behind the weak smiles of the comfortable Chardonnay-sipping suburban class. It’s a concept that Zhao spoon-feeds to the audience; perhaps she thought it would be a difficult one to grasp, or perhaps it only appears obvious in hindsight because of the effectiveness of Zhao's visual storytelling.
With cinematographer Joshua James Richards behind the camera, the outdoors are filmed with breathtaking wide-angle landscape shots, with the camera sometimes tracking around Fern to reveal a sunrise just as it bursts over a mountain range. Suburbia lacks all sense of that dynamism and mystique; Richards drains the color out of those scenes, making them feel comparatively mundane and depersonalizing. While the wide shots of the great plains are visually striking, those same wide-angles in an empty house feel lonely and uncomfortable. In “Nomadland,” it’s more than understandable why Fern would choose life as a nomad.
Opposite two-time Academy Award winning actress and perpetual Coen brothers favorite Frances McDormand is David Strathairn, who won Best Actor in George Clooney’s “Good Night, And Good Luck.” McDormand delivers a powerful performance; it’s not the showiest, relying on a subdued energy to capture the range of subtleties in the human experience, from loneliness to relief from mere companionship. What’s remarkable is that Zhao decided to fill the rest of the cast with real nomads. It lends a candor and earnest understanding to this way of life that makes “Nomadland” feel refreshingly honest.
Some films about society’s outsiders merely depict them on screen: They point at their existence from the inside of society looking out. Todd Phillips’ “Joker” is a perfect example of this problem. It points to the existence of outsiders in society, and then proceeds to make the groundbreaking, earth-shattering epiphany that those outsiders are treated unfairly. Eureka! What remarkable insight into the human condition! “Joker” was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards.
This can also be applied to many Hollywood-produced films about minority communities. “Crazy Rich Asians,” directed by Jon Chu, carried the enormous responsibility of being the first Hollywood film with a majority-Asian cast. However, the film doesn’t say much at all about Asian life or culture. In fact, it celebrates the very demographic of people in South East Asia responsible for corrupting governments and sparking egregious inequality in the region. It’s sickening that such a hollow, insipid film was meant to stand for anything. “Crazy Rich Asians” is a symptom of that same Hollywood trend that produced “Joker”: It’s like Chu pointed off in the distance and notified the world of the existence of Asians. Congratulations.
In contrast, “Nomadland” is so special because it breaks the blind pandering and virtue-signaling that is so frustrating in corporate Hollywood. And because it treats its subject matter with such respect and patience, it actually has the chance to win over casual viewers — from the attention and nuance put into Fern's character to a non-professional, authentic cast of real nomads.
However, if Zhao’s goal was to appeal to that casual demographic, she might run into a pacing conundrum. Time does not run uniformly in “Nomadland,” and Zhao often skips months at a time in a quick montage as Fern jumps from one job to another. It creates the effect that jobs in this economy are just a part of society’s capitalist machinations, and participating in such a system makes one feel like a replaceable cog. However, the nonlinear depiction of time can also be frustrating for some audiences; it creates the effect of a sometimes static film that dwells too long on the minutia of details and not on a broader, conventional story. But while Fern’s character doesn’t discernibly change from the film’s start to its end, our understanding of her does. Zhao’s quest for audiences to understand the motivations and inner workings of a character removed from society's concepts of success are a frank success in storytelling.
It’s ironic, perhaps, that Zhao’s next film is one in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — the epitome of the capital-churning machine that is Hollywood. Perhaps Zhao’s Marvel detour is more a testament to her immense talent as a storyteller — that she is able to deliver on such a diverse range of projects. But regardless of whether it’s a future in big-budget filmmaking or more films like “Nomadland,” it’s tantalizing to imagine what could be in store in Zhao’s future.

The game is afoot!
Stories about the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes have been told for over a century. “Enola Holmes” delightfully reorients the narrative around Sherlock’s younger sister, Enola. This Netflix original movie is adapted from Nancy Springer’s young adult novel “An Enola Holmes Mystery: The Case of the Missing Marquess.” Director Harry Bradbeer’s adaptation is entertaining, thoughtful, and has a powerful cast, but rarely touches on themes that warrant further exploration.
The story follows the titular Enola (Millie Bobby Brown, who is also credited as a producer), a confident and independent young woman who lives in a world where girls are supposed to learn how to embroider and stand up straight — exactly the opposite of how Enola’s mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter) raised her. When Eudoria disappears on Enola’s 16th birthday, leaving only a smattering of clues behind, Enola goes looking for her mother while avoiding her meddlesome siblings: the famous detective Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and the cantankerous politician Mycroft (Sam Claflin). Along the way, she helps out a young runaway lord called Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge). Mysteries grow and intertwine as pieces of the puzzle gradually fall into place around this unique cast of characters.
One distinct quality of the film is that Enola breaks the fourth wall to tell much of her story directly to the camera, often by looking right into it to describe her thought process as she deciphers clues, or by giving the audience a knowing look (almost reminiscent of “The Office”). This serves as a very effective tool for exposition, and helps viewers get to know and understand the intrepid young sleuth. Audiences get to share her emotions, from excitement to exasperation. The use of cute title cards and animations between sections also contributes to the lighthearted and fast paced quality of the feature.
Enola’s relationship with her mother is the centerpiece of the movie, and editor Adam Bosman masterfully intercuts flashbacks throughout the story to show the influence of that relationship on Enola. Particularly impressive is a fight scene set in a dark London street that is smoothly cut together with flashbacks of Enola at various ages practicing physical combat with her mother in a sunny English field. The movie also effectively uses classic mystery editing techniques, such as flashbacks to moments where clues were spotted.
Millie Bobby Brown plays a wonderful protagonist — Enola is not quite as iconic as Brown’s Eleven (“Stranger Things”), but here she is a charming and endearing character to root for. One of the great things about Brown is that she exudes her enjoyment of the role — she’s having a great time, and it shows.
Enola is a strong character, and she doesn’t rely on her association with Sherlock to resonate with audiences. It is worth noting that Sherlock is perhaps more successful in “Enola Holmes” as a secondary character than as a protagonist in other films. He maintains a special aura of mystery when he isn’t being explored as the center of the plot. Henry Cavill has joined the ranks of many talented actors (including fellow superheroes Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch) to portray the famous detective, and he brings his own flair to the classic character. His rendition of Sherlock is suave and collected, even somewhat aloof, as opposed to the more eccentric characterizations typically seen on screen. When watching Cavill, one can see the wheels turning inside his head, and believe in the complexity of his intriguing persona — a scene-stealer, to be sure.
At its heart, “Enola Holmes” is a coming-of-age story, empowering viewers to believe that they too can forge their own path in the future. However, the film does touch on some more complicated themes. Set against the backdrop of a progressive voting reform bill, there are a multitude of political questions in the air. In a fantastic exchange with Sherlock, a character named Edith (Susie Wokoma) challenges him: “Politics doesn’t interest you. Why? Because you have no interest in changing a world that suits you so well.” There is also the relevant question of how to best create political change. Is violent protest justified? Should one operate entirely within the system to achieve justice? These are ideas the film alludes to, but disappointingly never expands upon. In the current sociopolitical moment, it is difficult to see these issues pushed to the side.
“Enola Holmes” isn’t perfect: some plot elements are a little ambiguous, and it is occasionally a little exaggerated (“Oh good God,” exclaims Mycroft with disdain. “Feminism!”). But despite whatever flaws it may have, it’s an engaging watch, with strong characters, genuine suspense, and an abundance of heart. The film’s ending leaves the door open for a sequel, and Nancy Springer’s novels provide plenty more source material. Another adventure in the world of Enola Holmes would be more than welcome.
“Enola Holmes” is available to stream on Netflix now. You can watch the trailer here.

“Glee,” a bizarre, hallowed relic of a high school television show, arguably had two true stars: Amber Riley and Naya Rivera. Rivera’s inimitable Santana Lopez was the emotional center of the series, forging a new model of queer Afro-Latina representation onscreen and making a striking mark on young Hollywood.
Rivera, who passed away in July at 33, was born in Valencia, Calif., where she began her journey as an actress at age four playing roles in “The Royal Family” and “Family Matters.” In this era of thriving Black sitcoms, she also had smaller roles in “Soul Food” and “The Bernie Mac Show,” where she played humorous and adorable children.
On “Glee,” in which Rivera appeared from 2009 to 2015, the young actress made an indelible mark. She gave some of the show’s most lauded performances (see her all-cello rendition of “Smooth Criminal” and ravishing cover of Amy Winehouse’s“Valerie”), provided some of the most intense clapbacks and dramatic monologues in an intensely melodramatic show, and was a pioneer for Afro-Latina characterization. Santana’s story allowed fans at home to see their queerness reflected on-screen while also offering a new model for Afro-Latinas that pushed beyond racist stereotypes. Rivera’s gift was her ability to anchor Santana Lopez in vulnerability and a slick, lovable attitude — she skillfully articulated a seasons-long lesbian love story in a grounded, electric performance. Rivera proved that one could not only assert Afro-Latina queer identity onscreen, but relish in it and build community around it, crafting an epic arc of commitment, persistence, talent, and trust across six seasons.
After “Glee” ended, Rivera appeared in Lifetime’s “Devious Maids” as Blanca Alvarez, and her final TV role was as the charismatic teacher Collette Jones in “Step Up: High Water” for two seasons on YouTube. Netflix released her final TV appearance (“Sugar Rush”) posthumously in July.
Throughout her career, Rivera contributed to social justice causes, dedicating her time to charitable work within the Black Lives Matter, undocumented rights, and LGBTQIA+ rights movements. In 2016, she published her memoir, “Sorry Not Sorry,” in which she told the story of her career and her relationships in Hollywood, ensuring that her impact and her life’s journey were enshrined in her own voice.
In Santana’s now-iconic coming-out episode on “Glee,” she remarks about her eventual girlfriend, Brittany: “I finally understand what people are talking about when they talk about love.” Revisiting Rivera’s decades-long career, it’s hard not to feel the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, when protests against systemic racism and police brutality erupted worldwide, Harvard vowed to be an ally in the fight for change. Frustrated by those “willfully blind” to racism’s hold in this country, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay and other administrators spoke of “a new sense of institutional responsibility” wherein “anti-racist action” would infuse Harvard’s teaching and research.
Now, barely a month into the academic calendar, the University can prove the sincerity of its rhetoric — or, in failing to do so, reveal its emptiness.
Government Preceptor David D. Kane is facing allegations that he authored a number of racist blog posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” on a site he created in 2003 called EphBlog. The site, which has been in “ maintenance mode” since allegations surfaced, has published blog posts authored by “Field” that contain racist content. One post states that fewer than one in 10 Black students at Williams College would have earned admission if it weren’t for their race. Another argues that there there should be a place at Williams for Identity Evropa: an American neo-Nazi and white supremacist group whose leader openly avocates for the “Nazification of America.” Identity Evropa is perhaps best known for its role in organizing the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. and for coining the white supremacist rallying cry “You will not replace us.” Another inappropriate post, entitled “Willy E. N-word Super Penis,” proposes this title as the new name for Williams College’s official mascot.
The allegations against Kane are disturbingly convincing. One post filed under the author tag “David Field Dudley” was signed off “David Kane ’88” (Kane is a 1988 graduate of Williams College). David Kane is also listed as a contributor to the blog, though no posts appear to be filed under his name. Damning still, in his response to the controversy, Kane has repeatedly failed to claim that he did not author the posts in question, or to condemn their content despite issuing multiple statements on the subject to students enrolled in his course.
The posts are unacceptable. Our issue with them goes beyond mere differences in political opinion — there are plenty of professors on campus whose political views we find horrific. But, if the allegations that the posts authored by “Field” were written by Kane are true, the suggestion that 90 percent of Black students at Williams don’t belong there and the defense of literal Nazism have irreparably damaged Kane’s ability to serve as an instructor.
Harvard cannot allow Kane to continue teaching Government 50, as he intends to resume lecturing October 13 after a temporary hiatus, according to an email he sent to the class. He simply cannot serve as an effective preceptor — certainly not to the Black students whose belonging at higher education institutions (and evidently in this country) he allegedly challenges, but also not to anyone with a basic intolerance for bigotry. In short, David Kane, assuming the allegations are true, must be fired.
Rather than forcing students to flee from a course into which they’ve already invested significant time — an option the Government Department has offered while chastising teaching fellows for proposing a boycott of lectures — Harvard should remove Kane.
The posts’ content have the potential to harm the sense of belonging felt by Black students at the College. They prey on impostor syndrome and other mental health struggles linked to the pervasiveness of systemic racism — which have been shown to negatively impact student academic performance. They follow the same twisted reasoning that aims to dismantle affirmative action, perpetuating vicious tropes that seek to present Black students as somehow less deserving than their peers.
We call on white students in the class to consider the undue burden this situation places on Black students and how remaining passively silent perpetuates racism and forges an insidious “white solidarity.” If Kane continues as the course instructor, white students should leave in protest.
If firing Kane is not immediately possible, he must be placed on full leave while the Government Department swiftly completes its current review. That includes his other Harvard duties — including acting as an adviser for the government data science track. How could students of color possibly navigate an advising appointment with an instructor they know questions their very place in college?
Until October 13, Gov 50 will be taught by the course’s teaching fellows, leaving the University with two practical options: first, to use that time to find a valid replacement head instructor; or second, to create conditions in which graduate students can successfully lead the rest of the course without chastisement for their pedagogical choices. In either case, graduate students, who have stepped up, deserve appropriate compensation for their additional labor.
Students shouldn’t be thrown into chaos just because University administrators failed to perform some very basic vetting in 2018. After all, if students can so easily find these blog posts, why didn’t Harvard?
Harvard administrators promised, for months, that they could — and would — do better. They said they understood the destructive nature of racism; that they were equally outraged and disheartened by the malicious character of significant chunks of American society.
The time is now to demonstrate that they meant it.

The storied friendship of the late Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin G. Scalia is heartwarming: a persevering mutual admiration despite fierce ideological differences, yearly New Year’s dinners, trips to the opera, even elephant rides.
“Best buddies,” as Ginsburg put it.
Or as Scalia once said of Ginsburg, “What's not to like — except her views on the law.”
Recently, some have been referencing this curious relationship as a model to solve political polarization. And in our era of polarization, it sounds hopeful that a liberal icon and conservative stalwart could work together. Catalyzed by each other’s wit and fight, both Ginsburg and Scalia both wrote brilliant majority and minority opinions. As the son of the late Justice Scalia said, both justices believed their debate — “arriving at their own opinions thoughtfully and advancing them vigorously — was essential to the national good.”
So why are such bipartisan relationships the exception in a seemingly widening divide? Some attribute partisan politicization to increased issue-based homogeneity within political parties. In the mid-20th century, conflict tended to divide parties, which made them appear more heterogeneous. Immigration, for example, used to be somewhat muddied across party lines, but now sharply distinguishes liberal and conservative platforms.
As demographic characteristics (such as race, gender, or religion) increasingly determine party affiliation, others point to social identity theory, which posits that membership in a group will heighten positive views of that group as well as negative views of other groups. Additionally, members gradually change their ideas to better fit the group’s, creating a positive feedback loop.
Which leads us back to Justices Ginsburg and Scalia. They did not engage in personal attacks, but each also failed to persuade the other. So did they decrease polarization? Or did they increase it?
Whether it came to same-sex marriage or healthcare, no matter how good-natured the argument, the two justices’ opinions could not have been further apart. In the 1996 United States v. Virginia case, for example, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion that the Virginia Military Institute’s male-only admissions policy violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. She wrote that the proposed creation of an analogous Virginia Women’s Institute for Leadership at a nearby private women’s college would not provide the training or network of benefits equal to what the prestigious public VMI offered, and the decision struck down laws that “den[y] to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature — equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society.” Scalia, who wrote the only dissent, called the decision “politics-smuggled-into-law,” claiming it “sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores the history of our people.”
Each would not concede. Their friendship likely had no impact on their respective conclusions and might have even strengthened the extent of their disagreement. Ginsburg later said her own “opinion is ever so much better because of [Scalia’s] stinging dissent.” Can discussion that intensifies partisan differences really advance the national good?
This tale of two justices displays a fundamental paradox between compromise and conviction. On the one hand, compromise is necessary to bridge different parties. All human ideologies occur on a spectrum — from more conservative to more liberal and everything in between — so you have to negotiate to achieve any change.
On the other hand, some principles are non-negotiable. While compromise has long been considered the art of politics and a necessity in getting stuff done in a democracy, an insistence on fundamental human values has crucially characterized our greatest leaders. You can’t compromise on the environment while the West Coast is burning. You can’t allow selective voter suppression that dehumanizes certain citizens.
Likewise, the answer to polarization cannot simply be neutrality. Coming to an arbitrary middle point might really just be bystanding. "If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor,” Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu said. “If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality." Sometimes, coming to agreement may even be harmful, as alliances can end in mutual suppression such as the bipartisan anticommunist fervor that enabled Senator Joseph McCarthy to blacklist dissidents.
So where does that leave us? Must we sometimes allow a step back in order to take two forward? If we meet in the middle, is progress made? Or should we hold the line until we by fortune or strategy win the day?
The friendship between Justices Ginsburg and Scalia is both a case study and an open puzzle. I don’t know how we prioritize principles and prevent potential national fracturing, or how we evaluate the benefits of different types of engagement. But, right now, as we witness increased politicization from the presidential debate stage to the Supreme Court bench, I look to the two justices as a source of hope. At the very least, their story demonstrates that our political decisions are best informed by humanity towards each other — and perhaps, once in a while, a shared elephant ride.

For those who aren’t familiar with Charles Murray, first off — congratulations. Secondly, you should know that his book “The Bell Curve” claims that racial genetic differences cause lower IQ scores among Black individuals. And so you can imagine that just a week ago when I heard he was invited to campus, the thought that crossed my mind was — “Who in the world was giving Charles Murray a platform to spread his racism?” Recent events regarding Gov 50’s David Kane, remind me and you that, unfortunately, supporters of Charles Murray’s “science” are not outside our circles.
I still remember my first encounter with a Charles Murray-ist. It was 2017, a few months after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. I had heard that a quieter friend from my English class claimed that, due to evolution, white people were the superior race. The notion that a friend of mine thought that Black people were inherently inferior to white people felt like something out of the Old South.
So, one day after class I asked this friend about Charles Murray, hoping that I could shed some light on the obvious wrongness of Charles Murray’s “science” and stamp out my friend’s racist ideas. My effort was to no avail. Since then, I cannot tell you the number of conversations I’ve had along a similar vein, where a friend or family member defended something as right or true that I believed to be universally accepted as wrong and undeniably false. The feeling of disgust, despair, and dissonance with all I know to be true is far from foreign now.
In a discussion, whether it be about Charles Murray or Donald Trump or Milo Yiannopoulos, whether it be about police brutality, immigration, the #MeToo movement, or honestly any way Donald Trump handles anything (except for the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg — I’m still puzzling through his surprisingly appropriate and respectful comments after her passing), any disagreement feels void of logic and compassion.
The other side is unwilling to acknowledge injustice, history, or hypocrisy. They are unable to concede simple points like “all people are created equal” or “police officers shouldn’t take innocent lives.” Just look at how Donald Trump refused to denounce white supremacy.
Having these kinds of conversations is exhausting. Having conversations where you discuss a political issue (that shouldn’t be political) where all opinions must be respected (no matter how harmful) is painful, and frankly, feels wrong. Especially when people claim that white people are the superior race, or that immigrant children “aren’t my problem,” that “all Muslims are terrorists,” or that sexual assault and rape aren’t a big deal.
I’ve heard all these statements with my own ears. It is particularly painful when I hear it from the mouths of those I love. These people, I see the goodness in them. I see them as loving and kind. They’re my family, they’re the people who sat across the aisle from me at church, they’re my friends. I watch them care for others in their day to day; they would never bully, assault, shoot, or starve anyone. And yet when it’s about the way their country is run, something shifts which I don’t understand, and this dissonance hurts too. No wonder I’m a bleeding-heart liberal. In every conversation I have with you, you stamp on my heart.
It is exhausting and heartbreaking to have to explain to someone why they should care about the well-being of other people. It’s exhausting to have to explain to someone why even my rights should be respected, and I am a cis-gender white female. Exhausting to explain why you should even care.
It is exhausting, because, when I speak with those who, maybe unknowingly, subscribe to ideas of hate, harm, and lies, it feels as if respect for others, protection of all people, alleviation of suffering within our control, and compassion are all political statements. That these things are negotiable, that I must persuade you to care about basic human rights.
Reading the news is also painful. Because what makes me lose all hope isn’t only what is happening, but that there are millions of my fellow Americans who condone it.
So, speaking to Charles Murray fans, no, I don’t want to hear why you like Charles Murray. I really don’t. I don’t want to listen to you justify injustice or dismiss destruction. I think I speak for a lot of people when I say we’ve heard enough.
But, I hate to say it, I think I have to listen. Because I am guessing you — the Charles Murray-ist — felt wildly misunderstood reading this article. And maybe, you think my assessment of your values and beliefs is unfair.
Not communicating and not listening to each other isn’t what’s going to change your mind. My giving up on you isn’t what is going to heal the ideologies of this country. No, I don’t want to hear why you like Charles Murray, but I suppose I have to.

An international team of climate researchers and scientists affiliated with institutions like Harvard, the University of Maine, and the University of Nottingham have uncovered evidence of a six-year European climate anomaly, which impacted World War I and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.
Data obtained from historical records and an ice core, published with the Sept. 15 study, suggests that the presence of cold, salty air over Europe exacerbated casualties of the influenza pandemic and WWI.
Researchers in partnership with the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine and the Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard study historical and natural data for evidence of climate anomalies. Glaciers and ice cores offer time capsules of global climate history, according to Alexander F. More, a co-author of the study and research associate in the Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard.
“Just like you smell it in your nose, the glacier smells it too,” More said. “The glacier traps whatever’s in the atmosphere — whether that’s human pollution, or dust from the Sahara, or salt from the ocean.”
The team uses new laser ablation technology from the University of Maine and a melting process called continuous flow analysis to date climate patterns observed in ice cores. The team’s recent discovery of high sodium and chlorine concentrations in the Colle Gnifetti glacier in the Swiss-Italian Alps indicated the presence of sea salt deposited in the early 20th century. According to More, this salt buildup demonstrated an extreme climate event.
“For the period of World War I, we saw the largest increase in sea salt in 100 years,” More said. “We looked into the historical accounts of World War I provided by my colleague Christopher P. Loveluck at the University of Nottingham and now had a much clearer picture of what was happening. It was a six-year anomaly where this cold, wet air from the North Atlantic really lingered over Europe.”
More and his colleagues discovered that the climate extreme was the result of a dominant marine air system, which forced cold marine air from the North Atlantic down onto Europe from 1914 until 1919. When the team compared this data with historical records, spikes in cold air matched spikes in mortality rates across Europe during WWI and the 1918 pandemic. The cold air damaged harvests, which had deadly consequences during the war and subsequent pandemic, according to History professor Michael McCormick, chair of the Initiative for the Science of the Human Past.
“Bad harvests promote frailty of health,” McCormick said. “One of the winters was called the ‘Turnip Year’ in Germany because everything failed, and they had only turnips to eat. So when your diet is poor, you are more susceptible to disease.”
Cold weather and increased precipitation also flooded trenches and destroyed battlefields, increasing casualties at the battles of the Somme and Verdun. An estimated 20 million died during WWI and 50 million died during the 1918 influenza pandemic.
In addition to informing the historical understanding of the spread of the Spanish flu, the findings of the study have implications on modern epidemics. Climate research increasingly represents an essential part of epidemiology due to rising concern over the effects of climate change, according to More.
The spread of Zika, Malaria, and COVID-19 also heighten the urgency of the work done by More, McCormick, and their team. Warming temperatures in the northeastern United States allowed tropical climate mosquitoes to spread the Zika virus all the way from Florida to New York, which More said showed that his team’s work is not only relevant to daily life, but vital.
“We have seen a connection between climate events and large outbreaks of disease multiple times,” he said. “We’re trying to figure it out. It’s the cutting edge of environmental health, and obviously, history.”

A year after scientists unveiled the first-ever image of the shadow of the Messier 87 (M87*) black hole, Harvard astrophysicists have made yet another discovery — the crescent-like shadow of that black hole appears to be wobbling.
In a report published on Sept. 23, the group — led by Black Hole Initiative Postdoctoral Fellow Maciek Wielgus — analyzed data collected by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) over the past decade. The researchers combined this archival data with mathematical models to simulate the changes in the flow of matter around M87* over the timescale of months and years. They observed a ring of light surrounding the black hole that varied in brightness at different points, creating a wobbling motion over time.
Sheperd S. Doeleman of the Center for Astrophysics, Founding Director of the EHT and co-author of the paper, likened the method to doing “archaeology through [their] records” and “finding treasure twice.”
The wobbling is unrelated to any motion of M87* itself, but rather the effect of turbulence that may be caused by the motion of gas or plasma falling in. As matter enters, factors like density and temperature cause changes in appearance.
This discovery can help scientists narrow down the possible theoretical models describing accretion, or the accumulation of matter pulled in by the black hole’s powerful gravitational attraction.
Doeleman explained that it would be unusual if there were no variation, as that would be “like going into the ocean and seeing waves come in only at one spot.”
Wielgus elected to use data collected since 2009 due to the slow-moving nature of objects as massive as black holes.
“You don’t expect much to change in the image of a black hole during one week,” he said.
The group also observed that the black hole’s shadow formed a crescent shape, formed by plasma orbiting M87*, and that the diameter of this crescent is consistent with Einstein’s theory of general relativity.
“The matter that’s coming toward us is emitting light, and that’s brighter than the light received from matter which is moving away from us,” Doeleman said, describing why the swirling plasma looked like a crescent. “The size we saw was exactly what Einstein predicted, to within the precision of our measurements.”
University of Birmingham Astrophysics professor Alberto Vecchio described the work as “phenomenal” and of great importance for both theoretical physics and astrophysics research.
“The most extreme objects of [Einstein’s theory of general relativity] are black holes,” he said. “On the fundamental physics side, the importance is to test whether these objects behave as Einstein predicted.”
Understanding the dynamics of M87* might also help predict the behavior of other black holes, including the Sagittarius A* black hole at the center of our galaxy.
“Astrophysicists are always trying to make some more universal theory that can describe a breadth of objects, instead of just trying to look at them one on one,” Lindy Blackburn — a data scientist and radio astronomer at the EHT — said.
Researchers working with the EHT have begun analysis on data collected in 2018 and await further data in 2021.
“In a couple of years, with several high quality data sets, we will be able to really quantify this amount of variation that the system experiences,” Wielgus said.
Scientists have also started work on the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope, which will enable them to create videos of black holes by doubling the number of radio dishes and placing them in optimized locations.
“A decade ago, we predicted that we'd be able to make the first image of a black hole," Doeleman said. "And now in 2020, we're predicting that by the end of this decade, we'll have the first movie of a black hole."

How well parents manage stress and conflict during pregnancy may impact the fetus's brain development and future emotional and behavioral health, according to new research from the Harvard School of Public Health.
In a study published earlier this month, School of Public Health professor Henning Tiemeier and associated researchers found that poor family functioning during pregnancy leads to smaller hippocampus and occipital lobe sizes in childhood. The study contributes to an established body of scholarship on the effect of environmental factors on emotional and behavioral issues.
The researchers tracked a cohort of 2,583 mothers and their children, who were born between 2002 and 2006 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Tiemeier said that this is the second biggest cohort of preadolescents involved in a brain imaging study to date.
Tiemeier said he has always been interested in studying what shapes the brain development of children, but that he was particularly intrigued by how the brain is shaped by our environment and behavior.
"Family conflict and family separation are one of the most important determinants of child developmental and child psychiatric problems — that’s [been] known for about 50 years,” Tiemeier said. “So I was interested in, can we see correlates or an association with brain development if there was family functioning earlier on.”
Researchers asked mothers and any participating fathers to independently rate family relationships at different time points using a well-established questionnaire called the Family Assessment Device. Once the children in the study turned 10, their emotional and behavioral health was documented using the Child Behavior Checklist, and their brain images were collected using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging system.
Tiemeier said he decided to focus on the hippocampus and the amygdala, two structures in the brain, due to their role in emotion and memory regulation.
“[The hippocampus] does many things, but it is most known for its cognition. So it really decides about memory and commission,” Tiemeier said. “And the amygdala next to it is much more involved in emotion, and some would say also emotional memories.”
However, contrary to their hypothesis, the study did not find a correlation between poor family functioning and amygdala size.
Tiemeier said that he hopes his research will emphasize the importance of studying parental psychopathology and more generally the social environment of child psychiatry.
“I felt that much of child psychiatry has moved away from family functioning and factors in the environment and focuses very much on the biology, both in treatment and in explaining it to families,” he said. “We should focus much more on the environment, the family environment, and not medicalize that.”
University of Vermont professor Jim Hudziak echoed many of the implications of Tiemeier’s study on the field of child psychiatry. Hudziak described Tiemeier’s findings as a “call to arms.”
“What Tiemeier et al. have done is show something that is not surprising, and in my own opinion, should be a call to arms for all of us,” Hudziak said. “Smaller hippocampus volumes have a doubtless impact on the function of the hippocampus. And its sub-components make it more difficult for children to regulate their emotions and more difficult for them to perform in academic settings.”
Tiemeier said that in the future, he wants to study not only how social factors — both within and outside of the family — impact the brain, but also what determinants can help overcome both physical and emotional stressors.
“My main goal is to understand how your own behavior shapes all of these processes together, because I think we can see — and that's a very radically different approach — behavior of children much different than adults,” Tiemeier said. “You do shape your brain much more at that age, as like a training thing that helps your behavior also down the road.”

Harvard Business School will rename a building after James I. Cash, the school’s first Black tenured professor, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria told faculty, staff, and students in a virtual town hall Tuesday.
The building was formerly called Glass House — a moniker honoring Carter Glass, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary who promoted racist voting policies. It will now be known as “Cash House.”
Cash served as a member of the Business School faculty from 1976 to 2003 and received tenure in 1985. As a professor, he taught a variety of subjects in the MBA Program and the Executive Education program, including the Program for Management Development, the Program for Global Leadership, and the Advanced Management Program.
Nohria credited Cash as a leader in the fight for racial equity at HBS.
“Not only has he transcended many racial barriers in his own life, he also has propelled generations of Black students, faculty, and staff, as well as scores of business leaders, to successful and meaningful lives and careers,” Nohria said.
The Business School has long come under fire for a lack of Black representation in its student body and faculty. Last week, Nohria announced an action plan for racial equity at the school, including an initiative to recruit more Black professors and faculty.
Nohria wrote in the message to Business School affiliates that the renaming “rectifies a wrong.”
“We therefore cannot allow the Glass name to remain at the School, even while we recognize and cannot forget that it has been a fact of our history for 75 years,” Nohria wrote. “It is important that members of our community see themselves in our spaces and take pride in those whose names define our physical landscape. Cash House will reflect our deepest belief that leaders are individuals of not just great competence, but also outstanding and impeccable character.”
In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Cash served on the boards of a number of corporations, including Walmart, General Electric, and the Microsoft Corporation. Nohria praised his “extraordinary mentorship and friendship” in a message to Business School affiliates Tuesday.
“In addition to his extraordinary intellect and accomplishments, he is a man whose humility and genuine warmth make him beloved by all who know him. Indeed, he once defined power and influence as 'the ability to make things happen without people knowing that you are responsible.' This is how he leads his life, and he honors the School in allowing us to recognize him in this way,” Nohria wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps even more than most, administrators at the Dean of Students Office say they have a difficult task this semester: supporting Harvard undergraduates while only a fraction of them live on campus and others are scattered across the globe.
Even during a virtual semester, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said in a Wednesday interview that the primary focus of her office remains the same — providing support and opportunities to both remote and on-campus students.
“We’re supporting in many ways student organizations through our [Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion] team and certainly through the houses and yards because we have first year students and upper-level students who are learning remotely,” O’Dair said. “We are doing the work and committed to everything we can to ensure that students have as good a semester as they can, given the circumstances.”
O’Dair added that the remote semester has made serving students’ needs a “challenge,” as undergraduates shy away from virtual programming due to Zoom fatigue.
“I just think in general, students are ‘Zoomed out,’” she said. “So I think one of the challenges is how can we continue to support the community and continue to support strong connections with students in addition to how we would gather on Zoom?”
In July, Harvard made the decision to invite only freshmen and select upperclassmen back to campus for an in-residence semester. A number students who enrolled this semester chose to live in off-campus apartments, though, with some even taking up residence in Cambridge and surrounding towns.
The summer also saw some staffing changes at the DSO. Newcomer Alta Mauro — who joined the office in May as Associate Dean of Students for Inclusion and Belonging — said in the interview that her group is trying to replicate “authentic” interaction with students, but also acknowledged that her work is sensitive to student concerns.
“I would say generally we're still figuring this out, what does it mean to cultivate community, what does it mean to connect with people?” she said. “So people are trying to figure that out and trying to replicate it as best we can and I think we're being honest with ourselves when it falls flat. Students are giving that feedback and it feels to me like there's some grace in being collaborative and trying to find the sweet spot.”
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 added that the DSO has relied on the “collaborating and brainstorming” taking place across the College to learn how to better engage with students. Like Mauro, she said student feedback shapes the DSO’s plans.
“This is completely new in so many different ways, not just for students but also for all of us in our work,” Brandt said. “What has been helpful is just when students have reached out and let us know that something is a problem. We can then start to think about ways to address it.”
The remote nature of the DSO’s work is uniquely challenging for Mauro, who succeeded former Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller — himself an interim dean in the role — when he departed Harvard at the end of last academic year. She said that because she has not yet made connections with students, she hopes holding virtual events — such as holding open office hours for students — will help her get up to speed.
“I'm onboarding this way, so many of my colleagues miss their favorite students, but I don't have anyone to miss yet,” she said. “I've been working in student affairs full time since 2004, and this is awkward for many of us, but I don't even have the relationships to call on.”
Despite the efforts of the DSO, O’Dair said that no programming is capable of replacing in-person student interaction — a reality the DSO will continue to face.
“I realize in the roles that we're in, we can't take for granted how important it is to have that student interaction and it can't necessarily be replicated on zoom, there's something about being in person,” she said. “We're adapting the best we can, but it's not the same. It's just not the same.”

Meteors that grazed Earth’s atmosphere could have brought microbial life from Earth to Venus, Harvard Astronomy department chair Avi Loeb and College student Amir Siraj ’22 hypothesized in a new research study, made available in preprint last week.
Earlier this month, researchers affiliated with MIT, Cardiff University, Harvard, and other institutions detected potential signs of life on Venus, in the form of phosphine gas in the planet’s atmosphere.
With corrosive droplets of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere and surface temperatures surpassing 800 degrees Fahrenheit, Venus appears an unlikely candidate for extraterrestrial life.
This led Loeb and Siraj to question whether any potential Venusian life might not really be alien after all; rather, it could have come from life on Earth.
“The bottom line is that you could have a transfer of life between Venus and the Earth. It's a process that was not considered before,” Loeb said. “People thought about what happens if a meteor hits the Earth, splatters the rock on the Earth, and then [sends] pieces of rock flying into space, and they hit Venus. That's a very different process, and it's not clear that life can survive such an impact.”
According to Loeb, this traditional idea of meteorite debris from Earth eventually reaching Venus leaves potential microbes exposed to more heat and radiation on their journey than they can withstand. Instead, Loeb and Siraj proposed the idea of meteors that graze Earth’s atmosphere.
“So then we came up with this idea of grazing, almost like a spoon taking the foam off of a cappuccino, and on top of the cappucino, these meteors can basically scoop up any microbes that exist in the atmosphere,” Siraj said.
A grazing meteor would enter the Earth’s atmosphere and then exit off into space, according to Loeb. The meteor would provide porous places for microbes to be shielded from harmful radiation. Since the meteor is only lightly brushing the atmosphere, it avoids excessive heating.
“If [an organism is] deep inside the rock, it's sort of protected. The rock serves as the spacesuit for these microbes,” Loeb said.
Loeb and Siraj estimated that, over the history of our solar system, at least 600,000 meteors may have passed through Earth’s atmosphere, and then landed on Venus within the next 100,000 years. The microbes they picked up on Earth could likely survive the journey to the neighboring planet.
Once the microbes reach Venus, they would likely live in the planet’s 35-mile-high cloud layer, which is cooler and less dense than the scorching surface of the planet.
“There, the temperature is similar to what we have here, in the lower atmosphere of the Earth,” Loeb said. “So, the clouds are habitable in principle, they have the right temperature and pressure. There might be microbes living inside the droplets.”
Although the meteor grazing idea appears promising, Siraj acknowledges that there is more work to be done. For this hypothesis to be accepted, Siraj said, researchers would need to study the abundance and variety of microbes in Earth’s atmosphere that could have been picked up by meteors.
Ultimately, confirmation of Loeb and Siraj’s theory will depend on the ongoing investigation into life on Venus.
“The best way to test this hypothesis will simply be to search for life on Venus, and if it is found, checking whether or not it shares chemical and biological structures and underpinnings with life on Earth,” Siraj said.

Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that COVID-19 prevalence rates in regions of New York City were associated with work-related commuting, according to a study published earlier this month.
The study, published in the renowned peer-reviewed publication Nature Communications, was co-first authored by five researchers, including postdoctoral research fellow Stephen M. Kissler and research fellow Nishant Kishore, and co-led by Associate Professor of Epidemiology Caroline O. Buckee and Yonatan H. Grad, Assistant Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases.
The experiment compared COVID-19 prevalence rates in four of New York City’s boroughs — Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens — with movement patterns of roughly one million local users obtained from Facebook’s Data for Good program. The researchers selected data demonstrating travel between boroughs thought to be associated with commuting.
The researchers used COVID-19 test results administered to 1,746 pregnant women hospitalized for delivery throughout those boroughs between March 22 and May 3 as a proxy for population prevalence rates, which they calculated using a statistical model.
The study found that Manhattan, the borough with the highest reduction in commuting — 68.7 percent — also had the lowest estimated COVID-19 infection rate — 11.3 percent. On the other extreme, South Queens experienced the lowest reduction in commuting — 41.4 percent — and the highest prevalence rate of COVID-19 — 26.0 percent.
The study joined Kishore and Kissler’s different areas of expertise to offer insight into how New York City experienced the coronavirus pandemic. At Harvard, Kishore studies human mobility data while Kissler’s research focuses on mathematical modeling related to infectious diseases.
“We were able to sort of put together this story where it really looked like the variation in prevalence of COVID-19 across New York City was closely related to basically whether or not people can stay home from work,” Kissler said.
Kishore explained that the study chose pregnant women as a sample population because available data on COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality rates does not accurately reflect natural infection levels in a population.
“People that will come in are generally people that are sick because those are the people that will get tested. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that those are all the people that have COVID in a given area,” he said. “So this allowed us to universally sample people coming in for a procedure that should be generally representative of the areas from which they come.”
Kishore also said the study’s findings confirm anecdotal evidence that suggests essential workers are at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus.
“I don’t think that it’s earth shattering or incredibly new news that there are certain segments of the population that are unable to physically distance that are essential workers and go on the train or travel in some way to go to work,” he said. “It makes sense that these would also be the population that are at higher risk of being affected by COVID.”
Kissler said the study reveals there can be vast differences in the effects of the coronavirus within one region.
“In New York City, which up until recently was the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, different neighborhoods in New York City were affected hugely differently,” he said. “It’s really difficult to generalize anything either across the country or between cities or even within cities, because different communities suffer from this outbreak so differently.”
Still, he emphasized that everyone can do their part to reduce transmission.
“It’s really important to keep in mind that this is something we’re going to be dealing with for a while longer, at the very least the next six to 12 months,” he said. “We have a pretty good sense of what we can do to help. Physical distancing and masks and these sorts of things are all very effective.”

The City of Cambridge will require everyone over the age of two to wear face masks in indoor common areas and all outdoor spaces — regardless of whether they are able to maintain social distancing of six feet — starting Oct. 2, according to an amended version of the city’s emergency mask order released Friday.
The amended order defines indoor common areas as all businesses open to the public, as well as lobbies, hallways, stairwells, elevators, laundry rooms, parking garages, and other common areas of residential buildings. Outdoor spaces include sidewalks, streets, parks, bus stops, non-residential parking facilities, and all other outdoor areas.
The new requirements also specify that employees may only remove face coverings when working alone in an individual office with the door closed, or when working alone in an office suite. Violators of the amended order may be issued warning or a $300 fee.
In an announcement released Friday, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said the city hopes to reduce transmission of coronavirus by tightening mask requirements as people begin to spend more time indoors.
“It is clear that wearing a mask or face covering is a key requirement in combating this pandemic,” he said.
“With people spending more time indoors, there is an increased risk of spreading COVID-19. By tightening and clarifying our face-covering requirements now, we hope to continue minimizing COVID-19 risk in Cambridge,” he added.
The amended order replaces the city’s previous requirements, which allowed people to remove face coverings while outside during the summer months so long as a distance of six feet could be maintained at all times.
Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude A. Jacobs said the city has seen an increase in infections and advised residents to remain vigilant when it comes to wearing a mask.
“We’ve seen a slight uptick in average daily COVID-19 infections among city residents in September compared to last month, which includes cases at the higher education institutions as well as in the broader community,” Jacob said in the city’s Friday announcement.
“We urge residents to remain vigilant about mask-wearing and to avoid spending time in poorly ventilated indoor spaces or at crowded gatherings where physical distancing is difficult,” he added.
As of Wednesday, 1,396 Cambridge residents have tested positive for COVID-19, and the city has confirmed 100 coronavirus deaths.

Former United States Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Juliette N. Kayyem '91 spoke to Harvard College students about her experience in public service and her perspective on various current homeland security issues at a Q&A session Wednesday.
Kayyem has worked with both the Massachusetts government and the Obama administration on Homeland Security issues ranging from terrorism to the H1N1 pandemic and is now a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. The event — hosted by the Harvard University Foreign Policy Initiative — covered a wide range of topics, including white supremacy and the current administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Kayyem spoke on increased hyperpolarization in United States politics and the ways politicians can contribute to this radicalization.
“This is where a leader uses his pulpit to incite — through speech or Twitter feed or debate — to incite violence that is interpreted by the followers as approval and domain [...] but allows the leader to have plausible deniability,” she said.
When asked how she would advise national leaders on COVID-19 policies, Kayyem said that while the military is often proposed as a solution for vaccine distribution, she does not believe this should be their role.
“The military has to be very careful about being viewed as settling political differences,” Kayyem said.
Instead, she said she believes that governors should be in charge of vaccine distribution.
“The vaccine distribution is going to be very, very political,” Kayyem said. “I would rather have a civilian entity, a civilian expert who knows how to do this.”
Andrew J. Shaw ’24 asked Kayyem about the role of traditionally nonpartisan representatives — particularly if officials, like former United States Secretary of Defense, General James N. Mattis, should take political stances against President Donald J. Trump.
“My barometer would be: If I don't speak and, let's say with Trump, the person is reelected, how will I feel the next day?” Kayyem said.
Mattis resigned from his post as Secretary of Defense in late 2018 after Trump ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Syria and Afghanistan against the advice of advisors like Mattis. Since his resignation, Mattis has criticized the president for ordering the U.S. military to quell protests in cities across the country after the police killing of George Floyd.
Kayyem added that this is a unique time in US politics and predicted that we could be hearing more from Mattis in October, closer to the election.
Heidi D. Jacobson ’24, who attended the event, said she was inspired by the perspective Kayyem shared during the discussion.
“I really liked the way that she seemed to go after her goals,” Jacobson said. “I’ve never really talked to someone who's in this field, or actually even gotten any sense of what it would be like and I think that just seeing her was kind of inspirational for me.”
This event is the second in a speaker series hosted by HUFPI centered around discussing foreign policy and international events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a legal victory over the summer, University President Lawrence S. Bacow dialed into Capitol Hill to continue to advocate for more lenient visa policies for international students who are forced to take online courses amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
In an interview with The Crimson on Friday, he said he had spoken with one Representative and three Senators in the past week — all via phone or Zoom.
“What I've been working on most recently is trying to generate support for the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that is offered by Representatives Pressley and Moulton of Massachusetts, which would ensure access to the United States for foreign students who seek to come study here, regardless of whether or not their institutions are providing in person instruction or online instruction,” Bacow said.
At the start of the pandemic, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement altered their policy to allow foreign students completing online-only coursework to remain in the country on their student visas. But in July, they rescinded the exception and declared only students taking some in-person courses could stay in the U.S.
In response, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a lawsuit against the agencies. Days later, DHS and ICE reverted back the altered policy they had announced at the start of the pandemic, allowing international students already in the country to stay.
Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.)and Rep. Seth W. Moulton ’01 (D-Mass.) put forth an amendment to codify that exception into law. They proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which provides annual funding and policies for the Department of Defense and contains some visa regulations.
Their amendment dictates that foreign students “may engage in online or distance education classes or programs that are determined necessary by an institution [...] for the protection of health and safety” through June 30, 2021, or 90 days after the end of the public health crisis, whichever is later.
It also mandates that online courses “shall count towards the requirement to pursue a full course of study” — a requirement for students to retain their visas.
The House of Representatives moved to include their amendment on July 21. Later that day, the House voted 295-125 to pass its National Defense Authorization Act.
On July 23, the Senate voted 86-14 to pass its National Defense Authorization Act — though it lacked the amendment to protect international students.
Currently, the legislation is in “conference” — the process by which members of the House and Senate seek to resolve discrepancies between their versions of the law. Conference will likely not be complete before Election Day on Nov. 3, a member of the committee told Defense News.
After their amendment passed in the House, Pressley and Moulton released statements extolling its importance for international students.
Pressley said she was “relieved” the administration listened to public pressure and revoked a “bigoted policy.”
“This amendment will protect international students while allowing our higher education institutions to take the appropriate steps to keep their communities healthy and mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” she added.
Moulton said removing visas from international students studying at American schools was “xenophobic.”
“When international students can learn in America, many stay and bring their valuable perspectives, languages, and talents to institutions that protect our national security,” Moulton said in a statement in July. "I'm going to keep fighting so international students studying here can stay and worry about their classes, not about a president who wants to demonize them.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email to The Crimson earlier this month that Bacow has continued to take “an active role in advancing the University’s priorities at the federal level,” including “federal research funding, immigration, scientific research, and public health – including managing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the University’s response.”

So… here we are. Back to a semester of remote learning. Only this time, it’s revamped with new lecture formats, take-home tests, and Zoom extensions! Which extension do you relate most to? Which ones make you want to log out of absolutely everything? Take this quiz to find out.
Your Wi-Fi crashes during a Zoom lecture, what do you do?
A. Someone near you is likely sucking it all up, and you will send them a passive aggressive text about it.
B. Eh, it is what it is. Time for snack #4325 of the day!
C. Text your friend in the class ASAP and ask them to catch you up on what you’re missing.
D. Wait until it comes back and hope that your face didn’t freeze on some weird expression.
What is your social distancing activity of choice?
A. A brief walk outside, mask tightly secured and sanitizer clutched in hand.
B. It’s just you, some takeout, and Netflix, baby!
C. Picnic blankets, social distanced circles, and some Large Outdoor Space™.
D. A Zoom catch up session with your blocking group full of laughs and Wi-Fi troubles.
Method of choice for keeping track of deadlines and assignments?
A. Google Calendar; it never fails. *Chef’s kiss*
B. Tons and tons of alarms throughout the day… Yup.
C. A beautifully elaborate bullet journal that makes a daily appearance on your IG story.
D. An ongoing list in your Notes section that includes everything you need to do.
How do you handle awkward breakout rooms?
A. Pretend your computer is glitching and turn off your camera for good measure; now you can cram in some readings!
B. Mic off, head down, but ears open listening to the painful conversations.
C. Ask everyone for that good ol’ Harvard Introduction to get the conversation started.
D. Bare minimum participation until you see that beautiful “Return to Main Session” button; then you’re out.
What do you do during the 15 minutes between classes now that they aren’t spent running across campus?
A. Checking Canvas to make sure you haven’t missed any random deadlines.
B. Fixing yourself a snack to eat during your next lecture, duh!
C. Catching up on social media feeds for some semblance of human interaction.
D. Napping. Zoom just takes it all out of you.
Results: 
Mostly A’s: Gradescope
You definitely have a specific, personal method for approaching almost everything, and silently judge others for doing it any other way. Deadlines are your worst nightmare, and you’re always thinking about how much time you have left before your assignments are due. Though you’re constantly in a heightened state of nervousness, it helps you work more efficiently under high pressure situations. Others know you will put in your 100% to whatever you set your mind to!
Mostly B’s: Panopto
While you aren’t a social butterfly, per say, people know you well enough to give you that awkward eye smile from under their masks as they pass by. You’re the one who is quite content to chill by themselves each day, but is usually down for a random FaceTime call every now and then. Quarantine has been a pretty good time to brush up on your baking skills, so you have those 15 minute snack breaks down to an art form by this point.
Mostly C’s: Slack
Even with social distancing conditions, you won’t be stopped from trying to [safely] live life to the fullest. It’s an ongoing struggle to be both down-to-business and cool looking, but you’re working on it (read: joining every group chat possible). As a self-proclaimed extrovert, you’re all about those pre-planned outdoor meetups and keeping the conversation going during breakouts rooms. Your LinkedIn is somehow popping off even in these remote circumstances, so go you!
Mostly D’s: Jamboard
Let’s be honest: you’re really just looking to try your best this semester. While you didn’t start off this semester on the best note— how is it possible for my.harvard, Canvas, and Zoom to crash all at the same time?— you still have high hopes for the rest of Fall 2020. You’re spreading yourself a little thin already with all sorts of different clubs and organizations, so remember to take it easy every once in a while. Having already experienced every technical difficulty in the book, it’s only up from here, baby!
