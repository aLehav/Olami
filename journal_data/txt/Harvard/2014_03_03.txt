After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When “Collard Greens,” Schoolboy Q’s first single from his second album, “Oxymoron,” was released almost a year ago, it was clear that featured artist Kendrick Lamar was under strict orders from Schoolboy to do something a little bit different. For one, the song is an unapologetic weed-smoking anthem, although Kendrick spent his first two studio albums, “Section.80” and “Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City,” discussing negative experiences with marijuana and his desire to be free from chemical dependence. It’s not surprising when the eternally irresponsible Schoolboy raps, “Smoke this/ drink this/ straight to my liver,” but when the usually ruminative, or at least complicated, Kendrick responds with, “I’m famous / I blame this on you / cash in the mirror,” he announces his label mate’s de facto mission to explore base instincts and yearnings over deeper content and lyricism. Schoolboy’s aesthetic—brash, abrasive, and concise—even dominates K.Dot’s, the reigning king of wordplay. The result of Schoolboy’s choice to revel in sin, “Oxymoron”—a pulsating, aggressive beast that makes his first release look like easy listening music—is a sonically impressive but somewhat emotionally stunted and one-dimensional mix of trap beats, violent verses, and vague tales of L.A. street life.
 
The punny album title can be read as a cleverly packaged announcement that Schoolboy likes “oxy” (oxycotin, along with many other drugs, judging from the album’s constant invocations of lean, crack, and a bevy of prescription pills) and is kind of a moron. Perhaps Schoolboy means something more intellectual by the name, but it works well for what he presents; the album is at its best when he allows himself to give in completely to both of these identifiers. The “upper” songs, like the opener “Gangsta,” are filled with big beats, drug-heavy lyrics, and repetitivwe mantras that substitute for more structured choruses. The organized chaos of “Gangsta,” which revolves around a call-and-response of “knock knock knock,” and “gangsta shit, gangsta shit,” is exhilarating. Schoolboy boasts about what The Notorious B.I.G. poetically referred to as “gats and stuff,”  his presence just barely fitting the cadence of the lumbering and rhythmically bombastic backing track. Highlights “Man of the Year” and “Blind Threats” follow in this track’s footsteps, to intimidating and effective results.
 
When Schoolboy Q attempts to inject melody or lyrical subtlety into the project, however, his verses come off as trite and often laughable. Although seemingly unapologetic about his drug use for the vast majority of the album, Schoolboy ventures into mopey addiction territory with “Prescription/Oxymoron,” a two-part polemic on his attempts to stop selling crack and blacking out off of his cocktail of prescriptions. The song reveals the limitations of Schoolboy’s lyricism; although he racks up a far higher word count over the course of the epic, he sounds restrained, unsure of his message, and more focused on being bummed out about drugs than spinning an emotionally varied tale. When he laments, “My mommy call, I hit ignore / my daughter calls, I press ignore” he comes off more maudlin than soul-bearing.
 
Thankfully, few other songs on the album fall into the rabbit hole of negative self-analysis. The energetic and aesthetically consistent beats, created by producers as diverse as Tyler, the Creator and The Alchemist, beg for twisted tales of L.A. sin far more than confessionals. Most of the beats aren’t especially melodic or sample-heavy, and when they are, the results are often disastrous. Although “Los Awesome” manages to pull off a dissonant outro reminiscent of Kanye West’s “Hold My Liquor,” the bonus track, “His & Her Friend,” which attempts to recapture the murky aesthetic, is blatantly imitative and out of place. The grittier and more percussive the beats are, the better. The group of beats that lay the foundation for the bangers are influenced by trap music, an increasingly popular sound identified by 808s and loud drums, intricate beat changes, and heavily layered synth. This is by far the most trap-influenced work by anyone affiliated with Black Hippy as of yet, and is a medium that has potential for Schoolboy’s ability to switch up tempos and bring the loud.
 
Schoolboy is obviously not an especially happy guy. In February, he went public about his ongoing real-life codeine addiction and often appears drugged out and nihilistic during interviews. “Oxymoron” is certainly effective when it’s angry, but it’s least convincing when it wanders into the down-tempo and sad, which suggests a lot of room for range expansion and emotional growth for the artist. As long as Schoolboy can only create honest and kinetic music when shying away from his demons—a decidedly anti-Kendrick trait—he will never compete with Black Hippy’s superstar. But if he manages to counter his raw and rough side with real emotion and find an effective sound with which to attempt this transformation, he can rise to the elite of the TDE Crew and the rap game.

Ever since the Citizens United decision in 2010, American elections have been deluged with campaign spending conducted through the much-maligned super PACs. But at the very least, super PACs are required to disclose their donors. The same does not hold for 501(c)(4) organizations that were allowed to spend unlimited, anonymous funds on elections so long as 51 percent of the funds were going toward “social welfare.” But a newly proposed IRS regulation would rightly do away with this dangerously opaque influx of money—and it couldn’t come soon enough.
Crossroads GPS, the conservative advocacy group runby the Republican king-maker Karl Rove, spent more than $70.5 million alone on Republican candidates. Social welfare 501(c)(4) groups collectively spent a staggering $305 million in the 2012 election cycle, all without the donor disclosure needed for other political committees. When a loophole is largeenough to let through hundreds of millions of dollars in mysterious spending, something has gone terribly wrong.
That loophole was not created through an act of Congress, but through an internal rule at the IRS that could soon be corrected. A 501(c)(4) organization is classified by the IRS as one that “is operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare.” In contrast to the stark language, the 51-percent rule went largely unchallenged, but now the vague standard has proven itself to be inadequate for policing the new political landscape.
Though it appears that large-money races are here to stay given the Supreme Court’s recent attitude toward campaign finance reform, there is no need for these donations to be given in secret, where the media and electorate are left in the dark on the possible motivations of their elected officials.
Opponents of campaign finance regulation may argue that capping donations and mandating donor disclosure infringes on free speech, but how can the marketplace of ideas function if we don’t know who is selling the wares? A report on the environmental impact of the Keystone Pipeline would elicit different reactions if it were written by Transcanada, the oil company that stands to make billions from its completion, than if it were written by Greenpeace.
But when wealthy individuals and corporations are able to funnel their dollars anonymously, that essential element for effective public discourse is missing. Instead, the public is left without a clue as to the motives lurking behind the slickly-produced ads. Candidates implicitly bend their ears toward the increasingly necessary independent expenditure groups to ensure their political survival.
All this happens under closed doors. But light can be shone on this murky area of campaign finance law with a simple reinterpretation of the rules—one that does not run afoul of federal laws or Supreme Court decisions.
It might be a simple change, but it’s an important step forward.

To the editor:
Sections are some of the worst and best educational experiences Harvard students have. The impulse behind the recent demands by the Graduate Student Council and the Philosophy Department reported by The Crimson last Friday is right on. Harvard needs to see sections as a critical component of undergraduate education and provide the necessary support so that sections provide the best and not the worst of experiences.
However, the demand that all sections have 12 or fewer students is off the mark. Certainly when sections are made mandatorywith the intent of incorporating a seminar experience within a lecture course or when teaching fellows are expected to provide extensive comments on written work, section sizes of 12 may well be needed in order to provide students with a first-rate experience. But when sections are not required, and their purpose is to review lecture materials or they are simply help sessions, effective sections can be much larger. What is needed in a philosophy course may be quite different than, say, a statistics or math course. One size does not fit all.
Focusing on size also misses other important problems with the current system. Departments that offer many large courses frequently have to hire non-departmental students who too often don’t have the requisite background. Similarly, graduate students frequently don’t know what course they will be assigned to until the second week of classes, meaning that they have no time to master the course material prior to the beginning of the semester. Departments also differ widely in how much training in teaching they give their graduate students—some require semester long courses, e.g. psychology and sociology, others little to none at all. If a department has to hire students from outside (HLS, HKS, other FAS departments, or outside Harvard altogether), there is no guarantee at all that the teaching fellowwill have had any preparation for teaching.
Harvard attracts the very best graduate students in the world. More than a few will be both superstar researchers and teachers in the future. In the role of teaching fellows, they can be a key component in the undergraduate educational experience. Harvard, however, needs to make sure that it supports, and uses sections in a way that ensures that its undergraduate receive the very best education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back held stiffly in place, neck arched forward, and elbows cut off, the International Symbol of Access is due for a makeover. We all identify the white stickfigure, riding a wheelchair in his blue box of a home, as the emblem of the physically disabled.
And when I say “we all,” I mean it literally. Certain designs, including the ISA, signal an identical message across the globe. Every day, Egyptians locate escalators, Dominicans defibrillators, and Fins fire-exits, all thanks to the International Organization for Standardization. The ISO dictates the universal standard for thousands of designs that instantly communicate a service, a hazard, or even an identity.
And society’s understanding of the disabled identity has been colored with prejudice. Ableism, though American society only began to recognize it during the civil rights movement , has plagued this country for centuries. “Ugly laws” criminalized persons with physical disabilities to appear in public. Persons with mental disabilities face a dark history of asylums, imprisonments, and confinement. It’s no surprise, then, that remnants of ableism still lurk in the21st century United States. Well-intentioned people continue to believe that the able-bodied are the norm. Everyday acts perpetuate the idea that the disabled should strive to become able-bodied, that disability is an error rather than an element of diversity, contributing to society as much as any other degree of physical ability.
Everyday symbols—notably the ISA—perpetuate ableism as well. Ramps, parking spots, restrooms, and doors therefore reflect an image that represents the disabled. The Accessible Icon Project, driven by a desire for a more progressive understanding of persons of different ability, takes note of this fact and criticizes the ISA on several counts. While the AIP acknowledges the strides in understanding ability that the development of the ISA represents, they also note the unnatural passivity of the dated design: “Its arms and legs are drawn like mechanical parts, its posture is unnaturally erect, and its entire look is one that makes the chair, not the person, important and visible.”
Guerrilla artists in Cambridge have also contested the ISA by drawing graffiti over the traditional image of the ISA with an updated version, designed to empower persons of different ability. The updated pictogram depicts an active wheelchair user, independent in his own right. The Accessible Icon distinguishes itself from the traditional ISA in five ways.
First, the person’s head leans forward to indicate conscious decision-making. Second, the arm swings back to demonstrate the active nature of wheelchair use. Third, two wheel cutouts present the chairin motion. Fourth, the pictogram’s limbs match up with the body’s representation in ISO symbols depicting the able-bodied. And lastly, the leg position clearly separates the person from the wheelchair.
New York City has replaced the ISA with the Accessible Icon in all five boroughs, according to NPR. So has San Antonio, Williams College, REI, and even Wal-Mart. This is the latest step in the ISA’s evolution: Activist designers updated the ISA once before, adding a head to the formerly decapitated icon.
Designs define and reflect identity. They brief us on the meaning of female, male, African-American, Caucasian, pedestrian, child, adult, and family. They cast back definitions of appropriate behavior and cultural norms. Do white pictograms on wheelchairs in blue squares simply indicate compliance with the American Disability Act? Does the wall separating the male from the female on restroom doors hold cultural significance? How about the clothing those pictograms wear?
Of course. Symbols mean far more than they purport to be. They assume social paradigms and legal standards. Changing design forces bystanders to think, to reassess identity. So rethinking the ISA design isn’t enough. As the ISO considers the Accessibility Icon, the world must consider what the icon represents. Perhaps, with this updated icon, society will considered the issue of ableism, even if just for a moment.

UPDATED: March 3, 2014, at 2:49 a.m.
Harvard just appointed a new college dean with lots of background in leadership but little experience in undergraduate education. Rakesh Khurana has taught a class on “leadership and organizational behavior” at Harvard Business School for years but his dual appointment in the sociology department was created only earlier this year. I respect Dr. Khurana as a person, but I’m perplexed that someone who has never taught Harvard undergraduates was chosen as Dean of the College.
Perhaps, then, this is a good time to interrogate the role of the university administrator. How should someone’s academic qualifications prepare them to run a modern university? Does the modern corporatized university require corporate leadership?
Two years ago, Staples tapped Drew G. Faust for its board of directors. On its website, the office supply company touts her “extensive leadership and management experience and skills related to recruiting top talent, capital planning, financial oversight, risk management, technology and strategy.” Faust has spent her entire career in universities—first as a professor, then as an administrator. Apparently, Faust’s “extensive … management experience” and skill in “financial oversight” comes from her time as dean and then president at Harvard.
At first glance, it might appear strange that Faust has the requisite skills to advise a major for-profit corporation. But today Harvard’s president spends much of her time on management and finance. 
The academic and business elite once intersected in the Harvard administration. Legal scholar and Harvard president from 1909 to 1933, Abbot Lawrence Lowell hailed from two of Massachusetts’s richest families, which had made their fortunes from the textile mills of Lawrence and Lowell. Drawing on his personal wealth and business acumen, President Lowell oversaw the quintupling of the University’s endowment, from $23 million to over $120 million.
As our admissions policies grew more egalitarian, the University’s most respected academics were not drawn exclusively from the ranks of Boston brahmins. The administration, too, changed. Neil Rudenstine, Harvard’s president from 1991 to 2001, is a man of letters from a working-class background.
By Rudenstine’s time, however, Harvard functioned more and more like a corporation, investing its massive endowment to maximize returns and neglecting the social and ecological costs of irresponsible ventures. Harvard has sought out financial analysts to consolidate and centralize Harvard Library in an effort to raise efficiency and lower costs. When short on money, Harvard cuts budgets by slashing low-wage jobs and subcontracting work to the lowest bidder. These decisions are made by administrators in consultation with the Harvard Management Company, and perhaps the Harvard Corporation, with University faculty, students, and workers cut out of the process.
These are the sort of tactics usually implemented by corporations desperately trying to make a profit. Now, they have become the standard for educational and research institutions, as well. How does this affect the day-to-day life of an administrator?
A November 2009 photo essay published by Harvard on “A day in the life of President Faust” follows our president as she mingles with captains of industry, government officials, and artists, her schedule planned to the minute by Senior Special Assistant Lars Madsen. Nonetheless, Faust seems isolated from the University’s academic and cultural life.
Instead, Faust has involved herself in the University’s financial situation. For example, she weighs in on decisions about how to invest Harvard’s massive endowment. As Harvard sought to rebuild its endowment from the 2009 tumble, Harvard Management Company CEO Jane Mendillo “started meeting weekly with Harvard President Drew Faust,” according to Businessweek, as she increased the school’s holdings in forests and farms in the developing world. While Faust only hosts undergraduate office hours for two hours a semester, she can make time for weekly conversations about timber plantations. It is clear where our President’s priorities lie.
From endowment management to budget-cutting, press relations to negotiations, it almost seems like the role of University administrator might be better suited for a businessperson. Maybe Rakesh Khurana is perfect for the job, after all.
Students love interim Dean Donald Pfister for his quirky, down-to-earth emails and sense of humor. Pfister has proven that the Dean of Harvard College can find time to ride the shuttle and write his own emails. He proudly shares his academic interests with students by offering tours of Harvard Yard’s trees and the Natural History Museum. Perhaps Pfister can get away with this because he is only an interim dean—I don’t know how much Pfister is involved in the University politics that plagued Evelynn M. Hammonds. Nonetheless, he provides a model for a University administrator who interacts with undergraduates as much as he watches University finances.
While Harvard may be overtaken with financial considerations, the university’s main purpose is the pursuit of knowledge. Dean Pfister’s engagement with students’ social and academic lives should not be exceptional. 
The appointments of Evelynn Hammonds as College dean and Drew Faust as University president challenged the status quo in the same way Rudenstine’s appointment did 25 years ago. Yet these academics have been consumed by financial and managerial tasks, to the detriment of our university’s values. Let’s hope that, in his time as Dean of Harvard College, Khurana draws more from his experience as Cabot House Master than as Business School professor. Our dean should value critical and imaginative thinking more than balancing the books.

The Harvard University Police Department issued a community advisory Saturday evening after a female unaffiliated with the University reported that she was attacked and robbed while walking near Leverett House on Memorial Drive early Saturday morning.
 
The victim said that an unknown male grabbed her and took her wallet before pushing her to the ground in response to her attempt to resist. The offender reportedly fled the scene and was not apprehended as of Saturday evening.
 
The attack took place near Plympton Street at around 12:50 a.m, according to the report.
While the robbery was not on Harvard property, the email notification was sent to Harvard students and faculty members Saturday night by Steven G. Catalano, the department’s public information officer.
 
Catalano said that the Cambridge Police Department has taken the incident under investigation and HUPD has “increased its presence in the area” in response.
 
In the email, Catalano suggested methods for the prevention of similar incidents in the future. “If you suspect you are being followed,” Catalano wrote, “stay away from dimly lit areas and head for a store or building that you know to be open. Trust your instincts. If you feel uncomfortable about someone near you, head for a populated area and call the Harvard University Police Department.”
 
CPD recently reported a 50-year low in the city’s serious crime rate. Robbery and aggravated assault fall under the department’s classification of serious crime.

Undergraduates are given a week to shop courses at the beginning of each semester, but for many of the thousands who took advantage of the add/drop deadline on Feb. 24, one week is not enough time to gauge whether or not they will succeed in the course.
 
Instead, these students and resident deans said that the four-week period before “fifth Monday” acts as an extension of shopping week, rendering soft the study card deadline.
 
“One week is a very short time to fully understand what is going on in a class,” said Alind Z. Amedi ’16, who noted that he has dropped one course after the study card deadline each semester once he realized they did not meet his expectations. “During [shopping week], the first few lectures are not reflective of what the class will be like later.”
 
Amedi is by no means alone in shuffling his schedule in the middle of the semester.
 
By Feb. 24, the deadline to add or drop a course, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office had processed 1,745 undergraduate add forms and 2,091 undergraduate drop forms, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke. Though students can still withdraw from courses until March 10, the Feb. 24 deadline was the last day on which the action would not appear on their transcripts.
 
According to Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell, many students commit to more courses than they intend to take in order to avoid paying the $40 fee for a late study card.
 
“I know that some students, when they file their study card, are not fully sure yet about their classes,” Howell said. “Rather than delay their study card, they add five courses.”
 
Other students are more deliberate and said that they submit alternative courses on their study card, in case something goes wrong with a top choice.
 
Athena P. Bowe ’15, who dropped Science of Living Systems 16: “Human Evolution and Human Health” in favor of an additional semester of her junior tutorial, said that she had always intended to take the tutorial but wanted to ensure the course met her expectations before fully committing.
 
“I wasn’t sure how the junior tutorial was going to be set up, and I thought it might be a little messy, so I thought I might have a backup,” Bowe said.
 
As it stands, the add/drop deadline falls before when the majority of midterms take place. Many students said that these first papers and exams offer the best indication of whether or not a course is right for them. As a result, they said, the deadline should be pushed even further into the semester.
 
“If [the deadline to drop a course] were right after the first midterm, you could take the midterm and realize, ‘Oh my gosh, that was really hard. I did terrible. I should drop this and not have the fear of having a withdrawal on my transcript,’” said Cody R. Dales ’15.
 
Dales noted that other peer institutions—like MIT, Yale, and Cornell—allow students to drop courses between seven and 12 weeks into the semester, following at least the first round of midterms.
 
“In a perfect world…you would perhaps get some feedback in the form of an exam or a paper to gauge how well you are getting the material before you have to make the decision to add or drop a class,” Crimson Yard Resident Dean Catherine R. Shapiro said. “But there has to be some sort of policy.”
 
Bowe agreed with Shapiro, noting that students already have all of shopping week and add/drop period to decide what courses to take.
 
“It would be nice to have the option to drop later, but at some time you have to realize you have to commit to a class,”  Bowe said.

UPDATED: March 3, 2014, at 10:58 p.m.
Due to federal regulations, edX plans to block students in Cuba, Iran, and Sudan from taking an upcoming online course on aerodynamics and modern aircraft design, according to a blog post written by edX president Anant Agarwal on Monday.
“We are deeply sorry to have to block any student anywhere from taking an edX course,” Agarwal wrote in the post. “This is completely antithetical to the vision and foundational values of edX and all [massive open online courses]. We will continue to work diligently with the U.S. government until every student, from any country in the world, can take any course they choose on edX.”
The course, entitled “Flight Vehicle Aerodynamics” and taught by MIT faculty, covers advanced physics and aircraft design. It is scheduled to begin classes on March 5.
After months of edX petitioning the U.S. government to distribute courses to Cuba, Iran, and Sudan, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control refused to grant edX a license to allow students in those countries to take the aerodynamics course.
“EdX recently learned that this course was not covered by the licenses granted to us for offering courses to students in these countries,” Agarwal said.
The U.S. Department of State has designated Cuba, Iran, and Sudan as State Sponsors of Terrorism, a status accompanied by sanctions that include embargo laws to “penalize persons and countries engaging in certain trade with state sponsors,” according to the State Department website. Syria has also had State Sponsor of Terrorism status since December of 1979.
EdX will temporarily prevent students in the three embargoed countries from accessing the course by blocking their IP addresses, which identify users by location.
EdX is not the first online education platform to block students in these countries from accessing course content. The for-profit online education platform Coursera stopped distributing course material to students in Cuba, Iran, and Sudan during late January citing the State Department sanctions that prevent the transfer of services to State Sponsors of Terrorism.
Despite U.S. sanctions, edX has previously tried to avoid blocking content to any users worldwide. On February 2nd, Agarwal wrote a blog post announcing that edX would not have to block course content to any countries.
According to the post, the company had obtained the necessary licenses to permit the distribution of courses to the embargoed countries.
However, according to Tena Herlihy, vice president and general counsel of edX, the licenses obtained for Cuba, Iran, and Sudan were specific and therefore required edX to submit each new advanced STEM course individually for review before distributing it to those countries.
Herlihy also said that edX received a general license to distribute all of its courses—including “Flight Vehicle Aerodynamics”—to Syria.
 
Herlihy noted that discussions are still ongoing. She added that she expects to hear more details on the status of the course in the coming weeks.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: March 4, 2014
An earlier version of this article stated that edX must submit each new course it offers in Cuba, Iran, and Sudan for a licensing review before it can be made availible. To clarify, the licensing process is only required for advanced STEM courses.

Members of the Academic Integrity Committee are in the process of refining the language of a draft proposal for a student-faculty judiciary board that would hear academic dishonesty cases included as a part of what would be the College’s first honor code.
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will likely discuss the honor code again at their next meeting in April, with a potential vote on the proposed policy in May, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. The full Faculty most recently discussed the proposed honor code, outlined in a mid-January draft, at its meeting in February.
If the honor code were implemented as described in the mid-January draft, undergraduates would be required to sign a statement of integrity on major assignments and exams. Honor code violations—which involve academic integrity cases—would be heard by the proposed honor board, composed of half students and half faculty members and administrators.
A student-faculty judicial board was established by FAS in 1987 to hear cases “for which there is no clear precedent or consensus in the community about the impermissibility of the actions or the appropriate response,” according to the website of the Administrative Board, the College's primary disciplinary body. It has heard only one known case since it was established.
The authority to hear academic integrity cases would be largely transferred from the existing Ad Board to the proposed honor board, as described in the draft. As written, the dean of the College would have the authority to decide which body would hear cases that do not clearly fall under either’s jurisdiction.
At the beginning of the semester, members of the Academic Integrity Committee hosted a series of student feedback sessions in the Houses and the Yard regarding the draft. At those meetings, some undergraduates raised concerns about the proposed honor board, questioning how students would be selected for membership and whether or not students should be able to choose which administrative body would hear their case.
Sietse K. Goffard '15, who sits on the larger Academic Integrity Committee but is not part of the smaller group of members refining the honor board language, said in a phone interview Monday that he “truly believe[s]” that the honor board is a “necessary component” of the proposed honor code.
“The honor board is really the community enforcement mechanism” of the honor code, said Goffard, who is also vice president of the Undergraduate Council.

The March meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, originally scheduled to take place Tuesday, was cancelled last week because of “insufficient business ready for action,” according to a notice from the Faculty Docket Committee, the body responsible for creating the meeting’s agenda.
Faculty meetings—generally held on the first Tuesday of each month that classes are in session—feature votes on faculty policy, discussions of proposals and FAS affairs, and question-and-answer sessions in which professors may address administrators.
The cancellation is the first since the 2011-2012 academic year, when two meetings were omitted, according to Secretary of the Faculty Susan L. Lively. She said that cancellations are not uncommon.
According to the rules of Faculty procedure, if “no business is in need of immediate action” then “the Dean of the Faculty, with the approval of the Faculty Council, may omit any regular meeting.”
At last Wednesday’s Faculty Council meeting, the Docket Committee, which is chaired by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, “suggested that there was not enough business to fill the agenda for the scheduled March 4 meeting,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email. As a result, he said, the Council voted to cancel.
The Council also voted to change the name of the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentration to Integrative Biology. In addition, members heard a presentation on the University’s financial status as well as a report from the Committee to Study the Faculty Council Election Procedures.
Sociology professor Christopher Winship, vice-chair of the Docket Committee, wrote in an email that “It would be a mistake to have faculty meetings if there weren’t significant issues and work to be done.”
“Business tends to pile up toward the end of the year as committees finish their reviews and proposals,” computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, former dean of the College, wrote in an email, explaining why a meeting cancellation in March was not out of the ordinary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
As part of a new initiative to provide funding directly for events related to the bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer community on campus, the Queer Advisory Council made public on Feb. 28 the list of 12 campus activities that will be receiving grants this spring cycle.
The awarding of grants this term marks the conclusion of the first year that the Office of BGLTQ Student Life has supported BGLTQ-related events through a grant process. Prior to last fall, when the Queer Advisory Council was founded, students had to directly request funds from the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, which opened only two years ago.
Five campus organizations—including the Harvard College Queer Student and Allies, The Harvard Advocate, and The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club—received a total of $2,806 in grants from the Queer Advisory Council.
“It is incredible that in our first year we have been able to support 22 different programs,” said Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, the co-chair of the Queer Advisory Council, in reference to the total number of programs the Queer Advisory Council has funded since it was established. “There is a huge audience who can now engage with the Office [of BGLTQ Student Life].”
Blecher-Cohen said that he was especially happy about the diversity of activities funded, which includes both events that specifically address queer life on campus and events that only touch on topics relevant to the queer community. For example, the Queer Advisory Council financed the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of the play “Angels in America,” which takes place during the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s, although the club itself is not an explicitly BGLTQ group.
W. Powell Eddins ’16, co-chair of the QSA, one of the largest queer student organizations at the College, said the money awarded by the Council is a substantial amount of money for the queer community on campus.
“We were very excited, very elated [to get funding],” he said, adding that that the grant from the Queer Advisory Council is particularly important to the QSA because of the group’s funding policy.
“Our policy is that every event must be fully funded,” Eddins said. “We don’t do any fundraising ourselves.”
In previous years, the QSA has received most of its funding from the Harvard College Women’s Center, the Harvard Foundation, the Undergraduate Council, and occasionally the Harvard Gender and Sexuality Caucus for larger events.
The grants made available last Friday brings the total amount of funding disbursed by the Queer Advisory Council to $5,195 this year, a little more than half of the total amount student organizations requested from the Council during the 2013-2014 year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Leaders in the field of nuclear security argued that the American public could play a greater role in bringing more attention to national security issues at a panel at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Monday.
The panelists included Laura Holgate, a senior director at the National Security Council, and Matthew G. Bunn, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. Samantha Pitts-Kiefer, a senior program officer at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, also joined the panel virtually from Washington, D.C.
The panelists agreed that high-level politicians pay more attention to issues voters tend to focus on, such as climate change and health care, rather than nuclear security, which was too often filed away as a “technocratic problem,” Holgate said.
The event was held in anticipation of the Nuclear Security Summit 2014, which will be held in The Hague on March 24-25 and is the last such summit of President Barack Obama’s term.
Gary S. Samore, the executive director of research at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and the moderator of the event, also devoted a significant portion of the forum to questions from the audience.
In reference to a question about U.S. involvement in the domestic security issues of other nations, Bunn lauded the the security arrangements made recently with Russia.
“We have destroyed 20,000 bombs’ worth of Russian high-grade uranium over the course of the last 20 years,” Bunn said. “One out of ten American light bulbs was actually being powered by materials from dismantled Russian nuclear bombs.”
Peter S. S. Y. Wu ’16, who attended the event, said he thought the main takeaway from the panel was that nuclear security was a vital issue for both the domestic and the international community, although he added that national security was unlike “health care, your jobs, economic security, which are always in the back of your mind.”
Martin B. Malin, the executive director of Project on Managing the Atom at the Belfer Center, said he thought the panelists did a good job of describing the problems of nuclear terrorism and the difficulties involved in solving them.
“We have sitting here the architects of this entire process of summit for countries focused on securing their nuclear weapons and nuclear materials,” Malin said, referring to the expertise of the panelists.
Though the panelists said that much work needed to be done in the intersection between nuclear terrorism and national security, Holgate said catastrophic terrorists will always pose a threat to our nation.
 “The spread of technology and the spread of knowledge also mean that terrorists’ capability will continue to grow,” Holgate said. “The only determinant in this equation is that states have control over is the opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: March 4, 2014, at 3:09 a.m.
As the political crisis in Ukraine continues, Harvard affiliates have voiced concern over what one professor called Russia’s “naked aggression” in the situation, though many remain optimistic about possible U.S. intervention.
After months of protests, former Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovych was removed from office on Feb. 22, a day after agreeing to form a new government in Kiev. Yanukovich’s subsequent retreat to Russia allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to step up military forces in Crimea, a region of Ukraine with a Russian majority and many Russian military bases.
Serhii Plokhii, a professor of Ukrainian history and the director of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, said that he was surprised by Russia’s increased military presence in the region.
“The mood earlier in the week was that Russia could help stabilize Ukraine,” Plokhii said. “What we got instead was Russian occupation and intervention.”
George G. Grabowicz, a professor of Ukrainian literature, characterized Russia's actions as "naked aggression" that highlights the nation’s larger political agenda.
“This is an attempt to preserve the Soviet Union,” Grabowicz said.
While expressing uncertainty about what the future may hold for Ukraine, Grabowicz said that the country’s situation could potentially worsen.
“The worst possible scenario is outright war between Russia and Ukraine,” he said. “No state wants to be treated as an administration that has no control over its own territory. Ukraine does have an army, and they have said they will not retreat from their border posts.”
Nadiya V. Kravets, a postdoctoral fellow at the Ukrainian Research Institute, acknowledged these possible threats, yet said she hopes that Ukraine will emerge as a stronger democracy from the crisis.
“The country has had very difficult transitions since independence in 1991,” she said. “I hope now Ukraine will be a state that allows people to determine their own lives.”
Many Harvard affiliates agreed that the U.S. could play a potentially important role in solving the crisis. Scholars like Grabowicz have been optimistic about recent proposals from the U.S., which include an economic aid package of at least $1 billion and sanctions against Russian officials engaging in the military deadlock.
“I very much favor the notion of an aid package because it’s a strategic investment,” Grabowicz said. “If we mean what we say about supporting democracy and the rule of law, then this is an investment that will eventually pay itself.”
Thomas W. Simons, a lecturer at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies and a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and Pakistan, said that the U.S. can cooperate with the international community to dissuade Russia from escalating its involvement in the crisis.
“It’s important not to underestimate Russia’s sensitivity to world opinion,” he said. “Nothing we do individually will roll Russia back, but mobilizing international opinion in order to get Russia to refrain from using military force abroad is a big goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The temperature may have been frigid, but that didn’t stop the No. 11 Harvard women’s rugby team from heating up on Cumnock Field Saturday afternoon.
 
Seeing its first action since November, the Crimson (6-2) picked up its spring schedule right where it left off in the fall with a 22-5 win over West Chester University (5-3).
 
“It’s a great step in the right direction for us,” coach Sue Parker said. “I think what we saw in terms of our own self-assessment on the team was the ability to adjust and improve in the context of an extremely hard-fought battle. I’m extremely encouraged with what this team is going to accomplish over the course of the spring season.”
 
Harvard, which will finish its inaugural varsity season this semester, faced a stiff test from the Golden Rams, the second longest-standing varsity squad in the country.
 
It was a close-knit contest during the start of the first period, with neither team pressing the ball much past midfield. Ten minutes into the contest, senior Shelby Lin broke away from the pack and pushed the Crimson offense well past the midline, giving Harvard its first quality scoring opportunity of the contest. Moments later, the Crimson converted the try, and Lin split the posts on her conversion attempt to put Harvard up, 7-0.
 
But West Chester quickly responded, going deep into Harvard territory. The Crimson held strong for a few minutes but could not prevent the eventual score, as the Rams ran it in the back right corner for a try of its own. But a missed conversion attempt held the score at 7-5.
 
In the final moments of the first half, Harvard came up with an important stop, as West Chester spent the final seconds of the period just feet in front of the try zone. Time ran out, and the Crimson escaped with the two-point lead after the first 30 minutes of play.
 
“We knew it would be a tough West Chester team,” Parker said. “It took us the first 30 minutes to shake the rust off of the four-month layoff and get ourselves organized around ball retention around the rucks and the tackles. After we did that, we were able to employ our game plan.”
Heading into the second period, Parker emphasized the need for Harvard to execute its passes and tackles, even in the cold temperatures.
“[We needed to] get over the fear of that contact piece of the game,” Parker said. “In the first period, [it was] a total mess anytime around a tackle. In the second period, they started to execute.”
Despite pressure at both ends of the field, neither side could capitalize on its offensive opportunities for much of the second period. A kick attempt by West Chester went awry eight minutes into the period. A few minutes later, junior Cheta Emba broke away and darted past the Rams line into the try zone. Attempting to position the ball for a better look at the conversion, Emba stepped out of the back of the try zone before touching the ball to the ground, and her score was waved off.
 
But the Crimson finally put more points on the board when co-captain Xanni Brown ran in a try with four minutes left in the period to extend Harvard’s lead to 12-5. The Crimson added another score in the final minutes to close out a 17-5 win.
 
“Today was a really good day for a lot of things,” Brown said. “We got to see a lot of players play. We got to get our first taste of rugby for the spring. I think there are a lot of ways in which we are still dipping our toes in, but there were some things that went really well.  We brought a lot of intensity.”
 
After the first 60 minutes of play, both teams fielded their B-side lineups for a 30-minute scrimmage, giving novice players some on-field action.
 
Brown said that the win against West Chester will give Harvard confidence as it continues on its spring schedule, with home games against American International College and Boston College lined up in the coming weeks, all in preparation for the national championships at the end of April.
 
“This is our first non-Ivy League game since the beginning of the fall,” Brown said. “This is us making a statement hopefully outside of the Ivy League. That’s where we have our eyes set on competing. It’s good to come out here and get a win against a good regional team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In the Harvard baseball team’s first games of its spring season, late-game lapses led to four straight losses. The confines of the J.L. Johnson Stadium in Tulsa, Okla. were not friendly to the Crimson (0-4) in its series against Oral Roberts, as Harvard lost all four by a total of six runs.
“We were three innings away [in each of the games] from being 4-0,” said junior right fielder Brandon Kregel. “I think this weekend was more of a learning experience because we have the talent, witout a doubt. If you go through the box score, we were up [late], and I think…we just crashed a bit mentally.”
The Crimson’s trip to Oral Roberts (5-6) was the first meeting between the squads in the programs’ histories.“Oklahoma was a great place to open up [the season],” Kregel said. “Oral Roberts is one of the better teams in college baseball, so it was a nice experience to play against them, and we hung with them every single game.”
ORAL ROBERTS 6, HARVARD 5
Harvard suffered another one-run loss in the final matchup of the four-game set. Defensive woes sent the Crimson back to Cambridge still looking for its first win.
Led by senior second baseman Kyle Larrow’s trio of hits and Kregel’s three walks, the Harvard offense managed 12 hits and drew five walks against five Golden Eagle pitchers, while senior starter Sam Dodge threw six innings and struck out four for the Crimson.
But the Harvard defense had three errors in the game, and a balk by losing pitcher Zack Olson in the bottom of the eighth gave Oral Roberts a 6-4 lead heading into the ninth. In the second half of the frame, the Crimson nearly pulled off a rally, but fell just short again. Kregel slapped an RBI single to left to pull within one. Kregel advanced to scoring position on a wild pitch, but junior designated hitter Ethan Ferreira and Dill struck out to end the game, stranding the tying and go-ahead runs on base.
ORAL ROBERTS 5, HARVARD 3
Saturday was a new day, but the results of the second doubleheader were a similar story.Both sides’ bats were quiet until late in the game, with Harvard freshman right-hander Nick Gruener striking out six and walking none. He lasted seven and two-thirds innings on the mound in his first collegiate appearance.
From the opposite dugout, Oral Roberts’ Gavin Glanz matched him with a seven-plus inning quality start of his own.
“I was pretty excited about [getting to start] after we’ve been training for six months now,” Gruener said. “To have the opportunity to start one of the first four games as a freshman was pretty huge. It was unfortunate that we lost, but I thought as a team we pushed hard.”
In its half of the eighth, the Crimson took advantage of three Golden Eagles errors, scoring three runs—two unearned—and taking a 3-1 lead heading into the bottom of the inning. But once again, finishing the game strong turned out to be the Achilles heel for Harvard.
Still in the game, Gruener gave up a single and a two-bagger to cut the Crimson lead to one before giving way to junior right-hander Matt Timoney. For the second straight day, the junior right-hander was unable to shut the door, walking Brandy and then giving up a two-run triple to clean-up Oral Roberts hitter Jose Trevino.
Freshman Greg Coman took over for Harvard, and gave up another triple to make the score 5-3 in favor of the home squad. The Crimson had two hits by Larrow and junior outfielder Jack Colton to bring junior outfielder Mike Martin to the plate in the top of the ninth, but Martin grounded into a 5-4-3 double play to end the rally and the game.
ORAL ROBERTS 4, HARVARD 3
Looking to bounce back after a tough first loss, the Crimson dug itself a 3-0 deficit by the end of the third inning. Harvard junior starting pitcher Tanner Anderson gave up four hits in the first two innings, but only one thereafter in his six innings of work.
The Crimson got one run back in the fourth on a fielder’s choice from the bat of freshman first baseman Matt Hink. Both teams traded goose eggs on the scoreboard for the next three frames before Harvard finally started a rally in the top of the eighth.
First, Martin legged out an infield single, and stole second. After a walk to Kregel, Martin scored and Kregel advanced to third off a wild pitch. Junior catcher Steve Dill laced a single to center to score Kregel and knot the score at 3.
But Oral Roberts took the lead for good in the bottom half of the eighth off a balk by senior reliever Danny Moskovits. Harvard put the tying and go-ahead runs on base in the ninth, but Kregel struck out swinging to seal the 4-3 win for the Golden Eagles.
ORAL ROBERTS 6, HARVARD 4
Harvard squandered a strong first start by sophomore right-hander Sean Poppen to kick off the 2014 season. The Chesapeake, Va. native threw six-plus innings and gave up three earned runs on six hits.
After Poppen walked the first batter of the bottom of the seventh, Harvard coach Bill Decker handed the ball to Timoney to close the inning. But two of the three Golden Eagles batters Timoney faced reached base on errors. The second error loaded the bases for Oral Roberts’ Matt Brandy, who promptly banged a bases-clearing double off Crimson sophomore T.J. Laurisch, who had just taken over on the hill.
Oral Roberts’ two-run lead stood for the final two frames, and the Crimson suffered a loss in its first game of the season.
“The hitters competed all four games and got us the runs we needed,” Gruener said. “Moving forward, [we] need to be able to finish games off, and have our bullpen come out and finish games off for us. Once we get that down, I think we’ll be a pretty dominant team.”

The Harvard men’s hockey team split the final two games of its regular season over the weekend to finish second-to-last in both the ECAC and the Ivy League. On Friday, the Crimson edged out No. 16/15 Colgate, 2-1, in Hamilton, N.Y., before ceding a two-goal advantage on Saturday, losing in the final minute of overtime at No. 11/11 Cornell, 3-2.
 
The results set up a first-round postseason matchup next weekend in New Haven, where Harvard (10-15-4, 6-12-4 ECAC) will face the defending national champion Yale Bulldogs (15-9-5, 10-8-4) in a best-of-three series.
 
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 2 (OT)
 
Like the fish that the Lynah Rink faithful threw on the ice before the game, the Crimson was reeled in after a quick start in Ithaca, N.Y., Saturday night. Cornell junior forward Joel Lowry put back a rebound to complete a Big Red comeback from two goals down with 36 seconds to go in the extra frame.
 
“I feel bad for our guys because I feel they worked very hard and did a lot of good things in a very hostile environment,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91.
 
Harvard started quickly, racing out to a 2-0 lead with power play goals from freshmen centers Sean Malone and Alex Kerfoot in the first two frames.
 
A charging penalty from Lowry put the visitors on the man advantage one minute into the contest. Malone converted on a low crossing feed from sophomore linemate Brian Hart to beat Cornell senior goaltender Andy Iles on the right side of the crease for the game’s first goal.
 
Harvard struck on the man advantage again 11 minutes into the second period. This time, sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo set up Kerfoot from the left wing for a one-timer in the slot that caught Iles on the wrong side of the net.
 
Cornell drew even before the second intermission with goals from junior forward John McCarron at 12:46 and Matt Buckles at 17:18. Outshot by wide margins in the first and third frames, the Crimson received another strong outing from sophomore goaltender Steve Michalek, who made 32 saves.
 
After a scoreless third period in which the Big Red outshot the visitors, 10-5, Harvard had the better of the opportunities to open the extra period, but a wraparound attempt from junior Cornell forward Cole Bardreau with under a minute to play set up Lowry for the game-winning rebound.
 
“Playing at Cornell is always really exciting, a lot of emotion on both sides, the crowd was really into it,” captain Dan Ford said. “Obviously losing in overtime for us is kind of tough to swallow…. But the game itself was really exciting and a fun game to play in.”
 
Starting sophomore defenseman Patrick McNally sat out with an upper body injury for the fourth straight game Saturday but will likely return for next weekend’s action.
 
HARVARD 2, COLGATE 1
 
Goals from senior defender Danny Fick and freshman forward Phil Zielonka propelled Harvard to a 2-1 victory at Colgate (16-12-5, 12-6-3) in the penultimate game of its regular season.
 
“It was an excellent road win,” Donato said. “We did a lot of little things right.”
 
After a scoreless second period, Zielonka broke a 1-1 stalemate less than seven minutes into the final frame of regulation. After receiving a redirected Colgate clearing attempt from sophomore linemate Greg Gozzo, Zielonka split the legs of freshman defender Brett Corkey and beat rookie goaltender Charlie Finn glove-side with a high wrist shot from just inside the right faceoff circle.
 
The Raiders got on the board first with a power play marker from sophomore forward Murphy Darcy with seven and a half minutes left in the opening period. Minutes later, Harvard failed to find the back of the net on an extended 5-on-3 opportunity after Colgate was whistled for consecutive penalties 36 seconds apart.
 
The Crimson’s tying response came from the unlikeliest of its skaters. With just over two minutes left in the first period, Fick rushed the Colgate crease and batted a crossing feed from freshman forward Luke Esposito out of the air and past Finn for the senior defender’s first career goal in 93 collegiate games. Fick's strike ended a streak of 33 straight goals scored by Crimson underclassmen.
 
“[Fick] made a great play to really drive the net hard,” Ford said. “Everyone was really excited for him personally and also because it was such a great play against a good Colgate team to tie the game back up for us.”
 
Colgate outshot Harvard, 9-2, in the third period, but Michalek finished with 33 saves to collect his fifth win of the season. The victory was the Crimson's first road win over the Raiders since 2006.

Returning home after playing its first two games of the season in California, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team fought through in-game adversity to come out victorious in its home opener.
 
The Crimson (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) faced off against Cornell (1-1, 0-1) at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium on Saturday afternoon to open the season’s conference play. This is the first time in three years that Harvard has been able to defeat the Big Red.
 
The matchups was tight throughout, with no team leading by more than two goals until the last 30 seconds of the match, when freshman midfielder Maeve McMahon scored for her third time on the day with 18 seconds left to seal the Crimson’s 10-7 victory.
 
“It came down to the last 20 seconds or so and the defender came out,” McMahon said. “I saw [freshman] Megan [Hennessey] was matched up with her and had the ball. I kind of just snuck up the middle there and she fed me a great pass that I put into the net.”
 
It took some time for Harvard to mesh offensively, going down 3-2 early in the first half. Sophomore midfielder Audrey Todd tied the game with help from freshman attacker Marisa Romeo and senior attacker Kylie Keating put the Crimson ahead on an assist from Todd.
 
The Big Red maintained its lead and went ahead at halftime by scoring twice and shutting out Harvard for the remainder of the half.
 
“We were a little timid to start with, but I’m pleased with the way we gutted it out and the way we fought back and the way we sort of got more aggressive as the game went on,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “I saw some great things in we got tougher and more determined as the game went on and made plays when we had to.”
 
The Crimson sticks came alive in the second half, scoring goals on back-to-back drives to go up 7-6. Sophomore attacker Alexis Nicolia scored on a well-executed spin move to tie the game at six and Romeo followed up with an unassisted goal that put Harvard ahead.
 
Defense was also a strong suit in the second half for the Crimson, giving up only one goal in the final 30 minutes of play. Throughout the entire game Harvard was able to pressure the Big Red into committing 13 turnovers while giving the ball away eight times.
 
“I think transition in the midfield is a big part of what helped us in the second half,” McMahon said. “It helped us move the ball well and got the ball to the outside. We also got some big stops on the defensive end that helped us get momentum.”
 
Sophomore Kelly Weis got the start in goal for the Crimson and made nine saves in the net. Harvard outshot Cornell 26-25 during the match, with Big Red goalie Renee Poullott making seven saves in goal. The Crimson tailed its opponent in ground balls and draw controls, however, with 14 (to 15) and eight (to 11) respectively.
 
McMahon recorded the first of her career in the victory. McMahon and senior attacker Chloe Soukas had two draw controls each and sophomore attacker Amelia Capone had two ground balls and caused two turnovers.
 
“[We told the girls to] be assertive, be aggressive and not be afraid to make a mistake,” Miller said. “I think we’re at our best when we’re playing with speed and we’re aggressive. We’re young so I think there a bit that we’re feeling our way through it but I think we’re better when we’re trying to play at tempo.”
 
So far this season, McMahon and Romeo have been integral parts to Harvard’s offense, scoring a combined 15 goals in the first three games of their college lacrosse careers. Romeo leads the team with nine goals and 12 points in her rookie season.
 
“The biggest adjustment from high school to college is that everything is a little more sophisticated and the game moves faster,” Miller said. “Freshmen need to adjust to the tempo and I think there’s a need for a little bit more control. In high school if you’re the best player you have the ball and you run past people where in college there’s a lot more teamwork.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s time to take out the brooms as the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team joined the women’s team as Ivy League Champions. In front of a home crowd at Blodgett Pool, claimed the title as top of the Ancient Eight.
Coming off last weekend’s title-winning victory at Brown for the women’s team, the pressure was on for the men’s team. Having already captured the dual meet title, the Crimson knew it had a strong chance at claiming the crown.
“Seeing [the women] win was definitely exciting and definitely helps motivate us a little bit to win the meet,” co-captain Oliver Lee said.
And so Harvard rose to the occasion. Spoiling Princeton’s five-year conference title-winning streak, the Crimson was able to compete in front of family and friends as it claimed its 23rd Ivy League Championship, and first since 2008. The Crimson finished with 1495 points, while the Tigers trailed in second, 82 points behind the leaders.
“It was awesome to win at home with the fans there in our home pool,” Lee said. “It was so much more fun and so exciting, especially having lost by five points our freshman year. It was nice redemption.”
Harvard started off strong, gaining 56 points in the first event of the first day of competition as the 200 freestyle relay composed of junior Griffin Schumacher, senior Oliver Lee, senior Danny Crigler, and senior Chris Satterthwaite touched the wall first with a time of 1:18.30, setting the first of seven pool records over the weekend.
Finishing day one of competition, Harvard held a 105-point lead over Princeton, their main competition in contention for the title, with Penn and Yale hanging on in the third and fourth place slots.
Saturday’s races allowed the Crimson to show off its depth. Though there weren’t as many medals claimed by Harvard on day two, strong performances from all over the team, and from Satterthwaite in particular, allowed the Crimson to maintain an 82-point lead over the Tigers.
“Every person on our team did their part to ensure we won the championship,” freshman Eric Ronda said.
On the final day of competition, the Crimson added four event victories to their tally to solidify their claim to the title. Junior Mike Mosca continued to dominate the diving board, as he topped the podium with a score of 409.50 in the 3-meter competition, while senior Joe Zarrella took third in the event. After having won the 1-meter event on the first day of competition, Mosca swept the two events for the second consecutive year at the championship meet. He became only the seventh diver in conference history to sweep both events in multiple title meets. He was named Diver of the Meet after earning a total of 64 points.
In his last meet at home at Blodgett, Satterthwaite dominated each of the three days, capping off a strong senior campaign. The co-captain consistently left swimmers in his wake, capturing individual titles in the 200 freestyle and the 100 freestyle. As the anchor leg, he also was a member of the victorious 200, 400, and 800 freestyle relays and the 400 medley relay.
Though Satterthwaite led the charge, the rookies of the team played a huge role in the team’s victory. Freshman Jack Manchester claimed the win in the 200 backstroke as he swam to a new meet and pool record with his NCAA ‘B’ cut time. Classmate Ronda earned points for the team as he took second in the 100 breaststroke and the 200 breaststroke. Though he was unable to overtake Dartmouth senior Nejc Zupan, the freshman had his fastest swim of the season and broke the pool record by almost two seconds.
“Our freshman swam really well,” Lee said. “[They] really just stepped up big and swam really well which is great.”
In a parallel of superlatives, the meet started with a relay win and ended on the same note. With a pool record and more than a one second lead over their closest competitor, Schumacher, Lee, Manchester, and Satterthwaite sealed the meet victory in the 400 freestyle relay.
Though the swimmers were proud of their individual accomplishments, they knew the most important thing was to reclaim the Ivy title, which had eluded them for the past six years.
“Our goal was to win the meet, and we did it.” Ronda said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Coming off back-to-back home losses against Princeton and Penn last weekend, the Harvard women’s basketball team (19-7, 9-3 Ivy) could not afford to lose on its final Ivy League road trip of the season. The team climbed out of deficits on Friday and Saturday in battling back against Cornell (14-12, 6-6) and Columbia (6-20, 3-9) to complete the weekend sweep.
 
“We had two bad starts, unfortunately for us,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “But again I think it’s your classic underdog mentality, which makes the league so competitive. I loved our teamwork. I loved that we made game adjustments, and possession by possession, we were able to climb back in it.”
 
HARVARD 64, COLUMBIA 51
 
On Saturday night, the story was junior forward Temi Fagbenle. She finished the game with a career-best 31 points and 18 rebounds as she carried the Crimson offense to a decisive 64-51 win over the Lions.
 
“As a rebounder, [Fagbenle] did it from the low-post and [she] did it from the mid-range,” Delaney-Smith said. “This must have been one of her best performances tonight. I loved how she played."
 
After jumping out to an early lead, Harvard surrendered 13 points to fall behind for the second night in a row. Sophomore guard Kit Metoyer halted Columbia’s run with a three-pointer, and then Fagbenle took over the Crimson offense. The London, England native scored 23 of the team’s 26 first-half points, keeping Harvard within three points by the close of the first half.
 
“My teammates did a great job getting the ball in and trusting that I would be able to score or pass it out,” Fagbenle said. “It was working throughout the whole game, so we didn’t change it.”
 
Harvard went on a 9-0 run early in the second half to retake the lead, 37-34, for the first time since the opening two minutes of the game. Upon grabbing the advantage, the Crimson stayed in command, outscoring the Lions 38-22 in the second half en route to a 64-51 win.
 
The difference in the game came down to points in the paint, with Harvard stacking up 26 in comparison to Columbia’s 12. 
The win marked number 514 for Delaney-Smith’s career, tying her with Pete Carril for most wins as an Ivy League coach.
 
HARVARD 70, CORNELL 66
 
Down by 15 in the first half, the Crimson faced an uphill battle against Cornell as it tried to avoid its third consecutive loss. The early deficit did not intimidate Harvard, as the team rallied back in the first half and held on in the second to record its biggest comeback win in five seasons.
 
With 10:43 to go before halftime, the Big Red was able to capitalize on a string of Crimson turnovers to jump out to a 23-8 lead.
 
The early deficit did not intimidate Harvard as the team responded just minutes later with 14 unanswered points. During this stretch, co-captain Christine Clark scored eight points, including a shot from beyond the arc that gave the Crimson back the lead for the first time since the opening minute.
 
“[We play with] the mentality that the game isn’t over until it’s over,” Fagbenle said. “Whether we are up or down, we still try to come out with the same aggressiveness and hustle on the floor. It doesn’t really matter what the score is.”
 
The Crimson outscored Cornell by 20 points in the last ten minutes before the break to take a five-point lead, 35-30, into the second half.
 
Clark paced the Harvard offense with 18 points and seven rebounds on the night. Fagbenle recorded 12 points and seven rebounds, while senior center Elise Gordon contributed 11 points off the bench.
 
The Crimson kept the momentum early in the second half. With three unanswered baskets coming out of halftime, Harvard had its first double-digit lead of the night. The team continued its offensive surge and gained a 20-point lead, 60-40, as a Fagbenle’s lay-up capped another 8-0 scoring run.
 
But Cornell responded with a 16-0 scoring run of its own, holding the Crimson scoreless for over six minutes of play. Turnovers once again proved costly down the stretch for Harvard as the team coughed up the ball five times during the Big Red’s streak. This surge brought Cornell within four with just under a minute left to play, but the last-minute push was not enough to close the gap. Eight points from the charity stripe in the final minute of the game helped the Crimson hold on for the win, 70-66.
 
The Big Red’s senior forward Allyson DiMagno finished with a 10 points and 14 rebounds, while freshman forward Nia Marshall and senior guard Stephanie Long led the Big Red in scoring with 13 points apiece.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Harvard has another banner to raise as the women’s track and field team took the top spot at this weekend’s Heptagonal Invitational, making the Crimson Ivy League Champions for the second year in a row. With the men’s third place finish, Harvard earned the right to call itself the top combined track and field program in the Ivy League.
 
“This was probably the highest energy meet we’ve been to so far because we are all so close and it was really anyone’s game, “ freshman Nikki Okwelogu said.
 
Both the men and women’s programs posted personal highs in point totals. The men earned 95 points during the two days of competition, its highest Heps point total since 1985. Meanwhile, the women earned 122 points, the most in program history.
 
The Crimson women beat out host school Dartmouth, who finished in second with 105 points, followed by Columbia in third with 95 points. The men fell third behind title winner Cornell (145 points) and second-place Princeton (117 points).
 
“I was thrilled,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “I thought our men and women competed fantastically. I was really proud of their efforts. It was by far the best performance this program has seen in a long, long time.”
 
It was Harvard’s depth that kept it in contention all weekend. Despite the fact the women grabbed the top spot in only four events, compared to runner-up Dartmouth’s seven first place finishes, the Crimson still defeated the Big Green by 20 points. Overall, Darmouth had 11 scorers register a point in track events, while Harvard had 15 to take the edge. In the field, the Big Green had only four point scorers compared to the Crimson’s five.
 
“Every point matters. Every point adds up,” Saretsky said. “It can be the difference, and we just had a really fantastic meet.”
 
The records continued to fall for the women, as they have all season. Junior Danielle Barbian was leading the charge as she competed in the 60-meter dash on Saturday and Sunday. In the first day of competition on Saturday, she matched the Ivy League record and broke her own school record with a time of 7.45 seconds in the preliminary heats. Then on Sunday, she bested her own time and claimed sole possession of the Ivy League record with a time of 7.44 seconds.
 
Sophomore Autumne Franklin was a repeat victor in the 60-meter hurdle event. Though she failed to match her record set in her rookie season, Franklin was just 0.06 seconds off her meet best time.
 
Harvard showed off its strength in the field with the strong performances of senior captain Adabelle Ekechukwu and Okwelogu. The duo alone outscored the entire Dartmouth field team across the two days of competition.
 
Ekechukwu was named Most Outstanding Performer in the field after her performance in the weight throw, which she won with a distance of 20.81 meters, just 0.02 meters behind her own All-Time Ivy record, set in 2013.
 
“She’s just the best, “ Okwelogu said. “I was struggling at practice a few days before the meet… she really came up to me and gave me that last bit of ‘you can do this’ push. She just believes on every single person on the team… She’s one of us here to help whenever we need it.”
 
Okwelogu competed in the shot put, taking the top spot on the podium with a throw of 15.31. The toss made the rookie the first Crimson thrower to win the event since 1992 and the her score broke the Harvad shot put record set in 1991.
 
On the men’s side, it was the 5K event that proved most exciting as Harvard’s senior duo of James Leakos and Maks Korolev crossed the finish line in the gold and silver positions. Leakos just beat out Korolev by 0.16 seconds with a time of 13 minutes, 58.67 seconds. Korolev currently holds the school record in the 5K, with Leakos holding on to the second spot all-time.
 
The men also claimed the second and third spots in the 60m dash, with senior Damani Wilson beating out teammate senior Andrew Ezekoye for silver.
 
In the field, the Harvard men showed their depth in the weight throw, as junior Ben Glauser, freshman Josh Whitener, and senior Dustin Brode took second, third, and fourth respectively. The trio contributed 16 points for the Crimson in the event. Brode also finished second in the shot put with a personal best distance, and Freshman Andrew Roney was fifth in the pole vault to contribute to Harvard’s point total.
 
The teams return to competition next week in Boston with the ECAC and IC4A Championships.

The Harvard softball team played 46 innings in five games at the Louisiana State University Tournament this weekend en route to four wins, three of which came in extra innings.
 
The highlight of the weekend for the Crimson came on Friday afternoon with a 12-inning, 1-0 upset of No. 23 Louisiana State University (15-5). Harvard (6-4) added a win against Lamar (4-9) on Friday and a pair of wins against Jackson State (5-13) over the weekend, but fell to Iowa State on Saturday afternoon (14-5).
 
“Harvard softball has some lofty goals that we hope to accomplish this season, and beating a top-25 team, and an SEC team, is definitely right there in the mix,” said junior pitcher Laura Ricciardone, who had nine strikeouts in the win. “It was exciting for us to accomplish one of those goals and prove to ourselves that we have what it takes to be successful outside of the Ivy League.”
 
HARVARD 5, JACKSON STATE 4
 
A hit to second base off the bat of junior catcher Katherine Appelbe in the bottom of the 10th inning was all the Crimson needed to score junior designated hitter Andrea Del Conte and finish off the Tigers, 5-4.
 
After scoring a run in the second and third innings, the Crimson extended its lead to four with a pair of runs in the fourth. But Jackson State took advantage of three consecutive walks by freshman pitcher Taylor Cabe to score three runs without recording a single hit in the inning.
 
Harvard clung to its one-run lead until the Tigers’ final at-bat. Jackson State sophomore Canessa Swanson stole a pair of bases and then scored from third on a fielder’s choice to send the game into extra innings.
 
After failing to score with bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth, the Crimson came through in the 10th. Sophomore Morgan Groom pitched well in relief, striking out seven and holding Jackson State scoreless in the final innings to give Harvard for its third extra-inning win on the weekend.
 
IOWA STATE 4, HARVARD 2
 
The Cyclones jumped on the Crimson early as three consecutive singles gave the team a two-run lead before Harvard’s first at-bat.
 
The Crimson responded immediately in the bottom half of the inning as senior center fielder Shelbi Olson and senior third baseman Kasey Lange crossed the plate to tie the game at two.
 
Iowa State threatened again in the top of the second with three hits, but stranded all three runners on base. In the fifth, the Cyclones broke through by stringing together four singles to retake a two-run lead. Junior pitcher Katie Johnson, who held the Crimson offense to just three hits after the first, didn’t allow a run in the game’s last six innings.
 
HARVARD 4, JACKSTON STATE 2
 
Coming off an upset against LSU, the Crimson fell behind early as junior leftfielder Denisha Knight hit a home run in the first to give the Tigers a one-run lead. Jackson State struck again in the third when senior Tiger shortstop Lauren Aikens hit an RBI single to center.
 
Harvard responded with a four-run sixth inning that proved the difference in the game. Olson led off the inning with a double to right center, and scored later in the inning on a double from Lange. Junior shortstop Emily Gusse hit her second single of the day to score Lange and tie the game at two. The Crimson then took the lead after Del Conte knocked in a pair of runs with a single up the middle.
 
HARVARD 1, LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY 0
 
Ricciardone won a 12-inning pitching duel with LSU senior pitcher Ashley Czechner to carry the Crimson to its first win over a ranked opponent since its victory over Texas Tech in 2012. With the bases loaded in the bottom of the 12th inning, Ricciardone caught A.J. Andrews looking for the final out.
 
“Laura was on,” coach Jenny Allard said. “All of her pitches were working. She had great command of the zone. She was hitting her spots. She was just a warrior out there. She really stepped up when they had runners in scoring position. It was the best game I’ve seen her pitch in her Harvard career.”
 
Czechner held the Crimson to no runs through the first eleven innings. Harvard finally broke through in the top of the 12th when Gusse slapped a single up the middle to score Shelbi Olson from third.
 
HARVARD 3, LAMAR 1
 
With the score tied at one in the top of the 10th inning and a runner on second, freshman designated hitter Savannah Bradley came to the plate and smacked a homer to left field to power the Crimson to a 3-1 victory over Lamar.
 
Both teams were held scoreless through the first four innings of the game. The Cardinals struck first with a lone run in the fifth on a fielder’s choice that scored junior third baseman Casey Cromwell.
 
Harvard pushed the game to extras in its final opportunity. The team strung together three singles in the seventh to draw even and set up Hagberg’s winning hit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It finally got the wins when it counted the most.
After both losing and tying to Yale, the No. 5/5 Harvard women’s ice hockey team nearly saw its conference rivals end its season at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center this weekend.
After 241 minutes of game time, the Crimson (23-5-4, 13-3-2 ECAC) and its depleted roster of just 17 players skated away with one loss, 3-2, and two wins, 3-2 and 4-0, against the Bulldogs (9-26-7, 6-11-7) in the ECAC Tournament quarterfinals.
“I think we’ve been displaying some great hockey—both sides, Yale and Harvard,” said interim Harvard head coach Maura Crowell. “It’s kind of a track meet out there. Both sides are getting their chances, goalies are coming up big, and it’s a rollercoaster.”
With two contests rife with shots and sparse with goals, Friday and Saturday evenings saw a true battle of the goalkeepers. Yale junior Jaimie Leonoff defended her net to a total of 131 saves over the weekend. Harvard sophomore Emerance Maschmeyer tended the goal on Friday, while freshman Brianna Laing made the two most high-pressure starts of her career on Saturday and Sunday to extend the Crimson’s season. The rookie retained a 7-0-0 record for the season, and took the hits from Yale’s corps of talented forwards.
“All along we’ve said that we have the utmost confidence in Bri,” Crowell said. “[Saturday] obviously was her biggest [game] and she played great and showed she has ice in the veins and she’s a gamer. She gave us life today.”
HARVARD 4, YALE 0 
After two straight games of stalemates and tight play, Sunday afternoon could not have been more different. Nearly 13 periods of hockey after the best-of-three series began, the Crimson walked away with a shutout to earn its ticket to Potsdam, N.Y., where it will play top-seeded No. 3/3 Clarkson in the semifinals of the ECAC tournament.
While it took a period and a half on Friday and two and a half periods on Saturday for Harvard to score, just 5:30 elapsed on Sunday before junior forward Hillary Crowe nabbed an assist from sophomore forward Miye D’Oench, seizing an opening to drive the puck into the net from midrange. Leonoff, looking tired from the grueling series, could not react in time.
“You know, I think [Leonoff] played an impressive series,” D’Oench said. “We were pounding away and threw everything we had at her, and I think she did as well as she could have done this series. My hat’s off to her.”
Minutes later, senior forward Gina McDonald, perhaps skating for her final home game, bobbled the puck off the left pipe, which junior forward Sarah Edney recovered for a strike past the crease, 2-0. Crowe scored again, this time on a power play, six minutes into the third frame to widen Harvard’s lead to 3-0. An empty netter from sophomore Jessica Harvey sealed the win with 2:45 remaining.
HARVARD 3, YALE 2
It was déjà vu as the regulation clock ticked down on Saturday afternoon. After three periods, the score was still knotted at 2-2. Sophomore forward Dylanne Crugnale and D’Oench provided the scores for the Crimson against Leonoff.
After Yale freshman forward and Olympic Bronze medalist Phoebe Staenz put her team on the board first, it was D’Oench who countered with a tying tally a period later. When Staenz scored yet again, Crugnale responded nearly three minutes later. As a crowd gathered in front of the crease, the sophomore received an assist from Harvey and found an opening between the pipes.
The first overtime period saw the Crimson take several good looks at the goal, only to be swatted away by Leonoff. The goalie made 53 saves for the contest. Both 4-on-3 and 4-on-4 play proved fruitless, as Harvard was unable to capitalize on the day’s eight power play opportunities.
After 28 scoreless minutes, D’Oench struck gold with a game winner. Junior forward Samantha Reber fired off a feed to Crowe, whose shot attempt bounced back and into D’Oench’s path. The sophomore slipped it into the net and put the Crimson on top, 3-2. The crowd waited quietly while the goal went under review. It was deemed good, and Harvard kept its ECAC title hopes alive.
“I think it needed to happen,” D’Oench said. “Something needed to go our way. It was a lucky bounce and we haven’t been getting a lot of those.”
YALE 3, HARVARD 2
Nearly two full games of hockey were played during Friday night’s nail-biter. After almost five full periods and nearly three and a half hours at Bright, it took just a split second to end things in Yale’s favor.
Bulldog sophomore Janelle Ferrara took advantage of tired legs and a waning second overtime period, tipping in the game winner for her team whilst on a power play. Yale had not appeared in the ECAC playoffs since 2008, and it was the team’s first postseason win since 2005.
Despite leading in shots on goal, 40-25, through regulation, Harvard could not find the decisive edge to take out the Bulldogs. With three minutes left in the contest, D’Oench brought the puck down the left side of the rink into Yale’s zone and chipped a pass to Reber, who was waiting on the other side of the post. Moments later, the junior tied up the game with a quick score.
The first period of golden goal overtime saw both squads fail to convert power plays into scores, while the second period showed more of the same—each team dispatched successful penalty kill units three times in extra minutes.
While the Crimson continually controlled the ice and fired off attack after attack, Leonoff proved nearly impenetrable in goal. Several times in the first period, Crowe broke Yale’s press to drive the puck forward, only to have Leonoff hurl herself forward and lie spread-eagle on the ice to prevent a score.
“Even though we didn’t come up with the win, I have no complaints about the effort [that our team] gave throughout 97 minutes of hockey,” Crowell said. “[Yale has] our number out there and they play us really hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second half proved to be the downfall for the Harvard women’s water polo team on Sunday afternoon, as the Crimson fell at the hands of No. 7 Princeton, 11-9, at DeNunzio Pool.
Harvard (7-3, 0-1 CWPA) managed only two goals in the second half after scoring seven in the first stanza on the road against the undefeated Tigers (11-0, 1-0).
After heading into halftime down 8-7, the Crimson kept the game close but never grabbed hold of the lead at any point during the final 16 minutes of play.
Perhaps the biggest difference-maker in the second half was Princeton’s sophomore goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson, who recorded 17 saves in the final three quarters after stopping zero shots in the first. Although the Crimson outshot the Tigers, 30 to 24, the team had a hard time getting it by Princeton’s netminder late in the game.
“[Johnson is] a very talented goalie,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “She made some good blocks.”
To explain the Crimson’s offensive struggles in the second half, junior co-captain Ariel Dukes pointed to a lack of aggression in creating chances.
“I think it came down to our movement,” Dukes said. “They did a great job of covering up, but I think we also could have done a better job of continuing our drives that worked so well in the first half.
After a power play goal from junior co-captain Shayna Price gave the Crimson a 6-4 advantage with 5:32 to play in the second quarter, Harvard allowed three goals in a 77 second span to fall behind by one. The sequence proved costly for the Crimson, as the Tigers never trailed for the rest of the game.
Princeton’s offense came alive during the second quarter and remained hot after the halftime break. The three-goal stretch was part of a 5-1 run for the Tigers, and Diana Murphy capped it off with an unassisted goal 51 seconds into the third quarter.
Murphy proved to be the catalyst in Princeton’s scoring barrage, netting four of her five goals during the pivotal run.
Price and sophomore Yoshi Anderson paced Harvard with three goals each, as both teams came out firing in a back-and-forth first quarter. Price struck first less than a minute into the game, and the period ended with the Crimson on top 5-4.
“I thought we did a good job of executing our offensive game plan,” Minnis said. “I was happy with the way we played overall.”
Though the day ultimately ended in a loss for Harvard, Dukes noted that the team never allowed the Tigers to take a commanding lead during the game, which was televised on ESPNU.
“I thought we came out with a lot of intensity,” Dukes said. “We know they’re a really good team, and even though we lost I was very proud of our effort throughout the game. I don’t think we ever let them run away with it; I thought we kept it close.”
The largest lead of the game for either team was two goals, as both squads continually answered each other’s scores throughout. During the second half, the Crimson never allowed Princeton to push its lead to three, answering the Tigers on two separate occasions to pull within one.
But Harvard could not muster a tying strike late in the game despite repeated attempts on goal.
“We just didn’t catch a break,” Minnis said. “We hit a couple posts, a couple bars down the stretch. [We] had some good looks but just didn’t finish.”
Freshmen Alexis Del Toro and Michelle Martinelli, along with sophomore Charlotte Hendrix, each scored a goal for the Crimson. Junior Victoria Frager added two assists, and Dukes registered six saves in goal for Harvard.
Both Dukes and Minnis noted that playing a close game against Princeton, a top national team, serves as a good learning experience and prepares the squad for future challenges. The Crimson will host three top-20 teams at Blodgett Pool this weekend.
“We know…we can play with anyone,” Dukes said. “So I think it’s a matter of taking that confidence and continuing to work on our practical application.”
“For us, its gaining confidence to be able to play against the top teams in the country,” Minnis added. “If we want to get to that point, we have to take away some things from [this game] and gain some confidence. I think we did that.”

By now, many of you have probably heard about “I, Too, Am Harvard”, a photography campaign inspired by an original play about the experiences of black students here at Harvard College. The campaign includes photographs of 63 black students, each holding a board sharing a racist remark made to or about them, or a message to their peers about the microaggressions they have faced both at Harvard and outside of it. The campaign has already been picked up by Buzzfeed and Colorlines, a news site that focuses on race.
The play that inspired the campaign, also called “I, Too, Am Harvard”, was written by Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ‘16. Created out of interviews Matsuda-Lawrence conducted last semester with 40 members of the black community on campus, the play will premiere this Friday as part of the 16th Annual Dr. Walter J. Leonard Black Arts Festival. A teaser trailer, created by Ahsante I. Bean ‘15, was released yesterday.
The play and photography campaign are hosted and sponsored by Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, and co-sponsored by a number of other student groups and organizations on campus, including the Black Students’ Association, Black Men’s Forum, the Association of Black Harvard Women, the Harvard African Students’ Association, Fuerza Latina, the Harvard Foundation, the Institute of Politics, and the Carr Center for Human Rights, among others.
Check out the campaign’s Tumblr to see all 63 photographs, and stop by their Facebook page for updates on the play, including photographs of the cast. There is also an active Twitter hashtag and account. The play premieres at 7 p.m. this Friday in Lowell Lecture Hall. Tickets are available for free from the Harvard Box Office with HUID.

“Most of what we do is fulfill other people’s expectations. You just have to meet them, and you win,” muses a young, female voice. “When what you expect of yourself changes, that’s when things get tricky.” 
 
The voice belongs to Harley, one of five fictional Harvard students to be profiled in the upcoming student-produced web series “IVY.” The series, created and directed—as well as co-written—by Eli Wilson Pelton ‘16, will explore “the intricacies and hilarity of the Ivy League experience” through the lens of five sophomore friends. To promote its upcoming pilot episode, “IVY” has released five short character sketches to give us a taste of what we can expect from the season premiere. In the short clips, friends Harley, Oliver, Luc, DK, and Layla can be seen happily yet pensively meandering together down Dewolfe Street, occasionally pausing to throw snowballs, smoke, and play with an Elmo balloon.
“Have you ever gone out swimming early in the morning? Not in a pool—actually swimming, in the ocean,” ponders Luc (whose parents picked a more artsy way of spelling “Luke”), as the camera alternately blurs and refocuses on his furry pink tiara. “The sun’s not out. The waves are choppy. It starts in your toes and moves its way up until, before you know it, you can’t feel anything. But you keep going, struggling stroke by stroke, to make the break.”
If the high production quality of these short clips are any indication, “IVY” promises to be exciting addition to the Harvard student-produced television landscape--perhaps the soul-searching HBO drama complement to On Harvard Time’s SNL-esque silliness. In the coming months, we can look forward to seeing how “IVY” will explore the archetype of the Harvard undergraduate bildungsroman from a refreshingly uncynical perspective.
Nearly a third of America’s colleges are test-optional, meaning that applicants have a choice whether or not to submit their SAT/ACT scores. Does this policy make their admission decisions less reliable? According to a recent study released by the National Association for College Admission Counseling, the answer is “No”.
The study, titled Defining Promise: Optional Standardized Testing Policies in American College and University Admissions, examined 33 test-optional private and public four-year institutions across the country. It found no significant differences in either college GPA or graduation rates between submitters and non-submitters. In fact, high school GPA, rather than SAT score, seems to be the more resilient and reliable predictor of college success.
“Does standardized testing produce valuable predictive results, or does it artificially truncate the pools of applicants who would succeed if they could be encouraged to apply?  At least based on this study, it is far more the latter,” the report says, “A clear message: hard work and good grades in high school matter, and they matter a lot.”
The study was led by William C. Hiss, a Harvard Divinity School alumnus who has served as Dean of Admissions and Vice President at Bates College.
“My guess is that high school GPA and college cumulative GPA are 2 four-year measures of qualities like self-discipline, intellectual curiosity, organization skills, drive, being part of a community… The qualities required to succeed in college are very similar to those required to succeed in high school,” Hiss said.
The research also found that “Non-submitters are more likely to be first-generation-to-college enrollees, all categories of minority students, women, Pell Grant recipients, and students with Learning Differences (LD).”
“Low-income students may experience financial barriers because they cannot afford expensive SAT coaching programs; students from rural areas may not have geographic access to these programs. Thus they might be less prepared to take the SATs,” Hiss explained.
Addressing the study’s implications for the nation’s most selective institutions like Harvard, Hiss said, “The biggest danger for Ivy League colleges is that extraordinary students don’t even apply because they are discouraged by their low SAT scores. These are students who have proved themselves to everyone except the testing agencies.” Furthermore, he emphasizes, the world of college admissions should take note of this study as testament to the fact that “ we are throwing away a significant part of our talents,” a practice that Hiss stresses we can ill afford.
