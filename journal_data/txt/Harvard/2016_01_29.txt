After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Woven deeply into the fabric of the American consciousness is the idea that anyone in America can succeed regardless of what you look like, where you were born, or who your parents are. There are few things that capture the American imagination quite like a good rags-to-riches story.
We like these stories because they reflect positively on our society. When someone from humble beginnings manages to make it in America through sheer hard work and natural aptitude, it’s an opportunity for us to feel validated about upward social mobility within our system.
However, I have noticed that rags-to-riches stories are also sometimes invoked in an effort to make invalid the real, structural barriers to success that those who are disadvantaged in our society face every day. If a person can go from poverty to prosperity in this land of equal opportunity, the argument goes, then poor people can only blame themselves for not working hard enough.
It troubles me deeply whenever individual success stories are employed to mask structural limitations on opportunity in our society. While it is true that there are many Americans who have succeeded through individual initiative despite starting life with numerous disadvantages, these success stories cannot justify the structural inequalities that exist in this country. The fact of the matter is, for every individual who rises out of poverty, there are many more who remain in poverty because their options in life have been structurally limited. 
In the United States, if a child is born black, Latino, or to a family of low socioeconomic status, it is more likely that that child will receive an inferior education, receive lower quality health care, and be treated more harshly in our criminal justice system. Even something as basic as the air that he or she will breathe is more likely to be so polluted that it will cause him or her to develop a serious illness.
Although structural inequalities continue to hold back many Americans, the good news is that we can do something about it. The level of inequality that exists in the United States today is not set in stone. Through our democratic system of government, we collectively hold the power to organize our society in a way that is more equal and more just. Indeed, we can give every child in this country a fairer shot at being all that they can be.
Giving every child a fairer shot in life means enabling our government to collect a fair share of taxes from the nation’s highest earners to improve assistance programs and ensure that no child in America goes hungry. It means regulating the financial industry to prevent the type of recklessness that plunged our economy less than a decade ago into a recession that hit the poorest Americans the hardest. It means regulating the amount of pollution that corporations can release into the environment so that no child dies from the air that she breathes. It means setting higher standards for what our public schools can do and restructuring school funding in a way that is equitable across neighborhoods of different socioeconomic status.
Unfortunately, there are some people in the United States today who would not like to see our government do any of these things to reduce inequality. Instead, they advocate for policies that favor the highest earners with the false promise that those earnings will produce a trickle-down effect beneficial to the middle and lower class. In truth, a closer look at how trickle-down policies have impacted our society reveals that these policies have done nothing but exacerbate inequality in America. 
From Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal that gave us Social Security to Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society that gave us Medicare, history shows that the government has an indispensable role to play in reducing societal inequality. Rather than reject the government, we should focus our collective energy on making it better. By embracing the spirit that made the New Deal and the Great Society possible, we can make our government more responsive to the needs of the most disadvantaged Americans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before the man was deposed, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi was roundly derided for ramrodding through a new constitution that would have, as his critics charged, made Egypt into an illiberal theocracy. Of special consternation was its second article, which declared that “Islam is the religion of the state and Arabic its official language. Principles of Islamic Sharia are the principal source of legislation.” But when Egypt’s next constitution, shepherded in by the military and ratified as Morsi stood trial, was found to contain nearly-identical language, the bells of discontent were not rung quite so loud.
Religious clauses in constitutions have abounded in Muslim countries, whether ruled by monarchs or mullahs, presidents or prime ministers, ever since Syria’s 1950 post-colonial constitution declared Islamic jurisprudence to be the basis for legislation. Over half the constitutions of Muslim-majority states today contain similar clauses that officially recognize Islam. The motivations and practical effects, if any, of these declarations have been hotly debated, but all agree that wording matters. Sharia can be described as “a principal source” of legislation or “the principal source”; Islam is either labeled as merely supreme or laws deemed repugnant to it are made explicitly invalid.
Are democracy and constitutional Islam at odds? It’s a complicated question, sure to be bandied about in the halls of the academy. But an empirical approach to this question can also be worthwhile. One helpful measure is the Islamic Constitutions Index, developed by the academics Dawood I. Ahmed and Moamen Gouda, which assesses the degree of Islamic endorsement by constitutions on a scale from zero to 30 based on the demands made on public morality, rights and legislation, and the judiciary.
Topping the chart, perhaps not unexpectedly, are regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia, the first a Shia theocratic quasi-democracy and the other a Sunni monarchy. But immediately following them are the Maldives and Pakistan, two democratically governed countries with moderate civil rights protections—not quite as renowned for morality police or punishments like amputation and beheading. Avowedly secular Turkey scores a zero, but so does Indonesia, the country with the world’s largest Muslim population.
Comparing the level of constitutional Islam for Muslim countries with other published indices for levels of freedom and democracy yields dispiriting results for proponents of constitutional Islam. On average, constitutions with higher measures of Islamic provisions in their constitutions are associated with worse scores in The Economist Intelligence Unit’s democracy index, Freedom House’s civil liberties ratings, the World Economic Forum’s gender gap index, and the Pew Research Foundation’s index of government restrictions on religion.
Meanwhile, Western nations were recently involved in rewriting the Iraqi and Afghani constitutions, both of which prominently enshrined the position of Islam. Does this analysis affirm the warning that “the elevation of Iranian-style theocrats,” as one critical academic put it at the time, would undo the democratic order?
Here, the familiar chiding about correlation and causation need be remembered. Between the high-minded sphere of constitutional design and actual, day-to-day impact on residents lies the apparatus of censors, judges, and policemen who modulate constitutional demands and translate them for the common man. What constitutions prescribe and what bureaucracies end up dealing out can be quite different. Though constitutionally secular, Indonesia has strong anti-blasphemy laws and government-sanctioned persecution against religious minorities.
Academics have also proposed explanations for these Islamic provisions that could complicate matters. So-called “repugnancy clauses,” which invalidate laws judged contradictory to Islam and are perhaps the strongest endorsements of religion, are thought to have originated with British rule of India, when the imperial government gave itself the power to overrule legislation “repugnant to the laws of England.” And it is often the relatively liberal regimes that introduce Islamist provisions, like Egyptian President Anwar Sadat did in the country’s 1971 constitution, probably in an attempt to consolidate power and legitimize themselves before conservatives.
Nonetheless, as the rash of revolution in the Middle East is sure to be followed by a rash of constitution drafting, it’s important to know the crowd-pleasers, like acknowledging Islam to be the religion of the state, from the more serious clauses that require all legislation or judicial decisions to have religious approval.
Imagine if Goldilocks were to go constitution-picking. She would settle on something not too theocratic, not too secular. In the Muslim world, that may be just right.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority appears set to cut late-night service because of its long-running budget difficulties, in spite of vocal opposition from community members, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, and other local officials. After the cuts, the T’s service would end at 12:30 a.m. instead of 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights.
The decision to cut late-night T service is regressive and deeply disappointing. Nighttime public transit is more than simply an issue of convenience for local residents. It is an issue of equity for people who live far away from their workplace, or whose commutes begin or end outside the T’s limited hours of operation.
Access to public transportation is a barrier to Boston’s becoming a world-class city. Opponents of the cuts argue that late-night public transportation service is crucial to making Boston a livelier city and allows for restaurants and other businesses to stay open later.
Under both Governors Deval L. Patrick '78 and Charlie D. Baker '79, the Commonwealth has taken steps to retool Boston's image as a 21st century magnet city for tech start-ups, universities, and young professionals. This effort has been paying off. In January, for example, General Electric announced that it would move its headquarters to Boston. Eliminating late-night T service makes this pitch harder, given the transit systems of other cities like New York’s subway, which runs 24 hours a day.
Supporters of the cuts, including the MBTA’s Fiscal Management and Control Board, note that the late-night subsidy is $13.38 per rider, compared to $1.43 for normal service. These budget concerns are real, and MBTA administrators face a raft of difficult choices. Its current operating deficit of $170 million is projected to reach $240 million next year. Long-run infrastructure outlays may cost billions, as aging infrastructure has to be maintained, replaced, or expanded.
But as Governor Baker pointed out in an open letter last May, resolving this long-term budget pinch will have everything to do with changes to the way the MBTA negotiates contracts and invests strategically in its infrastructure. In the context of these enormous sums, the $14 million annual cost of late-night T service is a drop in the bucket. Cutting the program will do nothing to change the fact that the MBTA needs a much larger budget overhaul.
If the cost of funding trains and buses to run at night is truly too onerous, then the MBTA should consider other ways of economizing. MBTA Chief Administrator Brian Shortsleeve has said he is open to the idea of contracting out late-night transportation to private companies like Bridj, Uber and Lyft.
There will be legal hurdles to overcome. Uber and Lyft have been sued by passengers who claim they have been discriminated against on the basis of their disabilities by the two ridesharing rivals. Uber in particular has argued that it is a technology company and not a transportation company, exempting it from the Americans With Disabilities Act's requirements. Any private contractors used in lieu of the T's late-night service should not attempt to dodge regulations designed to accommodate those with disabilities. But these challenges can and should be resolved in ways that make late-night transportation available to everyone in the Boston area. And an effective public-private partnership would do even more to further Boston’s reputation as a dynamic, innovative, and desirable place to live and work.
The MBTA’s budget is broken, and it’s time to make the hard choices to fix it. But cutting late-night T service is not the solution to the problem; it is merely a shortsighted fix.

Members of the Faculty Council on Wednesday heard proposals on new General Education legislation and a joint jazz program between Harvard and the Berklee College of Music, topics that will be presented at the faculty’s first meeting of the semester next week.
The council, which is the highest elected body in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, also discussed concussions among athletes and support for faculty research, according to  Alison F. Johnson, a member of the council. Specifically, the council discussed research funding, according to the Harvard Gazette.
The proposal to create a joint Harvard-Berklee jazz program—which first came before the group at a meeting held last month—would parallel an existing collaboration between Harvard and the New England Conservatory, according to senior lecturer on Mathematics Paul Bamberg,  a Faculty Council member. Members of FAS are scheduled to review the proposal next week.
The Harvard-NEC program currently allows students to receive both a Bachelor of Arts at the College and a Master of Music at NEC over the course of five years. The Harvard-Berklee program would enable students to pursue jazz music at both schools.
“There was a general feeling that this was a good idea,” Bamberg said.
The Council also discussed legislation for a revamped Gen Ed program, which comes in the wake of a review that deemed the current curriculum “failing on a variety of fronts.” A committee was convened in 2014 to conduct a five-year review of the program, and over the course of 18 months they met with students and faculty to hear their opinions about the program.
Bamberg said the proposed legislation “is the obvious implementation” of  a final proposal for the Gen Ed program, which Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris sent via email to all undergraduates earlier this month.
“There’s nothing secret about it, and there’s nothing stunning about it either,” Bamberg said.
The proposed program would require students to take four Gen Ed courses in revised categories—Aesthetics, Culture, Interpretation; Histories, Societies, Individuals; Science and Technology in Society; and Ethics and Civics—and to fulfill a distribution requirement across the FAS divisions and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The final report also proposed a quantitative course requirement for undergraduates, emphasizing that students should know mathematical, statistical, and computational methods.
Bamberg added that the proposed legislation does not indicate the year in which the new requirements will roll out. The proposed legislation also does not outline how students under the current Gen Ed program would transition to the new system, Bamberg said.
Faculty are likely to vote on a new Gen Ed program this spring. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said last month he expects “it would be difficult” to implement the program next fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of internal division over the move to go co-ed and the subsequent closure of its JFK Street clubhouse, the beleaguered Fox Club has reopened its doors and adopted a new set of rules concerning “personal conduct.”
The Fox’s clubhouse, which the graduate leadership closed in mid-November,  is now “open to all members,” according to a recent email to club graduates that was obtained by The Crimson. The Fox has also instituted a new set of “Clubhouse Rules” that regulate personal conduct and guest policies, according to the email, dated January 20.
“Both the graduate and undergraduate boards have adopted an updated set of Clubhouse Rules that can be found on the home page of the website,” the Fox Club’s board of directors wrote.
The development signals a possible move towards reconciliation for a club that has been the target of both external pressures from Harvard administrators over the issue of admitting women, and contentious internal division.
In October, the undergraduate officers of the 118-year-old social club broke from tradition and accepted nine female members. The move came after top administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, publicly criticized final clubs on the grounds of alleged gender exclusivity and the potential for alcohol abuse and sexual assault on the off-campus properties.
In a letter claiming that Harvard had “forced [their] hand,” Fox undergraduate officers, who framed the decision as one of their own, billed the change as a matter of necessity. But in the wake of that move, Fox members faced strident criticism from many graduate members who argued that undergraduates had overstepped their bounds.
A cadre of incensed Fox graduates quickly coalesced into an opposition group, naming themselves the “Friends of the Fox Club.” They called for a special meeting of club graduates, attempted to shut down the initiation of the prospective female members, and lambasted graduate and undergraduate leaders. In the face of ongoing scrutiny, undergraduates officers agreed that new members would receive a “provisional” status, pending the vote of Fox graduates.
Ten days before the special meeting, the Friends of the Fox sent a 12-page missive to Fox alumni berating the undergraduates for presenting the co-ed move as a “fait accompli.”
“Fundamentally, the Fox is run by graduates for the benefit of undergraduates and graduates alike. The undergraduates’ actions wholly miss that critical point,” they wrote.
Two days later, pictures of a controversial party circulated among alumni, and the graduate board shut down the clubhouse the following day. In the wake of internal division, the Fox graduate board president was replaced, and former graduate board member Rex G. Baker ’05 resigned. Criticizing opposition to the club’s admission of women, Baker wrote that he stepped down to avoid further “escalation of graduate aggression and misbehavior.”
The Fox’s reopening coincides with the club’s recent adoption of updated “Clubhouse Rules” that appear to address liability concerns, a persistent sticking point among club graduates who criticized the co-ed move. Although Fox members had drafted a report exploring solutions to a number of “logistical concerns” that might accompany a co-ed membership, graduates in the “Friends of the Fox” launched their own working group to research a “Path Forward.”
The new rules cover “personal conduct” and guest policies, according to the graduate board’s email.
While undergraduate members once again have access to the clubhouse, they are still unable to bring guests, according to the graduate board’s email. Undergraduates may invite family members to the house “with prior approval.”
In a separate email dated Jan. 27, the graduate board also invited members to a black-tie dinner in New York scheduled for early March.

A semester after the end of pre-term planning, Harvard faculty members remain divided on the merits of a course shopping week with no advanced registration of any kind.
Pre-term planning, a tool introduced in 2010 to help faculty members gauge student interest in their courses, was eliminated in the spring of 2015 by a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Students do not currently need to indicate their course preferences before the start of the semester; instead, they spend the first week of term, known as shopping week, freely walking in and out of classes to help inform their enrollment decisions.
For some faculty members, shopping week brings challenging logistical difficulties that stem largely from not knowing how many students will enroll in their classes. According to Kathleen M. Coleman, a Classics professor, such uncertainty makes it difficult both to find classroom space and to determine the number of teaching fellows needed.
“By the time you know [enrollment numbers], it’s awkward if you have to hire more [teaching fellows] or, if you have to, tell people that you can’t use them,” said Astronomy professor Irwin I. Shapiro.
Professors said shopping week can be stressful for graduate students as well, who can remain in suspense about their teaching placements until course enrollments are finalized.
“It’s very hard to match need with availability,” said History professor Charles S. Maier, who described a “great scramble” in some years to place teaching fellows in the right classes. “It leaves teaching fellows in the lurch looking out for teaching jobs.”
Despite these administrative difficulties, faculty members continue to see advantages in the flexibility of shopping week, which gives students a preview of classes before they enroll.
“I would hate to see shopping week go away,” Susan Carey, a Psychology professor, said. “One of the things that makes the experience of being an undergraduate here a good one is that you can choose your classes with a little more knowledge of what they’re going to actually be like.”
In addition, shopping week can give students more freedom to explore classes outside their comfort zones, Coleman said.
“I keep encountering students that wouldn’t have risked taking courses if they had to commit blind, as it were, to those courses,” Coleman said. “I think it’s a risk that people wouldn’t take if they knew that they were going to be locked in in advance.”
That balance between providing students with freedom of choice and mitigating faculty members’ logistical concerns remains hard to achieve. Ultimately, faculty members said, compromise is key.
“Of course we can make this better,” Dustin Tingley, a Government professor, said. “I think it’s crucial that faculty and students and everyone are trying to work cooperatively with each other.”

In the age of Facebook e-vites and mass email lists, many campus clubs still believe in the old-fashioned method of recruitment: asking members to brave early mornings and brisk temperatures to compete for a prominent spot atop campus bulletin boards and kiosks.
Dressed in their thickest winter coats with their breath visible in the morning air, a crowd of students eagerly gather in the Yard every Monday and Thursday morning as they wait for Facilities Maintenance Operations to clear the boards of last week's posters.
“I’m not allowed to take down these posters, which is kind of of annoying because I’m here at the right time and there’s no one here to take them down for me,” said Sammy N. Mehra '17 as he waited for the FMO to clear the previous wave of posters. “I’m also not allowed to poster over people. Which makes getting here early worthwhile.”
According to the Office of Student Life, recognized student organizations may post on Yard bulletin boards and kiosks on a first-come, first-serve basis. Competition is often fierce for prime real estate, with many students already present before FMO arrives around 8:00 a.m.
“I want to get the best spot. I want to put up a whole bunch of them so, you know, it catches the eye,” said Mehra, who was ready in the yard with his posters at 7:00 a.m.
Of course, not all mornings have students lined up to put up their posters. Thursday’s below freezing temperatures may have dissuaded some from leaving the warmth of their rooms.
“My past postering experience has been that there is a lot of competition to get the best spots,” Juliet Kim ’18 said, as she and a fellow Quincy Pottery Studio member Jeff A. Naftaly ’18 member put up posters near Harvard Hall. “I recruited these guys to come with me really early and turns out we didn’t have to.”
Still, an hour after FMO took down last week’s posters, the newly emptied boards were once again plastered with a collage of posters of varying colors and sizes.
“I actually graduated in 2014, but I’m still involved in the Harvard ballroom team, and therefore I get suckered into postering, you know, as one does.”  Zoe C. DeStories ’14 said after taping up a poster. “I’ve been doing it long enough that I know that if you do not get here at 7:50, you will not get poster space.”

Actress Kerry Washington fused humor and activism on Thursday when she was celebrated as the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 2016 Woman of the Year.
Washington, known for her role as political strategist Olivia Pope in ABC’s award-winning drama “Scandal,” participated in her first comedy roast before applauding efforts to promote diversity in the entertainment industry during a press conference.
During the roast, Pudding president Robert T. Fitzpatrick ’16 and vice president David A. Sheynberg ’16 referenced Washington’s endorsement of the #StopHateDumpTrump petition, asking her to literally “dump” presidential candidate Donald Trump by throwing a glass of wine and a pie at a cast member dressed as Trump.
“I’m truly, truly honored to join the esteemed ranks of women who’ve made asses of themselves on this stage,” she said. 
Washington also said the Pudding "were way ahead of your time in terms of gender fluidity and playing gender roles.”
The actress finished her roast by inviting the Pudding cast and members of the audience to repeat a pledge.
“When I give up on acting after five years and go run my father’s hedge fund, I will pay women as much as I pay men. I will not claim to understand the lives of people of color because I once met Kerry Washington,” she said.
“I will be open to the idea that somebody in the room might be smarter than me about something. I will always seek to step into someone else’s shoes. I will always remember to make room in the world for diverse points of view.”
“And finally, I pledge to watch the season premiere of “Scandal” on ABC,” Washington concluded. 
In the press conference following the roast, Washington commented on racial diversity in Hollywood.
Referencing the boycott of the Academy Awards being organized by several prominent black actors and actresses, Washington said that if she were to have been nominated for an award or asked to attend the event, she does not think she would take part in the boycott.
“I’m really excited that the conversation is happening. It’s a conversation that needs to happen, and I think the Oscars really are a symptom of a larger issue, which is that we need more voices at the table,” Washington added.
“We need for our art to reflect all of us,” she said. “And if more people had the same opportunities and access to making great work, then the Oscars would follow suit.”
Prior to the roast in Farkas Hall, Washington paraded down Massachusetts Avenue in a Bentley convertible.
A crowd massed around the car, chanting and taking selfies as Pudding cast members in drag trailed behind.
Darren S. LaPointe ’18, a member of the Pudding tech crew, was decked out in a bright yellow sun costume.
“I’m amped. I’m wicked pumped,” LaPointe said. “You can feel it in the air.”
Some members of the crowd were particularly eager to see Scandal’s protagonist in the flesh.
“If I were to get arrested for one thing, it might be...attacking security,” Sophia Hunt ’19, a “huge fan” of Washington, said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stephen Lassonde, who publicly stepped down from his role as Dean of Student Life effective Feb. 1, will remain on campus as a lecturer this spring, although early signs indicated otherwise.
Last Friday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to undergraduates that Lassonde would step down, and shortly thereafter, Lassonde’s History seminar was removed from the course catalog. In an email last week, Lassonde wrote, “I will miss Harvard and all it affords and I will particularly miss you students.”
But in a sudden turn of events, Lassonde’s course—History 74j: “Children and Childhood in America, 1640-Present”—has been reinstated in the Harvard course catalog. Lassonde said that a dean’s teaching position is typically contingent on his or her primary administrative appointment, but he was granted status as a lecturer for the spring semester in order to teach his course.
Lassonde said he will also remain a resident of Mather House, where he currently resides on the nineteenth floor of the House’s tower, until the end of the spring semester. Mather House co-Master Michael D. Rosengarten wrote in an email that “Mather looks forward to [Lassonde]  being with us for at least several more months.”
Last Saturday, College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Lassonde would be stepping down on Feb. 1 as dean of student life, and “will no longer be an employee of Harvard College.”
On Thursday, she confirmed that Lassonde will “remain a member of the Mather House community during the 2016 spring semester.”
Mather residents this week lamented what appeared to be Lassonde’s imminent departure. Both Rosengarten and co-Master Christie McDonald said Lassonde was a valuable addition to the House.
Lassonde’s seminar, which “explores the literature in the history of children and childhood in America from the 17th century to the present,” according to a description posted on the course catalog, is well-received. All eight respondents in the 2015 course evaluation said the class was “excellent.”
When asked “What would you like to tell future students about this class?” some respondents wrote in their evaluations that the course was “pretty much the ideal history seminar” and a “great class,” with more than one describing Lassonde as an “amazing professor.”
The initial cancellation and subsequent re-listing of the course inconvenienced some students interested in enrolling in the class.
“It definitely did throw a wrench in my course planning,” Gregory A. Briker ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, said after the course was initially cancelled. “Since Lassonde's class was a seminar, I was prioritizing it to some extent and finding other classes that worked around it.”
After seeing the course had been relisted, Briker said he was “most likely taking it.”
The brief email announcing Lassonde’s departure came just three days after Khurana wrote in a letter to Currier House that Lassonde would lead the search for their new House masters and hold February meetings.
Administrators have been silent on the reason behind the departure.
Lassonde has yet to comment on why he is leaving the deanship. Dane wrote that the College declined to comment on the reasoning behind the departure, citing a policy against commenting on personnel matters.
In the meantime, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 will assume leadership of the Office of Student Life on an interim basis this Monday, and will lead the search for new House masters in Currier House.

The five-story addition to Winthrop House, previously dubbed “Winthrop East,” will be named in honor of longtime Harvard donor Robert M. Beren ’47, who gave an undisclosed sum toward the College’s House renewal project.
Plans for the new hall, which will eliminate the need for overflow housing for Winthrop residents, were released last February. At the time, the project featured a contemporary building design that departed from Winthrop’s neo-Georgian style, but updated plans released in November returned to the colonial, brick facade that characterizes many of Harvard’s buildings. Those revised plans also included a significantly larger fitness room, a multi-purpose arts and design room, and a two-story grille and student center.
“Bob Beren’s gift is extraordinarily special to us because Winthrop’s newest building is named after a Winthropian,” Winthrop House Masters Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson wrote in an email. “His generosity is a tangible expression of his love for Winthrop and his warm memories as an undergraduate here.”
Sullivan and Robinson wrote that the building’s plans are “substantially the same” compared to those released in November.
Beren Hall will be the fourth in a series of ongoing House renewal projects, following the renovations of Quincy House’s Stone Hall, Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall, and, most recently, Dunster House. Undergraduate House renewal is a priority of the $2.5 billion Faculty of Arts and Sciences campaign but, with less than half of the $400 million target raised as of September, it has struggled comparatively to gather as much fundraising momentum as other campaign goals.
Harvard spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on the size of Beren’s gift.
Construction on the new hall is scheduled to start this summer. The next house renewal project will be a renovation of Lowell House starting in summer 2017.
“All of Winthrop will be able to come home,” Sullivan and Robinson wrote. “We will no longer house students in DeWolfe once Beren Hall is online.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kara Donohoe, a massage therapist for Harvard University Health Services’ Center for Wellness, filed a class action lawsuit against Harvard on Monday, alleging that the University has misclassified her and other employees as independent contractors, thereby denying them benefits.
The lawsuit aims to recover damages for wages and benefits—among them paid vacation, paid holidays, sick days, and the ability to take Harvard classes at a discounted price—for the purportedly misclassified workers, which include Donohoe and “all other similarly situated,” according to the lawsuit.
“I would hope that Harvard would give us benefits, and I would hope that everyone else who is being misclassified at Harvard would come forward,” said Donohoe, a Harvard employee for more than 11 years. “It’s sad to me that these people are working just as hard as everyone else and not getting benefits.”
Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, the attorney for the case and a former Crimson editor, claims that the workers’ services are performed “in the employer’s usual course of business,” which would qualify the workers as employees under Massachusetts state law.
The Massachusetts law is three-pronged: a worker is considered a contractor if he or she is not under direction of superiors, is not part of the “usual course of business” of the employer, or has an independent business separate from their work from the employer in question.
“The burden is on defendants to prove all three prongs of the law in order to prove that someone is an independent contractor,” Liss-Riordan said. “Harvard would have to prove all three things.”
For determining whether a worker is an employee or contractor, “Massachusetts happens to have one of the strongest tests in the country,” Liss-Riordan said. She added that the Massachusetts test is more protective of employees than the federal equivalent.
The lawsuit could be costly to the University depending on how many plaintiffs come forward in the lawsuit. If Harvard violates Massachusetts wage law, it must pay workers three times the amount of wages that were denied to them, plus reimbursements.
Liss-Riordan, who has sued the University in the past and is currently involved in a lawsuit against Uber, believes that there are “likely many other employees around Harvard who have been misclassified as contractors,” although she did not know exactly how many.
Employee status would also allow the plaintiffs to join a union, something Donohoe said she would “love to” do but is currently not allowed as a contractor.
Donohoe began researching the distinction between employees and contractors this winter break, when she and her coworkers had to take two weeks of mandatory unpaid vacation.
“I love what I do. I love my coworkers and we have a community that really utilizes us,” Donohoe said. “I just wish therapists could really get acknowledged for our hard work.”
Lindsey Baker, spokesperson for Harvard University Health Services, wrote in an email that the University “cannot comment on personnel matters or pending litigation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 29, 2016, at 11:10 a.m.
The founding director of the Broad Institute has come under fire for publishing an article that critics charge fails to disclose a conflict of interest and understates the contributions of women in developing a biotechnology.
The article in question—published in the science magazine Cell and written by famous geneticist Eric Lander—outlines the history of CRISPR, a gene editing technology. Critics allege that Lander did not disclose a conflict of interest in the story: the Broad Institute is currently embroiled in a CRISPR-related patent dispute with the University of California.
Critics also charge that Lander wrote out the role of women, graduate students, and post-doctoral students from CRISPR’s history, and that he downplayed in particular contributions of University of California at Berkeley professor Jennifer A. Doudna, French researcher Emmanuelle M. Charpentier, and Harvard professor George M. Church.
Lander, who was traveling abroad, was not available for comment. Broad spokesperson Lee McGuire said that Cell’s conflict of interest policy applied only to personal, and not institutional conflicts of interest, and that Lander had disclosed the institutional interest to Cell. Lander has previously disclosed the conflict of interest involving the Broad in a July article for the New England Journal of Medicine, according to McGuire.
Cell Press spokesperson Joseph Caputo said his publication is reevaluating its conflict of interest policy and has reached to Doudna and Charpentier to discuss any factual inaccuracies in Lander’s article. He declined to comment on whether any corrections would be posted to the article.
In an email sent to Broad Institute affiliates Thursday, Lander wrote that his piece was part of the magazine’s “Perspectives” section, which includes personal opinions.
“And, when scientific discovery is also the subject of patent disputes (as is the case with UC Berkeley and Broad/MIT), intellectual disagreements can, as here, give rise to vigorous online discussion,” Lander wrote.
Berkeley professor Michael B. Eisen ’89, who published a Monday blog post on Lander titled “The Villain of CRISPR,” said he thinks Lander treats Doudna and Charpentier as side notes in CRISPR’s history, partially on the basis of gender.
Lander’s colleagues at Harvard and the Broad Institute— including Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk and longtime Lander advisee Pardis C. Sabeti— characterize the attacks on Lander as baseless.
“The kind of dedication that I saw firsthand, that Eric Lander had, to supporting and furthering the career of his mentees who were women—that is utterly inconsistent with some idea that he is erasing women’s role in science,” Suk said. Sapeti characterized Lander as an “extraordinary mentor” who pushed many women to have a strong voice at the Broad Institute, and said that the CRISPR narrative was not an issue of gender.
Still, Church, the Harvard professor, said he thinks observers did not magnify concerns about whether Lander was the appropriate person to write a history of CRISPR and whether he and his editors did enough fact-checking for the article.
“I think that you would have to be an amazing diplomat to be so embroiled in an issue on one side and try to write a history,” Church said, referring to the current patent dispute. Additionally, Church said Lander and others in the broader scientific world have not paid enough attention to contributions of postdocs and graduate students to science.
Last week, Lander posted an online comment to his paper, clarifying the pioneering role of early-career scientists, including those in Church’s own lab.
Church said that he thought Lander would survive the ongoing controversy. He added that as co-chair of U.S. President Barack Obama’s council of  advisors on science and technology, Lander is held to a higher standard of academic conduct than others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Needing a spark to keep their season going after two consecutive losses against top-10 opponents, Harvard men’s squash looked to end No. 1 ranked Trinity College’s perfect 13-0 start to the season on Thursday in Hartford, Conn.
In what would be an unfruitful day for the squad at the George A. Kellner Squash Center, the No. 3 Crimson (2-4, 2-1 Ivy) came up short against Bantams (14-0, 2-0 NESCAC). Harvard’s 7-2 loss to Trinity, helped extend the sport’s reigning national champions’ winning streak to 24 matches in a row.
“It’s always tough playing [Trinity] at home because they have really big crowds and they’ve got different paddle courts, but I think we did a pretty good job,” sophomore Madhav Dhingra said.  “They’ve been beating a lot of teams pretty badly and I thought we gave them a run for their money.”
Unexpectedly, the highlight of the day was a battle between family members at position nine as sophomore Mandela Patrick took on his younger brother Nku Patrick, a freshman for the Bantams. The younger Patrick proved to be victorious as he swept the match —11-7, 11-5, 11-8 — to continue his perfect record in match play in his rookie campaign.  As soon as the contest commenced, the two shared an embrace.
At the No. 3 slot, junior co-captain Brian Koh could not get past his poor play in the early portions of individual games in a contested 3-0 loss to Trinity senior Juan Vargas. After clawing back to a 14-12 result in the first even though he let his opponent storm out to a 9-3 lead, Koh seemed poised to turn the corner. But the Singapore native continued to make unforced errors on drops and lobs early in the second and was unable make any real challenge in the third by allowing Vargas to control the T throughout the rest of the match.
Sophomore Bradley Smith also could not get going in his own 3-0 loss against Bantam freshman Michael Craig. In contrast to Craig’s methodical, strategic use of deceptive crosses and tight rails, Smith’s aggressive, yet sluggish style led to him getting behind in points and hitting quite a few tins.
Two other members of the Crimson squad, Dhingra, and junior Devin McLaughlin, were also defeated, 3-0, in their individual matchups. The loss was McLaughlin’s first of the season.
Earlier in the session, Harvard’s first of two triumphs came from junior Dylan Murray, who handled Trinity junior Affeeq Ishmail relatively easily in a 3-0 win.
“Dylan has a really strong basic foundation in terms of his core athletic ability,” Dhingra said. “He played the ball really well to the back today, kept it tight, didn’t give his opponent much, so it’s good to see him get back in form.”
Right after Murray’s match finished, in what seems to be a common feat for the sophomore, Seif Eleinen again proved to be victorious in a five game match at the No. 8 slot to improve to a 5-0 record on the season. After falling behind, 2-1, to Trinity freshman Tor Christoffersen, Eleinen claimed the final two games —11-8, 11-7— to win his second such five gamer this year.
With Harvard already in a 4-1 hole after the early wave of matches, the win was much needed to keep any hope of victory alive. But that hope was not long lived, as Dhingra’s loss shortly after sealed the victory for the Bantams.
In the final two matches of the contest, sophomore David Ryan and freshman Alexi Gosset were unable to claim victory as they both fell, 3-1, at the first and seventh positions, respectively.
Although its 7-2 loss to the Bantams does not put the Crimson in a desirable position, the squad does not see that the result has too much of a bearing on the future.
“Individually, when it comes to nationals when we play them again, I think we can take them down,” Ryan said. “There was a lot of matches that were down to the wire where we might’ve lost on fitness here and there, but I think overall we can take them next time through.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into its first Ivy League back-to-back of the year, the Harvard men’s basketball team (9-9, 1-1 Ivy) finds itself in a familiar place.
Much like a year ago, the Crimson had an uneven showing in nonconference play—dropping winnable contests against Boston College, Holy Cross, and Vermont while playing top-10 Kansas, Oklahoma, and Providence close for 40 minutes. In both years, a sloppy win in the conference opener against Dartmouth was followed by a loss in the rematch, with the Big Green using big runs to pull away in games when the Crimson had the lead with 10 minutes to play.
With contests against Cornell (7-9, 0-2) and Columbia (13-6, 2-0) looming on Friday and Saturday, captain Evan Cummins said the team has to get back to its defensive roots. Cummins, who leads the team in blocks per game, had just one point in the 63-50 loss to the Big Green.
“It’s something we got to lock in on,” Cummins said. “It is first on our identity board and is something we have to pride ourselves on and we have to do a better job going forward to do well if we want to succeed in the Ivy League.”
The team’s defense will be given a tough test on Saturday against the Lions. Led by senior Maodo Lo, the Ivy League’s leading scorer a year ago, Columbia boasts offensive weapons at every position.
Thanks to Lo and the return of senior forward Alex Rosenberg, who gave the Crimson fits when healthy two years ago, Columbia boasts the second-highest scoring offense in the Ivy League. The Lions shoot well from three and get to the line, ranking second behind Harvard in three-point percentages and leading the league in free-throw percentage.
Harvard has a five-game winning streak over Columbia, however, due to its ability to stop the Lions’ supporting casts. In two meetings a year ago, Lo averaged 27.5 points a game on 57 percent shooting, scoring at ease against whichever defender Harvard threw at him. Yet, Harvard won both games because role players like Cory Ostekowski and Kyle Castlin (18.5 combined ppg) were held in check.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said that when it comes to stopping Lo, it will be a team effort. Senior Agunwa Okolie has spent time guarding speedy opposing point guards all year, from Auburn’s Kareem Canty to Providence’s Kris Dunn, and may see heavy time trying to stop Lo at the point of attack.
“There’s nothing [Lo] can’t do on the offensive end,” Amaker said. “He shoots the three, he drives it, he gets to the basket, he’s got good vision, he’s a terrific ball handler … he’s a complete player in particular on the offensive end so we’re going to need a team effort.”
In addition to boasting arguably the league’s best perimeter defender in Okolie, the Crimson’s defensive strengths match up well with Columbia’s offensive firepower. Harvard allows opponents to shoot just 39.2 percent from the field and 27.8 percent from three, both the lowest rates in the Ivy League.
A night earlier, Harvard will have their hands full with very different stylistic opponent. While Columbia has four double-digit scorers, Cornell is very top-heavy, with Robert Hatter and Matt Morgan accounting for nearly half the team’s points and assists. Daryl Smith, a junior guard who shoots 55 percent from deep, gives the team needed spacing offensively.
On the defensive end, Cornell plays a pressure defense that gives opponents fits. Cornell turns opponents over 15.4 times a game by hounding opponents on the perimeter. For Harvard, who leads the league in turnovers, it will be imperative to keep steady and get good shots. When opponents don’t turn the ball over, they shoot 44 percent against the Cornell from the field and 36 percent from deep; both numbers place Cornell in the bottom quarter of the league.
“Cornell might not be as big [as Columbia] but they certainly are quicker and more athletic, and those areas can [and] usually do make up for a lack of size,” Amaker said.
Amaker stressed that one way to attack the defense will be for his team to do a better job on the offensive glass. Dartmouth outrebounded Harvard by 13 in Hanover after being outrebounded in the first meeting, and Amaker said that he didn’t think his team “competed for 40 minutes” in the second meeting.
With the 14-game Tournament starting in earnest, the coach said it is “critical” that the team bring energy in each game the rest of the way.
“I think it is critical,” Amaker said. “Especially if we are not shooting as well, we can get second-chance opportunities so it’s an indicator of effort and energy… Whatever the numbers may be, we need to know we are playing with great energy and effort.

The No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (6-0, 3-0 Ivy League) downed No. 5 Trinity (7-3, 0-0 NESCAC) 7-2 in its first away game of 2016 at the Kellner Squash Center in Hartford, C.T. The defending national champion won in convincing fashion, but dropped two matches to end its total sweep streak.
Coming off of a strong win against St. Lawrence, in which senior Alexandra Sperry made her return in style with a sweep of her opponent, the Crimson looked to round up its non-conference play in the win column.
The Bantams, on the other hand, were not only looking to get a win after Penn handed it its first loss of the new year, but also avenge a CSA championship game loss against Harvard last year.
“Playing away games is always tough but playing away trinity is especially tricky because our matches with Trinity have traditionally always been tough and in such matches home court advantage is a huge factor,” co-captain Saumya Karki said. “Trinity had a huge crowd come out to support them but I think the team did a good job of putting their head down and getting the job done.”
The Crimson had a relatively slow start with a loss in the first match. Sophomore Sue Ann Yong, who, until this match, had been undefeated, was swept by Trinity’s Jenny Haley at the No. 6 position. The match could have gone to four games, with Yong nearly taking the second game, which she ultimately dropped 12-14. Haley won the first and third games 11-7 and 11-6.
Harvard quickly rebounded, with Karki’s sweep of Karolina Holinkova 13-11, 11-7, 11-3 in the ninth spot. With this win, Karki extends her win streak to 5-0 on the season, and her improves her overall record to 39-5.
In the No. 8 position, freshman Sophie Mehta won off of a rare injury default by Alexia Echeverria.
Mehta’s older sister, sophomore Alyssa, earned a hard-fought win over Bantam Julia LeCoq in the third spot. After dropping the first game 9-11, Mehta gained momentum in the second and third games, which she took 11-5 and 11-9. LeCoq was not deterred by the situation facing her, though. She took the fourth game, but ultimately could not best Mehta. With this win comes Mehta’s second victory of the season at the No. 3 position.
“I think in moments like that the girls did extremely well - held their focus and showed a lot of fight and grit to come through,” Karki said. “This win is great for our confidence going into our next matches and Nationals very soon. We are playing well, very fit and mentally strong.”
Trinity took the match at the No. 7 spot, with Sachika Balvani’s win over junior Dileas MacGowan. After winning the first two games by a close margin, it seemed that the Bantams co-captain would add a second sweep of the night. MacGowan, though, dominated the third game, allowing only one point. At this point, it seemed that the momentum had shifted in MacGowan’s favor, but Balvani regained control to win the fourth game and the match.
At the fifth position, senior Michelle Gemmell extended her undefeated streak with a sweep against Salma El Defrawy, and junior Katherine Tutrone came from behind to edge out Anna Kimberley 3-1.
The Crimson freshmen continued to impress on the court, with both Sabrina Sobhy and Kayley Leonard posting wins against CSA first team All-Americans. Leonard played at the No. 2 spot, taking on Ranaam Sharaf in a five game battle. After taking the first game 11-8, Leonard dropped the next two, both 9-11. The freshman eventually regained momentum and took the next two games 11-9 and 11-7.
After her older sister had defeated No. 2 in the country Kanzy El Defrawy in the CSA championship game the previous year, it was Sobhy’s turn. The freshman ended El Defrawy’s undefeated streak in a four-game effort.
Tied one game apiece after the first two games, it was clear that the match was going to go down to the last play. Sobhy, though, was able to pull through and take the next two games 11-7 and 11-2.
With this win, the Crimson is off to a strong start on its three game road trip.
“People fought hard today,” MacGowan said. “Though some of us didn’t play our best at times, we were able to “catch” ourselves when it mattered and get back to basics and pull through even when it’s a messy match. And those are the toughest to win, and arguably the most important to win as well because it demonstrates the mental strength on our team which is so crucial in squash.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 29, 2016, at 11:08 a.m.
After suffering a short midseason slump, the No. 7/7 Harvard men’s hockey team snapped its slide with two convincing wins over Colgate and No. 14/13 Cornell this past weekend, finding twine on 10 occasions while only conceding four goals.
The Crimson (11-4-3, 7-3-3 ECAC) will look to keep its offensive attack in tune in its Friday matchup against Princeton (5-12-2, 3-7-2) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center before its Beanpot Semifinal against No. 5/5 Boston College on Monday.
VESEY POINT STREAK
Senior forward Jimmy Vesey was part of the top class of the ECAC last season, and not much has changed this year. The Charlestown native has an eight-game point streak in which he has accumulated six goals and eight assists, including putting up a hat trick over St. Lawrence in a five minute span. This comes off last season’s performance, where Vesey started off the year with a 21-game point streak that was snapped in a shutout loss at Yale.
Vesey leads the ECAC in points on the season, despite having played fewer games than his elite counterparts. The senior has 30 points in 18 games, while second-place Sam Anas of Quinnipiac has 29 points in seven more contests.
A FAVORABLE HISTORY
The last time Harvard lost against Princeton, the junior class had not yet set foot on campus.
The Crimson has racked up five straight wins over the Tigers, not even conceding a tie in the five-game unbeaten streak. Harvard has outscored its Ivy League foe by a margin of 20-8 over those five tilts.
In the earlier matchup this year in Baker Rink, three goals and sophomore Merrick Madsen’s second career shutout led Harvard to a comfortable win. Not much suggests that there is a strong chance of that changing, with Princeton sitting in the bottom third of the conference standings.
PRINCETON’S OFFENSIVE WOES
Friday will match the ECAC’s best and worst offenses per scoring averages, with Princeton sitting alone in the cellar with a 2.32 goals per game mark. Harvard, on the other hand, boasts the top ranked offense in the conference with an average of 3.83 tallies per contest.
Princeton also lacks a consistent scorer in the offensive end. The top-ranked point-getter for the Tigers is Ryan Kuffner, who is tied for 36th in the conference with 13 points. Four Crimson skaters—including three in the top 10—stand above him in terms of league point totals.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: January 29, 2016
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Crimson was sitting in the bottom third of the ECAC conference standings. In fact, it is Princeton sitting in the bottom third.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last we parted, dear Around the Ivies reader, Harvard was on the edge of becoming the first school to win three straight first-round games as a double-digit seed in the NCAA Tournament. A week after winning a scintillating playoff in Philadelphia, the Crimson played their best game of the year in a dogfight against North Carolina.
A year away has turned the five-time defending champion into the hunted and not the Ivy favorite—a title shared by school rivals Princeton and Yale. For the second straight year, Harvard followed up a shaky Ivy opener against Dartmouth with a dispiriting loss to the Big Green, playing arguably its worst contest of the New Year in the defeat in Hanover. Valuable rotation pieces like captain Evan Cummins and freshmen Tommy McCarthy and Corey Johnson, who all starred at times during an up-and-down nonconference season, combined for just four points in the defeat.
The Crimson come into the league’s first weekend looking at a unique uphill climb. While Harvard lost its second game to Dartmouth a year ago, it had the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year and an experienced senior class that didn’t know the feeling of watching the NCAA tournament from home. While the experience narrative has been overstated this year—of Harvard’s core seven rotation players, just two are underclassmen—the Crimson are certainly greener than they have been since 2012.
Losing Siyani Chambers ’16 before the season to an ACL injury took a bad situation and made it more difficult—while freshman Tommy McCarthy has provided a reasonable Chambers facsimile on the offensive end, he doesn’t have the same polish as the three-year starter. The development of junior Zena Edosomwan has anchored a resurgent offense, but the streaky Crimson remain dependent on avoiding turnovers.
Adding to the challenge is the rise of the rest: with Harvard taking a step back, arguably five other programs took a step forward. Cornell and Penn have played mediocre basketball so far, a substantial improvement over past performance. Columbia gets senior Alex Rosenberg back from offseason injury to pair with star point guard Maodo Lo, headlining arguably Kyle Smith’s best squad in Morningside Heights. Yale sophomore Makai Mason—last seen absorbing a brutal blow to the head in the playoff—leads a resurgent Yale team that played Duke close for a half and surrounds reigning ILPOY Justin Sears with shooting and scoring at every position. Princeton’s cadre of excellent wings makes the wily Tigers a popular Ivy League dark-horse pick.
Amidst all of this upheaval, the first couple weekends of Ivy play will serve to separate the wheat from the chaff. Harvard has two eminently winnable games (at Penn, vs. Cornell) sandwiched around two of its toughest games of the season (vs. Columbia, at Princeton). Just two years ago, the Crimson lit the rest of the league on fire after a sluggish Florida Atlantic loss with a fury Kanye West’s Twitter account would be proud of. If it can channel that same desperation, a team that took Oklahoma and Kansas to the wire has the potential to catch lightning in a bottle and make an unlikely run to the title.
Without further ado, on to the action.
PRINCETON AT BROWN
Casual fans looking to get informed about this matchup have a tough task ahead. The Princeton student paper has published just two articles about the Tigers since school ended, neglecting even to recap the Tigers’ tough loss to No. 7/8 Maryland. The Brown Daily Herald has seen Princeton’s three-bet and pushed its chips to the center of the table, with a blanket no-sports policy going back to December 4th. In the school year that has seen a former national champion paper go Tumblr-only for three weeks, this stunning tour de force in inertia takes the cake.
I must say, Howard, these young chaps must study quite hard.
Pick: Princeton
CORNELL AT HARVARD
Coming into the game on a rare one-game winning streak over Harvard, Cornell should have a chance to take over early behind its aggressive defensive play. The Big Red force turnovers in bunches, a bad matchup for a Crimson team that delivers them en masse.
Yet, it’s essentially a must-win early for the Crimson. Although Yale and Princeton tangle at Payne Whitney the following night, a defeat would put the Crimson two losses back of the league leader with Chairman Maodo coming to town.
Pick: Harvard
PENN AT YALE
What was an interestingly close game a year ago got even saltier a couple of weeks ago, when The Daily Pennsylvanian’s gossip column ran a piece about the rebirth of the masked bandit who leaves his feces strewn around campus. It’s said that all public crimes  draw amateurs as imitators, yet until now the Poopetrator hadn’t drawn a public following. How’s that for dirty laundry.
In true Philadelphia spirit, the Pheces Phanatic hasn’t dealt well with the press. Called out by a fellow student, this fiend made sure that his fellow Quaker opened the door the following morning to a surprise Al Pacino might affectionately call “his little friend”.
I’ll watch my step this weekend.
Pick: Yale
COLUMBIA AT DARTMOUTH
I’d be remiss not to take a moment to honor the Columbia men’s football team. While it may appear presumptuous, and yes—even a tad holier-than-thou—to heap praise on a 2-8 football team, I note that prior to this season, Columbia had not scored a point on Harvard during Barack Obama’s second term.
In the depths of their despair, students the local paper theorized fascist campus administrators had begun using the team to artificially depress campus morale. It’s hard to feel so bad, however, when Columbia parents are notoriously careful to hire nannies to comfort their children through the rigors of college. As they say: there’s no disappointment on the football field a bedtime story can’t fix.
Pick: Dartmouth
PRINCETON AT YALE
When Penn and Princeton ruled the Ivy League, the Killer P’s coming to town almost meant two schedule losses. Playing the league’s second-best team a night after playing its best drained teams and killed seasons; the back-to-back nature of the 14-Game Tournament only exacerbating the pain.
In a newly balanced conference, an interesting paradigm has emerged: each of the league’s four best teams travels with a lesser partner. How this will affect Saturday play, and whether we will see more upsets by lesser teams, is to be determined. However, on nights when the Ivy League can throw out two of its best matchups during prime time, fans can simply rejoice.
Pick: Yale
CORNELL AT DARTMOUTH
The League’s biannual Color War caps an interesting opening stretch for Dartmouth, which has an eminently sweep-able weekend at home against the Gentlemen’s C’s. With freshman Evan Boudreaux putting up All-Ivy numbers, the Big Green had a good look at sweeping Harvard in its first two contests. Dartmouth went 4-3 in the league last year at home, with all three losses by less than 10. Before playing at Jadwin, it gets Penn next weekend—as favorable of a three-game set as you get in the Ivies.
Pick: Dartmouth
PENN AT BROWN
I’ll say this: taking your significant other to this game is a relationship white flag on the order of making Funyuns your one-year anniversary present.
Pick: Penn
COLUMBIA AT HARVARD
Perhaps no team resents Harvard as much as Columbia. While Princeton and Yale have been the biggest challengers to Harvard during its five-year championship run, they’ve done so with varying measures of success. Yale was within a couple possessions of beating Harvard all three times last year and appears to be the only Ivy League team to be fully comfortable in Lavietes arena. Princeton was the last team to win the league and, until recently, could boast a quarter-century winning streak on its Northern rival.
Columbia? The Crimson has repeatedly torn the hearts out of Lions fans. The Lions shocked Harvard three years ago at home and had the Crimson on the ropes again a year later before a phantom call on senior Alex Rosenberg in the second overtime spurred Harvard to an 88-84 double-overtime win that changed the league narrative. The league’s trendiest early-season title pick coming into last year, Columbia lost Rosenberg to injury before the year started. Lo put the team on his back for long stretches of the season, but to no avail. After tearing Harvard up for 22 points in the first meeting—when a buzzer-beater from Chambers thwarted a frantic Lions rally—Lo had an empty 33 in the second as an angry Harvard team ran Columbia off their home floor in a game that wasn’t as close as the final 10-point margin made it seem.
The Lions have a good chance to come into this game 3-0 with Rosenberg and Lo healthy together for the first time. They’ve seen pundits anoint Princeton, Yale, and—at times—Harvard the best team in the Ivies, and they will savor their shot to make a statement on Harvard’s home floor.
Pick: Harvard

Going back to Harvard after more than a month of vacation can be bittersweet, and at times a little awkward. Needless to say, walking into Annenberg the first day back at school was quite the dilemma: are you close enough with that girl from LPSA section to give her a hug? Or should you just wave and smile? Are you tired from telling everyone you know that your break was great because you did nothing but sleep? If this sounds like you, don’t worry; Flyby is here to help you out.
The “It’s so good to be back” talk
Short and sweet, the “it’s so good to be back” conversation is perfect for when you are in the process of getting your lunch or walking through the plaza during rush hour. Chances are no one actually wants to hear about your break anyway; this is just a surefire and socially acceptable way to look polite without really caring about how anyone spent their Jterm.
The “what are you taking?” talk
This is the perfect discussion to have with that one really smart friend who is probably taking five classes. Find out what classes they are in and see if you can talk your way into being their pset group for the semester. Trust us, you’ll be thankful for this strategic move later in the semester. Alternatively, if you are looking for the easiest semester possible and would rather take a gem in which you learn nothing but also exert no effort, this conversation is a great one to have with jocks.
Excessive use of compliments
What’s better than being flooded by compliments in your cardio kick boxing class?
A somewhat flirtatious compliment, whether you mean it or not, is the best way to break the ice with those people that you see all the time but never actually have anything to say to. An “oh my god, you look so tan” or “wait, did you lose weight?” will always be received with open arms.
The “Yes, I stalked you over break” talk: 
Let’s be real: You had a lot of time over break and you spent a lot of it scrolling through Instagram, watching Snapchat stories, and stalking endless pictures on Facebook. Luckily for you, people secretly love when you stalk them, and are more flattered than creeped out when you comment on how much fun it looked like they were having in their pictures from [insert exotic country that they were traveling to]. So this means don’t be afraid to let it slip that you already know about their wild night out in NYC or their expeditions in some far, picturesque, corner of the world. They’ll be happy that you noticed, trust us.
Seeing people you haven’t spoken to in over a month will always be awkward, but use some of these tips to break the ice and hopefully some of that awkwardness will melt right away.

There are many ways to describe Donald Trump...we won’t go into the details, or else we would go on longer than the Harvard Leads email chain. But whatever your preferred adjectives to describe “The Donald,” his decision to dip out of this week’s GOP debate may cause many to liken Trump’s behavior to that of a small child. Albeit, a very rich, very gullible, child with...interesting hair.
Normally when dealing with a child throwing a temper tantrum, a person does one of two things: they either coddle the child (which is never a good thing) or they respond with tough love and don’t give into the baby’s manipulative cries. We aren’t parents, but we’re pretty sure that’s baby basics rule number one.
So when Trump announced last week that he was not going to attend the Republican Debate because he had beef with Fox News, and then threatened to hold a rally at the same time, how did other channels respond? Well, let’s just say that the American media would raise some very spoiled toddlers. Instead of letting Trump metaphorically (or literally) cry it out, they hyped up his rally and even broadcasted a split screen of Trump’s event and an empty debate stage in the hours leading up to the debate.
