After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Samyr Laine '06 made headlines leading up to the games both for his famous freshman roommate, Facebook creator Mark E. Zuckerberg, and for his support of Haitian athletics.
Born and raised in the USA, Laine competed for his parents' home country of Haiti in the Triple Jump. After qualifying for Thursday's final, Laine finished 11th out of 12 finalists, with a final distance of 16.65 meters, 0.74 meters less than his personal best jump of 17.39 which would have put Laine in fourth at time of publication.
Laine's elimination extends Haiti's individual medal-less streak that dates back to 1928. It also leaves just one more Harvard athlete left to compete, with Alex Meyer '10 swimming in the men's 10k open water on Friday.
So far these Olympics, Harvard athletes have claimed two golds (Esther Lofgren '07-'09 and Caryn Davies '04-05 in the women's eight), one silver (Malcolm Howard '06 in the men's eight) and one bronze (Henrik Rummel '09 in the men's coxless four). This medal count would place the Crimson 29th overall in total medals, just behind Croatia and ahead of Switzerland.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 18, 2012, at 2:15 a.m.
After 30 years as a club sport, the women's rugby team achieved varsity status on Thursday, according to an announcement by the Department of Athletics.
The club, which has won two national titles since its inception in 1982, becomes Harvard's NCAA-leading 42nd Division I varsity sport. It is also Harvard's 21st women's varsity team, drawing even with the men's varsity side.
Competition as a varsity sport will not begin until the 2013-14 academic year.
Women's rugby is designated as an emerging sport by the NCAA, which encourages growth on all levels.
Women’s rugby sevens will be played in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, marking the Olympic debut of any type of women’s rugby. Men will also play rugby sevens, the first time they have played any type of rugby in the Olympics since 1924.

CORRECTION: August 18
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Harvard women's rugby team had won two national club titles. In fact, the team has won two USA Rugby Collegiate Championships, which are not solely confined to club teams.

You probably haven’t heard of Denton, Texas. At just over 100,000 people, it usually plays third fiddle to its neighbors Dallas and Fort Worth. Still, Denton is hardly a household name. Yet, despite its relative obscurity, Denton has a music scene that would prolific even for a town five times its size.
The acts run the gamut from jazz combos, to experimental art rock, to  bluegrass trios. Lots of artists associated strongly with Denton have  made it big on a national stage––Norah Jones, Bowling For Soup, Midlake,  Neon Indian.
Paste Magazine named it the best music scene in the world  in 2008. On any given weekend night, the town square buzzes with  concertgoers; from flannel-clad college students heading to Dan’s  Silverleaf to buttoned-up yuppies looking for Banter.
I grew up 20 minutes away from Denton. In high school, I’d drive up there frequently to escape the relative monotony of my bedroom-community hometown. In many respects—architecture, artwork, and especially music—Denton blends the Deep South’s sun-drenched languidness with Austin’s unabashed quirkiness and Texas’ penchant for simplicity. But there’s also something else—something I’ve never been able to put my finger on––that makes Denton more than the sum of its influences. This isn’t Austin, and it’s certainly not Brooklyn, or Chicago or Athens or Seattle.
So this summer I’ve set out to find what that is. What is it about Denton that makes it such a vibrant musical community? And what is it about this community that sets Denton apart from every other city in the country?

I spent a good portion of my interview with Cameron Neal worrying about the ox head.
It was huge, mounted on the wall right above my comparatively fragile skull, and sat slightly lopsided—surely someone had missed a nail somewhere hanging up this gargantuan specimen, and soon those frightening horns would be the last thing I’d ever see.
It certainly did, however, fit the decor in the rest of Andy’s Bar—I couldn’t begrudge it that. Everything was quintessentially Southwestern, almost to the point of caricature, with blanched wood floors and sprawling red cowhide couches.
In retrospect, the place was actually quite nice. It was relaxed, and cozy–– sleepy with late-afternoon sunlight spilling in through a dirty window, and a single ceiling fan that cut lazily through cigarette smoke.
Neal, my interviewee, is the lead singer and guitarist for the band Horse Thief. They got their start playing at places like Andy’s, back when all the members were fifteen and sixteen years old. They gained some local clout, and by the time its four members were old enough to go to college, they were headlining shows and had two full-length LPs under their belt.
Three of the original four members moved to Oklahoma City, but they still play shows in Denton all the time. It’s a story that a lot of bands from the area can tell. They were incubated here in Denton, until their sound was mature enough that they could make it on the national or even international stage. (Horse Thief will be playing at the massive End of the Road festival, in England, at the end of August.)
In every other respect, though, there really isn’t a stereotypical Denton band. I sat down with Neal to get his take on Denton’s music culture. 
“Denton has this special thing about it,” he said. “And they don’t want it to get out, because they don’t want it to get ruined.”
Musing on what it’s like to play in Denton, he said, “It’s a small town, so you know everybody there, and you know all the bands, and you hang out with all the bands, so you’re all feeding off of each other’s inspiration.”
“I feel like in Austin, it’s kinda hard—there’s probably, like, forty different scenes down there,” said Neal. “In Denton, you know everyone,” and he concluded—“I think that’s why so many bands come out of here, more than other places.”
Denton’s size isn’t the only thing it has going for it—if that were the case, every town of 100,000 people would have a music scene this vibrant. I’d chalk that up, partially at least, to the University of North Texas’s presence in the town. It has a world-renowned music school that churns out top-notch instrumentalists—so the talent-to-population ratio of the town is very high.
The result is a bunch of damn good musicians in a small place. And because it’s a manageable size, all of them know each other.
Horse Thief’s sound is instantly familiar. There’s Fleet Foxes’ spaciousness and meandering melodies, Grizzly Bear’s psychedelic affectations and intricate guitar work, and Local Natives’ insistent percussion and expansive energy.
Neal’s voice is one of the band’s standout features and there’s an earthy simplicity to both Neal’s voice and the lyrics he writes; a mountain-man affinity for earnestness and natural imagery––“I am the bear / and you are the tiger / and I will use my paws to protect her,” go the opening lines of “I Am the Bear.”
The openers for Horse Thief’s show that night included a solo performer pounding on a sampler while making noises with his throat that I was sure were limited to cats and exotic birds; and a female duo that sounded like the freak-folk band CocoRosie. It was a bit bizarre, sure, but at least it wasn’t boring.
Back in Andy’s, the speakers played a version of Debussy’s Clair de Lune on a wobbly theremin—impressionist music on LSD, strange but still very pretty. Ending the interview, I asked Neal, plainly, why he loves Denton.
“Here we have open doors to do whatever we want,” he said. “There’s no boundaries.”

The dancer’s foot hovers next to a string. The string is unplucked.
The thought occurs to me that physical proximity and tension on stage both imitates and complicates our human anxieties.
The following is the first in a series of diary entries that track the progress of my Artist Development Fellowship, as I work on a series of pieces for theater using puppets, animations and actors. I hope to share with you some of my experiences and sources of inspiration as I put the pieces together, both on the page and through meeting and collaborating with other artists in London.
This week, I have been working on a dialogue titled “My Holy Water” centered upon a couple’s resentment of each other’s religious rituals. As I grappled with making visual the two characters’ push-me-pull-you vocabulary, I was reminded of I a performance by a theater troupe called Curious Directive that I saw at the International Student Drama Festival a few weeks ago. The performance showed three generations of characters, descended in various ways from a cartographer who has travelled to Norway to chart its mountains.
In a bright, bare room, colored strings were wound from a spot in a set wall and used to separate areas of the stage and cause obstructions to the characters; they were crossed in a grid and then manipulated into the contours of a landscape.
The transformation from map to life and script to live performance was visibly, constantly happening––What worked in a story about people separated by time and space, can work in a story about people separated by understanding too.
