After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before my mother’s wedding starts,
she’s on cathedral steps,
cigarette between her teeth as guests arrive
smiling and nodding as she holds the door open.
Her mother is frantic hands,
reaching under handshakes and hello-kisses to
smooth dress wrinkles because white
doesn’t give you anything to hide behind.
All hot breath as she hmphs:
don’t let him out of your sight;
even a good man fucks
when you’re not looking.
And in my mother’s eyes:
a woman
who never learned to hug
without checking over the shoulder.
And in her mother’s eyes:
a futuro already pisado,
a prophecy of her daughter, too
washing collars with red lipstick residue:
an obligation she’ll inherit like a house chore.
There’s no response.
Only a cigarette drag
as my mother leans
against the cathedral wall.
—Penelope M. Alegria '24's column, "Hers," is a series of poems that retell familial stories through a matriarchal lens, exploring the role of women through space and time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the #MeToo movement began to sweep the world, the ballet industry, just like many other professional spheres, was rocked with overdue discoveries of abuse. Alexandra Waterbury’s case against Chase Finlay continues (though charges against other defendants have been dropped), and Troy Powell of Alvin Ailey was fired this summer following allegations of sexual harassment. Toxic work cultures that allow higher-ups to abuse their power are no longer unfamiliar stories. The kinds of allegations that have come up in the ballet community, however, seem to unveil an underlying, industry-specific issue regarding power dynamics. In other words, those at the top hold seemingly unchecked influence, while the masses of dancers are mostly powerless, at the mercy of directors.
Part of this is likely due to the fact that the industry is so saturated with dancers all vying for the very small pool of contracts available in any given year. There simply aren’t enough jobs to go around — and not enough money to support more artists, when contracted professionals are already underpaid. As a result, dancers are sometimes seen as disposable and are subject to mistreatment, leading many to feel as though they aren’t respected or valued as artists in their companies. Directors might not be straightforward in communications regarding things like contracts, or they might overwork their dancers, and yet dancers are expected to be grateful that they’re dancing at all.
It’s both impressive and alarming that dancers are able, and almost willing, to endure such mistreatment. It speaks to their level of love and commitment to this art form, but it is also indicative of the twistedness of a system that encourages such harmful mentalities. Students are, early in their training, acquainted with harsh teachers who might overstretch them, hit them, and most likely of all, verbally abuse them with comments about their inadequacy, facility, and more. I can’t say how many times in my ballet career students would leave class in tears after a particularly rough day, and this is a familiar scene at dance studios. Yes, some parts of “Dance Moms” were actually kind of accurate.
As students interact with this kind of language from a young, formative age, mistreatment becomes normalized. Abuse of the magnitude described at the outset of this article — such as sexual harassment — are universally condemned. Yet verbal abuse such as those described in accusations levelled against Paris Opera Ballet’s management may meet with a more lukewarm response, even in personal conversations I had with other students when this situation hit the news. One of my friends, when asked about her thoughts on the matter, simply shrugged and said, “That’s just the way ballet is.” I myself can find it difficult to define where acceptable tough love and harsh coaching veers into abuse and mistreatment.
Nonetheless, it is undeniable that the way power is distributed in the ballet industry creates a culture that permits mistreatment at damaging levels. Dance has been found to be the most physically demanding occupation in the country, but the mental and emotional demands of this art arguably far outstrip the physical. Some of it may be inherent to the nature of ballet — it is, after all, an art form, which is necessarily emotionally demanding. But much of it may be due to a flawed system that doesn’t value those who make it what it is: the dancers.
These dual forces of teachers and studios ingraining the idea in young students that abuse of dancers is acceptable, and the pressure on dancers to do whatever it takes to get a job and realize their dreams, create an incredibly imbalanced system. Ballet must, like the rest of the world, grapple with these issues and work to make this occupation a better, safer place for all.
—Sara Komatsu ‘23’s column “Backstage at the Ballet” explores anything and everything ballet-related, from its moments of joy and despair to the broader, systematic issues within it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The existential anxiety of the past months have challenged our personal and collective sense of sight. Forests burning, communities suffering, the mundane distorting into the incomprehensible all raise the questions: What does it mean to truly see one another? How can we leverage our radically different experiences to promote understanding rather than estrangement? Perhaps most importantly, what does it mean to see — to truly understand — not only others but ourselves?
In her poetry book “Eye Level,” American poet Jenny Xie uses sparse, lucid verse to interrogate the intricacies of seeing. Though the poems that make up her collection are wide-ranging in content and form, they are threaded by a shared conviction to question the gifts, limitations, and fallacies of sight.
The affective complexities of being an outsider is arguably the most prominent motif in Xie’s text. In particular, Xie uses cities to illustrate the disorientation, grief, confusion, and occasional privilege that accompanies the failure to belong.
The kinetic chaos of the city becomes a site of introspection in Xie’s text, throwing the speaker’s solitude into sharp relief. Through examining her dynamic surroundings, Xie underscores that her speaker’s anonymity — her otherness — in these cities expands and challenges her ways of seeing and understanding. In the poem “Phnom Penh Diptych: Wet Season,” Xie uses visual observation as a tool for her speaker to coexist with strangers. In one line, she writes, “After clocking out, a group of telecom managers tear into durians.” Later, she remarks, “Someone sweeps thick cockroaches from the floor, someone orders oysters on ice.”
The individuals in Xie’s poem remain nameless. However, through recalling the details of their gestures, Xie humanizes them, imbuing them with purpose and vitality. Genuine understanding, she seems to contend, begins with truly seeing and appreciating one another, as opposed to assigning names. Her insistence on sight as a tool for empathy resonates deeply in today’s tense socio-political climate. So often, the “other” is reduced to a string of labels. While naming often promotes reduction, sight encourages holistic understanding.
Despite her emphasis on the power of sight, Xie also concedes its limitations. In her poem “Zuihitsu,” the name of an ancient Japanese poetic form, she confesses, “I am protective of what eyes cannot pry open. The unannounced. The infinite places within language to hide.” Though her previous poems emphasize sight as a way of understanding places and people, “Zuihitsu” underscores that there will always be certain qualities that evade sight.
Xie’s dual emphasis on the possibilities and limitations of sight ring uncannily true in the era of COVID-19. To focus one’s powers of sight on a person, issue, or community can be a deeply empowering experience. It is the collective training of our sight on challenging problems that have led to dialogue on issues spanning race, police brutality, and xenophobia in the past months. At the same time, relying solely on sight is inherently reductive. Many of the defining elements of an individual’s identity are invisible. A genuine understanding of others emerges not simply from seeing but also from grasping the distinct complexities of their stories.
For all its revelations, Xie’s poetry is frequently — and perhaps necessarily — obscure. The dense complexity of her work likely prompts an age-old retort from many readers: “I don’t get it.”
The simple response is that no one does. To “get it” is an impulse — a frame of inquiry — more suited for math problems than literary texts. The attempt to extract a singular and foolproof meaning from a poem is an entirely misdirected intention. Based on one’s attitude, “I don’t get it” serves either as a dead end or as an invitation to enter.
Given the book’s fixation on the deceptive subjectivities of sight, Xie’s title reads as a contradiction. It is precisely this tension, however, that Xie likely aims to explore in her text. Through interspersing her meditations on solitude, displacement, and anxiety with glimpses of peace and emotional reckoning, she extends the potential for — rather than the reality of — genuine understanding. Xie’s title, then, serves more as a dare than a description. It is a call for us — as readers, as thinkers, as members of the world’s dizzying cast of actors — to strive toward the ideal of seeing, quite literally, at eye level.
—Isabella B. Cho ’24’s column “Ulterior Visions” explores how the histories and affective complexities embodied in East Asian literature and cinema interact with personal and global notions of time, crisis, and “otherness.”

Which Trump administration officials will end up in prison, and which will end up in cushy positions at Harvard? Twitter is curious, and so am I.
The answer to the first question should be left up to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Attorney General. But the second question should be a non-starter: Exactly zero former Trump administration political appointees should end up at the institution whose motto is the Latin word for “truth.”
Exactly zero of the people who accepted positions in the Trump administration and spent the last four years gaslighting the public, undermining our standing in the world, and flirting with authoritarianism — or who associated themselves with those people — should be elevated to positions at Harvard.
That means no Institute of Politics fellowships and no visiting professorships. But it should also mean no speeches and no awards. And absolutely no exceptions.
A widely circulating open letter is seeking “accountability guidelines” in hiring decisions for former Trump administration officials, rather than an outright ban. But while this petition has been wildly mischaracterized and unfairly criticized, it does not go far enough.
Members of the outgoing Presidential administration are traditionally offered positions on campus in a bipartisan effort to connect Harvard students with political leaders. But this is no normal administration, and thus any deference to traditional Harvard protocol ignores the extent to which this administration has undermined the rule of law and threatened our very democracy. It ignores the extent to which this administration threatened students on campus — undocumented students, international students, BGLTQ students, students of color, and more.
This is the administration that locks children in cages, refuses to condemn dictators, and undermines our allies. This is the administration that threatens the freedom of the press on a daily basis, fuels white supremacists, and barred transgender people from serving in the military. This is the administration that lied about the threat of COVID-19, leading to over 250,000 deaths in the U.S. alone, and continues to do nothing to stop its spread. This is the administration that sabotaged the Post Office in an attempt to rig the election and refuses to acknowledge Biden’s clear victory, undermining democracy and creating a delay that will threaten national security and the COVID vaccine distribution plan. This is not a typical Republican administration, and any arguments about the importance of free speech fail to acknowledge Trump’s uniquely anti-democratic actions.
These actions show that Trump administration political appointees don’t care about us; they care about themselves. They don’t care about the Constitution; they care about pleasing one man.
What use would “accountability guidelines” be in this situation? There is no nuance to complicity with authoritarianism. There are people who put children in cages, and people who aligned themselves with those who did. There are people who ignored COVID because it was “only” affecting “blue” states, and people who aligned themselves with those who did. It is impossible to draw a line between those who perpetrate such acts of inhumanity and those who stand by and allow it to happen. Complicity toward evil is no better than evil itself.
No display of morality can negate the role every Trump administration official had in the administration. Take Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security: One might argue that his quiet opposition as the author of an anonymous 2018 New York Times op-ed — and his integrity coming forward before the election to endorse Biden and speak about his harrowing experience in the Trump administration — merits consideration from Harvard. But this is the same Taylor who aided and abetted — and then defended — the administration’s spin on its family separation policies. A person’s willingness to speak out at the 11th hour does not negate their initial willingness to join the administration and their subsequent complicity with the administration’s broader ambitions.
Harvard brings in outside experts to provide students with countless opportunities to learn from people who have been in the room and whose experiences will help shape our own understandings of the world. There is nothing we can learn from people who have put themselves, and their allegiance to a wannabe dictator, above this country. There is nothing we can learn from people who cannot see Trump — and, for that matter, who could not see Trump at the beginning of his term — as the threat to democracy that he is. There is nothing we can learn from people who willingly associated themselves with Trump even if they claim to have worked against him from the inside. By lending credibility to any of these officials, we by extension lend credibility to all of them and their collective actions.
Over the past four years, the challenge was to avoid normalizing the actions of the Trump administration, to protest at every authoritarian turn; now, we cannot forget what they have done to our country. Providing Trump administration officials with opportunities at Harvard would perpetuate a dangerous revisionist history that would only legitimize what should have stayed a reality TV presidency and normalize similar authoritarian behavior in the future.
The Trump administration has wreaked enough havoc on this country, and now is the time not for intellectual engagement, but for accountability. Now is the time not for guidelines about potential hires, but for a complete rejection of everything Trump stands for.
So — no IOP fellowships, no speeches, no visiting professorships, no awards. And absolutely no exceptions. Absolutely nothing for any of the grifting, gaslighting snake-oil salesmen or their complicit enablers, who were willing to put an end to the American conception of democracy if it pleased the whims of their Narcissist-in-Chief.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is finally Thanksgiving — a time to celebrate and express gratitude for our most familiar faces. And yet, as per usual, I’m thinking about strangers.
I got coffee this past weekend with two of my closest friends from high school. We all stayed home this fall, but hadn’t seen one another much — school accelerated, as did the pandemic. Aside from our masks and the distance between our chairs, I felt as though I was catching a glimpse of some non-pandemic alternative universe, where we were just old friends home from college, catching up.
It could have been a comforting thought, but it only made me wistful and nostalgic. In high school, we would lie on the floor in someone’s basement most weekends and talk for hours. My memories from those Sunday afternoons are largely tactile — my fingers entwined in the shag of a carpet, the warmth of a head in my lap, sesame seed crackers and pear caught in my teeth.
Sitting outside a Starbucks on a cold weekend created an ugly, jarring sterility. We fluttered through neutral topics of conversation: “It’s cold out!” “Watch anything good lately?” “‘How’s your family?” My fingers were too numb to feel anything.
I am grateful for much this Thanksgiving, but I am mourning a loss of that sense of homecoming. I’ve lived the last eight months in my childhood bedroom, but I’ve also been forced to distance from the friends that constitute my adolescence. That dissonance — the regression of being at home coupled with the unfamiliarity and surreality of what home has become — has left me unsettled and restless this week. I wander around my house, finding my way with my eyes closed and feeling like a guest who has overstayed her welcome.
When I first started writing this column, aware of how fortunate I was to be safe at home with my family, I wanted to make a sort of photo album of my interactions with strangers during the pandemic. I missed that daily thrum of overheard conversations, jostled shoulders, unplanned eye contact, and all of the other once-ubiquitous reminders that we are surrounded by people we do not know and never will. My most sustained gripe with quarantine became its predictability: an ecosystem without the joys of strangeness.
But I’ve realized that I placed an artificial ceiling on the stranger phenomenon; people and even places we are close to can become strangers again. Or rather, the world and time can conspire to make us feel alienated from them.
That alienation sounds bleak, but I have begun to find it generative.
The idea of finding the familiar strange is a cornerstone of cultural anthropology. In 1956, cultural anthropologist Horace Mitchell Miner wrote “Body Ritual Among The Nacirema” as a parody of the way Western anthropologists approached studying non-Western cultures. He turned the othering eye inwards, describing Americans as a “magic-ridden” people he termed the “Nacirema” — (spoiler:) “American” spelled backwards. He detailed rituals like visiting the “holy-mouth-men” (dentists) and using “charm-boxes” (medicine cabinets) to store “potions” (medicine). It was a facetious way to promote epistemological distancing: the tactic of looking at what is most familiar and intimate, and then asking ourselves what we can learn from making it feel strange.
I wonder if this anthropological lens has interpersonal utility. This Thanksgiving, the pandemic has made life sufficiently weird; instead of striving to make it normal — a dead-end I found outside Starbucks — we might continue the inversive experiment, and treat ourselves and our families as Miner’s Nacirema.
For those of us who have been at home with the same people for months, I see this as a welcome opportunity to interrupt patterns of engagement that feel routine to the point of tedium, and try to find magic and novelty, rather than irritation, in the idiosyncrasies of our loved ones.
I am reminded of a beautiful neologism that describes how we interact with strangers: “Sonder” refers to the sudden, transcendent experience we have when we remember that everyone we see is leading a life as complex, vibrant, and bizarre as our own. Sonder explains our willingness to offer strangers the benefit of the doubt, and give them a mystery and a dimensionality we might not afford to the people we think we know best.
I declared a concentration in Integrative Biology last week, so I find myself thinking about sonder in biological terms. Chimps, our closest extant relatives, could not sit side by side on an airplane for hours, one of my biology professors pointed out in a recent lecture — they would kill one another. But we can, and we do it remarkably well; unlike chimps, we are able to recognize the dignity of every individual as they exit the plane safely, even if we have no idea where they are headed.
We are able to provide strangers with such a degree of respect because we have the humility to recognize that we don’t know what they’re dealing with. Thanksgiving, a holiday notoriously characterized by familial conflict even in better years, is a time we would benefit from extending that tolerance inwards — making strangers of the people we’re quarantining with and even our own selves.
When I interact with a stranger, I appreciate the moment we have together as something precious and precarious. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by how many decisions and conditions, down to an atomic level, had to happen exactly as they did for me and another person to exist in the same space concurrently.
As I stay home, rather than come home, this Thanksgiving, I will do my best to treasure the people I am with in the same way.

Cookies, a new cannabis store set to open in Harvard Square, has sparked resistance among some Cambridge residents.
Despite Massachusetts law forbidding the public consumption of cannabis, some residents in Cambridge worry that the proposed location for the shop will increase cannabis use in Winthrop Park. In a letter to city officials, some residents characterized their fight against Cookies as an effort to protect “young children, individuals with respiratory illnesses, [and] the elderly” from the plume of smoke they presume will engulf the park should Cookies open.
These concerns are rooted in negative assumptions about cannabis users — assumptions initially manufactured by mid-20th century politicians and steeped in racism. After the repeal of Prohibition in the 1930s, bureaucrats looking for another substance to criminalize turned their attention to cannabis and the communities (mostly Mexican and Black) who used the substance. Cannabis was painted as a national scourge, along with those who used it.
By sensationalizing the drug’s effects on its users' moral character, media representations of cannabis constructed a false narrative that smoking went hand in hand with sexual impurity, violent tendencies, and insanity. These associations are probably why some Cantibrigians believe someone who legally purchases cannabis at Cookies will be unable to contain themselves from illegally smoking it outdoors as soon they get their hands on it.
The fact that the Cambridge residents behind the letter apparently see little issue with children’s exposure to the various liquor stores and tobacco smoke shops present in the Square, yet consider cannabis uniquely dangerous, is rooted in this history. Stigmas associated with cannabis and racialized narratives surrounding its consumption inform the opposition to Cookies in Cambridge and the legalization of cannabis nationally.
Laws prosecuting cannabis use since its criminalization have had an outsized impact on nonwhite Americans: despite similar usage rates, Black Americans are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for cannabis offenses. Such disparities have led to the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of disproportionately Black and brown people each year. Those complaining about the introduction of a cannabis store to Harvard Square are probably not those who have had their lives ruined by racist drug laws and enforcement: more likely, they’re wary of those who have.
There are legitimate concerns with Cambridge’s policy to temporarily ban cannabis businesses whose owners are not from historically marginalized groups. As we have written before, though the City Council’s attempt to right historical wrongs is admirable, Cambridge’s attempt to give economic empowerment candidates (women, minorities, and those impacted by the war on drugs) a leg up in establishing dispensaries could have been tailored more directly to aid those victimized by excessively punitive criminal enforcement in the War on Drugs. Damond Hughes, the operator of Cookies in Harvard Square, is a Massachusetts state-certified economic empowerment license-holder. The broad eligibility for such a license means we can’t know how directly a historical wrong is being righted by Cookies’s opening.
The opposition to Cookies is also plainly anti-democratic. The people of Massachusetts voted to legalize cannabis in 2016, and Catabrigians overwhelmingly (71.6 percent!) supported the choice. It is more than reasonable to assume that legalizing cannabis means the introduction of cannabis stores, and if those stores were to exist anywhere it would be in one of the busiest areas of Cambridge.
Attempts to block the opening of cannabis stores now is clearly an attempt to circumvent the will of the people. Those who want to voice their opposition to cannabis markets are four years too late.

More than 1,100 Harvard affiliates have signed a petition calling on the University to extend the same employment protections to contracted staff members that it offers its direct employees.
Since March, the University has provided full pay and benefits to both directly employed and contracted staff whose work stopped due to the pandemic through its “emergency excused absence policy.” But on Nov. 12, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced that the policy would no longer apply to most contracted workers.
“With Harvard's newly announced policy changes on emergency excused absences, more than 850 contracted workers — around 300 custodial staff, 300 security officers, and 250 dining staff — are at risk of being laid off without pay in the midst of surging COVID-19 cases and an economic crisis,” the petition reads. “Many of these workers come from the same communities and families as their directly employed counterparts, bringing a heightened level of division, anxiety, and fear.”
Chris Chu de León — a student at the Harvard Kennedy School and the lead organizer of its staff advocacy coalition — wrote in a statement that the University’s policy changes endanger the “lives and livelihoods” of its contracted staff.
“There is no reason that contracted workers are less deserving of rights and job protections than their directly employed counterparts,” he wrote. “The pandemic and resulting economic hardship do not discriminate, and neither should Harvard.”
He said after the coalition learned of the issue, they worked with the local 32BJ branch of the Service Employees International Union, which represents Harvard's custodial staff, to determine the best method of activism for students to engage in.
They settled on a petition, which garnered over 1,000 signatures in just 24 hours. Chu de León said he has already delivered the petition to Lapp and the deans of each school at Harvard.
In response to the petition, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton referred back to the original announcement from Lapp. In it, she emphasized that Harvard has supported all its idled workers since March, but noted that pandemic-related financial challenges that “limit our ability to do so indefinitely.”
Some contract workers will still be eligible for the emergency excused absence policy.
“In those limited instances in which Schools or Units determine the need to maintain current service levels or increase them due to anticipated spring semester needs, excused emergency absence may be extended as necessary by their employers to sustain regular pay of contract workers,” Lapp wrote.
The petition itself also cited others who have called on Harvard to support its contracted workers, including the Cambridge City Council and some members of Congress.
“As a coalition of more than 1,100 students, staff, faculty, and alumni of Harvard University, we expect and urge our institution to treat contracted workers with the same level of dignity and respect that it affords to the rest of its employees,” Chu de León wrote.

In the middle of Harvard’s 350th anniversary celebrations, Harvard Radio Broadcasting – known by its call name WHRB – had a problem. The station was airing an outdoor concert next to Widener Library when one of its microphones stopped working.
David R. Elliott ’64, who was then announcing the concert live on-air, diagnosed the issue and crawled under the table to fix the problem — all “without missing a beat of the narration” — while the performance continued, Scott W. Horsley ’88, then an engineer at the station and NPR’s current Chief Economics Correspondent, recalled.
It was one of many moments of technical expertise he deployed to support the station that he loved. Elliott, a pillar of WHRB’s community for nearly six decades, died on Nov. 12 in his home in Cambridge after a two-year battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. He was 78.
Elliott grew up in Needham, MA, and attended Phillips Exeter Academy. After graduating from Harvard College, he attended law school at Indiana University, but soon returned to the station he had joined as an undergraduate in 1960. He acted as an advisor for the station for decades, eventually serving as chair of the Board of Trustees from 1996 to 2018.
Elliott, who played piano as a child, was a life-long lover of classical music and opera. He appeared on-air as the voice of many of WHRB’s best-known programs, including numerous extended, themed musical broadcasts, called orgies; annual performances of the Metropolitan Opera; and live broadcasts of Harvard’s commencement ceremonies.
Elliott was well known to generations of Harvard students, faculty, and alumni, and to WHRB listeners throughout New England for his on-air personality.
“It wasn't just his resonant voice, but the way his presence and personality reached through the microphone across the airwaves. His was the epitome of the voice you wanted to welcome into your home! David set very high standards for himself, and made others want to follow,” Stephanie M. Oana ’87, a WHRB alumnus, wrote in an email.
M. Jonathan Lehrich ’88, who succeeded Elliott as chair of WHRB’s Board of Trustees, said that Elliott had held the station to a high standard.
“David long espoused — passed along to him when he joined the station in the early 60s — that the station is a radio station for a broad listener community that happens to be staffed by students. It is not a student station,” Lehrich said. “He has a legacy of history and tradition because he was part of the station for over 50 years. But the tradition is of thinking deeply and of doing stellar work, because that is its own fulfillment, rather than just, you know, playing your favorite music and forcing it on listeners.”
In an interview with The Crimson in February 2019, after his retirement, Elliott said he had “made very good friends for decades” at WHRB.
Lehrich said Elliott had been a mentor and a friend to him long after his undergraduate years, and even served as a groomsman at Lehrich’s wedding.
When alumni returned to WHRB, even decades later, Elliott “always remembered something about them, and what they were like, and he'd remember quirks and eccentricities of who they were when they were 20 years old,” Lehrich recalled. “Just to have that kind of extended friend network is marvelous, and we will be the poorer for it to not have that hub for the extended WHRB community.”
Alex Ross ’90, The New Yorker’s music critic, likewise credited Elliott for his mentorship and for fostering his interest in music criticism.
“Without even really my being aware of it, I think he was guiding me toward exactly what it is I do for a living,” Ross said. “I feel like my entire life would have been completely different if I hadn't gone to WHRB and met him.”
Oana fondly remembered Elliott’s sense of humor.
“David had a wonderful sense of humor and loved to relate all the old pranks (many involving the patch panel in the control room to connect different phone lines together). He had a startling laugh that could come out of nowhere, especially for those who did not know him well since he often seemed very serious,” Oana wrote.
Throughout his life, even after his retirement, Elliott was a loyal listener to WHRB’s programs.
Horsley recalled that one night during winter break, he had been responsible for engineering the broadcast of a Harvard hockey game, then “signing off” the station for the holidays. Horsley then decided to play a recording of Stevie Nicks, the lead singer of the band Fleetwood Mac, singing “Silent Night.”
Horsley said that after the broadcast, Elliott had called him, thanking him for staffing the program — and asking who the singer was on that Christmas song.
“He was of course listening at home, and monitoring it. You know, he may have been the only person who stuck around for the sign off after the hockey game ended. But that was David, he was very loyal to the station,” Horsley said.
“Long after he was able to be on the air himself, he was still listening deeply and giving advice, but more just giving support and appreciation,” Lehrich added.
Aaron L. Fogelson ’19, a former president of WHRB, said that Elliott leaves behind a legacy of “selfless care” for the station.
“He was really the history keeper of the station, and has been a wonderful part of its running and its operation. He really was the connection from the past and the present to the future, and that will be deeply missed,” Fogelson said.
Oana echoed Fogelson’s sentiments.
“One of the things that we at WHRB treasured the most was the fact that we were a bunch of students running a “real” radio station - not just a college station that broadcast just to the campus community, but with an FM transmitter that covered a good chunk of the greater Boston area,” Oana wrote. “While we were firmly in charge of the present and future, David connected us to the past and made us feel a part of something a bit bigger.”
“He had a fairly long life and there are so many things he could have done — he was a brilliant man. But this was the great devotion of his life,” Ross added.
Oana wrote that she had last seen Elliott at WHRB’s 75th anniversary celebration in 2015.
“He seemed exactly the same as he had seemed when I was a student about 30 years earlier. That was the thing about David. You expected that as long as WHRB was there, David would be there too. It seems impossible now to imagine a David-less WHRB,” Oana wrote.
Ellie M. Taylor ’22, a Crimson arts editor and the current president of WHRB, wrote in an email that WHRB honored Elliott upon his retirement with an orgy that will re-air on Dec. 24. The orgy features Elliott’s past broadcasts, many of his favorite recordings, and audio tributes from listeners, students, and alumni.
“It will be as much a celebration of David's legacy as a representation of the community for whom he cared so much,” Taylor wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At least five departments in Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will not admit students for next year as a result of belt-tightening measures due to the coronavirus pandemic and an increased focus on advising and diversity.
American Studies, Anthropology, Film and Visual Studies, Germanic Languages and Literatures, and South Asian Studies each announced on a GSAS website that their admissions are suspended “due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of supporting current students.”
“If you have already applied and paid the application fee, you will receive an email with refund information,” the sites read. “At this time, the next application deadline is expected to be January 2022 for fall 2022 enrollment.”
GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall declined to comment on whether these would be the only five departments pausing admissions. Administrators usually inform departments of their final authorized number of offers and target cohort size for the coming year in December or January. Other departments may see a reduction in admissions, according to the October announcement.
GSAS Dean Emma Dench wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson Monday that the school is making decisions on admissions changes using a “balanced approach.”
“Unlike our peer institutions, some of whom have announced pauses on admissions to whole clusters of graduate student programs for fall 2021, GSAS, SEAS, and FAS leadership resolved to take a more balanced approach to admissions, one that aims to preserve our research and intellectual goals as much as possible, while keeping our focus on the academic success of our current students,” she wrote.
In their Oct. 29 announcement of the change, several top administrators in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and GSAS wrote in a letter that reduced numbers of new students would allow GSAS to “reset” its approach towards admissions to focus on diversity, advising strength, and student career outcomes in those programs.
They also cited the pandemic’s toll on the University’s finances, reduced access to campus resources, and the flagging academic job market as reasons for the decision.
German professor Peter J. Burgard, who serves as Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures, said the decision to pause admissions would be “dramatically damaging” for his department, especially given its already small size.
He said the decision means that not only will the department lose its prospective applicants this year, it could take a long time to rebuild its reputation as a top program.
“Chicago, Cornell, Princeton, Yale, our top competitors, none of them have paused their graduate admissions,” he said. “It’s going to be much harder to recruit students because of the damage done to the reputation of the department with this action.”
“I can’t emphasize enough how fragile a thing reputation is for small departments,” he added.
Burgard said there was “no transparency whatsoever” in the decision and faculty were not consulted in the process. He said the policy was “another brick in the wall of the all-administrative University.”
In terms of impacts on course offerings, Burgard said an immediate effect would be the elimination of some 200-level courses, which graduate students take in their first two years and are also required for undergraduates pursuing Harvard’s new concurrent bachelor’s-master’s degree program.
“We’ll be offering plenty of undergraduate courses for the year, but we won’t be offering enough courses for students doing a concurrent masters,” he said.
In the long term, Burgard said the decision may lead to a shortage of graduate students to teach undergraduate courses, forcing the department to turn to external adjunct faculty.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the College is already thinking about the new admissions policy’s potential impact on instructional support and “the potential need to work across departments to fill available teaching positions in the affected departments.”
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers President Brandon J. Mancilla wrote in an email that while he agrees academics face a job market crisis, it is a “self-imposed crisis in the sense that university administrators around the country have decided to slash budgets that would support new tenure-track hires.”
“Their decision to cut or freeze admissions makes sense in the short-run, but does not solve the job market crisis in academia in the long-run,” Mancilla wrote.
He added the union is concerned the decision could add to graduate students’ “already-overburdened workloads.”
“While fewer students may mean more time with advisors and a reallocation of resources, it also means a less evenly-distributed workload and in the end, an environment that is unwelcoming and unsustainable for the diverse students Harvard claims it will be able to admit in the future,” he wrote.
“This is not an easy situation and every decision contains its own contradictions,” Mancilla added. “We expect to be part of all decision making on these changes that directly impact student workers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 24, 2020, at 8:36 p.m.
For Wesley L. Donhauser ’21, president of the Harvard Republican Club, negative stereotypes attached to Republican students on campus can be “shocking” at times.
“I feel like there's a general feeling on campus that everybody is [left-leaning] and they’re just a little shocked when they find out, ‘Oh my gosh, you're actually a Republican,'” he said.
Despite nearly half of the country voting for President Donald J. Trump, 90 percent of incoming students in the class of 2024 reported they would vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr., compared to just 7.1 percent for Trump, according to a fall 2020 Crimson survey. In 2012, meanwhile, a Crimson straw poll of students found a higher percentage — 17 percent — supported Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Additionally, in The Crimson's freshman survey, only 7.4 percent of the current freshman class identified as somewhat to very conservative, a marked drop even from the 12.4 percent of incoming students for the class of 2023.
Yet the ever-shrinking coalition of conservative students on campus is not backing down. In 2020, the Harvard Republicans endorsed Trump for president, citing his commitment to protecting “American traditions” and preserving the country’s “moral order.” That marked a departure from 2016, when the group gained national attention for rejecting then-candidate Trump, the first time in the Harvard Republicans' 128-year history that it had declined to endorse the party’s nominee.
Despite that shift, multiple members of the club in interviews for this piece quickly grew hesitant to divulge their views on the president, even after speaking at length about their political positions. For many, that hesitance reflects what they believe is a culture on campus among students and faculty to silence and marginalize conservatives.
An ‘Extreme Minority’
Some conservative students say that even before they arrive on campus as freshmen, they steel themselves to be seen as political pariahs at the College.
After growing up in a conservative-leaning small town in southwest Washington, Loren M. Brown ’23 said he knew he would have to “work” with holding certain beliefs on campus.
“When I was coming here initially, I was well aware that I was going to be in the extreme minority, and that I just have to learn to live with that,” he said.
Amy L. Nichols ’23, also from Washington, said she felt she had to combat the belief that right-of-center students like her are indoctrinated before they arrive on campus.
“It's kind of treated as, if you're conservative, then that means you've been tricked into doing something and you're just ignorant and don't understand how the world works,” she said. “It's not treated rather as something that you've deliberated about and come to decide on your own terms.”
Benjamin R. Paris ’21 similarly said he feels there has been a tendency to disregard more conservative viewpoints as illegitimate.
“I don't debate anyone's existence, and I don't think that in an ideal society human rights are something that we debate,” he said. “Clearly, when we disagree about human rights or about the way that somebody’s existence or somebody’s identity affects politics, obviously it's going to be up for debate.”
“The idea is not, anymore, ‘You are wrong,’ but instead, ‘You are not actually worthy of talking,’” he added.
Paris said he specifically resents what he perceives as an unfair stigma against religious beliefs influencing political decision-making.
“It’s that the progressives or the left-of-center in general are allowed to bring their own kind of secular fit into the room,” he added. “But we are being asked to leave our beliefs at the door.”
Especially in the wake of one of the most contentious and rancorous elections in U.S. history, Brown encouraged students who voted for Trump and those who didn’t to seek out “mutual toleration.”
But Donhauser pushed back on the claim that conservative beliefs are always dismissed outright, arguing that there is a sizable portion of the student population “open to discussion,” and willing to hear out conservative views.
Some conservatives on campus see a bright spot to their status on campus and perceived feelings of political marginalization. For instance, Brown said he enjoys the challenge of constantly defending and thinking through his views.
“In an odd kind of way, Harvard can be healthy to conservatives, because it allows us to constantly, day in and day out, challenge what we believe,” he said.
He said he believes students should be able to have discussions with those they disagree with politically.
“If you believe your views are strongly held in you, then you should have no problem exposing yourself to different types of philosophies that shouldn't suddenly taint you in some way,” he said.
Other right-of-center students, though, say they have sometimes felt less inclined to be vocal about their conservative views.
“It's kind of like always trying to hide that part of who I am,” Nichols said. “You need to pick your battles, and a lot of times if you're coming out to say, ‘Actually, I believe this,’ it's not going to go anywhere except people are going to get upset.”
Even though some conservative students feel disconnected politically from their left-leaning peers on campus, HRC has attempted to remain part of the campus political apparatus. For instance, HRC has on multiple occasions partnered with the Harvard College Democrats on “very friendly” debates and other initiatives, according to Donhauser.
‘A Mixed Bag’
Students said they have faced a range of responses from their professors over their political dispositions and what other students perceive as controversial opinions.
Paris said faculty members’ receptions to his political opinions have been a “mixed bag” – while some professors are receptive to debate, he said, others are less inclined. When picking out his classes each semester, he attempts to figure out how welcoming a faculty member is to conservative opinions.
“It isn't that a professor needs to be conservative, but just that they're willing to listen and they're willing to have the spine to enforce an environment of debate,” he said.
Around 1.5 percent of Harvard faculty reported they consider themselves “conservative” or “very conservative,” according to a March survey by The Crimson; 18.9 percent identified as moderate.
Brown agreed that the perceived lack of tolerance from some professors can be difficult to navigate.
“This mutual toleration of viewpoints is a substantial problem at Harvard, especially in a lot of the larger classes where what they're teaching really just can be just conformable to the way they view the world,” he said.
Lucas Chu ’23, who said he has spent his time at Harvard exploring politics from different angles, bemoaned what he perceives as some professors’ blinkered outlook.
“There was like no consideration when they were talking about political things on conservative plans,” he said of one course.
In recent years, multiple administrators have pushed back against what some have termed “cancel culture” in academic settings. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in Sep. 2019 that “hearing each other’s points of view” should form a central part of the University's liberal arts mission.
Overall, Brown believes Harvard could do more to facilitate conservative dialogue in and out of the classroom.
“Harvard likes to tout their ability to have a great amount of diversity on campus, but I think they should start to put a lot of focus on political diversity too, especially in the faculty. I think that's where it begins,” he said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on criticism of the perceived lack of political diversity among students and faculty, or on faculty members’ perceived exclusion of certain beliefs in the classroom.
Trying to ‘Bridge Across People’
Like other students, conservatives on campus feel passionate about a variety of political issues, ranging from climate change to abortion to taxes.
Donhauser said he is very involved in environmental activism, and along with other members from HRC, helped co-found Young Conservatives for Carbon Dividends, which advocates for a market-based approach to reducing carbon emissions.
“I think this is obviously an issue that affects all of us, right, and it's caused by all of us, but unfortunately that it seems that the left has had a monopoly on,” he said.
Nichols — who said she was adopted from China — said she has strong opinions on issues of cultural appropriation and identity politics.
“Cultural identity is something I struggle with – I was raised by white people, but I'm from China, and I don't really know what my ethnicity is,” she said. “I'm very East Asian-presenting, but I also look like I have something else in me, and I just don't know what it is.”
“If we're trying to monitor and restrict people to certain different groups, adhering to their own culture, then we're not going to really be able to have a peaceful coexistence,” she added.
For some conservatives, a few hot-button issues can motivate their political affiliation, even if they disagree with certain elements of the Republican platform or Republican candidates’ rhetoric.
Brown, for instance, said he cares deeply about abortion. But when he discusses the issue with more left-leaning students, he feels that taking a legal — rather than moral — approach can be more effective.
“Talking about the Constitution, it's easier to bridge across to people, as opposed to talking about the more ethical side of abortion and human life, because that one can get very heated,” he said.
‘Best-Case Scenario’
As the crowds on Massachusetts Avenue continued to grow on Saturday Nov. 7 in celebration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr’s election victory, multiple conservative Harvard students said they did not feel discouraged.
Donhauser even referred to the election results as a “best-case scenario” following widespread predictions of a “blue wave,” noting that Republicans were projected to lose the Senate and seats in the House of Representatives.
“Congress – and especially the House, which is the people’s House – shows to be getting more conservative,” he argued.
Paris — who identifies as Hispanic — expressed his satisfaction at Trump’s increased support among minority voters.
“One of the things that has been the absolute most interesting and vindicating parts of what we learned over the last few weeks is that the use of people's racial, ethnic, gender identities as political tools simply does not work,” he said.
Donhauser said he took solace in what he perceives as Biden’s moderate streak and willingness to compromise, adding that he sees Trump’s loss as a repudiation of the candidate, rather than the ideas that HRC and the Republican Party at large have promoted.
“It seems that him losing the election was not a rejection of the Republican party, of the GOP, but rather a rejection of him, the man, and in that I'm totally fine,” Donhauser said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Frequent administration of rapid-turnaround tests could substantially reduce COVID-19 infectiousness and curb the virus’s spread, researchers at Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Colorado at Boulder found in a new study.
While the gold-standard tests, which detect the virus using polymerase chain reaction, accurately identify infected patients, they are not highly effective for population-wide testing due to lengthy return times, according to James A. Hay, a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Public Health and one of the study's authors.
“One of the problems with testing has been that we've been kind of restricting ourselves to these very sensitive PCR tests that are really not designed for mass deployment,” Hay said.
Those administering the tests should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and turnaround time over “test sensitivity” — meaning the proportion of infected individuals who test positive — according to the study, which was published November 20 in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances.
Though the rapid COVID-19 tests have less sensitivity than the gold-standard PCR tests, they bring other benefits: Some return results in 15 minutes, while PCR tests can take several days.
“That loss of sensitivity is offset by the fact that they're very cheap to produce, they're very easy to use, and they're the sort of thing you can give to people to use in their homes,” Hay said.
“The key is that by testing people very frequently, you're much more likely to catch people when they're infectious,” Hay added.
The lower sensitivity of the rapid, at-home tests compared to standard PCR tests means patients must have higher viral loads for the test to detect the virus. But in most cases, patients do not become contagious until after the brief early period of infection, when people tend to have lower viral loads that are undetectable by the at-home tests, according to Hay.
Hay said the tests should be viewed as a transmission-limiting tool aiding public health response, rather than purely as a medical diagnostic like the standard PCR tests. In a School of Public Health press release, epidemiology professor Michael J. Mina, a senior co-author and Hay’s postdoctoral advisor, called the tests “contagiousness tests.”
“These rapid tests are contagiousness tests,” Mina said in the release. “They are extremely effective in detecting COVID-19 when people are contagious.”
Even with frequent testing via rapid COVID-19 tests, social distancing measures will remain critical, Hay said.
“Rapid testing is more a way to say, well, we can detect more positive people and earlier in their infection, and it's for those people who test positive that they must take extra precautions to not infect other people,” Hay said. “Those are the people that we would encourage to self isolate, but it doesn't mean that if you get a negative result that's a free passport to do whatever you want.”
“At the population level, if we are targeting who has to self isolate much more intelligently, then we don't need to resort to the kind of population-wide lockdowns, because we know that the people that are self isolating are those that are positive,” he added.
He also said successful execution of a rapid testing plan still requires investment and action from the government at a federal or state level.
“This sort of analysis should be very good motivation to go up to the federal level or state level and start thinking, well, we need to start producing these tests on mass, so this will be effective if we deployed this sort of strategy at a high frequency,” Hay said. “It's not something that will just instantly change the situation.”
“We need investment in infrastructure, we need investment in messaging, we need investment in encouraging people to follow this sort of advice,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Indigenous students, activists, and politicians discussed the roots of Thanksgiving and systemic issues facing Indigenous communities at a virtual panel at the Institute of Politics on Monday.
The panel — hosted by the Harvard College Events Board, Natives at Harvard College, the Harvard Political Union, and Harvard University Native American Program — began with a land acknowledgement before shifting to a discussion of Thanksgiving.
Keanu V. Gorman ’22, a member of Natives at Harvard College, opened the conversation with a discussion of the true history of the first Thanksgiving in 1621. Rather than a celebratory feast, the gathering of Puritans and Wampanoags was a diplomatic meeting about the Puritans’ ritualistic shooting practices.
“The reason why the Wampanoag showed up to this first Thanksgiving was not because they were invited but because of the shooting practice that was going on,” they said. “They were concerned about the noises that were coming from the encampment, and they decided to come.”
Tara Z. Houska, a tribal attorney and member of the Couchiching First Nation, said she uses Thanksgiving as a “day of action” and education.
She also said some schools still teach a sanitized version of Thanksgiving, featuring “construction paper headdresses,” and said she feels the need to remind people of what actually took place: “a massacre.”
“It's a time that we remind the larger, broader society that the narrative they've been taught is absolutely, unequivocally false,” she said.
Sadada Jackson, a justice educator and consultant, said she spends the day at Plymouth, where she engages in a practice she calls “skillful mourning.”
“This time is a time of holding that history of loss, but also of remembering the ways in which we are resilient,” she said. “It's an offering of a kind of release and letting go of the ongoing trauma and pain that our communities do experience.”
Anna Kate E. Cannon ’21, co-president of Natives at Harvard College, underscored the importance of viewing settler colonialism as a continual issue that is “a structure, not an event.”
“Many of the stories we hear about U.S. history and the things we’re taught in schools about U.S. history are very much tied up in legitimizing settler claims to Native land while ignoring, erasing, and further dispossessing Indigenous peoples of the land that is rightfully ours,” Cannon, a former Crimson magazine editor, said.
Houska said there are numerous examples of “this narrative of dispossession and oppression of Native people” that continue into the present day, like the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and a dearth of healthcare resources, including COVID-19 relief.
“There's so many different examples of what a settler colonial narrative looks like,” she added.
North Dakota State Representative Ruth A. Buffalo added that “years and years of poor policy” has exacerbated Indigenous peoples’ vulnerability to the pandemic.
“We have off-the-chart rates of chronic illness, chronic disease, which make us more susceptible to not surviving COVID-19,” Buffalo said.
The panelists concluded the conversation by reflecting on what it means to be an ally to Indigenous communities.
Pua Case — an advocate for Manaua, a ceremonial rain rock in Hawai’i that risks being obstructed by an 18-story telescope — said it is important for allies to respect “ancestral protocol” and generational knowledge.
“If you're an ally, you step in quietly, you step in softly, you step in respectfully,” Case said. “You watch what's happening, and you learn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With most students now departed from Harvard’s campus, Dean of Students Office administrators said in a Friday interview that, despite some snags, fall semester residential life turned out to be an overall success.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said the most common criticism she heard from students was a lack of communication about future developments, especially regarding the opening of common spaces.
“Students have said it would be nice if you would have told us what was next or what was coming, give us a sense of what the possibilities would be, so we really have taken that to heart,” she said. “It all comes down to communication. We want to be able to communicate clearly with the students and to be as transparent as possible.”
Though O’Dair declined to comment on any specific planning for the spring semester, she said the DSO’s experience this past semester will help inform plans going forward.
“We are in our learning mode and whatever we have learned this semester we will apply to the spring,” she said.
DSO administrators also praised the role faculty deans played in residential life this semester, especially the five new pairs who will soon complete their first semester in the Houses. Alta Mauro — associate dean of students for inclusion and belonging — said the enthusiasm of the new deans invigorated her planning around diversity and inclusion.
“I was really excited to have some time with the new faculty deans and I understand them to be really eager to play an active role in creating and facilitating an inclusive community,” she said. “I was really impressed and excited about the conversations that we had.”
With a number of students staying on campus through the end of the semester, and some through the entirety of winter break, the DSO faces the challenge of supporting them through an isolating Cambridge winter. Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 described the rollout of support for remaining students as an “ongoing process,” but said student feedback will be continually incorporated throughout the break with support from house staff and the First-Year Experience Office.
“We are attentive to the fact that this is a different experience than years past because of maybe the smaller number of students who are going to be here,” she said.
DSO leaders also discussed the report commissioned by O’Dair and Assistant Dean Kate T. Colleran on the “comp” process in College extracurriculars. The comp is a process by which many student organizations choose their members. While some are education and instructive in nature, others function more as auditions or application processes. Professor Richard J. Light and a group of students at the Graduate School of Education first introduced the study to the Committee on Student Life in an October meeting.
According to both O’Dair and Light, the study and subsequent recommendations have been completed, with preliminary findings presented last Wednesday to O’Dair and Colleran. O’Dair said Friday that the study will be carefully considered by both the DSO and student leaders before deciding how to enact recommended changes.
“We will be very overt in how we receive the recommendations and act upon them, partnering together with the Undergraduate Council who also works very closely with all things student organizations,” she said.
The researchers interviewed more than 70 students, collected data from dozens of student organization leaders, and compared comping practices to those at peer institutions across the country, Light said in the Friday interview with The Crimson. Specifically, he said, they solicited feedback from students about how they would modify different comp processes.
“On one hand, people were critical,” he said. “On the other hand, almost everybody said make it into something constructive.”
Light’s team will present the full report and recommendations at a Dec. 4 meeting of the Committee on Student Life. O’Dair declined to comment on how the DSO will take the recommendations under consideration until after the findings are presented.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The newly elected president and vice president of Harvard’s Undergraduate Council laid out how they plan to implement aspects of their campaign platform in an interview Monday.
UC Treasurer Noah A. Harris ’22 and Leverett House representative Jenny Y. Gan ’22 won the election on Nov. 13 after a week-long campaign. Harris is the first Black man to be elected Council president by the College student body.
Harris and Gan campaigned on a three-pronged approach, targeting diversity and inclusion, student life, and health and wellness.
During the campaign, they pledged to meet with key members of the administration — specifically, University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana — at least once a month to address student concerns.
In the Monday interview, Gan said this would be a priority for her and Harris while in office, explaining that while students are free to send emails to administrators’ secretaries, those emails “might just slip through the cracks.”
“Our goal really is to ensure that everyone who wants or has something or has a concern that they want to be brought up to admin has the chance to do so,” Gan said.
Administrators are “actively planning” what the spring semester will look like as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, and are slated to announce plans in early December. Harris said that if he and Gan were asked to discuss spring planning with administration, they would advocate to ensure “the most students possible can get the resources they need.”
He added that their advocacy would center around the feedback the Council received through its fall planning survey, which gave recommendations for the College’s spring plans.
“I have confirmed that the right members of the administration have seen the report,” Harris said.
Harris and Gan both expressed their preference for more flexible academic requirements for the spring, such as an opt-in pass-fail grading system and extensions to the deadlines for changing grading basis to pass-fail and adding or dropping courses. They also stressed that virtual shopping week — the first week of classes in which students “shop” for different courses before choosing to enroll — should be improved.
This spring, the College shifted to an emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system in response to the sudden removal of students from campus and the switch to an online format.
The College kept a letter grade system for the student body this semester but did extend the deadline to switch a class to a pass-fail grading basis.
Harris said he and Gan are “just trying to be sure that we can remove a lot of the stress and a lot of the anxiety around academics.”
With regards to diversity and inclusion, the pair touted the Advocacy Fund, which would be established by the Council to aid activism efforts by College students.
“I don’t see too many obstacles to implementing [the Advocacy Fund] pretty quickly,” Harris said.
Harris and Gan also promised to advocate for a multicultural center, a fight that students have waged with administrators for half a century. In the short term, Harris said, the pair would be advocating for spaces in campus buildings to be used for multicultural events once public health and safety guidelines deem it safe.
With health and wellness, Gan said that while the pandemic has posed new challenges to the Council’s usual approach to health initiatives, she and Harris were “trying to think of creative things.”
Harris and Gan will have their inauguration in December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In advance of Sunday’s deadline for on-campus students to move out of Harvard’s dorms, Sophia M. Fend ’24 said she pulled an all-nighter with her friends to commemorate their last weekend on campus.
“My friends and I tried to just have more fun together this weekend and just spend time with each other,” she said.
While some students — like Fend — spent their final moments on campus making memories with friends, others encountered various challenges as they were forced to pack up their belongings and move out of their dorms by Sunday at 5 p.m. Many left Harvard — which has experienced relatively few COVID-19 cases among undergraduate students — for areas that are currently beset by high numbers of COVID-19 cases.
For Alyssa N. Klee ’22, University rules imposed due to COVID-19 made moving out an even more stressful experience than it normally is.
Though students can usually leave belongings in their dorm rooms during winter break, this semester, students living on campus could not leave anything behind — even if they hope to return to Harvard in the spring. Harvard has yet to announce its plans for the spring semester.
“The biggest challenge was moving everything out even though I will hopefully be back in the spring for research,” Klee wrote in an email. “It was difficult financially, since I had to pay out of pocket, and academically, since I still had to keep up with classes and exams right at the end of midterms.”
Though the Undergraduate Council launched an initiative to make storage more affordable for students, Klee wrote her schedule conflicted with the UC storage plan, so she had to independently hire Olympia — a local storage provider that is more expensive.
And while some students would usually invite their parents to campus to help them move out, COVID-19 has disrupted those plans.
Bryan S. Han ’24 said he did not ask his parents to come to Harvard because he feared they would be exposed to the coronavirus while traveling by plane.
“I’m kind of worried,” he said. “If this was kind of like normal times, my mom would have helped me, or more of my parents would have helped me take stuff back home. So I didn’t tell my parents to come here.”
Before flying home to Georgia, Melody M. Wang ’24 said she was concerned that she could contract COVID-19 while traveling through crowded airport terminals.
“It is near the holiday season, and the infection rates have gone up quite a bit in Massachusetts, so I think I'll have to be extra vigilant at the airport and when traveling,” she said.
After touching down in Atlanta though, Wang described her trip as “relatively safe.” Though the flight was full, she said the middle seats were vacant.
Students who drove home said they felt safer. Jacob P. Winter ’24 said his family drove him home from Cambridge to Swartz Creek, Michigan. Though Winter said the drive is usually 11 hours, it took him, his parents, and his younger sister 19.5 hours to arrive home because the fastest route through Canada was blocked off due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.
Winter and other students said they anticipate further challenges now that they have arrived home safely — including spikes in COVID-19 cases in their home states.
Winter said the governor of Michigan has imposed fresh restrictions, including shuttering schools, in-person dining, bars, and movie theatres.
“It’s a little bit disheartening because when I left to come [to Cambridge], the restrictions were just lifting, and I wasn't able to enjoy the lack of restrictions,” he said. “And now I’m heading back to the same thing.”
Not all students who wanted to return home were allowed to leave campus, however.
Eric Yan ’24 said Harvard required him to quarantine at a hotel off campus after he received a positive COVID-19 test result on Sunday, November 15, despite receiving two negative test results days later.
Yan said he was frustrated by “inconsistent messaging” he received from the University. Those messages forced him to change his travel plans multiple times, he said.
Though Yan said the College sent him an email that he only had to quarantine for 10 days, he said Harvard University Health Services subsequently informed him that he had to quarantine for 14 days.
HUHS Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an emailed statement that HUHS changes its COVID-19 protocols in lockstep with guidance issued by public health officials from the state.
“For many months, students with suspected COVID-19 exposure were advised to remain in quarantine for 14 days,” he wrote. “However, the state updated its guidance last week, just as students prepared to depart campus. HUHS and our contact tracing team quickly pivoted to respond to these latest updates.”
Nguyen also wrote that he empathizes with students who received varying information.
“As we’ve seen throughout this pandemic, guidance can evolve and change rapidly. We understand that some students have been frustrated with isolation and quarantine protocols recently.”

While this year’s Thanksgiving probably looks quite different from the last, Thanksgiving cravings still remain. We’ve got you covered with some tips and tricks for satisfying your tastebuds with some classic Thanksgiving delicacies to (hopefully!) bring us back some sense of normalcy. Whatever you have planned, we’re here to make sure that your COVID-friendly Thanksgiving is fun, safe (yes, that includes if you're doing Friendsgiving!), and especially yummy.
The Strategy
Before we actually provide you with all of the necessary details to make this 2020 Thanksgiving awesomely delectable, let’s establish ground rule #1: divide and conquer. Whomever you find yourself with — remember you are only one person. Assign yourself a specific dish, and then rely on others (or the pre-made food grocery aisle!) to help :) It’s one big group project that actually succeeds.
The Menu
Whether you are buying ingredients from the grocery store or have figured out a contactless way of getting food, plan, plan, plan (do we have to say that again? Yes. PLAN!). Want to be ~extra~? Create a beautifully designed menu for your guests to admire using all of the tools you’ve learned this online semester.
The Turkey
If there’s any tip to take away from this article, it’s this: you do not need to make a whole turkey. With a six-hour roast (no, we’re not talking about Harvard-Yale jokes) and finals looming over our heads, cooking a whole turkey is too much of a hassle. Instead, buy turkey breasts and drumsticks at the store, or if you’re really lazy, a rotisserie chicken will do.
*Note: Flyby does not endorse the use of turkeys as face masks.
Our favorites:
Homemade: Bon Appetit Spiced Roast Turkey (omit the butchering steps)
Store-bought: Amazon Whole Foods Rotisserie Chicken
Stuffing
A not-official Flyby poll had our writers singing the praises of Thanksgiving stuffing, so if you’ve been assigned to this glorious dish, you’re in luck. Luckily, stuffing doesn’t take too much effort — just a bit of thyme — even if you’re making it from scratch.
Our favorites:
Homemade: Epicurious “Simple is Best” Stuffing
Store bought: Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing
Show off: Bon Appetit’s Cornbread Stuffing with Sausage and Corn Nuts
Cranberry Sauce
Is cranberry sauce akin to ketchup? Instead of talking about your online semester this Thanksgiving, instead talk with family and/or friends about cranberry sauce as a condiment (don’t we all just love literal food for thought?).
Our favorites:
Homemade: Allrecipes Cranberry Sauce
Store bought: Ocean Spray Jellied Cranberry Sauce
Sides
The best part about Thanksgiving, and there’s no need to say more. Instead, we’ll leave you with our favorite recipes to give you a *transformative experience* that will make Dean Khurana jealous.
Our favorites:
Classic: Three Cheese Mashed Potatoes
A Little Different: Maple-Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Toasted Hazelnuts
A Lotta Different: Sichuan Peppercorn Marinated Green Beans
Pies / Desserts
In case there’s a bit more space left in your stomach after your Thanksgiving meal, why not top it off with some delicious [insert favorite flavor] pie! We’re not going to get into the debate of which flavor is the best, so here are some options for whatever you choose!
Our favorites:
Pecan: Flour Bakery’s Pecan Pie
Pumpkin: Julia Child’s Fluffy Pumpkin Pie
Apple: King Arthur Flour’s Apple Pie
No matter what happens, just remember to relax, find a little joy in our bleak world, and eat good food — because after all, isn’t that what Thanksgiving is all about?
