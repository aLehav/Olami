After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How much of the Internet would you like to purchase? This question speaks to a bleak alternate reality in which you, as a user of the Internet, are expected to pay your service provider a premium for access to different types of websites. While a basic package might include Wikipedia, The New York Times, and Ebay, a provider might charge extra for visits to CNN or Hulu, for instance. Without net neutrality—the principle that Internet providers should treat all forms of Web traffic equally—such an example could easily become reality. Recently, in a case regarding whether Comcast had the right to limit its user’s bandwidth usage, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the Federal Communications Commission could not stop Comcast from regulating its network as such.
The decision ostensibly and reasonably gives Comcast the ability to efficiently run its network by limiting the bandwidth of users who are consuming large amounts due to their file-sharing habits—but the court’s language could prove far more overreaching. The ruling is vague enough that it may prohibit the FCC from taking future actions as an interloper in the Internet Service Provider-user interaction. Because of this, the FCC has potentially lost the power to stop ISP’s like Comcast from discriminating against its customers by charging different prices for accessing different content.
This opportunity for discrimination is antithetical to both the theory and principles undergirding the Internet, which represents decentralized democracy in the abstract. It operates on principles of freedom and openness, mandating that all content on the Internet must be treated as equal and should be equally accessible to all users.
By issuing a ruling that weakens the FCC’s power to enforce net neutrality, the court has made feasible a scenario in which ISPs like Comcast can charge users different prices for accessing different content. Thus, users who pay for access to the Internet would be subject to the vagaries of the market—Comcast could choose to charge customers more for access to sites that competitors own, like Time Warner’s CNN.com, while charging less for sites in which it holds a stake, like Hulu.com.
It is this startling potential for control over Internet content that makes the FCC ruling so dangerous. Granted, companies like Comcast should certainly have the ability to maintain efficiency on their networks, and because multiple ISPs provide Internet, this ruling may not necessarily lead to higher prices across the board. However, equal access to all electronic content should be considered a right in this new age of connectivity—not a privilege gained by paying additional money for select content.
Similarly, the ability of online content producers to reach an audience should not be contingent upon the interests of ISPs. If a blogger hosts her blog on a domain that is not the property of an ISP like Comcast, she should not fear that traffic to her website will be crippled by discriminatory treatment of information.
The Internet is a repository of democratically generated information that should be accessible to everyone, and determining access to that wealth should not lie within the purview of an ISP. This content must be equally available—not held hostage by a corporation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jul. 11, Nelson Mandela will pass the gold-plated World Cup trophy to the new soccer world champion at Soccer City stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa, as a billion sets of eyes and ears from every corner of the globe are glued to television screens and radios. The international sports media will call it the final day of a tournament that represents South Africa’s modernism and rapid, inspirational distancing from its torrential past of racial and economic inequalities. They will only be half right.
The whole truth would become clearer if the cameras peeled away from the field and focused in on the cramped shacks of the informal settlements on the outskirts of the city. It would be clearer if the broadcasters passed their mikes to the shacks’ inhabitants, thousands of whom were forcefully removed from their dwellings in the city in order to make the area around the stadium look more developed and wealthy. Many people will wait in these euphemistic “transitional relocation camps” for up to 10 years. One of these individuals summed up their resentment for the government, lamenting, “They want to make a good impression for the foreigners coming. We are like insects to them—like flies.”
The government has continually promised the residents of these camps real homes away from the cities, yet there are no homes. In all 10 cities hosting world cup games, these forced evictions to nowhere have affected tens of thousands of people. This brutal policy of cleaning up for the World Cup by removing citizens from their homes with the empty promise of alternative housing is an overt human rights violation that should no longer be ignored by the world.
Unfortunately, the World Cup evictions are a pittance in comparison to the roughly 500,000 people that have been evicted from their homes in the service of national development projects, since the advent of truly representative democracy in 1994. South Africa’s constitution defines housing as a human right, but as much as a quarter of South Africa’s population live in “shack dwellings” where large families live in cramped squalor underneath thin scrap metal with intermittent access to clean water and power. To make matters worse, the Slums Act, passed in 2006, provided legal authority to sentence those who resist eviction by up to five years in prison. Although most of these evictions occur for shack dwellings in which there are significant health and security risks it is specious for the government to not provide alternative housing—while it finances the building of stadiums.
Opponents argue, with some success, that the efforts surrounding the World Cup will have long-term benefits for the poor. The tournament will create an estimated 415,000 jobs, and although there have been complaints, and even strikes, over low wages, it is undeniable that those jobs hold immeasurable value in a nation with unemployment hovering around 25 percent Although South Africa will experience short-term losses from the World Cup, it is not unreasonable to predict that the renovated airports, roads, and hotels will be a catalyst for growth into the future. Furthermore, the nearly $200 million spent on security training and equipment cannot hurt in a nation where approximately 50 murders and nearly 100 reported instances of rape occur every day.
Nevertheless, it’s uncertain how much of the World Cup’s revenue will trickle down to the very poor. South Africa already has large economic inequalities that have only widened in the last decade. There are indications that the World Cup will only serve to deepen those inequalities. For instance, informal traders and street vendors, who are significant sources of wealth for the South African poor, are being restricted from trading in many cities’ commercial areas during the World Cup. All in all, the World Cup will constitute a contribution of less than one percent of South Africa’s GDP, which is far below the desired six to seven percent.
Although the overall benefits of the World Cup may reach the poor eventually, the forced eviction of citizens under the deceit of alternative housing is undeniably barbaric and unacceptable in the modern era. Doing it under the pretense of cleansing the country’s image for an international event makes it a particularly inhumane and insensitive act. The international community’s complicity in the evictions calls into question our empathy and integrity as we enjoy the entertainment, willingly blind to the cost.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sarah Palin came to Boston yesterday with her Party-of-Hell-No Roadshow (my title, not hers). For over a year now she has been a headline-grabbing national distraction. We hate her, and we love her. She’s unpopular and yet a guilty pleasure. But the real shocker lately is this: Of the two members of the 2008 Republican Party ticket, she is the less disturbing sideshow.
That distinction goes to the debacle of the McCain Senate reelection bid. In fending off a primary challenge from former congressman J.D. Hayworth, a man that represents all that is wrong with the right wing of the GOP, John McCain has made those of us that wanted him to be president question our support.
Take this, for example: Last week, he, the self-proclaimed “original maverick,” de-mavericked himself, declaring “I never considered myself a maverick.” Right. As if there is any other word Americans remember from failed McCain campaign.
But that’s just part of a string of shifting positions and exercises in hypocritical word-eating in which McCain has engaged. There is also Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. He has been unabashedly against repealing DADT. He has been hostile to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs for suggesting it. And, of course, only a few years earlier, he explained that any such suggestion from military leaders would be reason to reconsider the policy.
In November, McCain used the “cap-and-tax” talking point to denigrate environmental legislation being crafted in the Senate—a cause he once championed. The authors of the bill in progress were McCain best-bud Lindsey Graham and the man he really wanted for vice-president, Joe Lieberman. They were surely as shocked as any.
Dear John, what happened? We loved you for your supposed pragmatism, your realism. Now you have given in to the kind of political expediency you once decried. But more than that, you hated faux-orthodoxy. That was the foundation of the campaign narrative you offered to the nation less than two years ago. You told us to vote for you because you would never do what you are right now doing. Even Mitt Romney was more artful in his flip-flopping. Suddenly John Kerry’s waffling seems trivial.
Presidential and vice-presidential candidates who lose do have a penchant for self-destruction and reinvention. Al Gore gorged and became global warming’s biggest spokesperson. Joe Lieberman left the Democratic party. After 2004, John Edwards took up adultery. Some candidates talk of finding themselves; John McCain seems to have lost himself.
But the McCain saga is especially sad. It is sad for what it says of our country and of the perils of hyper-polarized partisanship. It is troubling for what it means for the Republican Party and its circular firing-squad primaries. And it is disheartening to see the elder statesman and exalted American hero John S. McCain reduced to a candidate as petty as any. Country first? Not so much.
Does all this make McCain a willing sell-out or an unfortunate victim? To be fair, the trend started, to a lesser degree, during the 2008 campaign as he played to the religious right, the base, and the factions for which he truly cared very little. By the end, the Obama campaign successfully painted him as a hapless old hero lurching from issue to issue hoping desperately to edge out a win using an all-but-the-kitchen sink strategy.
But these latest moves are worse. McCain has now consciously, decisively destroyed the narrative and persona he cultivated for years. Maybe he has little choice if he wants to win re-election, but now we are left with a John McCain that is neither true to the party nor true to himself.
And that is what makes imagining a country governed by a President McCain particularly troubling, almost scary. Is this a vindication of the Obama campaign? Were they right? Maybe so. Though I disagree with the Obama agenda, I—like many other Republican onlookers—cannot say I would feel comfortable with a McCain presidency.
As for the Senate seat, I do not wish defeat on him. The psychobabble of Hayworth is far worse. And I would sincerely hope the GOP will retain this, the seat of Barry Goldwater. Perhaps it is time for the term “maverick” to be put out to pasture, but John McCain deserves to be elected and remembered for the dignity and principle with which he once served. Even Sarah Palin says she agrees with that.

To the editors:
In his Mar. 10 editorial comment, “Work Hard, then Take Shots,” Peter L. Knudson’s direction of ire towards Harvard’s alcohol education policies is misguided at best and pernicious at worst. First of all, his sophomoric assessment that “DAPA can preach until they are blue in the face” runs counter to the organization’s reputation. Although AlcoholEDU is tedious, it serves as an introduction to healthy drinking habits for the many freshman teetotalers entering Harvard. Mr. Knudson argues that harsh penalties would better control binge drinking, but he is looking myopically at the short term. What happens to students who live in a world of draconian punishments for binge drinking after they graduate from college? They may well resort to the bottle when times get tough. DAPA and AlcoholEDU instill safe drinking habits in students, lessons that last well beyond college.
The article’s attack on our alcohol programs was juvenile, but its attack on UHS’s amnesty policy was downright illogical. Mr. Knudson repeatedly invokes the 43 percent rise in UHS admissions since 2005 as overwhelmingly definitive proof of his argument. Yet in the Feb. 17 Crimson article upon which Mr. Knudson based his work, both Ryan Travia of Alcohol and Drug Services and Paul J. Barreira of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling stated that given the statistics, the causes of the increase in hospitalizations are unclear. Does Mr. Knudson have special knowledge that would lead him to a conclusion contradicting two experts whose jobs are to be knowledgeable about this very issue?
I will not claim that binge drinking is a good thing. Yet as Mr. Barreiera said in the Feb. 17 article, some students binge drink because of mental health issues, stress, or other concerns that have nothing to do with regulations. Were the College and UHS to reverse course and end amnesty or education programs in favor of harsher penalties, they would deprive those students most in need of vital services and discourage them from seeking assistance. What Mr. Knudson’s article fails to see is that an increase in the number of students admitted to UHS is infinitely preferable to a single student suffering catastrophic injury or death from fear of punishment from UHS.

To the editors:
One can only hope that the Crimson staff’s Apr. 1 editorial on U.S.-Israel relations (“Stepping Back”) was an elaborate, if poorly executed, April fool’s joke.  Among the sillier contentions made in the article are that Israel’s victories in 1967 and 1973 “demonstrated conclusively” that Israel can defend itself without foreign assistance.  This argument gets it backwards.  Israeli success was at least partially attributable to foreign assistance and thus reveals the necessity, rather than the irrelevance, of aid from its allies in facing the more numerous forces of its belligerent neighbors.  Moreover, the more recent military conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza display Israel’s inability to stem attacks on its civilian population when restrained by its allies and world opinion from taking steps necessary to dismantle the terrorist infrastructures of Hamas and Hezbollah.  The Crimson staff also incorrectly suggests that the U.S. has, over the decades, uncritically given Israel carte blanche to pursue its military objectives.  However, it is in part thanks to U.S. efforts that Israel did not oust the radical nationalist Nasser regime in 1956, or march on Damascus in 1973, or eliminate Yassir Arafat and the PLO in 1982.
Yet perhaps even worse than its distortion of history is the Crimson staff’s use of vague generalizations where specifics are needed for reasoned debate.  Which of the dictatorships and monarchies surrounding Israel does the Crimson staff believe the U.S. must grow closer to?  Which Israeli actions does the Crimson staff consider “atrocities” rather than legitimate self-defense?  Rather than answer such questions and provide concrete policy prescriptions, the Crimson falls back on the trope—popular among totalitarian regimes during the Cold War—that Israeli actions are imperialist and racist.  The Crimson appears to place unilateral blame for the failure of the peace process on Israel, making no mention of the rejectionism or eliminationist ideology of Israel’s enemies.  Nowhere does the Crimson recognize the multiple times Israel has shown itself ready to give up land—whether in Sinai, Lebanon, or Gaza—only to be met with further terror and aggression.
It is disheartening to think that the Crimson’s position reflects the analysis and discourse about complex foreign policy questions occurring on our college campuses.  Sensible policy makers should regard such articles as evidence of the need to better educate young adults rather than as advice on how to run foreign affairs.

I just filled out my census, and boy are my arms tired!
Well, technically I’ve only opened the envelope. But I’m already trembling.
The Census is, after all, the BFD of the USA—that decade-on-decade tradition of writing down your name. So you’ll have to forgive my forearm tremors—it’s my first time “census-ing,” and I want to get it right. I want to make it special.
It’s comforting to know that the Census Bureau is trying as well. They’ve shelled out $340 million to convince folks to participate in the survey, including $2.5 million spent on an incomprehensible Christopher Guest TV spot that played during the Super Bowl.
The Bureau’s print campaign has been similarly aggressive, albeit disappointingly straightforward compared to its televised counterpart. Billboards and bus ads alike now pose questions like “If we don’t know how many people we have, how do we know how many hospitals to build?” Or, “If we can’t count the assholes, how can we build enough Spencer’s Gifts?”
So much effort. So much money. All designed to get this in my hands: Bluish-gray. 8 1/2 by 11. Kind of smells like old people’s pants.
The Bureau is committed to efficiency. The front page promises that my “burden” will only be five minutes; should I find I’ve spent more time, they suggest I snail mail complaints to <<Paperwork Reduction Project 0607-0919-C, U.S. Census Bureau, AMSD-3K138, 4600 Silver Hill Road, Washington, DC 20233>>. I guess they count instances of irony in a different office.
That’s fine; let’s move on. If you haven’t already done your census, roll on down to your mailbox. It’ll be more exciting if we do this together (plus, these jokes might actually make sense). Got it? Bam. Now let’s do some good.
’Cause we are doing good, after all. Or at least what everyone likes to think of as good. The census is the bureaucratic equivalent of stopping for an ambulance. Sure, it helps people, but you don’t actually do it for that reason. You do it to feel smarmy and justifiably self-righteous. That’s why I always pass hospitals when I’m driving other people—I’m an exhibitionist civil responsibilitarian. And I’m guessing you are too, so help me out. We’ve only got four minutes left.
Question 1) Full name.
See byline. The T stands for Theodore, by the way, if you want to get me an inscribed watch celebrating this occasion.
2) What is my sex?
Insert easy joke here.
3) What is your age and birth date?
Actually, guv’ment, by subtractin’ my birth date from the current date, you can figger my age yourself!
4) What flavor of Mexican are the members of your household? Mexican, Mexican American, Puerto Rican or Cuban?
To be safe, I follow my friend Brian’s advice. “Make each of your roommates a little Mexican. It lets them know you’re not a racist who wouldn’t live with Mexicans.”
4a) Are you a racist?
Yes!
5) What is your race?
I’m glad our country’s moved past this whole race thing. But I guess we can’t exactly skirt the Constitution: “And a census shall be took of all Americans, sorting them soundly by the color of their skin. And also note the Mexicans.”  I’ll admit to being white. See attached photo.
6) Do you live in this facility MOST OF THE TIME?
Like inside of it? Like do I not go out? ’Cause I don’t have anything else to do? I’m sorry; I’m confused. Maybe if you’d used more caps lock I’d understand MORE COMPLETELY.
7) What is your exact address MOST OF THE TIME?
Much too paranoid to fill this out.
8) Did you enjoy this Census?
Like a bowl of cake. See ya next decade.

Ladies and gentlemen, I read the newspapers. I know what this new health care thing is really about. Go ahead, read to the bottom: there’s a section at the end that they’ve been trying to hide, from all of us. I call it TTOTS:  The Tax On Tanning Salons. What Obama didn’t tell you is that the next time I take the ferry to Staten Island, hang a left on Father Capadano Boulevard, get a slice at Gino’s, and then get my weekly tan on in Caribbean Delights, Il Duce will be taking his 10 percent.
This is problematic for me. Summer is coming: if I don’t get my brown going, then the clubs might as well be closed. And then my new tight white t-shirt and hair gel would go to waste. I won’t even start about the months and months of Muscle Milk virtually flushed down the toilet.
Recently, after calling my Mom and getting a good lift in at the gym, albeit with minor annoyances (I’m looking at you, sweatpants—don’t go sleeveless until you bench 250, and that’s an exact figure), I realized that there was a stopgap solution: I could tan outside.
It’s great. It’s cheap (still have to have my Banana Boat oil—$8.50 when you buy in bulk). It’s healthy. I even got some reading done, now that my Sports Illustrated came in. The bulbs in Caribbean Delights were too bright, and sometimes they lit the pages on fire.
I saw all these people there too, which was funny, as if they didn’t know they had just opened a Sun-tastic in the Garage. I was like, guys, I’m in college, I can’t afford the high-end stuff, but let’s be real—some of these people looked like they could splurge.
Honestly, I would say I don’t mind the outdoor thing. I might say I love it. But I’ll go back inside soon; I’ve got some coupons to finish off.

If you know me at all, you know that I like to maintain a certain sun-kissed glow all year round. I’ve even been accused of being “tanorexic,” a charge I can’t entirely deny. I love the sun; I love sunbathing. In between classes, walking in the Yard on a hot spring day, you might see me standing alone, eyes closed, facing up towards the sun, relishing the spare 60 seconds I have to get a hearty—albeit brief—dose of Vitamin D.
As a Quadling, the springtime weather beckons me outside to lounge in the grass and soak up the rays. When I do, however, I do so with the understanding that I’m still on the Harvard campus, not on a beach, at a pool, or at USC. Therefore, I don’t wear a bikini: I’ll wear something more conservative, like shorts and a tank top. It’s just plain awkward to be walking through the Yard or coming home to the Quad and see a girl stretched out on a towel, clad in a skimpy bikini.
This isn’t a feminist argument against bikinis (plus, look up the etymology of bikini and you’ll find a surprisingly powerful history). I just think it’s weird and inappropriate to wear a bikini in the Yard, only feet away from Faust’s office, or even in the more secluded Quad, where your House Master and dining hall staff can walk by and see your pasty thighs and jiggling boobs.
Besides the risk of running into a professor or TF in this situation, you’re also exposing yourself to a plethora of Harvard Square freaks: one minute you might be laying out, dozing off listening to John Mayer on your iPod, and the next minute, you look up and a homeless man is hovering over you jerking off. Seriously, it’s the Square—it’s probably happened. We go to school in an urban environment; bikinis just don’t belong here.

On a campus with a hefty ultra-competitive pre-med population, it is easy to forget that some Harvard students will grow up to inspect wisdom teeth rather than clogged arteries and upset stomachs. Pre-dental students, unlike their doctor-hopeful peers, have to deal with a campus that doesn’t always know that they exist.
“When people find out that I’m pre-dental, they are surprised,” said Rafael T. Quintanar ’10. According to him, a support group used to exist—the Harvard College Pre-Dental Society, for which he was secretary. Now pre-dental student Rachel M. Black ’11 is looking revive the organization.
“The number of pre-dental students seems to be on the rise nationwide,” she said. “It makes sense to have a support group at Harvard.” Although many dental school requirements are similar to those for medical school, there are certain nuances for which specialized support would be beneficial.
One of these is the job-shadowing requirement. Black said she hopes to incorporate shadowing opportunities into the organization’s activities, as well as tours of local dental schools, including Harvard’s.
A major obstacle for pre-dental students is a lack of the structured advising in the Houses that exists for medicine, law, and business. The group’s faculty advisor, Assistant Professor in Human Evolutionary Biology Tanya Smith, said she is hoping for similar resources to be introduced for pre-dental students.
“If the student initiative is consistent, we could even push for administrative support,” she said.
Pre-dental student Eric C. Chen ’12 attributed the lack of resources to low interest in the field. Nevertheless, he said he believes that dentistry may be more important than its popularity as a career choice would suggest.
“You go to the doctor for one annual physical, but usually you see the dentist for a checkup twice a year,” said Chen.

According to the Harvard College Fund Web site, “Senior Gift is about coming together as a class and giving back to our college.” With its “$10 for 2010” campaign, the Senior Gift Committee is aiming for every graduating senior to donate at least $10, especially after the Class of 2009 broke previous records with a 74.1 percent participation rate. Students can choose to give to financial aid, the Dean’s Fund for Undergraduate Experience, or a pool of unrestricted funds to be used where money is needed most this year. Past senior gift donations have helped fund new projects, including the Queen’s Head Pub and the Women’s Leadership Conference. But perhaps more important than the immediate benefits to the College is the introduction that Senior Gift provides into the world of alumni giving.
To that end, the Committee, which is led by co-chairs Alterrell M.F. Mills ’10, Diana C. Robles ’10, and Mary K.B. Cox ’10, also oversees a special Associates Committee dedicated to soliciting donations of $250 or more; these gifts are then labeled “Associates-level.” With this special committee, the Senior Gift campaign attempts to succeed as both a symbol of class camaraderie and as a fundraising effort.
“Our big goal is participation while still acknowledging that there are students on campus who can make that Associates-level gift,” Cox says.
DEBUNKING THE ASSOCIATE’S COMMITTEE
Within a Senior Gift Committee of more than 150 people, there are 5 Associates Chairs and 21 Associates Committee members who are charged with the task of asking their peers for relatively large sums of money. The job has two important requirements.
“It’s a sensitive topic,” Mills said. “We look for people who are able to approach it in a sensitive way.” Additionally, the Chairs and Committee members make a commitment to contribute an Associates gift themselves.
“It’s more about your dedication than your actual ability to make that gift,” Mills says. However, he also adds: “It’s easier to have a conversation about making a gift of that proportion when you yourself have given.”
As a group, the Associates Committee goes through the class list and identifies people they think might be willing to make Associates-level donations. Everyone interviewed for this article confirmed that neither the Committee nor the Harvard College Fund had information about the financial status of any individual senior.
“We’ve all agreed not to approach this in terms of [asking] who’s got money,” says Celia R. Maccoby ’07, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Programs at the Harvard College Fund, who is in charge of managing the Senior Gift.  “We’re really thinking about people we know who had a really positive experience here and would want to give at a higher level.”
“One misconception is that we only approach those who we are sure can give,” said Majla Custo ‘10, one of the Associates Chairs.
Custo, Maccoby, and the three Committee co-chairs all asserted that there is not always a correlation between financial status and commitment to donate at the Associates level. Wealthy students may not have an inclination to give, and in recent years, students from more modest means have both made Associates-level gifts and served on the Associates Committee.
Associates-level donors represent a small percentage of the total number of donors. Maccoby estimated that of the roughly 1,100 students who donated last year, approximately 60 gave Associates-level gifts. Moreover, while most of the money raised for most alumni classes comes from Associates’ gifts, Associates’ donations constitute a smaller proportion of the total Senior Gift.
A BROADER EFFORT
Of course, there is the more publicized drive for pure participation, which consists of over 125 volunteers organized into teams by House. Since the end of March, they work to convince each senior in their respective Houses to make a $10 donation and sign the 2010 Pledge, a promise to donate annually for the next five years. Thus far, Quincy is in the lead, with a participation rate of 35.5 percent.
Alexander J. Lavoie ’10, Participation Chair of Quincy House, notes that their efforts cannot be about simple dollar amounts, as most students will not be able to donate a lot at this point of their lives. “Participating in Senior Gift is a display of your thankfulness about what Harvard has done for you,” he says.
The co-chairs were also quick to emphasize the importance of participation-level gifts. “An Associates-level gift doesn’t count any more than a gift of a smaller amount,” Cox says.
Maccoby agrees that all types of gifts are considered to be equal gestures. “We always talk about proportional giving,” she says.
While there is a party for all people who contributed to the Senior Gift, those who give at the Associates level are invited to a reception at the end of the year, where they will hear from the Vice President of Alumni Affairs and Development.
“We want to thank them for joining this group of leadership donors,” Maccoby says.
But regardless of whether they are speaking with a potential donor of $250 or $10, Committee members encourage seniors to reflect on their time at Harvard. On the Senior Gift 2010 Facebook page, recent donors from the Class of 2010 share why they chose to donate; popular responses include their allegiance to their blockmates, House activities, and student organizations.
“It’s all about helping people realize why it means so much to give back to Harvard,” Robles says.
In her role as an Associates Chair, Custo has had dozens of conversations with seniors encouraging them to donate.
“In every conversation that you are reflecting back on your four years,” she says. “But at the same time you’re talking about the future and where the money you’re raising is going. That makes a full circle.”

THE PREGAME
First piece of advice: set your alarm. It is a Sunday after all, and since Harvard apparently doesn’t celebrate Patriot’s Day like the rest of Massachusetts, you’re going to have to wake up for class on Monday. If you actually remember to do this after Yardfest, you’re a huge failure.
Then you need to get some food in your system, but who says you have to be sober while stuffing yourself with all of the breakfast delights you don’t get during the week? Sunday brunch plus impending free concert practically demands mimosas. The day should at least start classy.
After mimosas, it’s crunch time. As the hour draws nigh, it’s time to cram those lyrics while downing drinks. The possibilities are endless, from power hours with minute-long snippets of each artist’s songs to musical chairs, the drinking edition. By the time you’re sufficiently buzzed, it will be time to head to the Yard.
THE CONCERT
The Problem: No cheat sheets­—how do you pretend that you know the lyrics?
The Solution: If it’s Kid Cudi, no worries. For most songs, repeating the last two words of a line will do, and throwing in a “what, what” every once  in a while can even make it seem like you know the song. Wale only has one song, so just learn it. As for Patrick Park, if you listen closely, half of his songs are actually just him softly weeping—don’t even bother.
The Problem: The artists are indie and hip-hop, and you fall far from either of these extremes. Which genre do you feign an interest in?
The Solution: While Kid Cudi sings about freeing his mind “a puff at a time,” Park’s allusions to illegal substances are far and few between (“your smile is a drug”?). Few people are diehard fans of both, so don’t attempt to convince others that you’ve followed the cross-country tours of all three. Pick one, stick with it, make it believable: “Yeah, sometimes I sing ‘O Let’s Do it Freestyle’ in the shower. My blockmates aren’t really into it.”
The problem: Clothing.
The Solution: Don’t run to Urban Outfitters in a desperate attempt to look indie and definitely do not make a day trip to the CambridgeSide Galleria in search of baggy pants and fitteds. This is still Harvard, and HUPD will probably remove you anyway if you’re not wearing Nantucket Reds and Top Siders.
The Problem: You listen to hip-hop while getting wasted on Saturday nights, but you’ve never listened to indie in your life.
The Solution: Just claim to be so indie that you stopped listening to Peter Parker before he “sold out”—you feel that underground music is more genuine. Make up a name of another “artist” that you’re currently into, and people will think that you’re both legit and really pretentious. Perfect.
The Problem: Even this advice can’t make you appear to be a true fan.
The Solution: Don’t worry. You’ll probably spend most of Kid Cudi’s performance texting your friends at state schools about the fact that you’re watching Kid Cudi perform. You don’t really need to sing along or appear interested anyway.
THE POSTGAME
When Kid Cudi leaves the stage, you really just have two options remaining: continue the party or take steps to prevent your hangover. If you’ve got some extra dough to shell out you could start bumpin’ and grindin’ (and flying?) at Rumor with the gentlemen of the PSK. If not, you could always sit back, relax, and listen to Kid Cudi while staring into the iTunes visualizer.
No matter what you do, at the end of the night, you’re going to have to recuperate eventually. First, your ears—if you were one of the lucky ones standing next to the speakers, you might want to give yourself an hour to regain your hearing. If it doesn’t come back, check for bleeding and make an appointment at UHS. Next step? Take preventative measures for your impending hangover. Hit up your favorite Square munchies joint to absorb whatever’s left of the champagne, beer, and other substances in your stomach. Then trek it to CVS and chug at least three Vitamin Waters before passing out for the start of another week.

If you aren’t a fan of hip-hop and are dreading Yardfest this Sunday, don’t write off the event just yet: Olubowale Victor Akintimehin—otherwise known as Wale—is an up-and-coming D.C. rapper and DJ whose innovative work tackles tough issues with a creative bent. Incorporating go-go music, his African background, and unconventional drum beats into his music, Wale has differentiated himself through collaborations with artists ranging from Lady Gaga and Marsha Ambrosius to Talib Kweli and David Sitek of TV on the Radio. FM caught up with Wale to talk about his musical influences, the upcoming performance at Harvard, and freestyling at Denny’s.
1. Fifteen Minutes: How did you break into the music business?
Wale: Uh, the old fashioned way. Really, I was just blind.
2. FM: Can you talk a little bit about how growing up in D.C. has affected you and your music?
Wale: Obviously it isn’t directly or indirectly. I like the drums—the drums I normally pick for my beats kind of have that element. Mid-’90s go-go music is definitely a platform for my music.
3. FM: You played football for Robert Morris University and Virginia State. What caused you to switch your focus from athletics to music, or had you always loved both?
Wale: I think I might have loved football more than music for the majority of my life. It kind of fluctuates now, goes in and out now. Some days I wake up and just wish I were in training camp and some days I wake up glad that I’m about to get on the stage.
4. FM: How do you feel about performing at Harvard? Will it be different from your other performances in any way?
Wale: Every show is different. I always add a little something because it always feels different. I am going to give it all I got like I always do, you know what I’m saying, and Harvard always shows me a lot of love.
5. FM: What genres of music or which artists do you feel that you are most influenced by?
Wale: Hip-hop, Afro-beat, reggae, a little bit, R&B, a lot of soul.
6. FM: It seems that your songs deal with issues like racism that are heavier than many popular rap songs. Why did you choose to take this route with your music?
Wale: I just think that music is the way to speak to people. I just like to talk about what is on my mind. Whatever is on my mind whenever I am writing in the studio is just what I have to go on.
7.  FM: Who do you feel your audience is?
Wale: Everybody, just everybody. I don’t have a target. Nothing I do is really calculated or strategic—I just speak with my heart.
8. FM: You have worked with a lot of bands that do not typically fall into the pop or hip-hop categories, such as TV on the Radio and Justice. Is there a reason that you are drawn to these artists?
Wale: No, I just like the music. I don’t really like putting things in a box. I just like what they do.
9. FM: What is your favorite track on your album “Attention Deficit”?
Wale: I recorded 35 songs for my album. Cutting it down to 14 was a task in itself, so I really couldn’t say that. I am low-key trying to do a video for every song because I am just so passionate about all of them. Maybe I am just overly passionate about my work.
10. FM: Would you say the videos for “Attention Deficit” are your next big project? What are you currently working on? What is your next big thing?
Wale: I am just trying to finish this tour so that I can get back to being creative 24/7. I am not at my finest moment as far as creativity goes right now.
11. FM: Do you collect anything?
Wale: Sneakers, a little bit.
12. FM: Which pair of sneakers is your favorite in your collection?
Wale: Probably my Foam Violets. I have been wearing them a lot recently, but a pair of shoes might be my favorite for like a month and then I’ll switch them.
13. FM: I saw the video of you freestyling at Denny’s. What were the circumstances leading up to the trip to Denny’s and what prompted your freestyle?
Wale: Way too much time on the tour bus.
14. FM: What is the craziest thing that a fan has ever done for you?
Wale: Flashed me...flashed me, yeah. Flashing is not so bad, though. Oh, you know what? I take that back. A fan gave me...what is the politically correct way to say this? She gave me her battery-operated boyfriend to sign at an autograph signing when my album came out.
15. FM: Do you have any advice for aspiring musicians?
Wale: You guys at Harvard are better off than me...or 99.9% of us rappers. There is no money in hip-hop, so if that is what your intentions are, you are in the wrong profession, but if you are in it for the love, God bless you.

Lingerie can be “a skimpy little layer of armor” and a confidence booster, according to Linda Ellison, Lecturer on Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality. If that’s the case, then Forty Winks, an eco-friendly lingerie store that opened on JFK Street last Friday, is a well-stocked armory.
Owner Rachel A. Wentworth and her close friend and business partner, Meredith W. Donaldson—both of whom used to work at Church Street’s Mint Julep—are looking to run a business that is kind to both the earth and to the customer.
The bright, airy, French country-themed boutique is stocked with thongs made of scraps of recycled silk and panties in organic cotton and bamboo.
“Our vision was to create a cozy environment where people would feel comfortable trying on intimate things,” said Wentworth. “It’s not a sexpot store. We’re not going for va va voom, boobs up to your chin. We want to work with real women who want quality, pretty lingerie.”
The store also carries some intricate, lacy sets that seem to register sex, and where there is supply there is inevitably demand. So whom do women wear lingerie for?
“Do it for yourself,” said Wentworth. “If you have a beautiful bra on underneath your outfit, it’s a powerful feeling.”
Ellison thinks that women wear lingerie not to be more attractive to a partner, but to feel sexy.
“I have a lot of it, and I don’t feel like it’s objectifying in the sense that we usually think of objectification,” she said. “I am an object of my own volition. I’m being respected, adored, sometimes loved.”
Ellison stressed that in the end, it’s our confidence, character, and charisma that keep us sexy to someone else.
“That’s why if you were to call a man back an hour after seeing him and ask him what you were wearing, he’ll say, ‘I can’t quite remember, but you were beautiful,’” she said. “What he’s recalling is your confidence, that extra layer of confidence that might have come from the fantastic bra you’re wearing.”

That college down in New Haven really is in a different world. Up until this school year, Yale undergraduates were permitted to engage in sexual relations with all faculty members but their own professors. Sadly, and after more than 25 years of debate, all special relationships between Yalies and faculty members are now prohibited, according to the April edition of the Yale Alumni Magazine.
So what’s the policy at Harvard?
According to the Sexual Harassment Guidelines for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, even when there is consent from both parties at the outset, “officers and other members of the teaching staff should be aware that any romantic involvement with their students makes them liable for formal action against them.”
Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 that said he is not absolutely certain what these consequences are. “But I do feel certain that it would not be left alone,” he said.
The reasoning is simple, according to Dingman. “There is a power imbalance,” he said. “It isn’t necessarily clear whether a student is in this voluntarily.”
Harvard’s stance that “relationships between officers and students are always fundamentally asymmetric in nature” means that the rules apply to teachers and students “outside the instructional context.” The guidelines note that a faculty member could unexpectedly be put in a position of responsibility for a student, including writing a letter of recommendation or serving on a selection committee for a student.
Dingman said that in his experience as Dean of Freshmen and Resident Dean of Leverett and Dudley Houses, he didn’t have to confront the issue of professor-student relationships.
“That doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened,” he added.
Dingman noted that when he was Resident Dean, students mentioned occasionally that a peer was in a relationship with a teaching fellow. It has also come up that an undergraduate was involved with a Resident Tutor. So what did Harvard do?
“That person was asked to give up being a tutor,” he said.

All restaurant spaces have karma: the ghosts of Z Square (may she rest in peace—the curried chicken salad or grilled cheese and tomato soup, anyone?), undeniably haunt the recently opened Russell House Tavern, the newest star in The Grafton Group’s constellation of other Harvard Square watering holes, Redline, Temple Bar, and Grafton Street. The black and white tiled floor, or those Xlerator hand dryers in the bathroom downstairs? Um, hello.
Similar to the original Z Square, the crucial dining decision is made at the door: up or down, asks the smiley, if slightly overeager, fleet of wait staff? With JFK-facing open windows and cushy leather stools (with backs) at the bar itself, stake out a spot upstairs for a bustling, lively dinner.
Beware of your tab, however: with an encyclopedic bar menu comprised of about 40 small production beers and more than 60 American wines, the lists made this oenophiliac and beer-drinking Slow Foodie feel like a kid in Hidden Sweets. Boston brewery Harpoon figures prominently in the draught and bottle departments (if you’re a fan of Blue Moon, try a glass of the Harpoon Belgian Pale Ale, $6), as does Pennsylvania brewery Victory, whose Storm King Imperial Stout at 9.1% ABV is a dark, delicious, and, let’s face it, dangerous road home. As it stands, the bar’s offerings of affordable wine by the glass are fairly limited, but this is bound to change once their “on tap” wine is up and running. Lest we forget cocktails, those listed under “Quintessential Classics” are well-priced and excellent, the Last Word and Moscow Mule both being green concoctions of Prohibition-era deliciousness.
As is true of a typical Italian menu, Executive Chef Michael Scelfo’s meals lead with a bang but peter off into mediocrity with the main courses. The restaurant’s self-professed catering to the college crowd is perhaps to blame for the enormous portion sizes: when in doubt, order the small plate version of a dish. Many of the appetizers and small plates are “eggcellent” (to quote one recent diner) thanks to the local and farm fresh eggs used for the steak tartare and crispy soft poached chip-in farm egg, the apotheosis of bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. The local leaf salad, lightly dressed with perfectly toasted walnuts and plump quarters of dried fig strewn throughout, would make a lovely, light supper. The “R. House Burger,” uniquely served on a griddled English muffin, is mean enough and only $10. The chilled lobster pot (which the waiter described as a “mini-cauldron”), abrasively seasoned and lacking in conceptual unity, left something to be desired, as did the hanger steak and pizzas. The entrées are, at best, solid, and the dessert menu has some serious holes: where’s the chocolate?
Treat the menu as glorified pub grub and you’re golden, at least for the time being while the restaurant works out its kinks in the way of service. Just order another bottle of the crispy and affordable Acrobat Pinot Gris from Oregon for the table and little else matters.

At Harvard, cooking usually means perfecting the ratio of milk to Cracklin’ Oat Bran in your bowl, so it’s no surprise that recent graduates often find themselves at a loss when faced with an actual stove and no Brain Break.  A class offered by Harvard University Dining Services aims to change that.
The class for graduating seniors is taught by HUDS Director for Culinary Operations Martin T. Breslin. It meets once a week in the belly of the beast—the HUDS central kitchen near Kirkland House.
“The goal is to explore the art of cooking, but also to learn to feed yourself at a very basic level,” said Jason J. Wong ’10, one of the students taking advantage of the program.
Cameron N. Spickert ’10 added, “I’m going to be living on my own, and I didn’t want to either starve or spend a lot of money on fast food.”
The class is taught to a group of about 15 seniors, who learn by preparing the food themselves.
“The meat of the class—if you’ll pardon the pun—is really to practice applying all the skills we are learning,” explained Wong.
Working in the HUDS kitchen is also unique to the class.  “It was the first time I had gotten a sense of just how much work it takes to feed more than 6,000 undergraduates,” said Hong Suk Yang ’10, a student in the class.
Though complaints about meals are common in d-halls across campus, many students have seized the opportunity to gain some of HUDS’ wisdom. As Alex Yang ’10 said, “Seeing the inner workings of HUDS made me gain a lot of respect for them.”
And after graduation? Those seniors who don’t take the class may just find themselves in hot water.

Bogotá, Colombia. 10 p.m. Having endured a three-hour Shabbat dinner during which my hosts repeatedly implied that my summer roommate was a bad Jew while pretending I didn’t exist, I left Chabad House thinking I had survived the most hostile encounter of my night. Ignoring the advice of our dinner companions and every other human we had met so far, we decided not to call a taxi and instead walked towards a nearby bar, hoping to unwind to the calming sounds of Daddy Yankee.
For the first eight blocks we commended ourselves on surviving both our dinner and our first week in Bogotá, despite my mother’s prediction that I wouldn’t make it past the airport without Pablo Escobar kidnapping me and demanding a ransom that she assured me she would not pay. So far, all seemed quiet on the kidnapping front. The rabbi, at least, seemed relieved to be rid of me.
As we were walking, we spotted the always-welcome figure of a hooded man walking out of a dark alley.
“Shit,” said my roommate, thoughtfully assessing the situation. I told him that he had read too many HUPD Community Advisories and laughed off his suggestion that we turn and run in the other direction. Bad things didn’t happen to me when I traveled. Sure, there was that time I almost inadvertently enlisted the services of a St. Lucian hooker. And that other time when an angry Czech masseuse ripped off my boxers after I failed to understand her Russian tirade. And maybe losing 50 pounds to a Guatemalan parasite wasn’t ideal, but I got to eat as many Big Macs as I wanted for five months. No, I told him, we did not need to run for our lives. Like I do with the Greenpeace volunteers in Harvard Square, I simply needed to politely decline the hooded figure’s request and go on my way.  I didn’t have five minutes to stop global warming, and I certainly didn’t have five minutes to get mugged.
Sadly, the man in the hoodie wasn’t on board with this plan. As I passed him, he grabbed the sleeve of my jacket, pulled out a knife, and said in a barely decipherable murmur, “Dame tu celular.” Like any non-freshman getting cold-called in section, my mind struggled to find the easiest way out of what was becoming my very first mugging. At this point, I would love to tell the story of how I used my enormous height advantage, the training acquired during my HUPD Rape Aggression Defense class, and the help of my valiant roommate to fight off my offender. But that would be a lie.
Instead, I raced to hand over my cell phone and cash while my roommate stood five feet away, doing nothing. It must’ve been the easiest 20,000 pesos that man had ever made. I’m not really sure how long this whole transaction took, but it was somewhere in the range of 60 seconds, and then it was done. I was mugged. I was stranded a hundred blocks from my apartment in a foreign city with nary a centavo. Would I have to become a drug mule and smuggle ten pounds of cocaine in my body in order to leave the country? Would the rabbi let me back into his house? The first seemed likelier.
To compensate for doing absolutely nothing during the actual mugging, my roommate did buy me lots of cervezas to lower my heart rate back to a healthy level. But even this normally foolproof tactic failed, and when we got back to our apartment (which thankfully had a bulletproof door), I still couldn’t sleep. The next day, I refused to leave the apartment. The day after, I ran out of a grocery store convinced that the 60-year-old grandmother who had been standing at the meat counter next to me was only biding her time before jumping me. For several weeks, my irrational paranoia led me to believe that any stranger within two miles of me was almost certainly a sociopath waiting to pilfer my vintage Nokia. For the rest of the summer, I only visited the ATM wearing running shoes so that I could sprint the three blocks back to my apartment. Logically, I knew that the odds of getting mugged again were about the same as going to Friday morning lecture, but I couldn’t shake this feeling that everyone around me was waiting to pounce, and not in the good way.
Giving someone your money because they are threatening to hurt you is no fun, and kind of expensive, and maybe I still get rattled when I see little old ladies standing too close to me. But in some ways, I’m glad the whole mugging thing happened. Going about my daily routine—Adams, Class, Lamont, Kong, Nausea, Adams—is nice. But every so often you need crazy experiences to liven things up a little, like drunkenly hailing a Boston cop car that had more than a passing resemblance to a taxi, or getting mugged in Colombia.
Maybe going into Boston or a different Chinese food restaurant would suffice, but for extreme guys like myself, sometimes you need a little international petty theft to mix things up. And the story makes a great pick-up line.

Lindsey M. Parker ’10 has cut down his extracurriculars this semester because, as he says, “It’s nice to have time just to spend with my wife and enjoy senior spring.”
Parker, now 25, married Stephanie Brinton Parker ’10 this past summer, and the pair now lives in Peabody Terrace, a Harvard-affiliated building behind Mather House, due to prohibitions against married students living in upperclass Houses. Parker is grateful he deferred his admission for two years before starting freshman year—otherwise, he wouldn’t have been in the same class as Brinton, and they likely wouldn’t have married or even dated.
Parker’s two-year deferral was spent in Poland, serving as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “The basic thing we were trying to teach was that we are all sons and daughters of God,” Parker explains. “Our specific message for the Church of Latter-day Saints—the Mormon church—in our day, [is that] God has restored His true, existing Church onto the earth and in that Church contained the ordinances, all the teaching necessary for salvation.”
BORN TO GO
Mormon men between the ages of 19 and 25 are expected to complete a two-year mission in an assigned location, barring a prohibitive physical condition. Parker was born into the church and says he’s always known he wanted to go on a mission. “When you’re a little kid, you think, ‘I’m going to be cool like the missionaries that came to dinner.’ But it’s a big jump from saying ‘I’m going to serve’ when you’re eight years old to being 19 and, ‘I have to fill out these papers, and I have to get my dental check and I have to go.’”
“There’s definitely the issue of, if you don’t go, how will the rest of the church view me?” reflects Chad R. Cannon ’11. The 24-year-old returned to Harvard after completing the Fukuoka (“be careful with spelling,” he chides) mission in Japan. “I felt a sense of duty,” Cannon recalls, “but ultimately it became my desire.”
Douglas C. Muhlestein ’13-’15 won’t find out his exact assignment until April or May, but his dad and nine uncles all went on missions and he can’t wait. “The Gospel and my family are the two things in my life that are most important to me and bring me the most happiness,” he says. “So how great would it be to spend two years sharing my favorite thing with everyone I can?”
Serving on a mission is a mainly male responsibility within the Mormon Church, while “fellowshipping”—essentially serving a nurturing role to church members—is expected of females. But Muhlestein’s older sister, Whitney E. Muhlestein ’10, will also leave for her mission this summer. Girls are allowed to serve starting when they’re 21, which Muhlestein attributes to safety concerns, but also to the distinct appeals an older, more mature female might hold for potential believers. Muhlestein says her dad is very adamant about all his children serving on missions, but her decision was her own: she intends to go to graduate school or medical school after she gets back, “years where there won’t really be time to stop and focus entirely on my relationship with God, which I know is always the most important thing.”
She says that the prospect of being one of the very few females on her mission doesn’t bother her at all. “I do science, which is a little male dominated,” she says.
BACK TO SCHOOL
Cannon’s Harvard admission was deferred a year, and now that he’s back from his mission, he’s three years older than many people in his graduating class. Being so much older than his classmates was one of his main concerns, but Cannon says he doesn’t feel that out of place because he’s met a lot of Harvard students who have taken longer to graduate.
When he returned to school as a sophomore, Cannon found it hard to readjust to the schedule because during his mission, every hour of the day was planned for him. “When you come back, you’re thrown back into normal social things like dating and being exposed to the media,” Cannon says. “You realize when you can’t watch television how much of the things you think of as being socially normal come from what you see in the media.” Cannon asserts nonetheless that his mission experience improved his Harvard life. “It’s a good wake up call to what life is actually about,” Cannon says.
“It’s not just academics and work. Those things are great and really important, but it’s also really helpful to have spent that much time thinking about what a lot of people have in their hearts.”
Douglas Muhlestein considered waiting to start freshman year until after he had completed his mission, but didn’t want his first away-from-home experience to be for two straight years, with only four phone calls total (on Christmas Day and Mother’s Day), and no TV or movies allowed. Muhlestein intends to concentrate in computer science, and he says he’s not worried about disrupting his academic plans. “Harvard is really good at letting you leave,” he explains. “They say it’s easier to take two years off than to drop a class.”
Muhlestein says that his mission has served as a recurring conversation topic throughout his freshman year, especially amongst peers who are curious about such a big commitment to one’s faith. Though he believes that the general reaction to his decision is one of admiration and respect, Muhlestein muses: “People are always asking, ‘What house are you in next year?’ ‘Oh, well, I’m in Lowell House...a few years down the road.’”

When I decided to join a final club, my mother was not pleased. Her voice tinged with disappointment as she asked how her son could participate in something so steeped in racist, elitist, sexist privilege. I countered that white skin and blue blood were no longer club membership requirements. But she wasn’t sold. What about the women? She persisted. After a few abortive rationalizations, I realized I had no good answer. I was embarrassed.
Now, I’ve become convinced that every other club member should be too. Our decision to deny admission to half of the student body solely on account of gender is every bit as unjust as our forebears’ practice of barring candidates because they were black, Jewish, or gay. It needs to end.
While the rest of the world moves towards gender equality, Harvard’s eight all-male final clubs have stubbornly remained on the wrong side of history. Two decades ago, the last of Princeton’s eating clubs discontinued its practice of gender discrimination after a protracted legal battle that included two failed appeals to the Supreme Court. The next year, Skull and Bones, Yale’s famous secret society, voted to accept women following a contentious public fight that pitted renowned grads like John F. Kerry and William F. Buckley, Jr. against one another. But somehow, the winds of change that blew up the coast from New Jersey to New Haven never made it all the way to Cambridge. In 1984, the College gave the clubs an ultimatum: Either admit women, or get off campus. They unanimously chose the second option. Then, in 1987, Lisa J. Schkolnick ’88 sued the Fly Club for unlawful discrimination, but a Massachusetts court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to force integration. Schkolnick almost got her wish anyway, though: In 1993, the undergraduate membership of the Fly voted unanimously to go co-ed, only to reverse its decision and choose “club unity over women” a year later after its graduate board strategically delayed the process in order to allow opinion to shift. Since then, both the Fox and the Spee have also had undergraduate majorities vote in favor of going co-ed, only to be stymied by tradition-touting grad boards.
This unwillingness to embrace change has profound and pernicious effects on College life. The clubs’ discriminatory membership policies place the accumulated wealth, real estate, and prestige of dozens of generations in the hands of men alone—and at a school with limited social space, this imbalance warps gender relations into something out of a Jane Austen novel.
Criticism of final club sexism is often conflated with attacks on the clubs as a whole—this creates a strident tone of debate to which club members react defensively. I don’t want to fall into this trap. Instead, I hope to outline some of the meaningful consequences that emerge from the eight all-male clubs’ refusal to admit women, most of which I have observed from my own experience. Because when polemic is cast aside, a powerful truth emerges: the system is simply incompatible with what final club members should—and in fact mostly do—believe about gender and justice.
THE WAGES OF DISCRIMINATION
Schuyler H. Daum ’12 is the kind of girl that female final clubs fight over during punch season. But this fall it dawned on her that something wasn’t quite right with the world that accepted her so readily. "My best friends have been boys since the time I was born," she notes. In a social scene divided by gender, however, she went from companion to guest. "I’d get invited over for Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights," Daum found, but her male hosts would never accept her—or any "her," for that matter—as a true equal deserving of membership. "The most insulting part about it is that they’re saying ‘I don’t want you in my club,’" she told me. "It makes me feel like a second-class citizen."
Schuyler is notable because she is willing to speak openly about the interplay of gender and power at Harvard final clubs. But her experience is not uncommon. The dominance of single-sex social institutions creates a variety of unsavory consequences for many women across this campus.
Of course, these consequences don’t necessarily apply to everyone. Final clubs are just one side of a multifaceted social scene. Only 15 percent of students belong, and while many more are loosely affiliated, a decent number of undergrads make it through their entire four years at Harvard without ever stepping through one of the clubs’ heavy wooden doors. But the existence of alternatives does not eliminate the problem. Many women may not participate in final club culture, but many others do—as long as some suffer from gender discrimination, the issue is not resolved. And while it might seem that students could simply cut clubs out of their social lives, this request is not as reasonable as it sounds.
A reporter supposedly once asked the legendary criminal Willie Sutton why he robbed banks. "Because that’s where the money is," the gangster replied. A similar answer could be given to anyone who questions why women continue to frequent the clubs that exclude them: that’s where the parties are. Final clubs have unfettered access to social space that simply doesn’t exist outside their walls. Telling women (or men) who are sick of segregation to just go somwhere else doesn’t cut it because there really isn’t anywhere else at Harvard quite like the final clubs. With House life under close administrative scrutiny and most of the student body under the legal drinking age, final clubs are in a position of unique power.
Therefore, as long as final club injustices exist, they can’t simply be written off as irrelevant to the larger Harvard social community.
And injustices abound. At the most basic level, all-male final clubs distribute resources in strange and unfair ways. Membership comes with perks—mansions, dinners, alumni networks—none of which go to women. It is dubious to give men privileged access to all of these important benefits, and because of the dynamics of social space at Harvard, this inequity spawns many others.
All-male final clubs carve out a corner of the social world that revolves around the preferences of men, and men alone. Men plan the parties. Men decide who gets in and who does not. Women are left to suffer the consequences.
"[As a woman], your time at Harvard is planned by other people, constructed by other people," one female undergraduate recounts (unlike Schuyler, most students are reluctant to talk about this issue on the record, which in and of itself speaks volumes). As a result, from the day they arrive, female freshmen are faced with the fact that their place in a certain part of Harvard’s social hierarchy will depend on how they are evaluated by their male classmates. "You can literally be excluded from the social scene based on how men perceive you your freshman year," says one female senior. As an unavoidable consequence, "If you’re a pretty girl, you get so much further than someone who is not attractive."
This imbalance of control creates a perverse need for women to curry favor with the men who make the lists. "As a girl, you feel all this social anxiety," another female senior says. "You constantly need to manage your relationships with your male friends in clubs to make sure you don’t get left by the wayside." This dependence consistently and systematically puts women into situations they should never have to experience. A female student explains that the need to remain on final club lists "has sustained certain friendships with guys who are constantly hosting me, who otherwise I wouldn’t be friends with." Romantic relationships are even more problematic—break up with your final club boyfriend, and you might find your social life in jeopardy, as too many women I know have discovered the hard way.
Even the most sought-after girls, who never struggle to gain admission to exclusive parties, get, as Schuyler aptly put it, "second-class citizenship" in the final club nation. A world of male hosts and female guests creates a fundamental asymmetry in gender relations. Women can’t return the hospitality that is constantly bestowed upon them. Since they don’t have social space of their own to give or withhold, they’re simply expected to, as one female student put it, "smile and look pretty."
This anachronistic system perpetuates an old-fashioned and destructive conception of gender at Harvard. Men are the providers—they pay for the clubs, assume the liability for the parties, plan and make decisions. Women, meanwhile, are passive recipients of this largesse, always subject to the whims of their male classmates.
Schuyler told me about the moment when this inequality dawned on her. At a club with her friends, she realized: "It was very subtle, but the girls had this feeling that if I do this, these boys will think I’m fun, and they need to think I’m fun because I need to be invited to these parties, and this is where the parties are."
It is strange and sad that in the 21st century, at a place like Harvard, this is how the most intelligent, successful, capable women in the world have to interact with their male classmates.
SEPARATE BUT EQUAL?
In recent years, as the movement to integrate final clubs has sputtered out, efforts to remedy these problems have come to focus on creating all-female social space to serve as a counterweight to the male clubs. The trend began in 1991, when the Bee was founded with the help of Porcellian grads who wanted to grant their daughters something resembling the social experience they had enjoyed in college. By the late 1990s, the Seneca (not technically a final club, but founded with the express purpose of changing Harvard gender dynamics) had joined the mix. With the new millennium came the Isis, the Sabliere, the Pleiades, and most recently, La Vie. Many of these clubs are empowering in both intent and effect. In her young organization’s constitution, La Vie founder Oluwadara A. Johnson ’10 gives a dramatic account of its beginnings: "On a cold winter day in January 2008, I decided that it was time to take an active step towards bridging the gender inequality gap that exists in the Harvard social scene." Her group, and others like it, have had some measure of success in righting wrongs, especially now that several women’s clubs occupy their own real estate.
But there are limits to this "separate but equal" approach. The first is that women’s clubs will find it difficult to compensate for their male counterparts’ 219-year head start. The opportunities for acquiring wealth and real estate that existed in the late 19th century—when the last of the eight surviving men’s clubs was founded—have vanished with a bygone era. Properties like those owned by the male clubs just don’t come on the market any more, and to the extent they do, the cost is often prohibitively high (see last year’s 45 Mt. Auburn Street fiasco for an example of how tricky purchasing Harvard Square real estate can be). Currently, the two most well-heeled female clubs—the Bee and the Isis—rent their space from the Fly and the Owl, respectively. It is possible that male and female clubs will one day stand on equal footing, but the process could literally take centuries, and as activists have noted before, justice too long delayed is justice denied.
Moreover, even if the pipe dream of equal resources were attainable, creating more single-sex social space still wouldn’t address all aspects of the problem. One of the most unfortunate consequences of the current system is that it institutionalizes gender divisions, reinforcing the idea that men and women are fundamentally different. This promotes a culture in which men are friends with men, and women are friends with women. Neither group is encouraged to interact with the other as equals. The consequences of this are far-reaching. "It’s not surprising that men feel more comfortable approaching other men with a business idea because we’re taught to associate with members of the same gender," notes Katherine C. Harris ’10. No matter how many female final clubs spring up to challenge the primacy of the Mt. Auburn Street mansions, as long as men and women continue to socialize in segregated space, these barriers will never completely be leveled.
DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO
The only real solution is for the male clubs to do what they should have done a long time ago: accept women. The problem is that many club members don’t think this is a very good idea. When confronted with the fact that half of the student body is automatically excluded from their social institutions, most final club members don’t share my lack for words; instead, they respond with a number of justifications for the status quo, some with more merit than others.
Many cavalierly dismiss objections by asserting that final clubs are just like fraternities at other schools. I’m not entirely sure that this is true—the concentration of wealth and power in Harvard’s clubs seems fairly unique—but even if it were, the argument is unpersuasive since the potential existence of similar injustices on other campuses is not a particularly compelling reason to tolerate injustice here.
The primary defense offered up by single-sex advocates, however, is that there is something important about all-male social space—something that would be lost in a world of co-ed clubs. One final club president told me that he enjoys "having a space on campus where you can interact with just your own sex," and that he finds a "value in male camaraderie." Variations of this theme surface again and again in conversations with club members. Many express concern that with the introduction of women, cohesion, tight membership bonds, and institutional respect would all vanish. They often grow uncomfortable when asked how the current ban on women is any different from past forms of exclusion, such as keeping out blacks and Jews, but most settle on the argument that, unlike race or religion, gender is a "real" distinction.As we all learned in preschool, boys and girls are indeed different. But are these differences significant enough to preclude the possibility of co-ed social clubs? Would anyone’s experience truly be impoverished by gender-mixing?
One place to look for answers is Harvard’s peer institutions, Princeton and Yale, both of which possess old, powerful, exclusive social clubs that integrated about two decades ago. These schools’ students do not seem to spend their time pining for the single-sex days of yesteryear. Geoff C. Shaw, a senior at Yale, says that "cohesive would be one of the first words to come to mind" when describing Yale’s co-ed secret societies. Under gender segregation, he believes the clubs would be compromised. "You’d be missing out on the contributions of half the population," he says.
Two Princeton seniors I spoke with articulated similar sentiments. Giovanna Campagna, who is in Princeton’s tony Ivy Club—one of the last to integrate—told me that having co-ed clubs "makes the whole social world more gender-balanced—it’s not like a bunch of guys can rule the scene." She is unequivocal about her preference for gender integration: "I wouldn’t want to be in an all-girls eating club," she says firmly. Lizzie Presser, another senior and a member of the Terrace Club, also found the claim that only single-sex clubs could flourish difficult to accept. When asked whether she prefers having co-ed social institutions, she answers: "Absolutely; there’s no question." She adds: "It’s so easy for this place to feel like a man’s school because of its history, which makes it really important to have co-ed eating clubs."
Preferences are molded by experience, so it’s possible that current Yale and Princeton students value co-ed clubs simply because they’ve never known anything else. But it seems much more likely that Harvard’s single-sex defenders are plagued by status quo bias.
Opponents of integration are right to claim that final clubs wouldn’t be the same after they went co-ed, yet they forget that not all changes are for the worse. When new arrivals break an organization’s homogeneity, something gets left behind, because it’s easier to exist in an environment free from the tensions created by difference. But ultimately, the inclusion of more diverse perspectives also makes for a richer community, and this gain more than compensates for the discomfort of no longer being surrounded by faces that look just like your own. Final clubs were surely more "cohesive" in a certain sense back when they admitted only the Andover-bred scions of wealthy white families, but it was a lazy cohesion sustained by uniformity, and few express a desire to return to those days.
Final clubs eventually learned to thrive with Jews, blacks, homosexuals, and all sorts of other people who would have once been considered incompatible with the Rockefellers and Morgans who filled club dining rooms. The past teaches us that distinctions between people that appear fundamental at the time may in fact rest on dubious assumptions. Throughout history, well-meaning individuals have believed that the introduction of new elements into their social communities would ruin something important, but time and time again, history has proven them wrong.
THE PAST AND THE FUTURE
On December 7, 1922, Roscoe Conkling Bruce, a black Harvard graduate from the class of 1902, wrote to Abbott Lawrence Lowell, class of 1877 and the University’s 22nd President, to ask whether his son might be allowed to reside in a previously all-white freshman dorm. Lowell was a self-described "friend of the negro," but this request seemed clearly beyond the pale. "I am sure you will understand," wrote Lowell to the concerned father, "why we have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to live together."
Roscoe Conkling Bruce did not understand, and neither do we. In hindsight, it is clear that what Lowell saw as essential differences between blacks and whites significant enough to preclude important types of social interaction were really nothing more than the collected prejudices of generations.
I think that there’s a bit of Lowell’s fallacy in every club member who asserts that, while he firmly believes in gender equality, he still finds it important to preserve his claim to men’s-only space. He, like Lowell, fails to note that bringing different types of people together in the social realm is not only possible, but beneficial.
I hope that every final club member will consider this possibility, and think carefully about whether the institutions he helps perpetuate are in line with his convictions about gender and justice.
Because as hard as I found it to explain the necessity of male dominance over Harvard’s social space to my mother, just wait 20 years. Try explaining it to your daughter.

After undergoing a competitive process, over 50 new resident tutors have been hired across the 12 residential Houses to join the Senior Common Rooms and participate in House leadership next year.
More than 300 applicants contended for these spots, typically held by Harvard or MIT graduate students who receive free room and board in exchange for monitoring and advising undergraduates.
The surge in the number of applicants in recent years—which some attributed to the poor economic climate—has made it more difficult for interested individuals to obtain a post as resident tutor.
“I think it’s generally been really competitive this year and for the last few years,” said Cabot House resident tutor Richard R. Johnston, who interviewed some of the candidates for the position in Cabot.
Applicants were permitted to apply to every House—an option practiced by many of the resident tutor aspirants, according to Currier House Allston Burr Resident Dean Katherine Stanton.
Adams House had 322 applicants, a number that was fairly consistent across Houses that disclosed the number of tutor candidates. Lowell boasted 311 applicants, while Kirkland had 316.
The number of tutor hires varied across the Houses to account for the existing resident tutors who, set to complete their academic programs, will soon leave the Houses—Winthrop House had no turnover in resident tutors, in contrast to Adams’ nine new hires.
“Departures tend to come in waves depending on when tutors start and finish their programs,” wrote Pforzheimer House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86 in an e-mailed statement about their House’s turnover in resident tutors. “Two years ago, one tutor left; last year seven moved on.”
Candidates flock to fill these positions because of “a very strong desire to be part of a residential community,” said Lowell House resident tutor Van C. Tran.
“It depends on whether you like hanging with undergraduate students, because if you do it’s a sweet deal and it’s personally kind of rewarding,” said Currier House resident tutor Kurt J. Gray. “And if you don’t it would be hell.”

In a discussion about the changing job market, Harvard Law School Professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 advised third-year Law School students on how to best utilize the skills they have learned at HLS once they enter the field.
Feldman, who spoke yesterday as a part of the Class of 2010 Faculty Speaker Series, detailed the effects of the recent financial crisis on major private law firms.
While the overall nature of these jobs has not changed, lawyers should use the crisis as motivation to advise their clients—especially those in the financial sector—in a more cautious manner, Feldman said.
He warned that there may be fewer job opportunities for Law School graduates and that students might be furloughed after being hired—but acquiring a job is not the only concern, he added.
Feldman said that recent Law School graduates can often become disillusioned and feel like they have “no impact on the way the machine is working.”
The solution, Feldman said, is to develop a better understanding of the given law firm’s structure and then think of ways to improve the system as a “self-conscious, thinking person.” New lawyers should then articulate and voice these ideas, Feldman stressed.
He said that young lawyers should not be afraid to ask questions and express their opinions as they use the language of the law they have learned at Harvard.
Feldman said that he feels there is a lack of hierarchy in major private law firms, which encourages the kind of communicative exchange that he seeks to encourage between the graduating students and their future partners.
The Law School has prepared its students with the tools they need to understand the legal world and to effect “incremental change,” Feldman said.
The students need to move beyond the instruction provided at the Law School to create change in the real world and “to not assuage anxiety but meet it head-on,” he said.
The speaker series concludes next Wednesday with a speech by Law School Professor and HLS graduate Carol S. Steiker ’82.

Wearing tri-corner hats, waving American flags, and holding signs that read “April 15th is Government Rape Day,” a crowd gathered yesterday morning on Boston Common in anxious anticipation of former U.S. Vice Presidential candidate Sarah L. Palin.
When the former governor of Alaska did arrive at the so-called “Tea Party” rally—one of a series of anti-Obama administration protests in the last year which takes its name from the Boston Tea Party—she delivered her anti-big government message behind a sea of cameras and reporters.
“Where are you, Sarah?” shouted a group of admiring fans from among the thousands that convened on the Common. “Sarah, we want to see you!”
Palin gave a speech which encouraged the people to criticize—and eventually vote against—the current administration of “change we can believe in.”
“We’ll keep clinging to our constitution and our guns and our religion,” Palin said. “And you can keep your change.”
Palin emphasized what she characterized as the unfair taxation burden the average American family currently faces due to government spending.
She said that the debt could have detrimental consequences for future generations and accused the administration of President Barack Obama for “stealing opportunity in this land of opportunity,” as well as stating that the deficit makes the U.S. more dependent on other nations.
“It makes us less secure. It makes us less free,” Palin said, referring to the debt. “And I’m not calling anyone un-American, but the unintended consequences of these actions, the results, are un-American.”
Palin’s reference to taxation was particularly timely given that today is what Palin called “the day that the taxman cometh”—the day when all Americans file their taxes.
In addition to addressing fiscal concerns, the main focus of the Tea Party, Palin riled up the crowd with a cry for off-shore drilling.
“Let’s drill, baby, drill!” she said. “God knows we have the resources. He created them for our use right here in America.”
Throughout the rally, both cheers and boos could be heard.
“I think she’s a good motivator,” said Newton resident Jack Levis, who added that he resented Obama for “spending away our future.”
Boston resident Dan Brackett, who also praised Palin for her speech, added that he was pleased with the rally overall.
“It’s great to see that the party’s starting to catch on,” he said. “I came here to support the party, to fight against taxation without representation.”
Yet a significant group came to the Common to protest Palin’s message.
“I came here to show my displeasure with the Tea Party movement, which is basically racist,” said Joan Quigley, a resident of Stoughton, Mass.
One anti-Palin group hosted near the entrance of Boston Common an alternative gathering called “the real Boston tea party,” at which tea and cookies were served.
“It started as a joke,” said Kathleen Toomey, who organized the gathering. “But then we thought what better way to show that the Tea Party movement doesn’t speak for every American than to have a nice, polite tea party?”
Yesterday’s rally was part of the “Tea Party Express,” a national bus tour that organizes “Tea Party” rallies. The tour started in Nevada in March and ends in Washington D.C. today.

Harvard Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz has agreed to serve on the defense team of R. Allen Stanford, who was arrested last June after allegations of his involvement in a Ponzi scheme.
Though he is still awaiting trial, Stanford is currently in prison. Dershowitz said that his main role in the case is to fight Stanford’s incarceration, which he says is not consistent with the Constitution.
“He’s being unconstitutionally treated,” Dershowitz said. “The Constitution provides for bail, and he has been denied bail...in a manner that doesn’t permit him to prepare his defense.”
Dershowitz, who has held his current post as the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law since 1993, has a history of defending notable—and perhaps notorious—clients.
Famously, he was part of the O.J. Simpson defense team during the double-homicide trial.
Still, Dershowitz noted that his role will be limited in Stanford’s case.
“I’m only involved in the issue of whether it’s proper to keep him in jail pending his trial,” he said.
J. Lorand Matory ’82—a former professor at Harvard with whom Dershowitz had a long and well-publicized feud—seemed to express some philosophical support for his former colleague. Matory is now the chair of the African and African American Studies department at Duke University.
“I believe every person is innocent until proven guilty and an accused person is entitled to a vigorous defense,” Matory said.
“I hope more attorneys commit themselves to guaranteeing that all defendants have the best defense that they can get,” he added.
Dershowitz repeatedly emphasized that the case represents a legal issue beyond the realm of Stanford’s case.
He also expressed an interest in bringing the case before the Supreme Court, though he conceded the difficulty of managing a timetable to move it through the court system.
“I would think that if the Supreme Court heard his case, they would not tolerate two years of detention based on the information that’s been presented,” Dershowitz said.
“It undercuts the whole criminal justice system, which is why I became interested in the case.”

Admission into Harvard Kennedy School has grown slightly more competitive, with the acceptance rate falling from 21.5 percent to just under 20 percent this year.
Over the past two years, the number of applications to the Kennedy School’s Master in Public Policy Program has increased by 34 percent, according to Alexandra Martinez, the school’s director of admissions and enrollment management.
Martinez said that the Kennedy School’s evaluation of admissions statistics is based on the two-year MPP program—the school’s largest degree program that prepares students for futures in public service.
The number of applicants to the MPP program increased by 5 percent this year, boasting a total of 1,729 applicants. From this pool, 345 students were admitted.
“This is still a record number of applications,” Martinez said, adding that she hopes the number of applicants will continue to rise.
The average newly admitted student is 26-years-old and has had three years of work experience.
Twenty percent of the accepted students this year hail from international backgrounds. The percentage of applicants from international backgrounds rose from 29 to 31 percent this year.
“Everybody I talked to had a different background,” said Regan Turner, who was recently accepted to the Kennedy School after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan as a U.S. Marine captain. “The students represent every previous career imaginable from myself being a military officer to people who worked in the non-profit sector.”
Jaime Loucky, another recent admit, said he was less certain about attending the Kennedy School in the fall.
“Although [the Kennedy School] has an enormous diversity of course offerings, a very large and sterling faculty, and an equally impressive student body...there are a number of weaknesses that I am keeping in mind,” said Loucky, who has also been accepted to Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.
“I haven’t quite made up my mind, but I’m leaning toward Harvard,” Loucky added.

Harvard Business School’s publishing arm has recently restructured itself to streamline the editorial process in response to the changing nature of the publishing industry.
HBS professors who wish to publish a scholarly work will first contact publishing staffers in their subject area, who will then ensure that the work is published through several different media outlets—such as books, the Web, and the Harvard Business Review.
To that end, publishing staffers have been newly organized into topic-specific teams, or “idea chains,” in order to streamline the editorial process, according to Director of HBS Publishing Activities Howard H. Stevenson.
In an e-mail to HBS staff and faculty in November, Business School Dean Jay O. Light wrote that “despite some positive indicators,” HBS Publishing “still faces significant industry-wide challenges.”
The scholarly publishing industry has faced significant financial setbacks over the past few years.
In light of the closing of Harvard University Press’ display room in the Holyoke Center, HUP sales director Susan Donnelly said to The Crimson last July that publishers have been dealt a “double-whammy” by the financial crisis and the transition to digital media.
But administrators—including Stevenson and Raymond Carvey, senior vice president and chief operating officer of HBS Publishing—said that the restructuring was motivated by the changing nature of the publishing industry rather than financial concerns.
Carvey said that the publishing house has brought all its products—including the Harvard Business Review and the case studies taught in HBS classes—under one umbrella.
HBS professors will no longer have to “hunt around”—instead, they will “have a home,” Carvey said.
HBS Assistant Professor Romana L. Autrey said that professors will now be able to coordinate their work with one team “instead of having to form new relationships every time we publish new material.”
Light has given guidance to HBS Publishing to help it evolve with the changing media landscape, according to Carvey.
Stevenson noted that any additional profits will be used to invest in the publishing house and faculty research.
“We want to have a greater income to better serve our customers,” Stevenson said. “Like the Business School as a whole, we are fundamentally an educational institution.”
Carvey said that these new innovations will help HBS Publishing be “the globally recognized publisher of great management ideas.”

Former Expository Writing Preceptor Paul Harding won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his debut novel “Tinkers” on Tuesday.
The Pulitzer Board praised Harding’s novel as “a powerful celebration of life in which a New England father and son, through suffering and joy, transcend their imprisoning lives and offer new ways of perceiving the world and mortality.”
Expository Writing Senior Preceptor and Harding’s former colleague Karen L. Heath acknowledged that while it is rare for an author to receive the prestigious award for his first novel, Paul’s award was well deserved.
“He is a terrific writer, and we were really thrilled to hear that he had gotten that honor,” Heath said.
Jane Rosenzweig, director of the Writing Center and a former colleague of Harding’s, said that it is often “quite a struggle” for an author to get his work published, and it may take a while for people to recognize its value.
But when they do, she said, “it’s just a wonderfully gratifying experience for everyone.”
“Paul has a wonderful ear for prose,” said Christina A. Thompson who, as editor of the Harvard Review, published Harding’s short story “Walter, Charmed” in the spring of 2002.
Before Harding left in 2008 to serve as a visiting assistant professor at the University of Iowa, Harding taught Expository Writing 20, “The Art of Short Fiction” for seven years.
His colleagues noted not only Harding’s talent for writing, but also his rigorous teaching style.
“He’s an intellectually demanding instructor with high expectations for his students,” Rosenzweig wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Rosenzweig said that when students would ask Harding why they were asked to read a story by American novelist John Cheever, he would always tell them to go back to the text until they understood the motivation behind the assignment and could discover its meaning for themselves.
Harding’s award will serve as a reminder of the numerous creative and talented people teaching in the Harvard College Writing Program, said Rosenzweig, noting that “students don’t often have a chance to learn about the work their Expos preceptors are doing outside of class until it becomes public in some way.”
Harding is not the only Harvard affiliate to have won the Pulitzer Prize this year.
Gene Weingarten, a Nieman Fellow from 1987 to 1988, won the prize for journalism and Liaquat A. Ahamed, who graduated from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1978, won the prize for history.

Excessive alcohol consumption in young women may increase the risk of benign breast disease at an early age, according to a Harvard Medical School study.
The study found that young women—typically in their high school and college years—who drink in great quantities are 50 percent more likely to develop benign breast disease before the age of 30. BBD is a common condition featuring noncancerous changes in breast tissue.
In 1996, questionnaires were sent to over 9,000 girls around the country between the ages of nine and 15. Follow-up questionnaires—which included alcohol as one of the many survey topics—were sent to women over the course of many years.
In the 2005 and 2007 questionnaires, the women were asked whether they had been diagnosed with BBD, according to Catherine S. Berkey, co-author of the study.
The data revealed that the women who consumed seven drinks a week were 50 percent more likely to develop BBD before the age of 30. Women who consumed alcohol more than three days a week were also at a greater risk for BBD.
The study—which was published online in the journal “Pediatrics”—defined a drink as a beer, a glass of wine, a mixed drink, or a shot.
Berkey said that the recent findings and other studies conducted at Harvard suggest a correlation between alcohol consumption in women and increased risks of breast cancer—and the study suggests that “the risk may extend down to younger ages.”
But the possibility of the increased risk cannot be measured exactly through the recent study, and follow-up would be necessary to obtain further information, according to Berkey, a lecturer at Harvard Medical School and a research associate at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
“We will continue follow-ups of these females as more of them are diagnosed with BBD,” Berkey said. “We will investigate other factors that may affect their risk.”
Several female undergraduates said that the study would not have an overwhelming effect in changing the behavior and drinking habits of college-aged women.
Adeola Salau ’13 said that people often do not stop to consider all the consequences of their actions.
“I think that people tend to live in the moment and don’t evaluate all the potential consequences especially if the initial effects are so satisfying,” Salau said.

Mark Wu ’96, who has been appointed assistant professor at Harvard Law School, will bring his expertise in international economic and trade law with a focus on East Asia.
“Mark stands out because of his superb expertise, creativity, and extraordinary knowledge of Japan, China and India,” said Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in a press release.
“His special knowledge of intellectual property and protection in the borderless world of the digital space will significantly advance the exciting work by faculty and students here,” she added.
Previously, Wu held a two-year fellowship at Columbia Law School and co-authored “The Law of the World Trade Organization.”
Wu said that he is excited to join the faculty because he feels that “Harvard is one of the leaders in pioneering international law for its students.”
According to Law School professor William P. Alford, student interest in international law, and East Asia in particular, has risen dramatically in recent years.
Though the Law School has emphasized international law since its founding, it has in recent years increased its course offerings in international law and required students to take an international law course in their first year, according to Alford.
Both Alford and Wu have a specialized interest in China, and Alford said that he is looking forward to welcoming a colleague with similar interests to the faculty.
“It will be good to have someone else with complementary expertise,” Alford said. “[Wu] is a valuable resource.”
Though Wu’s teaching schedule has not been confirmed, he said he will most likely be teaching an international economic law course to second- and third-year law students.
“I am very excited to become a member of a community that has such a rich collection of dynamic and talented individuals in one place,” Wu said.
Wu said he is also excited to move his family to Cambridge and to give his two children access to opportunities at Harvard and around Boston.
Wu, who concentrated in Social Studies and East Asian Studies at Harvard, was one of the founders of the Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations. He was a resident of the Currier House “ten-man” suite.
As an undergraduate, Wu said he was unsure about his professional goals, but his experiences at Harvard sparked an interest in international affairs.
“Harvard undergrad was key in exposing me to international economic issues and how countries other than the U.S. behave and participate in the global order,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeannie Suk, a senior fellow at the Humanities Center, discussed at the Barker Center last night how the threat of psychological trauma experienced by women has affected the abortion debate.
Suk, who is also an assistant professor at Harvard Law School, explained that the awareness of the potential trauma experienced by women has been used on both sides of the abortion issue.
The discourse about women’s psychological trauma first entered the legal conversation concerning abortion with the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, in which pro-choice proponents argued that abortions could prevent the distress caused by an unwanted childbirth, according to Suk.
But after Gonzales v. Carhart in 2007, psychological trauma has appeared in common legal decisions as an argument against abortion, Suk said.
Gonzales v. Carhart signaled a move in Supreme Court jurisdiction toward a restriction of abortion rights, and it drew a connection between the threat of psychological trauma and partial-birth abortion.
Attendee J. Shoshanna Ehrlich, a Women’s Studies professor at University of Massachusetts Boston, questioned whether this shift in the discussion of psychological trauma was actually more indicative of an “effort to re-galvanize the anti-choice movement.”
Suk said that many criticized the decision as representing “archaic, paternalistic ideas” for believing that women cannot deal with the emotional aftermath of their decisions.
Suk also said that there have been discussions of cases in which coerced abortion is compared to rape. If a woman decides to have an unwanted abortion, then the trauma may begin to parallel that of a woman who has had coerced sex, Suk said.
But Shobi Ahmed, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, disagreed with this connection.
“I don’t see that there’s a strong analogy,” Ahmed said.
Some members of the audience said that they found Suk’s speech compelling.
GSAS student Paisid Aramphongphan said he found Suk’s discussion “very interesting, very thought provoking, especially in the way she explores the discourse on both sides.”

Members of Cartooning for Peace, a multinational organization of political cartoonists, discussed yesterday the importance of using their craft to convey political messages, despite limits to free speech in the countries where they work.
Each of the five cartoonists on the panel gave a demonstration of his work and compared the degrees of freedom permitted by the their respective newspapers and countries.
Uri Fink, an Israeli comic book artist and occasional political cartoonist, said that his work has not been censored despite religious, international, and domestic criticism.
But when he eats in Jerusalem restaurants, he sometimes feels threatened due to some Israelis’ disapproval of his cartoons, he said.
Khalil Abu Arafeh, an editorial cartoonist for the Palestinian Al Quds newspaper in Jerusalem, has been imprisoned multiple times for political activism and spoke of Israel’s severe censorship of the Palestinian community.
“I envy Uri [Fink] that he can make fun of his leaders, of settlers, of Jewish religion, everything,” Arafeh said. “That is something I don’t have.”
Le Monde cartoonist Jean Plantureux—better known by his pen name Plantu—said that controversial cartoons could be made less problematic by replacing their subjects with representative symbols.
For instance, a picture of a Muslim man with a pixilated face would be recognized as Muhammad but would not  offend viewers in the same way as a clear rendition of Muhammad.
But cartoonists must be careful to ensure that these symbols are correctly interpreted—which often necessitates the use of cliches understood by an international audience, said Daryl Cagle, owner of the cartoon database Web site Cagle Cartoons and cartoonist for MSNBC.com.
For example, the United States is generally depicted in cartoons as a hamburger.
“When we’re misunderstood, we’re not doing our job,” Cagle said.
The panel also included independent cartoonist Jeff Danziger and was moderated by Boston College Sociology Professor William Gamson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking back on the year in Harvard athletics—my first year as a Crimson fan—I can’t help but think of the highlights: the first home football game against Brown with an Emma Watson sighting, the lacrosse game against Duke when the tailgate was more of a success than the game itself, and the many other matches that I’ve attended, through which my fandom has grown.
One aspect of these memories that I take for granted is that some of them may not have occured if the Athletic Department had not said, “Let there be light.”
Three years ago, the football stadium (and subsequently other fields) was fitted with outdoor lights in order to enable night games. These lights, which followed the addition of FieldTurf and, in the winter, a protective bubble, were first put to use on Sept. 22, 2007 in an Ivy football matchup against Brown. That night, a crowd of nearly 19,000—in addition to the players, coaches, cheerleaders, and band—enjoyed the first night game in the history of America's oldest college.
What would my athletic experience have been like this year without the lights, without the excitement and drama of nocturnal competition? I think Hollywood had it right when they realized that when one brings light, action is certain to follow.

After eluding the Harvard women’s water polo team for three years, victory against Brown finally found its way back into the Crimson’s record books. Amidst high anticipation and excitement from both the crowd and the teams, Harvard (12-10, 1-1 CWPA North) defeated the Bears (18-12, 0-2), 7-6 in double overtime at Blodgett Pool last night.
“I think that it was one of our best games,” freshman center Elise Molnar said. “Everybody was really on and excited to play, and it just came out technically that everything was really perfect.”
From the beginning, both teams entered the pool ready to battle. The decades-long rivalry undoubtedly in the back of their minds, the players’ determination was quite apparent as the shrill whistle from the referees frequently sounded for fouls on each side.
It was a penalty by sophomore attack Shannon Purcell that put the first point on the board, as Brown captain Sarah Glick buried a marker on a foul shot to give the Bears a quick 1-0 edge.
Brown held onto its lead to end the first period up 2-1, but its momentum entering the next eight minutes did little to slow the Crimson, whose defense stepped up after a less-than-perfect performance this past weekend.
“We had some great team defense, and we were able to really neutralize...their strong offensive players,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar explained.
In the second period, the Crimson hit its stride. Despite the strong skill of the Bears’ goalkeeper Stephanie Laing, Harvard scored twice to gain the lead. Crimson sophomore netminder Laurel McCarthy stifled Brown’s offense to allow Harvard a 3-2 lead at halftime.
“We got a great game out of our goalie,” Farrar said. “McCarthy played her best game of the year.”
With such a low score entering the second half of the match, anxieties in Blodgett were running high. The rivalry, which dates back to the 1970s, was in full force as the teams swapped close shots on net.
But the third period saw the Bears pick up momentum and pull ahead as the strong Crimson defense encountered an obstacle—Purcell, its only left-handed starter, fouled out. At the quarter’s end, Brown led, 4-3.
But despite being down, the home team wasn’t fazed.
“That’s what we train for,” Farrar explained.
Molnar expressed the same positive outlook entering the final period down by one.
“I think that once we realized we had lapsed a little, we wanted to come back that much harder,” she said. “It wasn’t a time to think, ‘Oh shoot—they’re coming back.’ It was time to think, ‘Okay, we have to kick it up a notch too.’”
Goals by Molnar and sophomore two-meter defenseman Ita Barton-Kettleborough turned up the heat early in the final quarter—both goals came in less than 30 seconds of play.
“We just kept shooting and hammering away,” Farrar said. “We stuck to our game plan, and that was effective.”
The Bears countered soon after, though, with a strong game plan of their own—the team sank two goals in less than a minute. The fourth period ended with the scored knotted at six, and the game extended into overtime.
In the first eight minutes of extra time, both Harvard and Brown played with few mistakes. As the minutes ticked away and the scoreboard remained the same, the fans became increasingly nervous.
But as Farrar noted, the home-pool advantage definitely made its mark after the Crimson spent over two months on the road.
“The roar of the crowd does huge things,” Farrar said.
Yet to give the fans all of the credit for Harvard’s success in the pool would discredit the teamwork that ultimately gave Harvard the edge in the end.
In the second overtime, with 1:05 left on the clock, sophomore attack Monica Zdrojewski put one between the pipes to lift the Crimson to a 7-6 lead and, ultimately, a long-awaited victory.
“Last week when we prepped, we were so excited for this game,” Molnar noted. “We were so ready to play. The frustration of not being able to play them last week [because a referee did not show up] just channeled through to something really positive.”
The team will now look to channel this victory into additional wins this weekend when it takes on conference opponent Hartwick, followed by a rematch with the Bears.

The pitching was sharp and the bats stayed hot, but once again Harvard could not avoid the Beanpot blues.
Taking on Boston College (16-17, 6-9 ACC) in the first round of the Beanpot tournament at Campanelli Stadium in Brockton, Mass. yesterday afternoon, the Crimson baseball team (11-18, 4-4 Ivy) nearly doubled the Eagles in hits—13 to seven—but fell short where it mattered, winding up on the wrong side of a 10-9 defeat.
“We hit well, guys got on base,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “We needed to score a few more runs earlier in the game, but we showed fight. We were able to battle.”
Harvard posted plenty of offense late in the contest, following a three-run eighth inning with a five-run ninth to nearly tie the game, but the Crimson could not plate the final run as freshman Kyle Larrow struck out swinging with the bases loaded.
Still, just one day after a wild 13-12 victory over Northeastern, Albright was pleased with the team’s resilience.
“I felt like the team was pretty relaxed [in the late innings],” the catcher said. “Everybody just let the pitcher throw and waited for something to hit.”
But the offensive explosion proved too little, too late, as Harvard lamented wasting a strong outing from rookie pitcher Andrew Ferreira. The first-year starter held BC hitless through five innings, keeping the Eagle batters guessing with an accurate fastball and big, lefty curveball.
“[Ferreira’s] first five innings were some of the best five innings I’ve seen in a college baseball uniform,” said Crimson coach Joe Walsh, a 29-year veteran. “He had a Zito-eqsue breaking ball, starting at the armpits and [ending up] down at the knees. BC had five left-handers [in the lineup], and he was neutralizing them, mesmerizing them—whatever verb you want to use.”
Unfortunately for Harvard, it scored just one run of its own in those five innings, when back-to-back two-out singles from Larrow and junior Sean O’Hara plated senior Chris Rouches in the top of the third.
And with Eagles starter Chris Kowalski and reliever Kevin Moran holding their opponents scoreless for the next three innings, it was only a matter of time before the BC offense struck—and it did so forcefully in the bottom of the sixth.
The Eagles’ ninth hitter, Brad Zapenas, opened the frame with the first hit of the day against Ferreira, a single through the left side of the infield. Although a failed pickoff attempt moved Zapenas to second, it seemed that the damage would be limited when BC head coach Mik Aoki opted to play small-ball and sacrifice the runner to third. With a 1-2 count, Ferreira threw consecutive pitches that appeared to cross the plate, according to Walsh. The umpire ruled both balls, and second baseman Matt Hamlet laced the next pitch down the left-field line for a double, just past a drawn-in infield.
“I’m not one to go griping about calls and umpires, but there was no doubt from anyone in our dugout that [Hamlet] should have been punched out,” Walsh said.
Following the controversial calls, two consecutive walks and a hit batsman gave the Eagles the 2-1 lead. An RBI groundout by Mike Sudol and a double by Garret Smith pushed the margin to 5-1 and chased Ferreira.
Zapenas capped the inning with another single through the infield against junior Dan Berardo, putting the Crimson back on its heels.
Still, Harvard would not fold, despite yielding two more runs in the seventh. After a single and a pair of walks loaded the bases in the top of the eighth, sophomore Brent Suter grounded into a fielder’s choice, scoring O’Hara. Junior Sam Franklin then notched a two-out RBI single to right field, which quickly netted a second run on John Spatola’s throwing error.
BC answered right back in the bottom of the frame—plating a pair of runs on a walk and back-to-back doubles—and at 10-4 the game seemed well in hand. But after Aoki opted to let reliever Matt Brazis try to finish the game, the Crimson had other ideas.
Junior Dillon O’Neill walked to open the ninth, but two quick outs seemed to neutralize any threat. Sophomore cleanup hitter Marcus Way promptly belted a double to the center-field wall, though, and singles from sophomore Jeff Reynolds and Albright pulled Harvard within four. After Suter walked to load the bases, Franklin came through again, punching an RBI single to right field. After a Rouches walk forced in Albright, Suter scored on a wild pitch from reliever Dave Laufer, bringing the score to 10-9.
But despite tallying five runs with two outs, the Crimson’s rally came up just short. Larrow fell behind in the count 1-2 and, after fighting off a fastball, swung through an offspeed pitch to end the game. Still, Walsh found it difficult to be disappointed.
“It showed a lot of guts from our team coming back,” Walsh said. “And Ferreira let it all hang out today. To me, it was a pitcher’s duel, and it felt pretty good even though we…gave up 10 runs. It was a strange day—typical Beanpot game.”

For the sixth-straight time in school history, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team soundly defeated Holy Cross, 15-9, last night at Harvard Stadium. The Crimson (5-6, 1-3 Ivy) is undefeated against the Crusaders (4-10, 1-3 Patriot League), and its performance last night was an improvement over last year’s 13-10 victory.
“We are competing consistently,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “These are games that, a couple of years ago, we might have lost, but we are competing, and there’s a lot of progress.”
The Crimson dominated the first half by jumping onto an early lead and never looking back. Harvard built up a 12-2 lead going into halftime, and, despite Holy Cross’ rally in the second half, the Crimson held onto its fifth win of the season.
“We were really excited for this game,” freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “We came out hard, but I think we kind of relaxed in the second half...It was a pretty decent win.”
Co-captain Sara Flood scored three times while dishing out two assists, but the team got most of its scoring from its youth. Freshmen Micaela Cyr and Danielle Tetreault each had two goals in the first half while VanderMeulen led the Harvard offense with five goals in the opening frame. VanderMeulen displayed her full arsenal with a flashy array of strong cuts to the goal, spins, and deadly precision on free position shots. Her goal with one second left in the half capped off a seven-goal run by the Crimson.
“Jen’s just been consistent year-long,” Miller said. “She draws a lot of attention, and I think that frees up a lot of people. She’s one of the best freshmen in the country.”
Harvard’s defense played off the energy of the offense, limiting the Crusaders to only four shots in the half. Sophomore goaltender Kerry Clark, who is also a Crimson news editor, made four key saves to keep Holy Cross from building any momentum.
But the most crucial aspect of the Crimson’s offense was its ability to keep possession of the ball. Harvard dominated the draw controls with a 10-4 edge, allowing the offense to take 22 shots in the first half.
“I think we had the ball the whole time,” Miller said. “We dominated the draw circle and the ground balls, and we defended really hard.”
Unlike the Crimson, which played the half relatively penalty-free, the Crusaders were plagued by a series of fouls, leading to seven free-position shots from Harvard—four of which found their way into the back of the net.
“We took advantages of our opportunities,” VanderMeulen said, “and we didn’t make that many small mistakes.”
VanderMeulen opened the second half with a highlight-reel goal, catching the deflection of her initial shot in midair, and putting the ball over the goaltender and into the back of the net for her sixth and final tally of the contest.
Despite the 13-2 deficit, Holy Cross regrouped and attacked relentlessly, taking advantage of the Crimson’s fatigue to score four unanswered goals.
“It may be...that we just don’t have a whole lot of depth, but we started to get tired,” Miller said of the comeback.
Crusaders junior Annie Boylan rallied her team with a goal in the 18th minute, and Holy Cross came alive with well-planned goal-line executions and great defensive stops.
“We’re still working out some of the kinks of being young,” Miller said. “We got the lead, and we got a little careless with some of the small things. I think sometimes we let down in different time periods.”
But sophomore Melanie Baskind stopped the rally with a midfield interception, followed closely by a goal right in front of the Crusaders’ net.
Holy Cross went on to score three more times before giving up the last goal of the game to freshman Nina Kucharczyk, who scored with three seconds left, to seal the victory for Harvard.
“It was interesting at the end,” Miller said. “You can see the highs and lows of a young team. You see it from game to game, and you see it from half to half. We are getting better, and [we are working on] some of the inconsistencies.”

Harvard soccer alumnus Mike Fucito ’09 got an early birthday present last month, making his MLS debut for the Seattle Sounders only four days before his 24th birthday.
While injuries kept Fucito sidelined for the first year of his professional soccer career, the ex-Crimson superstar made his debut as a Sounder in the team’s season-opening victory on Mar. 25.  Fucito stepped onto the field in the 76th minute of play and helped Seattle secure a 2-0 victory over the Philadelphia Union.
Fucito was selected by the Sounders in the fourth round of the 2008 MLS SuperDraft, marking the end of a highly-successful collegiate soccer career.  As a co-captain of the 2008 Harvard team, Fucito was named a second-team All-American and finished his season leading the Ivy League in total points.  Fucito also ranks fourth on the Crimson’s career scoring list.
A video feature on Fucito’s debut can be found on the Sounder’s website, SoundersFC.com.

The last time the Harvard women’s lacrosse team beat Princeton, the first George Bush was still in the White House. But the two squads went in opposite directions after 1992.
The Tigers soared to the top of the nation, winning back-to-back NCAA titles in 2002 and 2003 before Virginia upset its bid for an undefeated season and a third straight title in the tournament finals.
Meanwhile, the Crimson sunk to the bottom of the league, and the once-fierce rivalry became a guaranteed victory for Princeton, which has won 17 straight over Harvard since ‘92. But after its two titles, the Tigers have started coming back to earth, whereas the Crimson has started to reemerge as a conference threat.
Could this be the year Harvard finally breaks the streak?
Princeton has fallen out of the national rankings, a rarity for the team, and lost, 11-8, to a Cornell team that the Crimson felled, 10-4. Less auspicious for those in Cambridge is the Tigers’ 11-2 victory over a Yale squad that defeated Harvard, 17-13,  and their 16-6 win over a Brown team that knocked off the Crimson by a goal.
Much of the game will be decided by which Princeton defense shows up: the one that allowed 11 goals, or the one that allowed two.
Princeton’s defense is anchored by junior Erin Tochihara, a second team All-American a year ago. Last year, the goalie posted a save percentage of .530 and allowed an average of 8.41 goals per game against the Tigers’ usual mix of conference rivals and national powers.
The junior has been more vulnerable this year with a .473 save percentage and a 10.44 goals against average. Her cumulative statistics were most recently wounded by a 6-13 loss to No. 3 Maryland.
Given that Princeton’s offense has scored in double-figures in all but two contests in a schedule laced with nationally-ranked foes, it seems unlikely that the Tigers’ attackers will be unable to score at least a few goals against the Crimson.
On paper, Princeton is favored to take victory no. 18 and keep the streak going.
Excluding the loss to the Big Red, the Tigers have had better results against stronger opponents. But if the Crimson can frustrate Tochihara as Cornell did, then Harvard may be able to pull off what would be a stunning upset and taste a victory 18 years in the making.

It’s not often that a club sports team gets the chance to play against an international opponent. This Friday, the Harvard Rugby Football Club will get the rare opportunity to host France’s Toulouse Université Club at the Soldiers Field Complex, Cumnock Field #4. The match will start at 4:30pm.
“This is the most interesting match because we played them once before when we went on a tour last year during spring break,” said Match Secretary for the Harvard Rugby Football Club Jonathan Rossi.  We played exhibition matches in Barcelona and Toulouse, and Toulouse was our best competition in France.”
Just as Harvard's club took an international trip last spring break, Toulouse Université is currently on its American tour, and, given the history between these two teams, Cambridge was an obvious destination for the French team.
“The team is fortunately on tour and we were able to host them,” Rossi said. “It should be a great match tomorrow. I’m expecting it to be very close.”
The Harvard rugby team is coming off a substantial 20-12 win over Middlebury College. Earlier in the season, the squad lost against McGill University. The two schools maintain the oldest rugby rivalry in North America.
Harvard's co-captains, juniors Teddy Barron and Jonny Cummins, are no strangers to multinational competition. Barron has represented the Unites States in international tournaments, while Cummins is originally from England.
“International rugby is very different,” Rossi said. “We’re cherishing this chance to play against an international opponent because in America, rugby players don’t grow up with the sport, while in France and Spain, it’s part of their lives.”
While there is a lot of excitement for the matchup, the forecast won’t be as cheerful.
“Forecast is, in fact, rain, but we will be playing regardless. Seating for guests will be available,” Rossi said.

UPDATED: Apr. 15, 2010, 1:49 a.m.
The famed Adams gong, missing since before Housing Day, resurfaced early Wednesday afternoon—in Eliot House dining hall for all to see, no less. This happened the day before the gong's absence was about to be reported to the Cambridge police.
Merely four hours later, two Adams residents entered the Eliot dining hall to retrieve their prized emblem. According to Alana C. Ju '10—an Eliot national—“the pair stood around awkwardly and walked back and forth for a few minutes, then climbed up to take the gong while making obscene gestures at the honorable denizens of Eliot.”
She added that the two then went on to smear strawberry yogurt all over the white announcement boards. Considering the nature of this new act of vandalism—especially after Adams HoCo had threatened to file a police report for theft of the gong—Ju says that her Eliot compatriots momentarily considered reciprocating.
“For a moment,” she said, “we wondered if we should file a police report or something, but then thought—'No. That would be too douchey.'"
Ju said she herself had no role in stealing the gong and that it “was ‘borrowed’ by an unidentified cohort of brave Eliotites with no ties to our HoCo.”

Yardfest is almost here—count down with us! Check out our primer to Kid Cudi, then watch for more Yardfest features to come. Today, we give you a guide to Patrick Park.
He is no hip hop artist. His  lyrics don't scream “I be posted with my blunt and a brew my dude.”  Instead, above the sentimentalized strumming of his  guitar, he murmurs softly, “Maybe life is a song but you're scared to song along, until  the very ending.” Patrick Park, due to infuse our red-brick yard with folk-rock spirit, will be the third act taking the stage in the Tercentenary Theatre this Sunday.
Ever heard of Patrick Park? Cast your mind back to the series finale  of "The O.C." Park's most well-known track, "Life is a Song,” catapulted to fame through its prodigious position in this episode. The song, released on  his second LP “Everyone's in Everyone,” pervaded the O.C. seven years after Park had first leapt to public recognition with his debut album  “Loneliness Knows My Name.”
His newest LP “Come What Will” is your archetypal acoustic-folk album. His genre is not an unfamiliar one—with the familiar acoustic melody and tenderly rough vocals, Park sounds like a synthesis of Damien  Rice and Taylor Swift. His songs are sweet but indistinct. There is nothing  either personalized or individual to his sound.
What has Patrick Park to offer  Yardfest '10? His set may come as a refreshing break from a show that is otherwise dominated by hip hop. His songs are soothing and inherently  easy to sing along to. Many tracks, such as “Something Pretty”  from “Loneliness Knows My Name,” have a subtle folksy  vibe.
Want to know more about Patrick Park? Last week, he chatted with Arts contributing writer Adam T. Horn—read more here.

As dusk fell on Wednesday, 10 remaining humans readied themselves behind their fortification in Kirkland courtyard. The zombies rose from their graves, craving human flesh. The end was near- the final showdown between good and evil, the living and the dead. Would the zombies conquer? Or would any humans escape their bloodthirsty attacks unscathed?
After two weeks of carrying around water guns in their backpacks, throwing socks at zombie blockmates, and for some, even skipping lectures, the approximately 140 Kirkland House residents who began the game as living humans quickly saw their ranks diminish due to the murderous Alpha Zombie and his offspring.
For their final rescue mission, the humans were challenged to hold Kirkland courtyard for 20 minutes without being killed by the zombie swarms. After this time limit, whoever remained must fight their way to the center of the courtyard where “rescue helicopters” would take them to safety. In order to survive, the humans must not be touched with two hands by any of the blood-red headband clad monsters.
The humans were given 15 minutes to build their stronghold, opting to create a barricade of chairs, benches, and hammocks to hold their position on higher ground. They were ready to fight, each armed with a deadly water gun.
The zombies then crept into the courtyard… and they were hungry. All was quiet. Suddenly, a bloodcurdling yell rang throughout the battlefield, and the ravenous masses charged toward the humans’ fortification. The epic showdown had finally begun.
The humans valiantly fended off the vicious hordes, using their guns to stun the monsters. Wave after wave of zombies rushed toward their stronghold, and with each charge, broke down part of their defenses.
However, after 20 minutes had passed, six humans were quickly murdered. The four remaining humans formed a small circle facing outward, and, armed with their water guns, moved slowly toward the center of the courtyard. The vicious zombies waited patiently, allowing them to come closer… closer… closer. Then they struck.
The merciless beasts charged the humans, who broke apart attempting to maneuver their way to the center without being killed, carrying the survival of humanity on their shoulders. All was confusion. Suddenly, two triumphant yells were heard from the center of the masses.
The game was over.
Jade R. Randle ’11 and Alan A. Ibrahim ’11 had reached the helicopter and emerged victorious, the lone survivors from the showdown, preserving hope for humans to come.
After a round of the Kirkland Ode, known by zombies and humans alike, the zombies skulked back to their graves.
“These were two of the most paranoid weeks of my life,” said Randle, but both survivors said it was worth it, for they were able to defeat the zombies in the end.
“The humans are resilient,” admitted zombie Alex C. Chang ’10. “I have to give props to them.”
“I’m absolutely dumb founded [with how it turned out,]” said the game’s overseer Michael J. Chance ’10. “I think it turned out better then I ever could have hoped, and I think that’s due to the fact that Kirkland is the kind of house where this stuff shines.”
At the end of the day, it was all worth it. The humans lived to see another day.

Apple fans rejoice – you no longer need to go to the Apple store in Boston to play with an iPad, the new feminine hygiene product mobile gadget that has been all over the news. All it takes is a trip to the Computer Product and Repair Center in the Science Center basement, and three display iPads are yours for the fiddling.
“It’s been constantly busy,” said Adam W. Parker, a product specialist for Technology Services, referring to the iPads that have been on display since Technology Services received its shipment.
While many people just go to play with the device for the first time, many have bought the device too, according to Parker. He said that Technology Services ran out of their initial supply of just under 100 iPads in only a few days.
Technology Services has been actively promoting the new gadget, sending e-mails over their lists on Monday and even displaying a human-sized iPad sign to announce the device’s arrival.
You can purchase the device from Technology Services in the basement of the Science Center, at their center in Allston on 219 Western Ave., or by telephone at 617-495-5450. Online purchases are not possible for the time being.
“Hopefully we’ll get more soon,” Parker said. “I definitely want one too.”

With the return of "Glee" this week, you may find yourself wishing that you, too, could spontaneously break out into song or dance. Well, this afternoon, some Harvard students did just that.
Around 1:00 this afternoon, the yard appeared to be in its usual state. Students sat in the yard-chairs doing homework, tourists crowded around John Harvard, and visitors strolled through, enjoying the beautiful spring weather.
Just a few minutes later, amidst confused tourists and unsuspecting students, a round of flash-dance musical chairs broke out. For 15 minutes, music blared and participants danced and fought each other for a seat in one of the pastel-colored yard chairs in front of Grays.
As Lady Gaga's voice flooded the yard, participants fought to avoid elimination during each round.  Between rounds, those eliminated read Emily Dickinson poems over a speaker system while those still in the game prepared themselves for the next round.
In the end, Katerina Solovyova, a visiting pre-frosh, defeated her last opponent to clinch the victory. "I didn't know what was going on, but I was passing by, so I just joined in," said Solovyova. With a smile she added, "I'm pretty sure I'm coming here next year."
The event was one of many, as part of a theatrical initiative by Harvard's American Repertory Theater. A.R.T. Artistic Fellow Allegra E. Libonati said that A.R.T. Artistic Director Diane M. Paulus '87 wants to encourage these types of artistic expression.
Tourists, students, pre-frosh, passersby, and faculty alike are encouraged to participate in these flash-mob events. "The idea is that it's spontaneous, and that it's a composite of students, tourists, and people who just happen to be there," said A.R.T. Marketing Associate Jared Fine, one of the "co-instigators" of the event.
So if you're worried that you missed out on your chance to turn your life into a scene from "Mamma Mia," fear not. Just contact the A.R.T. to find out when the next bout of spontaneity will happen, and in the meantime, try to match this kid's dancing skills. We at FlyBy will be impressed if you come close....
