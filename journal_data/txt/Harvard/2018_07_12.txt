After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BANGALORE, India—I didn’t type “the end” when I finished. It sounds silly, but it feels like a jinx to me—like if I declare my draft finished, it’ll come to life in the middle of the night and cackle in my dreams. “You don’t get to decide when I’m done. It’s over when I say it is!”
Or something like that. I don’t know; I’m tired.
I spent most of June working on the first draft of a novel. I’ve never quite managed the skill it takes to distill an idea into short fiction. So a full-length story is wonderful to work on now that I have the time, like a run in the springtime after a cold winter of hibernation. But there’s always an after that hits like summer heat, far too early.
It turns out that writing is easy. Editing is a nightmare. Most of my writing for The Crimson is simple that way. I can churn out a piece and hand it off to someone else, and it’s their job to correct my sentence structure, curb my runaway ideas, and cut out my extra commas. But now I’m doing that job myself, on something a hundred times longer than any piece of journalism I’ve written. As a matter of fact, going through manuscript pages and scribbling out suggestions is the only manageable thing about revision.
Every change I consider comes with a surge of self-doubt, a voice in my head that I can’t shut off. Who would want to read this, let alone buy it? There’s so much to fix. This is a mess. How will I ever untangle plot threads and add colour to characters until it’s even remotely salvageable? The answer, on more days than not, feels like this: I can’t. On those days I can’t even eke out a word on other  easier, shorter projects. I miss the structure of drafting, the comfort of thinking, “Just get that far and then you can start to worry.” I walk around so consumed by worry that I can’t even find joy in reading, because that nasty voice in my head says, “Don’t you wish you could write something like this? Because you can’t.”
It all sounds terribly dramatic. But the ocean of work any artist faces in order to turn a promise into a presentable piece feels insurmountable. More than anything, I wish someone from the future could tell me it all works out in the end when I look at this brick wall head on. But I suspect even a hypothetical best-selling, accomplished me wouldn’t be able to turn this feeling off.
All I can do is remind myself—rifling through pages and grimacing at my own notes—that this isn’t the end of the story. It’s over when I say it is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Drew G. Faust will add to her growing list of board memberships this fall when she will join the board of trustees of the J. Paul Getty Trust, the organization announced in a press release Tuesday.
The Getty Trust is the world’s largest cultural and philanthropic organization dedicated to the visual arts and is based in Los Angeles, Calif., according to the group’s website.
Getty Board of Trustees Chair Maria Hummer-Tuttle said in the press release that she was “pleased” that Faust is joining the board.
“Her academic leadership is inspiring and the board welcomes her wisdom and expertise,” Hummer-Tuttle said.
James Cuno, the president of the Getty Trust, said that Faust brings “extensive experience” to the board.
“Her contributions to the humanities are of the greatest distinction and I look forward to working with her to further the Getty’s mission in the service of the world’s cultural heritage,” Cuno said.
Faust, who ended her 11 year presidential tenure at Harvard less than two weeks ago, will become an official member of the board in September.
She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This is not Faust’s first membership to an academic organization’s board. Faust also serves on the educational advisory board of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation and has served as a board member of several other academic organizations.
Since departing from her office in Massachusetts Hall, Faust also joined the board of Goldman Sachs last week.
Her addition to the Goldman Sachs’ board is her second corporate board membership. Faust has been a part of Staples Inc.’s board of directors since April 2012.
Faust will also continue to teach as a history professor at Harvard.
