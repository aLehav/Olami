After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
GRAND MARAIS, Minn. — A Cantabridgian sensibility counsels against striking up conversation with random people on the T, much less following them into the woods. Scruffy men with leather-sheathed daggers? Keep more than a social distance.
But on the Superior Hiking Trail — a 300-mile footpath from Canada to the farthest inland port of the Saint Lawrence Seaway — strangers like Ron are my best pals.
I’m headed into a fishing town to pick up food for the next leg of my two-week journey south. (I need bug spray, too; I ran out after two nights of apocalyptic mosquitoes.) The local-looking fellow at the trailhead advises Grand Marais is a couple of miles away by road. But he knows a shortcut and invites me toward the bushes. I oblige and abandon my map.
We trek down a ski path, apparently overrun with shoulder-high grass until Ron mowed it this morning. After a career in construction, he spends his free time tending to this hometown trail network. I feel exhausted after today’s 16-mile march, but the 72-year-old is unimpressed; he says he walked at least that far this morning in his baggy blue jeans.
Wild raspberries — ubiquitous since the start of my solo journey — line the hike. These scarlet delights are wider, thinner, and more tender than the ones you buy at Whole Foods, with a taste akin to prune-flavored Sweet Tarts. We pause for a snack.
“Not raspberries,” Ron chides, nibbling a piece of grass. “Thimbleberries.”
I add another entry to my mental list of edible species. Other passers-by have pointed out blueberries, gooseberries, and serviceberries. One forager recommended I pick reddish-orange lobster mushrooms and sautée them in butter, like the seafood namesake. Though fungus-wary, I’ll give it a try.
The trail turns into forest, and after a few minutes of bushwhacking, we’re standing on the gridiron behind Ron’s alma mater: Cook County High School. The Vikings were state football champions in 1997, 1998, and 1999, he brags, but they’ve never been the same since that illustrious coach left town.
At the road that runs toward the harbor, Ron gives directions to a favorite restaurant and assures that my filthy condition won’t faze its owners. He says goodbye and turns back uphill; I think he wandered pretty far out of his way to guide me.
It might sound lonely to backpack in solitude for eight hours a day, cell service mostly nonexistent. But trail life catalyzes a near-immediate sense of intimacy with fellow adventurers. Personal connection comes naturally while filling water from a leech-infested pond or savoring a pot of rehydrated beef stroganoff.
Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, writes of a “lonely freedom” enchanting those who wander into the wilderness. Mountains and waterfalls are magnificent, but for me, the outdoors is most appealing in its disinhibition. It’s less about escaping the bustle of civilization than savoring moments of uncommon social authenticity.
They’re rarely the subject of my storytelling, but spontaneous encounters with people like Lucy, Celeste, Elli, Leah, Crystal, Harriet, Ron, Gracie, Dan, Ben, Athena, Molly, and Kathryn — along with dozens of others whom I remember vividly but can’t name — bring the SHT to life. They are campfire companions, wildlife interpreters, hitchhike enablers, and ambassadors of North Shore hospitality.
When in the backcountry, trust strangers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To our readers:
We last wrote to you on the status of our print production in mid-March, days after Harvard sent undergraduates home due to growing numbers of coronavirus cases nationwide. At the time, we decided to suspend our print paper with the hope that Harvard students — including The Crimson’s staff — would safely return to Cambridge for the fall semester.
That did not happen. Case counts continue to rise, and the majority of our undergraduate readers — including most of our staff — did not return to campus this fall.
For that reason, we have decided to continue online-only production for the time being. We miss working through the early hours each weekday morning to publish a print paper, but recognize that without a building full of Crimson staff to put it together and a bustling campus to read it, we better serve our readers by delivering the news online.
Still, the past six months have brought more welcome changes. We continued to cover Harvard, breaking news and holding administrators to account from afar. We took photographs and created designs to illustrate this historic moment. We examined our own shortcomings with regard to diversity and began working to improve them. In the coming months, we will welcome a new class of editors to The Crimson, just as we do every semester.
In 1933, during another time of considerable uncertainty, former Crimson president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Class of 1904, told the paper’s editors to “keep the old sheet flying.” They did then, and we will now.
Sincerely,
Aidan F. Ryan ’21

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first came to Harvard, the last thing I expected was to tell a professor something they didn’t know.
Before college, I had never met anyone who had attended an elite university. I didn’t think being low-income was particularly important — after all, nearly everyone I knew growing up was low-income, too. I just wanted the education and opportunities not available in my rural, working-class hometown. I had no way to anticipate the culture I was about to encounter, where most interactions appeared to revolve around how many of your high school classmates also attended Harvard or what country you visited over spring break. Being the only one from my high school to ever be accepted to an Ivy League institution, I sometimes felt I no longer understood the context of what people around me were saying.
But while this was alienating coming from my peers, I could understand it — they didn’t have any reason to know about experiences other than their own. What surprised me, however, was that professors, teaching fellows, and advisors often assumed I was wealthy and became dismissive or disbelieving when I tried to tell them that I came from an underserved public school system. If you’re at Harvard, the logic went, you didn’t really attend an underserved school. Since I couldn’t show them my school’s textbooks literally falling apart or my lifetime of being discouraged from pursuing my education, I didn’t know how to respond. I eventually had to conclude that many professors and TFs simply don’t know how to interact with low-income students. Given how difficult it seems to be for some to understand, I’m not sure why it is our job, as low-income students, to teach them.
For a culture that places a high value on students connecting with professors through concepts like networking and mentorship — so much so that we are even given chances to invite professors out to dinner — Harvard culture offers few incentives for professors to try to relate to students who aren’t from the same background as they are. I wish the teaching staff would take a moment to remember that just because a student doesn’t immediately introduce themselves as low-income doesn’t mean they’re not. I wish they would realize that it’s hard to describe yourself with terms like “first-gen” when you have never heard this term before, much less heard it defined. It’s true that Harvard culture does not typically define words; but since every professor has a much higher level of education than anyone in my hometown, understanding that not everyone knows the definition of coded language should be easier for them than it is for me.
These assumptions don’t have to continue. Resources already exist that could help professors understand students’ backgrounds — such as the book “The Privileged Poor,” in which Anthony A. Jack (another Harvard professor) describes the experiences of the “Doubly Disadvantaged,” students like me who are low-income and went to under-resourced public schools. But this knowledge is only useful if they access it.
Correcting assumptions shouldn’t be our job either: Students shouldn’t have to teach their professors. Low-income students are not trained diversity educators. On the contrary, they’re the least likely to have the cultural capital necessary to communicate effectively with professors in the first place. Our job is to study and learn, not to reveal personal information to accommodate someone more educated and experienced than we are.
Instead of putting the burden on disadvantaged students to describe the obstacles they have had to overcome to get to Harvard, professors and TFs should educate themselves on inequities in the U.S. education system and on the changing demographics of Harvard students due to the financial aid program. They should ask students what their previous education was like rather than acting as though this subject is taboo or irrelevant at a college where students prominently feature their elite prep schools in their email signatures.
Using this knowledge, professors and TFs can take the initiative to help students understand their proficiency level in subjects they might never have formally studied, define academia-specific references such as office hours, and take low-income/first-gen students’ complaints seriously. In this time of remote classes in particular, they can question slogans like “Harvard Everywhere,” which rest on the false premise that “Everywhere” equals Cambridge or Manhattan in terms of access to opportunities and a culture supportive of academic achievement, and push back on colleagues who promote these ideas.
I have met professors and TFs who genuinely do not make assumptions about their students. They take the time to learn about their students’ backgrounds and don’t place the burden on them to correct them if they assume wrong. But if the rest won’t try to understand, perhaps Harvard should step up its training to ensure that all the teaching staff has basic knowledge of where students come from, especially the different levels of education and cultural knowledge they bring with them. After all, educating others isn’t supposed to be a student’s job — it’s the professors who should do the teaching.

A new coating technology developed by researchers at the Wyss Institute — an engineering research center at Harvard — and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences could soon be used to develop air purification devices that filter viruses like COVID-19.
Metalmark Innovations, a Boston-based startup, licensed the technology with the ultimate goal of using it to remove pollutants and viruses from indoor air.
The technology originated from studies conducted by Harvard researchers into the colors of butterfly wings. Joanna Aizenberg, professor of Materials Science and Chemistry & Chemical Biology, who led the team that developed the technology, said the honeycomb-like structure of butterfly wings first drew her team’s attention.
“Our original emphasis was how one can design a range of interesting optical devices,” Aizenberg said. “But as we went along this line, we realized that — we have original technology of this self-assembly into these butterfly wing-like structures — we can add to that yet another element.”
Aizenberg said her team added catalytic nanoparticles — substances used to initiate chemical processes — to a coating based on the butterfly’s unique wing-like structure, taking advantage of its large surface area to maximize the particles’ exposure to polluted air.
Metalmark chief executive officer Sissi X. Liu said the technology could be used in toxin-reducing devices known as catalytic converters, as well as indoor air purification systems. Liu said the fact that the technology only requires “off-the-shelf materials” could make the purification devices much cheaper than existing products on the market.
Aizenberg also noted the technology's ability to break down viruses and pollutants through chemical processes.
“Viruses or anything else are composed of small organic molecules,” Aizenberg said. “So one of the topics that currently became important is what if, in our offices and our houses, there would be a coating that reduces the ability of these molecules to self-assemble into viruses?”
Liu said the removal of coronavirus from indoor air is one direction that Metalmark plans to take the technology. She added that Metalmark plans also to use it to conduct chemical transformations that turn harmful air toxins into safer materials.
“The composition of our indoor air is mostly similar to the atmosphere typically with higher concentrations of CO2, and then you have volatile organic compounds and other ultra-fine particulate aerosols,” Liu said. “It’s really bad for us. So transforming those low concentrations of air toxins into CO2 is going to be a lot more benign and beneficial for health.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and Global Health Professor Ashish K. Jha has left Longwood to serve as the Dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University.
Jha began as an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health in 2004. He has also worked as a practicing general internist at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System.
Jha was approached by former University President Drew G. Faust to head the Harvard Global Health Institute, where he began as director in 2014. The institute brought together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and affiliated faculty members from across Harvard’s schools, including the Law School, Business School, Medical School, and School of Public Health.
Jha said in an interview that during his conversations with Faust, he picked up a “very clear signal” that she wanted to lead a University “deeply engaged” with the world around it.
“She wanted a Harvard that felt relevant to people who would never set foot in Cambridge, and that to me was very compelling,” Jha said.
The institute's efforts have partly focused on researching pandemics and building a framework for pandemic response, which Jha said has given members of the Global Health Institute a robust foundation to contribute to key research during the coronavirus pandemic.
“That was really important work that allowed us then in March — when this pandemic really started getting bad — to respond very quickly,” Jha said. “I think over the last five, six months, the Harvard Global Health Institute has really been on the forefront of responding to the pandemic, generating data.”
Since March, the team has teamed up with major news organizations like ProPublica and the New York Times to calculate key figures about hospital bed capacity across the country and publish guidelines on the number of tests needed per day to reopen the economy during the pandemic.
The Global Health Institute has also worked to raise awareness of climate change as a public health issue. Stefanie C. Friedhoff — the institute’s director of content and strategy — said Jha has played a key role in addressing that issue, including through testimony before Congress.
“Ashish, early on, knew that climate change is a huge health problem and that the parts of Harvard that work on the environment and the parts of Harvard that work on health needed to come together and build a big tent to start addressing this challenge together,” Friedhoff said.
Jha said the wide range of topics that the institute’s scientists and policy researchers tackle has provided him broad intellectual engagement and will prepare him well to enter his new role as a public health school dean.
“At the Global Health Institute, I might start in the morning talking about climate change, in the afternoon might give an introduction on why we need to be thinking about AI and how it affects global health, and in the evening, be leading a discussion on U.S. government policy,” Jha said.
“Part of being a dean is really learning and getting deeply, intellectually engaged in topics that you don't have the expertise in,” he added.
Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams wrote in an emailed statement that Jha has been a “valued colleague and prolific researcher.”
“He has been a leading voice in providing evidence-based information to the public and policymakers as the country and the world deal with the COVID-19 pandemic,” Williams wrote. “We wish Ashish the best in his new, well-deserved role as dean of the Brown School of Public Health.”

Middlesex County District Attorney Marian T. Ryan and Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. identified the victim of a fatal traffic accident in Harvard Square last month as 55-year-old Darryl Willis. The District Attorney’s Office has yet to file charges against the driver of the tractor-trailer that collided with Willis as he rode a bicycle, per a press release.
Willis’s death on Aug. 18 marked at least the third fatal accident involving a cyclist in Cambridge since October 2015, when the city released its Bicycle Plan, which aimed to make all streets “bicycle friendly.”
The tractor-trailer was traveling westbound on Massachusetts Avenue, away from Harvard Square, when Willis was killed, per the press release. Following Willis’s death, Cambridge residents took to social media calling on the city to institute safety measures to protect cyclists in the often congested area.
Cambridge City Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote on Twitter that the city should “rethink” Harvard Square traffic in the wake of the accident.
“Anyone who has been in Harvard Square can tell you it’s almost always full of pedestrians and cyclists crossing irregular intersections that were designed before motor vehicles existed. We need to rethink and pedestrianize these streets to make sure this does not keep happening," Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote.
Last week, Cambridge announced it would fast-track a number of long-planned reforms in the wake of Willis’s death, including adding a separated bike lane to Mass. Ave. and reducing the number of traffic lanes between Harvard Yard and the kiosk that formerly housed Out of Town News.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick declined to comment on the investigation into Willis’s death, referring to the District Attorney’s Office.
Marcela Dwork, a press representative for the District Attorney’s Office, confirmed the office “is still investigating the facts and circumstances of the incident.” Dwork added that the office will provide further information as it becomes available.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Overcoming an initial polling deficit and the weight of Massachusetts’s most famous political dynasty, incumbent United States Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) took down primary challenger U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) Tuesday after a campaign that captured the energy of the state’s energized and youthful progressives.
Kennedy, who has represented the state’s Fourth Congressional District since 2013, called Markey to concede the race just after 10 p.m., making him the first member of his storied family to lose a race in Massachusetts. Markey led Kennedy, 55 percent to 44 percent, early Wednesday morning.
“Tonight is more than just a celebration of a movement,” Markey said before a crowd of reporters and a handful of surrogates, albeit one that lacked the energy typical of pre-pandemic victory parties. “It is a reaffirmation of the need to have a movement — a progressive movement of young people demanding radical change, demanding justice; a movement giving voice and power to young people when for far too long they were ignored.”
“This victory is a tribute to those young people and their vision,” Markey added. “They will save us if we trust them.”
Kennedy, 39 — whose father, former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, and great-uncles, former U.S. Senator Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54-’56 and former President John F. Kennedy ’40, represented Massachusetts in Washington as part of a once-untouchable political dynasty — sharpened his attacks against Markey and leaned into his family legacy late in the election. But the persistent question of why he entered the race in the first place loomed over his candidacy as he struggled, according to critics, to articulate a reason for seeking to unseat Markey.
“The senator is a good man,” Kennedy said outside his Watertown, Mass., campaign headquarters just after 10:30 p.m. “You have never heard me say otherwise. It was difficult at times between us. Good elections often get heated, but I am grateful for the debates, for his commitment and for his commitment to our Commonwealth, and for the energy and enthusiasm that he brought to this race.”
“We built a campaign for the people that our politics too often locks out and leaves behind,” he said.
Markey, 74, made his policy work on environmental issues a focal point of the campaign, focusing on his co-sponsorship of the Green New Deal along with U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who endorsed him. She declared in a television ad she cut for his campaign, “When it comes to progressive leadership, it’s not your age that counts. It’s the age of your ideas.”
In his victory speech, delivered in his hometown of Malden, Mass. around 11 p.m. Tuesday, Markey described climate change as “the one issue” that “defines our future.”
“Every other problem is linked to it,” he said. “No solution to any challenge will be successful unless we address it.”
The state’s progressive voters rallied behind the message. Markey earned the endorsement of the Sunrise Movement, MoveOn, Our Revolution, and a plethora of Twitter accounts, dubbed the #Markeyverse, that flooded the digital sphere and defended him online at a time when the internet played an outsized role in campaigning due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“This is much more Ed Markey’s success than Joe Kennedy’s failure,” said longtime Massachusetts political consultant Michael Goldman.
Goldman credited Markey — and his campaign manager, John E. Walsh — for securing endorsements from many key players in the state — including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who taught Kennedy at Harvard Law School, and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh.
“His ability to muster that online mobilization without having had it in the past is absolutely incredible,” said Michael B. Baick ’22, a Longmeadow, Mass., resident who backed Markey.
“This marks the perfection of the model of online activism that Senator Warren and Senator [Bernie] Sanders kicked off,” Baick said. “Especially because it was a local race so managed by people at the grassroots.”
In the months following Kennedy’s announcement of his candidacy, he was thought to be firmly in the lead, as Markey’s favorability lagged and he trailed significantly in head-to-head polling.
“In Massachusetts, I think that Ed Markey was this unsung hero, but not one who sort of captured popular attention,” Baick said. “I mean, he’s a Massachusetts senator who was never a presidential contender — that in itself sort of seems like anonymity, relatively speaking.”
But Markey — who has served in Washington since the 1970s and in the Senate since 2013 — more than made up the ground he needed throughout the summer with a continued focus on policy issues in debates, even as Kennedy worked to poke holes in his record.
“The fact that he was able to convince people that he had been doing this work throughout his whole career is incredible,” Baick said. “It’s so difficult for a legislator to communicate the work that they have done — it’s usually about promising what you will.”
Markey will face Republican contender Kevin O’Connor, a Dover, Mass. lawyer backed by Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, who defeated his opponent Shiva Ayyadurai in the GOP primary Tuesday.
Markey’s victory was joined by down-ballot successes for other incumbents in Tuesday’s primaries. Democratic U.S. Representatives Richard E. Neal, Seth W. Moulton ’01, and Stephen F. Lynch all won handily in their respective races.
In the crowded race to replace Kennedy in the Fourth Congressional District, Jesse Mermell led Jacob D. Auchincloss ’10 by a hair as of early Wednesday morning, with 80 percent of precincts reporting.

Meet the Class of
2024
Each August, The Crimson surveys incoming freshmen about their backgrounds, academic aspirations, and lifestyles. For the first time, incoming students also answered questions about their experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Below is the third installment of this year’s results, which covers the beliefs and lifestyle of the Class of 2024.  
Roughly 76 percent of the class responded to the survey. The Crimson did not adjust the data for any possible self-selection bias. Part I of the survey ran on Sept. 1, Part II on Sept. 2., and Part III on Sept. 3. Part IV will run on Sept. 6.  
The results of last year's survey of the Class of 2023 can be found here.

Let’s admit it — going virtual last spring was tough. Without having to leave your bed for class, walk downstairs to the dining hall for a meal, or clean your suite up to keep your blockmates happy, it’s possible that you slipped up a little bit on your daily routine. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. If you’re nervous about picking things back up for the fall, check out these tips for how to turn over a new leaf and be productive again this semester!
The KonMari Method
As the great author, organizing consultant, and television personality Marie Kondo says: “discard everything that does not spark joy.” This isn’t to say you should throw out your p-sets. However, getting organized does involve removing clutter from our lives. If you’ve got items that don’t mean much to you, but stress you out by contributing to the clutter in your room, consider tossing them out. Organizing your space can help you organize your thoughts!
Find Pset Buddies
Imagine yourself facing a choice between staying on your phone all night or starting the homework that’s due on Friday. If you’re anything like us, you’d probably pick the first option if you were planning to do that homework alone. This is where trusty pset buddies come in! A pset buddy helps keep you accountable and get you unstuck when you’ve hit a rut in your work. Find a few people that you work well with in each class, check in or Zoom with each other as you do the assignment, and watch your doing-homework-during-homework-time to watching-TikToks-during-homework-time ratio skyrocket.
Take a Break From Your Screen
Looking at your weekly screen time report may be a terrifying experience, but it really can be helpful to know how much time you’re spending in front of a laptop or phone — especially if the screen time is straining your eyes or your ability to focus. If you’ve been spending too much time with your electronics, give yourself a break to recharge. Do a screen detox by reading a physical book, taking a walk outside, or doing your math homework on paper if possible. Your mind and body will thank you!
Set Your Goals
It’s easier to be productive if you know what you’re trying to accomplish. Instead of setting out to be productive in general, create a weekly or daily list of tasks you are trying to complete. At the end of the week or day, reevaluate your list and how successful you were in meeting your goals. Maybe you got everything done, or maybe you need to cut back a little bit for next time. Either way, the best part about setting goals is that you can reward yourself when they are complete.
Hopefully, some of these tips have inspired you enough to get back to work. It’s a new semester and we are so excited about this new, productive version of quarantine you. Remember, half the challenge is getting started, and if you’re reading this right now, you’re already there. Good luck and happy first week of classes!

While psets and long Zoom lectures are in our futures, HUDS brunches unfortunately aren't — for those of us not on campus, at least. We decided to bring our favorites to you at home in Part Two of our Recreate HUDS Dishes series.
Broccoli Cheddar Chicken Breasts
These golden pieces of perfection are a brunch classic, perfect when the Veritaffle line is too long. If you’re looking to recreate your Sunday meals, check out the recipe below.
Ingredients
3 chicken breasts
1 cup broccoli florets
3 tbsp cream cheese, softened
½ cup shredded cheddar cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Olive oil
Optional
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 cup flour
3 eggs, beaten
1 cup bread crumbs
To make the broccoli-cheddar stuffing: steam the broccoli, then chop finely. To a small bowl, add cream cheese, broccoli, cheddar cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, and mix. Salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
To prepare the chicken, season both sides with salt and pepper. Slice lengthwise, but not all the way through, cutting a “pocket” for the filling. Fill each breast with the broccoli mixture.
Heat a skillet on medium-high heat and add a little olive oil. Sear both sides of the chicken until fully cooked through. You can also bake the chicken for a slightly healthier alternative.
If you are feeling extra, before cooking, set up three separate bowls of flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs. Season the flour with salt and extra garlic and onion powder. Dip each filled chicken breast in the flour, then eggs, then coat with breadcrumbs for an addictive crunch. Cook as directed above.
Field Greens Cranberry Walnut Salad
You know that fancy salad HUDS has in place of the basic lettuce, but only on Sundays? Well, Flyby did some investigating and it turns out it’s really easy to make — walnuts, cranberries, and all! Here is the recipe:
Ingredients
3 cups field greens salad mix
1 medium red onion
1 cup dried cranberries
¾ cup crumbled feta cheese
½ cup toasted walnut pieces (can substitute pecans)
2 tbsps balsamic vinegar
2 tbsps olive oil
1 tbsp honey mustard
1 tbsp cranberry sauce
Optional
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp sugar
Salt and pepper to taste
To make the salad: in a large mixing bowl, combine the field greens, cranberries, feta, and walnut pieces. Thinly slice the red onion and add to the bowl; if the onion is too big or you just don’t love onions, you can leave some out.
To prepare the dressing: in a small mixing bowl, add the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and honey mustard. Beat until completely mixed and the oil and vinegar are not visibly separate. Stir in the cranberry sauce, garlic powder, and sugar (if more sweetness is desired) and beat again until smooth.
Pour dressing over the salad and gently toss with tongs. This will prevent small pieces from settling to the bottom and keep the salad evenly mixed!
This late in quarantine, we’re all hoping for a future with HUDS for every meal (partly because of our undying love for HUDS, but more importantly because the dining halls are a quintessential part of being campus). Flyby can’t bring you to Harvard, so we hope you appreciate us bringing HUDS to you instead. Chef’s kiss and enjoy!
