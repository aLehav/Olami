After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the orchestra begins to play at the front of the stage, Janiah C. Lockett ’20 walks on to the stage to deliver her solo as Colonel Fairfax, a statuesque replica of the Tower of London standing behind her. This is the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ production of William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan’s, “The Yeoman of the Guard: or The Merryman and his Maid.” It’s a comedic opera set in the 16th century that follows Phoebe Meryll, a young woman, who is in love with Fairfax, a colonel unjustly sentenced to death. She and her father, Sergeant Meryll, decide to save Fairfax’s life by disguising him as her brother, Leonard. Their elaborate ruse slowly falls apart with the introduction a pair of entertainers, Elsie Maynard and Jackie Pointe. It will be running from Mar. 24 to Apr. 1 in Agassiz Theater.
Producer Isabella M. Kopits ’20 believes that despite the traditional elements of the play, like the costumes and the tower, this production brings fresh elements to the original story. “We wanted to stay true to the original story, but I know the director [Nermin Hasanovic ’20] is keen on having modern characters," Kopits says. “For example we crossed cast several of our roles and tried to give women, especially on stage, more agency.”
Lockett, who plays the traditionally male role Fairfax, agrees. “It [also] connected me to a long tradition of operatic and Shakespearean acting where a lot of the times the actors are playing an opposite gender.” In some ways, Lockett views the setting as an essential part of making elements like the female-heavy cast stand out. “The traditional set allows the bold moves with casting to shine through,” she says.
The show’s design and lighting are particularly special due to their elaborateness according to technical producer Michaela J. Kane ’18. “[For the Tower,] we created a compound with a mix of glue, paint, and rolatex to create three-dimensional flagstones,” she says. The lighting is also very stylized to create different moods for each character. “The cyc, the blue tarp that surrounds the production, takes colour really well….We have given each character a colour palette. Fairfax is purple. Elsie is pink. This both heightens the mood and creates patterns which can then be broken. As Elsie is devastated, [for example], the sky becomes a corruption of her pink,” Kane says.
With its unusual but exciting casting, Kane and her colleagues hope “Yeomen of the Guard” will delight.

Marjorie Lacombe ’13 started her now-famous Instagram in her pre-med days. She is the creative mastermind behind the account @creativekipi, which has over 100,000 followers. Her feed is filled with photographs of cotton-candy skies and San Francisco facades, all in the same dreamy pastel hues.
“While I was working at the Boston Medical Center, one of my coworkers was starting the challenge of 100 days of happiness, where you take a picture every day and you share it on Instagram. My friends were telling me, ‘Oh, you’re so artistic, you should be on it!’ and I just thought oh, whatever. It’s another social platform. How great could it be?” Lacombe laughed. “But I did it anyway, because I was looking for that artistic outlook. And by day five, I was totally invested.”
Around this time, Lacombe was also experiencing a professional shift. She originally thought that she was going to pursue a career in pediatrics, but a few weeks before what would have been her first day of medical school, a different, artistic career called her instead. “I think at that point it had really culminated, and the decision was really clear,” Lacombe said. “I [would have] had to give up on a lot of the creative work and projects I had built up until that point in order to pursue medicine. And it was just a question of what was more core to my identity.”
“Medicine was always the more logical, rational option,” she said. “And [creativity] was the more natural passion.” Now, Lacombe is an art director for Sephora in San Francisco. She has previously worked for Prada, Dior, and Buzzfeed. Despite her pre-med background, Lacombe says she has always been invested in the arts. Before college, she sewed and sold pencil cases for fun and would borrow her photographer father’s camera for her own projects.
“I would carry the video camera around and take videos of my friends and pretend to make documentaries all the time, even though we did nothing really significant,” she said.
While at Harvard, she sang in the a capella group KeyChange and made a documentary about food waste for a sociology course, the process of which fascinated her. “How do you represent something that is important, or that has meaning? How do you convey it to somebody in a way that they’ll be interested?” she said. “I think that really helped me hone in on the art field—in particular the visual arts.”
During her junior year, Lacombe found something that combined both her creativity and her entrepreneurial spirit when she realized she had too many clothes in her closet.
“Dorms are tiny, so it was unbearable. And I was supposed to study abroad in the following semester, so I needed to get rid of [them],” she says. “There was probably a simple solution to that, but being a very creative person I got carried away very easily.”
What started out as an issue of convenience turned into a two-year business. She soon realized that she could sell her clothes online. “That just quickly snowballed into ‘Well if I’m selling online, I need my own website, and if I need my own website, I have to design it, and I have to take the photographs, and I have to figure out a payment process, and I have to advertise.’ It just spiraled.” She started an online retail consignment shop called “I Like Fall,” hired interns, and won the Harvard Individual Green Carpet Award.
“I guess looking back, I was the creative director of that,” she said. The next year, Lacombe started “The Kipi Blog” as both a welcome alternative to schoolwork and as a mode of creative expression. She wrote about travel, DIY, and photography “under a pastel framework”—themes similar to what @creativekipi is now. They even share the same namesake, and for good reason: “Kipi” was a nickname Lacombe’s father gave her when she was a child.
“The name ‘Kipi’ is associated with childhood, obviously, in a very endearing and positive way. And my dad is a very positive and vibrant person,” she said. “That name just embodies a lot of what I cherish within that youthful perspective. There’s a lot of playfulness and wonderment about the world.”
“Since it was such an important name for me,” she said. “I knew whatever I did with it could not fail.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My voice was lost, drowning in the silence that engulfed me.
It was the night of the State of the Union. I decided to stay in and watch President Donald Trump’s address to Congress from the comfort of my dorm, anticipating the toll that it would surely take on my mental health. I also feared the insensitivity inherent in the discourse of my fellow students. Certain students actively dominate conversations on this campus, frequently speaking over the silence of marginalized students.
As an undocumented immigrant living in a time of uncertainty, I had no other option but to watch the State of the Union to remain updated on the state of my future.
I watched as Trump used the victims of MS-13 gang violence to sell his racist agenda, unrightfully demonizing the lives of all 11.3 million undocumented immigrants to increase anti-immigrant sentiment. I watched as he explained his immigration plan, which would increase security at the border, cut legal migration, and impede my parents from ever becoming citizens of the country they call home. I watched as the camera panned to show a room full of politicians who have failed to act and vote on immigration reform, despite promises made on both sides of the aisle.
Afterwards, a few friends and roommates expressed their frustration with the president’s remarks. While I shared their sentiments, I lacked the energy to participate in a conversation so directly intertwined with my existence. They kept speaking, but the conversation had already ended. They were talking about me, to me, but not with me. They entered and left the conversation, not noticing my lack of participation. Some people do not have the privilege of continually engaging in political discourse without sacrificing their own sanity.
Having my life at the center of national debate is invasive and emotionally draining. Imagine constantly being exposed to politicians or fellow peers debating your humanity every time you log into Facebook or enter your common room. Imagine having to defend yourself again and again, explaining why you and your family deserve not to be separated and deported. It is exhausting. I am exhausted.
This is not to question or doubt the sincerity of those participating in these conversations but merely to address a bigger issue. As Harvard students, we have been taught to constantly engage and contribute to conversation. Sometimes, however, it is best to simply listen.
This incident was not the first time I had felt suffocated by my own silence on this campus. During section, in Annenberg Hall, and over dinner with my advisor, I have been exposed to conversations that highlight a cultural insensitivity to the very real and visceral experiences that some of us have to endure. I have entered these spaces and have been expected to discuss topics that directly impact me, yet my more privileged classmates (most of whom have only ever read about these issues) are the ones that dominate the conversation. Unlike them, I am the one that must live with the daily implications of the issues we discuss.
There are better ways to express sympathy than readily offering a lukewarm opinion on the politics of my life. This constant need to speak up is seemingly inherent to the type of students that wind up at a place like Harvard. However, constant engagement is harmful to campus dialogue. It discriminates against people from marginalized communities, as it becomes mentally taxing for them to continually convey their lived experience in order to provide a “diverse perspective.”
I resort to silence because speaking up leads to the exhaustive work of educating my peers, a task that has repeatedly fallen on the backs of people of color on this campus.
There are emotions so complex, engrained by trauma and constant exposure, that make it nearly impossible to contribute to a conversation in an articulate manner. My silence is justified, but it wouldn’t have been necessary if maybe those around me had tried it. Somewhere in their silence exists the room for me to engage—if I choose to do so.
People should be as willing and ready to listen as they are to engage. Taking up too much space in a conversation that is so personally connected with someone’s identity subconsciously oppresses them by invalidating their experiences. Instead, Harvard students should be making space for marginalized people to speak up.
Rather than expecting the oppressed to be responsible for their education, the silence of those affected should be a lesson in and of itself. The political climate might change, but the sentiment remains the same. I am more than a policy decision, and I shouldn’t have to explain that to you. My silence is not an invitation for you to speak— it’s an invitation for you to listen.
My silence should be heard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an email to Harvard affiliates on March 19, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced his decision to step down from his post. Smith’s decision came as University President Drew G. Faust’s tenure enters its final two months, following a decades-old pattern of FAS deans stepping down shortly after University presidents do.
Smith’s departure follows a decade of financial and economic change. In Smith’s second year in office, the 2008 financial crisis necessitated deep FAS budget cuts. During this time, he froze faculty salaries, reduced staff searches, and put a pause on the construction of the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus in Allston. Indeed, he was instrumental in handling a number of important fiscal decisions. During his tenure, FAS passed its $2.5 billion fundraising target in Oct. 2016, four houses underwent renovation, and financial aid programs grew. In an era when the University has been struggling with poor returns on its endowment, Smith’s financial and managerial decisions were crucial for the school’s continued success.
As we look back at Smith’s tenure, we are pleased with his performance, and it is clear that his work has had a tangible impact on campus. Yet, with two other deans—Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris—leaving their positions this summer, we continue to be concerned about the ramifications of losing yet another senior member of the FAS leadership in short succession.
For the foreseeable future, Harvard faces even more House renewals and the construction of a new campus with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s move to Allston. Financial leadership is crucial at this juncture, and we hope that Smith’s replacement is just as, if not more, competent at managing the debt and donations that come with such extensive changes to the physical landscape of the University.
Smith’s accomplishments as the Dean of FAS are not strictly financial. His dedication to increasing faculty diversity has proven valuable to the larger Harvard community. Indeed, he has overseen FAS during a period of great growth with respect to diversity. Of those on a tenure-track, 63 percent are now women—the highest percentage anywhere in the University. At the same time, in FAS’s science division, 46 percent of tenure-track faculty are now women—a relatively figure for the sciences. We hope Smith’s successor values diversity among the faculty as much as his predecessor and works to continue the trend that Smith started.
During this transitional time for Harvard, we call on Smith, incoming University President Lawrence S. Bacow, and all other administrators to ensure that the transition period is quick and successful. Furthermore, we hope that the new dean of FAS is given the support required to continue the legacy of success left by Smith.

The phrase “fake news” rolls off the tongue so easily that I use it to label everything from false news stories to my mother’s concerns that I don’t eat enough breakfast at college. I am surely not the only one guilty of using the phrase to dismiss things I do not like hearing. President Donald Trump, for example, has often used the allegation of “fake news” to cast aspersions on stories that he does not like.
Despite its increasing overuse, the phrase “fake news” points to a real problem. We are usually focused on the “fake” in “fake news.” The rise of egregiously false stories and their financially motivated creators makes us less informed and more distrustful of major American institutions. A recent MIT study found that false stories spread faster than true ones on social media. Technology companies, journalists, and politicians have all acknowledged this, and are trying to combat the problem.
However, eradicating egregiously “fake news” should not be the end of our efforts to reform American media. The news that is not “fake” is presumably “real.” But something that is “real” is not necessarily “good.”
In television media particularly, there are pressing problems that do not fall under the “fake news” umbrella but that should still be addressed. These issues have more to do with what is “news” rather than what is “fake.”
“News” may be a slight misnomer for what programs on channels like CNN, MSNBC, and Fox air. “News analysis” is a better descriptor of their activities. These popular shows are still technically sources of information, since they have to establish the facts before analyzing them. But the news commentators on these shows have no obligation to be unbiased, as they discuss and debate the facts at hand.
Therefore, I think the distinction between “news” and “news analysis” must be made clearer to the public. Even the president struggles to realize the difference. In a recent tweet complaining that coverage of his impending talks with Kim Jong Un went from pleasantly surprised to dismissive, Trump concluded that “the news became FAKE.” But presumably, the media reported the fact that talks would be happening, and then moved on to analyzing that development, which they were free to do, but in a way with which Trump disagreed.
In the past two years, many have raised concerns about how the mainstream media is too liberal. Maybe this perceived bias was the problem Trump was railing against in his tweet. Media bias is a legitimate problem, but not one of “fake news.” In terms of strict definitions, the genre of news analysis cannot be “fake” because it is not “news.”
The most popular figures in television media can help distinguish the genres of their shows by being clearer about their own positions. Are they journalists or talk show hosts? Journalists are held to a higher standard of accuracy because their job is to report the news and to leave their opinions out of their work. Talk show hosts or commentators, in contrast, have more leeway because they are explicitly being paid to share their opinions.
Many anchors’ own vacillations about this distinction add to viewers’ confusion. For years, Sean Hannity, host of a radio show and a Fox primetime show, defended his work by saying that he is “a talk host” and has “never claimed to be a journalist.” In Nov. 2017, though, Hannity reversed course and said, “I’m a journalist.” Rachel Maddow of MSNBC has also dodged the question of whether she is a “journalist or commentator” by calling herself a “cable-TV host.” Yet in 2016, she figured prominently in MSNBC’s presidential election coverage, a role typically reserved for news anchors, not liberal commentators.
One might argue that the question of whether these media figures are journalists is not important because their fans already trust them. But perhaps that is the problem itself—that millions do trust them without knowing whether they are really paid for the news they share or their opinions about it instead.
Another group that deserves more attention is the pundits brought onto these shows to comment on specific topics. Usually television channels will give them titles like “political commentator” or “contributor.” But these vague titles do not clarify that they are paid to share their opinions, not necessarily the facts. Controversial commentators who play loose with the facts, like Fox analyst Andrew Napolitano, or who have conflicts of interest, like former CNN contributor Corey Lewandowski, may even be more valuable for ratings. Again, the quality of pundits is not exactly a problem of “fake news,” but hiring them more judiciously and making their positions clearer will improve the opinions being provided to the American public.
The rise of the phrase “fake news” has forced a reckoning with our media. Let’s not stop halfway. We should of course continue to target what is fake. But we should also clarify what is news.

Geophysics professor Jeremy Bloxham will end his tenure as dean of science for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the conclusion of the 2017-2018 academic year, after a decade serving as the inaugural administrator in this role.
Bloxham, who studies how planets generate magnetic fields, was first appointed FAS divisional dean for physical sciences in Aug. 2006, succeeding Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, a technology and physics professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.   After the integration of the life and physical sciences divisions in Fall 2007, Bloxham assumed leadership of the combined FAS science division. As dean of sciences, Bloxham has overseen the division’s finances, coordinated departments’ academic planning, and advised FAS Dean Michael D. Smith on faculty appointments within the division.
According to colleagues, Bloxham will continue his work in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department after stepping down from his administrative role.
“We are all deeply appreciate of Jeremy’s service as Science Dean, and look forward to welcoming him back to the Department,” EPS Department Chair John H. Shaw wrote in an emailed statement.
Kimberly M. Moore, a graduate student in Bloxham’s research group, praised his commitment to his work as dean of science.
“He’s been dean for a long time,” Moore said. “He’s done a lot of service for the university.”
Bloxham currently serves as a co-investigator for NASA’s Juno probe, which is a spacecraft that began orbiting Jupiter in 2016 to study the structure and interior of the planet.
“Jeremy and his group, they’ve been working on computer simulations to understand, when we measure these magnetic fields around Jupiter, what does that mean in terms of the interior structure? What’s going on inside of Jupiter?” EPS professor Roger R. Fu ’09 said.
Fu said that although Bloxham’s focus is on theory and modeling of planetary fields, he has also made contributions to the collection and processing of recorded data.
“One thing that Jeremy does really well, I’ve always felt, is that he’s not just purely a modeler,” Fu said. “He did some really interesting work, like compiling some really old ship records over the last few centuries, to keep track of magnetic field variations on the surface of the Earth… So he kind of crosses the line towards observations also, and it’s very impressive when someone does both things.”
Astronomy Department Chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb commended Bloxham’s dedication as dean and said Bloxham’s background as a scientist brought a valuable perspective to the position.
“We were very fortunate to have him as dean of science throughout the past 12 years,” Loeb said. “As a scientist, he had a very good understanding and sympathy for science and promoted science in the best way possible here at Harvard.”
Loeb said Bloxham was instrumental in helping increase the diversity of tenure-track hires in the Astronomy department.
“Over the past seven years that I was department chair, Dean Bloxham was very generous with us,” Loeb said. “He would listen to our concerns and do the best he could, and he would always try to be on our side and help us in different ways.”
“I think it stemmed from the fact that he was truly a scientist,” he added. “He knew where we were coming from.”
According to Loeb, Bloxham also played an integral role in the establishment of the Black Hole Initiative, an interdisciplinary center dedicated to the study of black holes.
“[Bloxham] and Dean Smith provided us with the space for the Black Hole Initiative, which is, as far as I’m concerned, one of the best places at the University to be in,” said Loeb, who is the Black Hole Initiative’s director. “It’s not just the space—they also provided us with the support to renovate the building from its previous configuration. On behalf of the Black Hole Initiative, without Dean Bloxham, it wouldn’t be the way it is now and wouldn’t be as successful as it is now.”
In 2007, The Crimson reported that Bloxham declined an offer by then-University President-elect Drew G. Faust to become FAS dean in order to stay on as the dean of physical science.
Loeb said Bloxham—as the inaugural holder of his position—fundamentally shaped the science deanship during his tenure.
“The position of dean of science emerged with Jeremy, and he gave it meaning that we very much appreciate,” Loeb said.
The Harvard Magazine reported in March that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Smith have begun a search for Bloxham’s successor.

UPDATED: March 24, at 5:50 p.m.
Rappers Wale and Lil Yachty will headline this year’s iteration of Yardfest, the College’s annual outdoor spring concert, the College Events Board announced Thursday evening.
Wale, a Washington D.C. native, is known for songs like “Bad” and “The Matrimony,” and has released five albums since 2009.  Lil Yachty is known for “iSpy,” which peaked at the #4 spot in the 2017 Billboard Hot 100, “Broccoli,” which reached #5 on that list, and “One Night."
“The College Events Board is incredibly honored to bring Lil Yachty and Wale to campus for this year’s Yardfest on April 13th,” CEB co-president Jackson M. Grigsby ’20 wrote in a press release. “Our committee has worked extremely hard in the last few weeks and months in preparation for the event, and we expect the concert to be fantastic.”
Student performers 21 Colorful Crimson and Disco Band will open for the rappers after winning CEB’s “Battle for Yardfest” event Thursday evening, which drew students to Sanders theater to watch ten musical groups compete for the opener spot. 21 Colorful Crimson comprises seven performers from the class of 2021, while Disco Band is made up of 13 artists. 
Grammy-award winning DJ Tiesto drew hundreds of students to last year’s Yardfest, despite overcast clouds and a rainy forecast. Recent headliners have also included DJ Steve Aoki, Jessie J, Janelle Monáe, Sara Bareilles, and Tyga.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 24, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Disco Group will open for Wale and Lil Yachty at Yardfest 2018. In fact, the group opening for Wale and Lil Yachty is named Disco Band.

Two gender neutral bathrooms at Harvard Law School that were previously inaccessible for most of the day will now have 24/7 access for students, after student groups raised the issue with administrators
The bathrooms, located on the second floor of Wasserstein Hall and near Harkness Cafe, were set behind two security doors that restricted student access when the cafe—which is open from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. on weekdays—was closed.
The building holds other gender neutral bathrooms in the basement and in the clinical wings, but some students said they felt these locations were not sufficient.
Lambda, the BGLTQ organization for Harvard law students, and the Queer and Trans People of Color organization brought the issue of restricted access to gender neutral bathrooms to administrators last fall.
Gender neutral bathrooms are not limited to Wasserstein Hall. Both Han Park, co-president of Lambda, and Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells said that there is access to other gender neutral bathrooms on campus and this was an isolated issue.
In an interview Sunday, Park said fellow members of Lambda notified him of the inconvenient location of the bathrooms.
“What’s happening is that the only other gender neutral bathrooms in the building itself is either in the basement or they’re in the clinic wings,” Park said. “So what would happen is if somebody needs to use a gender neutral bathroom, they would either have to go all the way down to the basement to use the bathrooms or have their I.D. on them and also have the knowledge that the clinic wing is usable by students, which you don’t know unless you’re in a clinic.”
Sells said in an interview last Thursday that Lambda and QTPOC had reached out last fall and that the administration had been working with them throughout the year.
“I have heard this claim from the fall and have been working with Lambda and QTPOC all along on this,” Sells said.
Sells described possible solutions including the provision of I.D. card access to students who wished to use the bathrooms and eventual reconstruction of the doors, promising that the work would be completed by the end of the academic year.
“It will be done,” Sells said.
In an email Monday, Sells wrote that temporary construction had been completed and the bathrooms were now accessible to students.
“Work was completed this past week on temporary doors that now allow 24/7 access to the second floor Gender Neutral bathrooms near the Hark entrance. Further work will be needed in order to place permanent doors and trim, but that will happen at the end of the academic year,” Sells wrote.
While Park said he is happy the administration resolved this issue, he said he wished the resolution had been addressed more quickly.

Two weeks after the Harvard Sailing Center first began sinking into the Charles River in the wake of a powerful Nor’easter, the Harvard sailing team is still without a permanent training facility for the rest of the spring.
University spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in a statement on Tuesday that although the barge beneath the center has been “restored,” the facility will be closed for the remainder of the season.
“The floatation device underneath the Harvard University Sailing Center was damaged by the winter storm impacting the area on Thursday, March 8th,” Goldman wrote. “It has been temporarily restored, but will remain out of use until the conclusion of the sailing season in the spring, at which time we will determine the next steps for this facility.”
Although the facility is no longer at risk of sinking, men’s captain Nicholas Karnovsky ’19 said the team is still taking account of the financial damage and lost gear that resulted from flooding in the men’s locker room.
“I would say at this point only four or five men on the team are missing some gear,” Karnovksy said. “It’s hard to value that right now because we’re still trying to figure out what people lost exactly, but it’s probably several hundred dollars a person.”
Karnovsky said while “it wasn’t a complete surprise,” that the 47 year-old building sustained damage during the storm, the damage was “way more drastic than anything that has happened in the past.”
In the meantime, the team has been sailing out of MIT’s boathouse, just a quarter-mile away from the sailing center. Karnovsky said that while the team is grateful to MIT for hosting them, sharing facilities with two other teams can be complicated.
“We switched to practicing out of MIT’s facility, they’ve been extremely gracious to host us,” said Karnovsky. “The Northeastern team also sails there so there’s just a lot of teams at their boathouse at once so it’s just been a little complicated to get everyone into the right boats and out of everyone’s way.”
Karnovsky said one of the biggest challenges the team faces is not being able to use all of their boats due to limited dock space.
“Half the boats that we have access to are on our docks, but we don’t have enough dock space so [the rest are] still hanging in our boat house,” Karnovsky said.
Women’s captain Jessica R. Williams ’20 said that despite the relocation from their home training facility, the team is focused on finishing out the rest of the season. The team has won races for the past two weekends.
“I think everyone is really on the same page in that we’re a team, and this Harvard sailing team isn’t the boathouse,” Williams said. “Even if the boathouse is no longer used it really depends on our own dedication and commitment, and we’ve been doing pretty well the past two weekends so I think that that shows.”
In an email, head coach Michael O'Connor praised Williams and Karnovsky’s leadership on the team, and echoed their beliefs that team is set on moving forward.
“I am very pleased with our team’s ability to stay focused on our goals. We are determined to keep improving and sailing to the best of our abilities,” O’Connor wrote. “Jess Williams and Nick Karnovsky have done a great job leading the team through all of these recent changes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten students traveled to Puerto Rico over spring break as part of the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Alternative Spring Break program to help in the ongoing efforts to clear the debris left behind by Hurricane Maria last fall.
PBHA’s Puerto Rico program was one of four service trips run by the organization from March 11 to 18 and was the latest effort on behalf of Harvard students to support people affected by the storm.
Hurricane Maria hit the island country in Sept. 2017, leaving 64 confirmed dead and many more missing. Many people in the country still remain without power or running water.
The students on the trip helped to clear debris and trees from properties in regions outside of the capital, San Juan. Francisco Matos Jr. ’20, one of two trip leaders, said while much of the aid Puerto Ricans receive comes in the form of money or food, many people still need assistance removing rubble and other debris from their homes.
Six months later, the aftermath is also taking a psychological toll, according to Matos Jr.
“The main focus of this trip was to actually visit people in person, clean out their yards, remove trees, but also to be there one on one with them, because sometimes that’s really all you need, someone there with you. Just having someone to talk to for ten minutes makes your day. We sought to help out as many families in that community as possible,” he said.
Matos Jr. said when the group arrived, they began to realize the larger scope of the problem and the help still needed.
“In a lot of cases, they would ask us something that we couldn’t do, because we’re ten students from Harvard, not construction workers. Some of these people still don’t have rooms on their houses, and they’re asking for a friend at this point because it doesn’t seem like it’s going to get any better," he said.
Brian K. Lai ’19, who led the trip along with Matos Jr., noted the stark inequality present on the island between the capital and surrounding areas.
“In San Juan, there’s a lot of efforts made, and it’s restored for the most part. But every single day we would travel to a town further out, and one place needs all the help they can get, and the other is doing fine, because there’s a lot of mainland American businesses,” he said.
Yasenimary Velazquez Carrasquillo ’21 said seeing the remnants of people’s lives left behind in the wreckage of their homes was impactful.
“The family had a wooden house before the hurricane, and the hurricane just blew it away. All the debris and the walls were on the mountainside. You could tell that they had lived there, because they had all their jewelry and their wedding stuff. It really hit me: ‘All these people went through all of this,’” Velazquez Carrasquillo said
Access to clean water and electricity in the wake of the storm still remain pressing issues—in the six months after the storm, 32 people had died in the community Harvard students visited because of these problems.
Matos Jr. said he hopes to lead another service trip to Puerto Rico this summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Firefighters rescued two construction workers who fell almost two stories while working on Harvard’s Science and Engineering complex Wednesday afternoon.
The SEAS complex, a 500,000 sq. ft. facility located in Allston, is slated for completion in the fall of 2020. President Faust and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh directed the placement of the final steel beam in Dec. 2017, marking the completion of the complex’s framework.
At 2:17 p.m. on Wednesday, the Boston Fire Department responded to a 911 call, which reported that two workers had fallen approximately 20 feet from the fifth floor to the third floor. Harvard Police and Boston Police also responded to the scene.
Turner Construction Company Vice President of Communications Chris McFadden wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that the workers were on “a temporary stair scaffold” when they fell.
McFadden wrote that authorities were immediately notified and workers transported to the hospital.
“The cause of the incident is under investigation," he wrote.
Marc Sanders, a spokesperson for the Boston Fire Department, said that the fire department categorized Wednesday as a “tech rescue response.”
A technical rescue response, Sanders explained, occurs in any situation that “exceeds normal fire suppression.” He said the department sends firefighters who are trained in navigating confined spaces to conduct these rescues.
“Anytime there’s a technical rescue, it’s never routine. There’s always a certain number of variables and obstacles you have to overcome,” Sanders said.
Sanders described the various complications of coordinating a rescue from a construction site.
“A building under construction—there are numerous hazards there, so it’s usually done with a quick scene size-up to assess the situation, and then they quickly devise a plan and execute it,” he said. “Not knowing what caused the workers to fall would weigh in the firefighter’s minds, because they don’t want to fall themselves.”
Sanders, who was on scene during the rescue, said that Harvard Police and Boston Police did an “excellent” job directing traffic and pointing the department to the site of the fall.

In response to a safety concern about two key pipes running through Harvard-owned land, water resource authorities assured Allston residents that sewage and water pipelines will not be impacted.
The Massachusetts Water Resource Authority owns a pipe running near Harvard’s science and engineering complex and another under its proposed center for innovation—the “Enterprise Research Campus.” As Harvard develops its plans for the campus, some Allston residents are concerned about the potential dangers of these pipes.
Harvard first announced its intentions to build a center for entrepreneurship called the “Enterprise Research Campus” in 2011. The University hired real estate agent Steven D. Fessler to lead the construction of the area in April 2016.
In March 2018, the Boston Planning and Development Agency, the city’s urban planning body, approved of Harvard’s initial plans describing a 14.1-acre portion of the “Enterprise Research Campus,” allocating 400,000 square feet of land for office space, 250,000 square feet for residential space, and room for approximately 800 parking spaces.
At the BPDA board meeting last week, one Allstonian raised a question about the pipes running under the enterprise campus. Residents also discussed the pipe during the Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee meeting a couple of weeks ago.
Allstonian Ed A. Kotomori, the co-chairman of the subcommittee, said Harvard seemed “concerned” about the pipes during the University’s presentations on the Enterprise Research Campus.
“Our concern is that the future construction will probably involve a lot of pipes, a lot of steel going into the ground, which would result in a lot of shaking in the land out there, with a possibly of damaging the pipe,” he said.
Kotomori said a sudden pipe leak could cause “a lot” of environmental damage without people noticing immediately, and that it was also possible for a burst pipe to create “a sinkhole.”
MWRA Deputy Chief Operating Officer Carolyn Fiore said the organization “carefully” reviews planned development projects. She said that the MWRA will continue to ensure that the sewage and water pipelines are not impacted or disrupted.
Fiore said the organization ensures that “there wouldn’t be any construction in a place that would impact us negatively.”
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email statement Thursday that “Harvard has communicated to MWRA that initial plans call for new utilities in the ERC to eventually cross over existing MWRA infrastructure.”
“All plans will go through MWRA’s required permitting process, and any eventual approval will include designs for how these utilities can cross over and protect existing sewer lines,” O’Rourke wrote.
In addition, the Boston Water and Sewer Commission also has pipes in the area.
Communications Consultant Nicole Kieser wrote in an email Thursday that Harvard’s construction is unlikely to interfere with the water and sewage systems that Allston residents use.
“More likely, neighbors may in fact see an overall enhancement in their services,” she wrote.

Changes mandated by the sweeping Republican-backed tax bill passed in Dec. 2017 likely reduce the tax incentive for some mid-level donors to give to Harvard—nonetheless, higher education experts say the bill’s ultimate impact on charitable giving is hard to predict.
When filing their taxes, Americans can select one of two options to claim deductions from the government: they can opt for a lump standard deduction or instead choose to itemize their taxes and receive deductions on each eligible category.
The December legislation changed the calculus for some American taxpayers choosing between the two options. The new system increases the size of the standard deduction—meaning 21 million fewer Americans now benefit from itemizing their taxes as compared to taking the standard deduction, according to an estimate by the Tax Policy Center in January.
This could be bad news for organizations that depend heavily on donations—including  institutions of higher education like Harvard—because itemization tends to incentivize donations given that it offers a deduction specifically for charitable giving. The standard deduction option does not.
Elizabeth L. Clark, senior director of federal affairs at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said she is concerned the tax bill could decrease giving to universities. Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment is heavily funded by charitable donations.
In fiscal year 2017, the University received $1.28 billion in donations, ranking first among all American colleges and universities.
“For some taxpayers, the charitable deduction has in the past served as an incentive for charitable giving. We think that, with fewer itemizers, that incentive is gone for a number of taxpayers,” Clark said.
Nonetheless, Clark said it is difficult to anticipate the bill’s final effects on philanthropy in the United States, calling the legislation’s impact “unclear.” She said she hopes there is not a “significant downturn” in donations to higher education.
New York University law professor Harvey P. Dale also acknowledged the bill could reduce rates of charitable donations. But he pointed out the bill could have the opposite impact—the smaller overall tax burden possible under the new legislation could foster a greater willingness to donate.
In one example of this reduced tax burden, the bill decreases the tax rate for individuals in the top income bracket by almost 3 percent, from 39.6 to 37 percent.
“Tax rates are going down for at least a lot of people, and that leaves people with more money, and so if you look at the wealth effect, instead of the tax effect, there may be more money in the pockets of people who would be willing to give more,” Dale said.
Last November, University President Drew G. Faust said Harvard was working to assess the impact of provisions in the bill that relate to charitable giving. She also described a second way the bill could deter potential donors to the University.
Faust said she was concerned the 1.4 percent excise tax on endowment returns imposed by the bill—which would have cost the University $43 million if it took effect in 2017— could negatively affect charitable giving.
“One of the issues I’m concerned about is how the endowment tax might affect charitable giving to universities,” she said. “If I give to this university, it will be taxed. Whereas if I give it to someone else—a hospital, a scientific research center—it won’t be taxed. Does that disadvantage us in comparison with other charitable options?”
Despite all this, some alumni say they remain staunchly committed to donating to their alma mater.
Peter L. Malkin ’55, the namesake of the Malkin Athletic Center, said changes to the standard deduction are unlikely to deter major Harvard donors—including himself.
“My feeling is that those who are really committed to support Harvard with great affection for it will not be influenced by this,” Malkin said. “I think if anybody were to be influenced, it would influence people who give donations in smaller annual amounts where they no longer itemize the deductions.”
Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60, a former Crimson editor and a former member of the Board of Overseers, said neither the endowment tax nor other changes in the tax bill will affect his donations.
“My taxes are not a factor in my decisions about donations,” he said. “I realize that for some people it has to be, but I’m fortunate that it isn’t.”
“[The endowment tax] doesn’t deter me from giving to Harvard,” he added.

As it expands its Allston footprint in the coming years, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will also seek to cultivate stronger industry ties, according to Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III.              
In a March interview, Doyle said one of his priorities is to establish a stronger connection between SEAS and corporations, a move that will bring the school more in line with traditional engineering heavyweights including Stanford and MIT.
According to Doyle, SEAS was historically less connected to the industry because of its scientific focus and its smaller size. Eleven years ago, when SEAS became its own school, it only enrolled 291 students, or around 6 percent of undergraduates.
“A recruiter coming to look for, say mechanical engineering students or electrical engineering students, could count on maybe two hands the number of candidates that might be coming out from our program,” Doyle said. “So they were not necessarily going to prioritize our stop, even if they were coming through the other part of Cambridge, down in Kendall Square.”
Over the decade, however, this scale has “fundamentally changed,” according to Doyle.  This year, SEAS has a record high 1,013 concentrators enrolled, which he said has accordingly raised the school’s profile among technology and engineering firms.
“So we’ve invited a number of big companies over the last couple of years, and we’ve got this semester alone a number of companies coming through that have never really visited, spent time with us,” Doyle said.
Doyle also said he sees corporate relationships as an opportunity to encourage a growing fraction of SEAS faculty to pursue industry research collaborations and other “creative opportunities.”
“We have a growing number of our faculty, and I put this at about one-third, roughly, and a corresponding fraction of students who are very interested in translation,” he said. “They want to build widgets, create technology, create patents, licensable ideas, create startups, work with companies, do these kinds of translational projects.”
Doyle said he is also interested in using company relationships to bridge the gap between faculty research and real world applications.
“We have faculty who are brilliant in their line, but having folks from the proverbial real world telling them ‘here’s the real challenge, we’ve got to connect this material to material, or make this material work under these conditions.’” he said. “That inspiration I think is valuable.”
Besides internship and job opportunities, and inspiration for faculty applied research, Doyle said licensing and funding are other reasons to “bargain with industry."
He added however, that he thought “our mission as an academic university—students first, and the training—means those [internship and job opportunities] are the most important to me when I think about partnering with industry.”
In order to strengthen industry relations, Doyle said he has recently added a Director of Corporate Partnerships, Ellie G. Carlough, to the school’s staff.
Doyle attributed his perspective on industry to his own experiences with the sector. Before climbing the academic ranks, Doyle spent time at DuPont. He has a portfolio of 17 patents, and part of his research focuses on process control.
“So that’s part of my DNA as well, so maybe I’m infecting some of the faculty this way,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EDITORS' NOTE APPENDED: March 26, 2018 at 2:45 a.m.
Administrators are working to update the Q guide—an online system through which Harvard students evaluate their courses—so undergraduates can use the platform to report inappropriate behavior by teaching staff, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
In another change, the Undergraduate Council—in partnership with Harvard staff—is developing a new training for teaching fellows focused on power relationships at play in the classroom. The training will likely debut this coming fall.
Harris announced the update—which is still being workshopped—at a town hall held Thursday night in Fong Auditorium and hosted by the Undergraduate Council, anti-sexual assault advocacy organization Our Harvard Can Do Better, and the Harvard College Women’s Center. The town hall, attended by roughly two dozen students, faculty, and administrators, sought to foster discussion about the power dynamic between Harvard undergraduates and the professors and staff who teach and supervise them.
The meeting—titled “Power Dynamics in Academia”—comes almost a month after the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 18 women are accusing Harvard Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of repeated acts of sexual harassment across the past three decades. The accusations have roiled campus; over the past few weeks, administrators placed Dominguez on leave, the professor announced his retirement, and graduate and undergraduate students have published multiple open letters denouncing Harvard’s handling of the situation.
In its current form, the popular Q guide allows students to rank their classes and their teachers according to metrics like the difficulty of the class, the amount of work the course requires, and the lecturing acumen of the professor.
Now, though, administrators hope to add a question to the guide that asks whether teaching staff made students feel uncomfortable. After an attendee at the town hall mentioned Harvard’s School of Public Health allows enrollees to report “offensive” comments made by professors, Harris said College administrators are working to add in a similar question.
“We are in the process of revising the Q forms,” he said. “There will be a question of some kind that at least is trying to get at that.”
Harris said administrators are currently workshopping the “wording” of the question. He added that he and unspecified others are planning to discuss the proposed new Q guide question with the Undergraduate Council’s education committee.

“This is a reflection on instructors, so I think that having this on the Q guide—which is an overall assessment of a professor—is intrinsically tied to your experience interacting with the professor,” Palaniappan said of the proposed new question. “It should be included in the overall evaluation of what you would have of them.”
After the event Thursday, Palaniappan detailed the specifics of the new training program for teaching fellows. She said the UC is working with the Women’s Center and the Derek Bok Center on the project.
“[The training] will be given to TFs starting in the fall to really think critically about these different power dynamics, and how they have the ability to really set the tone at the beginning of a section itself,” she said.
Throughout the event Thursday, several attendees said they fear possible academic or career repercussions could deter students from reporting instances of bias or inappropriate conduct on the part of a superior.
In response, Jennifer L. Hochschild, chair of the Government department, mentioned her department is exploring the idea of an “electronic suggestion box” that would allow students to anonymously report misbehavior. Hochschild first announced the idea of the box in an email sent to Harvard affiliates earlier this month.
“We’ve got to figure out how to do this right,” Hochschild said. “But the broad idea is some kind of institutionalized pretty simple mechanism with a very low threshold in which people can anonymously say what’s going wrong, without having personally to come forward.”
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better who helped organize the town hall, said the event itself was meant to encourage students to come forward.
Goldberg said she and other organizers wanted “to make it possible to speak up that ladder and to speak to people in power about what’s going on, and try to bring home to them the realities of what it’s like to be a student at Harvard.”
Faculty members who participated in the town hall said they hope students will take that advice to heart.
“If nobody says anything—and I understand why they don’t—but if nobody says anything, then interventions become impossible,” Harris said.
Leena M. Akhtar, who teaches a course on Gender, Violence, and Power, added that change “has to come from all levels.”
One attendee, Ana Karla Cepeda Diaz ’19, said she was motivated to participate in the town hall after some “thought-provoking” Women’s Week events led her to reflect on incidences of power dynamics in her life.
“I work in a lab, and I see the women in my lab struggle with power dynamics,” Cepeda Diaz said. “To hear from faculty that are pushing for change, and hearing that the Q Guide’s going to change, was huge for me.”
Palaniappan and Goldberg said they appreciate administrators’ recent attempts to hold discussions with students.
“Questions like these are also extremely important because they signal the university’s commitment to these issues. It shapes the landscape for what the university believes are issues that students are impacted by,” Palaniappan said.
Editors' Note: Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris later wrote a March 26 "Letter to the Editor" clarifying the intent and exact meaning of remarks he made at the March 22 town hall described below. According to Harris's letter, administrators are "discussing adding a question to the Q about whether the teaching staff has created a welcoming environment conducive to learning."

From New Mexico to Alabama and South Carolina, the Harvard baseball team has played seemingly everywhere besides its home turf, O’Donnell field. However, with Ivy league play on deck for the team, long flights and unfamiliar teams will be replaced with games in the cold northeastern spring against familiar foes.
The Crimson (7-11) comes out of non-conference play with a losing record, looking to make improvements against Ivy League and other local teams in April and May. Junior outfielder Ben Skinner knows that records, however, do not tell the whole story coming into conference play.
“We currently have the best record in the Ivies,” Skinner said. “That’s definitely exciting for us.”
It may seem foolish to some to be excited about a losing record coming into league play, but it is very much the contrary. Harvard took on a slate of very tough teams in out-of-conference play, registering every single game on the road against opponents in states with weather that is more conducive to playing baseball at this time of the year.
“We ended up playing some pretty competitive teams,” Skinner said. “ Teams like South Carolina, New Mexico State. Those teams are really talented so it's good practice for us to play those top teams before the Ivies.”
Do not expect the incoming slate of games to be any less competitive. Anything can happen in Ivy League play—with familiarity and storied rivalries, games are sure to be close every weekend. Through studying and preparation, the Crimson hopes to use this familiarity to an advantage.
“It's definitely nice when you can remember matchups from years past,” Skinner said. “ We’ll face pitchers or hitters multiple times in their career. Any time you can play to their tendencies and get an extra leg up it's definitely useful.”
Even though Harvard comes in with the best record, nothing is guaranteed. The team knows just how unpredictable league play can be. Only a few years ago, Princeton went from last place in the Ivy League to first in only one year. Teams change and make improvements, and the Crimson is attempting to do the same.
“There definitely some big changes on a yearly basis,” Skinner said. “ Things we work on in the preseason and then non-conference games we try to continue that in the Ivy League. I think we’ve formed a little bit of an identity [this year] as a team.”
That identity may be a team that can make any game close with strong finishes in the end. Harvard showed extreme potential mounting late comebacks against Furman University (13-8). The Crimson began the year strong, taking two games against Samford (10-12) into extra innings and splitting the two games. Harvard also put up two runs in the final frame to beat Presbyterian (5-17, 0-3 Big South) in extra innings. Though not all of these games resulted in wins, late pushes by the Crimson against good programs has built the confidence the team has moving forward.
“Going forward, we just have to carry the same attitude that we’ve carried into the past couple of weekends,” junior catcher Jake Allen said. “We are a good team, and we belong where we are, playing against good competition.”
It was not all positives for Harvard coming out of non-conference play. Winning late isn’t exactly a desired trend, and so the Crimson hopes to get out to better starts moving forward. Though the bats have done their part in several games, the defense and pitching are looking to lower a very high 7.86 earned run average and close the .100 batting differential between opposing hitters and Harvard.
The Crimson has a chance to see these improvements manifested in a doubleheader against Holy Cross (5-8) this coming Wednesday as its weekend series at Princeton (2-10) was postponed. Harvard will play its first Ivy League opponent next weekend at Columbia, and will finally get to return to O’Donnell field to face Boston College in early April.
Players are excited for Ivy League play, and with confidence and improvements echoed throughout the team, fans can hope for successful conference play from the Crimson.
“Everyone really wants to win those games,” Skinner said. “We believe we’re gonna be one of the best teams in the Ivy League this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to forestall playing in the snow, the Harvard women’s lacrosse match against the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, was delayed 24 hours on Wednesday. In effect, the team missed a calm afternoon and instead squared off in the heart of what little storm the Nor’easter provided.
On the snowy Thursday afternoon, the Crimson (3-4, 0-1 Ivy) squad fell 22-17 to its Minutewomen opponents at Richard F. Garber field in Amherst, Mass. Though Harvard led at the break, a stellar second stanza by UMass (5-3) carried the team to victory.
In a game characterized by runs for both teams, the Minutewomen began the second half with a streak of goals that established a lead they never again relinquished. As the second set of thirty minutes began, a goal from senior midfielder Julia Glynn—assisted by Nicole Baiocco—three minutes in pushed the lead to five and the score to 12-7.
UMass controlled the ensuing draw, the Crimson fouled, and in the 18 seconds following Glynn’s point, the Minutewomen had negated the point. The team never looked back. UMass scored again in 42 seconds, and again in 38. Netting eight of nine points in an 8:34 time frame, the Minutewomen claimed a 15-13 lead with a quarter hour to play.
“We started winning draws, which was key,” said UMass head coach Angela McMahon in an interview with the Daily Collegian. “I felt like a good amount of the shots we were taking were high quality, therefore translating into more goals. For us to win the draw, score the goal, win the draw, we were able to create some good momentum there and we fed off that energy.”
The match began favorably for those in crimson and white. UMass rocketed three straight goals before Harvard sophomore attacker Hannah Keating stopped the skid with her ninth goal of the season. Assisted by Tessa Queri, Keating’s strike was followed by one more Minutewomen point before the Crimson’s first period run. Junior midfielder Keeley MacAfee squeezed a shot by UMass’s Lauren Hiller, cutting the home team’s lead to two. An offensive onslaught followed. The six-point run finished with Harvard up, 7-4.
Throughout the first half, the Crimson outscored its opponent by four, with 11 points to the Minutewomen’s seven. The second frame showcased a spirited UMass performance to make up that difference, with the team notching 15 goals to the Crimson’s six.
After UMass’s 8-1 streak, Harvard pushed the margin to one point twice more, first closing the gap to 15-14 and then again to 18-17 with 4:39 remaining. Battling to either tie or grow the lead, the opponents fought for the advantage. A foul from Crimson sophomore defenseman Tate Green granted them Minutewomen just that in the form of a free position attempt. Holly Turner was golden on the shot, drawing UMass’s lead to two. By the final buzzer, that had increased five.
In a game that was far closer than the final score indicated, Glynn recorded a team best seven goals, increasing the senior’s season total to 30.
“We scouted [Glynn] a lot and she came out ready to play,” said UMass junior Holly Turner to the Daily Collegian. “At halftime we just made the adjustment of getting on her hands and stick and making sure to play body and not going for the check.”
MacAfee led the team in points, adding five goals and three assists to the stat sheet. Junior attacker Nicole Baiocco matched MacAfee’s team-high three assists. Queri contributed three goals of her own, tacking a single assist on to her total.
Manning the net, senior classmates Meredith Brown and Olivia Gundrum split their time. The former managed to get between the ball and the goal twice while Gundrum tallied six saves and four ground balls.
Also on defense, rookie Celia Concannon tied her own career high with four ground balls and two caused turnovers. In ground balls, Harvard held an 18-13 advantage over its opponent. In every other category, UMass carried the day. Marginally outpacing Harvard 41-38 in shots on goal, 6-2 on free position shots, 10-8 on saves, and 22-19 on draw controls. The Crimson also committed three more turnovers than UMass.
