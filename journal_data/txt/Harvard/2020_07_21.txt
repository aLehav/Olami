After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My name is Jesper Andersson. I am the president of Harvard’s Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, Massachusetts Gamma, and this is the first time I’m publicly declaring that information.
I am a member of the Harvard Class of 2021, the first class to have the social group sanctions imposed on it. Today, I’m able to write this piece because Harvard has retracted its sanctions against members of single-gender social organizations. SAE has been a second family for me at Harvard, and now that sanctions are over, I hope it can continue to be a second family for many more classes of students to come.
To explain my path to joining SAE, I need to share some personal information. I grew up in a low-income, broken household. My father was never involved in my life, while my mother struggled with alcoholism. In seventh grade, I enrolled in Milton Hershey, a Pennsylvania boarding school that, unlike the archetypal college prep school, serves exclusively socioeconomically disadvantaged students. There, I formed intimate bonds with my classmates, especially the guys I lived with. This second family helped me navigate living away from home, coping with my unstable background, and planning for my future. Come senior year, when my Harvard interviewer offered me a chance to ask her questions, the first one I could think of was: “Did you feel like you had a second family when you attended Harvard?” Without hesitation, she answered “yes,” and I felt confident I could do the same.
But at the end of my freshman year, I didn’t have the second family I imagined I’d have, and my mental health and academic performance were suffering for it. Although I had probably two close friends, I felt that I lacked the support system of housemates I’d grown attached to prior to Harvard. Upon returning to campus for my sophomore year, I knew I had to do something different, so I frantically looked for any opportunity to join a social group. During this search, I received an invitation to an SAE rush event — not knowing anyone in the group. But after that night, I knew where I wanted to be. I felt welcomed by the brothers, and could tell that if I joined, I’d make more than lifelong friendships — I’d gain a second family.
Some people would laugh at me for saying joining a fraternity has been the single biggest part of my Harvard experience. It’s kind of funny, but it’s true — becoming an SAE was the cornerstone for helping me find my path through college. My brothers gave me ears to vent to, inspired me to find and follow my passions in school, and helped me rekindle my sense of “others above self.” From the day I joined SAE, it has been my goal to give others the same experience I’ve had in the fraternity. Before being elected President, I served as recruitment chair on a campus where fraternity recruitment couldn’t be public. Because of these experiences, University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s June 30 email announcing the end of sanctions brought me a wave of joy and a sigh of relief.
While I may not have supported sanctions, I appreciate Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s vision for a more diverse and inclusive social life on campus. His advocacy for mixed-gender social groups has been a step in the right direction. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly believe that, at their roots, single-gender social organizations aren’t a bad thing. At Harvard we recognize that single-gender blocking groups are not problematic because students have the autonomy to choose these groups, which are just one part of the whole Harvard experience. In the same vein, social groups should not be labeled bad solely on the basis that they are single-gender.
With that said, I acknowledge that many fraternities across the country have earned their criticisms and calls for reform. Sexual assault and misogyny are especially rampant on college campuses across the country, and I’d be falling short of my own standards if I failed to address the role of fraternities in this epidemic. In light of this problem, I am proud to say that Mass Gamma maintains a culture of peer accountability by maintaining a no-tolerance stance toward sexual misconduct through our judicial board, educating all new members on sexual assault prevention and consent, and hosting chapter-wide meetings with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response each semester. At events, we have designated brothers to monitor the safety of our attendees, and we will always prioritize the safety of our guests. We serve as a model chapter for others across the country, and as Mass Gamma’s president, I call on other groups to implement (and colleges to require) these accountability systems to address sexual assault.
Another deserved critique of many single-gender organizations is that they disproportionately serve wealthy, white individuals. Mass Gamma prides itself on our chapter’s socioeconomic diversity, and we believe in creating a social space for men of all different walks of life to come together and form lifelong bonds. Furthermore, we prioritize financial aid to ensure that all brothers can comfortably afford membership dues.
Even on our own campus, privilege very clearly manifests itself. Harvard is an institution that favors those from upper-class, white families. To create the culture we strive for on campus — one of ubiquitous diversity — we should reexamine our admissions processes, our diversity education, and our residentially structured experiences. While institutional change is hard, it is necessary to create a more inclusive culture for future classes of Harvard students to come. But from my experience with SAE, which has given me brothers from all different walks of life, I believe that sanctions missed the mark.
As a kid that didn’t know a single thing about how to approach Harvard, I’m grateful for the second family I’ve gained through SAE. For the years to come, it is my hope that SAE is around to offer the same diverse and welcoming space that it offered me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eric Clopper, a former systems administrator at Harvard, filed a lawsuit against the University, The Harvard Crimson, and 10 unnamed “donors and alumni” in federal court Monday over the school’s response to a 2018 performance that he held at Sanders Theatre and the newspaper’s coverage of the event.
Clopper, who formerly worked at the language resource center in Lamont Library, accused Harvard and The Crimson of defamation and libel, violating the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, and other actions that justify damages. His complaint also alleged the University violated Clopper’s First Amendment rights.
On May 1, 2018, Clopper held an event at Sanders Theatre aimed at criticizing the practice of circumcision. At various points during the performance, he stripped nude and referred to Jewish people as “an unmasked genital mutilation cult.”
The Crimson reported on May 3 that the University was “reviewing” Clopper’s show. The next day, the newspaper reported that he planned the event during work hours at Harvard. Harvard terminated Clopper’s employment on July 12, according to the suit.
The suit alleged that Harvard “breached the express and implied employment agreement” with him by accusing him “of having acted improperly and threatening to fire him for having worked on the Play occasionally at Harvard.” Clopper also claimed a Sanders Theatre staffer “physically and threateningly” prevented him from returning to the stage to deliver concluding remarks.
Clopper, who is Jewish, alleged in the suit that The Crimson’s characterization of his show as a “nude, anti-Semitic rant” — which appeared in the headline of the paper’s May 3, 2018 story — was “a patent falsehood.”
Clopper brought a number of additional counts against the University: breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of the employment agreement and free speech policy, breach of the contract for Sanders Theatre, tortious conversion, and a promissory estoppel claim.
He also accused The Crimson of interfering with his employment contract and conspiring with Harvard to defame and steal the play. The Crimson is editorially and financially independent from Harvard.
“It is plausible that The Crimson’s defamatory coverage of Clopper’s Play caused Jewish donors and other stakeholders to exert pressure on Harvard via harsh letters, communications, and other quid pro quo arrangements to retaliate against Clopper, which resulted in the loss of Clopper’s profession and other damages,” the lawsuit reads.
Clopper has requested $500,000 in compensation for damages from the defendants.
Crimson President Aidan F. Ryan ’21 declined to comment on the lawsuit. Harvard representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.
