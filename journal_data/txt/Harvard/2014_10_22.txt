After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To read a novel like David Bezmozgis’s “The Betrayers” in this mighty age of American literary mass-production is like getting to nibble on one of those small, precious slabs of black-market chocolate in “1984.” Aha! is the feeling: here is a book that recalls what fiction can do! Its quality is concentrated in every part, not scattered about and diluted. Because of this, and because it is invested with a solemn, almost nostalgic seriousness in its elevated treatment of human relations, despite its contemporary setting it resembles Orwellian chocolate in being a kind of smuggled fare from the past. One may consume it, as with the chocolates, in a certain permissible mood of joyous, rapacious greed.
Befitting its aforementioned seriousness, the story has a severely simple premise: former friends Baruch Kotler and Chaim Tankilevich meet again in Yalta after 40 years apart. Both bear the weight of a heavy role that life has thrust upon them: betrayer. Kotler, an intellectual and an Israeli national figure, has just betrayed his family for the sake of his people; he refused to side with corrupt politicians who threatened to expose his affair with a young woman, and while the press hawks descend on his personal life he has fled abroad with his mistress. Conversely, decades ago Tankilevich betrayed the Jewish people—denouncing his Zionist friend Kotler to the Ukrainian KGB—for the sake of his family. Now, for a single day in a shabby Yalta hotel, the paths of betrayer and betrayed cross again. What will come of it? Revenge at last? Or mutual forgiveness and healing? But either of those outcomes would be too easy for a writer like Bezmozgis, whose handling of the situation is anything but simplistic.
Bezmozgis doesn’t flatter his characters. He knows their vanities and failings, though at the same time, he also gives each the dignity of accepting their own faults. As a result, every figure in his book is brilliantly drawn: entirely credible, but also unique and strangely biblical. Who could ever forget Baruch Kotler’s supremely cool dismissal of his blackmailer? “Mr. Amnon, I hope I haven’t given you the impression that we are engaged in a negotiation. There is nothing in those photographs that would lead me to change my mind. Rest assured, I have a healthy appreciation of my own vulnerabilities.” On the other hand, Tankilevich’s melodramatic demands for pity represent another kind of absolute pose: “Here’s your old enemy,” he says to Kotler. “The despicable beast. The disgrace of the Jewish people. See how fate has settled its accounts with him. Give your girl a good laugh at his expense.” The gentleman doth protest too much, one thinks; his speech is distasteful. Yet he is so determined to be recognized as the aggrieved party that he pays no attention to how much he overdoes the act. Tankilevich and Kotler’s behaviors are ill-advised, but somehow there is a lovable chutzpah in their unabashed greed for their desires—Kotler for his political principles, his childhood happiness, and his sensuality; Tankilevich for his moral and social redemption.
Greed. That is the strongest feeling hiding behind the restrained ironic prose of this book. It is not just any ordinary greed, in the sense of being greedy for money, friends, or any such trivial things for which people are normally said to be “greedy.” Bezmozgis’s conflicted Jewish protagonists are greedy for life; they hanker after the collective Zionist vision as much as their individual dreams and desires. As betrayers, they feel this greed more keenly than the others; their transgressive acts and the accompanying guilt and stigma have lost them the psychic freedom that other people take for granted. Tankilevich, it turns out, really has been shattered by what he did. At 70 years old he is sciatic, unhappily married, poor. “‘And it is I who have borne the consequences all these years,’” he tells Kotler. “‘To this day!’”
Not only does Bezmozgis offer a strong revelation in the paradox that when we betray somebody else we are really betraying ourselves, and many more times over than our victim. He knows, moreover, how to animate this truth with the skills of the master storyteller: grace, precision, compassion, and in this case, Jewish humor. His voice is often Tolstoyan in its easy immensity, as in this passage showing Kotler’s yearning for his mistress: “Through the fabric of his trousers, Kotler felt the warm, birdlike weight of her hands…. Fodder for comedy. And yet, the girl’s fingers slipping between the man’s thighs dispelled comedy. In its place, the leap of animal desire.” These sentences are short but substantial. Only two adjectives, “warm” and “birdlike,” are used; Bezmozgis instead embraces the primal power of the noun, enabling Kotler to mentally progress from male trousers to “comedy” to “the leap of animal desire”: more and more powerful and sublime.
The word “comedy” above certainly hasn’t been “dispelled” from the novel at large, which everywhere brims with it. Later, Kotler wryly observes to his mistress, “‘As is often the case in life, one imagines an opera and gets an operetta. If that.’” These bitter yet funny remarks are not uncommon in the novel; for, more than betrayal, this is a story about life’s disappointments and about the necessary comedy of our self-deceptions in the face of such disappointments. Bezmozgis’s delicious and consoling Jewish humor comes to the rescue of his menaced characters.
One scene in particular reflects this silver-lining quality of the book: after describing a bleak day in the streets of politically repressive 2013 Ukraine, Bezmozgis takes the reader inside a synagogue with Tankilevich and reveals the beauty of the place, its quiet stoicism: “The shabbiness that marked the rest of the building and the neighborhood was not to be found there. The mahogany tables and chairs were sturdy, built for epochs.” These words could describe the quality of the book containing them: sturdy, built for epochs. And, like the air inside this resilient synagogue, oddly comforting against a background of nearly universal gloom.

Ah, daredevil, daft, delinquent “Dan.” Yes, it could be worthwhile to read this feisty little novel, which was written by Joanna Ruocco and published by an innovative women’s literature group called Dorothy, A Publishing Project. But the worth would not be in its pleasure so much as its pain. The book’s style is an anxious stunt, and its content is a gross chimera of suburban fantasy, parody, and the absurd. Ruocco doesn’t like to feed her readers easy food, so getting through her book the first time around can be tortuous. What's disappointing, however, is that even on a second go “Dan” doesn’t deliver enough; it only continues to dangle its provocative linguistic goods in front of the long-suffering reader’s eyes, ignoring the possibility that said reader may have tired of mere striptease acts. But there will always be works of art whose value is more in what they gesture to than what they are, and “Dan” is a respectable addition to their numbers.
The novel's title refers to a fictional village that is presumably located somewhere in contemporary America. Ruocco withholds geographical specifics; we know only that Dan is a swampy, down-at-heels backwater town set low in the hills. Rumor has it that some time ago, “the town of Dan was a pleasing patchwork of family farms criss-crossed by sportive sheep and grains of golden pollen.” But nobody really knows. There is collective amnesia in Dan, and throughout the book Ruocco hints at Dan’s sinister aspect—“The population of Dan was not large, yet somehow it was difficult to account for all of the residents”—without ever entirely explaining it, which is disappointing. She does haphazardly go into great detail now and then. At one point readers are told, for instance, that buildings in town are infested with snails; elsewhere, that the people of Dan spend every day gorging on bakery pretzels and taking up bland hobbies to pass the time.
Enter Melba Zuzzo: young woman, bakery worker, and, pun unintended, Ruocco’s utterly half-baked heroine. Melba is one of Dan’s few remaining females, a fact that Ruocco delights in pointing out: “When Melba was a young child, far too young for high school, a group of women had disappeared from Dan. They were older women, old enough to bear some responsibility for Dan’s circumstances.” Most other women have died or disappeared since, and now Dan’s men are ganging up on Melba. In the span of a single long day, one of them after another—there’s grumpy neighbor Grady Help, Mark Rand the greedy landlord, Mr. Sack the lecherous history teacher, Officer Greg the grunting policeman, and Don Pond, who is too good to be true—will subtly menace her.
Ruocco has a promising idea here: the Kafkaesque estranged hero with a modern gender spin. To be fair, some of it is well brought off. The amusing Melba is said to be “a provoking daughter, quarrelsome, with habits befitting an earlier kind of person, a person from pre-history.” Her contrarian persuasion is a joy to observe in action. Witness her exchange with Mr. Sack, who propositions her many times: “‘Mr. Sack, I have a problem,’ whispered Melba, almost breathless, ‘I just can’t figure out what time is made of.’ Mr. Sack worked a mauve lollipop out of his pants pocket and he offered it to Melba without speaking. She ignored it.” Melba’s chaste ignorance of male desires, especially her unawareness of just how appealing and dangerous she is in her refusal to pipe down and suck on their male pacifiers, is one of Ruocco’s best running gags.
Yet soon enough the reader gets impatient for a development of Melba’s provocations. True, she does awaken to the absurdity of Dan life.  But “awaken” is too generous a word—she doesn’t ever stumble out of the Platonic cave. At most she sights the entrance. Now and then Melba brushes against existential issues like whether life is worth living, but these insights are awkwardly made: “Love is something you find in someone, you search and search, sometimes in the dark, or blindly, like a miner with a pickaxe or like a star-nosed mole.” Or: “Some things are always useless to scrutinize, maybe most things, maybe everything.” “Maybe” is the key word for Melba. Ruocco allows her the briefest of epiphanies: “She saw a spark that began to ripple and then she knew no more.” After this “spark” she spends the rest of the book immobilized on couches and table-tops, trapped by Dan men.
Certainly much of the problem with this book is Ruocco’s failure to give Melba enough credit. Her eternal cloudiness of insight makes the book frustrating and, overall, a disappointment, since the reader is also often put in a demeaning position like her, uncomfortably snailing through, occasionally seeing a stray spark, then no more. Melba’s neuroticism as a character is not endearing; she makes the reader wince and disapprove of her strivings, her frequent blurting out of non sequiturs —“Owls don’t give birth in the air ever?”— and her unremitting lack of tact.
More problematic is the stylistic inhospitality of the world of “Dan” itself for the reader. Ruocco tries to parody clichés of writing, as in the following passage accounting for the disappearance of Dan’s women: “The blame did not rest squarely on Ann Dump. The blame could not be conceived of as a regular polygon, contained and conventionally dimensional. The blame was a bigger, murkier object, with drifty quality that frightened Melba. The blame hung in the sky over the valley. It was like humidity! Or a curse!” Does it matter whether Ruocco’s playing with the word “squarely” leaves good taste behind? The book is a grotesque joke that makes one smile in collusion, but not laugh; at some point, one gives up on its gaudy excesses and resolves just to sit politely through the rest of the show.

What happens when you combine Greek mythology with teen angst and dark humor?
You just might end up with “Carrie and Otis,” an original play running at the Adams Pool Theater from Oct. 23 to 26. Written by Mike C. Ross ’16 and directed by Megan G. Jones ’16, “Carrie and Otis” offers a window into the lives of three man-eating Sirens and presents a delightfully timeless interpretation of classic lore.
In the play, the three Siren sisters Lorelei (Taylor L. Vandick ’16), Marilyn (Madison M. Dildine ’16), and Carrie (Rachel C. Talamo ’18) struggle to define their relationships with other as well as their senses of identity and purpose. Youngest sister Carrie’s distaste for her sisters’ man-eating habits—she’d like to get to know people rather than eat them—becomes an exponentially larger problem when amiable mariner Otis (Adam S. Wong ’17) comes into her life. Audience members well-versed in Greek mythology may recognize parallels between “Carrie and Otis” and the "Odyssey.”
“We usually think of Greek myths as centering around [the hero],” Ross says. “But what about the people who were there before [the hero] and are left behind after he leaves?” In this sense, “Carrie and Otis” tells the story of those characters usually overlooked in myths—the monsters.
Despite its mythical origins, the story of “Carrie and Otis” remains relatable and is heavily driven by a core of female characters. “It’s easy to get caught up in this ‘star-crossed love story,’” Talamo says. “But there’s a lot more. This is a story about Carrie developing herself and becoming more mature. She becomes the strong person that she’s always wanted to be, in ways she never expected.”
“Carrie and Otis” also stands out as a modernized interpretation of Greek legend. The script regularly has characters referencing Beyoncé and “The Gilmore Girls.” Stage manager Diana M. Smith ’17 says, “For me, the main pull of ‘Carrie and Otis’ is that it’s based off a story that everybody has at least heard of. It’s accessible. I think it’s really well written, and it’s been pulled together in a…funny…[and] touching way.”
The debut of “Carrie and Otis” is especially exciting because it is a student-written work, which fosters creativity and continuous revision, especially with writer Ross present at all rehearsals.  “We’re always collaborating, editing, and discovering new things,” Vandick says. “Our characters are truly our own.”
When asked what she loves most about directing “Carrie and Otis,” Jones takes a moment to appreciate the abundance of artistic production opportunities at Harvard. “I think it’s important that people realize that this is student-written, original theater,” she says. “I think that we as a theater community really have a need for original theater…. I’m hoping that when people see this show, they’ll realize that we can take student theater and work with it and stage it, and if you’ve written something that you care about, you can absolutely have it seen by other people. That’s so incredible, and that doesn’t just happen anywhere.”

Once in a while, there comes along an issue that cuts to the core of American insecurities and inanity. Today, that issue is Ebola.
America is worrying too much about a disease that probably will not affect most of its citizens. The paranoia Ebola is causing is probably disrupting daily affairs more than the disease itself.
Sure, it is important to be aware of the disease and show concern. Sure, the government is making the right decision by screening all individuals coming from the West African countries where Ebola has become a worrisome issue. And sure, Ebola has no known cure yet, and that makes it a difficult disease to handle.
But the chances of contracting the disease are extremely low. And the countries where it poses a real problem have relatively poor public health infrastructure and higher rates of poverty. The United States, on the other hand, has a much more developed infrastructure.
Ebola is not transmitted the same way as many other diseases. It is not airborne, and the only way to contract it is through the bodily fluids of an infected individual when that individual is showing symptoms. One American has died of Ebola in the past month; about 35,200 died in car crashes in an entire year. And yet Americans will continue to go to work, drive at unsafe speeds, and text while driving.
And there are conditions and diseases that are more widespread and more likely to affect people based on their lifestyles, such as diabetes, obesity, and food poisoning. How many people do we see use the bathroom and not wash their hands? And how many of those people use those same unwashed hands and eat or touch their face? If news channels broadcast constant coverage of the dangers of un-washed hands, Americans would be in a frenzy to buy and use hand sanitizers and soap, trampling each other in grocery stores.
And what about guns? Over 9,000 homicides are committed with guns in a year in this country, most of them by disadvantaged inner-city youth. But there’s far more media attention devoted to Ebola than to trying to improve the lifestyle of these youths. Attacking the source of the problem by spreading awareness would be much more useful than hopeless gun bans, and yet homicide does not seem as salient in the collective American mindset as Ebola does—maybe because it is not perceived to be as imminent.
What’s more, the United States has proved relatively insensitive to Ebola before this now. The disease was first discovered in a breakout fever in Sudan in 1976. That was 38 years ago. And since it caused over 1,000 deaths. Where was our response and hysteria then? Why must we wait for it to come to us?
Ebola is only a problem for us when it affects us. American lives apparently matter more than those of others. Those African countries that have been affected by Ebola for decades were screaming for help, for research to find a treatment, for a way out. But we covered our moral compasses, refusing to lend a helping hand.
This immature and untimely response to Ebola is our own fault—we did not care about it all before, when we could have helped to contain its spread, and it has now apparently become the harbinger of death.
And when we do find a cure, it will be time to pat ourselves on the back for doing a great job. Now, the whole world can be free of Ebola because of America!
And perhaps it could have been free of it a long time ago, if only Americans were not so egocentric.

Taking advantage of a beautiful fall day this past weekend, I pumped up the tires of my bike, oiled the chain, and set off on a journey to Walden Pond. Seventeen miles of bone-jarring bumps and cuss-inducing close passes by reckless drivers later, I found myself pedaling into the spiritual home of Transcendentalism and one of its most famous theorists, Henry David Thoreau.
To begin with, the absence of bike racks proved irksome, especially considering that that I was visiting the hut of one of the great proponents of self-sufficiency. The original structure was demolished and partially rebuilt as a pigsty, though you can poke your head inside a replica built roughly 10 steps from the parking lot. A park ranger, who called Thoreau “Henry” as if reminiscing about an oddball great uncle, suggested that I meander half a mile along the shore of the pond to the original site of his shack.
Hoping for solitude, I made my way to the site, only to happen upon a boisterous family engaged in a shouting match. The children began throwing rocks at one another, eliciting a growl and a “you’ll pay for this tomorrow” from the mother.
Thwarted, I left the home site and set off on a path through the woods. It was hemmed in by a rusting barbed wire fence to prevent visitors from straying from the trail, erected in apparent contrast to the spirit of Thoreau’s existence at Walden. When I finally came upon a gap in the fence, I began crunching through the woods in spite of the warning signs, the words of Robert Frost echoing in my head.
I finally settled on a sun-dappled knoll overlooking the pond and, leaning against a tree, took out a notebook. Trying to conceal myself from any passing park rangers, I reflected upon “Civil Disobedience” and Thoreau’s arrest for refusing to pay taxes as the wail of a police siren from a not-so-distant four-lane highway wafted through the trees.
Walden Pond, I’m saddened to say, has for the most part been spoiled, victimized by tour buses and triathlon types swimming laps in wetsuits. It has become a means to an end, ignored for its true beauty as a spot to be merely appreciated instead of used as a public park (or as a amusement park, as was the case in the late 19th century).
Thoreau famously retreated to Walden in search of space and time to pursue his passions. He was essentially a squatter on land owned by fellow Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson, and he aimed to do as little labor as possible while there so as to maximize his intellectual productivity. Though two years of his life were consumed by his experiment, the project was never all-consuming. Many label Thoreau a dilettante for welcoming guests to his hut and strolling back to town for dinner on a regular basis, but I think it makes more sense to interpret his actions as a sign that he was never a slave to one particular ideology or way of life.
In my experience, Thoreau possesses a unique ability to enchant high school and college students who read his work for the first time. How many of us wouldn’t love to retreat to a secluded microcosm of our own design, shrugging off the fetters of life in society in order to unearth our genuine intellectual selves? For some, a gap year fits the bill. For others, a year or two between college and graduate school might suffice. But this desire to escape the constraints of life at Harvard is really misguided.
I think that our college has become another Walden Pond—a fallen idyll that, having captivated the imagination, lets us down at the end of the long journey here. There’s no need for Harvard to be that way. You can use this place for the academic equivalent of endurance sports or as nothing more than a mindless holiday from the pressing responsibilities that await, but you can also do as Thoreau did and use this time for something loftier.
We’ve been handed our beds and our meals for four years. We have the key to one of the world’s great libraries, and all the pens and paper we could want. Unlike Thoreau, we don’t even have to chop our own wood. Who says that four years at Harvard can’t be every bit as intellectually formative as two years at Walden?
I never really experienced Walden Pond in the way that I’d hoped, and I’m probably still mired in what Emerson called “the sluggard intellect of this continent.” Harvard remains a means to an end instead of an end in itself, to loosely paraphrase Kant. Yet it doesn’t have to be that way: Thoreau produced several books while at Walden and still had time to hike for four miles each day and grow his own food. There’s nothing to stop you from reclaiming Harvard as a Walden of your own.

Gender parity for tenure-track faculty hires was finally achieved in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences this past year, according to a draft of the Dean's Annual Report. Although the faculty, at its all-time largest size, is still heavily imbalanced, we are glad to see that new hires have demonstrated Harvard’s commitment to empowering women in academia. We hope this commitment will continue, and over time, achieve full gender-balance in the faculty. In the pursuit of this goal, we urge the university to not neglect equal opportunities for advancement within the tenure track, as well as entering it.
Historically, Harvard and other institutions of higher education have struggled to hire and retain female faculty. Across universities, women have clustered disproportionately in the non-tenure track. Because tenure is generally earned with work in the critical decade between 30 and 40, which is also the decade in which women tend to have children, women in academia are often forced to put one goal on hold for the other.
However, Harvard’s effort in recent years to emphasize the creation of a pipeline for women in academia should be praised, as well as its effort to create family-friendly programs for faculty, including millions of dollars invested in child-care centers and subsidies and grants that enable junior faculty to take children on field trips. This year’s promising gender balance will hopefully continue in future years, in the hopes of eventually reaching full gender equality.
However, the mere entrance of women into tenure-track positions is not enough: Harvard must also ensure equality in the rate of advancement. At Harvard, where tenure is only granted to full professors, which may make it especially difficult for women to ascend into senior academic positions. Tenure-track women in academia frequently face different challenges associated with maternity than even women in other professions. According to a study of married, tenure-track professors with young children, male professors are far less likely to take paternity leave, and furthermore, those who do may use the time to complete research or publish papers. This puts women at a further disadvantage.
While there is no perfect or easy solution to gender equality in Harvard faculty, it’s important to celebrate this achievement with a critical eye to the future. The faculty’s gender makeup remains disproportionately male-heavy, with 532 men and 198 women. To achieve the gender-balanced future we would like to see, we must guarantee equality throughout the tenure track—and not just at the start.

A sterile term like “secular stagnation” could strike fear only into the heart of an economist. But it could be the malaise that defines the economic prospects of our generation.
Secular (here used in the sense of “persistent”, not “nonreligious”) stagnation refers to a long-term climate of low economic growth. In the conventional wisdom, booms should follow busts; recessions should be followed by a periods of high employment and inflation. America technically exited recession in 2009, but the past five years certainly haven’t felt like a boom. In fact, there’s every indication that the economy is operating far from its full potential. Until recently, unemployment has remained stubbornly high, and inflation has stayed low. This continued under-performance in the face of conventional theories about the business cycle is secular stagnation.
But secular stagnation’s roots may reach even farther back than the recent recession. Bubbles should overheat the economy: Inflation should rise, and unemployment may fall to unnaturally low levels. But during the housing boom of the mid-2000s and even the halcyon Clinton tech-bubble years, unemployment was never unusually low and inflation remained stable. In other words, the two largest asset bubbles in recent history produced essentially normal macroeconomic conditions. According to the secular stagnationists (an awkward coinage, I’ll grant), this implies that the economy may need bubbles to reach its full potential.
The theoretical causes of secular stagnation are a little murky. Depending on who you talk to, you will get a different answer. In the original Larry Summers and Paul Krugman flavor (vanilla, if you will), the problem is a shortfall in demand—an aging population with cautious saving habits would create an environment of lower interest rates, which would reduce private investment. This has been Japan’s recent experience. Other theorists point to supply-side constraints: a slowdown in innovation, or a decline in labor-force participation.
Whatever your flavor, the potential costs of secular stagnation are worth taking seriously. When there is an economic downturn, ordinary people rightly focus on the tangible symptoms: massive layoffs and stagnant wages. But secular stagnation, if it exists, would also have a pernicious hidden cost: the lost output from goods not created and investments not made—in economic jargon, opportunity costs. Secular stagnation means that millions of people who would have had jobs in ordinary conditions will not have them; material wealth that in another circumstance could have improved quality of life will simply never exist.
Admittedly, in delving into secular stagnation’s implications we have committed the classic economist’s mistake of assuming too much. Critics of secular stagnation as a concept point out that there’s an epistemological problem: It’s very difficult to distinguish secular stagnation from a poor but prolonged turn of the business cycle. Only in hindsight can we judge if a trend is secular or temporary—and even then economists will disagree.
Economists have not had a great track record with long-term predictions. Three days before the 1929 Black Tuesday Crash, Yale economist Irving Fisher pronounced that “stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.” Secular stagnation is no exception to this unfortunate pattern: Harvard economist Alvin Hansen coined the term in the late 1930s to describe his prediction that the United States’ growth potential had been played out. The US economy responded to Hansen by tripling in size from 1940 to 1960.
This criticism is perhaps a little unfair. Secular stagnation is not without precedent; Japan has struggled with low growth and negative inflation since the 1990s—a “Lost Decade” that has dragged on for twenty years. I think the appropriate reaction here is sympathetic skepticism. The secular stagnationists have yet to advance a clear theoretical case for their view, but their empirical evidence is compelling. And the implications of secular stagnation, for the economic welfare of our generation, merit at least thoughtful consideration.

Maybe you overheard an unusually piscine conversation as you crossed the Yard. Maybe your roommate made a cryptic comment on the way to dinner. Maybe you’ve been tossing and turning at night, haunted by images of moderately-sized whitish fish. There’s a conversation going on at Harvard, and it’s all about swai. Below, you’ll find all the things you never wanted to know about this curious creature.
1. It’s an endangered species.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, years of aggressive overfishing have dramatically reduced populations of wild swai. While this may sound concerning, you can hold off on your guilt for now. The vast majority of swai on the market (including every squishy, catfishy white fillet ever served in a HUDS dining hall) is produced in large-scale farms, where populations are going strong.
2. It goes by a ridiculous number of different names.
Swai’s other names include Vietnamese catfish (though swai is not actually catfish), iridescent shark (it’s not shark, either), and basa (which is deceptive, since basa is actually a different species). It’s also marketed as tra, sutchi, and pangasius hypophthalmus. The reason for this abundance of titles is a little sinister: the sale of the fish under certain names has been wrought with scandal. It’s illegal to sell basa in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, and sellers can no longer market it as “catfish,” formerly a common practice.
3. It’s environmentally controversial.
HUDS sources its swai from a company (North Coast Seafood) that buys exclusively from Vietnam. Many of these Vietnamese sources (including 5 of North Coast Seafood’s 9 suppliers) farm the fish directly in the Mekong Delta, a practice which adds 2 million metric tons of mud and waste to the water each year. In response to accusations made earlier this year, HUDS stated in a Facebook post that “You'll…read that there are companies with poor practices whose swai products are being embargoed by the FDA, but they are not companies with whom we do business.”
4. It might not be as clean as HUDS claims.
Rice farm runoff is a big problem in the Mekong Delta, resulting in E. coli levels much higher than the legal limit. Other surprising substances, such as antibiotics, have also been found in closely-related species such as basa farmed in the river. In fact, reports from the three external health and safety ranking systems employed by North Coast Seafood are ominous: one labels swai “Not Recommended” and another identifies “Some Concerns”.
5. It’s cheap.
Swai is one of the most affordable fish on the market, with a selling price of about $4/lb. To put that in perspective, that’s more than a block of frozen chum (~$3/lb) but less than a bag of fresh chum (~$5/lb). Of course, we’re sure the pricing has nothing to do with the fish’s presence on the menu.

Breaking news: the dream of the ’90s is alive in our very own Barker Café. On Oct. 16, hipster Harvard students and professors were finally relieved of their pent-up anguish and at last given a quality coffee stop besides the distressingly mainstream Lamont Café or pricey Square establishments. With its student discounts, gourmet quiches, and undeniable ambience, Barker Café aims to offer a relaxing, unbeatably cool atmosphere befitting Winona Ryder wannabes and esteemed scholars alike.
Let’s set the scene. You walk into the Barker Center in desperate need of an afternoon pick-me-up. Once you hit the moose antler chandelier in the lobby, you hear the faint sound of nondescript elevator jazz emanating from the rotunda. In a trance, you’re drawn in, following the bitter smell of Counter Culture coffee brewing. You enter. Welcome to beatnik paradise.
The Barker Café serves a smorgasbord of unique gourmet cuisine HUDS just can’t seem to emulate. Hummus dishes, cheddar squares, ratatouille…it’s like a trip to a quaint bistro overlooking the Seine. Miniature French pastries and scones are temptingly displayed in a glass case, unfailingly offered to each customer by a slightly glum barista, fittingly dressed in all black. Warm, dim lighting brightens the perfectly distressed leather couches and wooden tables, breeding an enigmatic aura conducive to an afternoon of anonymous studying.
Despite this cool aloof vibe, jovial spirits abounded in the Café during its grand opening. Students in plaid shirts and Wayfarer reading glasses cheerfully indulged in giant chocolate chip cookies, and professor Diana L. Eck, gleefully exited the café exclaiming “Coffee is delicious!” over the jarringly loud jazz techno background music.
Of course, as with all new businesses, a few things could be improved upon in the Barker. While pre-made sandwiches with pretentious ingredients are a drastic improvement from HUDS’s suspiciously green falafel, the baguettes are overly refrigerated, so all customers must channel the table manners of John Belushi in Animal House when taking a tough bite of their sweet potato, goat cheese, and pesto sandwiches. Moreover, coffee shop music should be soulful, mellow, and, most importantly, as unnoticeable as possible. The supposedly “carefully crafted Spotify playlists” completely reject that sentiment and instead opt for a mix of blaring trombones and electronic beats that sound like a Louis Armstrong record reproduced by will.i.am. A softer soundtrack would drastically up Barker’s sought-after cool factor.
Décor-wise, the café should invest in an interior designer, or, better yet, a feng shui expert. The neutral parchment-colored curtains leave a lot to be desired, and the couches are oriented in such a way that only allows for groups to sit next to each other, rather than across from one another, reminiscent of a first date from hell. Most confusingly, the clock is situated to the side of the room approximately six inches above the trash can. Barker employees may want to throw a little art on the wall to add some colorful flavor, rethink furniture placement, and, of the utmost importance, find a better place (almost anywhere) for that clock.
After a few minor repairs, Barker Café will be a worthy space for future Jack Kerouacs to brood over a steaming cup of black coffee and a cranberry scone.

Today, while traversing that long Siberian stretch from Northwest Labs to Adams, I fell in love. I fell in love with the most beautiful man I have ever seen in my life. The laces on his dirt-smacked boots had come untied. His washed jeans, slung sinfully low on his hips, smirked at me across the space that is the stopping of heartbeat when one first catches sight of one’s soulmate. Above these denims was more denim, a jean shirt flapping in the wind. And atop this curated ensemble, perched oh-so-precariously, was a knot of hair, a man-bun, as it is colloquially epitheted, balancing and shimmying to and fro with each pounce of a step.
(Please note: for the remainder of this article, the “man” in “man bun” will refer to anyone who desires to be identified as a “man.” I do not support the gender binary. I do, however, support the purposeful use of “man” in “man bun,” as opposed to “boy,” because a whole chasm of difference exists between these two spheres of identity. I am looking at you, average dating prospect of 02138.)
The man bun is a paradox. On one hand, it suggests the sensuality of an artist, a man who spends an entire Sunday afternoon tasting the air and bringing to life with charcoal pencil the form of a voluptuous nude, a man who can’t be bothered to grab scissors from the kitchen drawer for a trim, a man who engages all five, and perhaps even six, of his senses deeply, reverently. On the other hand, it suggests a lone lion in the billowing grasses of the Serengeti, lazily flicking his sight over a herd of soft gazelles, until one catches his eye, and suddenly he becomes a coiling ball of tension, ricocheting toward what will surely amount to all-consuming pleasure. It suggests the hunt. The most primitive pursuit.
In a college where “have you started the pset yet” and “HUDS is serving potato pierogies!” are the foremost preoccupations of the student mind, a man-bun is a welcome reminder of the better species we once used to be. Before the frivolous institution of higher education and all its nefarious siblings (pseudo-intellectualism, dialectic debate, social studies) rampaged through our history, we were a simple group of beings, with simple, pure thoughts and simple, pure actions. Constructs such as “the gender binary” and “social capital” had not yet sullied our thinking. We were a wild conglomeration of individuals, surviving one with nature in the jungles and deserts and ice caps of the far-flung regions of the world. The man-bun is a throwback to all that. It recalls to mind our most basic instincts.So go forth, men! Grow out your hair! Let those manes roam free! At the very least, it is a recognition of our primordial selves, and all our urgent desires.

This is a public service warning about a phenomenon taking over the trendster world.
You’ve seen it around. Shang, the hot warrior from Disney’s Mulan has one. Orlando Bloom has one, when he’s not sporting a blonde elf wig or...actually what is Orlando doing these days? David Beckham has one; it’s blonde and soccer chic. Shia LaBeouf has an adorkable lil’ nub of one.
Enter the man bun: worn by celebrities, emulated by wannabe hipster boys, stealing the hearts of fangirls across the nation. A Tumblr is dedicated to this abomination: it’s an infinite filtered-photo scroll of men with sensitive eyebrows, and wavy locks effortlessly caught into buns at the nape of their necks or the top of their heads.
The man bun says to world: I’m cool. I’m chic. I’m potentially a samurai warrior. Want to grab a drink after work/indie concert/art gallery opening? The man bun seems to have it all.
Except when it doesn’t. In fact, the man bun possesses a fatal flaw. Its trendy history is too short to reveal the devastating truth. It is more like a slow acting disease, because, in about 15 years or so, men wearing buns will enter the depths of despair.
You see, the man bun is directly correlated with traction alopecia, otherwise known as going bald. Remember those cool Japanese samurai warriors? Remember how the top of their heads are also completely bald? That’s the doing of the man bun. Remember Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons? How about his greasy receding hairline? Yep, man bun again.
Picture a young, attractive male celebrity. Now picture him twenty years older and not completely bald, but bald-ish with just a few remaining wisps of hair, which he has tied into a sadly defiant and scraggly man bun. Horrifying, right? This, unfortunately, will be One Direction’s Harry Styles in his mid-forties.
Remember Prince William’s ginger mane, the one with which he wooed Kate Middleton? His hair, alas, has grown patchy of late. Bits of pale scabby English scalp peek through the royal strands. If the horrors of alopecia haven’t hit you by this point, here’s how it works: every time a man bun is made, a hundred hairs die as they are pulled screaming from their follicles. Make enough man buns, and that bushy mane goes kaput.
Men of the world, don’t do the man bun. It’s too risky. Fleeting, ephemeral coolness will end in decades of regret, when you begin spending hours in front of the bathroom mirror, staring at your naked noggin and ruefully recalling the good ol’ days.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brooks P. Newmark ’80, the first vice president of the Harvard Alumni Association and the frontrunner for next year’s presidency, has resigned from his position amid an ongoing sexting scandal in the U.K., where he is a member of Parliament.
Newmark, who also holds a degree from Harvard Business School and spent much of his career in finance, tendered his HAA resignation earlier this month.
“After his many years of dedicated service to the University, we sadly accepted Mr. Newmark’s recent decision to resign from the Alumni Association’s Board of Directors,” Philip W. Lovejoy, executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association, wrote in an email to The Crimson on Tuesday.
HAA’s Board of Directors will vote in February to fill the spot vacated by Newmark.
Newmark, 56, could not be reached for comment. A request for comment from Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 was not returned.
A conservative representing Braintree, England, and a member of the Cabinet, Newmark allegedly sent sexually explicit images over social media to a woman named Sophie Wittams, a supposed Tory PR worker, in September. Wittams, though, was actually a virtual character created by Alex Wickham, a contributing writer to UK’s Sunday Mirror newspaper who was investigating whether MPs were using social media to meet women. Wickham contacted other MPs through the fake account in addition to Newmark.
Newmark announced in late September that he would resign from his Cabinet position as Minister for Civil Society following the allegations and pledged not to run for reelection to Parliament in 2015.
The Independent Press Standards Organisation, a British regulator of publications, is looking into how the sting operation on MPs was conducted and whether Wickham entrapped Newmark.
In October, after further allegations of sexting with another female emerged, Newmark wrote to the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mail, “I have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues.”
“Many will regard me as a failure,” Newmark went on to write. “And it is true: behind the outward facade of success and achievement, I have been battling demons—and losing to them. I craved adrenaline and risk. Stress at work drove me to increasingly erratic behaviour. My friends warned me that I was cracking up. I ignored them.”
Newmark, who had two sons graduate from the College, added that he would begin seeking help for depression.
Several members of the Harvard Club of UK, of which Newmark is a member, declined to comment on the allegations and the impact they may have on the club. An HAA event scheduled for Oct. 17 at Parliament was postponed indefinitely.

UPDATED: October 22, 2014, at 5:10 a.m.
Computer science, biomedical engineering, and mechanical engineering are the three undergraduate teaching areas at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences whose faculty and facilities are slated to move to Allston in 2019, members of the school’s leadership said this week.
Applied mathematics, applied physics, electrical engineering, and environmental science and engineering, on the other hand, will remain in Cambridge during the so-called first phase of development.
A number of institutes and research centers will also relocate across the river, including the Institute for Applied Computational Science, the Center for Research on Computation and Society, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering's Cambridge-based division.
In total, about two-thirds of SEAS faculty will relocate to the yet-to-be-built Allston campus as a result of this division, according to SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff. The school currently has about 80 tenure or tenure-track professors and plans to expand that number by about 30 percent.
“Most of the determinations about Allston vs. Cambridge were straightforward,” Karoff wrote in an email.
The decision about who would move and stay was ultimately made by SEAS dean Cherry A. Murray following a discussion at the school’s May faculty meeting, according to Karoff.
He referenced the “unique facilities” based in Cambridge as a reason for determining which sectors relocated, mentioning in particular the Center for Nanoscale Studies used by several different FAS units, including parts of SEAS.
According to Physics professor and Area Dean for Applied Physics Eric Mazur, most physicists work at CNS on an almost daily basis.
“Relocating that facility would be impossible because it’s also being used by the Physics Department, by the Chemistry Department, by a number of even biology departments,” Mazur said, adding that Harvard invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the center.
Professor of atmospheric and environmental science and Area Dean for Environmental Science and Engineering Steven C. Wofsy said that the collaboration between his SEAS area and FAS’s Earth and Planetary Sciences Department constitutes an obstacle to moving.
“Almost everybody is jointly appointed,” he said. “So if EPS doesn’t move it doesn’t make any sense to move our area.”
However, he added that environmental sciences and engineering may move during a second phase of development of the Allston campus in about ten years.
According to Karoff, there is not yet a timeframe or definite plans for this second phase, even though it is a part of Harvard’s institutional master plan in Allston that the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved in 2013.
Plans for SEAS’s physical campus in Allston are still under development, a year and a half after the move was first announced.
Here is a complete list of faculty research areas moving to Allston in the first phrase of development:
Computer science (including Computational Science and Engineering, Institute for Applied Computational Science, Center for Research on Computation and Society)
Robotics, mechanics, foundry prototyping
Translational life sciences and bioengineering
Soft condensed matter
Soft materials

Eldo Kim, the then-College undergraduate who was charged last week for allegedly sending emailed bomb threats that temporarily shut down campus last December, reached an “unusual” yet “fair” arrangement in avoiding a trial, law experts said this week.
Instead of immediately proceeding with criminal prosecution, the U.S. Attorney asked on Oct. 10 that the court defer prosecuting Kim for 18 months during which time he must complete several requirements listed in his deferred prosecution agreement.
Under the terms of the pre-trial diversion program, Kim will be confined to his home for four months and will have to complete 750 hours of community service. He will also have to pay restitution to the law enforcement agencies that responded to his bomb threats and make a public apology. If he meets these terms, the U.S. Attorney’s Office will dismiss all charges.
Alex Whiting, professor of the practice of criminal prosecution at the Law School, applauded the U.S. Attorney’s Office for being willing to negotiate this deal, adding that attorneys usually feel pressure to prosecute aggressively in cases like Kim’s.
“I think it is a great outcome,” Whiting said. “There are consequences for him that are very real, but at the same time it takes account of the fact that he’s a young man obviously under a lot of pressure who made a bad decision and [should] have an opportunity to remake his life without a felony conviction on his record.”
Experts described Kim’s diversionary program, in which both the prosecutor and the judge had to agree with the proposal, as “unusual,” but justified by his highly unique circumstances. Since 2001, there has been an increased tendency to give deferred prosecution agreements to corporations, but, according to assistant professor at Boston College Law School Kari Hong, this practice has been criticized because the agreements are usually not available to individuals.
“The defense counsel was honestly very talented to be able to convince the prosecution of the equities that are deserving of this outcome,” Hong said. “There had to be very strong convincing equities that everyone agreed upon that led to all three parties to sign off on this.”
These equities must have shown that the crime was an “incredible aberration” from Kim’s normal character, according to Hong. With the help of defense lawyer Allison D. Burroughs, Kim had to establish that he was otherwise lawful and had lived a responsible life, that highly unusual circumstances led to this aberration, and that he is now better equipped to cope with such circumstances.
Immediately following the bomb threat, several lawyers anticipated Kim would face an uphill legal battle. David Duncan, a criminal and civil trial lawyer in Boston, said last December that he was not sure how “charitable a judge would feel” in this extreme case. Now, he calls the results “extraordinary” for federal court.
Duncan also expects Kim will more than likely be able to avoid federal criminal prosecution.
“He must have been completely compliant, and if he’s been compliant for a year, he’s probably going to be compliant for [18 months],” Duncan said.
Without a criminal record, experts say they are optimistic that Kim will be able to start anew.
“Of course he’s going to have to live with the consequences for some time,” Whiting said. “But at the same time I think he will be able to move on with his life.”

Harvard graduate students and staff have started two new queer groups this fall to better serve and unite the non-undergraduate BGLTQ community.
LGBTQ at GSAS—an organization revived from the inactive Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay Graduate Students Association—aims to provide a safe space for queer students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, while the Harvard LGBTQ Staff and Grad Board Game Group offers Harvard affiliates a casual space to socialize.
Founders from both groups said they were inspired to form these organizations after unsuccessfully trying to find the opportunities they were looking for on campus.
Alicia S. DeMaio and Ella S. Antell, co-founders of LGBTQ at GSAS and first-year graduate students, said that they decided to start the group after failing to find a queer student group at the GSAS extracurricular fair this fall.
“Once I found it didn’t exist, I was annoyed. I was shocked and surprised,” DeMaio said. “This should exist.”
According to Antell, the queer student group Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay Graduate Students Association existed since the 1980s but became inactive several years ago. She added that although LGBTQ At GSAS is “administratively” a relaunch of the defunct group, the two groups are otherwise not connected.
The Harvard LGBTQ Staff and Grad Board Game Group was founded in June by Harvard Physics department staff member C. Wilhelm Engelbrecht and doctoral candidate in Chemistry Corey E. Clapp. According to Engelbrecht and Clapp, the group provides a social opportunity different from those available otherwise.
Engelbrecht recalled attending an event at the Queen’s Head Pub hosted by the Harvard Gender and Sexuality Caucus, which is primarily composed of queer Harvard alumni.
“It was pretty loud. People were mingling in groups…. Unless you’re comfortable going up to people you don’t know, it’s not a fantastic way to connect,” Engelbrecht said.
According to Engelbrecht, the group has been successful despite initial difficulties garnering support from departments and organizations. It meets weekly at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and is now officially endorsed by the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality. Clapp estimated the group’s membership at around 24 people.
“We’ve grown fairly quickly for new student groups,” Clapp said. “If you were to infer something from that, it would be that we’re supplying a service that people are looking for.”
Organizers of both groups said they planned to expand their membership and connect with other queer organizations on campus. Engelbrecht noted that the Harvard LGBTQ Staff and Grad Board Game Group hopes to draw more female-identified and queer people of color. According to Antell, LGBTQ at GSAS will be seeking funding from the Graduate Students Council as a next step.
Currently, non-undergraduate queer student groups also exist at the Kennedy School, the Law School, and the Graduate School of Education.

On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education published its finalized amendments to the Clery Act, which mandates that colleges collect and publish annual crime and fire safety statistics.
The Clery Act amendments are part of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which intends to improve the criminal justice response to sexual crimes against women. Earlier this year, the Clery Act added three new categories of reporting: domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. The recent Department of Education amendments, published in the Federal Register, aim to clarify these additions.
The amendments require universities that receive federal funding, including Harvard, to report statistics not only on crimes they investigated and prosecuted but also for crimes determined as unfounded, which universities were not previously required to report.
In addition, the changes also give more attention to stalking and dating violence by requiring reports of stalking to include information about the location where the stalking first began.
"These new rules require institutions to ensure that students and employees have vital information about crime on campus and the services and protections available to victims if a crime does occur, which will be significant assets in addressing the growing problems of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking on our nation's campuses," said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan in a press release.
The new regulations will go into effect on July 1, 2015.

New York Times bestselling author Jonathan Eig discussed his new book “The Birth of the Pill” at Harvard Medical School Tuesday evening, tracing the contributions of four eccentric characters in creating the “miracle tablet” and sharing his insights into the political, medical, and ethical revolution that the birth control pill incited in America and across the globe.
Having written biographies on Al Capone, Jackie Robinson, and Lou Gehrig, Eig veered into a different direction for his fourth book and found inspiration in a sermon his rabbi gave 12 years ago.
“I don’t necessarily think of myself as just a biographer or just a writer of sports stories or anything. I just look for the best story I can find,” he said before the book talk.
At the sermon, Eig said that he heard “the birth control pill was one of the most important inventions of the 20th century.” Though skeptical at first, Eig said he pondered this statement and was struck by its veracity after some research.
“I really began to appreciate the huge impact it made on all of our lives. And then it occurred to me, if it’s so important, why don’t I know anything about where it came from?” Eig said.
The author’s curiosity motivated him to delve into the seemingly impossible feat that four of the “miracle pill” pioneers accomplished in the sixties.
Eig shared the story of female rights activist Margaret Sanger, who advocated for contraceptives and sex for pleasure’s sake among other ideas in the 1950’s. According to Eig, Sanger sought a “miracle tablet that would allow women to turn on and off their reproductive systems."
Alongside Sanger in the suffrage movement was Katherine McCormick, a wealthy MIT graduate who introduced Sanger to Dr. Gregory G. Pincus. Known to many as “Dr. Frankenstein,” Pincus quickly developed a method for preventing ovulation with progesterone—an effort motivated by Sanger’s quest and funded by the wealthy McCormick.
While Eig said that Pincus’s discovery was promising, the ban on contraceptives in 30 states prevented the researcher from recruiting a sufficient number of subjects to test his creation. A gynecologist at Harvard named John Rock was convinced by the importance of the pill and joined Pincus in appealing to women for study.
According to Eig, it was by indirect means, outright lies, and intimidation that the two researchers succeeded in testing the efficacy of the progesterone injection in Puerto Rico and an insane asylum in Massachusetts. Still, he emphasized the crucial role that the pill has played in giving women corporeal autonomy.
“I hope [my readers] realize that the world was very different before birth control, and its impact has been enormously positive and it’s something we still have to fight for,” Eig said. “You can’t let people take away those rights and you can’t let people forget that women have the right to have control over their own bodies.”

One year after the announcement that Cabot Library and the Science Center atrium would be renovated, the faculty committee tasked with overseeing the project has gathered data and produced conceptual designs for the new space, according to Romance Languages and Literatures professor Jeffrey T. Schnapp, who leads the committee.
The renovated space, which will consolidate the first floor of Cabot Library with the adjacent Greenhouse Cafe, among other transformations, will entail an over 80 percent reduction in the library’s print materials, which will largely be replaced by collaboration spaces and data visualization and media tools. Construction could begin as early as the 2015-2016 academic year, although its start could be delayed, according to Schnapp.
“The feeling was that the science library was a particularly interesting library to use as an innovation hub for the whole library system, in part because, in a lot of fields in the sciences, the print storage functions that are traditional functions that we associate with libraries are increasingly secondary,” Schnapp said. “What you really want a library to do is to be a place where people can be involved in collaborative work.”
The faculty committee—which includes representatives from the various departments housed in the Science Center, the libraries, and the Extension School—conducted fact-finding research on the usage of the library and its materials, as well as the quality of the food and space provided by the Greenhouse Cafe. It also evaluated the various scenarios whereby much of the library’s print materials could be migrated online or to the depositories of the Harvard library system.
In early spring of 2014, architects Mack Scogin and Merrill Elam were selected to design the project. While they and the committee have completed conceptual designs, technical designs could take as long as six more months to produce, according to Schnapp.
Schnapp also said that while many of the print works currently housed in the library would be moved off-site or online, the space would still house some curated collections of print acquisitions. He also said that some parts of the mathematics collection, which is still heavily used by members of the Mathematics department, would remain in the science library.
Professor of Mathematics Curtis T. McMullen said that, more than in other quantitative fields, printed mathematical publications remain central to the research conducted within the department.
"Mathematics works have longer longevities than works in other fields. Something published 100 years ago could very much still be pertinent to mathematical research today,” he said. “For a mathematician, being able to browse a physical collection is like having a laboratory.”
Although the faculty committee also conceptualized possible renovations to the basement level of the Science Center, which houses several computer labs and other spaces, Schnapp said that he was not aware that funding had been secured for anything other than the library and atrium portion of the project.
“Whether some of the more ambitious scenarios will get built or not is an open question,” he said. “The notion of reshaping the ground of the basement floor...probably isn’t possible because of budgeting issues. You’re into the hundreds of millions doing this kind of stuff.”

UPDATED: October 26, 2014, at 1:11 p.m.
The first Harvard gallery exclusively for African & African American art, the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery of African & African American Art, opened Tuesday.
To celebrate the event, the Hutchins Center hosted a discussion with curators David Adjaye and Mariane Ibrahim-Lenhardt, moderated by professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and held at the Harvard Faculty Club. The talk delved into the process behind the creation of the gallery as well as the curators’s ideas regarding the significance of the installation.
Afterwards, attendees walked to the new gallery at 102 Mt. Auburn St., next to Peet’s Coffee. The contemporary African artwork displayed was collected by Italian businessman Jean Pigozzi ’74, and was titled “Luminós/C/ity.Ordinary Joy.”
During the talk, Gates recalled how a deal was struck with Ethelbert Cooper to create the gallery.
“[Cooper and I] were sitting there, it was sleeting and he said...I want a naming opportunity. I want my name on something at Harvard,” Gates said to laughter. Gates then told Cooper that no university had created a gallery explicitly for African and African-American art and that this endeavor would be “the greatest thing.”
“And now lo these four or five years later we’re opening the Cooper Gallery,” Gates said. “I mean who says that there aren’t miracles, right?”
A notable architect, Adjaye designed the building by drawing on his roots in Ghana, influenced by the country’s forests. The building’s exterior is covered in a facade of vertical wooden planks.
“When you look at it you’re looking at an abstracted forest that you’re being allowed to enter,” Adjaye said.
According to Gates, the building is 23,000 square feet and holds 98 pieces by 21 artists.  Ibrahim-Lenhardt described how the works were selected from Pigozzi’s art collection of 12,000 pieces in Geneva. Ibrahim-Lenhardt, who previously founded M.I.A. Gallery in Seattle, worked with Adjaye to narrow down the pieces included in the fall display.
“We were able to extract works that have never been shown, ever,” Ibrahim-Lenhardt said.
Gallery director Vera Ingrid Grant coined the display name Luminós/C/ity.Ordinary Joy and helped organize the event and exhibition.
In her opening remarks, Grant said that in the display, “we explore a visual nexus of African urban subjectivities.... The individual works chosen by our curators are each extraordinary and yet they resonate together as a melodic chorus, offering nuanced close readings and vivid renditions of the ordinary and the mundane.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 24, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the address of the Cooper Gallery of African & African American Art. In fact, the gallery is located at 102 Mt. Auburn St.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few days after announcing updated restrictions on travel to Ebola-infected countries, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in a sit-down interview Tuesday that he believes that Harvard students should still be more concerned about the flu than Ebola.
“Unless things change, the greater risk to the health and wellbeing of members of the Harvard community will be from the ordinary seasonal flu,” Garber said. “Which is not to say we’re unconcerned about Ebola, but I think it’s important for people to understand what risks are of various kinds of illnesses and the different ways they might suffer ill health.”
Yet despite what University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira called the very small chance that someone who has recently travelled to an infected country will come on campus with symptoms, administrators from the University and University Health Services have been updating protocols and preparing for various scenarios.
“One of the silver linings to this cloud of the risk of Ebola has been that it’s forcing healthcare providers around the country to think very hard about how to prepare for any kind of epidemic or severe infectious disease,” Garber said.
Per updated travel guidelines released last Friday, any Harvard affiliate planning to travel to high-risk Ebola countries—which currently include Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia—must receive approval from Garber. Garber said Tuesday that while there are some exceptions for essential travel, most students wishing to study abroad or conduct research in the three high-risk countries will not be approved.
Barreira, who joined Garber for the sit-down, confirmed that no student of the University has been in an affected country in the last 21 days, which is Ebola’s incubation period.  He also said that no one is currently in an affected country under Harvard sponsorship or through a Harvard program; there are, however, Harvard affiliates in the region through other programs.
If the situation does not improve, Garber said students who reside in the high-risk countries will be discouraged from returning home during winter break. The University is currently working out the details for accommodating students from Ebola-infected countries who choose to remain on campus during winter break, he said.
“The University and the College are working on arrangements to accommodate students who would not be advised to return to areas that are high risk,” Garber said.
Barreira also detailed the planning exercises that University President Drew G. Faust mentioned in an interview on Friday. UHS has conducted a simulation exercise for front desk workers and nurses on how to handle any patient with Ebola-like symptoms who says they have recently been in a high-risk country. He said these exercises will continue for other UHS employees.
“It’s sort of like CPR in that you have to practice it,” Barreira said. “If you don’t use it you’ll lose it.”
In these exercises, any patient that presents himself at UHS who is suspected of having Ebola will be quarantined in a separate room by nurses equipped with masks, gloves, and gowns, according to Barreira. The next step would be to contact either Cambridge or Boston public health officials, who would then take over the case, starting by arranging the patient’s transport to the hospital, and bring in the Center for Disease Control.
“There’s no way we can screen everyone who sets foot on campus property or who might have some sort of contact with a member of the Harvard community, so we’re very dependent on the effectiveness of general public health measures,” Garber said.
Barreira said that UHS has thus far screened 200 people with no known contact, but has yet to see a patient at low or high risk of contracting the virus.
Over the last few months, the University has reached out to students from the high risk countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Nigeria used to be included in this list, but has since been declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization.
"The University has reached out a couple times checking in and I appreciate it. I appreciate the fact that they are being proactive since Harvard has such an international community,” said Chisom M. Okpala ’15, who is from Nigeria. "There have been no emails about special travel arrangements since Nigeria was just declared Ebola-free.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three grueling hours, 28 back-and-forth games with no resolution, and a third set tiebreak, Harvard men’s tennis freshman Kenny Tao finally hit a shot that Princeton senior and number one player Zach McCourt could not return. The spectators and Tao’s teammates went wild as they celebrated the huge second-round upset.
“It’s very promising to see one of the freshmen do that well against a senior, another Ivy opponent,” co-captain Alex Steinroeder said.
Upsets like that characterized the Crimson’s run at the International Tennis Association Northeast Regional Championships, hosted by St. John’s.
Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 was also impressed by the play of his team’s young guns.
“I think we had some wonderful performances by freshman Grant Solomon, who played the No. 1 seed in the opening round match,” Fish said. “Sebastian Beltrame, a sophomore, beat a guy that played in the top team for Columbia.”
The Crimson wrapped up a long weekend in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., where the team competed against the top players from around the Northeast in one of the first tournaments of the year.
“This is as strong an Ivy League as we’ve ever seen in all my years,” Fish said. “The quality of play was extraordinarily high. We had a bunch of guys who got out a little earlier than we had hoped, but I’m not really concerned because it was a splash of cold water that I think they will respond to…. Overall, I feel like we can do better, and I think the team feels that way too.”
Three of the team members made it past the round of 32 in the singles competition. Steinroeder posted definitive wins against top opponents—including No. 1 seeded Tyler Lu from Yale, Andres Alban from NJIT, and Victor Pugliese from Monmouth—before falling to Columbia’s Winston Lin in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6, in the quarterfinals.
Similarly, Beltrame bested Ivan Kravtchenko from Brown and Robin Lesage from Binghamton before Dovydas Sakinis from Dartmouth got the better of him in two sets, 6-4, 6-2.
Tao, after his upset of McCourt, went on to defeat a player from the Bears before losing in the round of 16.
“It was a good dose of reality for us, because we’ve been training really well and enthusiasm has been really high,” Fish said. “Until you get in against your other regional opponents, you really don’t know how high the bar is.”
The doubles teams enjoyed more success. Beltrame and his partner, Solomon, made it to the round of 16 after two unusually long matches of 13 and 11 games against teams from UConn and Binghamton, respectively.
Steinroeder and sophomore Andrew Ball advanced to the round of 32 following wins against teams from Bryant and Dartmouth.
Co-captain Denis Nguyen and sophomore Brian Yeung, fresh off a close win against Cornell’s Chris Vrabel and Bernardo Casares Rosa in the morning, went on to take home the doubles championship after battling it out with the Big Green’s Sakinis and Chris Kipouras.
“They played exceptionally well against Dartmouth’s team in a match tiebreaker in the third set this morning,” Fish said.
Harvard will be going to the national championships in three weeks. In the meantime, the team can take encouragement from the results of the past few days.
“There’s a long season to go,” Steinroeder said. “So I think there were pretty promising results overall from the freshmen and the upperclassmen.”
From here, the team looks ahead to its upcoming tournament, the UTR Metro Open in Cambridge on Halloween weekend. Having played a trio of tournaments in the past three weeks, the team will welcome the short break.
“We have a couple weeks off now for people to get healed up and rest a little bit,” Steinroeder said. “We have one or two more fall tournaments, so I think people just need to keep working on their game and keep working on playing aggressively.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The Harvard women’s tennis team achieved success across the board this weekend after sending six athletes to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Northeast Regional tournament at Yale.
In the team’s biggest individual tournament of the year, sophomore June Lee made it to the semifinals of the singles division for the Crimson’s best finish of the event.
“June got to the semifinals, which was really great,” captain Sylvia Li said. “She fought through a lot of really tough matches and a couple of three-setters. She played really well, so that was a really good tournament for her.”
Lee tore through the first three rounds of the tournament, defeating opponents from Marist, Boston University, and Dartmouth in two sets each to make it to the quarterfinals. After taking the first set, 6-2, against Columbia’s Tina Jiang in the quarters, Lee dropped the second set, 5-7, to even the match up. The sophomore captured the match and advanced to the semifinals when Jiang was forced to retire with Lee up, 4-2, in the third and final set.
In the semifinals, Lee faced Boston College senior Jessica Wacnik. The first set went to Lee, 6-4, but Wacnik followed up the defeat with a 6-4 win of her own to tie the match up. With the contest tied at four games apiece in the third set, Wacnik narrowly defeated Lee in the final two games to take the match and go through to the finals, where she later claimed the tournament championship.
In total, Harvard posted a record of 11-8 at the tournament across five singles entrants and three doubles teams. On the doubles side, Harvard’s biggest success came from Li and freshman partner Ellen Jang-Milsten. The Crimson tandem advanced to the quarterfinals with three straight victories of 8-2, 8-4, and 8-3 over opponents from Boston University, Penn, and Stony Brook, respectively, before falling, 8-4, to a team from Yale.
“We did a really good job of staying really energetic,” Li said. “We never got down on ourselves. Overall, I think we had really good chemistry, and we were trying a lot of different formations, which...in practice hasn’t been that comfortable for us, but during the tournament it was all coming together.”
Jang-Milsten also competed in the singles draw, where she advanced to the third round. The freshman defeated opponents from UMass and Cornell in straight sets before falling to Yale’s Hanna Yu, who would later defeat Jang-Milsten and Li with her teammate Ree Ree Li in the doubles bracket on their way to the finals.
Harvard’s other participants on the singles side were freshmen Nikki Kallenberg and Annika Ringblom, along with sophomore Monica Lin. Kallenberg won her opening round match, 6-3, 6-4, but was unable to get past Syracuse’s Valeria Salazar in the round of 32. Neither Ringblom nor Lin was able to break through to the second round, as both suffered first-round losses to opponents from Syracuse and Buffalo, respectively.
Lin and Ringblom found more success on the doubles side, where they teamed up to take down a team from Rutgers, 8-5. The two moved on to the second round and were defeated by Salazar and her partner from Syracuse, while Lee and Kallenberg fell in the round of 64 to a team from Boston College.
With the conclusion of the ITAs, the Crimson has now almost completed the fall tournament schedule. After the upcoming Harvard Invitational, which the team will host, the Crimson will move on from the individual fall tournaments and start looking toward the team-based spring matches.
“I think the weekend went well overall,” Jang-Milsten said. “We’re continuing to grow and gain experience together as a team, and starting to mesh together really well. The tournament gave us the opportunity to work on our individual games and see where we are at and where we need to go to be ready for our spring season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the fall semester and the NFL season approach their midway points and the NHL and NBA regular seasons begin, it’s time to check up on three Harvard alums playing professionally.
While Cleveland fans wait for LeBron James to make his highly anticipated return to the Cavaliers, the Browns sit at 3-3 following their bye week. A win this week over the Raiders would give the team its best start since 2007. Desmond Bryant ’09 has been a starting defensive end for the Browns in five of the team’s six games. The 6’6” Bryant has 11 tackles and one sack this year for a much improved Cleveland front seven that has allowed only seven rushing touchdowns this season. Bryant was able to return to the field this year after missing the end of last season with an irregular heartbeat.
There has been no shortage of media attention this offseason for the Los Angeles Lakers’ backcourt, a unit that struggled mightily during last year’s 27-win campaign. The arrival of Jeremy Lin ’10 to Los Angeles became the third biggest story of the summer about a Laker guard behind Kobe Bryant’s return to basketball after an Achilles injury and Nick Young’s relationship with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. Lin was traded to Los Angeles in July as part of a move intended to clear salary cap for the Houston Rockets. The Palo Alto, Calif. native is expected to start at point guard for the Lakers after averaging 12.5 points and 4.1 assists per game for the Rockets last season. The Lakers will have their hands full in a division that features improved Clippers and Warriors squads.
Alex Killorn ’12 has scored two goals in five games for the 4-2-1 Tampa Bay Lightning. The 25-year-old has been playing left wing on the Lightning’s second line with Valterri Filpulla and Tyler Johnson. Killorn, an ECAC first teamer during his senior season at Harvard, is looking to build off his 2013-2014 campaign in which he scored 17 goals and recorded 24 assists for Tampa Bay. The Lightning, which was swept in the first round of last year’s playoffs by the Montreal Canadiens, were recently picked to finish third in the Eastern Conference by Sports Illustrated.

Ahh, autumn. Best season of the year. The leaves are changing, the weather is crisp and cool, and - most importantly the Pumpkin Spice Latte is back. The perfect accessory for instagramming in the yard, taking a weekend apple picking excursion, or just running late to your Ec10 section, the PSL is a fall staple.
Luckily, plenty of other Harvard Square establishments have picked up on the pumpkin spice trend, so you can celebrate the season for every meal. Embrace your basic-ness and go check out these festive alternatives to your morning Starbucks.
Au Bon Pain
The Harvest Pumpkin Soup is no PSL, but it’s a healthy way to get your pumpkin fix—only 140 calories in a small? Sign me up!
Boston Tea Stop
For those looking forward to pumpkin spice boba, prepare to be disappointed - the only pumpkin spice at Boston Tea is their pumpkin mochi ice cream. Isn’t it getting a little cold for bubble tea anyway?
Crema Cafe
Nothing. What a disappointment. Even Greenhouse Cafe bought into the festivities (check out the container of pumpkin spice at the coffee station, right next to the cinnamon.) Do you even #autumn, Crema?
Dunkin’ Donuts
The only spooky thing about the Halloween Pumpkin Donut is the nutritional information: one of these bad boys accounts for 35% of your daily requirement of saturated fat. America had better be running on Dunkin if it wants to keep off the freshman fifteen. Still, count me in for a pumpkin donut. Or five. And maybe throw in a Pumpkin Pie Coolatta for good measure. Because #autumn!
IHOP
The International House of Pancakes embraces the season with “a perfect taste of Autumn,” aka their Pumpkin Pancakes. On the other hand, this is the establishment that serves Kraft Mac and Cheese. As an actual dish. Maybe it’s best to stick to Sunday brunch veritaffles.
Shake Shack
Shake Shack is dipping a toe into the pumpkin spice game, head over this Sunday to check out the flavor of the day: Pumpkin Pie custard.
Tasty Burger
Tasty’s fall special includes $15 for a pitcher of Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale. But is any amount of fall spirit really worth waiting an hour for cheap beer and a burger? Even after 2 a.m.on a Saturday night, probably not.
Tealuxe
Perhaps the only drink that even comes close to rivalling the PSL in basic-ness is the good, old-fashioned Chai Latte. Tealuxe has combined these two fall legends into...drumroll, please... the Pumpkin Spiced Chai! If the name alone doesn’t make you think of pumpkin patch photoshoots, you’re probably doing autumn wrong.
Market in the Square
Though the market does not sell a PSL equivalent, here is where you can buy an actual pumpkin. And it doesn’t get more pumpkin themed than that.

Happy Wednesday, Harvard! It’s crazy to think we’re already in the middle of the ninth week of the semester. We can’t figure out if it’s crazy because nine weeks seems like such a long time, or because it seems like we’ve been here way, way longer, but we’re leaning towards the former. Here’s our list of nine things we should know/have re-learned by now.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Tomorrow’s high is 55, with a low of 52, with an 80% chance of rain during the day and a 100% chance of rain at night. If anything could make midterm season (midterm semester?) worse, it’s the gloomy weather, but just use it as your excuse to treat yourself to coffee in the new Barker Café.
