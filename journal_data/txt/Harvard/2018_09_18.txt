After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mama. The nearly universal word for mother. A sweet collection of syllables thought to form many babies’ first word. It is also the core subject of HBO’s latest limited series “Sharp Objects,” brilliantly directed by Jean-Marc Vallée—of “Big Little Lies” fame—and adapted from Gillian Flynn’s novel of the same name. With its luscious cinematography, haunting story, and painful soundtrack, “Sharp Objects” delivers a stunning Southern Gothic that gives this loving word a much darker connotation.
The series opens with the return of Camille Preaker (Amy Adams), a St. Louis reporter, to her small hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri. She has come back after many years to write about the disappearance and the subsequent murder of two young girls, Anne Nash and Natalie Keene. Camille’s boss Frank Curry (Miguel Sandoval) hopes that this piece will be a breakthrough for Camille in terms of cultivating her writing and battling her inner demons.
Camille is a high-functioning alcoholic who has spent years receiving psychiatric help for self-harm. She bears scars all over her body, elaborately carved words embossed over her skin like ridges on paper. Coming back home means dealing with her narrow-minded neighbors and her dangerously uptight mother Adora Crellin (Patricia Clarkson) with whom she has a deeply fraught relationship. The murders of the little girls brings on an onslaught of distressing memories, none more painful than the death of Marian, her younger sister who died when they were both very young.
Camille launches herself into the work fully, interviewing suspicious parents, siblings, and witnesses relentlessly. Though she is refused any information by the town’s police chief Bill Vickery (Matt Craven), who is deep in her mother’s pockets, she befriends and begins a relationship with the sharp Kansas City detective Richard Willis (Chris Messina). Their leads, while strong, are intermingled with the macabre town folklore and Adora’s meddling.
“Sharp Objects” successfully exists in a world of its own because of its strange blend of horror, legend, and mystery. Surreal elements are easily mixed into reality, such as the show’s many hidden messages: on the dashboard of radio in the background, on the street signs, glinting against Camille’s skin—these serve as warnings and red flags, appearing for mere seconds before vanishing. These etchings are also the source from which each episode derives its title. These hidden messages are one of the many intricate details that demonstrate how well constructed the series is.
While the plot is quite riveting, for the most part it is characters and the actors who play them who anchor the storyline. Clarkson plays Adora, the town’s wealthy queen bee, deftly and carefully. It is hard not to feel the Flannery O’Connor’s aesthetic influence as we watch Adora float through her impeccable, gargantuan Victorian in her billowing muslin robe. She radiates a power and evil that are inherently tied to the ancestral home Camille has learned to hate while growing up.
Camille’s teenage half-sister Amma (Eliza Scanlen) is an anachronism flitting between different eras and personalities. At night Amma traipses around town on “Boogie Nights” rollerblades with her clique of mean, delinquent girls. They go smoking, drinking, and have illicit meetings with boys. Back at home, she’s a polished Tabitha Stevens equipped with hair ribbons and false innocence. She spends her time playing with her special dollhouse, a model of her own home. Adora watches her carefully with delight, her own personal little doll. Over the course of the series, we realize that Amma is much more complicated this. Her own long suffered abuse has not only split her into two people, it has shattered her entirely into an unstable mess of identities. Scanlen plays these shifts exquisitely, and as the series continues, it is alarming to see how imperceptible the changes become.
The episodes on the whole build up towards a larger storyline quite slowly, especially because the story is told through a combination of rapid flashbacks and stylistic shots of the show’s major motifs. One moment we are in the present day with Camille attending Natalie Keene’s funeral. In the next we are jolted to Marian’s funeral in the past, where we watch a young Camille rage over the lifeless, painted face of her beloved sister. We discover early on that time in the show is never quite linear, such as when we hear Marian speaking to an older Camille in the present. The blend and warp emphasizes the importance of the past not only for the sake of solving the mystery, but also for Camille’s ability to attain closure.
Adams is incredibly moving as Camille, capturing both the hard, guarded shell of her journalist side but also her pained and horrified frozen child within. With an unloving mother, a dead sister, a history of brutal sexual assault, and a ghost of a father, Camille has enough agony and loneliness to fill a lifetime. Adams treats this character with sensitivity, conveying Camille’s different sides through a real depth of tear-jerking emotion. Her performance is truly remarkable, encapsulating both the chaos and iron that make up this wounded woman.
Another triumph of this series is its portrayal of Wind Gap: a true tapestry of middle America. Wind Gap is not a quaint Southern town. It’s the kind of place where the phrase “bless your heart” really means “fuck you.” Episode Five of the series is particularly noteworthy because it gives the first suggestion that the sickness and evil so entrenched in the antagonists is passed down through the town’s polluted foundations and lineage: a modern day Thebes. “Closer” details the Crellin festivities on Calhoun day, a celebration of the town’s Confederate soldier founder, Zeke Calhoun. The main event of the party is a play acted by the local children centering on Calhoun’s teenage wife Millie who is raped and tortured by Yankee soldiers when she refuses to give up her husband. This is the show that the town’s members applaud with eagerness—little Amma as Millie being violated on stage as people cheer on her bravery and commitment to family. When presented with a scene like this, it becomes easy to see the show’s fascination with mothers and heritage.
Though “Closer” is generally more sickening than even the most graphic of the other episodes, Camille’s ironic explanations of the town history to an amused Richard makes it slightly more palatable. This episode in particular unveils a duplicity that will later prove crucial to the show’s ultimate reveal. As Camille explains, nobody would ever use the “C” word (Confederate) outright but its residents would nonetheless bear the flags silently. This is because they operate under a tacit, deeply ingrained set of rules which help to capture the general feeling of complacency and collusion that hovers over the shoulders of many of the characters. Everyone is a liar in Wind Gap.
Along with its incredible shots, the show’s soundtrack deserves quite a bit of praise. It includes an esoteric mix of jazz, Led Zeppelin, country, and mangled synths. The songs are not only the keys to uncovering Camille’s frame of mind, but also essential for creating the haunting atmosphere so characteristic of the show. In the penultimate episode, “Down in the Willow Garden,” a song about poisoning and murdering little girls, plays at the end while Amma and her father Alan gleefully dance and sing along to the gruesome lyrics. This is an eeriness you can’t get anywhere else.
With its incredible cast and storytelling, “Sharp Objects” is sure to be an awards darling. Of course, this is not the only reason why it should be watched. More than anything, “Sharp Objects” is a masterfully told story about trauma, recovery, and inheritable sickness. At times it can be difficult to follow Camille’s struggles: What other possible horrors could the show have in store for this woman? While it may be a far cry from uplifting and still leave its viewers with many questions at its very end, it is a necessary portrait of a broken family and viewers may applaud the show for finding it somewhere in its twisted heart to give Camille just a bit of much deserved and needed closure in the end.

“Explained,” the weekly informational Netflix show produced by Vox Media, is both nothing new and an interesting development in the ever more varied field of television. It is the big-budget brother of the short-form, informational, mini-documentaries that make up much of Vox’s YouTube presence, but the change in platform and production value makes “Explained” a very different animal from the majority of Vox’s output. With each episode running between 15 and 20 minutes, these are far from full-length documentaries. But with more runtime, “Explained” can handle bigger topics—the racial wealth gap, the stock market, and the female orgasm, for instance—and provide fuller coverage than the YouTube videos.
The purpose of an “Explained” episode is neatly captured by the title: Each one tries to download enough information on a hot topic for you to sound smart, or at least not asinine, at a party—all in about the time it takes for you to make and eat a sandwich. The choice of subjects aligns well with this attitude, and they tend to fall into three categories: things you’ve always wondered about (“Can We Live Forever?”, “Extraterrestrial Life,” “Why Diets Fail”), things you definitely should know about (“The World's Water Crisis,” “Why Women Are Paid Less,” “The Racial Wealth Gap"), and semi-opaque aspects of culture and technology (“Political Correctness,” “eSports,” “K–Pop”).
For the most part, Vox chooses their topics wisely. Only one episode—“Exclamation Mark (!)”—thus far has seemed fully trivial, giving an only somewhat engaging history of a minor piece of punctuation. The episode redeems itself somewhat by examining the gendered role the exclamation mark plays in workplace communication, but it still stands out as the only clearly lacking episode.
This is in large part because “Explained” does what it sets out to do almost flawlessly. The episodes feel longer than they are due to the sheer amount of information in them, but, impressively, are more refreshing than dull. The cast of (mostly) celebrity narrators range in quality—Kyle MacLachlan is charming even while informing you of the horrific effects of water shortages—but all serve amiably well. Stylistically, the show follows the modern, fairly banal standard for documentaries, but does it very slickly, with well-designed graphics and music that is catchy, but never dominant. The title sequence, specially designed for each episode, deserves a special mention for being able to pack in a huge amount of history, diversity of thought, and imagery related to the topic in a short amount of time. The best way to sum up the show is that it is cleanly and stylishly effective.
Besides its content, the most interesting aspect of “Explained” is just how different it feels from Vox’s YouTube content. More so than even the expanded budget, the change in platform dramatically affects the tenor of the show, granting it more legitimacy. “Explained” feels like something one could (and possibly should) seek out in an effort to be a more informed person, albeit with limited time. The Vox YouTube channel, as with nearly everything else on YouTube, has a thin veneer of guilty pleasure to it, something “Explained” has avoided. Vox may have shown the way forward for other media companies hoping to bridge the gap—one could imagine, say, the New York Times having its own Netflix show (it may be a few years before The Crimson gets one). “Explained” both creates a niche and fills it out nicely, and as more episodes come out every week, it may provide an interesting example of the future of televised news.

Although the subject of alcohol consumption is not unfamiliar for most college students, some might be surprised at the practice’s rich history. A new exhibit at the Harvard Art Museums reveals the intricate — and often surprising — history of drinking from the ancient world to the present.
The exhibit, titled “Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World: Feasting with Gods, Heroes, and Kings,” opened on Sept. 7 and will run until Jan. 8, 2019. The exhibit features nearly 60 drinking vessels and more than 10 paintings and reliefs collected from over 20 museums around the world. Although most objects in the exhibit are connected to drinking rites in the Mediterranean and Middle East from the fourth and fifth centuries B.C.E. to the fifth century C.E., the objects span nearly three millennia and four continents, ranging from Cameroonian drinking horns used in the early 20th Century to ancient Greek and Iranian vessels from 500 B.C.E.
Susanne Ebbinghaus, George M.A. Hanfmann Curator of Ancient Art at the Harvard Art Museums and Head of the Division of Asian and Mediterranean Art and a lecturer in the Classics Department, curated the exhibit. Ebbinghaus — who has been a curator at HAM since 2006 — said in an interview that the exhibit had been in the works for a number of years. Even before the roots of a formal exhibit were envisioned, Ebbinghaus said drinking vessels had been an academic interest of hers, given she had written her doctoral dissertation on vessels from the Achaemenid empire. She noted that the exhibit is the first of its kind.
“Not only has no one brought all these animal shaped vessels together, but also exhibitions with this wide a range are quite rare,” Ebbinghaus said.
In a lecture on opening night, an Anthropology Professor at the University of Chicago, Michael Dietler, pointed out that the physical similarities between the objects and anthropologists’ understanding of their uses suggest ornate drinking vessels were used across a number of cultures to promote bonding and social cohesion.
“People across the world use alcohol to create social relationships and mark identities,” he said. “These containers reflect the significance of the communal events where they were used.”
Steve Iskovitz, a Cambridge resident, said, “it was interesting to look at the historical context for drinking, especially because back then they took much more care, and now we drink out of plastic cups and glasses much of the time.”
The exhibit highlighted vessels used for celebratory and often rowdy drinking occasions, a fact that Ebbinghaus emphasized in her initial remarks on opening night. She noted that the use of the rhyton—an ancient drinking vessel held by the user to pour water into the mouth—often served as a comical act intended to rouse onlookers at the party. The exhibit boasts a number of vessels that mimic the shape of the snout of an animal such as a bull or a donkey, or the beak of an eagle. These objects may have been constructed so that the user of the vessel took on the appearance of a donkey, for instance, which symbolized aggression and raucousness in ancient Greek lore.
Although the objects span many thousands of years across cultures, empires, and nations, it is not difficult to imagine the myriad uses for many of these objects. As a result, the exhibit seems to not only attempt to explicate the importance of drinking as a ritual in human history, but it also seems to draw attention to the ways in which many aspects of daily life normally taken for granted can have deep cultural significance.
“Every vessel has a story to tell,” Ebbinghaus said. “We may not know the story but we can imagine it, and this is what this exhibit attempts to do.”

“You laugh / Because I’m poor and black and funny.” These words open A.R.T.’s new show “The Black Clown,” a musical and dramatic adaptation of Langston Hughes’ poem of the same name. Though written in 1931, its verses are still bound to send chills down one's spine and induce an intense discomfort that stems from the truth and irony that characterizes both the entire poem and the performance.
“The Black Clown” is intended by its adaptors to be spoken by a “pure-blooded Negro in the white suit and hat of a clown” and accompanied by a piano or an orchestra. A.R.T.’s new show is beautifully adapted by Harvard College alumnae bass-baritone Davóne J. Tines ’09 and composer Michael L. Schachter ’09. Backed by an incredibly talented all-black cast, their new production exquisitely brings to life a rich musical legacy of jazz, gospel, opera, and spirituality.
Every stanza of the poem is broken up into various parts, each with different tones and music/dance styles. The first stanza makes up the opening dance and song. “You Laugh” begins with the titular Black Clown (Davóne Tines) speaking the first line of the poem into a standing microphone at the center of the stage. He is in period dres s— high-waisted pants and suspenders. The Black Clown unabashedly and simply looks straight out at the audience as he speaks. Eventually his speech turns into singing, which characterizes the entire performance of the poem — the focus is less about recitation and more about the musical and visual performance. Tines’ singing is dark and rich like syrup. He possesses an incredible control over his voice, imbuing each note with vibrato and emotion as he tells us about the pain, hatred, scorn, and complacency that makes up the life of a black man. His delivery is all the more powerful because the reports of being “pushed own” and the constant “white spit” in his face sadly do not feel at all like anachronisms.
While “You Laugh” is comprises of just the Black Clown and a female ensemble member, who joins him in a call-and-response fashion, over the course of the other numbers the rest of the ensemble eventually all gather on stage. They break out into wild dancing, paired with drums, tap dancing, and 1950s style swing dancing in “Strike Up the Music.” Here, ensemble member Amber Pickens puts on a particularly beautiful show of energy and athleticism in the form of pirouettes and slides into splits at double time, almost as if possessed.
For the most part, the stage is constrained by several walls of tarp. These are eventually replaced by white screened panels on wheels, behind which the cast dances during “Three Hundred Years,” another section derived from one of the stanzas, depicting slavery. The audience never actually sees any of the actual cast members. Instead, slinky shadows shrink and swell eerily across the screens as they dance. The shadows speak to the anonymity of slavery, and even though they sing in unison, one cannot help but distinguish between some of the individual voices during a particularly sorrowful rendition of “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.”
Choreographer Chanel DaSilva should be praised for the diverse, beautiful, lively dance — tapping heavily into jazz and swing for most of the styles. The choreography is incredibly important for setting the tone of the words, sometimes its mood deliberately clashing with the ironic words for dramatic effect. This was evident during the performance of “Freedom!” The positive and optimistic lines about emancipation were steeped in irony, underscored by the gleeful dancing and the appearance of Abraham Lincoln on clunky stilts lording above the rest of the cast oafishly. No moment was more ironic that when ensemble members began to skip rope joyfully with a giant noose. Though perhaps the most disquieting moment, it is precisely this ability to provoke and disturb which made the performance so fantastic.
Of course, the show’s music is its true star. Schachter does an excellent job of bringing to life traditionally black forms of music in a kind of progression, for example, with New Orleans jazz eventually blending into gospel and blues seamlessly. The orchestra stuns with their energetic playing, driving the performance forward. During the more quiet numbers, usually those consisting of just the keyboard (Jaret Landon and Bethany Aiken), the orchestra’s absence is noted, as it makes the stage feel almost empty.
In the wake of “Hamilton,” where history is being depicted through relatively more modern forms of music, “The Black Clown” stands alone in the way it upholds and revamps older styles of music. It pays tribute to a history of oppression and injustice in a more traditional way, but that does not make it any less remarkable. Its hauntingly beautiful voices rage and cheer across the stage showing a whole spectrum of emotions. This nuanced composition has so many elements incorporated, each so thoughtfully put together that it becomes difficult to distinguish which is the best. It is truly a heartbreaking performance, yet so delightful the tears cannot help but accompany a smile.

When “Parks and Rec,” sleeping, and the really cool plant walls in the Smith Campus Center don’t feel fun anymore, it’s time to try something new. Luckily, music video producers seem to know that school is back, and they’re here to help. In the past few weeks, we’ve had two additions to a genre that makes for prime escapism. That’s right: We now have two new music videos styled like TV shows from Disney Channel.
First there’s “Thunderclouds,” a real trip from LSD (Labrinth, Sia, and Diplo) where Maddie Ziegler makes friends with—of course—a thundercloud. And in Childish Gambino’s “Feels Like Summer,” animated pop culture heroes wander around the suburbs grilling burgers and getting into fights. Both of them present an ideal chance to ignore your responsibilities and watch a video that could be aired on Cartoon Network. If you’re not convinced yet, here’s why they’re both great:
1. The actual music
Ok, so LSD and Childish Gambino come from very different genres, and this isn’t a music review. But I dare you to listen to either video and not feel immediately relaxed. “Feels Like Summer” doesn’t actually feel like summer at all: It feels like right now, late August and early September. It is resigned, slightly regretful, and a static acknowledgement of how its stasis will soon give way to fall. In other words, it’s kind of a bop.
“Thunderclouds” relies on a weirder strategy. I don’t know who decided to pair a song about a couple in a struggling relationship with a video about LSD traveling on a bus through the sky. Why does it all come together in the “Thunderclouds” video? I couldn’t tell you, but it probably helps that Sia has written so extensively for actual movies. Also, she does a lot of that scream-sing thing she’s so good at.
2. The aesthetics
Both of these videos are absolutely stunning. “Thunderclouds” has an edge here — I would 100 percent live in the bus that LSD takes through the sky. I also can’t wait to see someone dressed up like Maddie-Ziegler-as-Amelia-Earhart for Halloween this year, which I fully expect will happen.
But “Feels Like Summer” holds its own aesthetically. It strikes just the right balance between making its avatars identifiable and ambiguous, so now you, too, can spend hours deliberating on whether Gambino pays homage to the late rapper XXXTentacion through a cup of melting ice cream, the colors of which reflect the rapper’s own hair colors. What more could you ask of a music video?
3. The political implications
Here Childish Gambino has the upper hand, mostly because “Feels Like Summer” is so weird. Why is Michelle Obama comforting Kanye West while he’s wearing a MAGA hat? Is Childish Gambino actually talking about global warming when he references “air that kill the bees that we depend upon”? Why is Rihanna placed on the same playing field as Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson, but Beyoncé is in a different part of the video?
“Thunderclouds,” on the other hand, affirms friendships across the human/thundercloud divide, so there’s that.
4. The spinoff possibilities
Both “Thunderclouds” and “Feels Like Summer” are kind of ambiguous — but that’s great, procrastination-wise! It means that someone could, hypothetically, spend a long time making up fictional narratives that match the groups’ visuals. Is Diplo supposed to be Maddie Ziegler’s dad? How long are they gonna be on that bus? What would it be like if Frank Ocean and Oprah actually lived on the same street?
In conclusion, I would watch a full-length movie by LSD or Childish Gambino without hesitation. Hopefully, other artists will take note and add to the cartoon-music-video genre. I’ve seen enough music videos about sad, live-action relationships. I need more thunderclouds and cartoons of Azealia Banks. After all, in these troubling times, rewatching the “Harry Potter” movies can only get you so far — and LSD and Childish Gambino, thank god, are here to help.

I can’t stay silent anymore. “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” is an awful movie. It was painful to watch, and now the pain continues every day that I am forced to see meme after meme of Peter Kavinsky and his stupid yogurt. Am I a cheerless hag who won’t let anyone enjoy things, not even Noah Centineo? Yes. Am I a “race traitor”? If failing to fawn over this expired chicken salad of a Netflix Original makes me one, then yes, a resounding yes.
For those of you who have forgotten the details of a very forgettable film, “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” goes something like this: Lara Jean Covey (pronounced “COVE-ee” or “CUH-vee” — no one in the movie seems to be sure), a lonely teen with a penchant for mass-market erotica, finds herself friendless when her sister Margot leaves for college. One of Lara Jean’s few hobbies is writing — but never sending — love letters to boys she likes. So Kitty, her younger sister, decides to get the plot moving by mailing these letters to their addressees, including Peter Kavinsky, who was recently dumped by Lara Jean’s Regina George-esque ex-friend Gen, and Josh Sanderson, Margot’s ex-boyfriend. When Peter and Josh confront Lara Jean about the letters, she decides to confuse Josh by mounting and forcibly kissing Peter in one of the most lighthearted scenes of sexual assault I’ve ever seen. Peter decides to reject Lara Jean’s advances by hitting on her. He eventually suggests that Lara Jean pretend to be his girlfriend so that Gen will be jealous and Josh will forget about the letter he received. Lara Jean accepts this proposal, and — who’d a thunk! — she and Peter begin to fall for each other.
I’m not going to bash “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” for its hokey premise because the problem isn’t that it’s a cheesy rom-com. The problem is that it’s an agonizingly bad rom-com — tomato-throwing bad, let’s-power-through-the-next-hour bad.
First of all, why is it never addressed that Peter Kavinsky is a crappy dude? I’m all for villains, antiheroes, and morally ambiguous characters, but why does the movie position Peter as an uncomplicated romantic hero if he’s so clearly a jerk? Peter, you’re not supposed to have sleepovers with Gen if you’re dating someone else. It doesn’t matter that you kept it in your pants. And if you’ve always known that Gen is a meanie and you kept silent because you were dating her, that puts you at Melania levels of complicity. If I were more generous, I would interpret Peter’s unacknowledged assholery as a subtle indictment of the way passably attractive straight white men are rarely punished for their transgressions, but I am not that generous. This movie wants us to think that Peter Kavinsky is a dream boyfriend because he can buy Yakult and recognize the blatant racism in “Sixteen Candles.” I’m not here for it.
Second of all, what’s up with the casting in this movie? Peter Kavinsky looks like the Pokemon evolution of Josh Sanderson. And why are the teenage characters so consistently played by adult actors? Is it labor laws? A desire to avoid the ickiness of adult viewers fawning over underage actors? A need to draw in viewers with actors who are heartthrob material (i.e. Noah Centineo) and therefore not stricken by the ineluctable ugliness of mid-adolescence? I just don’t understand why movie teenagers can’t look like real teenagers.
Third of all, why is every interaction between Peter and Lara Jean so cringey? There’s one particularly bad scene in which Peter and Lara Jean discuss her dead mother and his absent father and bond through mutual vulnerability and whatnot. This may seem innocuous enough, but Noah Centineo and Lana Condor (who play Peter and Lara Jean, respectively) really muck up an already shoddily written scene with their middle school play-tier acting. I get it, guys, pauses can be pregnant with meaning! They can indicate lots of things, like deep thought, emotional turmoil, and an extremely limited arsenal of acting techniques. I’m no actor myself, but surely there are better ways to show that a character is revealing something big and painful than to stare slightly into space, shake one’s head slowly, and insert a beat between every other clause.
Fourth of all — and I might lose some of you here — I could not stand this movie’s treatment of Lara Jean’s mother. An hour and 20 minutes in, there’s a scene in which Lara Jean and her father hang out in a diner and talk about what a cool and quirky gal the late Mrs. Covey was. She played songs on repeat and danced in diners! What an absolute riot! Turns out that if you’re a screenwriter and you want to show that a woman has a personality, you needn’t deign to write her one: Simply have a male character describe a random handful of her idiosyncrasies and you’re all set! If we were to employ a feminist postcolonial reading of this film, we might say that Mrs. Covey is a representation of the silenced subaltern woman, and that her portrayal in the movie reifies and reproduces the subjugation of such women. Our knowledge of her is mediated largely through the perspective of Dr. Covey; that Dr. Covey’s specialty is gynecology (a practice that undoubtedly helps women but is also marred by a continuing history of sexual abuse and male control of female bodies) also merits further exploration. I’m not saying Lara Jean shouldn’t have had a dead mother — I just wish the film’s representation of Mrs. Covey weren’t so hollow and filtered so substantially through Dr. Covey’s perspective alone.
I was going to indulge my cruelty with a fifth of all and a sixth of all, but I think I’ve made my point clear. Let us accept that “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” is a bad movie so that finally, finally, we — and all the interns at Esquire — can move on with our lives.

The audience members at Friday, Sept. 7’s First Aid Kit concert were more buttoned-up than the throngs that sometimes fill Boston’s Blue Hills Bank Pavilion. The crowd filed into the theater decked out in tasteful scarves, ready to hear a band that matched their cleanliness — and like its audience, First Aid Kit avoided an overly saccharine performance primarily thanks to their genuine enthusiasm.
First Aid Kit, a band comprised of Swedish sisters Klara and Johanna Soderberg,is an indie-folk group that leans heavily on earnestness. After experiencing some burnout following their 2014 album “Stay Gold,” the sisters took a lengthy break. But between January’s breakup album “Ruins” and their current tour, First Aid Kit has fully reclaimed their acoustic guitars and gingham dresses. If they are still experiencing the exhaustion they reported in 2015, Friday’s concert made it impossible to tell.
First Aid Kit took the stage after opener Julia Jacklin, who set the tone for the night with a sweet, unaffected setlist. Jacklin skews more towards indie pop than First Aid Kit’s folksiness. With a slight genre shift, her vocal style would fit in on a track written for Alessia Cara. First Aid Kit’s aesthetic, however, is entirely its own. The sisters’ style is a kind of Swedish Americana kitsch — there were the gingham dresses, of course, and the trombone accompaniment, and the acoustic instrument selections. The background displays, however, were the single best example of First Aid Kit’s sentimentality. Styled like a Looney Tunes sketch from the ’50s, the animations crossed the screen in droves: Route 66 memorabilia backed “It’s a Shame,” a stained-glass sun rose behind “Stay Gold,” and a pack of wolves supported (naturally) “Wolf.” Two separate songs, “Master Pretender” and “Emmylou,” were set against a backdrop of black-and-white photos of the band.
The sisters themselves were physically static on stage, so the sets did most of the visual work. The animations had sufficient flair, however, so the performers’ lack of motion seemed both natural and fluid. If there had been a drop of cynicism throughout the performance, First Aid Kit would be easy to rip apart — but there wasn’t, and so it isn’t. Earnestness, after all, is First Aid Kit’s brand. They lie somewhere in between indie and country, twangy without being twee, showcasing their sisterhood and their sweetness without ever fully commercializing it.
The show became lackluster only when the band tried to escape these folksy parameters. A generic protest song for the #MeToo movement, for example, fell slightly flat: While it was topically powerful, the song fell outside of the band’s genre, and it showed. Angry protest just isn’t what First Aid Kit is about. Their audience clapped politely for the sisters’ anger, but they seemed happiest when the songs tended towards the bittersweet — when the listeners could sway back and forth in their ballet flats, silently mouthing all of the words.
The Soderberg sisters are powerful singers whose ranges are just as towering live as they are on recordings. They nail dissonant harmonies with so much confidence that the clashes sound obvious. They are talented enough that critics have been suggesting they’ll blow up for years — but First Aid Kit has been resolutely itself for long enough now that traditional mega-fame may never come. This isn’t a tragedy. It means that First Aid Kit can continue to sing folk songs exclusively to an audience that wants to hear them. This is a band that, with very few missteps, knows who it is. And for audience members who like the group’s brand of nostalgic country, First Aid Kit’s enthusiasm makes for a live performance that is both engaging and endlessly skillful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last we heard from Noname, at the end of her 2016 mixtape “Telefone,” she left us in the waning light of a Chicago sunset with a description of her own funeral on our minds and the jazzy hum of an outro in our ears. Two years later, on her debut album “Room 25,” she picks up where she left off and fills us in on everything we missed in the interim. On “Telefone” she imagines her funeral, saying “Kanye did the eulogy,” but in the first lines of her studio debut she says “Maybe this the album you listen to in your car / When you’re driving home late at night / Really questioning every god, religion, Kanye, bitches.” Where “Telefone” is a collection of familiar and nostalgic vignettes of childhood and of home, “Room 25” zeroes in on Noname’s individual experiences and increasing distance from home and from her past, amounting to what feels like a series of diary entries that — with opener “Self” and closer “No Name”— starts and ends with the artist herself.
The past two years were eventful ones for Noname. She toured the country, moved from her beloved Chicago to L.A., and, according to a recent interview with Fader, had sex for the first time. She flaunts one of these shifts, her newfound sexuality, in “Self.” She says, in what will no doubt become an iconic line, “Fucked your rapper homie, now his ass is making better music / My pussy teachin’ ninth-grade English / My pussy wrote a thesis on colonialism in conversation with a marginal system.” With this new physical intimacy comes, inevitably, its breakdown, a topic she tackles in “Window.” Set to string instruments and hollow percussion, she raps the melancholic lines “I bought you Game 5 tickets, made my pussy the sequel / So you really don’t think about me? / And you really don’t miss me?” On paper, the words read as though they are bitter. But in Noname’s soft monotone they are lonely, longing, and internalized.
Lyrical complexity is not a reach for Noname. She strikes a delicate balance between self-reflection and social commentary, at times in the same song. In “Blaxploitation,” she employs a ‘70s sound and samples of dialogue from from track’s titular genre to riff on harmful stereotypes, gentrification, and political exploitation. “Prayer Song” begins with Noname  disconnected in Inglewood, California saying “LA be bright but still a dark city / So come get your happy and your new titties.” By the song’s end, Noname raps a full verse from the perspective of a police officer to comment on police brutality, verbalizing a toxic, masculine desire for power and control in lines like “Ain’t no police locking up these n----- better than me / And my wife think I look like a man, I feel manly.” A sharp snare drum gives the final verse a feeling of increasing anxiety and terror.
In “Room 25,” Noname builds on her jazz band feel. Tracks “Blaxploitation” and “Montego Bae,” feature movie-soundtrack-style funk and reggae sounds, respectively, while tracks “Window” and “Don’t Forget About Me” include background compositions by string instruments. Alternating xylophone, snaps, and snare drum give emotional depth to percussion lines. Each instrument, beat, and vocal sounds so choreographed that, together, they create the expectation that Noname will speak at the same rhythm. Instead, her voice floats over the music, weaving in and out of the rhythm in a way that seems to make the music bend to her will.
After an album’s worth of songs owning her identity, Noname talks about herself almost like she’s hiding. In the closing track “No Name” she explains herself, and her moniker, in the lines, “‘Cause when we walk into heaven, nobody’s name gon’ exist.” Maybe that’s true, but by putting her life front and center on “Room 25,” Noname makes a name for herself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gone are the days of "Harvard Time." Students, long accustomed to a seven-minute grace period before the start of classes and meetings, must now adapt to a schedule which expects them to show up promptly on time. For the start of the 2018-19 academic year, the College has implemented a new schedule involving 75-minute blocks with 15-minute passing periods between them. The move was made with an eye towards facilitating movement between classes on the existing campus and those held in the new School of Engineering and Applied Science’s Allston campus, which is slated to open in 2020.
While we applaud the University’s decision to introduce a 15-minute passing time between blocks so that future undergraduates pursuing STEM fields are not penalized for long commutes from Allston, the scheduling changes otherwise have turned out to be a nightmare for students. While any change to the scheduling system would have of course caused some transitional struggles, the problems with the new schedule are not limited to simple growing pains.
One prominent drawback of the schedule is that by lengthening class blocks, there is a necessary reduction in the number of timeslots in which courses are offered. This change increases the likelihood of scheduling conflicts, making it increasingly difficult for students to enroll in the classes they would prefer, or even classes that could help them decide between concentrations. Sectioning has also been affected. Some students are forced to take sections that are either early in the morning, late in the afternoon, or at times that, when taken with the rest of their coursework, can force them to miss the opportunity for lunch or dinner in a dining hall.
In that vein, arguably the most prominent consequence of the schedule change is its detrimental effects on meal time, which we consider detrimental to student life and an indicator of a poorly thought-out policy. When students have classes in the Yard at noon and 1:30 p.m., fifteen minutes is not enough to go to a dining hall for lunch. Though FlyBy, Harvard University Dining Services’s station for upperclassmen to grab a bagged meal, has always served as an option for students on days in which their schedule is particularly tight, the 15-minute blocks in between back-to-back classes does not allow enough time for transit from class, food acquisition, and transit to the following class. This issue could be further complicated as more students decide to use FlyBy in response to the scheduling change.
Our schedule should combine rigorous academic life with a healthy lifestyle. Forcing students to choose between fasting and spending what little disposable income they have on meals is a blatant failure to live up to that ideal. To remedy this egregious oversight, we urge Harvard to consider revising HUDS and FlyBy schedules to make them more compatible with the new class schedule.
For students living in the Quad, the new schedule, with rigid starting times, poses an additional logistical problems in the transportation sphere. Even minor delays in the shuttle service can translate into students arriving late to class. This problem will become especially pertinent in the winter months when opting to ride the shuttle is undoubtedly more favorable than trekking through the snow to the Yard. The seven-minute flex-time allotted to students in the Harvard time system allowed for students to use the shuttle without missing important content.
Even aside from the detriments of the schedule in daily life, more troubling still is the fact that current students were not more widely consulted during the process of changing the institutional rhythm around which their lives are built. Many of the logistical difficulties imposed by the new schedule may have been avoided if students were polled beforehand. We urge administrators considering new proposals, such as one to eliminate shopping week, to solicit student input. Rather than forcibly instituting major new scheduling changes and expecting students to adapt, Harvard should — to a greater degree — take into account student opinion on whether the policy would benefit or harm their academic experience.
In the future, we hope that Harvard will consult the student body through poll or similar means before implementing policies that cause ripples of logistical challenges among the student population. We also urge Harvard to align its other services with the demands of the new schedule to allay the logistical nightmares students face on a daily basis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One day in my middle school art class, everyone was handed a box of markers and the printout of a circle divided into six segments. We were told to color the segments carefully in order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. The rainbow we could linearly recite since kindergarten suddenly bent into an infinite loop. And so we learned the color wheel.
The color wheel neatly illustrates the concept of complementary colors — pairs of colors positioned on opposite sides of the circle. When wedged side by side, these pairs generate a strange and dramatic effect. They become brighter, almost swimming, bursting against sharp borders that are magnets for the gaze. Red and green, orange and blue, yellow and purple. I started to see pairs everywhere — advertisements, art, company logos, book covers. Pop art like Andy Warhol’s Madonna paintings began to make sense, with bold swathes of saturated color creating a tug-of-war for the eyes. Christmas decorations owe their allure to the striking combination of red and green. And in the natural world, the most spellbinding sunsets flaunt a vivid contrast between yellow and purple, orange and blue.
This remained an awesome revelation for several years, until I started learning about light in high school science class. The physics behind color radically upended my understanding of the color wheel: Visible light is merely a snippet of wavelengths within an immense continuum of electromagnetic radiation. So why on Earth are complementary colors special? It should not be possible, after all, to bend this subset of wavelengths into an infinite loop. From red to purple, the corresponding color wavelengths decrease smoothly. But it makes no sense that purple should be able to smoothly blend back into red, since at some point the wavelengths would have to jump from low to high. Thus, complementary colors, defined as opposites on the color wheel, seemed completely arbitrary.
Naturally, I reconciled this conflict by deciding that art and science were simply irreconcilable. It was an easy conclusion to reach. My science classes had never addressed anything artistic. And my art classes had never dealt with scientific concepts. I believed that, although I would always love art, my decision to pursue neuroscience made art separate and secondary to my true studies. Since the two disciplines never overlapped in my academic schedule, it seemed plausible that they were not meant to overlap at all. The science behind visible light didn’t have to explain the color wheel because science and art could exist in two disparate and contradictory worlds.
But years later, in a neuroscience lecture on color vision at Harvard, these two worlds came crashing back together. Although I’d deemed the visible light spectrum and the color wheel irreconcilable, I’d neglected the major link between them: the brain. After all, wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are meaningless until the brain translates them into color. And it turns out the neurons responsible for this don’t merely identify wavelengths color by color. Instead, some get excited when they see one specific color (like red) and inhibited when they see another (like green), generating the illusion of pairs of opposite colors. And others get excited when one color (like red) dominates a center point, at the same time as its opposite color (like green) dominates the surrounding area. As a result, these respond most strongly to high contrast edges between two complementary colors.
Thus it’s the brain that turns science into art, and art back into science. A linear continuum of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation gets fed into our minds, where it’s converted into a rainbow of colors, then psychologically bent into an infinite loop of opposites, which we learn to represent in middle school art class as the color wheel. Physics and neuroscience explain why art is so compelling: The cells in our brains are literally electrified by certain combinations of color. And art, in turn, gives significance to the blunt facts of biology: The arresting emotions that color can elicit are a testament to the power of these neural processes.
My science classes may have never addressed anything artistic, and my art classes may have never dealt with scientific concepts, but maybe they should have. Harvard has successfully created other spaces to study the intersection of the humanities, STEM, and social sciences, like History of Science, Global Health and Health Policy, and the digital humanities. But despite this push for interdisciplinarity at Harvard and in academia in general, it’s still so rare to find classes, much less concentrations, that combine (or even mention a combination of) art and science. For most non-artists, art is only available as a hobby, an elective, or a secondary field at best. It’s one of the greatest exceptions to the rule of interdisciplinarity, divided from science in the course catalog, relegated to our spare time. But this siloed mindset about art leads to countless missed opportunities, for art and science have never been two opposite worlds. Instead, they’re a continuum of concepts that blend into each other on loop. And our understanding of the world is deepened when we not only understand art and science in their own rights, but also understand how, when seen together, they create a more meaningful whole.

As a Harvard student, I am part of Harvard’s second consecutive majority nonwhite admitted class, and greatly appreciate the diversity of my friends, peers, and teachers. I believe that a multicultural Harvard broadens its students’ perspectives and results in alumni who are better prepared for life and leadership in an increasingly diverse America. However, all of my learning about Harvard students’ cultures and ways of life has occurred outside the classroom — Harvard currently offers 50 concentrations, of which only African and African American Studies explicitly allows for the study of ethnic experience in the United States. In a rapidly changing America, it is crucial that Harvard gives its students the opportunity to learn about the ways in which the experiences of their peers intersect and interact in an academic space — it is time for Harvard to offer a concentration in ethnic studies.
A concentration in ethnic studies would offer departmental support and invaluable resources for students to better understand the diverse experiences of their fellow citizens and classmates and would make them better leaders for tomorrow’s America. While there is debate over the precise definition of ethnic studies, the field generally concerns the study of the intersection of ethnic experiences. In today’s America, understanding these cultural mixings is fundamental to understanding American culture as a whole — as debates rage over who is entitled to sell ethnic cuisine, wear culturally significant attire, or even identify as a member of a given race, the dialogue surrounding these issues and the conclusions that this nation comes to will inevitably be shaped by academia. Consider the steps being taken by Harvard’s academic rivals: Yale offers a major in Ethnicity, Rights, and Migration, and has established a center dedicated for Ethnic Studies work, Stanford offers a major in Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity, Columbia offers an Ethnicity and Race Studies major — the list goes on. By not offering an ethnic studies concentration, Harvard will inevitably cost itself faculty and students passionate about the field and lag more and more in the national conversation.
While Harvard recently added a track in ethnic studies under the History and Literature concentration last year and offers the Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights secondary track, these measures fall far short of the previously mentioned offerings of other comparable educational institutions and do not achieve nearly as much as a full department would. Without full, tenured positions in ethnic studies, the most qualified faculty in the field would necessarily sacrifice both compensation and security to come to Harvard. A lack of quality faculty means a shortage of classes and an inability to serve students who have an interest in taking ethnic studies classes or those who are interested in pursuing the concentration. Neither a specialized track under a concentration nor the existence of a comparable secondary addresses these infrastructural issues that currently stand in the way of students who are interested in ethnic studies.
The fight for ethnic studies at Harvard is not a new one — students have been trying for more than 40 years to make ethnic studies a reality at Harvard. However, there has never been a more pressing need for thoughtful conversations about ethnic studies. Most Americans agree that racism is still a major problem, but our politics and dialogue are becoming increasingly polarized. As a result, the question remains — what can Harvard students do to make ethnic studies at Harvard a reality? The options are many — support or join one of the many organizations on campus in dialogue with campus officials to make ethnic studies a full concentration or at least ensure that ethnic studies are a priority at Harvard. Groups like Harvard TAPAS work to bring qualified faculty to campus and offer educational programming. Taking ethnic studies classes also attests to the value and necessity of qualified faculty; supporting ethnic studies need not mean dedicating an entire academic career to the field. At a school with as many intelligent minds and vast resources such as Harvard, the potential advancements in ethnic studies are nearly limitless. All that remains is for that potential to be made a possibility.

Students will find more than coffee shops and comfortable orange chairs in the newly renovated Smith Campus Center this fall — some parts of University Health Services are moving into renovated digs, according to an email from UHS director Paul J. Barreira to students Monday.
As announced in the summer, HUHS 24/7 Urgent Care will now be offered in the Smith Campus Center, instead of its temporary location at Pound Hall on the Law School Campus. According to Barreira, this relocation has not caused a significant increase in use of the urgent care services, though he noted that students are likely “happier” with the new location.
Counseling and Mental Health Services reopened this semester in a “completely renovated new space” on the 4th floor of the Smith Campus Center, Barreira wrote. CAMHS will continue providing outpatient care for mental health concerns ranging from depression to crisis management, without a copay charge.
Additionally, CAMHS will continue with its Let’s Talk drop-in program, as well as online group mental health workshops, a program first launched last year. Barreira wrote that this program, called iHope, will introduce new workshop topics for this year and will continue to offer programs during evenings and weekends.
Last spring, CAMHS created two new positions, an Internal Case Coordinator and a Community Referral Coordinator, with the intention of enhancing therapy efficiency.
Barreira also informed students of personnel changes in the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, which provides confidential support to students.
In June, OSAPR was joined by a new Director Pierre Berastaín Ojeda ’10, who, according to Barreira, will oversee “advocacy, education, prevention services, and supporting coordination within OSAPR and throughout the University to address the needs of people who have experienced gender-based violence or interpersonal harm.”

Before the University embarks on a search for a new Assistant Dean for Public Service, administrators are conducting an internal assessment on the state of public service at the College.
Former Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Public Service Gene A. Corbin departed in May after six years in the position.
Sheila Thimba, the dean for administration and finance and acting interim dean for public service, said she was tasked with evaluating the current state of public service at the College, before the search for Corbin's replacement commences.
“We haven’t searched for a public service dean in more than a decade,” Thimba said. “So in part what we need to do is revise the position description to meet current needs.”
Thimba, who said she has been working on a report over the summer, said one factor under consideration is the desire for more coordination and “a greater sense of shared mission” among the many public service offices at the College.
“We talk about educating citizens and citizen-leaders,” Thimba said. “And I think we feel like this role is critical to building up what we mean when we say that.”
The potential changes are guided by the mission of the Seamless Service Pathways Process, a new College initiative which aims to strengthen relations between campus public service offices and provide students with a more coherent public service experience.
While Thimba said the College already provides a number of resources for public service-interested students, the assessment has highlighted areas of improvement.
“There are initiatives in public service that we haven’t had a lot of participation in,” Thimba said. “So I think that once we have a sense of that…I think we’ll be looking to likely expand what we mean when we say ‘public service,’ and what kinds of initiatives fit under this umbrella.”
Continuing reviews and planning will be done in the coming months, Thimba said, as administrators take in feedback from students and explore how they want the College to move forward in public service.
“It’s unlikely that we would start a search before November,” Thimba said.
In an emailed statement provided by Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote that he and Thimba have consulted “directly with members of the FAS Standing Committee for Public Service, the National Advisory Board for Public Service, the PBHA Board of Directors, and other partners on public service on how the College can continue to best support students’ academic and public service experiences.”
“We will continue to provide strong support for PBH and its student organizations in this interim time, and we will share details of our next steps when available,” he wrote.

For the first time, Harvard College required incoming freshmen to complete an online training module prior to their arrival on campus about sleeping habits and their effects on other areas of life.
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 and Harvard Medical School professor Charles A. Czeisler ’74 notified students in August of the mandatory module.
“Sleep duration, timing, and quality are especially important for young adults, who are most impacted by the adverse effects of sleep deficiency," their message read.
According to the module’s description, students explore “the intersections of sleep and various areas critical for a successful college experience, namely academic performance, athletics, mental and physical health, and social relationships.”
HMS faculty prepared the College’s module, utilizing a sleep-education program co-designed by Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s Sleep Health Institute and Healthy Hours. This content was added to the load of online modules, including alcohol education program Harvard Proof, that are required for incoming freshmen.
The new sleep training requirement stems from the work of Raymond So ’21, a sleep education advocate who took a freshman seminar with Czeisler last year entitled "Time for Sleep."
So described his own sleeping habits in high school as “atrocious,” but much of that changed after taking Czeisler’s freshman seminar.
“Taking his class really opened my eyes to all the clinical implications of sleep, and that inspired me to change my life,” So said. “I’m hoping through this initiative that we’ll be able to reach more students, because I’m sure, especially at such an institution with a lot of academic pressures and opportunities, that a lot of people experience the same sleep issues that I had.”
Lauren Tucker ’22 said she wsa initially skeptical of the module.
“I thought a 40-minute video on sleep was a little bit excessive. Like, how much could they really say?” she said. “But in my three weeks of being here I’m learning the value of sleep,”
“Everyone constantly talks about, ‘Ugh, I should try to get eight hours, I should try to get eight hours’, so it’s definitely like something in the back of my mind, something to aspire to," she added.
Others spoke less highly of the module's effects.
“I feel like the sleep module was a good attempt to help motivate students to try to get good sleep in college,” Amechi Egbunike ’22 said. “But, it was still pretty meaningless in a way, because students still end up staying up multiple hours late, usually in Lamont, trying to do their work, and it just backfires overall and ruins their sleep schedule.”
So explained that the late-night work scramble is one of the very things that the module attempts to combat in students’ thought processes.
“Especially on a college campus like Harvard, we tend to think that other things, such as academics, social life, and extracurriculars, have to come first,” So said. “One thing I want to emphasize, and what Sleep 101 emphasizes, is that if you do prioritize sleep first, you can excel in all the three other areas, as opposed to sleep taking away from those.”
As for So’s own sleeping schedule, he says that it has improved significantly since high school.
“Obviously, being at college, with everything, it’s impossible to maintain a perfect sleeping schedule. But I’m more aware, and when I do start to drift away from an optimal schedule, I’m more likely to tell myself, like, ‘no’, and make sure I’m back on track the next day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College mandated for the first time this year that undergraduates complete an online sexual harassment training, or else face consequences. Failure to complete the module, College administrators warned over the summer, would result in students being barred from enrolling in classes.
The hardline approach seems to have worked. Every degree-seeking College student enrolled for the fall term has completed the training, according to the College’s Title IX Coordinator Emily J. Miller.
The move comes after years of student activism — and at least one University-wide report — recommending mandatory training around sexual harassment prevention and response. Previously, students did not face repercussions for failing to complete trainings, even if those trainings were labeled as mandatory.
This year, completion of the online training triggered the removal of a hold on course enrollment similar to those for adviser approval or finishing the College’s semesterly check-in process.
The training consisted of an online module that explained the University’s Title IX policy, procedures, and resources. Title IX, an anti-sex discrimination law, underpins the school’s approach to sexual harassment. The training also discussed gender-based harassment. It presented a number of scenarios in which College students might find themselves needing to respond to instances of harassment.
As of the Sept. 12 course enrollment deadline, there were a few students who had not yet completed the newly-designed training, Miller said. Those students were not able to complete their enrollment until they finished the web-based module or an in-person training session either in a group or individually. As of Monday, though, Miller said all students have successfully completed some version of the training.
Miller wrote in an email that this year’s 100 percent completion rate was unprecedented.
“We have never been able to say that before,” she wrote. “I am grateful to the students and colleagues who worked hard to make that a reality this year.”
Last academic year, 71 percent of students completed the training. During the 2016-2017 school year, 67 percent of College students completed the training offered that year — a statistic Title IX experts said was an impressive completion rate, but still left room for improvement.
The online training was redone this yeart to incorporate student feedback from last year, including a more streamlined module and scenarios that were meant to resonate more with students. Miller said that despite the positive student feedback in both of these areas, plans for revising the module further are already in the works.
“We are always looking for ways to improve the training, and I have already met with several students who have ideas for new scenarios we could roll out next year,” Miller wrote. “We will be hosting student-led focus groups in the coming weeks to solicit more student input.”
The College instituted its online training modules in 2016 after a 2015 sexual conduct climate survey found that 31 percent of female undergraduate seniors at the time had experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact.” Sixteen percent of female seniors reported that they had experienced sexual penetration or attempted penetration without their consent during that time.
Former University President Drew G. Faust called the survey results “troubling” at the time and convened a sexual assault prevention task force to address the issue. The task force released recommendations in early 2016 that included sexual harassment prevention training, limiting the influence of the school’s all-male final clubs, creating a new administrative role for sexual assault prevention, and banning hard liquor on Harvard’s campus.
The school’s Title IX office split in two last year and formed the Office for Dispute Resolution, which formally investigates Title IX complaints and incidents. The Title IX Office, now headed by Nicole Merhill, provides resources and trainings for students, faculty, and staff. The University saw an overall increase in reports of sexual harassment during the 2016-2017 academic year — the latest for which data is available. Title IX administrators also observed an uptick in formal complaints following the Harvey Weinstein scandal last year, which launched the international #MeToo movement.

The way Adam Clymer ’58 saw it, being called an asshole by the president of the United States was a badge of honor.
It was the fall of 2000 — in the thick of that year’s presidential race — and Clymer was covering a George W. Bush rally for the New York Times. Clymer had previously authored some relatively unfavorable articles about Bush, so — when the Texan spotted Clymer in the crowd — he leaned over to his running mate to alert him.
“There’s Adam Clymer, major-league asshole from the New York Times,” Bush said to Cheney.
He was unaware that his microphone had picked up the exchange, broadcasting his aside to the crowd — and later, the nation. In the aftermath, Clymer appeared on the front pages of newspapers across the country, a phenomenon that Christopher Jencks ’58, a former college classmate of Clymer’s, said elicited “a big smile” from those familiar with his old friend’s work.
“By then, Adam was a distinguished journalist,” Jencks said. “It was fun to see him on the front page as a participant rather than an observer.”
“I think the ‘major-league asshole’ thing was a point of pride for Adam, even though his voice mail blew up with nasty messages from conservatives afterwards,” Maureen B. Dowd, a former colleague of Clymer’s and a long-time columnist for the Times, wrote in an email.
Clymer — a former Crimson president — died of pancreatic cancer in his home in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 10. He was 81.
During his long and storied career at the Times, Clymer covered, among other things, eight presidential elections, the Watergate scandal, and the Vietnam War. Outside of the newsroom, he wrote definitive histories of the life of Edward M. Kennedy and political drama at the Panama Canal. He was known among colleagues as a journalist and editor with an undying devotion to to “getting it right,” Jencks said.
Clymer got his start in journalism at The Harvard Crimson. There, he covered a wide range of topics, interviewing politicians including Adlai Stevenson and surveying local precincts in presidential races.
According to Jencks — who worked with Clymer at The Crimson and later served as an editor for the New Republic — it “wasn’t an accident” that Clymer rose through the ranks to become president of the organization.
“He was the kind of person who would become president of something or other,” Jencks said.
During his tenure as president, Clymer was a “main man” in the fight to grant Radcliffe women full status as Crimson editors, according to George H. Watson ’58, who served as Managing Editor at the time. Back then, administrators required that women who wrote for the paper obey strict curfews, complicating staffers’ ability to produce The Crimson every night.
Watson wrote that Clymer’s battle to remove these curfews “wasn’t easy,” noting that the young president faced serious objections from both Harvard and Radcliffe administrators.
“One [objection] I remember was safety,” Watson wrote. “It was always after midnight before the paper ‘went to bed,’ so, was it safe for a young woman to walk from Plympton Street back to Radcliffe at that late hour? Adam’s answer is, ‘We will call a taxi.’”
Clymer ultimately gained his point, ushering in a new era of gender equality at 14 Plympton St.
He was a pioneering president in more ways than one.
In 1957, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to integrate nine African-American students into a segregated high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clymer saw an opportunity. Insisting that The Crimson “was not merely a campus newspaper,” he sent Watson to Arkansas to cover the now-infamous standoff over the Little Rock Nine.
“Adam insisted I should report from Little Rock,” Watson wrote. “I spent a week (neglecting classes) reporting on that notable time of racial integration in schools.”
The move was typical of the philosophy to which Clymer adhered throughout his career, according to peers. As former New York Times columnist Eugene J. “E.J.” Dionne ’73 put it, Clymer knew “what matters tomorrow morning” and also “how this fits into a much longer American story.”
After graduating magna cum laude from Harvard and spending two years pursuing graduate studies in South Africa, Clymer returned to the states and bounced from the Times to the Baltimore Sun and back again, earning a reputation for his gruffness, attention to detail, and “martini-dry sense of humor” along the way, Dowd wrote.
“He was meticulous about facts and rigorous about accuracy and had an encyclopedic knowledge of politics,” Dowd wrote.
Dionne said Clymer’s care extended to syntax.
“He was a stickler about words, particular words,” Dionne said. “He had a very particular affinity about using words that he thought were ‘proper.’”
Clymer took a particular interest in polling and data. He helped establish the New York Times/CBS News Poll, which his friend and executive editor of STAT Richard L. Berke called “the first poll of its kind” and “the first time a network and a news organization truly worked together.”
“He was sort of a pioneer in thinking about explaining the intersection between politics and policy and what’s on the mind of voters,” Berke said.
Over time, Clymer rose through the ranks at the Times to become — at various points — a polling editor, a politics editor, and a chief congressional correspondent.
Even as Clymer’s professional star soared, he never forgot about people. He could be prickly at first blush, Dowd conceded — but it didn’t last.
“The first impression of Adam was that he was very gruff and condescending. But he soon proved to be a very kind man and a great mentor, especially for women,” wrote Dowd, now a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer for the Times. “He was a dedicated feminist who unfailingly supported women at the paper.”
In a 2008 interview with The Crimson, Clymer said he had particularly enjoyed mentoring young journalists like Dowd, Dionne, and Berke while he worked as an editor.
“He was very dedicated to that sort of outreach and complimenting someone when they deserved it,” Berke said. “Many reporters would get notes from him more than they did their own editors, complimenting their work.”
Clymer is not survived by any immediate family members — his wife, Ann, died in 2013, and his daughter, Jane Emily, was killed by a drunk driver in 1985. In lieu of close relatives, prominent journalists — many of them former colleagues from the Times and Crimson alumni — took to social media last week to memorialize the man.
On Twitter, New York Times Opinion columnist Nicholas Kristof called Clymer an “ace reporter.” Dan Barry of the Times tweeted that Clymer was “crusty, determined, often in the mix of things.”
Clymer retired from the Times in 2003. In his leisure years, he once again took over leadership of The Crimson, serving as chair of the paper’s graduate council from 2003 to 2008. Berke said Clymer frequently spoke of his love for the student-run publication.
When Clymer turned 60, Berke gifted him a mock Crimson front page adorned with a caricature of Clymer drawn during his presidency. Since 1953, every single Crimson president has sat for a similar cartoon. Clymer’s picture hangs in The Crimson’s newsroom today alongside those of his predecessors and successors.
Clymer told The Crimson in 2008 that he decided to retire from writing because “full-time work interferes with fishing,” a lifelong passion of his.  He was “extraordinarily active” up until his death, according to Watson; even though suffering from multiple illnesses and dependent on a walker, Clymer recently traveled from Washington to Montana to spend a week fly fishing.
A few days before dying from pancreatic cancer in his bed in the early hours of the morning, Clymer nabbed a four-pound trout. It was a personal record.
He also continued to write about politics for the Times into his eighties, penning obituaries for several politicians he had interviewed in years past. Robert H. Sand ’58, who served as editorial chair of The Crimson while Clymer was president, noted that two of these obituaries ran in print less than a week before Clymer’s death.
“Two byline pieces up on the Times,” Sand said. “That’s a nice tombstone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost half of the Undergraduate Council representatives who served during the spring term will not be returning to the council, which will begin holding elections on Monday.
At least 23 representatives who served during the spring term — of 51 total members — are either declining to run for re-election or have resigned their positions in recent months. In addition, six former UC representatives graduated in May.
Of the at least 23 students who will not be returning to the Council this fall — a figure which could run higher if any current representatives lose their bids for re-election — eight resigned in the spring and 15 are not running for re-election.
Among the impacts of high turnover on the Council are a loss of several high-ranking members of the body, particularly on some of the UC’s committees.
The Finance Committee, which manages a roughly $300,000 budget — a figure which could jump after the student activities fee more than doubled this academic year — will be particularly hard hit, with nine of its 12 members leaving, including its chair.
Henry S. Atkins ’20, the Finance Committee chair, is among the 23 representatives who will not return this fall. As a member of the UC’s executive committee, Atkins did not need to run for re-election until the spring, however, he indicated that he was forced to choose between the Council and ROTC due to the high time commitments required by both activities.
“I’m leaving in order to better commit myself to Army ROTC here,” Atkins wrote. “I need to make sure I’m giving my fullest to the program this year.”
Several other UC executive committee members, who also did not need to stand for re-election this fall, are also resigning from the Council, including Council Secretary Jackson Walker ’21 and Rules Committee chair Wilfried J. Zibell ’21.
The number of UC representatives not returning to the Council this fall exceeds last year’s turnover. After the fall 2017 elections, 18 seats previously held by students still enrolled at the College turned over. In addition, the Council lost four members of the Class of 2017 who graduated.
Most of the UC representatives who are not returning to the Council did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment. For those who provided a justification for their departure, many agreed with Atkins, citing the high time commitment associated with serving on the UC as a significant reason for not continuing to be involved.
Others, though, pointed to a desire to pursue other interests.
Eliot House Representative Nick Wyville ’20 wrote in an email that he decided that he wanted a different avenue to advocate for issues he cares about.  He said he will be working with an organization that advocates for criminal justice reform, as well as supporting Democratic candidates in this fall’s midterm elections.
“As Harvard students we all have immense amounts of privilege and can afford to work on such niche issues that the UC works on, and I believe this is a time that we must step back and realize that about ourselves,” he wrote. “These times call for bolder action on a national political level, and that’s why I will be actively campaigning for Democrats until November, and not working on campus-specific issues.”
Though around half of the Council will turn over with the installation of new members later this month, UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said the Council leaders would need to redouble efforts to ensure the body continued to operate efficiently in the wake of the elections.
“On the outside, it seems like a large turnover, but something that is important to us is having structures and having systems to be able to effectively train and help develop students to be leaders in their own capacity," she said.
The Finance Committee will lose three-quarters of its spring members, but returning members said they believe the committee’s operations will not be hampered.
“The Finance Committee has a very horizontal operating structure, so I think we should be fine,” said Dunster House Representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19. “A lot of it has been automated, we have a system through which we input all of the grants, so I really don’t see there being any problems with us getting student groups their money.”
Council Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20, called the high number of exits on the Finance Committee, known as “FiComm,” “unfortunate,” predicting that she and other senior Council members would mostly likely need to at least temporarily fulfill additional roles.
“For a while, it might mean I have to do some of the lifting that a very seasoned FiComm chair would do until our FiComm chair learn the ropes,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawrence D. Bobo, professor of African and African American Studies and Sociology, will become the divisional dean of Social Science for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on October 1.
Bobo first joined the Faculty in 1997. From 2005 to 2007, he briefly left Harvard for Stanford, where he headed Stanford’s Center of Comparative Study in Race and Ethnicity. Bobo has served as chair of the AAAS Department since 2013.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay — who served as dean of Social Science before assuming her current role this summer — announced Bobo's appointment Monday.
As Social Science dean, Bobo will oversee all departments, centers, and programs within the Social Science division of FAS, and will serve as a member of the Academic Planning Group, a board which advises Gay on policy and resource issues.
In her announcement, Gay cited Bobo’s assistance in the “Inequality in America” Initiative, a multidisciplinary effort to conduct and publicize research on social and economic inequality. Bobo helped Gay found the initiative during her own term as dean.
Several of Bobo’s colleagues praised his selection, calling his appointment “fantastic” and “wonderful”.
“He’s been an extraordinary chair [of the AAAS department],” said AAAS and Anthropology Professor John Comaroff. “He’s a very imaginative, strong leader. He’s very supportive of his colleagues and students. He’s a man who can listen very carefully to those around him.”
History and AAAS Professor Emmanuel K. Akyeampong said he has confidence in Bobo’s leadership, as demonstrated during his tenure as AAAS department chair and as a key figure at the Hutchins Center for African and African American Studies.
Bobo assumes the deanship as FAS adjusts to a new schedule, new President, and new Dean, and copes with a growing national skepticism of higher education.
Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild, who has a joint appointment in AAAS, said she anticipates that a top challenge for Bobo will be to work on “incorporating the Allston community” within the course schedule when Harvard’s Allston campus opens in 2020.
Both Comaroff and AAAS Professor Suzanne P. Blier said that Bobo will also face the challenge of becoming dean in a political climate that they called “very challenging”.
“I can think of no one I would trust more to help to shape this institution going forward,” Blier wrote in an emailed statement.
Some colleagues also commented on Bobo’s excellence as a teacher. He was named a Harvard College Professor — a prestigious award specifically honoring excellence in undergraduate teaching — in 2018.
Akyeampong cited “intellectual curiosity” as one of Bobo’s strengths. He recalled an episode in 2016 when AAAS 11: “Introduction to African Studies” was reorganized and taught by six professors, including Akyeampong, instead of the usual single lecturer.
“Larry said that this was an opportunity for him to hear his colleagues in African Studies give lectures. So though he was not teaching in this course, he attended every single lecture, twice a week, for fourteen weeks,” Akyeampong said.
“For the lectures I gave, I can tell you, he probably took more notes than the students who were there for credit in the course,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has debuted a new procedure for punishing student groups that violate school policy.
The new system — detailed in the 2018-2019 Recognized Student Organization Resource and Policy Guide — outlines a four-step process by which administrators will address alleged violations of College rules: “Report,” “Review of Incident,” “Outcome,” and “Appeal.”
The guide also details possible punishments that Harvard can deliver to organizations found in violation of school policy. A “Warning” — the weakest action — means the College will send a formal communication alerting the group to its misstep. Under “Revocation,” the strongest penalty, administrators will revoke recognition for the group, prohibiting it from using Harvard’s name and brand. Organizations disciplined in this manner will have “no opportunity” to re-apply for recognition.
Intermediate to the two most extreme punishments are “Period of Probation” and “Suspension.” Groups put on probation will be “given the opportunity to demonstrate [their] ability to abide” by Harvard’s policies and procedures. At the discretion of the College, probation may also lead to a temporary suspension of party-hosting privileges and other benefits typically afforded to recognized student organizations. The guide does not specify how long probation will last.
Organizations facing suspension are required to “cease all organizational activities” for a window of time determined by the Dean of Students Office.
Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller announced the plan during a series of mandatory meetings attended by leaders of recognized undergraduate student groups last Wednesday and Thursday. Miller said the new system is meant to update and clarify Harvard’s disciplinary process, which he said had confused some students.
The College’s procedure for punishing campus groups was put to the test last semester.
In February, administrators placed Harvard College Faith and Action — the largest Christian fellowship on campus — on “administrative probation” after The Crimson reported that the group had pressured a female student to step down from a leadership position following her decision to date a woman. In the weeks that followed, students — among them members of the Undergraduate Council — struggled to understand the terms of HCFA’s probation, which had little to no immediate practical effect.
At the meetings last week, Miller stressed that the Dean of Students Office will not apply the new disciplinary process to past policy violations committed by student groups.
In an email Monday, Miller appeared to tie the new system to last semester’s HCFA controversy.
“While this was not specifically in response to HCFA, the concerns raised with HCFA last Spring underscored the need for this and the time-sensitivity of putting this process in place now,” Miller wrote in an emailed statement provided by spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman. “This was an identified gap in our processes, and we developed this over the summer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School has taken a number of steps in recent months to address concerns students and faculty raised about diversity at the school last year — and students have praised the changes and pledged to keep pushing for more.
Activism around diversity came to a head last spring, when students held town halls, hung posters around the school, and organized school-wide events to call attention to the dearth of women and minorities at the school.
Concerns raised years earlier prompted Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf to organize an internal task force in 2016 dedicated to creating a report about the demographic makeup of the school, the diversity of its curriculum, and the experiences of people of different genders and races at the school.
The 76-page long report, circulated internally starting in May 2017, highlighted stark underrepresentation in the racial and gender makeup of HKS affiliates. African-American students constituted only 4 percent of the Masters in Public Policy program, the school’s largest degree program, in 2015. “Hispanic Americans” and Asian-Americans each made up 7 percent of MPP students in 2015 — and the school saw declines in the percentage of students in all three categories between 2005 and 2015.
The report recommended the Dean hire an administrator to focus solely on diversity and inclusion. Elmendorf appointed Robbin Chapman the Associate Dean of Diversity and Inclusion in Jan. 2018. Chapman is now working at the School “full-time,” according to Kennedy School Dean of Communications Thoko Moyo.
Even as the school has made strides, Priyanka Kaura — a student involved in activism last semester — said students will continue to advocate for additional measures to diversify the school.
"There are still a lot of us that are interested in continuing the work has been going on and that was amplified last year,” Kaura said. “We're still here, we still care strongly about advocating for diversity and inclusion and belonging and we do plan to sustain those efforts.”
Camilla N. Taufic, another student leader, said Chapman “should be a partner” to the group.
“She [Chapman] came to almost all of the events that were hosted last year by students and faculty at the end of the year,” Taufic said. “I think even before she was officially going into school, she attended one of the events. She's definitely shown that she's here and she's caring.”
Chapman could not be reached for comment.
Apart from hiring Chapman, the school also held a structured retreat focused on diversity and inclusion over the summer, which faculty and administrators attended.
Kennedy School student Eamon S. O’Connor called it a “notable” development in the administrators’ response to last year’s protests.
Moyo wrote in an email that “some” faculty and staff underwent training on diversity-related issues before the academic year started.
“The trainings covered a number of topics including: unconscious bias; making productive connections, issuing and accepting observations (bystander skills),” Moyo wrote.
O’Connor said the school’s response has exceeded his hopes.
“The fact that it happened, just kind of miles beyond what we could've expected,” he said.
O’Connor also pointed to the appointments of Cornell W. Brooks – the former NAACP CEO who will serve as a professor of public leadership and social justice — and Brittany Packnett,  the vice-president of national community alliances and engagement at Teach for America, as an IOP fellow. He called them “small kernels of hope,” adding that Brooks and Packnett “bring a lens that maybe HKS wasn't devoting as much real estate to.”
Taufic said cultivating further faculty support for diversity initiatives at the school will be a priority for student activists, as well as advocating for diversity in admissions and hiring — ideas she said the administration is “pretty open to hearing about.”
Elmendorf has appointed several women to high-level administrative roles within the last year, according to an email he sent in August to Kennedy School affiliates.
Iris Bohnet, who served as the school’s academic dean from 2011 to 2014, is returning to the role after Kennedy School Professor Archon Fung stepped down from the position. Janney Wilson, the school’s chief financial and administrative officer, was appointed to the role of executive dean, and Debbie Isaacson, an alumna of the school, will now serve as the school’s senior associate dean for degree programs and student affairs.
These appointments come after a number of African American women left high-profile administrative positions at the school within a span of six months. One specifically cited inadequate support from the school as the reason for her departure.
Taufic said the group of student activists, as well as new students joining them this semester, “are really excited” about the work and community they hope to build within the academic year. The group circulated flyers to encourage participation in diversity activism at the school’s admitted students’ weekend in the spring.
“There is a community of people at the school who are interested in creating a more open, welcoming space for people,” Taufic said. “And so I think that there are people who, myself included, are just really excited about about this community, and there's a lot of energy that comes from that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a team that finished the previous fall with a 10-1 regular season record, competed in the FCS playoffs, and had its quarterback named to this year’s Walter Payton Award watch list visits town, teams cannot expect to walk away with a three-touchdown margin of victory. But Harvard football (1-0) did just that on Saturday, as it soundly defeated San Diego (1-2), 36-14.
A THUNDERSTORM IN THE FORECAST
It makes sense that football teammates often end up as roommates, but sophomore duo Aaron Shampklin and Devin Darrington had more in common than just their address on Saturday. The two worked seamlessly out of the backfield, offsetting pass plays with a combination of power and speed to fuel the Crimson offense.
Darrington (nicknamed “Thunderbolt” according to head coach Tim Murphy) and Shampklin (“Lightfoot”) served two different but complementary roles in the team’s first game. Darrington fits the mold of a smashmouth runner, slowly grinding down opposing defenses and carrying the ball a considerable amount of times. Shampklin, on the other hand, is shiftier and makes hard, quick cuts to blast past defenders. Darrington is listed at 5’9”, 205 pounds, while Shampklin is 5’10”, 180 pounds.
“Teams have to game-plan for both of us,” Shampklin said. “And then we also have a lot of other great running backs in the backfield that you guys haven’t even seen yet, so once they come out there, teams are really going to have to game-plan against that.”
The emergence of these two running backs could not have come at a better time. Senior rushers Charlie Booker and Semar Smith missed the game for unspecified reasons—Booker was listed as the top running back on the pregame depth chart but did not see the field. Last season, Booker rushed for 733 yards (5.2 per carry) and scored six touchdowns.
ON THE FRONT LINES
Murphy often credits the big men up front as being the building blocks of Harvard’s success, and they certainly lived up to their coach’s billing on Saturday. The offensive line paved the way for a punishing ground game and gave sophomore quarterback Jake Smith tons of time to go through his progressions in the pocket.
On the flip side, the defensive line did just the opposite, as it stunted much of the Toreros’ running progress and hurried quarterback Anthony Lawrence numerous times to throw him off his game.
“Number one, we made a commitment to doing a better job running the football in the offseason in a variety of ways,” Murphy said. “Two, it all starts with defense, and if you hold any opponent we have on our schedule to 14, you’ve done a terrific job. So based on that we did a really good job in the trenches.”
Led by the sophomore roommates, the Crimson’s rushing attack dominated by breaking out for a number of long gains. Harvard tacked on 266 rushing yards on 40 carries, good for 6.7 yards per attempt.
“The o-line today was really moving the line of scrimmage,” Shampklin said. “They do the work that doesn’t really get congratulated on. All of my runs were because of the o-line moving and getting up to the linebackers, making it easier for me.”
One of those long runs in particular shows off the o-line’s impact on Saturday. As the Crimson lined up at the visitors’ 23-yard line, Jake Smith handed the ball off to Shampklin, who entered the play from the quarterback’s left side.
Shampklin then stopped in his tracks and cut up the middle, where a gigantic hole had formed. On the left, senior linemen Larry Allen and Tim O’Brien paired up to wall off two Toreros defenders, and junior tight end John Stivers cut in behind the line to fortify the right side along with junior lineman Liam Shanahan. The end result was a one-on-one matchup between Shampklin and San Diego safety Daniel Tolbert, which Shampklin won with ease and broke free untouched en route to his second touchdown.
Though the Toreros lost the rushing battle, comparing the two teams’ passing attacks must have been more difficult for anyone sitting in the stands. Looking at the results on paper, however, shows that Harvard came out on top in this arena as well.
San Diego outgained the Crimson in the air, 298 yards to 195, but the Crimson was more efficient. Smith completed 13-of-21 passes, while the Toreros’ Anthony Lawrence was 23-for-46 and tossed an interception.
Throughout the game, Lawrence showed flashes of his standing as a top FCS signal caller, especially when targeting Michael Bandy (12 catches, 202 yards). However, he was forced into attempting many low-percentage throws due to the pressure imposed by Harvard’s front seven. By the final whistle, Lawrence had been hurried 14 times. For comparison, Smith was hurried just twice.
The Crimson also stood its ground when it mattered, as San Diego finished just 4-of-18 on third and fourth down conversion attempts.
EARLY AND OFTEN
For whatever reason, Harvard has dominated historically in the early portion of its season. Going all the way back to 2001, the Crimson has won its past 18 home openers. In the first game of the season, regardless of location, the team is 15-3 in the past 18 years. Throughout program history, the team has maintained this record of success almost exactly with a 119-24-2 record, good for a .828 winning percentage.
Not only did Harvard kick off its season with a bang, but it also began the game with a dizzying first quarter replete with four touchdowns. San Diego hit a field goal with 11:32 left in the quarter to open the scoring. Twenty seconds of game time later, the Crimson had erased that lead. On the second play from scrimmage, Shampklin sprinted 64 yards to find the end zone, and he would repeat that action twice more in the quarter.
Harvard found the end zone on four consecutive drives, spanning just over nine minutes of game action. In total, those four drives featured just 12 plays despite accounting for a whopping 250 yards gained.
The Crimson’s 27 first-quarter points are the most it has scored in any frame since Sept. 28, 2013 against Brown. In that game, Harvard went on to win, 41-23.
Interestingly, 2013 was the last year in which the Crimson matched up against San Diego. In the first week of that season, Harvard traveled to California and won, 42-20, to open a season in which it finished 9-1 and won the Ivy League Championship.
PLAY THAT BACK
The Ivy League is steeped in tradition, but slowly the confe rence continues to adopt rule changes that bring it up to speed with other major collegiate conferences and professional leagues. Though the Harvard football team still will not be able to qualify for the FCS Championship, it will see replay review used in its games.
On Saturday, the new policy made an appearance early on. With 5:45 remaining in the first quarter, the Crimson began a drive at its own 10-yard line and quickly advanced to the San Diego three-yard line with 45 yards on four carries from Darrington and a 42-yard pass caught by senior wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley mixed in.
On Darrington’s fifth carry of the drive, the sophomore dove toward the goal line and barely snuck the ball across the plane. Replay staff walked onto the field, and the score was quickly confirmed by an official.
“The bottom line is it’s good for football,” Murphy said. “There’s an opportunity to make it right, and I think that’s a good thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team has had a slow start to the beginning of its season. However, several of the teams on the Crimson’s early-season slate have been ranked among the top 25 Division-I programs.
This weekend, Harvard (1-5) tripped to Colorado to challenge two such foes: No. 5 Denver and No. 23 Air Force. As their rankings may suggest, the home teams ran away with both games, as the Crimson fell to the Pioneers, 3-1, before bowing out to the Falcons by an even more lopsided score of 6-1.
Despite the disappointing results, Harvard has no choice but to extract the few bright spots from the weekend and look to build upon them as it prepares for the next opponent on the schedule.
“It was a tough loss, but we will use the film as an opportunity to see where we can improve,” said Crimson co-captain Nathan Goldberg. “We just need to focus on the next game at hand against Boston University.”
AIR FORCE 6, HARVARD 1
The Crimson’s Sunday matchup saw an already-writhing team clash with a Falcons (7-1) squad that entered the contest riding high on a six-game winning streak, accounting for all of their victories at the time.
This positive momentum fed the home team in its thrashing of the Ivy League visitors. And it did not take long for the the Falcons to draw first blood on a shot from 10 yards out in the eighth minute.
Air Force found the net again in the 27th and 45th minutes of the match, adding some cushion to its first-half lead. The Falcons showed no signs of letting up in the second half, striking two more times as the second half opened, in the 50th and 57th minutes.
In a five-goal hole, Harvard finally responded. Just two minutes after Air Force freshman JT D’Emidio found twine to extend the disparity to 5-0, Harvard first-year Alfred Perez scored his first career goal.
Fellow freshman Nico Garcia-Morillo logged his first-ever assist on the play after finding Perez on the edge of the six-yard box. Perez’s shot crossed the plane after ricocheting off the frame.
In the 69th minute of the game, the Falcons had the last word, netting one last goal to silence the Crimson.
DENVER 3, HARVARD 1
Two days before the 6-1 blowout in Colorado Springs, Harvard visited its highest-ranked competitor yet in Denver (6-0-1)—a new opponent for the Crimson program. Two Pioneers goals, courtesy of senior Andre Shinyashiki and redshirt freshman Brooks Crawford, within minutes of each other in the first half (24’, 27’) set the tone for the match.
Harvard’s lone goal of the match came from co-captain Sam Brown. Brown’s free kick strike from 20 yards got his Crimson on the board after two scoreless games.
Freshman goalie David Paquette logged a career-high nine saves in his second-ever appearance. Paquette and his supporting back line managed to keep the Pioneers in check until the 24th minute, when the defense appeared to break down and concede two crucial goals in rapid succession.
At the midpoint of the second half, Denver scored again to pad the lead at three—Shinyashiki tallied his second of the match, thrusting him into double-digit scoring for the season through just six games.
The next time Harvard plays will be against Boston University on Wednesday—the team’s first game at Jordan Field in three contests and the final match on the Crimson’s schedule before its Ancient Eight opener against Yale on the following Saturday.
“Collectively and individually we are constantly looking to improve,” said junior midfielder Taner Dogan. “The upcoming week and half without a match will give us time to train and address some areas of improvement.”
