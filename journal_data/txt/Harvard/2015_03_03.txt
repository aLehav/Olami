After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even amidst the brilliant constellation of Van Gogh’s œuvre, this is a painting whose star shines brightly. Maybe it is the way the artist painted the background, the thick brushstrokes ringing the sitter’s head like a saint’s nimbus. Maybe it is the studied contrasts of the composition: green against rust, the face’s iridescent sheen against the drab jacket. Maybe it is the distortions Van Gogh worked upon his features, casting himself as a shaven-pated Buddhist monk.
Whatever it is that accounts for the particular allure of “Self-Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin,” there is no denying that it is a hard painting to forget. In photographs, the background has a tendency to come out a tranquil seafoam; in person, however, it is electric, alive. And perhaps that energy above all else is why the painting caught the eye of Maurice Wertheim, class of 1906, who bequeathed the work to Harvard upon his death in 1951. If you go to the Harvard Art Museums today, you can see it—hanging in the first room to the right of the entrance, it pulls viewers to it like moths to a light.
From a purely technical standpoint, there is no doubt that the work is extremely accomplished. But what many of the visitors drawn in by its ineffable charm may not know is that the painting has a history with richness to match: a ruined friendship, a destroyed museum, a Nazi art auction. This is that story.
STUDIO OF THE SOUTH
At the top of the painting, just below the edge of the frame, is a faint series of squiggles that viewers standing far away might be hard-pressed to recognize as letters, if they notice them at all. Heavily abraded, they are the remains of what would once have been a prominent dedication: “à mon ami Paul.”
The friend in question, of course, is none other than Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh painted the work in 1888 and gave it to his fellow artist as part of a portrait exchange that also included Émile Bernard. Later that same year, Van Gogh would succeed in convincing Gauguin to join him in Arles. “Part of the idea was to go to the south. There was a different light, a very different climate,” explains Henri Zerner, a professor of modern art in the History of Art and Architecture Department. “And the exchange of portraits is part of Van Gogh’s idea of forming a sort of art colony, an art commune, basically.”
Van Gogh wrote about the portrait several times in letters to his brother, Theo. One such letter, written in October of 1888, reads: “Someday you will also see my self-portrait, which I am sending to Gauguin, because he will keep it, I hope.” Before the year was out, however, their relationship imploded spectacularly. “Van Gogh was extremely emotional, obviously, and probably expected too much,” Zerner says. “And Gauguin…” Zerner shows me a letter written to him by John Rewald, a major scholar of impressionism and post-impressionism, in which the historian describes his growing disillusionment with the artist he had once so admired: “Gauguin was one of the heroes, if not the hero, of my childhood…. During my first visit to France at the age of 19, I passed all my days at the Louvre copying one of his paintings. But [Gauguin’s] writings, which I have collected for over 20 years, revealed to me little by little a fellow of often unsavory character.”
Likely as a result of their extreme personalities, the relationship between Van Gogh and Gauguin deteriorated quickly. Several months after the self-portrait’s completion, Van Gogh was committed to a mental institution following the acute psychotic episode during which he sliced off a part of his own ear. After Van Gogh’s hospitalization, they never met again. “[Their friendship lasted] a matter of months, really,” Zerner says. “Van Gogh only lives for a year and a half after [their parting]. They didn’t have a chance to make it up.”
So who tried to remove the dedication on Van Gogh’s self-portrait? The question was the subject of a 1984 investigation published by the Harvard University Art Museums’ Center for Conservation and Technical Studies (now the Harvard Art Museums and the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, respectively). H. Travers Newton, one of the two authors of the study, could not be reached for comment; Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski, his co-author, is deceased. Representatives of the Harvard Art Museums declined multiple requests for comment on the study.
The investigation report lays out several possible theories regarding how the dedication came to be destroyed. Though Bernard, the third member of the painting exchange, would eventually fall out with Gauguin and may thus have had motive, the study argues that it is unlikely he would have had access to the portrait. Van Gogh himself is another candidate; the authors of the investigation cite worsening mental health and increasing bitterness towards the man for whom he painted it as possible reasons. Yet according to Jirat-Wasiutynski and Newton’s report, the most likely perpetrator is none other than Gauguin. In 1897, eager to raise funds for a trip to Tahiti, Gauguin hocked Van Gogh’s self-portrait to a Parisian art dealer. It’s possible, Jirat-Wasiutynski and Newton argue, that Gauguin effaced the dedication while preparing it for sale. Even so, it sold for only 300 francs. “A workman made maybe two francs a day, so it’s probably half a year’s salary for a capable workman,” Zerner says. “But by then, Monet would sell for considerably more than that…. I would think 10 times that.”
ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
After Gauguin sold the painting, Van Gogh’s self-portrait made its way to Berlin, where, according to the Harvard Art Museums’ records, it was purchased by Hugo von Tschudi in 1906. Von Tschudi had wanted to acquire the piece for the National Gallery in Berlin, where he worked. But things didn’t go as planned. “It took a long time before it ended up in a museum,” says Sarah Kianovsky, a curator of modern and contemporary art at the Harvard Art Museums. “At that time, you needed to get approval to acquire pieces, and he couldn’t because it was too avant-garde.”
It was only upon his death in 1919 that the painting finally found its way into a museum: Von Tschudi’s wife donated the work to the Neue Staatsgalerie in Munich, where the couple had relocated. But just 20 years later the portrait was moved again, this time by the Nazis.
Along with the works of many artists who strayed from strict naturalistic representation, Van Gogh’s paintings were branded by the German government as “degenerate art” and suppressed by the fascists, Kianovsky explains. “It was really about putting forward one version of a culture and eliminating everything that resisted it. There were works that were put into degenerate art shows, some into markets, and some were deliberately destroyed in bonfires.” The Nazis’ targeting of “degenerate art” brought tumult to the art world: Works were removed from public museums, stolen from victims of the Holocaust, and looted from foreign art institutions as the Wehrmacht pushed outwards, she notes.
“Self-Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin” did not escape the Nazis’ notice. Though records differ about the exact year of its seizure—varying documents in the Harvard Art Museums’ object file cite 1937 and 1938—by 1939 the painting had been transported to Lucerne to be sold at a Nazi-run auction.
As a fundraising endeavor, the auction was not a rousing success; many paintings were not sold, and a number that did went for as little as £20 or £30, according to the sale catalog (roughly $1,500-$1,600 in modern dollars). The Van Gogh sold for £12,000—enough of a surprise for the auctioneer to annotate the catalog with an exclamation mark. If this figure seems high compared to the other lots at auction, a comparable self-portrait by Van Gogh was purchased in 1998 for $103.8 million, making it the most expensive self-portrait ever sold.
The circumstances surrounding the auction were controversial even at the time; some collectors refused to attend. But, according to documents in the Harvard Art Museums’ object file for the self-portrait, this was not a concern shared by Wertheim, whose proxy, Alfred Frankfurter, purchased the Van Gogh. “Wertheim seemed to believe that to support what the Nazis detested was justifiable,” the file says.
Wertheim was not alone in believing his participation in the auction of Nazi-confiscated art to be justified; another buyer at the show was Joseph Pulitzer Jr., grandson of the famous journalist after whom the Pulitzer Prize is named. Pierre Matisse, the youngest son of the famous Fauvist Henri Matisse, acted as Pulitzer’s proxy and bought back his father’s “Bathers with a Turtle.” The presence of Pierre Matisse was a powerful symbol of defiance against the Nazis’ attempts to suppress “degenerate art.”
Recent years have seen increasing efforts to track down and return works that were stolen by the Nazis. “In the late ’90s, [a] government conference was convened in Washington, D.C., and this conference was about how to deal with Nazi looted art. And the result of this was the Washington Declaration,” Jutta von Falkenhausen, a German lawyer who specializes in restitution, told The Crimson for a February 2014 article on the Allies’ efforts to retrieve art stolen by the Nazis. “[The signatories] undertook whatever [was] in their power to search for looted art and find a just, fair solution—which often means restitution.” Kianovsky herself was part of an effort to investigate and clarify the provenance of several pieces in the Harvard Art Museums that had unclear origins, including works donated by Wertheim and Pulitzer.
But while much art that traded hands during this period has been the subject of restitution claims, “Self-Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin” has not. “State paintings are not subject to restitution claims,” Kianovsky says. Though works that were taken from private owners or looted from foreign museums must be returned, she explains, the Van Gogh was removed by the government from a government-owned institution. Therefore, the subsequent sale was legal. Matisse’s “Bathers with a Turtle,” which originated from the Folkwang Museum in Essen, is in a similar situation.
What’s more, the museum in which the self-portrait once hung no longer exists—the building that housed the Neue Staatsgalerie is now the Staatliche Antikensammlungen, a museum of antiquities. Kianovsky says that the Bavarian State Paintings Collections, under the purview of which the Van Gogh would have fallen while in Munich, has never asked for the paintings back, a fact that representatives from the Collections confirm. According to Tine Nehler, who works at the Neue Pinakothek, another Munich-based museum where much of the Neue Staatsgalerie’s previous collection is now housed, this is very much a deliberate choice. “Almost every European museum has paintings from other collections [that] might [have] belong[ed] to other museums before World War II,” she wrote in an emailed statement. Reverting to pre-war conditions, she said, would be a gargantuan undertaking. “Leaving the collections in the state after 1945 means furthermore to demonstrate the historical situation after the Nazi regime.” Van Gogh’s self-portrait did make its way back to Munich once since it was removed, participating in a temporary exhibition at the Neue Pinakothek in 1997.
In yet another twist, the painting’s seizure may be precisely the reason why it still exists today. As the war intensified, the Neue Staatsgalerie was forced to shut its doors. For safety, a large portion of the museum’s collection was transported either to store houses outside the city or to other museums, but a number of works were stored in the building’s cellar. An Allied bombing raid severely damaged the structure; many works inside were destroyed.
REFLECTING ON THE SELF
Seventy-six years since the auction in Lucerne, Van Gogh’s “Self-Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin” is now one of the most iconic works of the Harvard Art Museums’ collections. With its luminous green background, it has a tendency to arrest the gaze of even the most casual visitor, demanding more prolonged attention. It is a fate that in all likelihood Van Gogh never imagined for what he had intended to be a gift for a friend.
Scarcely two years after he completed the work, Van Gogh was again seized by the depression that had destroyed his dreams of founding a long-term artistic commune with Gauguin. Wading out into a field of wheat, Van Gogh shot himself through the chest. Though the wound itself was not enough to kill, the attendant infection proved fatal. He died in his brother’s arms.
“It is a great picture,” Zerner says. “It might even be [Van Gogh’s] most famous self-portrait, so we are very lucky to have it here.” From an artist’s collective in Arles to Gauguin’s Paris studio, from an art dealer in Berlin to a state museum in Munich, from an auction of “degenerate art” to pride of place on the walls of the Harvard Art Museums: This painting, there is no doubt, has had quite a journey.

This past week, in commemoration of its twentieth anniversary, Val Caniparoli’s “Lady of the Camellias” premiered at the Boston Ballet. Based on the novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas, conceptualized by the late Canadian master Norbert Vesak, and set to ravishing yet tender music by Chopin, the Boston Ballet’s “Lady” is a heartfelt expression of love and regret and a delicate meditation on the passing of time. Its opening moments, however, give only the slightest hint of the deep poetic drama that is to come.
A group of French Second Empire society women, brandishing fans and mimed giggles, consort with men in frills who execute fine, if empty, pirouettes and jetés alongside their partners. Theirs is a gilded world where immense, ornate double-doors open without a sound. Dancers literally fall on the floor before their neglecting lovers, only to spring up again with a horrifying mechanical immediacy, as if unable to sustain for even a moment the illusion of being real people who could be put out by sorrow or pain. The toy-like insubstantiality of these society types is matched by Alex Foaksman’s live piano, which has a facetious tinkling music-box quality.
Fortunately, soon the affected gives way to the affecting. Enter two pure-hearted individuals who don't play the love games so well: beautiful, secretly consumptive courtesan Marguerite (Kathleen Breen Combes) and her naïve young lover Armand Duval (Yury Yanowsky), who try to defy society’s rules, with tragic consequences. They are separated from each other by Marguerite’s rich current lover, the Baron de Varville (Bo Busby). The key to this show’s success is the immense sensitivity of the performances given by these principals, who bring great humanity to their roles. Their arabesques are more than arabesques; their acting and moves are finely integrated into the the overall ballet.
It is Yanowsky’s last show, and the fact that he and his wife are performing in the leading roles is evident from the palpable emotional depth in their moments together. When he lifts her, when she kisses him, when they run at each other while the Chopin from the piano reaches an ethereal appassionato—a real excitement, attended by fragility, is there in those pas de deux.
The pair’s acting is no less superb. In one of the greatest moments of the show, Armand sees Marguerite rejoining her rich former lover, the somber Baron. She has been forced to do so without Armand’s knowledge. The apparent betrayal stuns poor Armand. Moaning inaudibly, he lunges into a powerful manège around the stage that reveals how the pain is racking his whole body, twisting him every which way. She hides her unhappiness in order to keep him from hoping, and when he approaches she smiles at him and waves her arms out to the sides coquettishly, as if to say, “What did you expect, boy?” But her mouth visibly trembles as she does it. As soon as she turns away from him towards the side curtain, she leans forward, hands on her face, releasing her well-guarded despair.
Visually, too, “Lady” does not fail to meet the high standards of the Boston Ballet. The costumes by Robert Glay de la Rose, who previously worked for the Met Opera Ballet and has a reputation for meticulous attention to period accuracy, are magnificent in their rich detail and patterns. Glay de la Rose turns Marguerite in the drawing-room scenes into a living version of Ingre’s pensive Princesse de Broglie. The salon doors, designed by David Gano, recall Aubrey Beardsley’s dark, toxic Art Nouveau combination of simplicity and ornamentation. Chandeliers, similarly, are composed of slender dark spider-like lines huddling close together. These gothic overtones of the set in the society scenes of Act I and III, with their wide indigo background like a sky at evening, contrast with the cheerier pink-painted outdoors settings of Act II, where Marguerite lives happily with Armand instead of the Baron. In the lull of this summer love, Gano’s scenery bears the influence of Japanese art, with its flat planes and sharply defined edges, bringing a suspect kind of calm and simplicity to this world. Later the pink background fades into blue again, and in Act III the deep society blue returns to envelope the lovers under its unforgiving mantle.
It is a physically strange experience to sit at this ballet for two hours and watch as the heart’s softest flutters become incarnated in these articulate, professional limbs. The lead dancers take Caniparoli’s finely modulated choreography and render every turn of the leg, every embrace, pregnant with feeling. It is as if the plangent bars of Chopin governing their turns are not music, but life itself and the streaming seasons. They move as if in a dream, yet hyperalive. It is a brilliant performance to see—but, most of all, it’s an immersion.

Memories are a tricky thing. They can haunt in times of happiness and fortify in times of despair; they return over and over again when they are unwelcome, yet they often prove elusive when they are searched for the hardest. Memory and its various offspring—revenge, forgiveness, prejudice, hatred—lie at the heart of Kazuo Ishiguro’s latest novel, “The Buried Giant.” Although at times tiresome in its stilted dialogue and simplistic characters, “The Buried Giant” is nonetheless a moving parable of remembrance, loss, and the resilience of love.
From the first page of “The Buried Giant,” Ishiguro’s ability to build vivid, self-contained landscapes is clear. The novel is set in a semi-historical, semi-mythical English landscape where ogres roam freely, pixies and sprites wreak mischief, and a she-dragon named Querig hides out in the highlands. In this England, the reign of King Arthur has recently come to an end, and along with it the violence between Britons and Saxons. A wary peace prevails, yet it is a false one built largely upon the mist of forgetfulness that hangs over the land. People’s memories dissolve into a fog after weeks, days, or even hours; they live in a content, yet ultimately hollow, state. Little resentment between Saxons and Britons survives, because the terrible, bloody deeds of the past have been buried under a layer of collective forgetting. Ishiguro thus raises a compelling point, forcing the reader to consider whether a safe, peaceful life is worth the loss of memory and identity.
Much of Ishiguro’s story follows the rough outlines of a fairy tale: It follows an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice, as they set off to find the long-lost son they hardly remember. Along the way, they encounter several other mysterious figures and are embroiled in a greater drama centering around the dragon Querig. Standard fare, yet a second, more intriguing plot runs through “The Buried Giant.” Distraught widows, half-dead and half-alive, wander the countryside, speaking of a boatman who promised to ferry them and their husbands to a mystical island. These women have been left behind; the boatman took their husbands across but refused to return for them. Axl and Beatrice fear that they, too, will be separated in this way. Convinced that the mist of forgetfulness will hinder their safe passage, they devote themselves to finding its undoing. Both plots are skillfully executed; they wind neatly around one another and lend each other strength and forward motion.
Ishiguro’s greatest strength is his ability to move slowly through a plotline. Reading “The Buried Giant” feels like watching a master puppeteer, who, having constructed a magnificent diorama, reveals it by methodically opening a series of tiny windows in the front of the set. At no point does Ishiguro show the reader something that he doesn’t intend to; there is no bleeding between sections or cumbersome inclusion of less-than-vital information. The deliberate pacing and absolute control that Ishiguro displays in this novel are those of a storyteller at his peak.
However, “The Buried Giant” is not without its flaws. The story is heavily allegorical, and as often happens in such stories, the characters tend to seem less like people than archetypes, two-dimensional cutouts being moved around a stage to satisfy necessary plot points. The personalities of the minor characters are clichéd and rather bland: the battle-hardened warrior, the eager apprentice, the aging, loyal knight. Yet it is Axl and Beatrice, the story’s main figures, who are most shortchanged. Although there is nothing overtly wrong with Ishiguro’s depictions of them, there just isn’t anything particularly substantial or interesting. They move through the story as a single unit, always in tandem; Ishiguro thus sacrifices a chance to give his central characters more depth, which he could have done by allowing them to act as individuals.
The characters’ limited scope can often lead to dull moments within the story, yet the dullness of the language itself is on a whole new level of tedium. The novel has few moments of authorial exposition and relies instead on dialogue between characters to drive the plot forward. This technique would normally be harmless, yet in “The Buried Giant” Ishiguro takes on a cutesy, highly-affected lexicon that feels stilted and false. His contrived language not only detracts from the story’s real gravity but is also simply annoying. Axl and Beatrice refer to one another as “husband” and “princess,” respectively, virtually every time they speak to one another, so that a typical moment of dialogue runs thus: “‘Good morning, husband,’ she said eventually. ‘I’m glad to see the spirits chose not to take you away as I slept.’ ‘Princess, there’s something I want to talk about.’ ‘What is it you have to say, Axl, and before I’ve had time to rub the sleep from my eyes?’” Extrapolate this exchange to over 300 pages and the language soon turns from novel and appealing to purely kitschy.
“The Buried Giant” takes several more steps down the path of fantasy-fable that Ishiguro first tread in “Never Let Me Go.” Yet, whereas the story of “Never Let Me Go” took precedence over its message, “The Buried Giant” is first and foremost an allegory. The characters suffer as a result, but Ishiguro’s ultimate message is powerful and resonant enough that his book still merits a read. The questions Ishiguro poses are difficult but compelling: Is it preferable to live in a state of blissful ignorance, shielded from the cruel vagaries of the world? Is it right to seek happiness, even when it comes at the cost of awareness? Or is it imperative to confront past injustices, to demand consciousness and truth, even when that truth brings with it the possibility of a terrible reckoning? In this subtle morality tale, it is up to the reader to decide.

Internationally-acclaimed author David Vann’s new novel, “Aquarium,” offers a lovely and harrowing exploration of family, growing up, and the possibilities of forgiveness. 12-year-old Caitlin Thompson lives with her single mother in early 1990s Seattle. She visits the aquarium every day after school while waiting for her mother to return from her job at the city’s container port. Lonely, Caitlin befriends an elderly man at the aquarium, but his entrance into her life unleashes a storm of violence out of her family’s past. Caitlin’s narrative, told in a powerful yet believably youthful voice, is at times beautiful, at times searingly painful to read. It benefits from Vann’s original use of metaphor and spare prose. Vann’s unflinching gaze as it examines the barriers people create between themselves and the world.
Caitlin is an engaging narrator, and her reflections on childhood and adolescence are original and honest. During a fight with her mother midway through the novel, Caitlin thinks, “The worst part of childhood is not knowing that bad things pass, that time passes. A terrible moment in childhood hovers with a kind of eternity, unbearable.” Childhood is both idyll and nightmare for her, its joys new and intensely felt but its terrors equally so. Continuing this exploration of the paradoxes of childhood, Caitlin often seeks to understand her life through fairy tales. Locked out of her house one night, she compares her life to “some fairy tale on pause, the cottage door never opening. Characters gone to the wrong place, the wrong story. Little Red Riding Hood finding herself at the houses of the Three Pigs. A wolf out there somewhere.” In Vann’s hands, a device that might seem cliché becomes surprising and original. The comparisons make it clear that Caitlin’s story is no fairy tale, and part of the novel’s success lies in its ability to hold the reader suspended. Even a happy ending, in this book, is by no means certain.
Vann’s formal choices also enhance the credibility of Caitlin’s voice. Sentence fragments occur frequently, perhaps suggesting Caitlin’s immaturity as a writer, and they give the narrative the feel of a series of thoughts immediately recorded. Vann’s choice not to use quotation marks in dialogue, if occasionally confusing, also enhances the immediacy of the story. The reader seems to experience the action directly, along with Caitlin herself, rather than as a narrative mediated by literary conventions.
Perhaps the most striking formal aspect of Vann’s novel is the centrality of the motif of the aquarium. The aquarium, whose fish are described in kaleidoscopically beautiful detail, becomes the focal point of myriad metaphorical resonances. Caitlin describes the aquarium’s leafy seadragon thus: “a sea horse become a golden branch, sprouting leaves that might have been wings. If you looked at her long enough, you could imagine trees coming alive, entire forests waking up and drifting across the land, speaking in whispers. No trunk vertical but all gone horizontal, moving along on their branches, roots hung in the air. I wanted to live in that world.” In an almost Whitman-esque moment, the vast world becomes visible in a tiny animal. The fish becomes the basis for Caitlin’s reimagining of her whole universe, for impossible dreams and poetic visions.
Vann accompanies each description with a photographic illustration of the fish in question, an unusual though effective choice. The photographs certainly offer useful context for Caitlin’s words. At 12 years old, Caitlin is forced to confront physical and emotional dangers that many adults never have to face, and the unexpected appearance of pictures in a novel for adults reflects the novel’s larger exploration of innocence and the perilously permeable boundaries between childhood and adulthood.
The aquarium motif, developed from the novel’s first scene to its last, also takes on multiple layers of unexpected meaning as the narrative progresses. At different moments in the novel, the aquarium becomes a symbol of the safety of childhood, of the preservation of beauty in a ruined world, of the enduring presence of the past—as Caitlin tells her grandfather, jellyfish were among the first creatures on earth and may outlast us all—in a world with an uncertain future. Perhaps most importantly, the aquarium serves as a metaphor for the enclosed worlds each character in the novel is engaged in constructing, maintaining, or escaping: Caitlin’s mother’s isolation and aggression, the elderly man’s fear of revealing his identity to Caitlin despite his affection for her, Caitlin’s dreams of travelling outside the confines of Seattle. Through its exploration of the seemingly mundane environment of a local aquarium, the novel poses the frightening question of to what extent a person really can understand anyone else’s experience.
Vann refuses to provide his reader with an easy answer. Near the story’s end, Caitlin herself reflects, “Maybe this is as near as we can come to forgiveness. Not the past wiped away, nothing undone, but some willingness in the present, some recognition and embrace and slowing down.” This is as close as Vann comes to a solution, and his reluctance to embrace a fairy tale ending is the novel’s most marked strength. With Caitlin, Vann tells a moving story of a memorable protagonist. His novel, at once bleak and poetic, told in shimmering, original figurative language, succeeds in its uncompromising look at family relationships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Stranger,” which runs until March 7 in the Loeb Experimental Theater, opens with a scene familiar to any airplane traveler: Stiff, starched flight attendants recite safety regulations while two seatmates awkwardly exchange greetings. In this case, the seat mates are Hush (Dylan J. Peterson ’17), a bearded Bible-bearer, and an unnamed woman in sleek, dark clothes (Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15), who strike up a tentative conversation. Initially, “Stranger,” under the direction of Garrett C. Allen ’16, presents itself as a restrained, minimalist, psychological investigation into the pain of everyday life. What it eventually turns into, though, is significantly grimmer and more ambitious: a Hitchcockian spiral into madness, horror, and suffering. This escalation succeeds due to the cast’s tightly constructed and thoughtful delivery and effective technical execution. Strong acting helps the play deliver on its premise, and, despite momentary deficiencies of subtlety and a faintly inadequate ending, “Stranger” fascinates and unsettles.
At “Stranger’s” start, Hush shows no interest in interaction, but the woman beside him insistently manufactures a conversation. A nervous flyer, she seems to use frantic talking as a way to mitigate her fear, a tic that also manifests itself in her trembling body and fussing hands. She reveals personal secrets and asks searching questions; Hush begins to listen, then to speak. Over the next half hour or so, their pasts and inner lives begin to unfold in a kind of harmony of pain as each of them seeks a form of exorcism through one another.
The cast is tiny, consisting of only four people—apart from Peterson and Leimkuhler, Juliana N. Sass ’17 and Cole V. Edick ’17 play a progression of remembered people, emerging from the stage’s periphery and occasionally taking center stage. For the first half of the play, the set consists of two disembodied airplane chairs before a V-shaped room, which is kept in darkness. When Sass’s and Edick’s various characters appear, they step forward into the light and occasionally interact with Hush and the female passenger. Hush and the woman stare off into the middle distance, seeing them and not seeing them at the same time. It is a clever directorial choice and an excellent way to represent memory. Sass and Edick prove their acting skills in these parts, alternately portraying vapidity, terror, and humor when called upon to do so.
The two main actors give similarly strong performances. As the female passenger, Leimkuhler is fantastically compelling: She commands and manipulates audience attention with apparent ease and creates profound depth in her character through precise modulations of posture and voice. She expertly conveys a wide set of emotions ranging from scattered friendliness to glassy emptiness to giddy power to gut-wrenching rage; Leimkuhler somehow manages not only to make the individual feelings intensely credible but also to portray the swings in emotion believably.
As her foil, Peterson plays Hush well but with slightly less magnetism. By portraying the character as an indrawn, silent stoic, he relies almost entirely on slight expressions in his eyes; frequently, the subtlety pays off, and Hush reveals a flash of startling agony, longing, or rage. Sometimes, though, the technique is a little too subtle to be entirely effective. In one scene—that, without giving too much away, involves harrowing rage and insanity—Hush seems a little too subdued for the situation described and even borders on flat.
Together, though, Peterson and Leimkuhler create excellent chemistry. The complex tension between them remains detailed and palpable, even when only one of them is speaking: The listener always continues to act, reacting and responding in undistracting but crucial ways. Fortunately, the actors are given plenty of material with which to demonstrate their talents. The script explores major themes of power, gender, religion, and interpersonal connection, and the cast capitalizes on that base with nuance, intensity, and intelligence. In a particularly powerful moment, Leimkuhler quotes Genesis, emphasizing the story’s dark implications. “Always blame the woman,” she snarls. At moments, though, despite the actors’ strong performances, the play feels pedantically heavy-handed: The title is repeated one time too many, and a painted cross appears somewhat clumsily on a critical prop.
These slight issues become prominent in the play’s ending, which feels inadequate. It comes about abruptly, without a completely satisfactory resolution of plot or theme; it also presents a new component of the main relationship that seems more bizarre and sensationalist than credible. The denouement isn’t necessarily terrible, but it doesn’t do justice to the rest of the show’s heavy, loaded vividness. Although the ending is the stuff of mere melodrama, “Stranger” remains, for the most part, a wonderfully serious show.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Feet stomping, bracelets clinking, and skirts twirling, six young women take the stage of Agassiz Theater in front of a shouting, clapping audience. They are the experienced classical performers of Harvard Ghungroo, and they all boast years of training in South Asian dance. The audience members, who until now have been jumping from their seats and yelling words of encouragement without abandon, settle into a mesmerized silence as the dancers begin the night’s most intricate dance performance.
At Ghungroo, these trained classical dancers are the exception, not the rule. The show, organized by the Harvard South Asian Association, prides itself in accepting performers of all skill levels and cultures. Most of the dances are open to anyone who signs up, and the show is attended by a wide variety of students, parents—this year’s performances, in fact, coincided with Junior Parents’ Weekend—and administrators.
Running from Feb. 26 to 28 and produced by SAA co-presidents Jane Jacob ’16 and Saahil Siddoo ’16 and directed by Jesus E. Moran ’16, Mahi Mahmood ’16, and Suman Gunasekaran ’16, Ghungroo involved over 400 students and sold out all four performances. Three hours in duration, Ghungroo included nine major dances followed by a senior dance, interspersed with skits and lighthearted, somewhat raunchy dialogue from emcees Rishi Goel ’15 and Shehryar R. Sheikh ’15. During the intermission, the show’s producers displayed a tribute to the show’s 26-year history.
The show’s concluding senior dance boasted the largest and most diverse cast—one emcee joked that the participants were “culturally confused.”
“You meet so many people you wouldn’t otherwise meet [in Ghungroo],” says Hamna M. Nazir ’17, an inactive Crimson news editor and a performer in the Bhangra dance. “It draws a lot of different people from different backgrounds, different interests, different years.”
“It was a really diverse cast,” says Yasmin Moreno ’17, an inactive Crimson news editor, who attended to watch roommates who were involved in the showcase. “And it was cool to see how the show has grown and progressed to include more people since it began.”
Productions as large as Ghungroo typically require extensive preparation, but the bulk of the show’s dances came together within the span of a month. “Most of the dances practice for about once or twice a week for about two hours,” Nazir says. These short practice times, along with a large selection of dances, make Ghungroo accessible for many students.
Indeed, the mission of Ghungroo is not to search for skilled dancers: Some of this year’s participants had never danced in front of an audience before. Rather, the showcase celebrates South Asian culture and shares it with the wider university community. “It seemed like a really unifying and inclusive experience,” audience member Daniel A. Tartakovsky ’17 says. “I’d definitely perform in it next year.”
For South Asian students, Ghungroo provided an opportunity to reconnect with their heritage. “It’s a really great way to get in touch with your culture,” Nazir says. “I’m Pakistani-American and I’ve never done something like this before.” The show also served as a way to introduce those of other cultures to the South Asian tradition. At the end of the senior dance, performers of different backgrounds and ethnicities jumped and panted onstage, taking their bows to the sound of the audience cheering with equal enthusiasm.

“With the poem comes everything, every sound,” says spoken word artist Neiel Israel. “It all comes exactly the way it is.” These words reflect Israel’s thoughts on her art form—ideas that inspirits her work. In her performances, she seems to channel a force larger than herself, orating with an assured, unique energy. She has received increasing attention as an emerging voice in the lively Cambridge slam poetry scene and performed her most well known poem, “When a Black Man Walks,” at the March on Harvard demonstration last December. Israel sat down with The Crimson to discuss her creative philosophy and her work.
The Harvard Crimson: Your poems are quite closely aligned with ideas of social justice. Did you begin writing poetry with a socially conscious purpose, or did that focus come about more organically?
Neiel Israel: I don’t necessarily sit down to write a poem on purpose.… I have never been that kind of poet. It doesn’t mean it won’t change, but I respect the idea.… Sometimes when the idea comes, I’ll sit with it who knows how long—it could be a week, a month, who knows—but when it comes it generally just comes straight through for me. So I suppose that’s organic.… I wait for the idea, and when it comes I take full advantage. Maybe I could even say, honestly, I obey and write it down.
THC: When researching you, I came across a video in which a man said seeing you perform made him feel the proudest he’d ever been to be a black man.
NI: Oh, wow.
THC: And a lot of what strikes me about your poetry is that it’s very loving. How important is it to you that love comes through in your poetry?
NI: Oh, that’s very important. That’s me embracing the responsibility of being a poet, because...I’m required or responsible to write the poems that I need to write in my life. So it is love. When I was a child—I’m a larger child now, an older child—but when I was a younger child people would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up. And I’d always say a poet. I knew that I was a poet at 6...and people, even the ones that loved me the most would always shoot that idea down. Uproot it even before it could grow. So growing in the world as an artist, or a poet even, was very difficult for me because people would chop it down. They would say things like, “You’ll starve to death,” or “You’ll die. How’re you gonna pay your rent?”.... Now I don’t let anything get in the way of that. I don’t let doubt...affect me.
So I think because of that there is a love, and I think I have to hold it because I know that’s what I am. And recently I’ve been completely overjoyed, just overjoyed, trying not to be overwhelmed with the joy of being a poet.... There would have to be love in it, because without poetry, honestly, I really...have nothing.... And it feels good [to write poetry]. I’m teaching students now.… I kind of get to go and say to people, “Go forth and write poetry!” which is what I didn’t necessarily have growing up. There were no poets that came to my school on...career day, whatever that is. And what a sad thing that is, if that’s who and what you are.... So now I get to share and give what I so desperately needed as a creative intellectual, as a poet, as a child.... What I like is that I can be somewhat of a liaison for people who are not sure of their own tongue, who are afraid to use their own words and of what might happen using those words or what might not happen using those words. But I like that I’m there as a witness that it’s okay to be poetic, to write poems, to create.

Daniel Handler chuckles as he gestures to the iPhone recording his voice. “It’s interesting that we’re recording the interview on a smartphone,” he says. Handler, who wrote the children’s series “All The Wrong Questions” and the ever-popular “A Series of Unfortunate Events” under the pseudonym of Lemony Snicket, is talking about feelings of claustrophobia associated with contemporary technology. He sits wearing a suit and tie in the anteroom of the First Parish Church in Cambridge, shortly before his Feb. 20 Harvard Book Store discussion of his new adult novel “We Are Pirates.”
The presence of the blinking iPhone brings Handler’s novel to mind. For Gwen Needle, the 14-year-old protagonist of “We Are Pirates,” contemporary connectivity’s frustrating role in limiting adolescent freedom makes the pirate’s life appealing. Handler reveals that Gwen’s anguish is inspired by real conversations he had at the dawn of the iPhone age. “I was meeting all of these teenagers because of the Snicket books who had all been given smartphones,” he says. “I’d say, ‘Oh, you must love that because certainly all of the media I see is about the kids digging their new smartphones. A girl said to me, ‘I can never call my parents and be somewhere other than where I say I am,’” Handler recounts.
The disparity between Handler’s own adolescence, which he says was entirely based on lying to his parents, and those of today’s online youths made Handler want to explore teenage escape. Although Gwen’s parents play a large role in the book, Handler focused almost exclusively on his younger character in his interview and reading. During the reading, Handler presented a scene in which Gwen, after stealing from a drug store, becomes a “buddy” for dementia patient Errol. As the two lost souls began to bond over pirate literature, Handler flipped forward in the book to a scene in which Gwen and Errol have already taken to the high seas (San Francisco Bay) to find treasure. The audience laughed heartily at Handler’s rendition of the pirates’ pathetic theft of a yacht.
While Handler is quick to critique cell phones—he doesn’t own one—he treads more lightly on the subject of gentrification in San Francisco. The book references absurd housing prices, but Handler isn’t convinced that his book’s setting, which is also his own lifelong home, is losing its culture. “San Francisco is always in flux,” he says. “Everything is changing and nothing is changing.” He imbues his text with a dual vision of 19th century Barbary Coast San Francisco as well as its current tech-infused incarnation. “I hope it realizes both aspects of the city—that you can go to a neighborhood that will look exactly the same from 1954 and then go to a neighborhood that is completely transformed as of two weeks ago,” he says.
As in “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” Handler employs a nameless narrator in “We Are Pirates.” While it is clear that the chronicler has met the Needle family, the voice also admits to inventing plot elements and takes issue with Gwen’s father’s occasional lack of political correctness. While Handler is known for mysterious and complex narrative schemes, his decision to go for ambiguity in “We Are Pirates” came from within the pirate genre. “I was reading a lot of 19th century literature—you know, a lot of the classic swashbuckling literature—and a lot of them use a narrator to get into the story,” he says. Taking on a hardened British accent, he imitates one of these framing figures: “I was walking down the street and I found this manuscript…here it is!”
At the reading, Handler was only sometimes the center of attention. As part of his ongoing championing of poetry, he decided to co-host the event with Boston poets Janaka Stucky, the founder of the Black Ocean press, and Elisa Gabbert. After giving a brief humorous introduction about the Northeast’s particularly brutal February, Handler deferred to the poets and sat, laughing and nodding, while they presented their work. Stucky delivered a love meditation around the phrase “Thus I perish in amazement” while Gabbert shared part of a manuscript inspired by the 1996 Wallace Shawn play “The Designated Mourner.”
The goodwill and literary experimentation in First Parish on Friday suggests that Handler, who  has been under scrutiny since his controversial comments at the National Book Awards in November, is anything but jaded. “I didn’t know how this tour was going to go, between the weather and the profile of the book,” Handler says. “So my thinking was: If a lot of people come, then a lot of people get to hear these great poets. And if nobody comes, instead of feeling like a failure by myself I can go and get drunk with the other poets.”

“Separate” is too easily read as a dirty word within our contemporary mode of moral thinking. We have come to inhabit a multicultural pluralism sharing the whitewashed bed of liberalism. But self-defined “separatism” is a thing of value. It gets erased in the language we use to talk about integration and desegregation, of diversity as inherently valuable. That same particularity of liberalism perpetuates the constant drive toward allyship.
What defines allyship is that it stands beside and with a movement that has had the chance to outline its own body, if only in chalk, on its own terms. The debate that takes place in a movement’s action and conversation is the debate among the people concerned, among the people who are being spoken of. There is no “speaking for” in an act of allyship, though there may be amplifying and an interrogation of the particular ways that we can use our positions of privilege to mobilize and enact change. But you do not put an army of cis men at the vanguard of a movement for gender justice. You do not situate a collective of white people at the head of a movement for racial liberation.
The power of a separate space comes from our right to define it ourselves. This is not to say that segregated spaces are inherently powerful because of the identity-affinity of those who inhabit them. Rather, the ability to define and claim a space for a collective or an individual that is not accorded a privileged position—or the ability to be the unmarked category in society (i.e. middle class/upper class, educated, white, male, cis-gender, hetero)—is important. Essential. Something about having that space is a crucial part of self-definition and realization. Where else will the terms of any revolution be decided?
Probably not at Harvard. Probably not in marble halls of power and the ivory tower. What are the tools we can craft that may be of use? For one, we can attempt to change the environment of a “liberal” society imbued with a forceful drive towards multiculturalism that too easily becomes an equally coercive demand for assimilation. We can stop talking about separatism as though it is a thing that white supremacists invented and instead talk about how, in the assertion of affinity groups, their separate space in the world will be a place to define their own speech acts, their own aims, their own methods.
Wars are not fought without allies, but we enter battles for justice from a position that has been defined by power structures aligned across variant metrics. The way difference is inscribed on our bodies and then arranged within various hierarchies has put each of us in a position of partial perspective. But this standpoint is a significant epistemic place from which to come. It is essential to understand the immense power and the clarity of such a point of view, limited though each of us is. No one of us has the view from nowhere, the putative objectivity our science would love to claim. It is equally vital to be able to recognize the ground on which we stand (and pontificate) as individuals, not just the knowledge we create from there. What placed us here? Who is sharing the ground with us? We should feel able to place a stake in that ground under our feet, because, until we can stake a point of beginning, how can we move? That shared ground, defined as our own, is the separate space that is not imposed as a form of segregation but is claimed in a profound act of subjecthood. This is the ground fecund with the potential for generative discourse that we must be allowed to sow, and where we can put up a sign that says, this is who I need to engage in conversation—and this is who, for an intentional moment, I need a break from being forced to involve.

If a character wishes to survive the dark, stormy, often blood-splattered world of horror cinema, it is imperative that he or she follow a strict set of guidelines. First: When stalked by someone with murderous intentions, splitting up is always a bad idea. Second: Having sex practically ensures an untimely demise. And, most notably, third: Attempting to raise something from the dead always leads to disaster. Of course, horror film characters will not abide by these rules as they inevitably prove themselves to be irrational, impetuous, and unforgivably dumb; those in David Gelb’s supernatural-themed misfire “The Lazarus Effect” are no different. Unfortunately, when a “scary” movie manages to lack both relatable protagonists and any semblance of terror, it elevates itself to a profound level of awfulness. Despite boasting an A-list cast and the kernel of an engaging premise, “The Lazarus Effect” succumbs to its hapless direction, stilted dialogue, and mind-numbing predictability.
From the film’s shaky-camera opening, its prognosis is grim: Keen on laughing in God’s face, a gang of Berkeley researchers decide to experiment with reanimating dead animals using a lab-made elixir known as the Lazarus Serum. The group, led by soon-to-be-married Frank (Mark Duplass) and Zoe (Olivia Wilde), manages to revive a dog (and, logically, keep him as a pet) before the university shuts down all further procedures. After Zoe bites the dust in an ill-fated attempt to continue her research, Frank, who has obviously never read any Mary Shelley or seen any horror movie ever, decides to resurrect his lost love. Bad move, Frank: Zoe returns, albeit as an omnipotent, possibly demonic telepath, hellbent on killing her colleagues for no apparent reason. Everything is ridiculous, and nothing is as it should be.
Presumably, this is when David Gelb intended for “The Lazarus Effect” to become scary. But Gelb, director of the poignant, visually sumptuous documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” (2011), packs his first foray into scripted film with choices that drain suspense out of inherently frightening material. Particularly in the lumbering first half, Gelb strings together a series of half-hearted stabs at developing character relationships and advancing the tenuous storyline. However, nearly every scene seems to end prematurely. The film jumps from one to the next with little to no resolution or explanation. Even worse, the camera lingers for what feels like an eternity on every impending jump-scare, rendering each more dull than the next. This utter lack of surprises, coupled with the myriad ungraceful uses of tired horror tropes—creaky doors, flashing lights, ominous hallways—leaves the viewer to wallow in boredom for much of the film.
Additionally, screenwriters Luke Dawson and Jeremy Slater have crafted a Frankenstein’s monster of scripts by stitching together the leftover ideas from other supernatural horror and sci-fi flicks. As a result, the plot and dialogue reek of confusion and cliché. The writers introduce a plethora of side-stories and concepts—a mysterious company intent on stealing lab work, the intrinsic connection between science and religion, a possible love triangle—that are dropped mere minutes after introduction. The dialogue just worsens the situation. One of the more tragic displays of cinematic writing comes halfway through the film: After reuniting with his wife, Frank whispers, “I thought I’d lost you.” “You did,” Zoe responds. “But… I didn’t,” says Frank, thus concluding the most emotionally charged exchange of the film. That Duplass and Wilde can continually deliver line after line of such stilted conversation without laughing or vomiting is truly a testament to their abilities as actors.
“The Lazarus Effect” is essentially an 80-minute stream of missed opportunities and half-baked subplots. The whole production rings so egregiously trite and predictable that Relativity Media could have marketed it as a dark comedy, except the film also happens to be devoid of laughs or joy. Ironically, although “The Lazarus Effect” finished filming over a year ago, it feels rushed: At times, with its unwavering reliance on hackneyed visuals and muddled plot points, it resembles the product of a high school film class. But the most baffling aspect of the movie is not its absence of scares or wan examination of morality; rather, it is how such a talented group of actors agreed to saddle themselves with this material. In some ways, “The Lazarus Effect” is markedly similar to Frank and Zoe’s pet zombie-dog, aside from a key difference—at no point does the film spring back to life. Indeed, it was never alive to begin with.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, while talking with my academic adviser, I learned that many freshmen advisers had recently attended a meeting to discuss administrative concerns with the blocking process. One major concern was the excess of blocking misconceptions that arises every year, so advisers were urged to clarify misunderstandings with their advisees. However, for many freshmen, the past weeks have nevertheless been characterized by confusion and speculation, spurred on by a lack of information from the administration.
Blocking, despite being a signature (and, in my opinion, invaluable) aspect of the Harvard experience, is inherently prone to tension—people have multiple groups of friends, and narrowing them down to eight or so people can be challenging and stressful. However, the process becomes even more complicated when there is contradictory information circulating about. I have encountered groups that are banking on gender-neutral housing. I have also talked to many people who think that blocking is equivalent to rooming (not true either). I even know people who are not linking because they think that it means they will be assigned to the Quad (clearly false). How are we supposed to make the right decisions when we are not even sure of how it all works?
The truth is that the vast majority of our information on blocking comes from our peers, many of whom are also freshman. During the first weeks of the semester, when blocking was discussed at practically every meal, I saw a widespread case of blind leading the blind. Lacking any formal communication from the administration regarding the specifics of the blocking process, many anxious freshmen spread misinformation, making others unsure of what type of group would be best for them. Is there any correlation between small groups and single rooms? Between big groups and the Quad? Are co-ed groups guaranteed gender-neutral housing? Will blockmates of the same gender be suite mates? Is there an alternative option to Houses? These are the types of questions that circulated around Annenberg Hall, many times answered by wild guesses of uninformed freshmen.
Now, attempts have been made to quell freshmen anxieties. In the past couple weeks all freshmen entryways have hosted a study break devoted to the blocking process, but, for a couple of reasons, this attempt has not been enough. First, many students can’t attend study breaks due to extracurricular commitments. Second, this attempt came very late in the process, when many freshmen had already formed groups and had already internalized much of the misinformation that had circulated, uncorrected, for many weeks. Concrete information on the process could have been of great help if it had been disseminated earlier and to everyone in the freshmen class.
I find it odd that even though the administration knows that there are misunderstandings about blocking among the freshmen—to a point, according to my advisor, where it even held an advisor meeting that addressed them—neither the Freshmen Dean’s Office nor the Office of Student Life sent out an email to the freshmen to clarify the process. The deadline to enter the lottery is this Wednesday, but not a single official email regarding the blocking process appeared in my inbox. Many freshmen sorted out questions by seeking the help of proctors, academic advisers and Peer Advising Fellows, but others, lacking information from one centralized source, simply built their groups on misconceptions.
Like most of my peers, I cannot wait for housing day. I also appreciate that Harvard gives us the opportunity to choose who will live with us the rest of our college years. But if Harvard wants to give us the responsibility of deciding who we will spend the rest of college with, it should also give us the information needed to make a well-informed decision.

Last Monday, Harvard announced that former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 was would be the speaker at Harvard’s 364th Commencement on May 28. We believe the decision to have Governor Patrick address the Class of 2015 is a good one. As governor, Patrick served the Commonwealth well, and his legacy and views remain important to Massachusetts, and therefore to Harvard. As an extraordinary alumnus with a distinguished record of public service, he will certainly have valuable advice to share with the graduating class.
A graduate of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Patrick was elected Massachusetts' first African-American governor. He broke new ground with his eight years of service, showing uncommon leadership on issues of inclusion, like gay marriage, from the beginning of his time in office. To a large extent, Patrick represents the best of what Harvard aims for its students to become. Coming from a low-income background, the governor succeeded at the College and Harvard Law School, going on to dedicate the prime of his career to serving others. As Harvard seeks to increase the diversity of each class, alumni like Patrick remind us of the success that every person is capable of attaining with hard work. He will also likely have nuanced perspectives on the Harvard experience and its role in public service
Patrick is also less controversial than previous commencement speaker choices, though we hope that this was not a factor in the decision. There certainly can be value in having someone who stirs up controversy on campus or does not pander to our general mode of thinking. In short, it can be valuable to hear from a speaker even if he or she engenders contention. Although some found the decision to invite Michael R. Bloomberg, a 1966 alumnus of the Business School, to speak at Commencement particularly controversial, his selection was appropriate because of his distinguished record as a successful businessman and as Mayor of New York City. Similarly, Patrick is an appropriate choice to give the address this year because of his record of service to the Commonwealth.
The choice of a Commencement speaker is not about controversy for the sake of controversy, yet neither is it about picking an uncontroversial option for the sake of unity. Rather, speakers should be chosen based on who can most effectively address the class and from whose personal experiences graduating seniors can gain the most insight. As an alumnus who has just finished an eventful and historic eight-year term as Massachusetts’ Governor, Deval Patrick is the right man at the right time.  Finally and most importantly, Commencement is about the graduates. We believe that Patrick will serve them well.

For about three months, I’ve been gnawing on a Jezebel think piece entitled “I Don’t Know What to Do With Good White People.” When the piece first appeared in my news feed, I instinctively recoiled. Like the author, Brit Bennett, I owe much of my extraordinary good fortune to white people who have reached beyond their comfort zone to defend my rights and my interests. My white friends are empathetic, deeply mindful and self-critical as a rule. Thus, when I read the article’s title, I was eager to dismiss it. I already knew what to do with good white people. I would hold them close and be grateful for their existence.
Yet the mark of a good think piece is that it sticks with you, even when you disagree with it. It asks questions that can’t be dismissed out of hand. While the intentions of white people have improved dramatically over the past half-century, outcomes have not kept pace. Black people continue to face discrimination in policing, hiring, housing, and healthcare. As Bennett puts it, “What good are your good intentions if they kill us?”
One reaction to the dissonance between racial attitudes and racial outcomes has been growing distrust on the part of minorities. According to Bennett’s mother, "It was a lot simpler in the rural South…White people let you know right away where you stood." Social justice activists are increasingly skeptical of their white allies, ready to leap on stray problematic comments as “proof” of their allies’ true motives. While this reaction is understandable, it misses the broader problems of systemic racism by focusing too narrowly on individuals. Having recognized that good intentions are not enough, it is surprising that many activists continue to focus their energies on consciousness raising and vigilance at the personal level. We need to create environments where goodness can flourish and where unconscious biases do not have the opportunity to take root.
Much of this transformation needs to take place on the level of policy. Past efforts to address gender discrimination at Harvard Business School and the effect of stereotype threat on standardized testing have shown that relatively small interventions can have disproportionately large effects on outcomes. Meanwhile, not enough research has been done on the specific initiatives that may improve racial outcomes. Organizations like the Center for Policing Equity and Solving Disparities are addressing this knowledge gap in the fields of policing and healthcare to develop solutions that can shape a better culture. Those of us who hope to improve our culture should do the same in our organizational spaces. It is not enough to merely talk about the need for diversity and inclusion— campuses need to develop policies to ensure these norms are met, and most importantly, they need to develop tools to measure outcomes over time. Harvard’s newly announced sexual assault climate survey is a great model for racial justice activism. The more we know about racial outcomes, the better we can assess our efforts to combat discrimination.
While we work to improve racial outcomes in our spaces, we also must work to develop a sustainable culture around activism. While I appreciate Bennett’s piece for the questions it raises, the tone and title of the piece were clearly designed to provoke and alienate white allies. I am especially troubled by Bennett’s criticism of white people who “expect to be rewarded for their decency.” The very reason that we engage in activism, especially when it is risky or unpleasant, is because we hope to be rewarded, whether in the form of accolades, future benefits, or divine favor.
Given the right incentives, even the most timid ally can be emboldened to challenge systems of oppression. Given the wrong ones, even committed radicals soon burn out. Because fighting for change offers so little in the way of financial and social security, it is imperative that we create communities that nourish and support this work—places where doing good feels good.
“Good” white people are a key resource in the fight for racial equality. We should work to create environments where they can stay that way.

UPDATED: March 2, 2015, at 10:53 p.m.
The New York City juice vendor Liquiteria will open in Harvard Square this spring at the former site of The Body Shop on Massachusetts Avenue.
In addition to its namesake selection of juices and smoothies, Liquiteria also sells salads, entrees, snacks and desserts. The chain caters to a health-conscious clientele, and, as stated on its website, has designed its menu “to ensure that you don’t just survive, you thrive.”
Founded in 1996, Liquiteria currently operates five stores in Manhattan. The Harvard Square location will be the company’s first store outside of New York.
“We decided that the Boston area would be the best place to expand, and when our team saw that there was a Harvard Square opening, it was the obvious choice," said Brett Williams, Liquiteria’s vice president of business development.
He said that Liquiteria was lucky to find a well-situated location in the Square just as it was looking to branch out.
Many students were not aware of Liquiteria’s arrival to the Square but expressed interest in the coming opening.
“I think a place like that will find a good home here, “ L. Hikari Sorensen ’18 said. Sorensen added that, in her view, Liquiteria was breaking into a relatively untapped market.
“Juice bars are popular among young people, and there’s not too many around here.”
Speaking of Liquiteria's long-term plans, Williams said that the performance of the Harvard Square location will determine whether the company expands in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Barnes and Noble’s recent announcement that the company would divide its education and retail divisions into two separate publicly traded companies will not affect operations at The Harvard Coop, which is managed by Barnes and Noble.
General Manager of the Coop Allan E. Powell wrote in an emailed statement that, despite Barnes and Noble’s announcement, the management of the store would remain intact.
“With the recent announcement to spin off the College Store Division as a publicly traded company, we again do not expect any impact on our agreement,” Powell wrote. “The management of the College Division will remain in place so we do not expect to see any changes from current day to day operations.”
According to Powell, corporate changes like these are not new for Barnes and Noble. He added that, in Barnes and Noble’s 20-year tenure managing the Coop, changes in corporate structure have not substantially affected the store’s day-to-day operations.
“When we began our relationship in 1995, the College Store Division was a wholly owned subsidiary of B&N and was operated independent of B&N Inc.” Powell wrote. “In recent years, The College Store Division [was sold] to B&N Inc. When that occurred, the Coop saw no change in operations or the overall relationship.”
Barnes and Noble took over operations at The Coop in 1995, when an especially difficult financial year hit The Coop with a $200,000 deficit.
Barnes and Noble now operates 714 campus bookstores nationwide. It has announced that the separation of its education and retail divisions should be completed by August 2015.

Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study has drawn in $42 million in gifts and pledges towards its capital campaign goal of $70 million, according to Radcliffe spokesperson Alison Franklin.
This figure, reaching the 60 percent threshold of the Institute’s fundraising target, comes from more than 6,000 contributing households. When the Radcliffe Institute publicly launched its fundraising efforts in October, $26 million had already been raised.
Several notable gifts have contributed to the progress of the campaign so far, including the Johnson-Kulukundis family’s $10 million gift toward Radcliffe and the arts at Harvard in September 2014. Earlier, long-time University donor and co-chair of the Radcliffe campaign Sidney R. Knafel created a $10.5 million fund in 2013 in support of Radcliffe’s interdisciplinary programming and public engagement.
"The success of The Radcliffe Campaign thus far is testament to the broad support we enjoy, including Radcliffe College alumnae, Harvard alumni, Institute fellows, student researchers, and even members of the general public who attend our events," Dean Lizabeth Cohen wrote in an emailed statement.  "We're proud not only of the progress of the campaign, but also of the range of supporters who recognize what the Radcliffe Institute contributes to intellectual life at the University and beyond."
The Radcliffe Institute was founded in 1999, following the merger of the University and Radcliffe College. The Institute hosts an annual fellowship program for artists and scholars, and also funds the work of researchers both within and outside of Harvard.
The money fundraised in the capital campaign will contribute to further growth among the Institute’s core programs like the Fellows Program, Franklin said. Other focuses of the capital campaign include funding undergraduate-fellow collaborative research under Radcliffe Research Partners, supporting the Schlesinger Library’s work with women’s history in America and with the digitization of crucial collections, and increasing funding for interdisciplinary connections with scholars across academic fields within the Academic Ventures program.
Radcliffe’s target for the campaign makes up a little more than one percent of the University-wide $6.5 billion campaign, only exceeding the goals of the Dental School and the Divinity School at $8 million and $50 million, respectively. As of June 2014, the Business School raised at least $721 million, more than 70 percent of its $1 billion goal, and the Kennedy School recently passed the three-quarters mark of its $500 million goal.

Following the Federal Communication Commission's decision to classify the internet as a telecommunications service, thereby allowing the government to regulate it as a utility, Harvard professors praised the ruling considered a victory for net neutrality proponents.
FCC Chairman Thomas E. Wheeler announced last Thursday that the independent body voted 3-2 in favor of net neutrality, which would prohibit internet service providers from differentiating the speed and quality of the service according to their customers’ ability to pay.
Several Harvard faculty members and other affiliates said the ruling largely benefited consumers and their access to the internet.
“Over the long term, these actions may help to ensure that there will be choices for connectivity, and that when you're connected, you don't see that access being cajoled in one direction or another depending on the ISPs' business deals,” wrote Jonathan L. Zittrain, faculty director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, in an email.
Roger G. Zou ’17, president of the Harvard Computer Society, said that the ruling would enable start-ups to “make huge plays in the market” and deliver their products via the internet.
“We think that it will allow a good product to stand on its own,” Zou added.
However, other professors raised concerns that the decision could potentially decrease internet service providers’ profits and discourage them from building internet infrastructure.
“The United States is not exactly a global leader in providing high speed internet to the entire country. We’re kind of a lagger, actually,” Matthew A. Baum, a Kennedy School professor of global communications, said. “[This ruling] could make us, in one respect, possibly more of a lagger.”
At the same time, Alex S. Jones, Director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, noted that internet service providers were not expanding infrastructure prior to the ruling.
“Have you ever asked yourself why, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we don’t have FIOS? FIOS is Verizon’s top of the line cable access,” Jones said. “We don’t have it because they don’t want to spend the money to run the cable...Saying that they’re going to be hampered in doing [infrastructure] is moot because they’re not doing it anyway.”
Beyond the decision’s positive impact on consumers, faculty members marked the political significance that the decision came into fruition. Yochai Benkler, Berkman Center faculty co-director and Law School professor, acknowledged that successful grassroots movements put pressure on legislators.
“[The ruling is] a moment that can give us hope that even in the presence of enormous amounts of money in politics and one of the worst revolving door environments in Washington, people can still organize themselves to force politicians to do the right thing,” Benkler wrote in an email.
Although supportive of the new regulations, several professors noted that they could be overturned by future administrations.
“The FCC has become pretty politicized. Right now you have a Democratic appointee in charge. That could change with the next president,” Baum said. “The politics of this are still very uncertain.”

Following controversy surrounding two Law School student groups’ recent decision to revoke an honor from Robin Steinberg, a New York City public defender, other students have begun planning to bring Steinberg to campus anyway, according to Rebecca N. Chapman, a third-year Law student involved in the planning.
Steinberg, the executive director of the non-profit public defense service the Bronx Defenders, was initially slated to be honored as part of International Women’s Day, an annual event at the Law School that celebrates women in the legal profession.
The two groups that organize the event, the Women’s Law Association and the Law and International Development Society, rescinded the recognition in February amid controversy over Steinberg’s role in an inflammatory YouTube video titled “Hands Up.”
The video, which some say endorses violence against white police officers in retribution for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, features two attorneys from the Bronx Defenders. Steinberg came under criticism for not reviewing the lyrics of the video before allowing her employees to appear in it; following a New York City investigation, Steinberg, who does not appear in the video, was suspended from her job for 60 days without pay.
The decision to revoke Steinberg’s honor has prompted outcry from members of the Law School community. Now, there is action to bring her to campus in another capacity and honor her work as a public defender. On Feb. 19, more than 180 students, staff, and alumni of the Law School, including Chapman, signed a letter published in both The Crimson and the Harvard Law Record denouncing the decision to revoke Steinberg’s honor and extending their “own invitation to Ms. Steinberg to speak at HLS.”
According to Chapman, students have started taking steps to follow up, though she would not yet specify the details of Steinberg’s potential on-campus appearance.
Other groups of Law students and administrators also spoke publicly about the controversy. On Feb. 20, a group of alumnae released a letter criticizing the decision, and, on Feb. 24, members of the WLA spoke out against what they called the undemocratic decision-making process in an Op-Ed published in the Law Record. The leadership of the Women’s Law Association circulated a response to some of these criticisms to the entire Law School student body, according to Chapman. In the expanded response, the WLA cited influence from Law School administrators and concerns about inciting protests from police organizations as their reasons for not honoring Steinberg.

Cambridge has again received the highest rating, AAA, from all three major U.S. credit rating agencies. It is one of only 34 municipalities across the country to do so this year and has received AAA rating from the three agencies since 1999.
The reports credit a tax base anchored by the presence of Harvard and MIT as one of the reasons for Cambridge’s strong finances.
The agencies assigned a AAA score for all outstanding long-term government debt as well as another $75.7 million of new municipal bonds for 2015. The reports judged Cambridge to be likely to repay its loans due to its financial stability. Its strong finances mean that the city can issue bonds with lower interest rates.
According to Cambridge city manager Richard C. Rossi, the money is earmarked for infrastructure development. He said the majority of it will go to the reconstruction of Martin Luther King Elementary School as well as of the sewer system. The bonds will also fund smaller projects such as open space and improvements to municipal buildings.
Cambridge City Councilor Marc C. McGovern said that municipal projects such as these are viable because of the low borrowing costs that result from having such a consistently high credit rating.
“The reason we can put extra money into our food pantries, extra money into our schools, extra money into all of the services that we offer in this city, the reason we can do that is because of our financial stability, is because of the industry we have here, is because of our AAA bond rating,” he said.
Rossi said that the continued AAA ratings “gives people confidence that this is a good community to work in, to live in, to invest in. It’s a whole picture about a community.”
According to the Moody’s report, the presence of Harvard and MIT contributes significantly to the city’s continued economic stability. It stated that the the two institutions directly employ almost 20,000 full-time workers, as well as attracting biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and life sciences firms.
Although Harvard and MIT, as non-profit universities, do not pay property taxes, they still make voluntary payments to the city. The report states that payments from tax-exempt institutions are financing approximately $5.8 million, or 1.1 percent, of the city’s budget for the 2015 fiscal year.
Thomas J. Lucey, the University’s director of government and community relations, said that the city is one of the most financially secure communities in the commonwealth.
“It is a city that benefits from a very robust economy, in which Harvard and MIT are really the core,” he said. “It is a very financially stable [city]...Other cities and towns look at Cambridge with a lot of envy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If approved, new federal legislation on sexual violence introduced in the United States Senate last week could change the way the University reports, advises, and assesses its approach to cases of alleged sexual violence.
Last Thursday, a bipartisan group of 12 senators introduced a modified version of the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, a bill that seeks to regulate how colleges and universities handle sexual assault. Legislators introduced a previous iteration of the bill last July that was not enacted.
The newest version of the bill leaves many of its earlier mandates in tact, such as requirements for specific training of personnel involved in disciplinary processes. The updated version of the bill from last week, however, requests that colleges conduct campus climate surveys once every two years, instead of once every year, as previously required by the bill. Last week’s version also lays out several new standards for confidential advisers, university affiliates who are designated point people to provide advice and support to alleged victims of sexual harassment.
In addition, the legislation could change how the federal government fines institutions for non-compliance with federal regulations. It would allow the government to fine the institution up to 1 percent of its total operating budget for violating requirements of the bill. Non-compliance with Title IX, a federal anti-sex discrimination law, already risks the loss of federal funding.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said the bill, although still subject to change, could mean substantial changes for colleges if it is enacted, especially for larger institutions including Harvard.
“Complex schools with big budgets are definitely going to be very aware of these changes,”  Lake said. “No question that it’s going to have an impact on those places.”
Harvard’s Title IX regulations could be in tension with the timeframe by which the bill would require schools to notify students accused of violating their sexual harassment policies and the totality of statistics it requests that schools release. Whether the bill would have an impact on the level of consistency of Harvard’s disciplinary procedures across its schools and campuses remains in question.
The legislation as currently proposed would require that institutions notify both complainants and respondents within 24 hours of administrators’ decision “to proceed with an institutional disciplinary process” and after they have determined which disciplinary sanctions, if any, they will hand down.
According to Harvard’s centralized sexual harassment procedures, an investigative team will notify both parties following a decision to investigate a case of alleged sexual harassment, but the regulations do not stipulate a specific time frame. Under the the central procedures, individual schools hand down sanctions if one of their students is found in violation of Harvard’s central policy, and the central procedures require that those schools “notify the parties as appropriate.”
Tania deLuzuriaga, a University spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement that the University is monitoring the legislation “closely,” but did not respond directly to questions about specific points of possible tension between Harvard’s policy and the bill. University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides declined to comment further.
By amending the Clery Act, the legislation could also require Harvard, like other institutions, to publish additional statistics relating to students who report incidents to Title IX coordinators. The College’s Administrative Board currently releases figures on the outcomes of disciplinary cases, including those involving sexual misconduct, but those statistics do not specify how many students reported such instances without pursuing formal or informal complaints.
The bill also includes a mandate for a “uniform process (for each campus of the institution) for student disciplinary proceedings relating to any claims of sexual violence against a student who attends the institution.” According to Lake, the potential ramifications for Harvard and other universities or university systems of this section of the legislation remain unclear. In the past, Lake said, the Department of Education has used language specifying consistency rather than mandating a strict, singular process.
“To some extent, the interpretations of this will have to duke it out even after Congress acts, assuming they pass it in the form that it’s currently in,” Lake said.
Harvard currently employs a University-wide sexual harassment policy that applies to all faculty, students, and staff. A single set of Title IX procedures, similarly, currently governs the investigation of all complaints filed against students across the University’s schools, although Harvard Law School has moved to depart from them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 17, 2015, at 1:36 a.m.
The Undergraduate Council launched its gender equality campaign Side by Side on Monday evening with a panel discussion featuring former Miss America pageant winner Nina Davuluri, former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, and several Harvard affiliates.
Throughout the event, panelists shared several personal recollections of their own difficulties with regards to gender and gender norms.
Davuluri said that after being named Miss America, she was not taken seriously by nonprofit foundation leaders she interacted with because of stereotypes surrounding her gender and the pageant.
She recalled an instance in which an older Indian gentleman asked her “So Nina, can you cook?”
Sharing his own experiences with gender norms, local venture capitalist and event panelist Hugo Van Vuuren ’07 discussed the challenges of growing up in a South African society that promoted traditional masculine stereotypes.
“You grew up playing rugby and the ideas of what it means to be a man and what it means to be respected both in the classroom and at home and on the sporting field suffer under the influence of that sport,” Van Vuuren said. “And then growing up and realizing that some of these things that go hand in hand in that sport, altruism, aggression, and a lot of unhealthy behavior, really ruin society.”
Van Vuuren later added that rugby can also promote healthy values that should be amplified.
Panelist and Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life Van Bailey also provided perspective on the effects of gender norms, commenting on his experiences as a homeless youth. He said it was especially difficult as a transgender individual, citing gendered facilities and expectations to participate in certain gender-based programming.
Bailey also stressed the importance of the utilization of preferred gender pronouns in everyday conversations.
Van Vuuren added that the Harvard community “refreshes itself every three years” and that, as a result, a campus-wide adoption of the usage of preferred gender pronouns is not as difficult as it might seem.
Following the event, UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 said that the launch was a good start but that he hopes it will act as a jumping board that begins conversation about gender on campus.
Several students in attendance for the event shared their thoughts on the Side by Side launch.
“As one of the only people on campus that identifies as transfeminine I’m really interested to hear everyone’s perspectives on how gender discrimination affects all genders,” W. Powell Eddins ’16 said.
For others, the event’s keynote speaker was a reason to attend.
“I wanted to come out to support the campaign and also to hear Nina Davuluri speak,” Gunjari Raychaudhuri ’17 said.
Former Speaker of the New York City Council Christine Quinn, a resident fellow at the Institute of Politics this spring, was scheduled to speak but was not able to attend because of a family emergency, according to Michelle S. Lee ’16, an inactive Crimson editor and UC representative.

“Three-peat, three-peat!”
That was the chant that rang throughout the Gordon Indoor Track, as the Harvard women’s track and field co-captains Erika Veidis and Ashley Collinsworth brought back the team’s winning trophy for the third year in a row.
Competing at home in front of a packed building, the women were able to defend their title for the second year in a row and claim the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships for the fifth time in program history. The Crimson finished with a program record 125 points, 18 points ahead of second place Columbia.
The women were not the only ones to turn in a solid performance however, as the Harvard men’s team competed with limited personnel to claim fifth with 64.5 points, falling short of eventual champion Princeton.
“It was an awesome competition,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I couldn’t be more proud of the way our men and women competed, especially the women…[who had] a target on their back the entire season.”
Fast times, crazy finishes, a rambunctious crowd, broken records, and triumphant farewells made for a competitive rendition of the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships.
The ball started rolling on Saturday, as senior thrower Taylor DuPont opened the Harvard point total with a second place, 16.34 meter mark in the weight throw, while junior Madison Hansen took home third in the women’s pentathlon.
Sophomore Brandon Price chipped in for the men with an 8:12.27 finish in the 3,000 meter finals, good enough for fifth overall.
While most of Saturday was dedicated to preliminaries, that didn’t deny the Crimson a chance to break records.
Senior Danielle Barbian ran a 7.43 in the 60 meter dash preliminaries that broke the meet record that she had held coming into the day. On the men’s side, co-captain Jarvis Harris also had a stellar performance in the 60 meter hurdles, claiming a personal and Harvard all-time best 7.93-second finish.
Both teams would sit in fifth at the end of day one. But things would change quickly going forward.
Sunday started off with an emphatic victory for the Crimson women as sophomore Nikki Okwelogu broke the Ivy League record for the third meet in a row, finishing with a 17.12 meter throw. The Fresno, Calif. native was named Field Athlete of the Meet.
“[The throw] felt so good,” Okwelogu said. “I was just going through it…right when I released it I was [thinking] ‘Yes, yes.’ I was saying it aloud, and I was watching it go because it was unbelievable to watch it soar.”
The field accolades would continue, as sophomore Efe Uwaifo would set a Harvard record in the triple jump, winning the event with a leap of 15.88 meters, while classmate Joshua Whitener would place fourth in the weight throw.
The action was not limited to the field, as the sprint events provided some of the most exciting races of the day.
Barbian continued her success by taking home the title in the 60 meter dash with an Ancient Eight record of 7.40 seconds, with her teammate Collinsworth right behind her at 7.44.
The senior would not stop there however, as Barbian would claim another victory in the 200-meter race, breaking the school record with a final time of 24.03. For her collective performance, Barbian was awarded with the Track Athlete of the Meet award.
“It was a big deal for me,” Barbian said. “[The 200 meter] was one of those races that has always been tough…. This year was a focus that I was going to dig deep and run it.”
The women would also dominate the 60 meter hurdles, as junior Autumne Franklin broke her personal and meet record with a time of 8.41, second-fastest in Crimson history. Sophomore Jackie Modesett and junior Madison Hansen were close behind Franklin, taking third and fifth, respectively.
On the men’s side, Harris would pull off a tight victory in the men’s 60 meter hurdles, finishing with a time of 7.94, one millisecond ahead of Princeton senior Rob Mohr.
“It feels really good, it’s been a long time coming,” Harris said. “After coming back from injury in November, I was fired up and ready to get back on pace.”
The captain would be joined by freshman Malcolm Johnson, who continued his successful rookie campaign by taking home the 60-meter dash title with a time of 6.88 seconds, just a tick ahead of fellow freshman Carrington Akosa of Princeton.
The relays and distance races would prove to be critical as well as the women would clinch their overall victory by taking home the 4 x 880 relay. Junior Paige Kouba teamed up with seniors Molly Renfer, Gabrielle Scott, and Veidis to pull out of reach of Columbia.
The men’s 4 x 880 team finished fifth, as the team of freshman Jonas Aranda and seniors Billy Looney, Nephat Maritim, and Connor Reck clocked in at 7:40.061.
The 800 meter race would prove to be fruitful for Harvard as well. Veidis took home second place with a 2:07.53 finish. On the men’s side, Aranda and Looney would make the podium with fifth and sixth place finishes, respectively.
In the mile races, Renfer and Kouba would take home third and fourth in the women’s mile, respectively, while Reck would place sixth in the men’s race.
Sophomore Sarah Gillespie would place third in the 1000 meter race with junior Kieran Gallagher behind her in fifth place in a race which saw the Crimson pick up eight more points.
The day ended with the 4 x 440 relays, where Hansen, Collinsworth, Franklin, and Modesett combined to take home third place accolades, finishing the race in 3:43.899. The men’s iteration saw Harris lead rookies Andrew Bolze, Matthew Hurst, and Alexander Moore to a fourth place finish. Hurst had also taken runner-up accolades in the 200 meter dash and fourth in the 400 meter run earlier in the day
With the last race wrapped up and the awards ceremony concluded, the Harvard athletes were left to celebrate as the individual winners received congratulations from friends, family, and teammates, while the women ran a victory lap, enjoying another title.
“It was a really special weekend,” Veidis said. “It was a team weekend and that’s what made the three-peat victory so incredible, because everyone worked together…it felt like we did it as a whole.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One could say that without co-captain Erin McDonnell, the Harvard women’s basketball team could be walking away from this past weekend with very different results.
After an up-and-down Ivy season, the Crimson looked to earn its first back-to-back Ivy wins of the year in their final home stand at Lavietes Pavilion, with Cornell and Columbia in its path.
On Friday night, McDonnell played an essential role in Harvard’s breakout second half against the Big Red. Though the senior went scoreless in the first half, the second frame was a much different story.
She broke the ice about three minutes into the second half with a layup to pull the Crimson within two. That’s all it took to get her started. In a crucial 16-4 run that put Harvard back in the driver’s seat, McDonnell scored seven of her 15 points on the night.
On the Crimson’s next offensive possession, it was McDonnell for three. The score was knotted at 30-30. Just over two minutes later, she knocked down another from deep.
With 12 minutes to go, she added another two after snagging an offensive rebound off of a miss from junior guard Kit Metoyer. As Harvard expanded its cushion to eight points, McDonnell contributed five more points in less than a minute, and from there the Crimson cruised to the 60-54 victory.
Saturday night, McDonnell capped off the win in a more dramatic fashion. She scored 15 points in the game, but it was the final three with 58 seconds remaining that made all the difference. After a back and forth game against Columbia, McDonnell found herself at the top of the arc with the game on the line and no defenders in sight. She received the ball from junior guard Shilpa Tummala and sunk a three to seal the win.
“I felt good that this team was going to find a way to win,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “[But] I did get nervous with that last shot.”
Two possessions later, the clock wound to zero and the Crimson had completed its first weekend sweep of the year. The bench erupted, and McDonnell and co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins celebrated their senior night victory over the Lions.
Though the team is out of contention for an Ivy title, being able to get a victory for her team was the most important thing for McDonnell on Saturday night. Along with her 15 points, she also added four rebounds and three assists.
“We played with so much heart because it was our senior night and we love each other so much,” McDonnell said. “We just wanted to show how much we love each other on the floor.”
But to her teammates, McDonnell’s ability to step up in clutch moments is no surprise.
“All of us were so pumped, but that’s just who Erin is,” junior forward AnnMarie Healy said. “If she needs to step up and hit big shots she will…. That’s exactly who we wanted to shoot the ball at the end of the game.”
McDonnell is near the top on the team in nearly every shooting statistical category. Most impressive is her 41.8 percent shooting percentage from behind the arc and averaging 2.3 triples per game. She has scored in double figures in 23 games this season.
Along with being a consistent threat from deep, McDonnell makes up a third of Harvard’s dominant frontcourt trio including Healy and senior forward Temi Fagbenle. With each of these starters towering over six feet tall, height advantages have helped Harvard all season. Just this past weekend, the Crimson outscored Cornell in the paint, 32-12, and Columbia, 36-26.
As one of the team’s best three point shooters and leading scorers, the senior has played a quintessential role on the court all season, but her role as a captain expands far beyond her ability to sink shots from deep.
“Erin is an incredible person along with being an incredible player,” Healy said. “Both on and off the court she is just so fun to be around and always knows whether we’re playing a game or in life…how to pick us up. She’s a great leader both on and off the court.”

Tired from all your psets, midterms, and papers and in desperate need of a carb binge? Well, you're in luck because March 3rd is IHOP National Pancake Day!
IHOP is giving out a free stack of buttermilk pancakes from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. to each visitor, and it's for a great cause too! IHOP will be asking for a $5 donation at the door, all of which will go to the Miracle Balloon campaign, which helps local charities provide the proper care and equipment for sick and injured children.
And for those of you who don't know where the nearest IHOP is (shame on you), it's on Eliot Street across the street from the Kennedy School. So stop writing that paper and text your friends ASAP for some pancake plans tomorrow! You know you want to.

Harvard Square: Where you can find gourmet food, cozy coffee shops, cute clothing stores, and wait…two of the exact same drug store within 100 yards of each other.
In case you hadn’t noticed, there’s a second CVS in the square squeezed on JFK street in between the Yogurtland-Shake Shack plaza and the Curious George store (Side note: Why do we have a Curious George store? In what world would you ever need to shop at a Curious George store?). The “other” CVS is puny, cramped, and a tad pathetic, but it still holds its ground. While most Harvard students probably frequent the gleaming mecca that is the Mass. Ave CVS, its lesser counterpart does yield some merit.
We’ve compiled a list of pros and cons for each of the locations, in case you feel like doing some convenience store exploration in the future.
