NEW YORK — Tonight, the Harvard men's hockey team battles rival No. 15 Cornell at America's most storied venue, Masidon Square Garden. The Crimson (2-3-2, 1-2-2 ECAC) looks to avenge a 2017-2018 series sweep at the hands of the Big Red (5-3-0, 3-1-0) in the 153rd meeting between the two Ancient Eight foes.
While Cornell leads the all-time series against Harvard by a mark of 76-65-11, the teams are even in games at MSG as they have never clashed there. Saturday night's tilt, which counts as an additional non-conference meeting between the squads, marks the fourth time in the past five years that the Crimson has squared off against an ECAC opponent at the Garden.
Follow the action live from New York with The Crimson.
