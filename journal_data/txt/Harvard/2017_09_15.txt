There’s a reason film editing is often called “the invisible art”: The goal of most editors is to create a seamless finished product, with no trace of their tampering. In reality, their fingerprints are all over the final film, and they are often among the most important figures in the entire process. Although the actors and the cinematographers play the primary roles in producing the footage available, it is up to the editor to splice this footage together to create a story.
Film editing is part of post-production, or everything that goes on after the actual shooting of the film stops. Other aspects of post-production include sound editing and mixing, computer generated effects, and soundtrack creation. The film editor’s job is to join together the various shots into scenes, and the scenes into a finished movie. They usually work closely with the director to realize his or her vision for the film and to make the efforts of everyone else involved shine.
Before the advent of digital editing, the film editor would literally cut up the film and piece it back together. An editor would take long strips of film, cut them precisely, and stick them to other strips with tape and glue, creating rolls of film. Nowadays, all this work is done on a computer and is much more accessible to amateurs.
In case you’re still doubting the importance of the film editor, consider the famous Kuleshov Effect. Lev Kuleshov, a Soviet filmmaker, spliced together shots of a man’s face—showing no obvious emotion—with shots of some food, a young girl in a coffin, and a beautiful woman. Audiences believed that the actor expressed a different emotion each time: first hunger, then sadness, then desire. However, each shot of the actor was identical. Instead, it was the context, given to the audience by the editing, that created the illusion of emotion.
It is often difficult to judge the quality of editing in a film. Sometimes editors go for a stylized look, packing many energetic cuts into a short span of time. Often, however, the sure sign of great editing is just how invisible it is. The Oscar-winning editor Walter Murch, known for “Apocalypse Now” and “The Conversation,” once said that “Every film is a puzzle really, from an editorial point of view.” Once the job is done, and done well, it’s hard to even notice the separate pieces.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hello everybody!” chirps Zoe Sugg in her light Wiltshire accent. She’s sitting in front of a Canon DSLR on a tripod, professional lighting equipment illuminating her meticulously-applied red lipstick and neatly styled blonde hair. “Today I’m going to be doing something that I love doing, that you all request quite a fair bit, which I haven’t done in quite a while. That’s a Q&A.”
Sugg, 26, proceeds to answer questions submitted via social media about her experiences and opinions. She’ll edit the footage with Final Cut Pro, then upload the video to an audience of 11 million. This video will attract 2.2 million views.
YouTube stars like Sugg (known as “Zoella” on YouTube) constitute a particular brand of celebrity culture, one that straddles the line between celebrity and citizen. They’re famous, yet accessible. Most of them come from middle-class backgrounds, in touch with quotidian anxieties like buying groceries, taking out the trash, and walking the dog—yet they get recognized in public, routinely feature in magazines like Vogue and Seventeen, and market their own brands of merchandise.
YouTube stars don’t just advertise cosmetics and clothing; they commodify their own personal lives. In “daily vlogs,” they edit documentary-style footage into cutesy montages, manufacturing one picture-perfect day after another. There’s no detail too personal to publish. The Internet is privy to their friendships and romantic relationships, the interiors of their childhood houses, and what they eat for any given meal. It’s symbiotic voyeurism: The stars reap the benefits of heightened exposure, and viewers, the majority aged between 13 and 24, get to vicariously experience what it’s like to be a grown-up with virtually no consequences.
Naturally, that’s exciting and satisfying to watch. Their videos present adulthood through an Instagram filter: Mornings begin with fruit yogurt parfaits, a wardrobe of designer clothes, and a vanity replete with high-end makeup. Average days include strolls on the pier, shopping trips, photo shoots, and drinking hot chocolate out of Mason jars, and finally conclude with sunsets and movie nights with friends. Everyone here is beautiful, white, and thin. No, it’s not a realistic portrayal of adult life: It’s better.
If there’s any merit to justify frittering away the hours on frivolous content, it takes the form of promoting social issues. Sugg has advocated for mental health awareness and treatment. Beauty blogger Tanya Burr, with a following of over 3.6 million, documented her trip to New York City to speak at the United Nations about her Global Goals campaign, focused on publicizing the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals. And in one of her vlogs, Niomi Smart talked at length about the Aleppo humanitarian crisis. They command massive platforms—at least they occasionally use them to enact social change among impressionable audiences.
Arguably, though, it’s easy for YouTubers—twenty- and thirty-somethings—to forget just how impressionable their audiences are. Their version of adulthood is glamorous, yes, but also glamorized. There’s a mentality surrounding YouTube stars, and celebrity culture in general, that these lifestyles are somehow ideal lives worthy of aspiration. “You’re #goals,” viewers comment. It’s important (especially for younger viewers) to recognize that vlogs, despite how they’re presented, aren’t reality. They’re carefully curated, filtered, edited versions of the truth.
That’s not to say that YouTube stars, like all celebrities, are placed under the magnifying glass. With a spotlight that bright, their mistakes are on full display alongside their triumphs—everything from allegedly ghost-written novels to homophobic slurs—sometimes, as a self-incriminating result of their own documentation.
At the conclusion of the Q&A video, Sugg addresses an inquiry submitted via Twitter: Is being a YouTuber sometimes hard?
“Just like with everything else, you’re going to have your down days, and you’re going to have your up days,” she says. “The difference is everyone is going to know about them.”

“Dunkirk”
5.0/5 Stars
Dir. Christopher Nolan (Warner Brothers)
In today’s age of digital content, fewer people are finding reason to go to the movie theater. For many, the question is, “Why would I want to travel to the theater to see a movie now when I can stream it from the comfort of my own home just a few months later?” In many cases, this is a very compelling argument. However, there are some films that just cannot be seen on the small screen, and there is no better example of this than “Dunkirk,” Christopher Nolan’s boldly experimental blockbuster war epic released earlier this summer.
What makes “Dunkirk” so special is that it relies on immersion to tell its story. “Dunkirk” is more an experience than it is a traditional film. The movie doesn’t have a complex plot with twists and turns. In fact, most people already know the story of the film—after all, it is a seminal part of modern history, and there’s no surprise in how the film ends. The movie doesn’t really have any characters either. The name of the protagonist, Tommy, is never even mentioned in the film, and he is given no backstory and basically no development. Nolan specifically chose this name for the character because it is a slang term for the typical British soldier in World War II.
“Dunkirk” hooks audiences, however, by placing them right into the terror of war. The film never tells the audience why they should be scared. Instead, it forces them to witness the terrifying pop of a gunshot or the painful screeching of a German bomber plane. The characters function as vessels through which the audience can experience the war. When you project yourself onto the blank canvases of the characters, you feel as if you are there, and suddenly the film is not about whether or not the army will survive the retreat, but rather about whether you will survive the retreat.
Because “Dunkirk” drops the audience right into World War II instead of telling a story about World War II, it is wholly unique among the hundreds of war films that have come before it. Add that to the fact that the film is nail-bitingly suspenseful, thematically complex, and masterfully crafted, and the product is undoubtedly one of Nolan’s greatest films to date.

“Hampstead”
3.0/5 Stars
Dir. Joel Hopkins (Scope Pictures)
“Hampstead” is the most amiable summer romance that you probably have never heard of. Starring legendary actors Diane Keaton and Brendan Gleeson as a most unlikely couple, this romantic comedy is both exceedingly pleasant and harmless. Keaton plays a slightly eccentric widowed American woman named Emily, who is living in the London suburb of Hampstead and doing her best to ignore her increasingly dire financial situation. Her dreary life changes as she befriends the misanthropic Irishman Donald (Gleeson), a tramp
who has squatted for 17 years on the grounds of a rundown hospital that faces Emily’s apartment building.
Because the characters are so distinctive, it takes much time to convince the audience of the unlikely pairing of Emily and Donald, with much credit due to the actors rather than the script. Keaton’s Emily bears a strong resemblance to her famous Annie Hall, not only in her idiosyncratic behavior but also in her menswear-inspired wardrobe. While it is charming and well done, it can sometimes feel a bit too rehashed. Regardless, she charms both Donald and the audience with her wit and quirkiness. Gleeson is equally funny, imbuing his character with a reticence that in other actors might be heavy-handed, but is here perfectly balanced with vulnerability. Other comedic standouts include Lesley Manville, who plays one of Emily’s nosy neighbors. Her dry pestering and cutting comments do much to jazz up the script when it can feel a little bit too warm.
Though writer Robert Festinger does a wonderful job of keeping the movie light with spicy dialogue between the two leads, the rest of the film can at times feel too mellow and trite. Nevertheless, this film is the kind that you can’t help smiling about after it’s finished, even though you might not remember it a week after viewing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Summer 2017 saw new releases from old favorites, reigning superstars, and talented up-and-comers. Two Crimson Arts editors break down the biggest albums and singles released since you left campus.
Arcade Fire: “Everything Now”
Arcade Fire, with the help of a viral marketing campaign, excited the indie rock world with the announcement of a fifth album, their first since 2013’s “Reflektor.” “Everything Now,” which came out July 28, shows the continuing influence of electronica on the group, who came to prominence via orchestral indie anthems. “Everything Now” has its high points: All three iterations of the title track stand among the group’s finest songs, and “Signs of Life” boasts an undeniably catchy melody. But “Everything Now” lacks both the lyrical insight and musical ingenuity of Arcade Fire’s previous work. At 47 minutes, it feels much longer, in part because its middle section drags, weighed down by bland melodies and more ponderous explorations of the same ideas frontman Win Butler has been singing about for years.
DJ Khaled and Rihanna: “Wild Thoughts” (single)
DJ Khaled and Rihanna are no strangers to massive chart hits. With song-of-the-summer candidate “Wild Thoughts,” they have ... another one. Khaled et al.’s production heavily samples Santana’s “Maria Maria”—Billboard calls it “practically a cover with different lyrics.” But Rihanna, a Harvard favorite since long before her visit to Sanders Theater sent campus into a frenzy, gives the song a sultry, refreshing update. Her trademark sound overshadows Bryson Tiller’s less memorable verse, though his smooth delivery adds an R&B inflection to the Latin-pop sound. The song has also inspired some excellent remixes.
Lana Del Rey: “Lust for Life”
As Lana Del Rey discovered in 2013 with “Summertime Sadness,” putting the word “summer” in the title can help us suggestible listeners choose it as our soundtrack of the season. Sure enough, her fifth album, “Lust for Life,” reached the top spot on the Billboard 200, partly on the strength of its single “Summer Bummer.” “Lust for Life” doesn’t represent much evolution for Del Rey: Its sweeping, baroque-hip-hop production and sex-and-summer subject matter sound much like the rest of her output. But the formula works—and these whopping 72 minutes of gorgeously sung and richly arranged melodies might make for the most fully realized Lana album. The high-profile features, including The Weeknd, A$AP Rocky, Stevie Nicks, and Sean Lennon, embody her signature synthesis of retro and contemporary, lending the album some needed variety.
Lorde: “Melodrama”
Somehow, Lorde, who became a world-famous multi-millionaire at 16, has become one of the most widely relatable songwriters of her (our) generation. Her lyrics are just that evocative, that immediate. After a fan-torturing three and a half years since her debut, Lorde returned with a much-anticipated sophomore album. Nearly every song could have been a hit single: Catchy melodies, super-accessible production, and captivating lyrical turns of phrase abound, from the opening anthem “Green Light” to the reflective but upbeat “Supercut” to the closing pop gem “Perfect Places.”
Taylor Swift: “Reputation” (single) 
Taylor Swift shocked the world with the surprise announcement of her album “Reputation” (out November 10) after a carefully staged social media blackout. Its lead single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” has been as divisive as Swift herself has been in recent months, following her very public off-again, on-again feud with Kanye West. While the darker, hip-hop-influenced single has caused many fans to lament—and haters to celebrate—that “the old Taylor can’t come to the phone / ’Cause she’s dead”, it’s clear that Swift is, once again, taking advantage of the free press generated by any and all controversy. And to spectacular effect—the music video, a sequel in the spirit of “Blank Space,” broke Adele’s record for YouTube views within 24 hours (43 million).
Tyler, The Creator: “Flower Boy”
Tyler, The Creator’s fourth solo album, “Flower Boy,” shows huge progress from his previous effort, 2015’s “Cherry Bomb”, which was equally admired and panned for its youthful ambition and experimentation. From Tyler’s confidently introspective lyricism, to his more sensitive yet energetic production, to the album’s cohesive sound throughout its short 46 minutes, “Flower Boy” is Tyler at his most comfortable: He’s finally found a balance between his aggressive (“Who Dat Boy”) and angsty (“911 / Mr. Lonely”) sides. Despite his extensive past usage of homophobic slurs in his lyrics, Tyler includes more homoerotic lines in “Flower Boy,” rapping: “I’ve been kissing white boys since 2004.”
JAY-Z: “4:44”
Taylor Swift wasn’t the only artist to be reincarnated this summer: JAY-Z ended his four-year creative dry spell with “4:44,” a lyrical and musical blast from the plast. On “4:44”’s opening track, “Kill Jay Z”, Jay Z evolves into JAY-Z, rapping: “Cry Jay Z, we know the pain is real / But you can't heal what you never reveal”. JAY-Z certainly takes this advice throughout the album, addressing problems on scales ranging from the personal, such as his long-hypothesized infidelity to Beyoncé or his beef with Kanye West, to the societal, when he prescribes strategies for preserving black excellence on “The Story of O.J.” or “Legacy.” And it’s clear that JAY-Z is thinking about his own legacy: He raps with a fluidity evocative of his once-upon-a-time lyrical talent, and his co-executive production with No I.D. utilizes samples like an album from 2007, not 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following my humid stint at Fort Knox, I had the privilege to shadow a first lieutenant stationed with the 25th Infantry Division in Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. Although our weekdays were spent laboring at our company’s motor pool, the weekends were ours to explore. As such, on our last Sunday on Oahu, the other cadets and I decided to visit the memorial at Pearl Harbor.
The entrance to the park was largely packed with tourists. Children were playing with tablets, mothers tried their best to organize family photos, and various tourists were fiddling with their translator headsets. Our ticket to see the USS Arizona was for 13:30, and having arrived there around noon, we naturally stopped by the park gift shop.
The gift shop was stocked with your standard set of trinkets, t-shirts, maps, and coffee table souvenirs. However, a unique item immediately grabbed my attention: a hand painted mahogany model of a Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter plane. The Zero was the unchallenged master of the early Pacific Theater, a feat of Japanese engineering. The model was gorgeous, but it seemed slightly out of place. After all, 76 years ago, it was the Zero that wrought havoc on the U.S. Pacific Fleet stationed at Pearl Harbor.
Seventy-six years ago, the sight of the Zero sparked terror across the Pacific; from China to Guadalcanal, the Zero symbolized the cruelty and destructive power of the Japanese Empire. Today, all that remains of Japan’s imperial air fleets are playthings, wooden toys sold to American collectors at a gift shop built on a former Japanese target. The situation struck me as odd; I felt as though I was visiting the set of a Star Wars shoot, not the site of a national tragedy. I don’t oppose National Parks selling souvenirs. After all, these parks need to pay their staff. However, the model plane drew my attention to a larger problem I have with American war memorials: the American perception of war.
For most of America’s post-Civil War history, the American civilian has rarely (if ever) witnessed war firsthand. Consequently, war is generally viewed as a foreign affair. Our servicemen go abroad to fight and die, while the general populace remains at home, free to tune in at their leisure and watch the bloody spectacle unfold on television. Eventually, wars end, monuments are built, and the nation moves on. A movie is made, and heroes are immortalized.
But that’s not what war is. War is not beautiful. War is the screams of helpless men. War is the sobbing of orphaned children. War is the silence of a city wiped from existence. War is the empty chairs meant for the fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters who will never return.
At 13:30 we stepped on the escort boat that would take us the USS Arizona memorial. The memorial itself is pristine, clean, and—like the mahogany model of the Japanese Zero—disturbingly beautiful. From atop the monument you can look down at the remains of the USS Arizona, the final resting place of over two-thirds of her crew. Oil slowly makes its way to the surface, as if the ship continues to bleed. If you look down, you can imagine the sound of twisted steel crushing unsuspecting sailors, and for a moment, you can almost see the desperation felt by the 1,177 souls who sank with her.
This is not an anti-war piece; I am an avid interventionist and strongly believe that the maintenance of the American empire is better for most people when compared to potential post-American alternatives. Moreover, every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine I’ve met is willing to give their life at a moment’s notice if our nation deems their sacrifice necessary. However, I’m concerned with how casually America wages war. We half-assed our post-war plans for Iraq and Afghanistan, have no long-term plan for Syria, and are currently engaged in a complicated geopolitical act in East Asia. For most Americans, war means the death of strangers, thereby devaluing its otherwise horrendous consequences and converting war into nothing more than a modern televised battle scene from Game of Thrones.
If you ever visit a memorial or battleground, I ask that you imagine your loved ones dying. I want you to picture them, alone, bleeding to death in some foreign land. No glory. No eulogy. No wreaths or neatly wrapped American flags. Just death. And if you’re unwilling to let your loved ones pay that price, then who are you to so eagerly ask others to do so on your jingoistic behalf?

Harvard’s decision to provide Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students with membership in the caregiver-finding service Care.com and subsidize 10 days of childcare per student through the site is, on one level, admirable. Graduate students, through the Graduate Student Council and Harvard GSAS Student-Parents Association, have been tirelessly advocating for their education and their families, both of which will be better off for them having doing so.
For its part, GSAS responded correctly by offering these students and their peers free membership to Care.com and financially aiding students in actually purchasing the site’s services. In this respect, these parties each acted commendably to produce a solution with tangible benefits for both students and GSAS by the end of the fall. Students will be less strained in finding and paying for childcare, and GSAS will now have a portion of its student body more able to focus on successful teaching and research.
This development should also be viewed as a success of graduate students’ campaign to unionize, which includes childcare under its “Working for a Healthy Harvard” banner. Despite the inauspicious future of unionization, Harvard’s willingness to subsidize childcare so soon after the campaign shows students’ prowess in negotiating with the administration for more benefits.
Nevertheless, this agreement is far from a comprehensive solution to the problems facing graduate students who are balancing academic and parental commitments. Ten subsidized days per year—while undeniably helpful in the event of emergency—is no panacea for the need for year-round support that graduate student parents and their children require. This situation is particularly pernicious when viewed in the light of the issues female academics face because of their gender. Those issues include balancing academic commitments with pregnancy and childrearing, the financial problems incurred by this balance, the potentially reduced availability of contraceptives due to the Trump administration’s policies, and statistically lower tenure rates than men. While the new proposal is an important step toward ensuring female academics are as set up for success as men, it is clear much more must be done to reach this goal.
These aims are in the interests of the University as well: Better resources for female academics will bolster Harvard’s reputation as well as attract and retain female scholars at all levels of their careers. These efforts can help make Harvard a more equitable institution that empowers the academic leaders the University aspires so strongly to create. Hence, Harvard must ensure that all of its graduate students have access to affordable, comprehensive childcare. While this recent agreement will not fully solve this problem, it’s a baby step in the right direction.

In discussing adversity, the white, working poor of rural America are often absent from consideration.
I will never forget the moment last semester when that became abundantly clear to me. While attending a faculty panel hosted by the Graduate School of Education, I heard a question posed asking what the professors thought could be done for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups that do not value education. One professor responded by saying that that was not the case—that marginalized groups in America did, in fact, see the merits of a proper education for their children. He then began listing various demographics that fit under the umbrella of “disadvantaged,” including inner city minorities, new immigrants, first generation Americans, and blacks in the rural South.
But he failed to mention the working poor in rural, white America. Now, when I consider who is discriminated against in America, white people, as whole, do not come to mind. But to hear a professor at the most powerful, free-thinking institution in the world discuss educational disparities and disregard poor whites led to a startling revelation.
I know, with firsthand experience, that the people of my community struggle to appreciate, or even recognize, the values of education. That is why it’s common for half the kids from my school who enroll in college to drop out after their first semester. My father is one of 13 children raised on a dairy farm, and because of that, on his side of the family alone, I have about 60 aunts, uncles, and first cousins. Though almost all of them are older than me, I will only be the third of us to attain a bachelor’s degree.
My family is a working family. We respect people who have grit, not degrees. The highest compliment you can receive from one of my relatives is that you’re “one hell of a worker,” which is usually a reference to your proficiency with, and high tolerance for, manual labor. Of course we know that education is “good,” but the people of my town don’t go out of their way—and, in fact, do not even know how—to make sure they receive a great one. It’s a different world back in my home of Madison, N.Y., and it’s not the world that was suggested by that faculty panel.
That day at GSE, I witnessed the great divide that now plagues our nation, a divide between the political right and left. In that moment, I saw a Harvard professor, a member of the liberal elite, overlook the issues facing the people of my conservative, poor, and white community. There are plenty of logical reasons for why that professor considered the groups previously mentioned as facing larger obstacles in the realm of education, but relativity does not make my people’s problems any less real. The lack of mutual awareness between America’s conservatives and liberals is perhaps our greatest challenge today.
It is the burden of us rural whites at Harvard to exist on either side of that divide. We walk a thin line connecting our conservative hometowns with our more progressive college campus. A significant amount of my time freshman year was spent trying to reconcile these two parts of my life.
At home, I am an over-idealistic liberal, out-of-touch with reality. Here, I am a staunch conservative who has a lot to learn about life. In some regards, both depictions are accurate; I consider that the hallmark of true political mediation. But in that moment at GSE, I found myself not just situated in the middle of the divide but also falling down the crack.
By now, many Americans are exhausted of the never-ending sociological analyses and political commentary on Trump’s core demographic of voters, which includes my family and hometown. And yet, I still find myself explaining why my relatives found a Trump presidency preferable, even though all rationality suggests that a Trump presidency is not in the best interest of common Americans struggling to make ends meet.
When I think of Trump supporters, I think not of the screaming, white woman in a rally crowd or of the human garbage that marches through the streets carrying a torch and declaring white supremacy. Instead, I think of my father, the same man who has always defended welfare because some people just “don’t have any money,” who was quick to accept me after I made the decision to sleep with other men, and who once described how much he teared up while listening to a Bosnian coworker narrate his escape from a war-torn country.
He voted for Donald Trump, not because he is hateful, but because he is frustrated with the state of our nation. He is tired of a government that continues to make empty promises, is aggravated by a popular culture that paints his family as stupid hicks, and is pained to see menial jobs outsourced when that type of work has been what sustained him and all of his siblings—my aunts and uncles—when they did not have the money to finance their own educational pursuits for in-demand technical skills.
When I was home this past summer, I found myself having a lot of conversations about things that people in my small, racially homogenous town would never otherwise consider. Simple things like what it means to be transgender, how racism isn’t always intentional, and why the election of Trump is, justifiably, terrifying for so many people. These are conversations that need to be had and that need to go both ways. It’s just one more step in working to bridge that great divide.

Director of the CIA Mike Pompeo did not attend his scheduled appearance at an Harvard Institute of Politics forum event Thursday in protest of Chelsea Manning’s appointment as a visiting fellow at the IOP.
Attendees showed up at the event only to hear Dean of Harvard Kennedy School Doug Elmendorf announce that Pompeo would not be speaking. Later in the evening, the CIA released a letter from Pompeo confirming he pulled out of the event because of Manning’s appointment.
“Ms. Manning betrayed her country and was found guilty of 17 serious crimes for leaking classified information to Wikileaks,” Pompeo wrote in his letter to Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, director of Intelligence and Defense Projects at Harvard Kennedy School. “Indeed, Ms. Manning stands against everything the brave men and women I serve alongside stand for.”
Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier and transgender rights advocate, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking over 700,000 military documents to WikiLeaks—the largest leak of classified records in American history. In January, former President Barack Obama commuted her sentence, and she was released from prison four months later.
“Harvard’s actions implicitly tell Harvard students that you too can be a fellow at Harvard and a felon under United States law,” Pompeo wrote. “I believe it is shameful for Harvard to place its stamp of approval on her treasonous actions.”
Spokespeople for the Kennedy School did not respond to requests for comment Thursday night.
Pompeo’s cancelled appearance came hours after Michael Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA, resigned from his Senior Fellowship at the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School.
In his resignation letter, Morell cited deep opposition to Manning’s actions, and wrote that “the Kennedy School’s decision will assist Ms. Manning in her long-standing effort to legitimize the criminal path that she took to prominence.”
“Unfortunately, I cannot be part of an organization - The Kennedy School - that honors a convicted felon and leaker of classified information, Ms. Chelsea Manning, by inviting her to be a Visiting Fellow at the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics,” Morell wrote.
On Twitter, Manning fired back, retweeting Morell’s resignation letter and writing one word—“good”—followed by several emojis.
Elmendorf announced Pompeo’s cancellation to the crowd at the event Thursday night. 
“I’m very sorry to have to announce that the CIA Director will not be speaking here tonight. He has had other—well, I think he will have to speak more specifically later to why he is not here, but he is not here, he will not speak, we’re very sorry about that,” Elmendorf said.
Pompeo and Morell’s actions were part of a broader conservative backlash, both on campus and around the country, to Manning’s appointment.
Kent K. Haeffner ’18, President of the Harvard Republicans Club, called Manning a “traitor,” and said her hiring was “a shame.”
“It is a shame that the IOP has decided to give a platform to someone who is so diametrically opposed to the values of patriotism and public service that are embedded in its mission,” Haeffner wrote in a statement.
Others on campus defended Manning. Noah R. Wagner ’18, a member of the Harvard Trans Task Force, speaking in a personal capacity, praised the IOP for appointing Manning.
“Whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning are exactly the people that we need, shedding light on the atrocities and injustices for which the U.S. military is responsible, and for which there is rarely transparency or accountability. She’s also a personal hero of mine and a hero for many members of the trans community,” Wagner said.
Several conservative politicians took to Twitter Thursday to applaud Morell and lambast Harvard.
“Well done, Mike. And abject shame on Harvard,” former presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney tweeted.
Members of Congress also weighed in. Senator Ben Sasse called Morell’s letter “a good reminder that National Security matters and integrity matters,” while Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming said Harvard’s federal funding should be cut for hiring Manning.
Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, used Morell’s resignation to congratulate Manning. “Great work @xychelsea! Mike Morell is serial fabulist and a torture proponent. Hazard to Harvard. Blight on students,” Assange wrote on Twitter.

In addition to offering students new options like poutine and street tacos, Harvard University Dining Services has also increased its selection of locally-sourced foods this semester.
Starting in the spring, HUDS partnered with CommonWealth Kitchen—a Boston-based company that invests in sustainable and local food startups—to bring foods made from local produce to dining halls. Starting this fall, 88 Acres, a startup affiliated with Commonwealth Kitchen, provides a variety of seed butters to dining halls each day.
HUDS also purchased locally-processed salsas from Nola’s Fresh Foods, another company that works with CommonWealth Kitchen. HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin said Harvard hopes to continue working with CommonWealth Kitchen and its affiliated companies to bring new sauces, like chimichurri and green curry, to dining halls.
Martin added that although Harvard dining halls have previously worked to buy locally, this year’s changes mark an increased effort to support farms and companies located within a 250-mile radius of Cambridge. She said HUDS changes its menus throughout the year based on foods in season—offerings in the fall and spring are particularly rife feature especially high amounts of local produce.
Red’s Best seafood, a longstanding HUDS staple purchased exclusively from Boston fishermen, is one such local product
On a given day, anywhere from 20 to 70 percent of produce found in dining halls is grown locally. Other products are also largely sourced locally—HUDS uses milk from Massachusetts cows, yogurt from Vermont, and meats processed throughout New England.
HUDS also recently transitioned from Seattle’s Best coffee to the Massachusetts-based roasters Pierce Brothers, according to Martin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sporting formal wear and spouting small talk, College sophomores this week kicked off a punch season unlike any other in the tradition’s long history.
Traditionally invite-only and single-gender, this year’s punch process—a final club-specific term for the weeks-long process by which students are chosen for membership in one of Harvard’s twelve final clubs—features eight “open” punches and two gender neutral ones.
This punch season is also the last before a controversial College policy penalizes sophomores for joining single-gender groups. Though the policy could still be altered by a committee tasked with reviewing it, some clubs have nevertheless made significant changes to longstanding punch traditions.
The gender-neutral Sab Club and the all-male A.D. Club have been the most public about the new format of their punches.
Like last fall, the A.D. sent mass invitations to their first punch event—this year, at the Cambridge Skating Club on Sept. 12—via email. Because the College does not recognize final clubs, the A.D. cannot publicize its open punch through methods employed by recognized student organizations, such as emailing over House lists or postering on College bulletin boards.
The Sab similarly emailed many sophomores of all genders to punch the club at events space “Warehouse XI” Thursday evening in Somerville for the group’s gender-inclusive punch event.
“As a club that has stood behind efforts to increase equity and transparency within the college’s social landscape, it was incredibly important to us that we still conducted an open punch this year, not just to keep our word, but to give every sophomore a chance to put his or her best foot forward,” Lulu S. Chua-Rubenfeld ’18, the president of the Sab, wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
The Owl Club will host its second open punch this year for interested sophomore men as well. In September 2016, then-undergraduate president Kevin D. Rex ’17 first announced the Owl’s intention to hold a punch process “open to all sophomore males.”
Though less publicly, Harvard’s female final clubs are extending their invitations to prospective members besides those that members of the clubs personally select—a practice in line with that of previous years.
“We want to include all Sophomore girls!” the Bee Club, which is now sharing membership with the Delphic, wrote in this year’s invitation to its first punch event. “R.S.V.P. with your name and the name of each friend you’re bringing.”
Invites from the La Vie, the IC, and the Pleiades Society also encouraged recipients of their punch cards to bring friends.
The all-male Porcellian Club, in comparison, is taking a much less public approach to its “open” punch again. Though the club committed to an open punch in April 2016, that fall the club distributed invitations to only a select group of sophomore men

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College’s Office of Student Life placed more than 50 recognized student organizations—over ten percent of all registered groups—on probation Thursday after the clubs’ leaders failed to attend the annual student leader training, a requirement for all undergraduate groups.
Placing a student organization on probation is a serious penalty, as it removes a group’s eligibility to apply for a roughly $300,000 pot of grant funding from the Undergraduate Council and prevents club members  from reserving on-campus spaces for events and meetings.  Clubs on probation will be ineligible for these privileges at least until a make-up training session on Oct. 4.
Alexander R. Miller, the OSL’s associate dean of student engagement, wrote in an emailed statement that over 50 student organizations failed to attend the annual student leader training where new resources for student organizations were presented.
"The Office of Student Involvement communicated two training opportunities to student organizations as early as Spring term,” Miller wrote in an emailed statement. “We also communicated our expectation that every recognized student organization must send one representative from their group.”
Leaders of affected groups received an email Thursday notifying them of their probation.
“Your group has been placed on probation, which means that you do not have access to the benefits of Recognized Student Organizations,” the email reads.  It proceeded to list consequences of this probationary status, including the inability to host events on campus, use the Harvard name, or recruit on campus.
The OSL has cancelled all space reservations for clubs placed on probation through the beginning of October.
Clubs on probation include the Black Students’ Association, the Association of Black Harvard Women, Harvard Hong Kong Society, and a capella group the Harvard Opportunes.
Prior to the notification that some clubs would be placed on probation, the College had 442 recognized independent student organizations.
Leaders of several student organizations affected by the probation did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
Some groups that received the probation email said that they believe the notification was an error.
Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club president Emily E. Bergquist ’18 said the sudden notification from the OSL caught her organization “off guard,” and she is actively working to resolve the issue.
“We've had problems applying to grants, using RoomBook, and using the Hub, so finding a solution is an extremely urgent priority,” Bergquist wrote in an email.
Though the OSL put over 50 clubs on probation, it is unclear how many of the organizations have active members. Any organization that did not send a representative to the training had their recognition revoked, regardless of whether it was known to have active members or not.

UPDATED: September 18, 2017 at 3:40 p.m.
Local 26, a union that represents hundreds of Harvard University Dining Services workers, and the Harvard College Democrats each endorsed candidates this week ahead of November’s Cambridge City Council election.
The College Democrats voted to endorse just one candidate: incumbent Jan Devereux. Local 26 chose to endorse six candidates, including three incumbents—Mayor E. Denise Simmons,  Craig Kelley, Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern, and Devereux—two new contenders: Paul Toner, and Alanna Mallon.
The endorsements come after SEIU, which represents some of Harvard’s custodial workers, announced its endorsements of Simmons, McGovern, Toner, and newcomer Vatsady Sivongxay.
This year, 26 candidates are running for the nine spots on the City Council. The election will feature an unusually high number of open seats, as three current councillors—Nadeem A. Mazen, Leland Cheung, and David P. Maher—announced earlier this year that they were stepping down.
According to Devontae A. Freeland ’19, campaigns director of the College Democrats, the club has not historically endorsed in races like this—the last candidate the club endorsed was Ed Markey in the 2013 U.S. Senate Election.
The College Democrats’ constitution rules require at least a two-thirds support of all votes to endorse any candidate, and the group can only endorse up to three candidates. Freeland said that sixty votes were cast on Wednesday night, and Devereux is “someone that resonated across the membership of the Dems.”
“[Two-thirds] is not just a small group of people that feel they support this person, it has to be overwhelming support,” Freeland said, “and I think that’s also a factor that led to our endorsing of Jan Devereux.”
While the Democrats held a vote of its members to determine endorsements, Local 26 asked its members for their input.
"The Local 26 Political Endorsement Committee, which is made up of rank-and-file members of our union, reviewed the incumbent candidates records and also interviewed other candidates running for office for the first time,” Local 26 president Brian Lang wrote in an emailed statement. “They concluded these six candidates will be the most effective at creating good jobs and promoting affordable housing.”
With approximately 40 to 50 members on the campaign committee, the College Democrats will work on Devereux’s campaign, postering, making calls, and knocking on doors. Freeland emphasized that another key component in campaign work is to reach out to Harvard students.
To engage students in the local election, Freeland said the College Democrats plan to have a “get-out-the-vote HQ” on November 7, election day. He said that the importance of local politics was especially important given  “the lack of protection of civil rights that we’re seeing at the federal level.”
Elections for Cambridge City Council will be on November 7.

Former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan ’87 has been appointed as an adviser to University President Drew G. Faust for the Allston campus, the University announced Tuesday.
Donovan, who will officially serve as the Senior Strategist and Advisor to the President on Allston and Campus Development, takes on the new role as construction on Harvard’s $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex in Allston continues.
“Shaun Donovan brings deep experience and knowledge to this role,” Faust told the University-owned Harvard Gazette. “We are excited and privileged to have him join us in thinking about important new ways to advance our campus planning efforts and our progress in Allston.”
Donovan will work closely with Harvard’s Executive Vice President Katie Lapp and advise on Allston developments on a part-time basis, with a focus on “education, research, innovation, and entrepreneurship while fostering collaboration across Harvard and within the community.”
After years of delays and complications, Harvard began above-ground construction on the science facility this summer, one of many major construction projects underway across the River from Cambridge. Fundraising progress for Harvard’s Allston campus has lagged compared to other capital campaign priorities, and the University has not announced a primary donor for the Science Complex.
After his undergraduate years at the College, Donovan returned to campus to complete his Master in Public Administration at the Kennedy School as well as a Master of Architecture at the Graduate School of Design.
Following his tenure as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration, Donovan served as Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget until 2017. Donovan also led the President’s Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force.
“I‘m grateful to have this chance to help shape the future of a University and a place that have profoundly shaped me as a person and a professional,” Donovan wrote in a statement. “Allston represents a unique opportunity to build a more collaborative and innovative Harvard, and to further deepen the important partnership between the community and the university.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 15, 2017 at 4:04 a.m. 
Facing backlash from high-ranking current and former CIA officials, the Dean of the Kennedy School of Government withdrew an invitation for Chelsea Manning to serve as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics in a late-night reversal Friday.
“I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in a statement posted to the school’s website shortly after midnight.
The school withdrew the invitation to Manning—a transgender activist and former U.S. Army soldier who was imprisoned after disclosing over 700,000 classified government documents— after CIA Director Mike Pompeo cancelled his scheduled appearance at the school Thursday.
“Ms. Manning betrayed her country and was found guilty of 17 serious crimes for leaking classified information to Wikileaks,” Pompeo wrote in a letter to Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, director of Intelligence and Defense Projects at Harvard Kennedy School on Thursday. “Indeed, Ms. Manning stands against everything the brave men and women I serve alongside stand for.”
Pompeo’s cancelled appearance came hours after Michael Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA, resigned from his Senior Fellowship at the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School. In his resignation letter, Morell cited deep opposition to Manning’s actions, and wrote that “the Kennedy School’s decision will assist Ms. Manning in her long-standing effort to legitimize the criminal path that she took to prominence.”
After the twin denouncements, Elmendorf withdrew the invitation that had been issued on Wednesday.
“We did not intend to honor her in any way or to endorse any of her words or deeds, as we do not honor or endorse any Fellow,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote.
After 3 a.m. Friday, Manning tweeted that she was "honored to be 1st disinvited trans woman visiting @harvard fellow."
"They chill marginalized voices under @cia pressure," she added.

Elmendorf added that Manning is still invited to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, where “the audience [will] have ample opportunity—as with all our speakers—to ask hard questions and challenge what she has said and done.”
“I think we should weigh, for each potential visitor, what members of the Kennedy School community could learn from that person’s visit against the extent to which that person’s conduct fulfills the values of public service to which we aspire,” Elmendorf wrote. “In retrospect, though, I think my assessment of that balance for Chelsea Manning was wrong.”
Pompeo and Morell’s actions were part of a broader backlash, both on campus and around the country, to Manning’s appointment.
Kent K. Haeffner ’18, President of the Harvard Republicans Club, called Manning a “traitor,” and said her hiring was “a shame.”
“It is a shame that the IOP has decided to give a platform to someone who is so diametrically opposed to the values of patriotism and public service that are embedded in its mission,” Haeffner wrote in a statement.
Others on campus defended Manning. Noah R. Wagner ’18, a member of the Harvard Trans Task Force, speaking in a personal capacity, praised the IOP for appointing Manning.
“Whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning are exactly the people that we need, shedding light on the atrocities and injustices for which the U.S. military is responsible, and for which there is rarely transparency or accountability. She’s also a personal hero of mine and a hero for many members of the trans community,” Wagner said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The federal government could still find Harvard College in violation of anti-sex discrimination law Title IX more than three years after the Office for Civil Rights first launched the probe in April 2014, according to several Title IX experts.
Since two then-undergraduates—including a member of the activist organization Our Harvard Can Do Better—filed the Title IX complaint, Harvard has overhauled its approach to sexual assault on campus, adopting a new policy and investigative process.
But federal investigators could conclude that the College is in violation of Title IX based on the policies and procedures in place when the investigation began, experts say. Some aspects of Harvard’s 2014 policies cited in the original complaint, recently obtained by The Crimson through a Freedom of Information of Act Request, were not consistent with federal guidelines.
The 38-page complaint charges that Harvard’s approach to handling sexual assault cases at the time violated Title IX. Complainants allege what they considered insufficient accommodations for students who have been sexually assaulted, inconsistent communication of University policies and resources, and misleading reporting of sexual assault statistics. They took issue with the definition of rape in the policy at the time, as well as the standard that required University investigators to be “sufficiently persuaded” an assault occurred in order to pursue disciplinary action—rather than the “preponderance of the evidence” standard set out in OCR’s 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter.
And an entire section of the complaint is devoted to final clubs, which the complainants describe as “predatory social spaces.”
The document also included testimonials from 10 students who had been sexually assaulted that were redacted in the copy the federal government provided to The Crimson.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in a statement this week that the University never received a copy of the complaint. Per OCR policy, though, institutions receive a letter when OCR begins investigating them. Through the investigatory process, schools are generally able to infer the content of a complaint, according to Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel for the Massachusetts chapter of the Victim Rights Law Center.
“The school will know every single allegation that is charged against them,” she said.
The University was already in the midst of drafting a new Title IX policy when the complaint was filed, and it completed that process in 2014. The new policy defines sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” which means one party “did not request or invite it” and “regarded the unrequested or uninvited conduct as undesirable or offensive.” The accompanying procedures for investigating cases of such harassment now use the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, the lower standard of proof favored by OCR and the 2014 complainants.
Over the ensuing years, former University Title IX officer Mia Karvonides created and grew the central Title IX office—which administrators restructured last spring—and took steps to publicize Title IX resources across campus. And Harvard has begun implementing the recommendations of a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention, albeit unevenly.
Any changes in practices or resources, though, will likely go unremarked in the OCR findings, National Women’s Law Center Senior Counsel for Education Adaku Onyeka-Crawford said.
“The investigation centers in on the point in time at which the complaint was filed,” she said. “OCR is looking at what procedures were in place at that time, and then if the investigation takes longer and policies change, that doesn’t change the fact that there may have been a violation in 2014.”
If OCR determines that a school is not in line with the law, investigators propose that the institution negotiate a voluntary agreement to bring its policies into compliance with Title IX. Harvard Law School, which OCR found to be noncompliant with Title IX in 2014, opted to enter into such a resolution agreement.
But if a school declines to take part in this process, they risk losing federal funding—although the federal government has never withheld funds for this reason to date, according to Bruno and Onyeka-Crawford.
“The resolution agreement doesn’t have teeth,” Bruno said. “It’s an enforcement mechanism, but it’s a letter—and it’s a letter that comes out four plus years later, when 50 percent or more of the things have been changed.”
OCR investigators came to campus in the fall of 2014 to conduct a series of interviews. In an emailed statement Thursday, members of Our Harvard Can Do Better declined to disclose whether they have communicated with investigators since then.
Department of Education spokesperson Jim Bradshaw declined to comment on the progress of the investigation, which he said is ongoing. “As a policy, OCR does not discuss the details of its current investigations,” he wrote in an email this week.
Bruno said OCR investigations often drag on for years—one looking into a complaint she worked on against Tufts University lasted four.
“They drag on so long that it no longer benefits an individual complainant to file—unless the complainant is interested in the grand scheme of the policy,” Bruno said. “If the complainant is interested in individual remedies, then filing a Title IX complaint with OCR is futile.”
The two students who filed the complaint—and as well as the 10 students who provided testimony—have likely since left Harvard. And some of the charges in the complaint have essentially become moot as the University has reformed its practices.
But Our Harvard Can Do Better members Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19,  Sarah M. Ryan ’20, and Julia M. Huesa ’20 pointed to several grievances in the complaint that Harvard has yet to address—specifically, the need for additional accommodations for students who have been sexually assaulted, the lack of “affirmative consent” standard, and adhering to the 60-day timeline for investigations.
A committee chaired by Biology professor and former Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister has been reviewing the current policy since Jan. 2016. Last spring, Pfister said the group had discussed the “affirmative consent” standard.
Harvard spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga declined to comment on the substance of the 2014 complaint, referring The Crimson to the University’s Title IX FAQs and resource guide.
As the federal probe continues, though, federal Title IX guidelines could change under Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who announced last week that she intends to review existing policies. Onyeka-Crawford said that current OCR investigations should, theoretically, continue as usual.
Goldberg, Ryan, and Huesa said that a decision by DeVos to scrap the 2011 Dear Colleague letter should not lessen the University’s duty to mitigate sexual assault.
“Even if Betsy DeVos rejects these guidelines, Title IX remains federal law, and it is our understanding that Harvard has an obligation under this law to improve its policies and practices regarding sexual and gender-based violence,” they wrote in a statement.
Pfister said his committee is watching federal developments “closely.”

UPDATED: September 16, 2017 at 2:49 p.m.
Furnishing Hope—a nonprofit that provides furniture to help with the transition out of homelessness—is due to open in Harvard Square next month, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony set for noon on October 28.
Currently located in Central Square, Furnishing Hope’s more spacious Harvard Square setting on Mt. Auburn Street will serve as a spot for Square residents to donate used or unwanted furniture.
Furnishing Hope Executive Director Suzy Palitz said she hopes the move can help her organization “become more a part of the community and create new relationships with other agencies in Cambridge.”
Denise Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Business Square Administration, believes that the nonprofit will come to fulfil an important role in the Square.
“The fact that we will have one place now that we can donate the furniture and the linens and the kitchen equipment and utensils and plates and dinnerware is really wonderful,” Jillson said. “There is a great need for this.”
Palitz said she started Founding Hope in 2012 after realizing that many families who escaped homelessness still did not have the funds to buy furniture for their new homes.
“I found out that there were groups of families that had fallen through the cracks that ended up housed with nothing,” Palitz said. “I found out that six months, 12 months later many people were still sleeping on the floor.”
Palitz said Furnishing Hope aimed to address this problem by helping families create a “secure home and base for development.”
Now, the nonprofit collaborates with a variety of other organizations in the Cambridge area including Didriks, Gentle Giant, and Cradles to Crayons to connect with and deliver furniture to financially-strained, newly-settled individuals.
Eleanor S. Austin, a Furnishing Hope employee and Extension school student, said the organization often individually tailors donations to the preferences of the children in the families they work with.
“When the referrals come in, thinking of what people would like and what their kids might like, and putting things together is really fun for me,” she said.
Austin said she is also passionate about Furnishing Hope beyond her work responsibilities.
“I have a special understanding of what [Palitz] does because there was a brief time in my life where I was living in my car and did not feel like I had a safe place to go” she said. “I feel really strongly about what she is doing.”

It appeared that the Harvard women’s volleyball team’s match against Boston College would be a fast three-set shutout. But the Eagles (3-6) clawed their way back into the game, and it took a fifth-set tiebreaker for the Crimson (3-4) to finally shut the door on victory.
“We totally dominated the first two sets, but we let up our energy and let them back in and had to slowly get our momentum back near the end of the next few sets,” freshman hitter Mindie Mabry said. “It was a little too late in those sets, but we kept our energy and were able to finish with the win.”
Harvard started off the first set with positive momentum, scoring six straight points in the middle of the set to take a 16-10 lead.
The offensive weapons for the Crimson clicked from the onset. Mabry led the team in the first set with four kills, while junior co-captain Christina Cornelius contributed an additional three.
While Harvard started off inconsistently in last week’s contest against Tennessee Tech with nine errors in the first set, the Crimson mitigated their mistakes to just two set errors to start off this game.
“I thought we completely controlled the start of the game,” said sophomore hitter Grace Roberts Burbank. “Heading into Ivies, I felt this was a good preparation for that and think the team fought hard and played well today.”
After fighting back to a 13-16 deficit, Boston College fell victim to the firepower of the Harvard offense late in the set. An 8-2 run provided the first set point to the Crimson, with the final score at 25-16.
The second set was more of a back-and-forth battle, with tie scores at 3-3 and 6-6. Gradually, Harvard regained the positive energy of the first set, taking a 17-9 lead midway through set two.
The Eagles used two timeouts during their scoring drought, but these efforts were in vain as the Crimson secured the second set point with a 25-17 finish.
“I think one of the strengths of the team is that we have a really diverse offense,” Roberts Burbank said. “We have weapons all along the net and were happy to contribute what we could.”
The Crimson fell behind 3-7 to start set three, with four of those seven BC points coming from Harvard attack errors. The Eagles maintained their lead at 13-7 at the midway point, and Harvard appeared flustered throughout much of the early parts of the set, especially on the defensive side.
The Crimson rebounded quickly however, and made a valiant attempt at a comeback. Boston College’s main attacking weapons slowed down, allowing for Harvard to build some momentum and rack up a few runs, including narrowing a 22-15 Eagles lead to just four at 24-20.
The odds were stacked up against Harvard with this late set score, but a resilient defense allowed the Crimson to tie the game at 24-24. However, the Eagles rose again, taking the last two points of the game’s most competitive set.
“That was the best we had all fought and it was awesome to feel the energy of the crowd as we tried to come back in that set,” Mabry said. “The whole team was feeling confident even though we gave up the set point. As a freshman, I feel this experience will only make the team stronger.”
In the fourth set, Boston College broke away late and finished with the 25-23 set point. Sophomore hitter Cat Balido dominated in the set and was the main offensive weapon for the Eagles, ultimately finishing with 18 kills.
All signs pointed to a Boston College comeback victory, but Harvard stayed composed and started off the final tiebreaker on a strong note, jumping to a 10-6 lead. Pushing their way forward to 15, the Crimson traded points until the final moments, when two attack errors by Balido helped to seal the fifth set victory.
Overall, Roberts Burbank and Mabry were the leaders on offense, each contributing 16 kills. On defense, the team finished with 46 digs and 33 blocks.
The Crimson will be on short rest following tonight’s nail biter, as they face the Northeastern Huskies Friday night and back home Saturday afternoon against UMass Lowell to close out the weekend series.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earthquakes rarely strike Cambridge, Mass. But on Nov. 19, 2016, the ground shifted at Harvard Stadium.
You may remember the feeling. Crimson football players certainly do.
Eight days earlier, Harvard boasted a 7-1 record. The Crimson needed one win—at Penn or versus Yale—to secure the first four-peat in school history.
But the tectonic plates were already moving. On Nov. 11, the first event took place in Philadelphia when Harvard fell to the Quakers, 27-14. Then came the big one.
During the Game, over 30,000 fans watched as the Crimson’s title hopes crumbled to the ground. Among the wreckage were several precious streaks—nine triumphs over the Bulldogs, six years with eight or more wins, and three championships. Everything shattered.
It would take a school of seismologists and psychologists to unpack the impact of that game. Needless to say, aftershocks continued for months. And needless to say, Harvard has not forgotten.
“We use it as motivation,” junior wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley said. “In every workout during the winter, that’s something we’d bring up—just not to get complacent in everything we do. Last year was a different year for the team.”
Tomorrow at 1 p.m., the Crimson will kick off against Rhode Island. But Harvard isn’t really playing the Rams in Kingstown, R.I. The Crimson is engaged in a trickier business, stiff-arming the demons of the past in hopes of one day outrunning them.
If Harvard were playing Rhode Island, the game would have little intrigue. The Rams sport one winning season in this millennium (2001). The last time that Rhode Island beat the Crimson, none of the current players was alive. No one on earth was alive. That’s because the Rams have never beat Harvard.
Indeed, the best parts of the Rhode Island program are the grass field (beautiful) and the proximity to Cambridge (83 miles). Crimson coach Tim Murphy may highlight the athleticism of the Rams and their improved defense. Even so, Mayweather-McGregor looks like an even match compared to this one.
For the second season, fifth-year senior Joe Viviano will quarterback the Crimson. In the first half of 2016, he threw eight touchdowns without an interception. In the second half, he threw eight interceptions.
That inconsistency led to a quarterback competition this offseason, with Viviano battling junior Tommy Stewart. The veteran retained his starting role, but Murphy didn’t make the decision until last week.
Viviano has many weapons at his disposal. Shelton-Mosley returns as a unanimous selection to the All-Ivy first team. A stud since freshman year, Shelton-Mosley led the Crimson with 568 receiving yards in 2016.
Also back is senior running back Semar Smith, which means that Harvard has kept its leading passer, receiver, and rusher. Don’t let this tagline fool you, though—the offense must overcome a revamped offensive line and the loss of tight end Anthony Firkser.
The strength of the team likely lies in the defense, where captain Luke Hutton leads the linebackers and senior cornerbacks secure the secondary. Upfront, junior defensive lineman D.J. Bailey returns after landing on the All-Ivy second team.
“I wouldn’t say we have any [major] weaknesses on the defense,” Hutton said. “Our ceiling is pretty high.”
Harvard will line up across from Rhode Island quarterback Tyler Harris, a redshirt junior who has already tossed eight interceptions. When Harris targets his own team, he has solid receivers in Aaron Parker (sophomore) and Marven Beauvais (junior), both of whom average over 80 yards a contest.
The Rams also have a steady option in running back Harold Cooper. The senior has put together a celebrated career, totaling close to 2,000 yards on 413 carries. Last season, though, the Crimson limited the rusher to 21 yards.
Despite the 0-2 record, Rhode Island has shown signs of life in 2017. In their season opener, the Rams pushed Central Michigan to overtime before falling, 30-27.
“The struggle has been turnovers—six in the first game and two in the second,” Murphy said. “This is an improved team that’s 0-2…. They’re a very dangerous team and a much different team from the one we played last year.”
Even so, the key battle tomorrow involves no program from Rhode Island. In the season opener, Harvard will face the specter of 2016.
Shelton-Mosley certainly seems ready. Before taking the field, he’ll listen to a final song—“Hills and Valleys,” a Christian ballad about overcoming difficulties.
Those lyrics, and that message, apply to this team.

Still fishing around for extracurriculars to get involved with here at Harvard? Have no fear, Flyby's got a handy visual to help you figure out what club you're best suited for. (Hint: Comp Flyby!)

Dear Freshmen,
Let’s get something out of the way first: Harvard is not a party school, despite some well-respected efforts. As much as you hope that dorm party you were invited to will be a rager, or that the CEB-hosted parties will rival those at state schools, trust us when we say it all goes downhill once some couple making out pins you between the wall and a Harvard-issue standing lamp. When you manage to escape (and you eventually will, once your valiant friends respond to that urgent “HELP” text message), it will take you 45 minutes of squeezing through a sea of sweaty people chatting poli-sci before you even reach the “bar” (which is actually just a dresser). We’re not trying to kill your mood, we’re just being honest.
So, here’s a few things to keep in mind when you’re searching for a place to sport your new crop top or Vineyard Vines salmon shorts, (but, Dean Dingman help us, not your lanyards).
In essence, every final club is the exact same arrangement of individuals a little too dressed up for a glorified frat party and music that stopped being good two months ago. Also, you are not special for getting in. If you loiter outside the Spee for 35 minutes, you’ll eventually find a window to sneak in. That is, unless you identify as a male, then good luck kid, it’s not going to happen. Don’t you dare consider skewing the ratio. You can find Citrus-flavor Rubinoff somewhere else.
If you think this dorm party is going to be different, it won’t be, especially if it’s hosted by your freshman entryway’s resident bros. After the 40th person crams themselves into a closet-sized double, the dreaded proc-knock is only moments away. Not to mention, you’ll have to keep running into that kid you made out with on the First Chance Dance floor and you’re not very good at avoiding eye contact. If—no, when—the party inevitably ends at 11 p.m., stop by El Jefe’s to at least end the evening on a positive note.
You will go to the quad for a party, and the round-trip travel time will amount to more than the actual time spent partying. This is a guarantee. Also, the shuttle is an urban legend that cannot be trusted.
Freshman Fall is when you will have the most motivation to go out. As it gets colder, your tolerance gets higher, and classes get harder, your will to party will die a slow, painful death. So, don’t get too frustrated now. Take whatever dubs you can get. Remember, it’s not the parties you go to, but the friends (or mobs of fellow party-thirsty freshmen) you meet along the way.
Godspeed,
Flyby

Cambridge is home to only 100,000 people, so you’d think it would be easier to find some peace and quiet. But no, like any good educational institution, Harvard is full of annoying distractions. No matter what House you live in, you’ve probably complained about—or been woken up by—one of these.
Lowell Construction
The best part about Lowell House being renovated this year was that the bells don’t ring. But it seems Harvard wanted to make sure no resident of the Square missed Lowell being noisy af, because the construction is just as bad. And it’s bad all day long. Forget about even trying to take a midday nap.
Your Roommate’s Fifth Snooze
Considering that you and your roommate are squashed into a double so small you’re practically in the same bed, your roommate should be a little more sensitive about how annoying their alarm is. Every morning, they wake up for an 8 a.m. class—or, try to wake up, because they keep hitting snooze. One more time and you’ll drag them out of bed.
Garbage Trucks in the Quad
Picture this: you’re away from the chaos of the Square. It’s 9 a.m., you’re asleep, you feel great...and then the garbage truck beeps outside your window. And then it keeps beeping. For ten minutes. You don’t even need to set your own alarm at this point. Seriously, those things are moseying around the Quad for what seems like hours. Is the beeping necessary?!
The Tour Group Outside Your Window
For anyone living in a freshman dorm, this is literally as bad as a jackhammer. Get ready to scream when the tour guide says, “Wigglesworth! Isn’t that a weird name? Say it with me!” and then the entire tour group shouts, “WIGGLESWORTH!”
If your morning has just begun and you hear one of these...grab your headphones, or a very fluffy pillow. It’s going to be a long, long day. Godspeed, my friends.
