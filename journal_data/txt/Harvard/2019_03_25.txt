After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My thesis is finally turned in, and the end is at last in sight. Senior Gift Marshals will soon begin their polite and persistent requests for donations to the Senior Class Gift, our extracurriculars will collect our post-Harvard contact info, and we will become part of the Harvard alum network on what is hopefully a sunny afternoon in May. Before and after we vacate our dorms, we will be constantly petitioned for financial support for Harvard and our assorted extracurriculars and teams.
Our attitudes toward the Senior Gift and other similar requests to give back spark a critical conversation about what we believe we owe to Harvard, if we believe we owe anything at all. We often have understandable hesitations regarding our own financial constraints or ethical quandaries of forking over money to the “Great Capitalist Satan” or “Kremlin on the Charles.” We want to know why such a rich institution even needs our gifts, and want to guarantee that our gifts will be impactful.
I do not claim that every single senior should give at least something to Senior Gift or that every alum should donate something, nor that every student’s Harvard experience merits a display of gratitude. I recognize that even a small donation would be a real financial burden for some of my classmates. But I would argue that some of the assumptions behind our hesitations about giving are not as altruistic or as authentic as we imagine them to be.
The opinion that most of us owe something to Harvard and that some signal of gratitude is worthwhile is not likely to be a popular one. By the time we graduate, most of us will feel that Harvard did nothing but take and take and take from us, draining our time, emotional well-being, and resources. None of us expected this journey to be easy, but few of us expected it to be so hard, so often.
But I am, thankfully, not nearly the same person I was freshman year, nor are my friends and peers the same people they were freshman year. We are perhaps more cynical or burnt out, but we have grown, we have become stronger, and we have become something far more than our freshman selves. The conversations that have changed my life, the experiences on campus and far beyond that have let me see the world past my home, they just wouldn’t have happened without Harvard.
Insofar as Senior Gift and other campaigns are often framed as gift-giving, our seemingly prudent and wise desire to guarantee good stewardship of our funds misses the very nature of a gift. When we give birthday gifts to our friends, for instance, we don’t stand over them and say, “Now, this is what I want you to use it for! If you don’t use it in this way, I will not give it to you! Actually, your salary is much higher than mine, so I might not get you anything in the first place!”
When we give a gift, we are ultimately not concerned with the substance of the gift itself, even though we want to ideally give something useful or generous. We are not concerned with how it will or will not be used. We are usually not concerned with whether the person is absolutely deserving of some kind of material blessing in the first place.
We give because we care about the recipient and want to express our affections in a tangible way. A gift is first and foremost a reflection of the giver’s disposition to the receiver. I know that giving back to Harvard is not quite the same as giving to another person. But our experience here was made up of professors, classmates, beloved friends, and even challenging peers. It was made up of their vivid ideas, colorful stories, late night talks, and intellectual tests. Our Harvard experience was made up of people, people who we could spend an eternity repaying for their influence on our lives.
Therefore, I believe that I owe something to Harvard for everything that its students and teachers have given me. I want the doors that opened to me here to be open to students who come after me, and even more so. I know that what I can give financially or with my time will not go very far, and I know that Harvard doesn’t really need what pittance I can offer. But those hesitations will not be on my mind when I write that first check. Rather, I will think on the wisdom, joy, and laughter that I have shared in well-loved dorms and dining halls over the past few years, earnestly hoping that the next occupant of my soon-to-be-empty room will also delight in their seat at Harvard’s table.

What is wrong with Harvard? This is a staple question in many interview and club applications. For many clubs I applied to, I was asked in interview after interview to lament every possible one of Harvard’s shortcomings, and I’ve heard similar conversations occurring in other places around campus. Yes, perhaps there are some reasons to complain. In fact, the list goes on — roommates making noise at 3 a.m., ten-minutes of waiting for the non-existent water flow of my sink to rinse my toothbrush clean, and of course, the chronic, constant anxiety everyone here seems to experience, our collective inability to separate work from home.
Any of us can name various things that have bothered us in our few months or three years here, but what is the point? Do we ever solve our problems by moping about our dorms, unfair situations, and busy schedules?
On campus, I often hear passersby complain about their clubs, their classes, their meal from Harvard University Dining Services. Yet they still involve themselves in the very activities they criticize. Pre-meds will take classes they despise, while others will pursue boring internships for the sake of adding a line on their LinkedIn account. People who came to Harvard hoping to win a Nobel Prize will decide to give Wall Street a chance, not because they suddenly become interested in finance, but because it seems like the way to get a leg up. Though venting can be useful our constant habit of complaining only cultivates a culture of finding the bad in life, refusing to see new perspectives, and avoiding the beautiful things happening around us. Although asking “What’s wrong with Harvard?” originates as a call to improvement, our responses often manifest as an optimal opportunity to allow our negativity to consume us.
While we should seek to improve our lives, we should also embrace what we love doing, and move towards fixing our issues with anything within our ability. Although it is certainly easier to simply acknowledge Harvard’s imperfections, we should seek to improve our surroundings in a more direct, actionable manner. Clubs, such as those affiliated with the Phillips Brooks House Association and the Institute of Politics’ public service initiatives, are making great strides in helping our environment, increasing voter turnout, and engaging young kids with their passions and democracy at large. These groups are solving some of our society’s greatest issues. So for the many of us out there who have complaints, let us change the question we are always asking. Rather than ask “What’s wrong with Harvard?” let us ask “How can we improve Harvard?”
Only through this shift in mentality will we start noticing the positive changes occurring around us daily. We will all remember that every person on campus has diverse passions. Everyone has something they care about. Everyone has something they can bring to the table. Many of our problems with the College stem from an expectation that everything needs to be already perfect, already in place, but we, as students who attend Harvard should be the individuals the action driving what is happening around us. We can fix things and our acknowledgement of problems is our call to fix it. Each student here should find causes important to them and working towards their goals. Moving forward, we need to create a campus that can see more than the scandals and our differences. We all come from different backgrounds and live by varying morals, but together, this is our chance to fix things.
Pessimism can spread like wildfire, but positivity can serve as a powerful extinguisher. We should learn to look on the bright side and identify what we can improve and what makes life interesting. There is no one correct way to fix our problems, but complaining without acting is certainly not the first step toward change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ongoing negotiations between Harvard and the newly-formed graduate student union have raised many issues regarding graduate students’ quality of life, such as access to internal arbitration policies and professional development resources. While the complexities of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers’ demands and the University’s resource constraints make the negotiation process nuanced and complex, we hope that both sides are able to come together in a productive and speedy manner that is as fair as it can be to all involved.
One issue that has taken center stage in the ongoing contract negotiations is the union’s insistence on a provision that would allow members to pursue a neutral third-party grievance procedure to arbitrate complaints of sexual harassment and discrimination. The University has expressed multiple concerns about this proposal, claiming that a third-party arbitration process would lack the “thoroughness, fair play, and due process” of its own internal policies.
We disagree with the University on this issue. Given Harvard’s lamentable history in dealing with cases of sexual misconduct, notably in cases like that of Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez, we broadly agree with HGSU-UAW on the need for a neutral arbitration procedure to review grievances brought against the University with regard to discrimination and sexual misconduct. Given the many ways in which students can and have been discriminated against on this campus historically, we do not believe that Harvard should have sole oversight in internal cases brought against its affiliates. We have repeatedly stated that the University must rethink and refocus its internal culture and policies with regard to sexual harassment, and we feel that other instances of discrimination — on the basis of race or disability status, for instance — must be treated in a similarly impartial manner.
We understand that there are significant legal and ethical complexities that would be involved with a major institutional shift of this nature, and any new changes, including the potential creation of a third-party grievance procedure, must be studied with care. However, Harvard’s own grievance procedures and resources can be seen as complicated for those forced to navigate them. Students already battling to seek justice for assault or discrimination must not be asked to fight on two fronts — one against the accused and another against uncooperative institutions. It bears repeating: Sexual assault — not to mention discrimination on the basis of a host of different factors — occurs with troubling frequency to many on this campus. We hope that both parties eventually come to an agreement to help process future occurrences in a way that is acceptable to all.
We also wish to show our respect on a personal level for the graduate students who are negotiating with the University on behalf of HGSU-UAW. We consider their actions to be selfless and admirable, especially because they seek to not only better their own situations, but also those of students who come after them, given that any contract that is finalized will likely far outlast their own time as Harvard students.
In light of all this, as we have expressed in the past, we continue to hope that University representatives keep the best interests of graduate students at heart and that both parties continue to pursue these negotiations in good faith.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED April 7, 2019 at 9:38 p.m.
Experts say it is unclear how President Donald Trump’s recent executive order conditioning certain federal funds to universities based on their free speech policies will affect Harvard given the order's vague nature and unclear enforcement mechanisms.
Trump — who promised in a speech in early March to sign such an order — was surrounded by conservative student activists and cabinet members at a White House ceremony Thursday, as he declared the federal government will not give money to universities that “do not allow you to speak.” The order aims to promote “free and open debate” on college campuses across the country.
"The heads of covered agencies shall… take appropriate steps, in a manner consistent with applicable law, including the First Amendment, to ensure institutions that receive Federal research or education grants promote free inquiry, including through compliance with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, and policies,” the order reads.
Legal experts have criticized the order’s ambiguity, noting that it is unclear how it will be enforced in practice. In fact, its ambiguity may even threaten its constitutionality, according to University of California, Berkeley Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky.
“It's unconstitutional because the law is clear that any conditions on federal funds have to be explicitly stated, and this is so ambiguous that no college administrator can know what he or she can and can't do without risking federal funds,” Chemerinsky said.
Because Harvard is a private university, the federal government does not have the authority to dictate its free speech policies — but the government can create conditions for the University to receive federal funding.
In 2018, Harvard received $622 million in federal research funding. Thursday’s order could affect nearly all of that. The agencies covered by the order, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Health, comprise more than 95 percent of Harvard’s federal funding. Grants from the National Institutes of Health — which is part of the Department of Health — make up over 70 percent of the University’s government funding.
In recent years, the free speech debate at Harvard has been driven in part by the Open Campus Initiative, an organization launched in 2016 to “test” the University’s commitment to free speech by inviting controversial speakers to campus.
OCI invited controversial sociologist Charles A. Murray ’65 — whose theory that race can be linked to IQ has been denounced as “racist pseudoscience” by the Southern Poverty Law Center — to speak at the Harvard Mineralogical and Geological Museum in September 2017. The University paid the Cambridge Police Department $12,000 to provide Murray with heavy security at the event, which some students criticized as providing a platform for racist ideology.
Alexis M. Mealey ’21, the current president of OCI, said in early March that the proposed order left her “conflicted,” given that in her view, the extent of free speech restriction varies between institutions. At Harvard there is not a “huge need” for government intervention, she argued.
“It’s totally outside of his power as President of the United States to threaten to withdraw federal funding from universities,” she said. “But I also think that any steps we can take to improve a greater range of speech are steps that should be considered, perhaps not in the capacity that he is proposing.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain pointed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s October 2018 inauguration address, in which the newly elected president said it was important that Harvard promote “ideological diversity” and protect the “freedom to speak one’s mind.”
“The University’s commitment to the free exchange of ideas and freedom of expression is well established,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement. “As such, this action is unnecessary and inappropriately links an already strong commitment to free speech to a ‘to-be-determined’ process around federal research grants.”
Richard Parker, a lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School, said the executive order constituted a “red-meat idea for young conservatives.” Still, Parker — who co-founded the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones — said Harvard has suppressed free speech in past decades.
He pointed to administrators’ decision to deny tenure to two economics professors in the mid-1930s — known as the “Walsh-Sweezy controversy” — in a move that sparked allegations of ideological discrimination against socialist ideas.
Experts also said the executive order’s perceived partisan motivations may undermine its efficacy. University of Florida Professor Clay Calvert, who directs the university’s First Amendment Project, wrote in an email that the order may not have any practical effect because it requires public universities to abide by the First Amendment, which they are already legally required to do. Private universities set their own free speech policies.
Calvert wrote that the order constitutes “executive overkill to score political points.”
“Trump’s order clearly panders to his political base, which perceives a pall of political correctness cast over many college campuses,” Calvert wrote. “I worry that what's going to happen is that the President is going to take some instance where he doesn't like what a college is doing and say they should lose their federal money.”
Correction: April 7, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the order covers agencies that make up 25 percent of Harvard's federal funding. In fact, the order covers agencies that comprise more than 95 percent of Harvard's federal funding.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard filed a motion on March 8 to dismiss a lawsuit it currently faces alleging it was negligent in the care of Luke Z. Tang ’18, an undergraduate who died by suicide in 2015.
In the motion the University argued that it and its employees did not fail to meet any “duty of reasonable care” and that the plaintiff’s allegations do not prove Harvard caused Tang’s death. They argue that Harvard employees did not have reason to believe Tang was at increased risk of suicide in the months before he died.
Luke Tang’s father, Wendell W. Tang, filed the wrongful death lawsuit against the University and several of its employees in the Middlesex County Superior Court in November 2018, roughly three years after his son’s death.
The lawsuit names the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — as well as residential dean Catherine R. Shapiro, Lowell House Resident Dean Caitlin Casey, Harvard University Health Services mental health counselor Melanie G. Northrop, and HUHS psychiatrist David W. Abramson and accuses each of them of “negligence and carelessness.” The suit argues their actions directly resulted in Luke Tang’s death and calls for monetary damages of at least $20 million.
Harvard’s motion references the 2018 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision in Nguyen v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in which the plaintiff accused MIT of negligence in his son’s suicide.
In that case, the Court found that colleges do not have a “generalized duty to prevent suicide.” Rather, it held that universities must take measures only in certain circumstances. These include cases when administrators are aware of suicidal ideation or previous suicide attempts by a student.
Harvard’s lawyers argue Wendell Tang’s lawsuit does not meet the standards established in the 2018 case for proving the University and its employees were negligent in failing to prevent Luke Tang’s death.
In addition to the motion to dismiss, Harvard filed a supporting memorandum citing state case law to bolster its argument. The document argues that administrators met the standard of care required by the Court because they addressed Luke Tang’s first suicide attempt by transporting him to McLean Hospital. It also alleges that, contrary to the complaint, Harvard administrators were not aware that Luke Tang continued to have suicidal ideation after his time at McLean.
“[Wendell Tang] has not pled facts identifying any subsequent events that would have triggered a new duty to [Luke] Tang after the spring semester ended and immediately prior to his death in the fall,” the filing reads.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Dane has previously declined to comment on the case, citing its pending status.
Wendell Tang’s lawyers filed a response opposing Harvard’s motion on March 8, arguing that Harvard assumed a legal obligation of care under the precedent set in the Nguyen v. MIT case. They argued that the named Harvard employees in the case individually had voluntary “special relationships” with Luke Tang and knew that he continued to struggle with suicidal ideation in the months preceding his death.
The lawyers included a draft of a 2015 “contract” outlining the terms for Luke Tang’s treatment during his time at the College. They argued the contract demonstrates Harvard failed to meet its obligations of care.
Harvard previously informed the court that it intended to file a motion to dismiss on behalf of itself and its employees, including Shapiro and Casey, on Jan. 16. Abramson filed a motion to dismiss separately on Jan. 18.
That same day, Northrop denied the allegations against her and requested a jury trial. Northrop’s filing specifically aimed to refute allegations that she had a special relationship with Luke Tang or could have foreseen and prevented his death.
The original schedule for the suit listed March 11 as a deadline for the court to hold hearings on certain motions, including motions to dismiss. The court has not yet filed further documents in the case docket, and the ultimate outcome of the two parties’ filings remains uncertain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down three, with just under fifteen seconds left in the game clock, the ball was given to the team’s sharpshooter, junior guard Katie Benzan. She hoisted a triple, attempting to tie the game and preserve Harvard’s chance of extending their season. Unfortunately for the Crimson, Georgetown guard Dionna White blocked Benzan’s shot, effectively ending the team’s hopes of advancing to Round 3 of the WNIT.
This past Sunday, Harvard (17-14, 9-5 Ivy) saw an end to its WNIT run after losing to Georgetown (17-15, 9-9 BIG) in a tight contest at Lavietes Pavilion. The game was a tale of two halves for the Crimson.
After a dominant offensive start by the Hoyas, Harvard fell by double digits at the half. With a new defensive game plan and a switch to more inside scoring, the Crimson came back in the second half and took a one point lead before ultimately losing by a score of 70-65.
The game started with the Hoyas stifling the Harvard offense. The Crimson did not score for the first four minutes of the game and Georgetown jumped to a 6-0 lead. Inside scoring from junior forward Jeanne Boehm helped lead the Harvard offense early but the Hoyas’ jump shooting in the first quarter helped them jump out to a 16-11 lead.
“We played a jump defense the entire game, and leaving their shooters wide open was not the game plan,” Coach Delaney-Smith said. “There should have been a little better effort to get them out of their comfort zone.”
Georgetown only had two players score in the first quarter; guards Dionna White and Nikola Kovacikova. White’s scoring would continue to trouble the Harvard defense throughout the game as she capitalized off turnovers and scored in transition.
“11 had quite a game for Georgetown,” Delaney- Smith said. “I don’t think we played 11 well in the first half. She went coast to coast, she picked out pocket. We weren’t taking her out of her zone and she’s an incredible player.”
In the second quarter, the Hoyas continued to get steals and take advantage of Crimson turnovers. Georgetown also took advantage of Harvard on the boards in the second quarter, getting second chance points off of their offensive rebounds. The Crimson was held to a 30% shooting clip at the end of the half.
“I think we started off not shooting well,” Boehm said. “We usually start out shooting from the arc pretty well and it didn’t turn out that way. Their athleticism and quickness bothered us a little bit and we had trouble connecting on some passes and were turning the ball over too much.”
Harvard’s shooting began to improve as the second period waned but the Hoyas always had an answer. The Crimson went into the half with a double-digit deficit, losing by a score of 37-26.
In the second half, Boehm’s inside presence and sophomore forward Jadyn Bush’s rebounding led the offensive charge for Harvard. Katie Benzan also had two triples in the quarter that helped swing the momentum and cut the deficit to single digits. The Crimson went into the final period down 53-47.
“What we did better in the second half than what we’ve done in a long time is actually read each other and have an inside,” Delaney-Smith said. “Jeannie decided to be the player we know she can be. We were moving the ball and got the shots we wanted.”
Inside scoring continued to be the key to Harvard’s comeback in the fourth quarter. Boehm had seven points and three rebounds in the period that allowed the Crimson deficit to decrease. With just under three minutes remaining, senior guard Madeline Raster weaved through the defense to give Harvard its first lead of the game.
“We noticed pretty early that the inside was open and the guards down the stretch did a great job of getting the ball inside, ” Boehm said. “The opportunities were there and we did a great job of taking advantage of that. “
In the final minutes of the game, the two teams increased their defensive intensity and Harvard maintained its one point lead. With thirty seconds remaining, Georgetown retook the lead off of a breakaway basket. They held the Crimson scoreless in the final seconds and made their free throws down the stretch to clinch the game 70-65.
This game was the seniors’ last of the season, and their leadership and experience were critical to Harvard’s success this season. Seniors Madeline Raster, Sydney Skinner, Nani Redford, and Kelsey Bogdan were all integral pieces whose legacies will endure and whose talents will be missed next season.
“They’re a real hard-working senior class,” Delaney-Smith said. “They came early, they stayed late, they worked on their game. It’s a class we’ll miss for sure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team bowed out of the NIT and concluded its 2018-19 season on Sunday night, falling short of another upset victory over ACC side NC State.
Both junior Bryce Aiken and freshman Noah Kirkwood tallied 19 points apiece in a game which featured 11 lead changes in the second half. The Crimson had an opportunity to tie or re-take the lead with 17 seconds remaining after an offensive rebound off an Aiken missed free throw, but Wolfpack guard Braxton Beverly denied the Crimson guard on his triple attempt.
A last-second three from Rio Haskett was not enough to salvage the visiting side, as Harvard walked off the court for the final time in front of an electrifying sold-out crowd of 5,500 at Reynolds Coliseum.
“Really tough loss for us — this is an amazing environment, it’s my first time back in many years and seeing how this is transformed, I thought the energy with the crowd was such a boost for their kids,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, who played at Reynolds Coliseum while at Duke for four seasons. “Kevin [Keatts] has done such a wonderful job in how they play, they are very hard to defend. We couldn’t really guard them off the bounce.”
A combination of strong offensive rebounding in the game(17) as well as forced turnovers(17) was crucial for a Wolfpack side. Keatts’ side pressured the Crimson throughout the contest with a full-court press and limited Aiken to six conversions over 18 attempts in its 78-77 win.
“As I watched the Georgetown game, I knew those guys were pretty good,” Keatts said. “Obviously what they do is they spread you out, they run a lot of ball screens, they have motion. And they have a legitimate post that can score inside. We went into the game saying that if we were going to have a chance to win the game, we had to do a great job on Bryce Aiken. I told them that [Aiken] had to shoot a bad percentage to get his points.”
The Harvard point guard did have scoring relief in this contest, including a perfect 7-of-7 outing from classmate Chris Lewis inside and a 8-of-12 showing from the aforementioned Kirkwood. Lewis added four blocks to his name on the night — tying his personal-best — while teammate Robert Baker also logged three rejections.
But the Wolfpack’s late push to hold a slight lead throughout the final nine minutes opened up to a five-point margin approaching the final 30 seconds, proving too big of a hill for the Crimson to climb.
No player from NC State — outside of a brief hot streak from Markell Johnson and CJ Bryce — had a standout performance, but it was the balanced effort posed by numerous offensive weapons that made the difference. The Wolfpack shot below 30 percent from the extended three-point line, but five players tallied double-figures in the tightly-contested battle.
“Certainly I thought in the second half how much they got on the backboard made a huge difference,” Amaker said. “I was proud of our kids of the effort they put forth and making this an interesting game going all the way down to the wire. But not enough to beat a really good basketball team.”
The Crimson conclude its season with a 19-12 overall record and an appearance in the NIT second round for the first time in program history. Harvard will add its seventh regular-season championship to the banners at Lavietes Pavilion, and return just about all of its scoring for the next campaign.
“I’m proud of what we were able to accomplish this year,” Amaker said. “We didn’t do all that we wanted but certainly were able to accomplish a lot with what we went through with injuries and different things within our team...overall when we get a chance to reflect and digest it all, I think we accomplished a lot but not as much as we wanted.”

The 2018-2019 Crimson. After losing important forward Ryan Donato to the NHL, one of the major obstacles facing Harvard to start the year was replacing the scoring void left by Donato, an Olympian and Hobey Baker Hat Trick finalist in 2018. Ultimately, a talented crop of freshmen was poised to help make up for this loss — and then some. More uncertainty lay in the crease: Merrick Madsen '18, one of the program's most decorated net-minders, had graduated, and the starting spot was senior Michael Lackey's to lose. Time would tell whether Lackey was up to the challenge of commanding Harvard's number-one post.
The Crimson’s campaign did not begin as planned. The season-opener at Ivy League rival Dartmouth saw numerous defensive breakdowns lead to seven goals allowed for Lackey, the last of which was the overtime winner for the Big Green. The loss overshadowed a five-point night (1–4—5) from junior defenseman Adam Fox, who entered the season on the short list of Hobey Baker Award contenders. The following week, a ranked Quinnipiac team came to Cambridge for Harvard’s home-opener. The Bobcats overwhelmed the Crimson, which had turned to backup goaltender Cameron Gornet after Lackey’s sub-par outing at Dartmouth. Harvard’s worthiness of elite status, as well as its stability between the pipes, remained to be seen.
The Crimson icemen began to improve their play, but the results were reluctant to fall in their favor. Following the loss to Quinnipiac, Harvard skated to a 4-4 tie with a top-heavy Princeton squad. The team carried its winless record into Yale's Ingalls Rink, where an age-old rivalry tilt would put the Crimson to the test.
Just like the home contest with the Tigers, a heated affair at "The Whale" in New Haven, Conn., ended in a draw. The tie marked the first time in program history that Harvard stood without a win through its first four regular-season games.
In mid-November, most students' attention turned to the annual Harvard-Yale football clash. Meanwhile, the Crimson was busy entertaining Arizona St., a team that surprised many pundits with its high-caliber play this season, in a weekend series. The sides split the back-to-back, but importantly, Lackey began to take form after a rocky start to the year.
Over Thanksgiving break, Harvard faced off in one of the marquee games on its schedule: a battle with its most intense college hockey rival, Cornell, under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. America's most historic arena provided a dramatic setting for Lackey's coming-out party (1 GA, .968 SV%), which powered the Crimson to victory and gave the group its most impressive win to date.
The keystone triumph at the Frozen Apple steered Harvard in the right direction. But the Big Red got its revenge the next weekend, stifling the Crimson at its home rink, the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Harvard rang in the new year with a series of mixed results: a draw with Boston University and a loss to Princeton followed victories against less talented foes Bentley and RPI. On Jan. 12, however, the Crimson logged its most monumental win of the season against then-No. 6 Quinnipiac, righting the ship and elevating team confidence to a new high. Lackey stood on his head that night, posting 46 saves (1 GA, .979 SV%) en route to the best performance of his career. With a go-to option in net, Harvard could squash its early-season question mark and rally to a stellar second half of the campaign.
In late January, the Crimson put forth another inspiring performance. Sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh defeated a top-10 Clarkson team with his overtime winner off a faceoff play, adding another key win to his squad's PairWise resume. The victory put Harvard back on track after it dropped another ECAC matchup to Cornell, this time at the famed Lynah Rink in Ithaca, N.Y., the week prior. It also marked the inception of a seven-game home win streak that took the Crimson all the way through its conference quarterfinal sweep of Dartmouth in late March.
As classes resumed on campus, the Big Green visited Harvard looking to claim the season series against the Crimson for the first time since 2012-2013. Harvard had other plans, though, rattling off four unanswered goals after entering the first intermission down by a score. The victory continued a small but meaningful streak of four consecutive wins into the month of February — a jam-packed month for Boston's hockey elite.
Mid-February came around and, as always, so did the Beanpot Tournament. Boston's annual college hockey showcase offered Harvard a chance to return to the title game after missing out in 2018. Alas, the Crimson bowed out to Boston College in the semifinal round, mustering just one goal — especially disappointing for such a prolific offense. Lackey remained sturdy, though, and coach Ted Donato '91 and his group had no choice but to move on with their conference schedule to close out the year.
The Beanpot defeat did not derail Harvard from its spurt of formidable play. The Friday between Beanpot rounds, the Crimson bested another threatening ECAC foe, then-ranked Union. The Harvard powerplay, the brainchild of assistant coach Rob Rassey, went 4-for-4 with the man advantage and furthered its national lead in execution rate with an automatic performance.
The Crimson did win its Beanpot consolation match, placing third in the tournament for the second stright season. It then embarked on its yearly "North Country" road trip to Clarkson and St. Lawrence, where it nabbed a comeback win over the Saints before dropping an important contest with the Golden Knights. The greatest loss of the weekend, however, was the loss of Lackey to knee injury. The senior had bucked his doubters and posted a superb regular season before exiting the Clarkson game in its middle frame, visibly shaken up after a net-front collision. Lackey would miss the remainder of the regular season and Harvard's conference quarterfinal series against Dartmouth while nursing the injury.
Gornet, filling in for the ailing Lackey, was excellent during his stretch of six starts (5-1-0, 1.83 GAA, .938 SV%), keeping the Crimson's NCAA Tournament hopes alive. The St. Louis, Mo., native is pictured here receiving the Tim Taylor Cup for most outstanding player of the annual Harvard-Yale game at the Bright, and an injured Lackey, sadly unable to dress for his class' senior night, can be seen in the background supporting his fill-in.
After shutting out the Bulldogs on Feb. 23, the Crimson honored its six seniors. Co-captains Michael Floodstrand and Lewis Zerter-Gossage comprise the nominal leadership but are flanked by classmates Adam Baughman, Viktor Dombrovskiy, Jacob Olson, and Lackey. The class of 2019 has won a Beanpot title, played in the Frozen Four, and will make its third NCAA Tournament appearance this week.
The regular season has come and gone. Harvard's 17-9-3 record was good enough to seize a top-20 USCHO ranking for the first time since November of 2017. A 13-7-2 slate in the ECAC earned the team a first-round bye in the conference playoffs, and a 2-0 sweep of Dartmouth in the quarterfinals sent the Crimson back to Lake Placid for the fifth consecutive season.
Despite a loss to Clarkson in the ECAC semifinal, the program made the NCAA Tournament and has drawn one-seed UMass in the Regional semifinal. Storylines from the regular season, such as the dazzling play of Hobey Baker candidate Adam Fox and the search for stability between the pipes, will likely persist into the national tournament.

Now that spring break is over and the dust has settled, without further introduction, here are the 12 Housing Day videos ranked by a professional in the field (aka, a tired freshman who watches too many vine compilations).
1) Adams 
Chances are, you’ve heard at least one person randomly bring up the Adams Housing Day video during section. Rightfully so, of course. Adams is the clear winner this year, with the insanely impressive lyricism and video editing that give its video a professional feel. Everything about it is so smooth yet witty, which made all the freshmen this year rap along (yes, including the yeehaw verse).
Rating: 5 stars for the sampling during the second half, the entire kitchen scene, and the jab at Kirkland’s flag.
2) Lowell
Raps are definitely a common theme this year, and Lowell didn’t disappoint by flexing about its new and shiny house. The scenes are filled with tea drinking and cool transitions, and everyone really can’t help but be jealous about its renovations and abundance of singles.
Rating: 4.8 stars for comparing Mather House to a block, the violin scene, and skillful use of confetti.
3) Currier
Currier was admirably realistic enough to depict a disappointed freshman getting his/her house, but it made sure to show us its community side to compensate. The video has a lot of aesthetic House shots, and the beat change in the middle keeps it lively and entertaining. “Mamma Mia!” is always a solid way to go.
Rating: 4.3 stars for the singing chorus and people brave enough to wear a dress outside.
4) Cabot
Shoutout to Cabot for bringing its fish to life! Cabot’s spin on “Fergalicious” was fun and lively: It was filled with subtle flexes about having the one and only Dean Khurana and being ranked highly on senior surveys. Different spaces like the iconic Cabot Café were featured, and the -icious rhymes were abundant and creative.
Rating: 4.2 stars for the fish suit and a dancing Dean Khurana.
5) Eliot
Eliot made sure to flex its swipe access powers and its annual “Fête” event through a heavy beat. Seeing female representation in the newly invented Harvard rapping scene is great, and the bold moves and dramatic zoom-ins just made us love it even more.
Rating: 4.1 stars for random “Charles!” exclamation and the gym flex.
6) Pfoho
Instead of showing anything about its house, Pfoho used its Housing Day video to follow the enchanting adventure of a polar bear — but we’re not complaining. It was pretty funny to watch the polar bear hunt for “riverlings” in order to feed her vulnerable freshman cubs.
Rating: 4.1 stars for a unique layout and the David Attenborough voice.
7) Mather 
More female rappers bring the heat in Mather’s Housing Day video, letting us know that freshmen are welcome with Mather’s lack of dining restrictions and very cute dogs. Actually winning intramurals is always a good flex too.
Rating: 3.9 stars for the Conan O’Brien poster and the yellow clout sunglasses.
8) Winthrop
Though many of the housing videos used rapping, two houses used Ariana Grande songs to show off the ways they are better. Winthrop’s video follows the lead singer gleefully thanking Winthrop alongside local residents, with the lion mascot lurking in the back or dancing on tables. Overall, it was upbeat and fun.
Rating: 3.8 stars for the intro sequence, House views, and burn book.
9) Leverett 
Leverett also brought us rapping that uses Cardi B as a solid starting template. With “IM’s in the bag” and scenes on the bridge, it’s entertaining and makes good points. The Spanish verse is cute too.
Rating: 3.7 stars for the fur coat and subtle bunny twerking.
10) Quincy
Quincy made a bop sung in minor feel lighter with all the penguin costumes, and most of the scenes featured pretty good dancing in random places around the house. Got the song stuck in my head again, though.
Rating: 3.6 stars for penguin dancing.
11) Dunster
Dunster has had a great track record, with past videos including Another Day of Dunster and Holding Out for Dunster. This year’s Fairly OddParents storyline is a solid idea but got a little lost in translation. For such a bougie house, Dunster could also have used more than just shots of the library and the dining hall.
Rating: 3 stars for the delicious food and adorable kid.
12) Kirkland
Kirkland’s Housing Day video consists of one guy randomly walking to places while pointing and shrugging. Does anyone ever understand Kirkland Housing Day videos? The harmonizing of voices could have been worse — when they weren’t busy laughing.
Rating: 1 star for the (British?) accent.
