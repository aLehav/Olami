After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The female heads of three of Harvard’s most prominent political organizations spoke in Boylston Hall last night, reflecting on their experiences serving in elected office and offering advice about how to pursue political success to the mostly female audience.  
The presidents of the Undergraduate Council, the Harvard College Democrats, and the Institute of Politics offered their thoughts as part of the Women’s Center’s “Women’s Week 2009: Engendering Change.”
Many of the stories shared by the panelists were tales of difficulty.  
UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 recalled a male member of the UC telling her, “You only won secretary because you’re a cute girl,” after she won an internal UC election. 
“He, like, crushed my day,” she added.
IOP President Mary K. B. Cox ’10 said that she entered her organization without a deep knowledge of politics.
“Most of the people there were men who had known about politics and had known about politics their whole lives,” she said.
Including Cox, the last three IOP presidents have been women. Eva Z. Lam ’10, the president of the Dems, said that for the last four years men and woman have been alternating in the position of president. 
Although the IOP and the Dems have roughly equal membership between the sexes, only one-third of UC representatives are female. 
Although three out of the Council’s four top spots are currently held by women, there is only one freshman woman on the Council.
During yesterday’s panel discussion, audience member Danielle M. Gram ’11 said her female friends questioned whether she was “fierce” enough to run for a secretary position in the Dems.
“You shouldn’t have to be seen as fierce,” responded Lam. “What about being the secretary of the Harvard College Democrats would require you to be fierce?”
Cox was careful to qualify the advice.
“Of course, we’re trading in stereotypes here, so there are individual exceptions to all of this,” she said.
When two men in the audience got up to leave toward the end of the event, Lam called for a round of applause for the men in the audience.
Lam later said that if she walked into a room outnumbered to the extent that the men were, she would feel “a little uncomfortable.”
“I think it’s really, really important that men as well as women are talking about the role of women in office,” she said.

The Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School has launched a new Web site, Mediacloud.org, that will allow scholars and Internet users to monitor the flow of news and ideas online. 
The service will provide data on how news stories spread around the Internet through both blogs and mainstream media outlets, and may help to answer important questions about the forces shaping popular discourse.
Aiming to give media scholars and watch-dogs more comprehensive data, the new tool automatically downloads text from blogs and newspapers and then categorizes the stories by content, sorting them into a searchable database. 
The Web site will allow researchers to compare how different news organizations in the United States and abroad cover stories, offering new insight as to how blogs and online news outlets shape contemporary coverage.
The debate over the journalistic integrity and relevance of blogs has too often relied on “marshalling anecdotes” and has lacked quantitative evidence, said Ethan R. Zuckerman, a Berkman Fellow who was one of the developers of the site.
Defenders of blogs consider them vital agenda setters and reporters, citing instances where blogs have carried important stories neglected by mainstream media. 
For example, in 2007 the political blog Talking Points Memo played an instrumental role in unveiling the Bush administration’s politically motivated firing of US attorneys.
But critics dismiss serious journalistic contributions by blogs as being unrepresentative of the blogosphere as a whole, and tend to characterize blogs as forums often tainted by ideological biases.
Media Cloud will allow researchers to test some of those hypotheses, Zuckerman said. Past efforts to study online news dissemination have focused on analyzing how Web sites link to one another.
“Who has the power to set the agenda? Where do ideas come from? It’s an empirical question with enormous implications for political theory and how we see the relationship between the net and democracy,” said Yochai Benkler, a Law School professor and one of the chief architects of the Web site.
Media Cloud plans to make much of its data available to the public and to release the code that runs the content database so that the Web site can serve as a research platform for scholars studying the subject matter, said Hal M. Roberts, the technical architect of the Web site and self-identified “geek in residence” at the Berkman Center.
Benkler, who is also the Center’s faculty co-director, said he plans to utilize the database to examine the public debate over the recent economic stimulus package and how online media sources helped shape the final package that emerged from Congress.
“It’s like looking through a new telescope and seeing things that your prior tools couldn’t show you,” said Benkler.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Medical School professor accused of plagiarizing a review of rheumatoid arthritis treatments turned in his resignation last week, over a year after the alleged infraction.The allegedly offending professor, Lee S. Simon, had his article in the biomedical journal “Best Practices & Research: Clinical Rheumatology” retracted last year.The retraction came after a data-comparison search engine found that about half the text of the article was taken verbatim from a paper published in 2003.Though he had not spoken directly with Simon about the matter, Simon M. Helfgott, a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said that he believed Simon had intimated to others that the paper had been written by a third party before he himself signed off on it. “Unfortunately for him, that is not a defense that is acceptable,” Helfgott said.  Helfgott added that Harvard needs to set an example and has no choice but to discipline these cases.Several sources including Helfgott said that at the time of the alleged incident, Simon was only peripherally involved with the University, though he maintained his title at the Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.According to Helfgott, Simon has not seen patients at Beth Israel for over a decade. Beth Israel spokesperson Jerry Berger confirmed that Simon had not practiced at the hospital for over a year.“His involvement has been very minimal, virtually non-existent,” Helfgott said.  “He was able to keep his title going, but obviously that is not the case any more.”  Roy M. Fleischmann, the author of the allegedly plagiarized study, said that he had not heard that Simon had resigned. He said that no one from Harvard has contacted him in the past year.  Fleischmann said that as an author of an article that was apparently duplicated, his only expectation was that the plagiarized article was retracted.  “It is up to the University and Medical Center whether to take other actions,” he said. “It is not up to me. I get justice when it is retracted.”George C. Tsokos, who heads the rheumatology department at Beth Israel said that he has not interacted with Simon in over a year.“I know Harvard was doing an investigation and I was not privy to that at all,” Tsokos said. He added that no members of his division have been consulted by the reviewing committee.  “The last two years he was not associated with the division in any way,” Tsokos said. “He is not on my payroll, let’s put it that way.”Harold “Skip” R. Garner, Jr., who designed the search engine eTBLAST, which helped spot the duplication in Simon’s article last year, said in an e-mailed statement that it was “regrettable” that Simon would not longer be at Harvard.”Garner added that he did not understand the circumstances behind Simon’s resignation. “I don’t know what role our study, which identified similarity between his manuscript and a previous one by Dr. Roy Fleischmann played in his decision to resign,” Garner wrote.—Staff writer Laura G.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University has begun consulting with biology professors set to be displaced from their laboratories, marking top administrators’ first major attempt to consult affected faculty since the move was conceived.  
On Monday, three professors in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology met with outside architects and FAS physical resources officials to discuss the renovations of the displaced professors’ future laboratories in the Northwest Science Building.
MCB professor Guido Guidotti said it was confirmed at the meeting that he and fellow biology researchers Nancy Kleckner and Matthew Meselson will move down the street into the first floor of Northwest. All three biology professors currently occupy the Sherman-Fairchild Building.
Details on the move have come slowly since the University, shifting its plans in response to a financial downturn, first announced that several MCB professors would be relocated to make room for stem cell researchers previously bound for Harvard’s expanded campus in Allston.
Payette Associates—a local architectural firm that also helped design the now-delayed Allston Science Complex—surveyed the current laboratory spaces in Fairchild to study how future rooms in Northwest can be tailored to the MCB professors’ specific research needs, Guidotti said.
“Every space is different, so everybody needs to see how to translate where they are now to the next space,” Guidotti said. “That’s why the architects were there: to try and make a representation of what might be [in Northwest].”
Northwest was built as a combination of fully finished spaces and “shell” spaces, or rooms that can be adapted to meet the needs of specific faculty members, said Linda Snyder, associate executive dean of physical resources and planning. But she emphasized that spaces in Northwest allocated for biology professors will be completely finished and ready for use before laboratory staff and faculty move in.
The three displaced professors will move into a space that is currently “a large open unfinished space that resembles an empty warehouse,” one MCB professor wrote in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
“As I understand it, the architect thinks the space has significant deficiencies but perhaps it will turn out OK,” wrote the individual, who asked to not be named in order to preserve his relationship with the University. “This does however seem a harsh way to treat three members of the National Academy.”
Snyder, the physical resources dean, said the administration has been working “very closely” with all of the affected faculty on the development of their new laboratories. But the remark contrasts starkly with what many biology professors have called an exclusion from discussions about a move that directly affects them and their research.
For many MCB professors, all news about the departure prior to Monday’s meeting had been relayed by from University administrators via Department Chair Catherine Dulac, allowing no faculty dialogue during the decision-making stages.
Snyder said the time frame for the departure of MCB professors from Fairchild and their move into Northwest, as well as the necessary renovations, remains uncertain.
Other Fairchild MCB professors could not be reached for comment. Guidotti said some of them may move into the Biological Laboratories due to space constraints in Northwest.
Jeff DeGregorio, who is managing the project at Payette, said he had been asked by Harvard to decline comment regarding the renovations.

The Harvard University Police Department and campus minority groups hosted an informal dialogue about race relations and law enforcement in Quincy Junior Common Room last night.
The event, which came on the heels of a two-year period in which relationships between minority students and HUPD officers have been occasionally strained, was aimed at increasing minority students’ comfort with their campus police, according to Jarell L. Lee ’10, who has been working to organize the event since last May.   
HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley and more than 25 officers participated in the open discussion, which was presented by student representatives from the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, the Black Men’s Forum, the Latino Men’s Collective, the South Asian Men’s Collective, and the Asian American Brotherhood.
The event was not without context. In May 2007, a debate over racism ensued after HUPD responded to calls about an event organized by black student groups in the Quad. Cabot House residents sent a thread of e-mails questioning the presence of the student groups on the public lawn. 
After an incident last August in which HUPD officers on campus confronted a black high school student trying to remove a bike lock from his own bicycle, University President Drew G. Faust announced the creation of a six-member committee to review HUPD’s practices.   
Lee said that the Quad incident was one of the factors that set him thinking about ways to improve levels of understanding between minorities and police on campus. 
“When the Quad incident happened, I didn’t believe HUPD racially profiled us because I knew many of the officers personally and knew they do not do that,” he said. “But I understand a lot of students didn’t know the officers as well.”
Many students last night recounted experiences of what they considered racial profiling at the hands of campus police officers.
Still, these students added that often the fault did not lie entirely with the officers themselves. Instead, they said some of the incidents were sparked by student calls and individual reports to HUPD. 
According to a statement by HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano after yesterday’s event, the department now has a new diversity and community outreach coordinator. The coordinator will work with the leaders of seven HUPD teams who already interact closely with students, HoCo chairs, and tutors.
“Every interaction that an officer has with a student is community relations. We demand professionalism and our officers act professionally,” Catalano said. 
“Every positive interaction they have helps moves our community policing philosophy forward,” he added.

Harvard Hillel’s leaders quelled student concerns about a lack of rabbinic presence on campus last night at their second Coordinating Council meeting of the semester. The meeting, designated “Priorities of the Community,” was an open discussion in which Hillel members voiced their concerns regarding their organization’s response to the current financial downturn.Last night’s meeting was inspired in part by an e-mail sent by Hillel member Peter N. Ganong ’09 over the Hillel undergraduate mailing list in late February. “Hillel is in a budget crisis,” wrote Ganong in the e-mail. Ganong also stated that Hillel leaders had expressed the possibility of not having any rabbis next year due to the poor economic climate.The question of a continued rabbinical presence on campus was the first issue brought up in the discussion. Religious life is “a very important part of my Hillel experience,” said Avishai D. Don ’12. “I don’t know how exactly the minyanim [set of Jewish prayer groups] is going to be affected by the financial crisis.”Hillel Associate Director Michael Simon assured students during the meeting that there would definitely be a continued rabbinical presence in the Hillel community. “There will be rabbis on staff [next year], and at least one who primarily serves undergraduate students,” he said. Students also raised the issue of community building. “It is important that people who come to pray and eat at Hillel have a community that they feel comfortable and excited about joining,” said Hillel undergraduate president Rebecca D. Gillette ’10 after the event.Gillette added that there was a desire among Hillel students and staff to hear student feedback on spending priorities. “We and every other organization are sitting in the middle of a difficult situation,” Gillette said. “We’re being very careful with money. Students leaders are sitting down with staff to prioritize and get creative with our programming.”Official decisions about Hillel’s budget, which is proposed by student leaders and staff and later approved by an executive board,  will not be made until later in the spring. Hillel student leader Michael B. Pershan ’10 said that Ganong’s email was the result of a misunderstanding. Pershan said he believed Hillel is financially stable. “The rate of programming is exactly the same; we’re going to have rabbis next year,” he said. “Nothing really has changed.”“We’re not in a financial crisis,” Gillette said. “It was more of an opportunity for students to engage more in conversations of priorities, and how students could get involved.”—Melody Y.

Former Crimson editorial columnist and Harvard Salient editor Ross G. Douthat ’02 will become a weekly Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times beginning in mid-April, replacing conservative writer William Kristol ’73.Douthat—a senior editor at The Atlantic who has already authored two books—will become the Times’ youngest columnist, writing online and blogging before appearing in print opposite liberal Paul Krugman.“We were looking for a conservative writer,” said New York Times editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal. “He has a fresh perspective, and writes from a  clear philosophical and ideological point of view. He can be critical of Republican policies.”Atlantic Associate Editor and former Crimson Managing Editor Marc J. Ambinder ’01 met Douthat through The Crimson, where, Douthat “established himself as the premier conservative voice on campus,” said Ambinder. The two continued to work together at The Atlantic.“If you look at his writing at Harvard, you see an extremely sharp intellectual mind,” he said. “Some of his writings were orthodox, others were heterodox...he was vacillating between the two, trying to figure out who he was as a writer and thinker.”“He was very much in the mode of a commentator and a chronicler of the liberal foibles of Harvard. There was always a depth that other polemicists did not have,” Ambinder added. Douthat’s freshman year roommate Jason T. Sauer ’02 said he was unsurprised by Douthat’s appointment based on his recollections of his former roommate’s record as a journalist in College.  One piece profiling Douthat as a senior in Fifteen Minutes magazine cited him for writing over 3000 words of copy each week “I think that in a lot of ways, this new position is going to be a continuation of the role that Ross found for himself on the Harvard campus,” he said. “He made the back page of the Harvard Salient a must-read for three years.” Douthat isn’t just a fill-in for Kristol’s specific conservative voice, Ambinder said. “It’s safe [for the Times] to choose a Bill Kristol because he won’t persuade people to see his point of view,” he said. “Ross isn’t like that. Ross is going to persuade people.”  “The New York Times is giving an immensely talented writer and thinker a megaphone to use to reshape the conservative movement in this country,” Ambinder added.Douthat declined to comment, saying that his blogpost about his new position—in which he thanked The Times “for taking an awfully big chance”—would be his only statement on the matter.

Cupcake fanatics will get their fill of ‘Sweet’ when the aptly named cupcake vendor hits Harvard Square this spring. Sweet currently has a branch in Boston’s Back Bay and is slated to open in the Brattle Street storefront between Tealuxe and Curious George Books and Toys—a site formerly occupied by Cross, the high-end pen store. The store’s launch date has not been set, but owner Courtney M. Forrester said she hopes to be serving her fresh-baked daily goods by early May.Forrester first opened the Boston branch of Sweet in May 2008.“I kind of got on a cupcake kick,” she said of her restaurant’s beginning. “I noticed, as I was experimenting with my own recipes, that there weren’t a lot of places in Boston to purchase things that were fresh-made.”Cupcakes have enjoyed an upsurge in popularity in recent years, with stores like New York City’s Magnolia Bakery drawing credit for sparking the craze over the portable confections. The trend has also caught on in other major cities, like Los Angeles.Closer to home, Kickass Cupcakes in Somerville’s Davis Square opened in 2007, and many Boston bakeries offer gourmet twists on the childhood favorite.Forrester said that while her product was influenced by Magnolia, Sweet takes a different tack.“Magnolia has a little bit more of a home-baked feel,” she said. “Our cakes are more stylized.”Sweet’s daily menu will include the requisite chocolate and vanilla cupcakes along with seasonal and specialty flavors. Forrester said that the cupcakes are baked fresh daily without stabilizers and preservatives. Vegan-friendly options will be available on Mondays and Tuesdays.Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she had already sampled Sweet’s offerings.“I think I’m going to need a treadmill,” she said, laughing.She said that opening up the original Sweet in the middle of an economic downturn has not been a problem.“We’ve had a really warm welcome from the Boston community and a really good business level,” she said.Cross—the original occupant of the space that the new cupcake shop will fill—has decided to focus its enterprise on its mall locations.“[Cross] never really worked in that location,” said Jillson. Andre N. Davies ’11, a self-proclaimed cupcake connoisseur, has already scoped out Sweet’s competition. In an interview yesterday, he discussed offerings at Kickass Cupcakes, the Harvard dining halls, and Au Bon Pain.“I’m very excited,” he said of Sweet’s opening. “I like extra, extra icing.”As for Forrester’s favorite, it’s a tie.“The vanilla is closest to my heart,” he said, but not before adding, “Our red velvet is really yummy.”—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

Several subcontracted custodial workers employed by Harvard Real Estate Services have been abruptly notified that they will be laid off effective Monday and others have been informed that their hours will be reduced, according to a union organizer.OneSource and UNICCO—subcontracted companies that clean properties administered by HRES—had been asked by Harvard earlier this year to cut contract costs in response to a predicted 30 percent decline in the University’s endowment. Two weeks ago, HRES told OneSource more specifically that it must cut 40 percent of its costs by March 16, according to Daniel B. Becker, an organizer for Service Employees International Union Local 615, which represents custodial workers at Harvard.Manny Costa, who manages OneSource’s contract with Harvard, said that it had not yet been decided which workers nor how many workers would be laid off—even though the timing potentially gives some weekend workers less than a day’s notice before their termination. He added that the information would likely be finalized by tomorrow, but he refused to provide estimates regarding the number of workers to be cut.Becker said that to the best of his knowledge, eight workers would be laid off and two would face reduced hours out of the total 19 workers subcontracted by HRES from OneSource and UNICCO. He noted that while the remainder will not see their hours changed, they will have substantially more ground to cover in their work.Becker added yesterday that all figures had not been finalized and could change.Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin said that the scaling back of contracts was necessary in response to the University’s unprecedented fiscal challenges. The move “comes after we have frozen salaries for faculty and non-union staff this year and offered a voluntary early retirement program in order to lower compensation costs,” he said.Additional confusion has arisen after various custodial workers reported that they had been notified of their termination—even though they were not on preliminary lists of workers to be cut provided by the subcontractors, Becker said. But he added that the Union has procedures established to address potential mistakes—including compensation and reinstatement—and that the more distressing issue is that layoffs are occurring at all. He noted that Harvard Medical School is also planning similar moves to cut costs through subcontractors, and that the Union is certain that further waves of cuts are to follow.“We know the layoffs will have a devastating impact for families,” Becker said. “We have, amongst those set to be laid off, one worker who has a young child in El Salvador, who he provides [funding] for her schooling and medical necessities.” Becker said that notifying workers of layoffs and hours-reductions on such short notice is not illegal or a breach of contract, but does “break a whole host of moral values.”“The fact that a worker can be notified with less than one day’s notice...is part of a systemic problem that is at its core [representative of] the very limited legal protections” enjoyed by American workers today, Becker said. —Staff Writer Peter F.

For almost 90 years, Central Barber Shop has been located at 1611 Massachusetts Avenue—commonly referred to as The Bence Building—in Agassiz, but now Harvard is forcing it to relocate, citing environmental concerns.In 2007, Harvard discovered that there were dry-cleaning solvents emanating from Crimson Cleaners, another business in the Bence complex, according to Mary Power, senior director of community communications at Harvard.  The results of extensive studies by the University showed that the solvents had “significant” effects on the environment.In response, Harvard started to terminate its leases with various businesses in the building, most recently Three Aces Pizzeria.  Negotiations have now begun to end the lease of Central Barber Shop, currently the only store that remains in the Bence complex.  “Our clean-up activities can advance more quickly in a vacant building,” said Power. “When we initially started the studies we did not expect to find such widespread contamination.  The nature of the remediation is likely to be long-term and very complex.”While Power said it was her belief that the reasons for emptying the building were made clear to the tenants, Central Barber Shop’s Alfred Iannacone, or “Fred the Barber,” as he is known to customers, disagreed.“I don’t really know what’s going on,” he said. “They’re pressuring everyone out and I’m the only one left.”Iannacone, who has worked in the barber shop for 30 years, called the treatment he has received from Harvard “very cold.” He said that he has been told to leave by January 2010, two years before the termination of his five-year lease. While business has not been suffering too much from the financial crisis, a move could affect it drastically, he added.“Right now, with the financial times not too good, you don’t want to go into the hole.”“It [the shop] is my livelihood,” he said. “It’s my business. I brought up a family doing this.”William W. Bloomstein, an Agassiz resident since 1994, said that there had been an implicit agreement between Harvard and the community that “the Bence Building was going to be protected for a long time.”But Bloomstein added that he did not “see this as Harvard reneging on a promise,” as it was necessary to vacate the building for environmental reasons.“Am I happy that the Bence Building is basically vacated? No. This is not a good thing for Mass Ave., or the community, but the goal is that Harvard will bring retail back there,” he said.  “I’m going to take Harvard on its word.”-Staff writer Sofia E.

Former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao discussed possible career options with students last night at the Institute of Politics. The event was part of the IOP Internships Program’s effort to allow students to speak to people with careers in politics and public service. The Office of Career Services co-sponsored the event.“I don’t see a lot of immigrants in the public service sector,” said Y. John Mei ’12, pointing to the similarities between his own background and Chao’s. “Therefore, it is particularly refreshing to see someone like her.”Chao, a graduate of Harvard Business School, has gone from being a banker to serving as Director of the Peace Corps to becoming President of the nonprofit organization United Way over the course of her career. Her last position was as President George W. Bush’s Secretary of Labor.When asked about acquiring jobs in the midst of an economic downturn, Chao encouraged students to look more closely at public sector positions, predicting that the federal government would likely undergo a massive retirement wave in the next five to 10 years, leading to a higher demand for skilled professionals in that area.“Especially now with the recent stimulus package, there will be a period of tremendous governmental spending,” she said.“And they are going to need more people to watch over new programs to be established,” Chao added.Retirement and health-care packages for public sector jobs were “gold-plated,” Chao said, although starting salaries may not be as high as in the private sector.  “I really enjoyed the event, as Ms. Chao pretended that we were all looking for a job,” Mei said.He added that the former Cabinet member, “gave us sincere and specific advice on how to approach people, manage our connections, look for jobs, and finally land one.”Chao, who is serving as an IOP Visiting Fellow this spring, said she plans to continue work in the public sector following her stint at the Institute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tonight, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team will face Hartford (0-3) as it attempts to bounce back from a disappointing loss last weekend when the Crimson dropped a 7-3 contest to then-No. 19/17 Massachusetts. 
“After a tough loss—and one that we only have ourselves to blame for—we’re all hungry to get out and get after somebody,” co-captain Sam Slaughter wrote in an e-mail.
No. 16/15 Harvard (2-1) looks to earn its first win at home this season after starting out 2-0 on the road, including a shocking win over then-No. 7/5 Duke. 
The season-opening upset marked Crimson coach John Tillman’s first victory over a top-10 opponent since taking over the program last year.
In their last meeting, Harvard coasted to an 11-2 victory against the Hawks. 
Junior midfielder Jason Duboe led the Crimson with three goals in the game and sophomore attacker Dean Gibbons recorded a goal and two assists.
Harvard enters the match-up looking to play the kind of game it did against the Blue Devils and avoid the mistakes that cost the squad last week versus the Minutemen.
“We want to get back to simple things and fundamentals,” said Tillman. “We have gone back to the basics.”
Thus far in 2009, Hartford has suffered a pair of overtime defeats. 
Last week’s thriller against Sacred Heart featured a game-winning goal in the opening seconds of overtime, and in the season opener, the Hawks fell to Dartmouth in the final seconds of sudden-death.
“We are young, so, despite losses, guys are still positive and excited about…[the] season,” Hartford coach Peter Lawrence wrote in an email.  “[I am] very impressed with Harvard so far this season…They play very hard, are disciplined, great on [ground balls], and have a bunch of great players.”
Even though the Hawks are still searching for their first win, the Crimson cannot afford to take them lightly.
“We only play 12 games. Each one is really important,” Tillman said. “Anyone can beat anyone on any given day, and if we don’t come ready, we are leaving our team vulnerable.”
The lingering question for Harvard is whether it can recover from last week’s poor offensive performance. Against UMass, the Crimson was able to convert only three of its 39 shots for goals.
“We tried to make plays that weren’t really there,” said Tillman. “We want to take the best shot available, not the first shot available.”
Despite the lack of offense against the Minutemen, Gibbons has provided a spark to the attack thus far. After missing the opener, Gibbons has scored six goals in two games. 
Duboe, an All-Ivy First Team selection last season, also looks to add to the offense. The junior has scored in each of the first two games. 
Not only must Harvard improve its offense from last week, the defense must also recover after letting up a season-high seven goals.
“We have a lot of confidence in our defensive personnel,” said Tillman. “There’s a lot of experience, leadership, and talent down there.”
Behind the defense, senior goalie Joe Pike has been a key to the Crimson’s success. Tonight, he hopes to match his 10-save performance against Hartford last season. 
Against Duke, he stopped an impressive nine shots, followed by a six save game against Stony Brook. 
Last week, however, he could only block three attempts while giving up seven goals to the Minutemen. 
“We asked [Pike] to bring a little more energy to the table this year,” said Tillman. “If he can do that, our guys around him will pick up and feed off of that.”
A convincing win in this game will help Harvard build momentum leading up to its first Ivy-league match-up of the year against Penn and then its upcoming games against ranked opponents Georgetown and Cornell. 
On the other hand, a loss to Hartford may lead critics to believe the upset in Durham was a fluke. 
“Nobody in our locker room is thinking past Friday,” Slaughter wrote. “We want to get a win and wash out the taste of last weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This season marked the 20th anniversary of the Harvard men’s hockey team’s last NCAA title. 
To celebrate the occasion, the 1989 championship team—which included tournament MVP and current head coach Ted Donato ’91—reunited at the Bright Hockey Center.
But the very same night that the NCAA team was honored, Harvard suffered a 6-2 loss to Yale, yet another humiliation in the midst of a 13-game winless streak.
The contrast was all too apparent.
And now, when all is said and done, the Crimson will not be a part of the NCAA tournament pool for the third consecutive year.
It almost comes as a shock. 
After all, Harvard had a Cinderella season and looked like a dark horse candidate for the ECAC title. 
Although the Crimson seemed doomed after a double-digit slump through the winter months, the squad nearly upset No. 1 Boston University and then-No. 15 Boston College in the Beanpot tournament, pushing each rival to the brink until giving up a one-point game in the final minutes. 
After that, Harvard made a huge comeback, picking off league-leaders such as No. 6 Princeton and second-place Cornell on its way to a six-game unbeaten streak.
But the Crimson’s dramatic comeback was cut short last weekend when it yielded two losses to bottom-feeder Brown in the first round of the ECAC tournament. 
Instead of making headlines as the comeback kids, the Crimson made the kind of history no team ever wants to make. Giving up back-to-back shutouts against an American collegiate team for the first time ever is hardly the way the 2009 squad would like to be remembered.
So what happened that caused the Crimson to choke in the ECAC tournament?
Unfortunately, this storyline has become all too familiar. 
Last season unraveled in an uncannily similar way. After showing some initial promise, Harvard spiraled into a 10-game losing streak that was finally snapped with a 3-1 win over Dartmouth. 
A few games later, the Crimson advanced to the championship round of the Beanpot for the first time in a decade and pressed eventual NCAA champion Boston College to overtime before surrendering a 6-5 loss. 
From then on, Harvard continued on a hot streak that carried it to the ECAC championship game. 
But once again, the Crimson choked, falling in a 4-1 loss against Princeton.
And the season before that, as I entered into the tradition of Harvard hockey reporting, I watched the Crimson fight its way to the quarterfinals, dazzling me as I gained my education in Harvard hockey. 
But yet again, the squad gave it all up in the ECAC tournament, handing victory to Clarkson.
Back then, the turn of events in the ECAC tournament still came as a surprise for the 06-07 seniors, who had had two ECAC championship titles and three NCAA tournament appearances under their belts.
But now, as this year’s seniors—the last class who has advanced to the NCAA series—approaches commencement, the Crimson’s failure in the ECAC run-off is nothing new, and is perhaps even expected.
What happened to the fabled Harvard hockey teams of old? The teams who danced across the ice to secure eight ECAC championship titles, 13 ECAC regular-season championships and 21 NCAA championship appearances? Is this all that’s left of the legacy that had inspired me to cover ice hockey in the first place?
I’m not sure if I have the answers to those questions. But I hope Donato finds them fast.
The class of 2010 has one more season to make the NCAAs. If the Crimson fails to reach the tournament then, the rising seniors will be the first class to graduate without an NCAA appearance in 12 years. 
That means assistant captain Alex Biega, who not only anchors Harvard’s defensive line but also leads the Crimson in assists, and junior Doug Rogers, who is the Crimson’s offensive powerhouse with eight goals and has the leading faceoffs average on the current roster, will have never seen time in the NCAAs. Biega and Rogers—the two players who lead the Crimson in points both this season and in career stats—have a combined 137 points with one more season to go. Maybe it’s just me, but those stats seem to merit tournament time. 
For some reason, they have yet to hit the big payoff. 
But there’s still another chance.
We’ve got one year left, boys.
Let’s make it count.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While over 300 students watched the action film Watchmen as part of CEB’s Dinner and a Movie, a few dozen spectators sat at the edge of their seats to see the finish of the Harvard women’s tennis match. Not only was there action at the Murr Center, but drama too.
With 11 days to prepare for its match against No. 68 Boston College (5-5), the Crimson players came out well-rested and ready for their competition. Harvard (3-5) defeated its first ranked opponent this season by a score of 4-3.
Drama gripped the gallery, as the doubles matches were all highly competitive battles. 
Sophomore Agnes Sibilski and senior Beier Ko carried their match 8-6.  With the score tied 5-5 and the Crimson leading 40-30, a key play came when Ko broke BC’s serve with a volley down the center of the court, splitting the Eagles pair. 
In the final game, at deuce, Ko zinged her serve down that same path for an ace, allowing Harvard to win the match on the next point.
At. No. 1, sophomore Samantha Rosekrans and captain Laura Peterzan came from behind to pull out a 9-7 win. 
Facing a deficit of 7-5, the pair took the momentum with a giant overhead smash by Rosekrans that landed in the gallery. Later in the game, she once again showed her skills at the net, angling a ball at the feet of her BC counterpart for the win. 
Leading 8-7, Peterzan clinched the doubles point when she ripped a forehand that the Eagles just couldn’t handle.
At No. 3, freshmen Camille Jania and Caroline Davis played together for the first time this spring. Taking some time to acclimate to each other, the pair went down 6-0. 
The first-years then battled back to make it 7-6 before BC held its serve and took the win.
With the doubles point under its belt, Harvard went into the singles matches with the slight advantage.
Peterzan followed her strong doubles performance with a just-as-impressive singles match showing. Leading 6-5, she broke her opponent’s serve to take the first set. She clinched the second set 6-3 with a strong cross-court forehand.
Rosekrans and freshman Louise Laciny each lost in straight sets to the Eagles, making the score 2-2 with three matches going into a third set to decide the overall contest.
Ko won her first set, but controversy ensued in the second set tiebreak when BC’s Lana Krasnopolsky called Ko’s shot wide and the official refused to overrule the call. Krasnopolsky went on to win the match 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
With the Crimson down 2-3, pressure rested on the Jania and Sibilski, who mirrored each other’s play on the adjacent No. 4 and No. 5 courts.
Jania followed up a strong 6-3 first set with a 6-4 loss in the second. In the final set she converted a break point to make the set 5-5. She prevailed in the next game after almost blowing a 40-0 lead. 
“My heart was clenched,” Jania said.
Leading the final game of the match 40-30, Jania could not convert her first match point and the game went to deuce. At that point, Jania forced a break opportunity and then softly angled her overhead put-away across the court to claim the victory.
Sibilski took a similar path to triumph. Taking the first set 6-3 and losing the next 6-1, she likewise broke her opponent to make the set 5-5 in a back-and-forth game that featured two match points for the Eagles. 
“When you’re down to match point, then you either win or you lose,” Sibilski said. “So I said I might as well just finish on my terms.”
Sibilski barely held her serve in the next game, in which each player had a game point. 
“It’s weird how in college tennis one point changes the entire match,” Sibilski said. “Every point counts.”
At the time, Jania won her match to push the overall score to 3-3. Sibilski led her final game by a smidgen, 30-15.
“There was enormous pressure,” Sibilski said.
With her teammates cheering her on, Sibilski took the next point but could not put BC away with her first match point. The dramatic match ended surprisingly when the Eagles double-faulted to give Harvard the set, the No 5. match, and the overall contest.
“It shows that if we really believe and pull together, we can still be great,” Peterzan said.

Howdy folks, here's your weekend roundup of all things arts. You'll be so cultured, you'll be like yogurt.
On Campus:
Saturday is sold out, but Friday you can still catch one of the last performances of the Lowell Opera Society's "Otello." (8:30 p.m.; Students $12, through Harvard Box Office)
The Harvard Collegium-Musicum performs 20th century classical choral scores "Frank Martin's Mass" and "Songs of Love and War" on Friday night (8 p.m.; Sanders Theatre; Students $10, through the Harvard Box Office or online).
Agnes Varda is a French film director, and she and her films are gracing the Harvard Film Archive until the 16th.

(See website for showtimes; free for Harvard students).
Catch the off-campus buzz after the jump... It's worth it if only for the picture.
And Off:
It's Saint Patty's Day weekend. For Boston in all its beer-soaked glory, there's nowhere like the Southie parade on Sunday. It starts at 1 pm from the Broadway T-stop on the Red Line. Every Irish pub in town is trying to prove its about more than green beer, and the Globe has a round-up of places offering special Irish menus.
Chances are you won't be able to get any tickets to the Dropkick Murphy's annual March homecoming bash. But just in case-- they'll be at House of Blues all week. (6 p.m.; $29.50 through Ticketmaster.com)
For a less raucous outing, an exhibit of Venetian Renaissance maestros Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese opens Sunday at the Museum of Fine Arts. Quite the smorgasbord, with almost 20 paintings by each. (MFA is open 10 a.m.-4:45 p.m. Sa-Tu, 10 a.m.-9:45 p.m. W-F; $15 with student ID, free Weds. after 4).
Now that Obama's transformed America into a post-racial rainbow land, what will protest punk rockers Propaghandi have to rage about? I have a hunch they'll find something. (Middle East Downstairs; Sunday, 7pm; $17 at the door)
Speaking of propaganda, the Brattle is showing "Selling Democracy: Films of the Marshall Plan." These were pieces made for distribution in Europe, and most of the five flicks have never been seen in the U.S. before. Also, for a joint Friday the 13th/St. Paddy's Day celebration, on Friday night at 10 p.m. they'll be playing the "horror" film "Leprechaun," in which a wee green man terrorizes Jennifer Aniston. (Marshall Plan films run March 12-19; for showtimes see website)

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
It takes a real warrior to VOID on a Thursday.  Beaten and bruised from the week that was, there's an incredible temptation to just pack it in and slip into weekend mode--especially when you know those Phoenix kids are out partying it up without you (And in case any of these guys are out VOIDing tonight, here's some inspiration for your exploits).
But let's not spend too much time rejoicing for being here, as a Thursday VOID begs to be forward-looking.  You know what this weekend is about: spend some time brushing up on your St. Patty's history--its worth picking up a few random facts for conversation sake.  Then move straight to getting in the mood.  Oops...sorry about that last one, FlyBy just couldn't resist the temptation.  One last note: St. Patty's is actually Tuesday, the 17th, so if someone tries to pinch you this weekend, consider it a rare opportunity to dish out an old-school Indian rug burn.

Even though the weather may not show it yet, spring is definitely in the air for Harvard athletics this weekend. With the major winter draws of hockey and men's basketball over, it's time to turn our attention to baseball, tennis, and lacrosse. More on a sports-filled weekend after the jump!
For you Crimson Crazies, the only home game this weekend comes tonight, as the No. 16 men's lacrosse team hosts Hartford at 6:00 p.m. on Cumnock Turf. After kicking off the season with a road upset of Duke, Harvard took down nationally-ranked Stony Brook before coming up short against No. 13 UMass at home last weekend. Come watch junior goalie Joe Pike, who has the nation's third-best goals-against average, top scorers Jeffrey A. Cohen '12 and Dean W. Gibbons, and the rest of the laxers in their final tuneup before the start of Ivy competition.
Many of the Crimson athletes will be seeking warmer weather this weekend, with baseball and both tennis teams headed south of the Mason-Dixon line. Women's lacrosse opens its Ivy slate at Brown tomorrow afternoon, and men's volleyball is out seeking its first road win.
But keep an eye out for a couple of performances on the national scene: sophomore diver Zac Ranta will compete at the NCAA Zone A Diving Championships, where he hopes to earn a berth to NCAAs at the end of the month, and senior Becky Christensen is one of 17 high jumpers in the field at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships tonight in Texas.

As Housing Day approaches, FlyBy will serve as your personal rating agency with a complete rundown by a resident of each House. Not that you have any say (River Gods notwithstanding), but at least you'll know whether your portfolio is getting a downgrade.
Should you go to bed Wednesday night praying for residence in Lino's Eliot Inferno? Get a complete analysis after the jump.
Rooming: Middle of the road for a River House, but definitely better than its next door neighbor. Request the 5th floor your sophomore year and you'll coast through with moderately sized (walk-thru) singles for three years, though don't expect to be overwhelmed by large common rooms.  That said, this House boasts excellent senior party suites. If you game the system right your group will get the Cockpit or Ground Zero senior year, otherwise you've failed to grasp the intricacies of Eliot's arcane housing lottery.
Dining Hall: Dimly lit and sometimes pantless. It's not as swamped as dining halls closer to the Yard. Breakfast is often dominated by jocks, but who gets up for that anyway? Brain break is consistently disappointing, with the same monotonous spread of peanut butter, bread, and cereal every. single. night.  And even these spartan offerings are limited by an obnoxious policy of locking down brain break between midnight and 2 a.m. Not that there'd be any food left by then, but it'd be nice to be able to get a fucking soda after you've actually started to make progress on your pset.
House List: Lots of event-based spam hits the Eliot list, but it's worth keeping yourself subscribed for the occasional entertaining YouTube post or random argument.  
 House Masters: Definitely an asset for Eliot. Dante scholar Lino Pertile makes a point of memorizing every resident's name and can often be seen chatting up students in the dining hall. He routinely downs a beer or two with students at Eliot's weekly Stein Club and is famous for hilarious rants about all things boating at formal dinners.
House Culture: This House is all about the Fete, and Eliot's strict resident + one policy sends the House List into a frenzy looking for extra tickets every April. That said, it quite doesn't live up to the hype, though perhaps no House formal could. Throughout the year, Eliot takes its weekly Stein Clubs almost as seriously as its Boat Club, whose members, including Lino, flood the dining hall every morning after spring break.  You might think a House blog would be a selling point, but the recently launched El-Word is heavily dominated by Ho-Co and its content can be insular.  Finally, while the new Inferno is no Quincy Grille, it does make up for weak Brain Breaks. We're still waiting for a Gchat ordering option.
The Rating: A.* Overall, you'd be pretty lucky to wake up to shouts of "Domus" next Thursday morning. The somewhat quirky House traditions like Fete and Boat Club end up being real selling points. And with Lino watching over this House, you can be sure you'll never end up sleeping with the fishes.
*Ratings run as such: [AAA > AA > A > BBB > junk > subprime]

As Housing Day approaches, FlyBy will serve as your personal rating agency with a complete rundown by a resident of each House. Not that you have any say (River Gods notwithstanding), but at least you’ll know whether your portfolio is getting a downgrade. 
It's not as if FlyBy needs to convince you that you want to live in Adams House next year. We just want to remind you that a House doesn't automatically become the best just because you get placed in it. We’ve got an asset by asset breakdown of this coveted house after the jump.
Rooming: Ideal. It’s all about location, location, location, and Adams is prime real estate. Whether you live in A entryway or on the fifth floor of Claverly (overflow Adams/Lowell housing), any room in Adams is significantly closer to everything. The fifteen extra minutes of sleep you get because you can leave for class at 10:00 a.m. rather than 9:45 like your Mather friends will be more valuable than gold. As if that wasn’t enough, do the words “Gold Coast” mean anything to you? They imply that your room will have wood molding, a wood fireplace, and actually feel like a charming, historic Harvard dorm rather than a concrete box.
Now, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Your room is going to be old. You might even see some cockroaches. And if you live in Claverly, there aren’t underground tunnels to allow a leisurly pajama-clad walk to the d-hall.
But, you’ll never need to touch a shuttle schedule, much less walk down Cowperwaithe Street. And just think about all that extra sleep.
Dining Hall: Popular. Everyone wants to eat in Adams. That’s the problem. Adams residents are notoriously bitter about the overcrowding of Adams dining hall. Lucy’s much too nice to turn people away (unless she has Vinnie M. Chiappini's help), so the dining hall is frequently packed with non-Adams residents, making it nearly impossible to find a seat during peak hours. And once you do, good luck maneuvering your huge, awkward wooden chair.
But the dining hall isn’t entirely bad. Dining hall manager Dave A. Seley would do anything to make Adams residents happy and ensure they enjoy their dining experiences (or ensure the return of a stolen CEB Turf trophy).
Oh, and be prepared to have your dinner interrupted by the gong.
House List: Active. Schmooze is certainly one of, if not the liveliest of all the house e-mail lists. If you post something to Schmooze (the pretentious name of the Adams e-mail list), someone is probably going to respond. If you need fishnets and superglue, someone will offer them to you within minutes of your Schmooze request. And Adams residents always have something to say about a topic. See the great wrap/sandwich debate of 2009.
House Masters: Excellent. The Palfreys are very welcoming and extremely involved in House life. Good luck catching Sean G. Palfrey without a smile on his face (well, maybe if the IM tennis team loses a match). And make sure not to miss out on the incredible Apthorp Teas.
House Culture: Eccentric. The days of nude swimming parties may be behind us, but Adams still has its quirks. The underground tunnels are adorned with both interesting and odd paintings. Break out your formal wear for the annual black tie reading of “Winnie the Pooh” at the Winter Feast. And don’t forget Drag Night. Even the Palfreys participate. Adams House is certainly filled with characters—but friendly, hilarious, Adams-loving characters.
The Rating: AAA. You know you’ve wanted to live in Adams since the second day of school, when all your friends told you it was the best house at Harvard. And you know that if you see the Adams delegation outside your door next Thursday morning, you'll be ecstatic (not to mention the envy of all your friends). Adams is the best house. Period.
