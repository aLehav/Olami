After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twelve Harvard faculty joined more than 300 American historians and legal scholars in signing an open letter calling for President Donald J. Trump to be impeached for the second time in his presidential term.
The letter comes as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have publicly demanded Trump’s removal from office following a deadly riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol building. The storming occurred after an inflammatory speech by Trump in which he repeated baseless claims that he won the presidential election.
Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced an article of impeachment on Monday, charging Trump with “incitement of insurrection.” The House is likely to vote to impeach on Wednesday.
The academics’ letter calls Trump a “clear and present danger to American democracy and the national security of the United States.”
“By fomenting violence against the Congress and seeking to subvert constitutional democracy, which resulted in the killing of a Capitol police officer and the deaths of several rioters, Trump has violated his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” it reads.
As of Monday evening, the 12 Harvard-affiliated signatories to the letter include faculty in History, History of Science, and African and African American Studies departments, the Law School, and the Kennedy School, in addition to University Professor Laurence H. Tribe and award-winning historian and journalist James Carroll, an associate at the Mahindra Humanities Center.
Carroll said in an interview that he signed the letter as soon as it was sent to him on Sunday.
“Trump simply must be held accountable for the crimes he committed last Wednesday in blatantly encouraging the savaging of the U.S. Capitol,” he said. “If that’s not criminal behavior by a president, I don’t know what is.”
History of Science Professor Elizabeth A. Lunbeck, who signed the letter, said impeachment would be a moment of long-delayed accountability for the president.
“He’s never been held to account in his entire life – he’s gotten away with metaphorically shooting people on Fifth Avenue,” she said. “If he gets away with this, we might as well do away with the option to impeach at all.”
Kennedy School professor Alexander Keyssar, another one of the letter’s signatories, said impeachment would send a forceful message, amounting to “a strong public sanction and something of a drawing of a line in the sand.”
“Saying, ‘you can’t go here,’ whether addressed to him or other presidents,” Keyssar added.
While some Republican lawmakers have argued against impeachment on the grounds that Democrats should seek “unity” rather than stoking a political fight, Kennedy School lecturer and letter signatory Richard J. Parker said he disagreed.
“At some point — whether we’re Democrats or Republicans or liberal or conservative — we have to reclaim the centrality of law and reason,” he said.
Trump became the third American president to be impeached in December 2019. If the House votes to impeach him again, which is likely to occur on Wednesday, Trump would become the first president to be impeached twice.
Even if impeachment does not remove Trump from office before the end of his term, Carroll said it would force the president to “think twice about what he does” for the remaining eight days of his term.
It would also act as a lasting rebuke and a mark on his legacy, Carroll added.
“Just to be impeached is a disgrace,” he said. “To be impeached twice – that will be the first thing said about Trump in his obituary.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid skyrocketing nationwide case counts of Covid-19, Harvard administrators announced Monday that the College is cautiously moving forward with welcoming increased numbers of students back to campus for the spring semester.
In December, Harvard College announced that it would expand on-campus living to prioritize seniors, juniors who were enrolled in fall 2020, and students with learning environment needs.
Writing to all University affiliates Monday morning, University President Lawrence S. Bacow cited “record high numbers of cases worldwide and in the United States” as cause for caution and increased flexibility for spring plans.
“Those plans depend on the status of the pandemic and may need to change if the situation continues to deteriorate,” Bacow wrote. “Each School has developed contingency plans and will be in touch with more specific information as spring term approaches."
Within the past two weeks, Massachusetts has seen a 55 percent increase in its average daily case count, with 5,656 new cases reported in the Commonwealth on Jan. 10.
In a follow-up email to undergraduate students Monday afternoon, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote that the College intends to “move forward with the residential plans for Spring 2021.”
Though roughly half of the undergraduate student body had been invited to return to campus for the spring semester, Khurana wrote that the number of students living on campus would not significantly increase from the fall, when only freshmen and select upperclassmen were offered housing.
“While we were at a 25% residential density in the fall, we expect only a modest increase in the spring to about 30% residential density,” Khurana wrote.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to provide specific numbers on enrollment or the residential population for the spring.
A December survey by the Harvard College Open Data Project found that just 50 percent of seniors and 40 percent of juniors intended to live in Harvard’s dorms in the spring.
In his email, Khurana urged students to “carefully read and adhere to” public health measures, including mask-wearing, physical distancing, and hand-washing. In addition, the College’s precautions for residential students include frequent Covid-19 testing and daily Crimson Clear attestations to affirm that students are not experiencing symptoms of the virus.
Since June 1, 2020, the University has seen 31 undergraduate and 136 graduate students test positive for the coronavirus, per Harvard’s official testing dashboard.
Still, Khurana emphasized the ever-changing nature of the public health emergency, writing that the College would “adapt if needed” due to public health concerns. If the College were to alter its spring plans, Khurana wrote, administrators would “be in touch directly with students who are moving back to campus or who are already living on campus.”
Bacow also encouraged Harvard affiliates in his email to get vaccinated when eligible. He stated that Harvard University Health Services is “in close contact with state officials” to ensure that vaccines are available “as quickly as possible.”
“For the time being, each of us must remain vigilant,” Bacow added.

Smitha S. H. Haneef will serve as the new Managing Director for Harvard University Dining Services, Harvard Campus Services announced Monday.
HUDS is a self-sustaining department under Campus Services that serves 22,000 meals daily during a typical school year and employs a staff of over 650 workers, according to a press release announcing Haneef’s appointment.
Haneef, currently an assistant vice president of University Services at Princeton University, will join the department in early April, according to the release.
In her role at Princeton, Haneef led a team of 400 employees to manage residential dining and other aspects of campus services, such as catering and athletic concessions. Prior to entering educational institutions, she worked in the private sector to develop dining services for several Fortune 500 companies.
Haneef is replacing outgoing Managing Director David P. Davidson, who retired in December after more than nine years in the role.
Davidson started at Harvard in 1991, when he was appointed general manager of Dudley Café. He left for seven years to work at Yale University, Back Bay Restaurant Group, and the Phillips Exeter Academy before returning to HUDS in 2007.
Haneef is arriving at a time when financial constraints due to the ongoing pandemic have led to the permanent closure of four HUDS facilities and potential layoffs for HUDS’s contracted employees. In addition, HUDS employees’ contract with the University will expire in June; negotiations over that contract led to a 22-day strike in 2016.
In Monday’s press release, Vice President for Campus Services Meredith Weenick ’90 praised Haneef’s commitment to Harvard’s goals of sustainability, diversity, innovation, and collaboration.
“We have found a leader who shares our institutional values and one who will build upon them to push the boundaries of excellence,” Weenick said.
Haneef said in the release that she was “honored” to join Harvard and serve in this capacity.
“Harvard’s dining program is renowned across the country for its innovation and creativity, and I look forward to helping HUDS build on its already impeccable reputation,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Custodians at Harvard ratified a year-long contract with the University last Friday that guarantees health benefits and a one-time bonus, but does not protect contracted custodians from impending layoffs.
The union leading the negotiations — 32BJ, the local chapter of the Service Employees International Union — represents about 700 custodians, in addition to approximately 300 security guards. The custodians’ agreement will expire Nov. 15, 2021, one year from the previous contract’s original expiration date.
Security guards ratified a separate one-year contract with their employer, Securitas, on Dec. 30, 2020.
Notably, the custodians’ contract does not include protections for contracted workers, who make up more than 40 percent of the custodial workforce. Since the onset of Covid-19 in March 2020, Harvard had extended pay and benefits for contracted workers idled by the pandemic, but it announced in November that it would end the policy on Jan. 15, 2021.
After that date, idled employees directly employed by the University can use emergency excused absences to keep 70 percent of their pay, while idled contracted workers will not receive pay.
Approximately 300 of the 700 custodians represented by 32BJ are employed by various subcontractors, 32BJ Vice President Roxana L. Rivera said in an interview.
Some of those employees — such as custodians at Harvard Business School — will be able to continue receiving pay under agreements with specific employers, but 173 contracted custodians will go without pay when the policy lapses, according to union bargaining committee member Luis M. Toribio.
Friday’s agreement guarantees that employers will keep covering healthcare costs for the custodians, and that every employee will receive a one-time bonus of up to $1,500, depending on how many hours they worked prior to the pandemic. The new contract also stipulates an additional $300 bonus for employees who worked on campus for 75 to 100 percent of their regularly scheduled hours from March to November and a $150 bonus for employees who worked 50 to 74 percent of their regularly scheduled hours.
Shop steward and bargaining committee member Doris E. Reina-Landaverde said that, although the union and the University reached an agreement, she feels unsatisfied with portions of the contract, such as the lack of job security for contracted employees.
“I’m not happy with what we got, because as essential workers, I feel the University has to recognize our job,” said Reina-Landaverde, who is a directly employed custodian. “We are in the front lines, [and] put our life at risk to protect the community.”
Reina-Landaverde added that she is “not happy” with the one-time bonus stipulated by the agreement instead of a wage increase, but she said the union had to settle for temporary protections given the uncertain situation for workers.
“Most of the workers were afraid to continue to rally,” Reina-Landaverde said, referring to the danger of the virus. “We had to just get the contract because it’s very important to be protected.”
Ultimately, 97 percent of those who voted favored ratifying the agreement, according to an email the union provided to The Crimson. Two-thirds of the membership participated in the vote.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is “pleased” to have made a tentative agreement with the union.
“We are grateful for the commitment to negotiating during what has been an unprecedented and unsettling year, and we are pleased to reach resolution despite complicating circumstances brought on by the pandemic,” Newton wrote.
According to Rivera, 32BJ is continuing to organize in order to secure paid leave for its contracted members. The union is also working with UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents the University’s food services workers and whose contracted employees are also facing imminent layoffs.
“What is still uncertain is, basically once the Covid emergency pay policy ends on January 15, what will happen to the contracted workers that may be sent home due to lack of work in the spring semester,” Rivera said. “We are going to continue that effort.”
Paula G. Martinez, a contracted custodian at the Business School and member of the bargaining committee, said she doesn’t agree with the distinction between directly-employed and contracted workers.
“It’s true we’re under subcontractors,” she said. “But we’re not doing anything different that direct hires are doing — we’re cleaning, we’re disinfecting.”
Toribio, who is directly employed, echoed Martinez’s sentiment.
“We want to support those contracted workers because we are the same,” he said. “We are coworkers. We are brothers and sisters.”
Toribio said the union is turning to the contractors and individual graduate schools to provide protections for contracted workers. Besides the Business School, Toribio said he is unaware of any other schools that have changed their policies per the union’s requests.
While Martinez said she is happy with the extension of wages and benefits under the new year-long contract, she ultimately voted against it because it did not provide job security for contracted custodians.
“I’m happy that we have the benefits, but we have nothing on paper to say that we are helping our co-workers keep their jobs,” she said.
In the meantime, ground organizing is underway. The union plans to hold a masked and socially-distanced action on campus Thursday at noon, according to 32BJ SEIU spokesperson Amanda Torres-Price.
For now, Toribio said custodians will have to wait for the individual schools and contractors to decide on policies for contracted workers.
“After that, we will see what we can do,” he said.

Boston City Councilor At-Large Michelle Wu ’07 and a group of Cambridge city councilors urged Harvard to extend its paid leave policy to contracted workers in letters addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow on Dec. 11 and Jan. 9, respectively.
In her letter, Wu calls on Harvard to support its workers by extending the University’s excused absence pay policy to contracted custodial, food service, and other staff.
“Harvard has an important role to play in ensuring our communities survive this unprecedented crisis, as well as an obligation to support the workers who have dedicated their careers to keeping the campus clean and safe, and who have made it possible for students to thrive,” Wu wrote.
Cambridge city councilors Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, E. Denise Simmons, Quinton Y. Zondervan, Marc C. McGovern, and Tim J. Toomey similarly urged Harvard to maintain paid leave for contracted workers.
“We’re urging you to be on the right side of history and continue to extend your paid leave policy to contracted workers,” the Cambridge city councilors’ letter reads. “ The city of Cambridge, your students, and your dedicated workers will benefit from this bold move and will thank you for it for years to come.”
The University has provided both directly-employed and contracted workers with full pay and benefits since March; however, on Nov. 12, Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp announced changes to the emergency excused absence policy.
“As most parts of the campus remain closed, and the financial impacts to the University continue, there are limits to our ability to do so indefinitely,” Lapp wrote.
From Jan. 15, idled directly-employed Harvard workers will be able to receive up to 70 percent of their regular pay but idled contract workers will not receive pay.
In response, 32BJ — a local branch of the Service Employees International Union that represents hundreds of Harvard custodians — organized rallies and circulated a petition calling on Harvard to extend protections to contracted workers.
Both letters praised Harvard for its emergency pay policy but ultimately expressed disappointment in the new leave policy, especially as the coronavirus continues to surge in Cambridge.
“If they lose these jobs, they and their families may never recover, even after the pandemic ends,” reads Wu’s letter.
The councilors also emphasized the disproportionate impact the coronavirus has had on workers of color.
“During this difficult time for many working families — especially those who are Black, brown, and immigrant — it is more important than ever that well-resourced institutions commit to ensuring that their workers continue to have income security and health benefits,” Wu wrote.
The Cambridge city councilors added in their letter that that frontline workers deserve “peace of mind” from income insecurity.
“Those who do this work — many of whom have been on the frontlines of the pandemic — need and deserve this peace of mind regardless of whether they are contracted or employed directly,” they wrote.
They also pointed to the recent rollout of coronavirus vaccines as another reason not to exclude contracted workers from Harvard’s leave policy.
“Now is the time to hold on and maintain stability, not make drastic decisions that could destabilize the lives of those who keep Harvard clean and safe,” they added.
Roxana L. Rivera, vice president of 32BJ SEIU, wrote that the union is grateful for the support its workers have found in a trying time.
“The outpouring of support among elected officials from many facets of state and local government for the Harvard contracted workers has helped our workforce remain united and hopeful in fighting for their jobs,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson.

Harvard announced the candidates nominated for positions on the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — and for elected directorships in the Harvard Alumni Association on Tuesday.
The Board of Overseers is responsible for providing input on decisions about the direction of the University, advising top Harvard administrators, and approving certain actions by the University’s highest governing board, the Harvard Corporation. Its members serve six-year terms.
The eight Harvard alumni contending for the five anticipated vacancies on the Board work in a wide array of professional fields and live in the United States, Canada, and Spain. They are: Oncology Impact Fund managing director and Burrage Capital founder Christiana G. Bardon; United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance Mark J. Carney ’87; Principal and Director of Business Development at HOK Group Kimberly N. Dowdell; Robert Morris University President Christopher B. Howard; President and CEO of Voto Latino Maria T. Kumar; United States Circuit Judge Raymond J. Lohier Jr. ’88; Partnership on AI founding executive director Terah E. Lyons ’14; and journalist and Fullsky Partners co-founder Sheryl WuDunn.
Alumni can nominate additional candidates through a petition process, which requires 2,987 signatures from eligible voters by Feb 3.
Harvard Forward — a student and alumni organization working to call attention to climate action and racial justice issues within the University’s governance boards — has proposed three Board of Overseers candidates to be nominated by petition: Yvette O. Efevbera, Megan H. Red Shirt-Shaw, and Natalie Unterstell.
The group successfully elected by petition three of its five nominees to the Board of Overseers’ five vacant spots in the 2020 election, making it the first campaign to successfully petition a candidate for the position in over three decades. Less than a month after the election’s conclusion, the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers jointly imposed a new policy disallowing more than six petition-backed candidates from sitting on the Board at any time, drawing heavy criticism from Harvard Forward representatives and supporters.
Elected directors of the Harvard Alumni Association serve as representatives for alumni across the University and focus on increasing alumni engagement worldwide. The nine candidates vying for six available seats are: MTV Entertainment Group Vice President Whitney S. F. Baxter ’07; co-founder and CEO of AdVon Commerce Benjamin T. Faw; spaceport development lead at SpaceX Jane A. Labanowski ’17; human resources business partner at Curriculum Associates Hannah M. Park ’13; Director of the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT Tenzin Priyadarshi; author Rebecca C. Ribaudo ’93; founding partner of Portobello Capital Íñigo Sánchez-Asiaín; CareDx Senior Director George A. Thampy ’10; and television writer and producer Maiya W. Verrone ’84.
Elections will begin April 1 and close May 18 at 5 p.m. All Harvard degree holders are eligible to vote for Harvard Alumni Association elected directors either online or by traditional paper ballot. All Harvard degree holders — except members of the Harvard Corporation and alumni in University instruction or governance positions — are eligible to vote for the Board candidates.

Harvard Government professor Ryan D. Enos called on the University to adopt “minimum standards” for affiliation with Harvard that “include supporting free elections and not encouraging violence” in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow on Sunday.
Enos — the director of graduate studies for the Government department — wrote that Harvard should create guidelines that prevent individuals who had a role in aiding the riots at the Capitol last Wednesday, which left five dead, from being affiliated with the University.
“If we do not insist that those at Harvard do not try to overturn the free and fair votes of other citizens or that they would not encourage the violent overthrow of our own government, then we have no standards at all,” he wrote.
Enos’ letter comes as the Harvard Institute of Politics faces mounting pressure to sever ties with U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.), who sits on the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee and backed efforts to block the certification of electors for President-elect Joe Biden.
Separately, a letter calling on Harvard to adopt “accountability guidelines” for welcoming officials who served in the Trump administration — which was signed by over 300 affiliates — was sent to Bacow on Wednesday evening by Kennedy School student Diego A. Garcia Blum.
In the past, many bureaucrats and outgoing officials have flocked to lecture at the Kennedy School or serve as IOP fellows.
In an interview on Sunday, Enos said he hopes Bacow will convene scholars from across the University to “come up with a policy that upholds the values that Harvard should uphold” in welcoming affiliates.
“When we cross such a bright line as inviting violence into our system of government, that’s the point where we have to say, ‘we need to stand up and say that anybody that has crossed that line should not be part of our community,’” he said.
“We can argue about who encouraged that and who didn’t, but we can all agree that that event itself is a bright line that we have to say cannot be crossed,” he added.
Enos said there are discussions among other faculty members and graduate students about how to push collectively for such guidelines.
Bacow sent Enos a letter in response on Sunday evening, but it was not made public.
In a statement, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote, “President Bacow was grateful for Professor Enos’s thoughtful message and looks forward to continuing discussion with he and others on these important matters.”
Among those Enos referenced in his letter are emeritus faculty who have publicly defended Trump following the riots. Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz, who joined Trump’s legal team during the 2020 impeachment trial, has offered repeatedly to defend Trump again should the House impeach him a second time.
In the letter, Enos also noted the importance of preserving academic freedom and the need for more conservative voices on campus, but wrote that Harvard holds a responsibility to act as “a leader in righting the ship of our democracy.”
“Academic freedom does not mean that you don’t have any ethical standards about who you invite into your university, and clearly violence is unethical,” he told The Crimson. “What it means is that once a person is part of your university, that no ideas are something that they can be punished for.”
Acknowledging that removing and barring people from the University requires a drastic decision, he urged Harvard administrators to publicly announce the school’s position on the issue soon.
“I strongly believe nobody who aided a violent insurrection should be welcome at our university,” Enos wrote. “Unless politicians are pressured by civic institutions to change their ways, they will not repent and the horrible events at the Capitol on Wednesday may just be the beginning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 70 Harvard student organizations from across the University signed a statement demanding the release of Ekpar Asat — the brother of Rayhan Asat, Harvard Law School’s first Uighur graduate — from a Xinjiang internment camp.
The statement, written by the Harvard Law School Advocates for Human Rights, calls for the “immediate release” of Ekpar Asat and for “swift accountability for the mass atrocities continuing to be committed against this ethnic group.”
“As Harvard students, we lend our support to Rayhan Asat in her fight to secure her brother’s release and seek justice for the Uighur community,” the statement reads. “We join widespread calls for the United States government and the international community to demand that the Chinese government end their long-standing and systematic oppression of the Uighur ethnic minority.”
International human rights groups estimate more than 1 million people have been held in the so-called “re-education” camps, and allege that ethnic Muslims are subjected to religious persecution and forced sterilization in the camps. In response to what it called human rights violations, the United States issued sanctions against several Chinese officials involved in July.
Rayhan Asat said she was surprised that the Chinese government chose to detain her brother, particularly given his dearth of anti-government activity.
“I just never thought it would happen to my brother because he’s never critical of the Chinese government,” she said.
Ekpar Asat, a tech entrepreneur and philanthropist, founded a social media platform for Uighurs in his college years. In 2016, Asat participated in the U.S. Department of State’s International Visitor Leadership Program, which boasts alumni including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and United Nations Secretary-General António Gueterres.
“The Chinese government did approve him to come to this trip — it’s a government-approved trip between the United States and China,” Rayhan Asat said. “And the program is designed to promote [the] U.S.-China relationship.”
When Ekpar Asat came to the U.S. to attend the program, he and his sister made arrangements for their immediate family to return to America for Rayhan Asat’s graduation from the Law School.
“Our agreement was that he would be coming back for my graduation in two months time — he got the visa and everything,” Asat said, who is a U.S. permanent resident. “We thought that we were going to see each other — never had I ever thought that would be the last time I’d be seeing him.”
Asat’s brother disappeared three weeks after his return from the U.S. Her parents told her that they would no longer be able to attend her Law School graduation as planned because a family member was ill, but Asat suspected something was wrong.
It was only four years later — in January 2020 — that she got official confirmation of what had happened. She met with members of Congress to advocate for her brother in December 2019, who then sent a letter asking the Chinese government about the whereabouts of Ekpar Asat.
In response, Beijing officials said that Ekpar Asat had been sentenced to fifteen years in prison for “inciting ethnic hatred and ethnic discrimination.”
The charges against Asat were a "sham" and he was imprisoned with "no trial, no lawyer, no evidence, no due process, no justice," according to tweets from the U.S. State Department.
Law School student Sondra R. P. Anton, director of activism at HLS’s Advocates for Human Rights, said the writers of the statement strived to humanize Rayhan Asat’s story. Anton said that, too often, mass atrocity and genocide are rendered “faceless” and “nameless.”
“Rayhan could have been any of us,” she said.
Tzofiya M. Bookstein ’23, who first became involved in Uighur advocacy last spring, said she was able to contribute to Rayhan Asat’s campaign through collaborating with the Jewish Movement for Uighur Freedom, an international initiative she helped found in 2020.
“Something that was really amazing with this petition was that the network kind of activated, and I could bring in people who I had worked with in my own community to amplify this petition and have them reach out to their networks,” Bookstein said. “It was a really amazing way to bring the two initiatives together.”
Rebecca S. Araten ’22, a former Crimson News editor involved with the Jewish Movement for Uighur Freedom, highlighted the breadth of student organizations that had signed the statement, many of which hold no political affiliations.
“There are progressive organizations, there are cultural and affinity organizations, there are pre-med related organizations, and just a lot of groups that are seeing this issue not as something political,” she said. “They’re signing on because this is a human rights issue, and there’s no way to not support Ekpar and his freedom.”
Rebecca N. Thrope ’22, a member of the campaign, wrote in an email that she was moved by Rayhan Asat’s consideration for supporters despite her difficult situation.
“Working with Rayhan has taught me so much about the care it takes to sustain this effort,” Thrope wrote. “She time and time again cares for us as she boosts our morale and pushes us to achieve more ambitious goals.”
Rayhan Asat wrote an opinion piece for The Crimson in June of 2020, in which she details the story of her brother, his detainment, and her advocacy efforts that demand the Chinese government release Ekpar from the Xinjiang detention center.
“Many of you will be shapers and movers of our society,” Asat wrote in her editorial. “Therefore, I ask you: Join the fight, be the light, be the integrity, be the voice for my brother, and my people. Because you are my people too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will not apply for federal aid from the latest Congressional Covid-19 stimulus package, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in a statement Monday.
The University was estimated to receive $7 million in aid from the legislation, according to a Jan. 7 simulation by the American Council on Education, a higher education interest group.
In April, multiple members of Congress — as well as President Donald J. Trump — criticized the University for receiving nearly $9 million in aid as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. The University ultimately elected to decline the funding.
Newton wrote in the statement that Harvard was concerned that uneven guidelines could deprive undocumented students of aid.
“We remain concerned that this legislation does not provide institutions with clear authority to assist all our students who are experiencing impacts from the pandemic, including Dreamers,” Newton wrote.
Former Education Secretary Betsy D. DeVos — who stepped down Friday — issued guidance in April that undocumented students who receive federal protections could not receive federal aid. That rule was not repealed in the latest stimulus package.
Newton also criticized a provision of the legislation that would decrease by 50 percent the aid provided to colleges impacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, colloquially referred to as the endowment tax.
“While we appreciate that members of Congress have acknowledged the urgent need for relief for higher education institutions and their students, we do not agree with the harmful limitations placed on this relief based on damaging taxes on nonprofits included in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” Newton wrote.
Several of Harvard’s peer institutions have not yet announced whether they will accept the aid. Yale University, Stanford University, and MIT are slated to receive roughly $4.5 million, $5.3 million, and $3.5 million, respectively, in federal aid according to the American Council on Education simulation. Yale, Stanford and MIT all declined to accept their stimulus funding in the spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.) was removed from the Institute of Politics’s Senior Advisory Committee Tuesday morning, Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced in a letter sent to members of the committee.
The decision comes after hundreds of Harvard affiliates circulated a petition last week calling on the IOP to sever ties with Stefanik for “improperly challenging” the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win and “enabling violence” during Wednesday’s riot in Washington, D.C. that left five people dead.
Elmendorf wrote that his decision to remove Stefanik from the committee, which he made in consultation with IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78, was not related to “political parties, political ideology, or her choice of candidate for president,” but rather her false claims of voter fraud.
“In my assessment, Elise has made public assertions about voter fraud in November’s presidential election that have no basis in evidence, and she has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect,” Elmendorf wrote. “These assertions and statements do not reflect policy disagreements but bear on the foundations of the electoral process through which this country’s leaders are chosen.”
Elmendorf also wrote that he provided Stefanik the opportunity to step down from the committee, but she refused.
“In my conversation with Elise, she declined to step aside, and I told her that I would therefore remove her from the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee at this time,” he wrote.
In a statement posted to her Twitter account, Stefanik decried the decision as “Harvard’s Bowing to the Far-Left.” She wrote that she believes her removal from the leadership committee sends a message to conservative students that Harvard does not respect their views.
“The decision by Harvard’s administration to cower and cave to the woke Left will continue to erode diversity of thought, public discourse, and ultimately the student experience,” she wrote. “The Ivory Tower’s march toward a monoculture of like-minded, intolerant liberal views demonstrates the sneering disdain for everyday Americans and will instill a culture of fear for students who will understand that a conservative viewpoint will not be tolerated and will be silenced.”
“Congratulations Harvard, the entire Board of the Institute of Politics now consists of only Joe Biden voters - how reflective of America,” Stefanik added.
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith declined to comment further on Stefanik's removal.
In his letter, Elmendorf acknowledged Stefanik’s “important contributions” to the IOP during her undergraduate years as a student leader and, after, as a mentor.
“I know that we are grateful for her long and committed service,” he wrote.
The authors of the petition calling for Stefanik’s removal, Megan O. Corrigan ’16 and Jacob R. Carrel ’16, wrote in an email that they believe the IOP’s action on Tuesday strengthens democracy.
“We’re very thankful that we can say that no insurrectionist will be held up as a role model at the IOP,” they wrote. “We support free speech and the free exchange of ideas, and we’re proud that the IOP will continue to uphold those values while standing up for truth and democracy. Harvard is a stronger institution because of today’s decision.”
