After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Charlotte Wells’s feature directorial debut “Aftersun,” which premiered in the Semaine de la Critique selection of the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on May 21, begins with the familiar whir of winding tape — though perhaps more familiar to some generations than others. Shaky home movies shot on a ’90s-era camcorder are interspersed throughout the film, adding a sentimental layer to Wells’s family drama.
“Aftersun” forgoes a conventional narrative structure by focusing on the day-to-day experiences of a young Scottish father named Calum (Paul Mescal) and his eleven-year-old daughter Sophie (Frankie Corio) on their vacation to Istanbul. Natural performances from the always charming yet brooding Paul Mescal and precocious newcomer Frankie Corio complement each other to create an authentic rapport onscreen. While the film ends too obliquely to understand some of its overarching messages, it is still a deeply felt examination of familial connection, with all of its joys and complications.
While “Aftersun” hones in on just a few days of Calum and Sopie’s lives, there are subtle hints throughout the film that the adult Sophie is looking back at the memories of their vacation many years later. So intimately observed that the viewer feels like a third family member on vacation with the duo, “Aftersun” is a bittersweet and nostalgic time capsule. The simplistic plot has no call-to-action or even a specific issue or emotion it hones in on, but Wells’s script doesn’t need a typical narrative arc to make a serious emotional impression. Viewers are simply taken through the highs and lows of Sophie and Calum’s vacation to Turkey, with the two of them periodically filming each other with a handheld camera (or, in Sophie’s case, often turning the camera around to face herself). Naturally, this lends the film a distinctly homemade quality. For any ’90s or Y2K kids who grew up with their childhoods documented on camcorders and played back on VHS tapes, “Aftersun” feels like a reflection of their own experiences.
Mescal shines as the 30-year-old Calum — a playful, affectionate, and flawed father, whose age often makes people confuse him for Sophie’s older brother. With his youthful behavior, he toes the line between friend and father to the curious and independent Sophie. Corio is also fantastic, enlivening her character with her abundance of charm. The pair’s trip is observed languidly: some scenes show them laying by the poolside, Calum insisting he put another layer of sunscreen on Sophie. They eat countless dinners together, talking about anything and everything. Mescal and Corio are a phenomenal duo, carrying a huge weight as the main talent in such a character-focused film. They maintain a quippy back-and-forth and share a mischievous sense of humor as they laugh at jokes that only they understand.
While their lives outside the trip are largely left unknown, viewers slowly gather some information about the pair. It’s alluded to that Calum is the type of person who embarks on random business ventures, only to fail or abandon them soon after, come up with a new idea, and repeat the cycle. Although Calum is by no means a perfect dad — he makes several increasingly questionable parenting decisions that are never unpacked — his openness with his daughter is moving. He insists she can talk to him about anything, and Mescal makes it easy to believe in his sincerity.
“Aftersun” is also visually dynamic, with a bright and sunny color palette evoking the lazy freedom of summer’s hottest days. Wells also makes creative use of reflections — in mirrors, on TVs, on the shiny surfaces of tables — and observing her characters from these unique vantages calls special attention to the film’s meditative tone. The director’s incorporation of home videos, which confer a nostalgic aesthetic, allow for moments of temporal distortion and ambiguity. The clips are used in such a way that viewers are unsure of whether someone is looking back on the footage from the future, or if the recorded events are happening in real time.
In regards to the retrospective element of “Aftersun,” Wells’s story is frustratingly ambiguous. Inserted at odd intervals throughout Calum and Sophie’s vacation are strobe-lit club scenes, in which an adult woman and Calum can barely be seen in a throng of dancing people. These fever dream cutaways leave the viewer intrigued, wondering how they’ll eventually fit into the story. Coupled with some increasingly worrisome behavior from Calum, in which he seems to be hiding a deep sadness from his daughter, “Aftersun” feels like it’s leading up to a revelation that will tie its two timelines together.
As it’s revealed that Sophie is looking back at the old VHS footage many years later — now a parent herself — a myriad of questions arise: How is Sophie’s reminiscing connected to Calum’s strange behavior? How does she feel as an adult looking back on this trip now that she too has a child to care for? What is her relationship like with her dad in the present day, if he’s still around? Wells leaves all of these questions unanswered, only briefly touching on the fact that the trip to Istanbul is now a decades-old memory. Ambiguous endings are often the best endings, but “Aftersun” perhaps takes this ethos too far.
Even with all the lingering questions viewers are left with, “Aftersun” is still a beautiful portrait of Calum and Sophie’s relationship. Their trip takes place right before Sophie will start a new school year, and watching “Aftersun” transports viewers right back to the bittersweet feelings of those final days of summer — of wanting them to last forever, but knowing they cannot.

In the Valencian village where Spanish director Elena López Riera’s “El Agua” unfolds, the mundane and the mythological tangle together. Townspeople fascinate over the lore of water, and the whispers of its wrath loom over the area even on clear days. In her debut feature, which premiered on May 20 at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, Riera uses these legends as a lens through which to examine the lives of a young couple, delving into their connection with (and resistance toward) their families, their surroundings, and their futures. Where its premise might suggest a supernatural thriller, the film instead unravels as a vivid and emotive slice-of-life movie, beautifully tracking the blossoming romance between Ana (Luna Pamiés) and Jose (Alberto Olmo).
From early moments, the film’s mythological element appears as a figure of public imagination. Reminders of the mysterious water-power are everywhere. Audiences first meet Ana and her friends as they lounge on concrete river banks, recuperating after a night out and recounting legends of the river’s hungry spirit. When announcements of imminent rain prompt fears that the water will surge and drag the land under, Ana begins to pray for the embrace of the river, hoping to excise the sadness and fear that trouble her. Riera illustrates how, for a teenage girl wracked with uncertainty about her life and her choices, surrender to the river has its appeal.
In the realm of popular legend, Riera illustrates, the river appears as a force of undeniable will and powerful acceptance; when it sets its sight on a village girl, as happens often in the local stories, it’ll lure her in and embrace her, never to be seen again. As the film develops, Riera isn’t interested in portraying the supernatural or representing the spirit outright. Instead, myth acts as an entry point into Ana and Jose’s adolescent struggles for independence and opportunity, illuminating the general connections and legacies that keep them connected to the place.
The film opens with Ana and Jose flirting beside the river to the lighthearted ribbing of their rowdy, charismatic friend group. From these early beats, the film’s portrayal of adolescence feels authentic, crackling with the energy and familiarity of real friendships, uncertain plans, and general restlessness. Riera’s finest skill as a writer-director is immediately on display: She expertly wields dialogue-heavy scenes to create immersive worlds within each family and friend group, making the audience feel that they are there beside the characters, listening.
In a film concerned with generational storytelling and myths that have been passed down between women, Riera takes time to naturally show how Ana talks to her mother, grandmother, and aunt to process and understand her place in the world, learning from their advice and rebelling against their example. True to adolescent life, these conversations are not always smooth sailing, and the characters cut each other down with harsh words. Ultimately, though, these moments of conflict only reinforce the importance of the constant conversation between Ana and the women around her that acts as the bedrock of the film.
The town’s iconic river myths mirror the legends that Riera herself grew up hearing about in Valencia (in the same village where the movie was shot, and where she made her previous short films). As Riera told audiences on the Croisette at the Quinzaine de Réalisateurs screening on May 20, she started the film out of a desire to delve into the mythologies in the region and the women who passed them down. This goal manifests in an unusual documentary addition to the film, in the form of real interview clips detailing different women’s memory of the water story and its impact. Like Nora Ephron’s meet-cute interviews in “When Harry Met Sally,” the clips occasionally interrupt the storyline to offer one woman’s recollection of a particular element or impact of the folklore. The clips layer the sense of collective investment in the myths, but they also occasionally feel aesthetically mismatched with the otherwise cohesive, immersive visual style Riera delivers.
The rest of the film follows Ana’s sleepy summer working at her mother’s struggling roadside bar and spending time with Jose, who dedicates himself to learning his family farming business at his father’s behest, only to quickly realize the burdens and restrictions of that work. Riera embraces a bright, sun-drenched, and even dusty (in the best possible sense) palette in the film. Gorgeous scenes of natural light in river canyons and flashing dance parties on the outskirts of town create the visceral sensation of summer passing, bringing viewers into the arid world of the film. Still, as Riera illustrates, the easy, slow atmosphere in the town belies the social exclusion facing Ana’s single mother and the economic pressure bearing down on Jose and his father. The town, like the river, is not as relaxed as it seems. Its teenagers will have to decide whether to stay and risk getting trapped by routine or strike out in the world alone.
As Ana shifts from enjoying lazy afternoons in the river to fearing the force of the water and later testing the truth of the myths she heard, Riera reinforces the river’s simultaneous danger and freedom, showing its appeal for young people torn between different paths, tired of enduring the trials of their lives, and eager for a sense of belonging in a greater cause. But where Riera excels at illustrating Ana and Jose’s passions and fears through beautiful dialogue and illuminating exposition, she never really delves into the specific causes of Ana’s attraction to the river. Viewers are left to imagine how her various worries connect to her nearly religious fascination with the water, which weakens the effect of the interconnected mythology and coming-of-age plotlines.
In its final stages, the film becomes increasingly eerie and foreboding without explanation, giving minimal insight into Ana’s changing relationship to the water even as it cuts to interviews of non-actors discussing their beliefs. After audiences have spent nearly two hours getting to know the everyday details and stresses of the main characters’ lives, the finale feels vague and unsatisfying, pivoting suddenly away from the film’s affecting naturalism and towards vague surrealism.
Despite its underwhelming finish, “El Agua” offers a vivid and transportative glimpse of the relationships, stories, and fears that shape Ana’s life, framed by the mythology that has haunted the women of her town for generations. Riera’s portrait of adolescence — and the bonds and rifts that tie families together and tear them apart — achieves a rare degree of realism, focusing not on the magical creatures of mythology but instead on the real people who grew up with them. It’s a fitting, unique addition to a Cannes lineup that celebrates the impact and history of storytelling in a variety of contexts, from George Miller’s “Three Thousand Years of Longing” to Ali Abassi’s “Holy Spider.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mathieu Vadepied’s new film “Tirailleurs” (“Father and Soldier”), which premiered on May 19 at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, takes a bracing look at the forced conscription and exploitation of soldiers from colonial Africa in World War I, a horrific aspect of the war that has often gone unseen in popular war cinema. As it weaves together two central plotlines — a Senegalese conscript’s efforts to escape the bloody front with his son and return to their village, and their French commander’s brash efforts to take back a German-controlled hill — the film imbues a fresh skepticism into the war-thriller genre, challenging the glorification of wartime sacrifice. Though the film sometimes seems to succumb to the exploitative pretense it aims to challenge — that the urgency of the war required colonial subjects to put aside their objections to French rule and help — as a complete work it is an important addition to the canon of World War I cinema, shedding light on the abuse and devastation inflicted on colonized African nations in the name of the European war effort.
The film follows Bakary Diallo (Omar Sy, in a heart-wrenching performance), a Senegalese herdsman who volunteers to join France’s auxiliary unit of African soldiers — known as “tirailleurs” — after French authorities raid his village and abduct his son Thierno (Allisane Diong) as a conscript. What unfolds is a sprawling epic that covers their journey across Europe and through the war, tracing their diverging attitudes toward the conflict. Bakary’s resolve to get his son out of the war deepens even as their surroundings descend into a living nightmare, while Thierno falls in with a young, grandiose French Lieutenant Chambreau (Jonas Bloquet) and becomes increasingly convinced of the importance of their fight on the front as he resigns himself to life in the army. Through their stories, Vadepied tracks two distinct perspectives on the war, one driven by family allegiance and the other by military duty.
The latter of these motivations, as embodied by Theirno, feels familiar as the standard narrative outlook of most war movies. Thierno’s arc focuses on his growing investment in the fight against the Central Powers, which is where he believes he can have an impact, unite with his brethren in the military, and assist the war cause. His beliefs mirror the attitude and environment of tormented heroism that tends to suffuse military thrillers. The extended fighting sequences on the front reflect those films in their suspense-building tactics, which highlight that the ultimate goal of every character is to achieve their military goals (and survive, if they can). Sy’s character, on the other hand, introduces a third perspective existing outside of military calculus. Instead of the abstract French preoccupation with protecting the motherland, he’s guided by his parental protectiveness over his son; Thierno’s safe return to Senegal is the only priority, and if he can save his son by deserting the front, he will.
Vadepied portrays both characters’ development in depth but focuses more on Sy’s perspective, unseating tragic military heroism from its valorized place at the top of the hierarchy of war-film motivations. Bakary’s goal comes across as far more immediate, important, and intuitive than the military triumph Chambreau and later Thierno are willing to risk everything for, and his appears as the only viewpoint — compared to the Allied and Central authorities — unaffected by delusions of military victory and actually concerned with the lives and survival of the tirailleurs.
As Thierno is drawn further into the French military effort and places himself in greater and greater danger, his father’s increasingly frantic efforts to pull him back feel like the only option to save his life in the face of the war’s apathetic vortex of violence. Beyond the principled element, Sy and Diong’s performances and the in-depth emotional realism of their arc lend heart to the story and constantly reinforce its mortal stakes, delivering an engrossing and affecting viewing experience.
Through these techniques, Vadepied’s war film — which often feels like a standard war drama in other respects, such as its battle sequences and camp scenes — questions the moral legitimacy of the French army’s conscription tactics and questions why Senegalese soldiers are forced to give their lives in service of an empire that does not treat them as human. Vadepied makes a meaningful commentary about French abuse against colonial subjects in the name of the war effort, illustrating how the nationalistic ideals so often parrotted in war films are weaponized against marginalized people during wartime.
That being said, “Father and Soldier” certainly has its issues. Once Bakary and Thierno arrive in France, the French authorities are rarely shown and the film mainly shows Thierno’s blossoming friendship with Chambreau, who constantly reiterates that their differing ranks shouldn’t affect their friendship. The question of how their different racial and political statuses within the French empire informs their dynamic (Chambrea being the white son of a commander and Thierno being a Black abductee from a region colonized by France) is never thoughtfully broached. Though Bakary implicitly presents the idea that the conscripts are fighting for a power that will not recognize them or respect their freedoms, Vadepied doesn’t carry this idea through in the third act and never substantially delves into the institutional French attitude toward tirailleurs once they arrived in the theater of war.
History shows that tirailleurs were again conscripted and exploited in World War II, after which they were sidelined and deprived of equal pensions by the French military, yet this important piece of context — affirming Bakary’s argument — doesn’t feature in the film. When Vadepied cuts ahead from the end of WWI to the present day, where the film discusses the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and its connection to the slain tirailleurs who were left where they fell, he skips this context. Accordingly, his portrayal of the French institutional attitude toward tirailleurs in Europe — in essence, what Bakary was up against — does not feel fully sketched out. At times, it feels unethical to mine the traumatic experience of the tirailleurs in the war for cinematic suspense, as in the fast-paced No Man’s Land sequences, without providing a full historical picture of their experience and their continual lack of recognition, effectively glossing over their treatment after the war.
Ultimately, “Father and Soldier” takes the shape of a classic war film. The film’s cinematic atmosphere is marked by immersive production design showing the war-wracked villages of France, a series of fast frontline action sequences, and the bombastic momentum of a battlefield movie. But there is value, in itself, in telling this classic war story with a focus on the tirailleurs and the unique dangers and prejudice they faced. Indeed, the cinematic record of the war is not complete unless it gives voice to their mistreatment, and Vadepied’s film is an important, if flawed, addition to the canon.

Korean actor and director Lee Jung-jae makes his feature directorial debut with the May 20 premiere of his 2022 Cannes Film Festival film “Hunt” (헌트), a moody but distractingly convoluted spy caper that follows South Korean counterintelligence agents searching for a North Korean mole amidst the explosive political climate of the 1980s. From its opening scene, the film offers an engaging portrait of the everyday dangers and bureaucratic infighting in an intelligence agency servicing the Korean military dictatorship, delivering a John Le Carré-esque double-agent whodunit. But the film drags under the weight of its countless plot twists and extended third act, which see its mole escape detection so many times it becomes outlandish. By the film’s finale, its potential resonance has faded, flattening into a general parable on the unwinnable ethics of spycraft that rings hollow after two hours spent glorifying it.
“Hunt” kicks off with a bang, opening on a narrowly-foiled plot to assassinate the South Korean president that disrupts his visit to Washington. It’s a cataclysmic moment for Park Pyong-ho (Lee Jung-jae), the high-ranking leader of the KCIA’s foreign operations, as the plot renews suspicions of a mole in the top ranks of the agency. When Park’s operation to rescue a defecting North Korean scientist in Japan gets leaked and the extraction goes awry, the whispers about a double agent rise to a fever pitch, and Park redirects his attention toward rooting out the leak. Unfortunately, he’s not the only one looking; his rival Kim Jung-do (Jung Woo-sung), a former soldier and the head of the KCIA’s domestic unit, begins his own search, sparking a feverish race for leads.
Over the course of the first two acts, the search goes off the rails, descending into a vicious spat between Park and Kim over agency control as clues into the leak lead nowhere and North Korean intelligence stays one step ahead. Though the rivalry initially brings welcome variation and interpersonal depth to the espionage thriller, it is quickly exaggerated beyond believability, ratcheting up in a series of ridiculous slights and culminating in an actual brawl in the lobby of the KCIA (which somehow affects neither man’s career). The juvenile pettiness of the entire conflict comes at the cost of the agency’s functionality, making it impossible to believe the leads are dedicated or clear-sighted spies worth following for an earnest 130-minute tale of heroism.
Beyond that, Park and Kim’s rivalry is epically confusing, requiring that audiences follow the intricacies of their jurisdictional disputes in order to track the progression of the mole-hunt. The film is sparse on explanation and dense with action sequences, preferring to thrust its main characters into confrontations or chases rather than catching anyone up on their constantly-shifting allegiances. Though this approach allows the film to avoid any overreliance on exposition, its plot becomes too complicated for its minimalistic dialogue, and audiences are left to fill in the blanks on character motivations, key details, and chronological progression — all of which could have been addressed at some point in the film’s luxuriant runtime.
These, though, are the hazards of the espionage-caper genre, which usually relies on subtle twistiness to build suspense (as hard-to-follow hits like “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” illustrate). To its credit, the film also delivers much of what makes spy thrillers so fun — fast paced chases, hidden messages, stakeouts, and a constantly-shifting landscape of shady characters who at turns seem trustworthy and insidious. Jung Woo-sung gives a particularly engaging, tortured performance as Kim Jung-do, and his character’s arc feels the most authentically human and surprising of any plot in the film. But the movie cheapens its central conflict, as well as its historical immersiveness, with a third act so fractured by plot twists that they lose all gravity. For fear of spoiling the movie, suffice it to say that the questions of which people are plotting what for whom (and why) become nearly impossible to answer from one moment to the next. It’s a relief that the identity of the mole, at least, comes across clearly — but the character’s reasoning is minimally explored, their countless lies never probed, and the consequences they face in the film’s universe unsatisfying and unbelievable.
For those who can keep up with the constantly shifting heroes and villains of the story, the ending offers a grim takeaway: In the high-stakes game of espionage, few escape with their lives, much less their integrity. It’s a classic message across espionage thrillers, which doesn’t make it any less insightful if well-executed. However, this idea comes up abruptly at the end of a film that has constantly highlighted the agents’ ability to make a crucial impact on global politics, particularly as they connect to two authoritarian regimes: the North Korean Kim dynasty, which the KCIA is working against, and their own abusive government in South Korea, which they begin to question after the violent response to the Gwangju Uprising. The movie’s jaded conclusion, and its lack of consequence outside of the continuation of the status quo, feel like a haphazard attempt at commentary rather than the natural end of a cohesive narrative.
With “Hunt,” audiences will find a familiar spy story populated by archetypal secret agents, and they may enjoy tracing the complex route the film takes to finally reveal its secrets. But they’ll also likely walk away with more questions than answers, and the film’s rehashing of spy-movie tropes does not feel worth the two hours it spends doing it.

Dear Harvard Class of 2022,
Today is the day. The one so many of us have been anxiously awaiting since we took our first steps in Harvard Yard. And it is so bittersweet.
With the excitement of our next chapters after Harvard comes nostalgia for the years that we have spent growing up here together. Nostalgia for the Annenberg rush during Sunday brunch, the late night study sessions in Lamont, the concerts where we watched our friends perform, the everlasting dining hall dinners.
The end of this chapter is inevitably emotional and challenging — but as our class has done countless times over the years, in hardship, we see the bright side.
It would be impossible to write anything about the past few years, or the Class of 2022, without recognizing the losses and tragedies that we and the rest of the world have experienced. We have experienced Harvard and the world in a completely new way. While trying to keep up with the day-to-day of our newfound Zoom lives, we faced a global health crisis, a deep reckoning for racial justice after the murder of George Floyd and numerous other Black and brown people, heightened political polarization, and a toll on our mental well-being. It has been really hard for all of us in one way or another. These challenges — some unimaginable and some all too foreseeable — touched each of us differently; some have been a shared among the Class, and in some have been borne in isolation.
But we have not allowed these dark moments to define our college experience. If this year’s return to campus — being thrust into senior year as leaders on campus when we left as mere sophomores — has taught us anything, it is that we as a class are capable of far more perseverance than we realized. Despite nearly a year and a half off of the field, we have returned triumphantly for our senior seasons and led our teams to NCAA championships. Despite not being able to rehearse together in person, and having to demonstrate immense flexibility and creativity to make virtual performances happen, we have helped bring the performing arts community at Harvard back to life. Despite the onslaught of tragedy and injustice that we’ve seen around the globe, often targeting already-vulnerable communities, cultural and advocacy organizations have worked tirelessly to ensure that causes both inside and outside of the Harvard community can be uplifted.
As we prepare to go our separate ways, it may seem as though even more challenge and uncertainty lie ahead of us. But we know that the Class of 2022 is going to take these challenges and uncertainties and transform them into opportunities for growth and flourishing. We have learned how to stay connected to one another in spite of distance, making us better equipped to maintain our relationships after college than perhaps any who have come before us. We have learned that opportunities and experiences are not to be taken for granted — a lesson that can help us live fully in the moment and make the most of whatever comes next. We have learned how to navigate our values, goals, and identities both inside and outside of the traditional college environment, preparing us to continue developing as rich and complex individuals outside of Harvard. We can’t wait to see who each of you will become, and the positive change that you’ll bring about.
We’ll be forever bonded together as a class full of grit and light. The ebbs and flows of the last few years prove it. As you exit this chapter and enter your next, we hope you will ask yourself: How can I push the world around me forward just a little bit each day? Then, take the tools and experiences that Harvard has given you and run with them! If we all find the answer to that question as often as we can, we will always be connected by the magic that we shared together and what we built with it.
It has been an immense honor for us to witness all of the strength, beauty, and love that this class has shared with one another and with the world. We have been and will continue to be inspired by each of you.
Love,
Menat and Ruth

British actress ​​Adjoa Andoh will address the Harvard College Class of 2021 at its in-person Class Day Dinner on May 28, the 2021 Class Committee announced in an email Tuesday.
Class Day, an annual tradition to celebrate Harvard College graduates, typically includes remarks from a featured speaker and College Dean Rakesh Khurana on the day before University-wide Commencement exercises. The Classes of 2020 and 2021 are set to have joint on-campus exercises after the University postponed their in-person Commencements due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Andoh, who is best known for her role as Lady Danbury in the television series “Bridgerton,” has also appeared in the long-running sci-fi show “Doctor Who” and the medical drama series “Casualty,” which has aired since 1986.
In addition to acting in television shows, Andoh has taken stage roles ​​with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre in England and starred in the 2009 movie “Invictus.”
Class Committee Secretary Devin B. Srivastava ’21 wrote in a statement that Andoh will address Harvard’s “first majority-minority class in its 380-year history” and referenced the University’s recent release of its landmark Legacy of Slavery report.
“Our class is graduating as Harvard just released a report on our institution’s complicity in slavery and announced $100 million dollars to fund a process of reckoning and repair,” wrote Srivastava, a former Crimson News editor. “As Harvard thinks about representation and storytelling, our class will uniquely benefit from hearing from an artist like Ms. Andoh who has been telling stories and representing others for her entire career.”
Second Marshal Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 wrote in a statement that the Class Committee is “ecstatic” for Andoh to speak at the Class Day Dinner and said her energy would “add another highlight” to in-person festivities.
“The Class of 2021 had requested someone who embodies the spirit, drive, and intellect of our class, and we believe we found these qualities in Adjoa, especially while watching her performances in the hit show Bridgerton,” Kumar wrote.
Last year, professional basketball player Jeremy Lin ’10 addressed the Class of 2021 virtually, calling on graduates to embrace their identities and life experiences post-graduation.
The 2021 Class Committee also recently announced that they would distribute “commemorative” non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, to members of the Class of 2021 during Commencement festivities.
Boston mayor Michelle Wu ’07 is set to address the Class of 2022 during its Class Day on May 25, while American actor Ashton Kutcher will speak to the Class of 2020 during their Class Day Dinner three days later.

PISCATAWAY, N. J. ––  On Sunday, May 15, the men's lacrosse team battled for the NCAA Tournament title for the first time since 2014. The bracket was historic in that six Ivy League teams were given bids, with five of them being seeded in the top eight teams of Division I. Harvard was the only non-seeded Ivy team, garnering an at-large bid on the merit of an impressive season for the Crimson. Harvard had its best league record in over a decade, going 3-3 against Ivy teams. It also earned wins over four ranked squads, its best outcome in over 15 years. Despite its successes, the Crimson’s inclusion in the NCAA Tournament bracket was not without controversy, with ESPN insider Paul Carcaterra intimating that the selection committee might have instead chosen to give an ACC team a nod.
“I thought the Ivy League proved to be the most competitive conference in college lacrosse. I did not see, prior to the selection show, six Ivy teams getting into the tournament. I projected five Ivy teams, with Notre Dame getting the last spot over Harvard,” Carcaterra told The Crimson. “I thought Harvard had a great year, but Notre Dame, in my opinion, with a better RPI, as well as the way they were playing later in the season, deserved that final spot. With that said, the future is very bright for Harvard, and [head] coach Gerry Byrne has laid down a tremendous foundation, one in which will make them competitive nationally for years to come.”
Lacrosse insiders and fans have become used to seeing ACC teams compete and win titles, leading to some surprise when neither Duke or Notre Dame was included in the bracket. Virginia was the only ACC team to make the tournament. The committee seemed to value a team’s Rating Percentage Index (RPI), which calculates through win and loss records, neutrality of the game, home field advantage versus being on the road, and other metrics how the teams should be ranked. By RPI standards, Harvard’s selection appeared to be a surprise; the Crimson ranked 15th in RPI, behind both Duke (7th) and Notre Dame (11th), who beat the Blue Devils twice and won its last six games of the season.
Harvard, despite not earning a spot in the four-team Ivy Tournament on May 6-8, was given a second chance at postseason glory. However, the young Crimson squad was unable to advance past the first round, falling to sixth-seeded Rutgers, 19-9.
“Though the season ended in the First Round of NCAA [tournament], it really is the first round of our development as a team and culture after being apart and away for over two years,” Byrne noted.
The team fought hard for all four quarters, but struggled to control possession, especially on the faceoffs. Faceoffs were a point of weakness on the day as the unit, even after getting the ball to a scrum, was unable to obtain possession. Losing initial clamps was common throughout the regular season, but the wings had excelled at claiming the loose balls; throughout the contest, the Scarlet Knights beat Harvard at its own game, and were able to capitalize on fast break opportunities, scoring several goals either by their FOGO off the initial clamp, or on unsettled opportunities.
“I thought our team continued to fight throughout the entire game,” said first-year midfielder Owen Gaffney, who scored two goals in the contest.“We never quit and we never gave up. We stayed together and tried to claw back. We didn’t get the result we wanted, but we showed resilience throughout the entirety of the game.”
Rutgers efficiently shared the ball, allowing its offense to take advantage of open players on the wings and in the middle. The Crimson defense did a nice job of communicating through the Scarlet Knights’ plays, and junior SSDM Chase Yager had an outstanding performance in his one-on-one play. Down low, first-year defenders Tommy Martinson and Collin Bergstrom worked well together, talking through picks and switches, and staying tight on their players. Overall, the unit had a tough time neutralizing two of Rutgers’ main threats, attackmen Scott Ross, who scored eight goals, and Scott Bartolo, who put up three goals and three assists. These two players were lethal both as individuals and also as facilitators on the attack, drawing doubles from Harvard’s defense and then taking advantage of late slide packages.
“We battled our hearts out. There’s plenty of things we wish we could go back and do a little bit better, but we’ve just got to tip our hats to Rutgers. They played great, and I think their experience showed,” noted senior midfielder Charlie Olmert, who served as one of the team’s captains this season. “I’m so proud of our team; I’m so proud of the way we fought. I’m so lucky and thankful to have been a part of this program.”
On the offensive end, the Crimson was methodical in picking apart the Rutgers defense, which succeeded at adapting to different types of Harvard sets. This patience resulted in the unit taking fewer shots than the Scarlet Knights, 36 to their 47, and this difference, coupled with Rutgers goalie Colin Kirst making 17 solid saves, resulted in the offense not scoring as quickly and confidently as it had in previous contests.
“We were feeling out how they were reacting to us, trying to do a lot of pick plays, and that was working for a little bit,” first-year attacker Sam King said. “Credit to their goalie, he made a lot of saves. We weren’t finishing as well as we wanted to.”
While the loss marked the end of the road for the team’s seniors – FOGO Kyle Massimilian, goalie Kyle Mullin, LSM Jake Hartje, attackman Austin Madronic, FOGO Steven Cuccurullo, and Olmert – the future is bright for the young squad, which boasted the most play time by freshman in all of Division I. The six seniors were leaders to the young group throughout the historic run, which King heavily emphasized after the loss.
“All the credit to the seniors for a great season,” he reflected. “All of it goes to them. Great leadership. They’re the best.”
The seniors made an impact on the program both tangibly on the field, and with their leadership off of the field, and each had comments on how the program shaped them and taught them lessons on camaraderie and teamwork..
“The collaboration of our first years and veterans that built this season will continue in the years to come as we pursue an Ivy League Title & a National Championship,” Byrne commented.
Cuccurullo was an impact player throughout his four years for the Crimson, leading the team with 61 ground balls in his first season and adding a goal and three assists, and 39 ground balls a goal and 4 caused turnovers his senior year.
“It was the journey of a lifetime to be on this team. I can’t thank my teammates enough for the entire experience,” he said. “The program is in great hands moving forward.”
Olmert has fostered a team dynamic of excellence both on and off the field. He was a Rhodes Scholar Finalist, finalist for the Senior CLASS Award, and overcame various injuries to see play time in every game his senior season.
“It’s been the privilege and honor of a lifetime to have been a member of the Harvard lacrosse team these past five years,” he said.
Mullin, who served as a co-captain alongside Olmert, saw action in all four of his seasons, starting his sophomore, junior, and senior years. He was an All-Ivy Honorable Mention selection his senior year, and had a standout performance in the team’s April 23 comeback win against Princeton with eight ground balls and 18 saves.
“Coming back as a fifth year was the best decision I’ve ever made. I will forever hold a special bond with this year’s team that means more to me than I could ever put into words,” Mullin said. “My classmates and I are awaiting graduation on an all but empty campus, and we are constantly reminded of an important lesson. Places are just places, it’s the people that make them special. I hope my teammates know that they meant the world to me, and I hope they remember me as someone who played with my heart every time I put on the jersey.”
Massimilian was an integral part of the face-off unit, working with Cuccurullo for their four seasons together to secure important possession time for the squad.
“Taking a year off to come back and play with this team was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made,” he said. “I am incredibly grateful to be part of this group of dedicated young men. Harvard lacrosse is a special family, and I have learned countless valuable lessons from my experience.”
Hartje, who also plays for the men’s ice hockey squad, helped the Crimson secure a Feb. 19 victory over New Jersey Institute of Technology, and helped to foster team spirit both on and off the field.
“Being a part of the Harvard lacrosse family was one of the best experiences of my life,” he said. “The friends I made and the community I got to be a part of are the most important pieces of my Harvard years. I am forever grateful for the time I had with these guys.”
Madronic established his crafty and dominant style of play on the offensive end early in his four-year career. He was an immediate boon to the squad as a two-time Ivy League Rookie of the Week his freshman year, and continued to develop his skills well into his senior year, where he finished with 30 goals and 14 assists.
“It’s been the honor of a lifetime being a part of this team and program,” Madronic added. “I can’t thank my teammates, coaches, and the rest of the Harvard lacrosse family enough.”
As he resets for next season, Byrne, who coached the seniors for one full season and two others affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, will have to continue to build his program without six culture-setters in the building. Together, the graduating seniors instilled values of grit, dedication and determination.
The coach was effusive with his praise: “The 2022 senior class of six young men who set a standard on the field and off will be remembered for their skill, mentorship and leadership.”

When I arrived on campus in 2018, I didn’t know a lot of things. I had an inkling about my concentration, but nothing set in stone, and I didn't know many other incoming freshmen. Extracurriculars also presented a question mark. At the club fair, I beelined to several different booths, signing up for more mailing lists than I could realistically check. Despite all the unknowns, however, there was one thing I did know: I loved sports. I started playing hockey when I was five, so I knew I wanted to play on the men’s club hockey team.
Beyond playing sports, though, I loved following and talking about sports. Every day before school, from about age seven until high school, I would park myself in front of the TV to watch SportsCenter as I ate breakfast. Each Monday morning after a long NFL slate, I would get into spirited debates with my classmates and teachers about the previous day’s games or the woes of the Washington Commanders. I consumed everything from ESPN’s afternoon studio programming to newspaper articles to podcasts.
Interestingly, I also found myself to be a decent writer, and I enjoyed it too. In high school, I wrote for my student newspaper, and by my senior year, I became one of the editors-in-chief. So when I got to Harvard, I knew that a student publication might be a good fit. After testing out different writing outlets including half of the comp process for a political publication, Crimson Sports was the only one that stuck and stood the test of time. It combined two of my deepest interests in a way that other extracurriculars on campus did not. While the dual interest is the reason I joined Crimson Sports, it’s not the reason I stayed. To this day, some of my best friends at Harvard come from Crimson Sports — and one of my proudest achievements is leading the organization as co-chair.
Events and outings are a big part of what makes the sports board great. I still remember losing in the board beer pong tournament back in September 2018 in heartbreaking fashion — we blew a lead worse than the Falcons’ 28-3 Super Bowl collapse. The BYOB Dok Bua outing in May 2019 was definitely a festive occasion, and it was a pleasure to run it back in May 2022. Joey Minatel and I took a legendary picture at Hong Kong in November 2019 to celebrate the beginning of our tenure as co-chairs, which later became the board’s GroupMe avatar. In September 2021, A.J. Dilts and I teamed up in Spikeball as “Team Chairs” at the Sports-Multimedia mixer, and then we teamed up again to take on “Team Comp Directors” in the comper scavenger hunt in December 2021.
Events are really only half the story, though. The daily interactions and sustained friendships are what make Crimson Sports such a special place. Running into Zing Gee or Lucy Connor in the Adams D-Hall to scheme up the next sports social. Reading a closeout email penned by the comedic minds of Noah Jun and Alex Wilson. Seeing live text updates from Griffin Wong on how long his football gamer is going to be (hint: long). Hearing Katharine Forst break down the ideal defensive scheme for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team. Bantering with Amir Mamdani in the GroupMe. And of course, I’ve got to shout out Jasper Goodman for road tripping to Dartmouth, collaborating on men’s hockey articles over Zoom during the dark days of Covid, and providing endless assists on page duty in the newsroom during the wee hours of the morning.
I love talking about sports, covering teams, and getting into debates as much as anyone else, and sure, that’s why I originally got into Crimson Sports. But as cliché as it sounds, the people are what kept me here. It’s crazy how something as small as a funny text in the sports GroupMe can brighten a tough day. During my time at Harvard, I’ve had the privilege to take a lot of cool classes, meet interesting people, and take part in fun extracurriculars. Nonetheless, my greatest achievement at Harvard isn’t necessarily the grades I’ve gotten or the accolades I’ve won — it’s being the chair of Crimson Sports and leading it through the Covid-19 pandemic. I became chair right before the pandemic, and during the virtual semesters, engagement was tough — after all, there were no games to cover. Community faltered and article production waned. To see how the board has rebounded to where it is today — with vibrant community, seamless production, and better diversity than the board has had in recent memory — I am truly proud. I hope that I played a role in this renewal, and I know the board is in incredible hands under the leadership of Alex Wilson, Griffin Wong, Zing Gee, and Noah Jun.

The ball was in the air for what felt like 30 seconds to Harvard junior quarterback Luke Emge. As Emge’s 3rd and 10 fade to the back left corner of the end zone at the Yale Bowl descended towards a leaping junior wide receiver Kym Wimberly, much hung in the balance. There were 22 seconds left in the 137th rendition of The Game, with Yale clinging to a 68-60-8 series edge and a 31-27 lead in the contest. 49,500 fans, half clad in crimson and the other half in navy blue, had descended upon New Haven, Conn., from all around the country.
For head coach Tim Murphy, a catch would mean his 20th victory in 28 tries against the Crimson’s archrivals. If it scored a touchdown, the team would finish with an 8-2 record, its best performance since 2015, when it went 9-1 to claim the Ivy League title. But if the football fell to the turf, Harvard would have to reset and go back to the line of scrimmage to draw up another play — on fourth down. A failure to score on that play would send throngs of Harvard fans returning to Cambridge in disappointment. Revenge would not be exacted for Yale’s 50-43 double overtime victory in 2019 at the same venue.
But Emge never let himself entertain the possibility of failure.
“I threw the ball having confidence he would come down with it,” he said of Wimberly.
Emge had reason to be confident. All season, the six-foot Wimberly had made play after play, hauling in 34 passes for 453 yards and four touchdowns to end the year as Harvard’s leading receiver. None was bigger than the twisting catch he made over the top of Bulldogs defensive backs Wande Owens and Dathan Hickey that Saturday.
As the Slidell, La., native came down in the back of the end zone, with Hickey crashing down on top of him, tens of thousands of Harvard fans screamed in exaltation. After a 60 minute back-and-forth battle that saw neither team hold more than a 10-point lead, the Crimson stood on the doorstep of victory.
“Initially, I couldn’t believe myself when I saw him make that catch,” said junior kicker Jonah Lipel, an All-Ivy First Team selection whose pair of first-half field goals were critical in helping Harvard to victory. “It was so filthy, right over the top of that defender.”
The win didn’t come easily for the Crimson, which had scored on five of its nine opening drives prior to the Yale contest. Instead, it got off to about the slowest possible start, with three false start penalties in the first four plays. Then, Harvard’s fifth-ranked defense allowed its opponent to score on its opening drive for the first time all season, as Bulldogs sophomore quarterback Nolan Grooms found senior wide receiver Darrion Carrington for a 17-yard score to give Yale a 7-0 lead. On the next possession, Emge was strip-sacked by junior defensive lineman Reid Nickerson deep in the Bulldogs’ red zone.
“It was crazy,” Wimberly recalled. “We [couldn’t] really hear. They were doing some weird snap counts. That is one of the few moments of the game that stuck out. To start off the game with three false starts is kind of like, ‘Man, we’ve gotta get going, boys.’ … It turned out pretty well.”
“Pretty well” would prove to be a modest way of describing the rest of the game, which turned out to be one of the most dramatic clashes in the 137-year history of the rivalry. The contest featured three lead changes, a blocked punt returned for a touchdown — the Crimson’s first since Oct. 5, 2019 against Howard — and saw Lipel set the program record for most field goals in a single season. He broke it on his first of two 47-yarders, which cut the deficit to 7-3 late in the first quarter. The 47 yards also marked his career long. He later smashed one through the uprights from the same distance on the opposite end of the field to give Harvard a 13-10 lead in the second quarter.
“As a kicker, I really just [have to] do my job when I’m called upon, no matter the situation,” Lipel said. “That warmup for Yale was probably one of the best warmups I’d had all season, my pregame, and I just felt amazing, and so walking up to both of those kicks I knew I was going to make them.”
The arc of the game largely mirrored the Crimson’s season: Harvard came out the gates firing, trouncing Georgetown, 44-9, in its opening appearance. It then maintained its hot form all the way up to an Oct. 23 clash at Princeton, when a timeout was granted to Tigers head coach Bob Surace after Wimberly had found the end zone, improperly negating what would have been the game-winning score in triple overtime (the Ivy League later acknowledged the officiating error). It fell in quintuple overtime and went on to lose to Dartmouth the following week at home.
Similarly, at the Yale Bowl, Lipel’s field goals and the measured play of Emge, junior running back Aaron Shampklin, and the Harvard defense helped the Crimson outpace its nemesis for most of the game. After Murphy’s squad gained the lead for the first time with 37 seconds left in the first quarter, Yale would not lead again until seven minutes, 48 seconds were left on the clock. Harvard was buoyed by unlikely heroes, like sophomore linebacker Kobe Joseph, a converted tight end who returned junior safety James Herring’s second blocked punt of the season for 35 yards and a wild score to extend the team’s edge to 20-10.
The Crimson’s lead did not last, however, as the Bulldogs, led by Grooms and junior running back Spencer Alston, systematically dissected the Crimson defense. Grooms and Alston consistently stepped up, with the signal-caller launching a 30-yard touchdown pass just before halftime that cut into the Harvard lead and the running back finding a hole up the middle of the field on a third-and-18 play early in the fourth quarter, keeping alive a drive that would ultimately result in the Bulldogs’ go-ahead score. The Crimson’s mid-game struggles were emblematic of its consecutive heartbreaking losses to the eventual Ivy League co-champions in late October.
“What resonates for me was the extreme and somewhat unlikely shifts in the game,” Murphy wrote in an email. “It was very exciting and unpredictable for the fans, coaches and TV audience.”
When Yale head coach Tony Reno, staked to a four-point lead, opted to punt on 4th and 1 from his own 35-yard line with just under three minutes remaining in the game, it seemed as if Harvard had one drive to produce a game-winning score. Thus, when Emge’s 4th and 6 pass to Wimberly was broken up, Harvard fans appeared visibly deflated. Seemingly the only people at the Yale Bowl not convinced of the hosts’ impending victory were Murphy and his team.
“Having been part of 28 [Harvard-Yale] games, you expect the unexpected,” wrote Murphy, the winningest head coach in Ivy League history. “Having been fortunate to have been part of 19 out of 27 Harvard-Yale victories, I never, ever feel like we are not going to win it.”
“Coming off the field, I remember [assistant head coach Joel Lamb ’93] just saying to me, ‘Hey, keep your helmet on, our defense is going to get a stop, we’re going to get the ball back,’” Emge added.
After three short rushes by Alston and Grooms, Reno was faced with a 4th and 8 from Harvard’s 34-yard line. Instead of punting, Reno opted to let Grooms attempt a hero play to ice Yale’s win. But amid suffocating pressure from Harvard’s front seven, the southpaw was forced to throw it away. The Crimson was left with just 59 seconds — and no timeouts — to orchestrate a 66-yard drive.
Weeks of practice had helped Harvard prepare for the moment.
“We are constantly running two-minute drills, repping it in practice, knowing what to do in the situation,” Emge said.
Of course, a season in which the Crimson rallied from defeats to the Tigers and the Big Green to conclude with victories in each of its final three games had to end on a comeback. In its final drive, as it had all season, Harvard received contributions from the top and bottom of its roster. It was Wimberly who made the catch on the third and 12. But a similarly valuable play was made by two less heralded players: sophomore safety Jelani Machen and first-year safety Garrett Sharp combined to tackle Pantelis on the ensuing return.
And, as the remaining seconds ticked off the clock, Harvard came together as a unified team — as a unified school — with the stands emptying to admit tens of thousands of fans onto the field. It marked a fitting culmination of not just a trying game but of a trying few years for the Crimson, which saw the 2020 season canceled due to Covid-19.
Amid the chaos stood Wimberly, looking for his parents. But instead of falling into their arms in exhilaration, the star wide receiver found his coach.
“I was looking for my mom and dad, and I remember standing on the bleacher, and then the first person I saw … was [Murphy],” Wimberly said. “I hopped off the bench and literally gave [Murphy] the biggest hug ever. I literally had him in the air.”
While it was Emge’s perfect pass and Wimberly’s tough catch that delivered a victory for the Crimson, none of it would have been possible without Murphy’s leadership. The wide receiver lifting his head coach in the air, screaming in jubilation as Harvard students surrounded the pair on the field, seems to perfectly encapsulate the most recent installment of a legendary rivalry.
In a capstone to its successful season, a battle-worn team, held together through unfailing trust, put the finishing touches on an instant classic. The 34-31 comeback victory over Yale will not soon be forgotten in Cambridge, thanks in large part to one wide receiver and his head coach, who, with an entire school rallying behind them, helped produce the most unlikely drive in one of the most unlikely seasons in Harvard football history.

On Nov. 20, 2021, the Harvard men’s cross country team traveled down to Tallahassee, Fla. for the NCAA National Championship. Entering the race ranked No. 25 in the country, the Crimson men ran their best race of the season, placing 12th ahead of many ranked opponents. This race was the capstone moment of a historic year for Harvard distance runners. Leading the charge for the Crimson throughout the year were senior Matthew Pereira and sophomore Acer Iverson.
When asked about his favorite moments from his Harvard running career so far, Iverson responded quickly:
“Proudest moment was definitely finishing 12th as a team at nationals for cross country,” he said. “Wrapping up our trio of All-Americans made it all the better.”
The Crimson were actually led on that day by freshman Graham Blanks, who placed 23rd. However, just behind Blanks finished Pereira in 35th and Iverson in 40th. All three runners were selected to the NCAA Division I All-American Team, which, as Pereira noted, was an honor only four teams in the country accomplished. For Pereira, this finish cemented his breakout senior season, bettering his finish in the 2019 NCAA championship by 30 spots.
“Performing at that meet is our primary focus of the entire season, so it felt like the previous two years of training had led up to it,” Pereira commented.
Pereira improved dramatically across his four years as a runner, a rarity in collegiate distance running, which is typically dominated by underclassmen and blue-chip talents. The Kildeer, Ill. native was not a scorer for the team as a freshman, placing 67th in the 2017 Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. By 2018, the then-sophomore was the fourth highest-scorer for the Crimson, placing 17th overall at Heps. As a junior, Pereira improved to be the third scorer, crossing the finish line in 12th on the way to a second-place team finish at Heps and an All-Ivy League Second Team nomination.
In his senior year, Pereira flipped a switch when Harvard traveled to the Nuttycombe Invitational in October. In the field of over 230 runners, Pereira paced all Crimson runners, placing 27th overall. By comparison, at the same race in 2019, he finished 200th. Two weeks later, Pereira won the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, becoming the school’s first individual champion since Kieran Tuntivate ’20 in 2018. At NCAA regionals, the Kildeer native placed fourth, helping Harvard qualify for the NCAA championships in back-to-back years.
In 2020, the suspension of athletics across campus due to the Covid-19 pandemic pushed Harvard distance runners to take more agency over their training. To support this effort, a group of approximately ten male and four female runners, including Pereira, moved out to Flagstaff, Ariz. to train at 7,000 feet and bond as a unit.
“During the early part of Covid, training was very isolated for a while and pretty difficult. Later in the pandemic, taking time off from school or remote learning gave a few of us on the team the unique chance to train in Flagstaff, which was a really fantastic experience as it’s basically a distance running mecca,” he said. “Flagstaff was beautiful, and the consistent high-mileage, hilly altitude training was a really big boost for fitness.”
Pereira also noted the importance of his durability during his college running career. In a sport where keeping your body in peak physical condition is critical, injuries can reduce training time and keep runners sidelined.
“I’ve been fortunate enough to not deal with any serious injuries in my time at Harvard, so for the past 3 years I’ve had the chance to string together a lot of great high-volume training blocks,” said Pereira when asked about his improvement over the years. “So the consistency of heavy training has been a big help, as was the spring in Flagstaff with challenging workouts and long run spots that made it easy to build fitness.”
Following his strong cross country season, Pereira continued to string together excellent performances in indoor and outdoor track and field. In the winter, he put up the 3rd best time in school history in the 5k and placed second in the 3k and 5k at indoor Heps. At the Payton Jordan Invitational, Pereira had his greatest individual moment yet, when he set a school and Ivy League record in the 10k with a blazing time of 27:45.77. The time, which was the second fastest in the NCAA East Region this year, broke both a 20-year old Ivy League mark held by Dartmouth’s Tom McArdle and Iverson’s Harvard record set earlier that winter. At outdoor Heps, Pereira crossed the line in second in the 10k, behind only Iverson. These performances have cemented him as one of the best distance runners in the nation.
Iverson has come into his own in the recent months. The Roseville, Minn. native began his Crimson career as a freshman in 2019, when he was well outside of the top five-scoring members of the team. After taking a year off during Covid-19 pandemic, Iverson also saw incredible growth as a runner.
“We were able to make the most of 2020-21 by taking a gap year. It allowed me to take on some internships I wouldn’t have been able to, while giving running my full attention,” Iverson noted. “We are seeing the results of the development that happened over the gap year.”
In the fall, Iverson was part of the trio of All-American runners that helped push Harvard to be one of the top programs in the country. At the cross country Heps, he finished in fourth place and at NCAA Regionals, Iverson finished in fifth, one second behind Pereira.
After his strong fall performance, he found another level during the winter track season. At the Boston University Valentine Invitational, Iverson ran the 5k in 13:32.31, breaking the Crimson record previously held by Maksim Korolev ’14 by ten seconds while also setting a new Ivy League standard in the process.
At indoor Heps, the Roseville native captured individual titles in the 3k and the 5k, with Pereira just behind in second place for both events. The sophomore’s 5k time of 13:42.88 was a meet record. In the spring, at the Raleigh Relays, Iverson finished the 10k in 28:24.56, which bested the previous record set by Olympian Kieran Tuntivate ’20. At the Payton Jordan Invitational two months later, Iverson set a school and Ivy League record in the 5k, besting a 26-year old Harvard record by over 15 seconds, which was previously held by Ian Carswell ’97. The performance was also enough to top the Ivy mark of 13:30.79, which Dartmouth’s Jim Sapienza set in 1985. In the 10k the same weekend, Pereira broke Iverson’s new school record in the 10k.
“Matt set a very impressive school record in the 10k this season,” noted Iverson on his goals going forward. “He’s raised the bar and redefined what it means to be a good runner at Harvard. I’ve got my eyes set on that 27:45.”
At outdoor Heps in the spring, Iverson continued his dominance in the Ivy League, capturing two more individual titles in the 5k and 10k and helping lead the Crimson to a second place finish and its best point total since 1983.
The Harvard cross country and track and field teams have come a long way in recent years, becoming a force not only in the Ivy League, but also in the NCAA as a whole. Both Iverson and Pereira are talented individual runners who are representative of the strength of the program across the board.
“Our training group is incredibly cohesive and talented this year,” Iverson commented. “We’ve been able to push each other harder than ever before. I think that’s the biggest key to the recent surge in success both individually and across the program.”
While Iverson has two more years of eligibility to run for the Crimson, Pereira will be graduating and moving on to different pursuits.
“After graduating, I’m going to work as a software engineer and probably take a break from serious running for a bit,” Pereira said. “I’ve loved my experience running competitively at Harvard, but I’m ready to see how things are with running playing a smaller role in my life. I think I’ll miss it pretty soon though, we’ll see.“
Despite graduating a decorated individual contributor like Pereira, the men’s distance team is in good hands. Iverson and Blanks represent a strong duo looking to build off their record-setting 2021 seasons, while junior captain David Melville and sophomore Ben Hartvigsen are two scorers returning for Harvard next year. With Ivy League coach of the year Alex Gibby at the helm, big things await Iverson and the rest of the distance running team.

The No. 14 Harvard men’s tennis team finished a stellar season in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on May 7, falling to Stanford in a close 4-3 match. The Crimson went undefeated in conference competition, securing its 30th Ivy League championship.
The team’s successful run in the 2021-22 season marked a triumphant return after being sidelined due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Like other sports teams, the start of the fall semester meant rebuilding the team environment and assessing players’ skills after a year and a half of essentially training independently. Harvard head coach Andrew Rueb ’95 said he encouraged players throughout the break in play.
“One of the keys to our success [this season] was just how well our team managed the Covid year off,” Rueb said. “They remained active, and they were still engaged as students, but they were also pushing their tennis games and finding ways to play, and compete, and stay sharp.”
The season started with a bang in September at the Milwaukee Tennis Classic, one of college tennis’ most prestigious tournaments. Sophomore Henry von der Schulenburg won the singles title, defeating USC’s Lodewijk Weststrate in the final in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2. Meanwhile, Harvard took second place in the doubles bracket with the pairing of von der Schulenburg and junior Harris Walker. The Crimson’s success in its first tournament helped build the team’s confidence moving forward.
“It was sort of a big splash from the start, and we realized, ‘Hey, this team can compete on a national level,’” Rueb said.
Indeed, Harvard proved that it could compete with the best teams in the country as the season progressed. The Crimson hosted No. 2 Florida, the defending NCAA champions, as well as Arizona State, No. 5 Michigan, and Cal Berkeley for Chowderfest. Von der Schulenburg once again took a spot in the final, this time claiming second place.
“That fall was when we really set the marker for what was possible,” Rueb said. “One event after the next, proving that we were playing top level competition and more than holding our own.”
Three players qualified for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Fall National Championship in San Diego. The doubles team of senior captain Brian Shi and freshman Daniel Milavsky lost in the Round of 16 to the University of Texas after a first-round win over the second-seeded team in the tournament, the Ohio State duo of Justin Boulais and James Trotter.
Harvard wasn’t discouraged by its fall in the ITA Championship in November, going on to achieve decisive 7-0 wins against Georgetown and Boston College in its first appearance of the spring. Throughout the fall season, captains Shi and junior Steven Sun, along with the coaching staff, fostered a strong team environment.
“Both captains did a great job of both leading by example but also building those connections and camaraderie,” Rueb said.
Shi had an impressive final season, with an overall singles record of 24-6 and a doubles record of 21-13. He went on a 13-match winning streak in singles and clinched the Ivy League Championship against Yale. Shi and Milavsky proved an effective doubles team, securing vital points for Harvard as the top seeds.
“[Brian] has come to embody what Harvard tennis is all about: he’s a great student, he’s a great ambassador, and a beautiful player,” Rueb said of the graduating senior. “It’s been a joy to watch him compete and play at the highest levels of college tennis.”
The heart of the spring season began with the ITA Kickoff in California, where the Crimson faced off against No. 26 Pepperdine, No. 13 USC, and No. 5 Michigan. Despite injuries over winter break and the tough adjustment to outdoor play after a long indoor season, Harvard made a strong showing. The nail-biting match against Pepperdine came down to Shi, whose stunning 6-7(4), 7-5, 6-4 victory brought the final score to 4-3.
“We had two days of outdoor practice before playing one of the most storied programs in college tennis history, and we won 4-3,” Rueb recalled. “This gave us a lot of confidence.”
The Crimson carried that momentum forward and managed to clinch a similarly intense win against Michigan, 4-3, at home. Walker closed out the match as his teammates and the Murr Center crowd supported him. His clutch individual display, in a singles match that determined the team’s overall match result, exemplified the team’s camaraderie and grit.
Harvard was a force to be reckoned with for the remainder of the season. In February, the team defeated Columbia to win the Eastern College Athletic Conference Men’s Tennis Indoor Championship. The Crimson stood with an 11-4 record moving into Ivy League play, the last portion of the regular season. The conference was incredibly competitive — four teams and seven individuals from the Ivy League went to NCAAs this year, a record for men’s tennis — but it proved no match for Harvard. The team’s level of play only increased as the season went on.
“One of the things I was most proud of as a coach was I thought everyone was playing their best tennis at the end of the year, and I think that’s a testament to the resiliency and growth mindset that our players and students have,” Rueb reflected after the season.
The Crimson was undefeated against Ivy League teams, its first sweep of the conference since 2008. Harvard also won the doubles point in all six competitions. The team’s strong performance to end the season highlighted its growth over the course of the year.
While its loss to Stanford eliminated the Crimson from the NCAA team competition, the singles and doubles tournaments still remain. Von der Schulenburg, who went 24-8 this season, and Walker, who went 26-7, will compete in the singles draw starting in late May.
“It was clear at the beginning of the season that the top of our lineup was sharp, but the 4, 5, and 6 started out a little slower, and to see where they finished and how far they’d come was what makes our jobs [as coaches] so great,” Rueb said.
All in all, the 2021-22 season was a triumphant return to college tennis for Harvard, and the players are ready to take their success further next season. Von der Schulenburg and Walker will serve as captains, working alongside the coaching staff to set up goals for the team’s performance. Rueb has his sights set on the National Indoor Championships, for which the Crimson has never qualified.
“We want to build on what the team did this year and see if we can’t make another jump on the national level,” Rueb said. “There’s more to be done, and I think [the players are] working hard to get that and meet those challenges.”

A quick glance at the roster of the 2022 women’s College Squash Association national champions, the Harvard Crimson, will make one thing clear: Harvard is a trove for squash talent. Resumes include national championships, World Junior victories, Pan-American Games appearances, and more.
Delving deeper into the player biographies, one cannot help but ignore the outstanding representation of Egyptian athletes on the Crimson’s roster. Graduating seniors Hana Moataz and Amina Yousry, who have been foundational to Harvard’s success in the past four years, both hail from Cairo, Egypt. Fellow Cairo native Habiba Eldafrawy joined the pair this year as part of the 2021 rookie class.
The three played critical roles in the Crimson’s dominant campaign this past season, with Moataz leading the charge as co-captain and competing as the team’s number one. The veteran Yousry predominantly battled in position number three, though had some skirmishes at one and two. Eldafrawy dueled in the fourth position and even earned the green-light to play as high as the second position, an impressive feat as a first-year athlete. Through their contributions, the Egyptian stars have made themselves a core element of Harvard squash’s identity.
Egypt’s strength in the sport is not exclusive to college squash. The current world squash rankings in the men’s division features three Egyptians in the top five. The women’s podium in the Professional Squash Association world rankings is fully swept by Egyptian athletes. In the past decade, Egypt has established itself as the premier country for squash excellence, producing multiple top-ranked players in the professional league.
“I believe that having so many Egyptian players dominating the top of the world rankings makes the juniors believe that they also can make it to the top one day. I think that getting to watch the top players practicing in front of you inspires you to take the same route as them and excel in the sport just like they did,” Eldafrawy said of Egyptian success in squash. “It’s easier to make it to the top when you see someone living in the same environment as you making it to the top.”
The traditional route to the professional circuit for the top-ranked players in Egypt often bypasses college altogether in order to make time for the intensive training regime needed to perform at the highest level.
“The squash culture in Egypt is really different than in the US,” Eldafrawy said. “Back home, practice was a huge part of my day, even in the summer. I would have one-on-ones with my coach four out of five days a week on top of practice matches as well as fitness sessions. So I would say that college squash is way lighter in terms of practice. This is because college squash gives you the opportunity to play an individual sport in a team environment. This isn’t a thing in Egypt. You mainly play for yourself.”
In recent years, though, college squash recruiting has extended its reach into Egypt, as the CSA hopes to attract some of the best junior talent in the world to a more team-based game. Harvard has a storied and successful history of recruiting squash talent from the northeast African republic. Its program landed its first major recruit in 2012, when it was announced that Ali Farag ’14, then world No. 1 in the World Junior division, would be joining the men’s program at Harvard. Farag has gone pro and managed to climb his way up to world No. 1 in the PSA since his graduation from Harvard. He is a two-time world champion, and in 2017, he and his wife, Nour el-Tayeb, became the first married couple to win the same major title on the same day when they both claimed the US Open.
Farag’s successes for the Crimson helped open the gate for Egyptian recruitment in the United States while simultaneously demonstrating the viability of college squash as a pathway onto the professional circuit.
Moataz is seeking to follow a similar path. Even before graduating college, Moataz has been making waves on the professional circuit. In addition to her CSA accolades, the squash phenom has made multiple PSA finals appearances, including winning two PSA World Tour events, carrying her to a current world No. 49 ranking at the age of 22. She has also helped Harvard’s recruitment efforts in her home country; Eldafrawy partially credits Motaz and Yousry and the legacy of Egyptians in the Harvard squash program with her commitment to the school, citing the significance of being teammates with fellow nationals.
“I chose Harvard for two reasons,” she said. “One was because there were fellow Egyptians on the team … I just felt more comfortable going to a place where people I knew of were already excelling in academics as well as squash. The second reason [for attending Harvard] was that the Harvard women’s team is the best in the country.”
Harvard is a dynasty, embarking on a run of success unparalleled in college squash. The Crimson’s seven straight national titles make the team appealing to any athlete. As Egyptian success nurtures more Egyptian talent, Harvard has been at the forefront of college squash for years now and has manufactured a positive feedback loop for recruitment. It seems that the more stars the Crimson can acquire, the more renowned its program becomes, consequentially attracting more talent to the school.
Head coach Mike Way, alongside the rest of the coaching and recruitment staff, must be given due credit for building such a well-known program and actively pursuing talent worldwide. Eldafrawy explained that she was first drawn to the Crimson by head of recruitment, Luke Hammond, at the 2020 British Junior Open.
The 2021-22 squash season has exemplified the importance of the Egyptian squash tradition for Harvard’s success. As the school furthers its recruiting efforts in Cairo, it would be no surprise to see more Egyptian athletes added to the Crimson’s roster in the coming years.

If this Year in Sports has taught us anything, it is that Harvard athletes are resilient.
This academic year brought the first normal competition since 2020, and we have the honor of showcasing Harvard’s triumphant return to action. Since March 10, 2020, the day that athletics paused due to the Covid-19 pandemic, athletes and teams have endured canceled seasons, solo practices, and constant hits to team morale.
Nonetheless, the Crimson returned to the field, court, pitch, and pool with energy and force, proving this year to be one of resilience. For Harvard fans, it was worth the wait. The two years of perseverance culminated in eight conference championship wins, 17 NCAA appearances, three national championship wins, and individual standouts.
Here at Crimson Sports, we have had the opportunity to chronicle it all.
Throughout the past two years, we all have made sacrifices, as we change our daily routines and deal with our newfound realities. Harvard athletes have had to deal with all the challenges that we have off the field, all the while adjusting to a fundamentally different sports landscape and preparing for a return to intense competition. The determination and perseverance that they have displayed cannot be understated.
This Year in Sports hopes to encapsulate our athletes’ incredible efforts in elevating Harvard athletics despite adversity and proving that, indeed, Crimson sports – and Crimson Sports – is back.

In her 40 years as the Harvard women’s basketball coach, Kathy Delaney-Smith has overcome countless obstacles. She took over a program which had never had a full-time head coach – the two previous coaches split their time with tennis and lacrosse, respectively – and had won just 12 games the previous two seasons, and turned it into a league powerhouse within four years. In 1998, she led Harvard to a first-round victory over top-seeded Stanford in the NCAA tournament, the first 16-over-1 upset in college basketball history. In 2000, she coached while undergoing treatment for breast cancer.
While Delaney-Smith announced in November that she would retire after the 2021-2022 season, this year would not be a gentle farewell tour. With a significantly undersized team and a starting five that had just five years of Harvard basketball between them, Delaney-Smith had to face one of her biggest challenges as a coach.
When people in the Ivy League basketball community discuss Delaney-Smith, the “GOAT,” or “greatest of all time,” label comes up often. Coming into this year, she already held by a wide margin the record for most wins of any coach, men’s or women’s, in the Ancient Eight. Leading her young squad to the Ivy League Tournament added yet another chapter to her remarkable legacy.
Despite the difficult journey this season posed, Delaney-Smith was perfectly equipped to overcome it.
“She’s had lots of experience with different types of teams,” junior guard Maggie McCarthy explained. “She is a great leader. She let us be role models for each other, giving the players a good leadership role.”
This experience came in handy, particularly in a Jan. 29 contest against Penn. Harvard fell down by as much as 13 points late in the third quarter, but the team remained composed, outscoring Penn 36-19 for the remainder of the game to win, 70-63. It marked the third of a five-game winning streak.
However, the team hit a slump shortly after, losing three consecutive games, all by single digits. The season was on the brink, but the Crimson responded with one of its best performances of the season, an 85-52 thrashing against Dartmouth to clinch a spot in the Ivy League Tournament.
For McCarthy, the key to the team’s success was the unique culture Coach Delaney-Smith has built. Throughout her remarkable career, she has consistently preached team unity.
“We had one of the best team cultures that I’ve ever been a part of,” McCarthy said. “We had no off-the-court drama, everyone got along really well on and off the court…We had this ‘refuse to lose’ mentality for Kathy. We stuck together through [everything].”
After dropping its final regular season game to a league-leading and nationally-ranked Princeton squad at home, the Crimson yet again regrouped and rebounded for their legendary head coach. Facing the same Tigers team before a packed Lavietes Pavilion in the postseason conference tournament, Harvard played with a tenacious energy and trailed their opponent by only three points at halftime.
The defensive effort of McCarthy, senior guard Tess Sussman, and the entire Crimson team was on full display, as was the elite shot-making ability of first-year guard Harmoni Turner and junior guard McKenzie Forbes. Forbes, in particular, converted an and-one layup on a fastbreak and notched a pair of free throws to tie the game with six minutes remaining. Although clutch shooting from Princeton, which advanced to the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament later in March, was enough to oust Harvard at the final buzzer, the Crimson’s miraculous turnaround from the previous week brought an optimistic note to Delaney-Smith’s final moments at the helm.
“I know she’d want to leave with an Ivy championship, but she’s left the program in a great place,” said McCarthy. “We fought through a lot this year and stuck together through it all. I think that our record didn’t reflect how successful this season was and I think Kathy would say the same. She’s set up a great team for Coach [Carrie] Moore to take over [next season]. She created this basketball culture and this community of women, setting the foundation for our future growth.”
Delaney-Smith amassed 630 victories, won 11 Ivy League championships, and led Harvard to six NCAA Tournament appearances. Yet her most enduring legacy is found in the family she built through the Crimson women’s basketball program. With selflessness, courage, and her endearing sense of humor, Delaney-Smith has inspired countless players past, present, and future to play the game she loves.
Each home game this season, dozens of young girls watched Delaney-Smith lead her team from the sideline. Scores of former players returned to campus to honor her at “KDS Day” this past February, each wearing t-shirts with her mantra, “Act as If,” on the back. To Delaney-Smith, this maxim means to overcome the adversity and obstacles in the way of our goals by simply convincing ourselves they are surmountable. Let that be one final lesson the legendary Harvard women’s basketball coach can teach us all.

Perhaps no Harvard male athlete has seen more success in 2021-22 than former Harvard men’s ice hockey captain Nick Abruzzese, whose whirlwind season included playing for the U.S. Olympic team, winning an ECAC championship, and signing his first professional contract.
Abruzzese, a native of Slate Hill, N.Y., began his career in the North Jersey Avalanche youth program before joining the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League, the highest level of junior hockey in the U.S. With the Steel, he recorded 116 points (42 goals, 74 points) in 118 games over two seasons, eventually being named an alternate captain. In June 2019, Abruzzese was selected in the fourth round — 124th overall — by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft.
Abruzzese quickly rewarded the Maple Leafs’ selection with an outstanding first season at Harvard in 2019-2020, notching 44 points (14 goals, 30 assists) in 31 games. After the season, he was named the ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year while earning spots on the All-ECAC Hockey First Team and the ECAC All-Rookie Team.
Upon the Crimson’s return to play in 2021-22, Abruzzese was voted a team captain by his teammates, and he continued his collegiate career with a strong junior season, tallying 33 points (nine goals, 24 assists) en route to being named Ivy League Player of the Year, earning another berth on the All-ECAC Hockey First Team, and being named a First-Team All-American.
“At Harvard, the captains are elected by their peers, the other players on the team. I think it speaks to how others on the team felt about Nick as a leader and his character,” Harvard head coach Ted Donato said earlier this season. “We are very appreciative of the level of leadership and character that Nick brought every day into the program…having two classes of kids that haven't played at the collegiate level. For us, I thought Nick, along with [co-captain senior forward] Casey Dornach, did an incredible job unifying the group and I thought Nick's leadership was essential to the team's success.”
Midway through his junior season in Cambridge, Abruzzese and teammate sophomore forward Sean Farrell were selected to play on Team USA at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics after the NHL declined to allow its players to participate. Abruzzese recorded four points (one goal, three assists) in four games at the Olympic Games before the U.S. was eliminated by Slovakia in the tournament’s knockout round.
Abruzzese returned from the Olympics to play in the Crimson’s final two home games of the season, helping spur the team to a 4-3 win over Princeton on Feb. 18 and a 1-0 defeat of the No. 4 Quinnipiac Bobcats on Senior Night the following evening. Those victories secured a first-round bye and first-round home ice advantage in the ECAC postseason tournament, the first time Harvard was able to participate since prior to the pandemic.
In the first round of the ECAC playoffs against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Abruzzese recorded three points (one goal, two assists) to guide the Crimson to a thrilling 2-1 series victory to move on to the semifinals. In Game 1, Harvard erased a 3-0 deficit in the final two minutes of the game, with Abruzzese assisting on first-year forward Matthew Coronato’s game-tying goal with 15 seconds to play in regulation. The Crimson would ultimately go on to win the game in overtime. After dropping Game 2 to the Engineers, 4-3, in double overtime, Abruzzese recorded an assist on another Coronato goal that secured a 3-1 Game 3 victory for the Crimson, which sent it to the ECAC semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y.
Abruzzese was dominant in Harvard’s 5-3 semifinal victory over the Clarkson Golden Knights, recording two goals and two assists to lead the Crimson into the championship game. After assisting on Farrell’s opening goal midway through the first period, Abruzzese put the Crimson on top 2-1 midway through the second period when he batted a loose puck out of the air and into the net after a shot by first-year defenseman Ian Moore.
Despite facing a 3-2 deficit entering the third period, Abruzzese and his linemates took over the game, as the co-captain tied the game at 3-3 by jamming in a rebound before making a spinning backhand pass to assist Coronato on the go-ahead goal to put Harvard up for good. In the ECAC title game the next day, Abruzzese’s line continued to click, producing a goal to put the Crimson up 2-1 in the second period and later connecting on Coronato’s overtime winner to secure the Whitelaw Cup and an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.
In the Crimson’s NCAA tournament game against Minnesota State, Harvard was faced with an early 3-0 deficit before Abruzzese’s line again connected to cut the deficit to 3-1 and energize the Crimson offense. First-year forward Alex Gaffney would score just seconds later to cut the deficit to 3-2. Despite later facing a 4-2 deficit in the third period, Harvard again responded with a goal, but a furious comeback attempt in the final seconds fell just short and the Crimson were eliminated from the tournament with the 4-3 loss.
“They were doing a good job of getting in lanes,” Abruzzese said after the game. “They didn’t make it easy on us all night and the last 20 seconds was kind of a microcosm of that.”
It would prove to be his final appearance in a Harvard uniform, for his strong performance earned him the opportunity to take his talents to the next level. Days after the tournament loss, the Maple Leafs announced that they had signed Abruzzese to a two-year entry level contract worth $850,000 per season. He made his NHL debut for Toronto on April 4 at home against the Philadelphia Flyers, where he played just over nine minutes on 15 shifts. He recorded his first NHL goal against the Boston Bruins in Toronto’s final regular season game of the year when he deflected Maple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly’s shot past Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman.
“Nick's getting a chance to utilize his talents and his hard work and dedication to live out his dream,” said Donato after Abruzzese’s contract was announced. “It's exciting for us as coaches, it's exciting for his fellow teammates, and we certainly are really wishing him the very best.”
