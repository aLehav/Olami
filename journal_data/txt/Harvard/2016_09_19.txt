After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the course of the year, many Facebook users have found their newsfeeds transformed from colorful ecosystems of photo albums, news articles, and videos into what resembles iceberg-ridden seascapes of white-framed memes.
A meme is, according to Oxford Dictionaries, an “image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by Internet users, often with slight variations.” The memes on Facebook run the gamut. There are plain, black sans serif sentences on white backgrounds: “Always remember you’re someone’s reason to smile. Because you’re a joke”; “At this point my blood is probably 55% pasta sauce.” There are text-photo combinations—sometimes captioned photos, such as the notorious Arthur memes, and sometimes text spastically laid over the picture in the style of the “Doge” meme. There are video variations: “When reality hits you out from out of nowhere,” its point brought home by a video of a missile-like soccer ball striking a toddler to the ground. Some prompt the user to tag their friends in the comments, either seriously or as a snarky meta reference to meme culture itself: “Tag your favorite redhead”; “Tag someone so they have to open their phone and look at this pickle.” They are all processable in several seconds and typically encompass trite, “first world” issues.
Judging from their metastasis on many individuals’ newsfeeds, these “trashy” memes actually seem to be providing content users are at least amused—or even actively glad—to see. It has become standard for people to tag friends who remind them of memes’ (usually unflattering) scenarios, habits, or character traits. Facebook’s algorithm then shows the post in other friends’ newsfeeds, further spreading the plague.
The rise of the meme may be symptomatic of Facebook’s ongoing transformation—or perhaps its decline, despite what the company insists. Though still actively used by 1.6 billion people, the platform must contend with Snapchat and Instagram as a venue for personal sharing, and it also seems to be vacillating about its niche as it continues to roll out new features like Live Stream and Payments. Facebook has experienced a 21 percent decrease in personal sharing overall since its peak, with a 5.5 percent drop from mid-2014 to mid-2015 alone. In the vacuum, perhaps, we will accept even these mildly amusing, mind-numbing memes.
Memes as a whole could simply reflect the vapidity and shallowness of our Internet-driven society. We overwhelmingly process information in bits and bytes rather than chapters and volumes; this shift in media, as Nicholas Carr noted in “The Shallows,” may be catalyzing a corresponding shift in our brains. In an endless feedback loop of form and content, we use more ephemeral and spastic media than our predecessors, think less deeply as a consequence, then use even more ephemeral and spastic media to match our thoughts, etc. Unlike a long article or book, the meme instantly releases us to the next point of interest, and we never reflect deeply enough to amend the mocked behaviors. “Oh, binge drinking is so messed up,” we chortle, tagging a friend in a drinking-related meme before going out for a long night of shots. Instant gratification arrives in the form of likes and comments. Rinse and repeat.
There may, however, be a more charitable way to interpret memes. An irreverent irony underlies their inconsequentiality: When we find a meme amusing, we are laughing both at the pithiness with which a relatable situation has been captured and at the absurdity of relating to that situation at all. Memes also obliquely confront young adulthood, in which everything feels hostile and hilarious and obscene and unreal. The flippant formatting and phrasing provides a low-stakes public forum for topics like alcohol culture; the bizarreness of dating in the age of overwhelming communication; the bizarreness of relationships in general; the absurdity of coming of age; and all of our repressed, flawed, and human tendencies. The Facebook comments section in particular, in which one can see thousands of other users interacting with the post, grants a sense of camaraderie.
So maybe memes don’t signify a general collapse of the intellect. Perhaps they are simply the forum through which we, the generation living the most public lives in human history, in one of the most fast-paced and mind-boggling eras in human history, can quickly and self-deprecatingly air our dirty laundry together. We laugh at our dysfunctions and their stupidity; laugh at how many other people are just as dumb and messed up as we are. And then, amused and soothed, we move on with our lives.

To the Editor:
The Crimson quoted Walter C. Willett, current chair of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Nutrition Department in its coverage of our paper, “Sugar Industry and Coronary Heart Disease Research: A Historical Analysis of Internal Industry Documents,” published in JAMA Internal Medicine. We documented how the sugar industry enlisted three Harvard nutrition scientists in the 1960s to prepare a review published in the New England Journal of Medicine that downplayed emerging evidence linking sucrose with coronary heart disease and concluded there was “no doubt” that the only dietary intervention required to prevent coronary heart disease was to reduce dietary cholesterol and substitute polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat in the American diet. Willett said that the episode brought to light the dangers of industry funding, and that, “Both [the sugar and fat] sides were on the right track in the 1960’s publication, and it is clear that the causes of cardiovascular disease, and most major health problems, are multi-dimensional.”
We agree.
We disagree, however, with his statement that, “[Our] paper tried to portray it as one or the other, one-dimensional thinking for not a one-dimensional problem.”
It was the Harvard authors of the 1967 review, not us, who imposed one-dimensional thinking on the complex problem of dietary risk factors in heart disease. With funding from the sugar industry, they claimed that reducing the fat and cholesterol content of the American diet was the only dietary change necessary to prevent and control coronary heart disease, rather than changes to the fat, cholesterol, and sugar content of the diet.
Sincerely,

Rubbernecking: the act of slowing down in a moment of morbid curiosity or harmless fascination. The phrase was originally coined in the early 20th century to refer to tourists who slow down the normal pace of things because of their fascination with a new environment (looking at you, John Harvard statute tourists). Synonyms include: curiosity delay, gaper delay, gawk block, and Lookie Lou.
We’ve all been there. An accident on the side of the road causes traffic delays, a four-lane highway is bottlenecked, and cars and trucks have to merge left to avoid the three-car pile up surrounded by law enforcement and emergency responders. Onlookers resolute to identify the cause of the accident (and figure out what precisely caused their 40 minute delay) exacerbate the already slow moving traffic. Is anyone hurt? Whose fault is it? How bad do the cars look?
At a fundamental level, rubbernecking is part of human nature. There is a body of scientific evidence suggesting that the physiological reaction we have to being scared or repulsed is similar to the reaction we have when we’re excited. When we slow down to observe a wreck, we do so because we find the wreck fascinating and our behavior easy to justify: Everyone else has slowed down to pay attention to the wreck; I guess I should take a look too.
But unfortunately, rubbernecking is likely to cause more accidents and slowdowns. According to a 2013 study, rubbernecking caused by vehicle crashes and other incidents accounted for 16 percent of all vehicle crashes, amounting to more congestion and more accidents.
The good, and bad, news about rubbernecking is that it’s entirely in control of the onlookers. Fellow drivers can choose to slow down as the car in front of them does, but they can also choose to keep driving at a normal pace.
Which brings me to my point, and my plea: Please do not rubberneck your way through the 2016 election.
It’s tempting. When Hillary Clinton “whips and nae naes” on the Ellen Show, or Donald Trump seemingly removes a baby from his rally, it can be hard not to succumb to the click bait and revel in the absolute absurdity that is the 2016 presidential election.
But the consequences of focusing on the unimportant can be drastic. An analysis featured by the New York Times attempted to track the amount of airtime, understood succinctly as earned or “free” media, each candidate received throughout the primary election. Whether or not that media attention was truly “earned” is a debate for another time, but I’d argue the massively disproportionate coverage of some candidates over others is in part a product of political rubbernecking.
Each outrageous statement made (or tweeted) by Donald Trump has perpetuated his coverage. Each new “Trump gaffe” (which somehow never gives rise to any of the political symptoms usually associated with a gaffe, like a drop in the polls) just drives more media attention his way. And the more that rubbernecking drives attention toward Donald Trump, the more that Hillary Clinton is able to skimp on her own exposure in the media. Secretary Clinton avoided giving a press conference for 275 days until breaking her streak last week.
While the press has been repeating awkward incidents by candidates to fulfill the public’s appetite and focusing on the competitive, “who is up and who is down” nature of campaigns, substance has fallen to the wayside. In a study conducted about the 2016 presidential primaries by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center, it was determined that only a paltry 11 percent of all primary coverage focused on a candidate’s policy positions, leadership ability, or personal and professional history.
Political rubbernecking is not new to media coverage, but it definitely seems intensified this time around. I don’t argue that every outrageous and seemingly irrelevant statement (or tweet) made by presidential contenders should be ignored. But I do know that the press reports on what the public reads, and there is a serious need to press both candidates on their respective policy positions.
A recent evaluation of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump’s campaign websites reveals exactly how much substantive policy is (or isn’t) being addressed: the Clinton site details a total of 112,735 words dedicated to 38 policy issues, and the Trump site lists a total of seven policy issues amounting to just over 9,000 words.
This discrepancy feels strange. As a country, we have to consider what factors should be most central to our decision to elect a new president, and in turn we need to hold our nominees responsible for delivering relevant information. As we get closer to Election Day, let’s start having real conversations. Or at least stop rubbernecking the sillier ones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent op-ed that appeared in The Crimson about a sexual assault (“It’s Me, One of Your Statistics”) was a painful reminder that there is still work to be done in our effort to tackle sexual assault. It is critical to ensure that all people receive the support they need following such an incident. Our procedures fell short and we are deeply sorry.
When a person seeks care through Harvard University Health Services after reporting a sexual assault, there are procedures in place to engage the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response to provide support, ensuring the individual is aware of all the resources available, including evidence collection often referred to as a "rape kit." Harvard does not perform evidence collection but, as with most universities in the Boston area, we work with local hospitals that contract with Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners who administer these kits with special training and expertise. OSAPR advocates and/or officers from the Harvard University Police Department are available to take people to a hospital for evidence collection and related medical care. More information about evidence collection and SANE sites can be found on the mass.gov website.
These procedures were not followed in this instance. We do not want anyone to be in the position of having to find their own transportation to a hospital to have evidence collected, and we do not want anyone to be made to feel that the University is powerless to help with an experience they find traumatic.
HUHS is committed to an ongoing evaluation of its services and to learning how and where it can make improvements to its procedures to prevent situations as described in the recent op-ed from happening. HUHS is working to increase the frequency of training for its staff to clarify procedures and ensure that everyone seeking care at HUHS has a consistent experience. People deserve to know their options, their rights, and feel supported in the resulting decisions they make for themselves. As we work to improve education and communication initiatives about our services, we welcome the invaluable feedback of community members.
Additionally, we recognize that the prospect of participating in a complaint investigation may seem overwhelming. Over the past two years, the Office for Dispute Resolution has been investigating complaints regarding sexual harassment, including assault. Acting as a neutral entity, the office seeks to determine if policy violations have occurred. This requires investigators to be as thorough as possible, and while the average time of investigations has been cut from six months to four months, we continue to work to make the process move along more quickly while maintaining the same quality, fairness, and sensitivity.
We want to emphasize that filing a complaint with ODR is one of many choices available. Whether to file a complaint with ODR, HUPD, or both, for example, is a person’s choice. Many people choose to work with their School’s Title IX coordinator to take advantage of personalized interim measures, such as adjustments to housing, academic, or workplace arrangements, to help them feel safer on campus, regardless of whether a complaint is ever filed. Interim measures may be put in place at any time and modified to meet the individual’s evolving needs.
Over the past few years, Harvard has advanced efforts to more effectively prevent and respond to sexual assault. In 2014, the University introduced a new sexual harassment policy and launched a new office to professionally investigate complaints; every Harvard School and unit now has designated Title IX coordinators to provide prompt assistance to all community members; resources for OSAPR have doubled; a task force of students, faculty, and staff convened to recommend more effective prevention methods; and a centralized web portal (share.harvard.edu) was launched to connect people to resources. Still, there is more work to be done.
As community resources, we will work to improve coordination, expand educational programs and training, and raise awareness about available on- and off-campus options. The values and aspirations of our community demand our commitment to doing better. We will.

Paul J. Barreira, MD, is Director of the Harvard University Health Services. Alicia Oeser is the Director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response. Mia Karvonides is Harvard University’s Title IX Officer and the Director of the Office for Dispute Resolution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent email sent by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana brought welcome news for the University’s fight against sexual assault. In addition to the in-person sexual assault trainings required of incoming freshmen during Opening Days, the College has introduced a new online sexual assault training module that all undergraduates must complete by mid-October.
The training module, which includes a quiz that students must complete at the end, is intended to provide students with information about the College’s policies and the resources it offers to deal with sexual and gender-based harassment. Given the oft-opaque nature of these issues, steps to increase clarity are critical.
We have long called for the University to increase the sexual assault training it provides to students. While in-person training is obviously preferable to an online program, getting this information to students should be the main priority. Critically, the College Title IX coordinators who speak frequently throughout the module emphasize this point when discussing how this new initiative works in tandem with the College’s other efforts.
Though sexual assault is the issue most frequently discussed in this area, the module provides a necessary reminder that Title IX policy also covers other instances of sexual or gender based harassment.
Even as Harvard has taken many commendable steps to ensure students understand what resources are available to them on campus, it is impossible to escape the reality that the issue of sexual assault and the procedures surrounding it are complicated, and understanding them requires more than just one training. When new policies were announced last spring, they were accompanied by complicated flow charts and long documents. This additional online module that students must complete each year represents a substantial step forward.
For survivors of sexual assault at Harvard, the aftermath is both devastating and difficult to navigate. An op-ed recently published in these pages addressed the traumatic experiences of one student who was sexually assaulted on campus. If this new training program is able to prevent even one sexual assault, then it unequivocally will have been worth the 30 minutes required for each student to complete it.
Going forward, administrators should use this initiative as an example of an improved policy on sexual assault. While we still believe that in-person sexual assault trainings should be mandatory for all students at the beginning of each academic year, we commend College administrators for the implementation of this online one. As the sexual assault report reminded us last spring, much work remains to be done.

Apparently someone decided that your head was next in line for House renovation, because it feels like a construction team jackhammered the inside of your delicate scalp overnight. You roll over on your side and grope at your phone. Jesus, you mutter to yourself, 2:20 p.m.? Rubbing your pounding forehead, you force yourself out of bed and into some clothes. Being the hungover idiot that you are, you’ve overslept and missed lunch at the d-hall. You’re left with one option: head out into Harvard Square.
The sun glares down accusingly at you as you hit the street, forcing you to lower your sunglasses over your eyes. It doesn’t help that the Harvard Turkey’s favorite grain joint is across the street from your dorm; the flashes of the paparazzi's cameras add to the harsh light assaulting your retinas. A bodyguard cracks open the limousine door, and the glamorous fowl himself hops in, ignoring the shouts of “Mr. Turkey!” and “Look this way!” He speeds away, and the crowd slowly disperses. The Harvard Turkey once stopped by a party you were at. It was one of the greatest moments of your life.
The inviting red sign of the Dewolfe St. CVS catches your eye. You do need more toothpaste, but then again, you can always go to the Bow St. location, or the Linden St. one; you could even stop by the grand opening of the Square’s 42nd CVS on Palmer St. You’ve asked, but no one seems to know why they keep opening up new locations. You stopped pushing the issue at number 30.
Looking up, you see you’ve arrived at... well, you’re not entirely sure what to call it. You stuck with Holyoke Center for a while, then switched to Smith Campus Center when that seemed en vogue, but before it was finished, a new family wrote a check and you started to lose track of who owned what or even what the point of the renovation was. The bidding frenzy intensified to the point whereat which the crew only had time to knock down one section before they were repurposed, until eventually the building was in ruins. In the end, Gerald Chan pulled the trigger on buying the entire Square and the constant din of machines finally stopped.
Skirting these ruins, you’re momentarily deafened by the powerful roar of a jumbo jet. When the last capital campaign went south, Drew Faust tried to save face by converting the Yard into an airport for tourists. Yes, they had to knock down all of the buildings in the Yard to construct it, but it provided a convenient excuse to move the campus to Allston, anyway. Plus, the airport had been built with bricks and covered in ivy, so tourists could take photos right in the terminal. Win-win.
“Hey!” A grizzled arm shoots out of the crowd to grab yours. Rotten, sharp fingernails dig into your skin. You try to pull away, but its grip is tight with desperation. “Please!”
The man grabbing you is part of a long line of bedraggled-looking people on the edge of the sidewalk. “I didn’t pack enough food man. If I give you money will you please buy me something?”
“Of course, no worries.” You smile at him. “How long you been waiting?”
His eyes widen. “Two months. But I’m so close, I can almost taste the margs!” Two months wasn’t too bad of a wait at Felipe’s Rooftop. One of your friends from home had visited and spent four-and-a-half months in line, but everyone knows that trying to get inside during Spring Break is foolish. After most of the other buildings had been converted into CVS locations, the Rooftop spun off into its own establishment, and the wait just kept getting longer and longer. Sometimes the queue extended across the Massachusetts state line into New York.
He presses a $20 into your palm. “God bless you. Super Burrito, no beans. Keep the change.” You nod, and hop down the street into Felipe’s proper and slide into the much shorter line. Since the divorce with the Rooftop, it's lost some of its glamor. But luckily the food is still good. Some things never change.

The Harvard Foundation named Nobel laureate and Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi its 2016 Humanitarian of the Year in a ceremony Saturday, while students from the Harvard Islamic Society stood outside to protest what they consider her silence toward the country’s persecuted Muslim minority.
Suu Kyi, elected head of Myanmar’s government in April, was placed under house arrest in 1989 for protesting against the country’s dictatorship and served 15 years in detention. During her early years,  Suu Kyi was held in solitary confinement and could not see her husband Michael V. Aris—at the time a visiting professor at Harvard—or her two sons. In 1991, Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her "non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights." 
In her speech to a packed Science Center lecture hall, Suu Kyi discussed overcoming fear and the need for national reconciliation in Myanmar.
“I believe that fear is at the root of all division. Because fear leads to hatred, and hatred leads to division,” she said.
The Harvard Foundation bestows its Humanitarian of the Year honor to “an individual whose works and deeds have served to improve the quality of our lives and have inspired us to greater heights,” according to its website. Past award recipients include Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai and United Nations Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon.
“She has dedicated her life to peace and reconciliation,” Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter said at the event.
Diana L. Eck, faculty dean of Lowell House and professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies, took to the lectern to reflect on the years Aris, a Tibetan scholar, was part of her department and lived with his sons in Quincy House.
Eck also acknowledged the protesters—a group of about 10 people standing silently outside the Science Center while the event occurred—saying “no one more than [Suu Kyi],” a lifelong protester herself, would appreciate and empathize with their protest “on behalf of the Rohingya,” which the United Nations considers among the most persecuted minorities in the world.
The protesters, some of whom were undergraduates, carried posters urging Suu Kyi to “earn” and “live up to” the award by “stand[ing] up for the Rohingya.” The Harvard Islamic  Society had last week criticized the Harvard Foundation for its selection of Suu Kyi as its Humanitarian of the Year.
Master’s student and Harvard Islamic Society member Mushfiqur Chowdhury, one of the protesters at the event, said, “What we want is for Aung San Suu Kyi to come away from this event thinking about the principles that she stood up for—the reasons that she got the Nobel Prize—and be able to speak for the populations and the marginalized groups that she claimed to represent before she was elected.”
“We’ve heard a lot of silence from her, and I think in the same way that she’s given us a lot of silence, we’re trying to silently protest this event,” he added.
In a statement issued before the event, Counter wrote that a protest would be “hurtful to our Burmese/Myanmar students and improper.”
Chowdhury called the decision to protest “complicated” because the students did not want to disrespect the Foundation, given that it supports the Islamic Society. Minutes before doors opened to the event, students decided against disrupting the speech.
Both Counter and Eck directly referenced the Rohingya in their speeches, but Suu Kyi did not. In May, she asked a U.S. ambassador to not use the term, and banned its use among her officials, supposedly to support the reconciliation process in Myanmar that she is overseeing.
“I’m very proud of the fact we are a nation of many peoples, and of many religions, and I’m sad that in latter years we have had communal problems in our country such as we have never had before,” Suu Kyi said, citing the nation’s 135 ethnic groups.
Hundreds of people attended the event, which was also simulcast in a lecture hall next door.

UPDATED: September 19, 2016, at 9:20 a.m.
With the goal of providing an evening free from the pressures of social labels, various women’s groups at the College are organizing the second [BLANK] party for undergraduates, aiming this year at a larger turnout and a later end time.
The idea for the first [BLANK] party came in the summer of 2015, from conversations among some undergraduate women about perceived shortcomings in campus nightlife. 
Some of those women felt that many parties divided the student body based on one’s group affiliation or class year and “a lot of the social power laid in the hands of fraternities, or male final clubs, or even some male student organizations,” said Avni Nahar ’17, a [BLANK] Party organizer and co-president of all-women’s organization the Seneca, a group without official recognition from the College.
Both Nahar, an inactive Crimson editor, and Amy L. Vest, the Office of Student Life’s director of student programming, declined to specify which women’s groups were organizing the event. The Seneca helped host last year’s [BLANK] Party, according to the group’s website.
The party, which will take place this Friday, is specifically timed during what Nahar characterized as a particularly divisive season within campus social life.
“Specifically during the fall semester on campus there are a lot of things happening simultaneously on the extracurricular front, like comps and punch that tend to divide people,” Nahar said, referring respectively to admissions processes for students groups and the recruitment process for final clubs. “It seemed like a really important time to offer a party that was a little different from the rest.”
Last year’s party, which drew more than 1,000, featured finger foods and a live band. The party last year was funded by money University President Drew G. Faust provided, and this year, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane, Faust has allocated another sum of money to the College to help the OSL pay for the party.
“[The Office of Student Life], like many students, sees a great value in having opportunities to come together like this on a large scale,” Vest said. “Events like [BLANK] Party affirm the College’s commitment to facilitating opportunities for students to engage with their peers in an environment where all are welcome.”
Organizers this year are hoping to draw an even larger crowd than last year’s with enhanced lighting effects, a later end time of 1:30 a.m., and increased publicity efforts so more people are made aware of the event.
The party comes at a time when the College is clamping down on unrecognized single-gender social organizations with historic penalties and simultaneously increasing its focus on student life programming.

CORRECTION: September 19, 2016
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Office of Student Life is the sole funder for the [BLANK] Party. In fact, the Office of the President is helping fund the event.

UPDATED: September 19, 2016, at 9:47 a.m.
Expanding from just a handful of students to become one of the most popular concentrations in the College, the Statistics Department is clearly trending.
The department has gone from 17 concentrators in 2008 to 199 as of December 2015, according to the College Handbook and the Statistics Department’s internal records.
Joseph K. Blitzstein, co-director of undergraduate studies in Statistics, said he believes that both internal changes to make the department more appealing and global trends have been factors in the positive trajectory.
“I think in the last 10 years, the Harvard Statistics Department has put more effort into making sure our courses are inviting, accessible, and interesting,” Blitzstein said.
In particular, he highlighted changes to introductory statistics classes meant to increase the department’s draw.
Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability,” which Blitzstein has taught nearly every year since 2006, has grown from 110 students in 2006 to 486 this fall—a number Blitzstein cited on Friday—making it the fifth most-popular course at the College this semester.
Blitzstein also suggested that the department’s other introductory courses could also be attracting more newcomers, particularly Statistics 102: “Introduction to Statistics for Life Sciences,” following Statistics professor David P. Harrington’s recent redesign of the course to appeal to life sciences concentrators and pre-med students.
Blitzstein also highlighted global trends he said may factor into the growing popularity of statistics.
“The rise of data science has been a big thing worldwide,” Blitzstein said, noting the public acclaim received by statistics-driven media such as the best-selling book-turned-film “Moneyball,” as well as analyses conducted by data journalists such as Nate Silver, the founder of the FiveThirtyEight blog known for its election predictions.
It has been difficult for the Statistics Department to keep up with the rapid growth in concentrators, and the department currently has a shortage of professors, Blitzstein said.
“We’ve had to think about how to handle advising, and mentoring, and teaching, and doing the best we can with still having a small faculty size,” Blitzstein said.
Any potential growing pains do not appear to have hindered some current and former concentrators, who highlighted their positive experiences with the discipline.
Matthew T. DiSorbo ’17 switched his concentration from Economics to Statistics after taking Stat 110 his sophomore fall and becoming fascinated by how useful he found the discipline.
“It was very interesting, very applied, and also gelled with a lot of potential career paths,” DiSorbo said.
After he graduates, DiSorbo said he plans to go into finance but added that the possibilities for Statistics concentrators are many.
“I think Stat concentrators now have the world at their fingertips,” he said.
Michele S. Zemplenyi ’13, a former Statistics concentrator, said she values the flexibility of her past concentration as she moves beyond her time as an undergraduate. Following graduation, Zemplenyi took a job related to data analytics in business, and is now in her second year of a biostatistics Ph.D. program at the School of Public Health.
“What’s nice about statistics is that you don’t actually have to pick a statistics subject area right away because many of the tools that you learn as a Statistics concentrator can be applied to a number of areas,” Zemplenyi said.
Statistics already represents the eighth largest concentration in the College and the second largest in the FAS Science division, according to data provided by Statistics senior lecturer Michael I. Parzen. But Blitzstein said the department has even loftier aspirations for the future.
“I would like to see the department as a hub for data science and data analysis at Harvard,” Blitzstein said. “To have opportunities that could come from all over the Boston area or beyond for analyzing interesting data sets, [with us as] the experts for providing tools and knowledge needed for complicated modern data sets.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Bishop C. Holifield was a student at Harvard Law School in 1967 at the apex of the civil rights movement, the fledgling organization he had founded—the Harvard Black Law Students Association—had just two members: himself and co-founder Reginald E. Gilliam.
Nearly 50 years and six deans later, BLSA has a membership of around 150 students, the Law School has seen a marked increase in the numbers of black students and faculty, and several waves of race-related activism have swept its campus.
This weekend, generational divides were bridged as over 800 black alumni, spanning class years and professions, descended on the Law School’s campus for the fourth Celebration of Black Alumni to exchange stories, advise current students, and confer on race-related problems at the Law School and in the wider world.
While the weekend was largely festive, alumni also engaged with contemporary issues at the school such as the demands of current student activists and the enrollment numbers of black students at the Law School. In her welcome letter, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow urged alumni to visit a library exhibit on the school’s recently-retired shield and to commemorate “that legacy of Harvard Law School’s debt to the enslaved persons of the Royall household.”
The Celebration of Black Alumni was started by alumnus and Law professor David B. Wilkins in 2000 to showcase the accomplishments of black Law School graduates and entice them back to campus. He said he had observed that many black alumni previously avoided general class reunions, because of their troubled relationship with the Law School.
“For many of the black alumni, it was a difficult experience for a variety of reasons and one of them was they didn’t feel welcomed or included in the school in many ways,” Wilkins said. “[CBA] was a kind of transformative experience for people, and it gave them an opportunity to work through some of the pain that they had associated with the school, and to reconcile with themselves that the school had actually done wonderful things for them over the years.”
This year’s CBA program—which centered around the theme “Turning Vision into Action”—included speeches by alumni U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson, and criminal law attorney and Harvard Corporation member Theodore V. Wells.
Alumni attended a question and answer session with Minow and discussed topics including criminal justice, diversity in the legal profession, and “the blessing and the burden” of a Harvard Law degree. Organizers also presented Wells, Wilkins, and Law professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr. with awards honoring their contributions to racial justice.
“I think what [CBA] does is it creates an avenue for a very significant portion of the legal professional community to get together to exchange notes, to exchange ideas, to help each other,” Holifield, who was one of the oldest attendees, said. “There’s a certain amount of renewal that comes from a gathering of that nature—you actually draw strength.”
For the first time, a sizable group of current students interacted with alumni over the course of the weekend. BLSA hosted a mentorship session to allow students to network with attendees and inform alumni about recent events on campus.
Over the past year, student activists with the group Reclaim Harvard Law issued a series of demands to administrators and occupied the school’s student lounge to protest what they identify as problems with the treatment of minorities at the school.
“I was proud to see so many current students there,” Wilkins said. “I also think that has something to do with the fact that there’s been a lot of activity and unrest on campus over the past year, and I think that the students were very hungry to engage with alumni, and alumni were hungry to engage with students to give students some perspective on the historical context.”
Reclaim Harvard Law members Ke’Andra Levingston and Cameron Clark—who say the movement is ongoing—gave a presentation about their activism last year to explain their demands and solicit support. Levingston and Clark sought to connect the challenges of past generations to those black students at the school face today.
“We really wanted to root it in the history of black activism at the law school,” Clark said. “We wanted to show that a lot of the things that black alumni dealt with at the Law School are still things that black students experience.”
Clark said alumni have expressed interest in supporting Reclaim Harvard Law in the form of mentorship, financial resources, and letters to the administration. Levingston and Clark also called on alumni to support other current movements across the University, including the potential HUDS strike.
But some older alumni like Wells cautioned student activists against letting protests interfere with their studies. “I have advised [activists] that they are part of this legacy of great black lawyers educated at Harvard who have devoted their lives to battling for legal justice, and they should be proud that they are part of such a legacy,” Wells said. “They should recognize that the struggle for equal justice continues and will continue throughout their lifetime… and it is important that they prepare themselves for that struggle by studying as hard as they can at Harvard Law School.”
In his keynote address, Wilkins identified low enrollment numbers of black students at the Law School and across the nation as a pressing issue, sparking conversation among alumni about how to combat the problem. Wilkins called on alumni to pay it forward by personally reaching out to prospective students and encouraging them to enroll.
“When you leave Harvard Law School, you don’t really realize the influence you have,” said
Anisha Queen, who graduated in 2014, as she recalled her preconceptions of law school as a young black student. “It was this imaginary land. I could dream about it maybe, but actually attending? Never. So just instilling in black teens that it’s not just something that non-black people do—you are capable, you do belong, and you can succeed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zero—that is the total shots on goal that the Harvard women’s soccer team allowed on Sunday against the Villanova Wildcats.
Under a breezy overcast day at Ohiri Field, the Crimson defeated Villanova, 3-0, on two goals and an assist from senior forward Midge Purce, to put a bow on its 2016 non-conference play. Harvard (5-3) wrapped up its non-conference schedule on a three-game winning streak ahead of its Ivy League opener at Penn.
Villanova (2-7) continues its slide, having now lost seven of its last eight.
“Since we started against UConn, we’ve improved in incremental ways, trying to play a complete game, and I think we did that today,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “We knew we had some tough games early in the schedule, but we’ve learned an awful lot from them.”
Purce, playing on her birthday, led the way for the Crimson offense, striking first on a header in the 42nd minute to give Harvard a 1-0 lead after a long scoreless half. Co-captain Bailey Gary played a highlight-reel cross into the left side that senior forward Karly Zlatic was able to head over to Purce.
“Bailey played a great ball from deep, and Karly did the work to put it across the face of the goal, which is hard to do,” Purce said. “I just happened to get there at the right time.”
The star senior continued to provide chances right out of the gate in the second half, firing a cross into the left side that sophomore Leah Mohammadi powered into the net off of a defender.
“Leah scored her second goal of the year today from a midfield position, and that’s what we’ve been encouraging them to do,” Hamblin said. “We look at both sides of the ball—we want them to be defending hard but also get involved with the attack…I’m really happy with the way our team shape is connecting, and how we’re having midfield players make offensive contributions.”
With Villanova’s offense stifled, the field was essentially shortened for the Crimson to play with. Senior forward Rachel Garcia drew a free kick just outside the penalty box in the 65th minute, and Purce capped her day by converting the kick off the top of the crossbar, cementing the game at 3-0.
Still, complementing Purce’s offensive rampage was a defensive shutdown that allowed just seven shots and none on goal.
“We’ve been focusing on our defending since preseason, and today was a very good team defensive performance,” Hamblin said. “If we do a good job with our forwards and our midfielders, it’s going to limit the opportunities that [Villanova] will have. When they did get into the final third, our defenders did a really good job keeping them at bay.”
Freshman goalie Kat Hess had an uneventful time during her first career start between the pipes. Neither her, nor senior goalie Lizzie Durack, who came on for the second half, were tasked with making a save.
Gary kept it simple when explaining Harvard’s defensive success.
“It’s always one of our goals to limit chances, limit opportunities, so we try to focus on that as much as we can,” Gary said. “If they have fewer chances, they’ll have fewer goals.”
Freshman forward Ida DiClemente led Villanova’s offense with three of her team’s seven shots. In net for the Wildcats, junior goalie Emily Harris tallied three saves and three goals allowed in her full 90 minutes of work.
Given how well the home team worked on both sides of the ball, the Crimson’s search for a “complete game” seems to have been fulfilled for the time being.
“We’re in a good place,” said Hamblin. “We’re looking forward to Penn, who’s had some good results, and it’ll, of course, be a good challenge on the road.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last September, the Harvard women won the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet by a one-point margin for the first time in over 10 years.
This year, the team would not be able to climb back to the top spot.
Despite junior Courtney Smith’s victory in the women’s 5K, Yale’s heavy presence on the leaderboard—taking complete ownership of 2nd through 7th places—prevented the Harvard women’s cross country meet from taking home the overall win for the second year in a row.
After racing last fall in the NCAA Championships—as well as being an indoor track All-American and running in the USATF Olympic Trials in the 10,000-meter race—Smith ran a solid race, taking home the title of individual champion in this historic race.
“It’s a really special race since its one of the oldest tri-meets in the country,” Smith said. “I think we went out there today to do what we love and had some great races.”
Junior Elianna Shwayder also had a top-10 performance, coming in eighth place with a time of 19:24.9.
On the men’s side, Yale senior James Randon was the only runner to break 25 minutes in the 8K, finishing in first with a time of 24:58.9. Randon was followed by a string of Princeton runners.
“Today we sat out a few guys and held a couple more back from going all out because of sickness and injuries,” captain Brandon Price said. “Despite that, we still were able to compete well with two of the best teams in the league.”
Price led Harvard in seventh place with a time of 25:14.7, followed by freshman Murimi Nyamu in eighth.
On both the men’s and women’s teams, the freshman had strong debut races and played big roles in keeping Harvard competitive with Princeton and Yale.
“We’re a young team. We have six new people this year, but they’re fitting in really well and I already feel like we’re best friends with all of them. The new freshmen really stepped it up,” said Smith.
On the men’s side, Murimi Nyamu and Will Battershill were eighth and 13th overall, but were second and fourth amongst the  freshmen. For the women, Freshmen Eliza Rego and Gillian Meeks were the third and fourth finishers for Harvard, coming in 14th and 15th places respectively. Only one other freshman, Princeton’s Ally Rome, beat Rego and Meeks.
Overall, Princeton led the men’s event by a significant margin, finishing with 23 points ahead of Yale’s 49 points and Harvard’s 55 points. In the women’s 5k, Yale dominated with 23 points, Harvard was second with 53 points and Princeton had 63 points.
“We're looking forward to our next race in two weeks at the Paul Short Invitational.  We'll have everyone racing at one hundred percent capacity then,” Price said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This final weekend of action before the beginning of conference play was an opportunity for Harvard to tune-up one last time as the squad prepares to host Yale next Friday. But both games against Northeastern (4-2) and UMass (4-3) ended in disappointment for the Crimson (2-4).
Harvard was within striking distance in both games, but failed to close out the matches in the end. Against Northeastern, the Crimson’s furious rally was not enough to overcome its first-half deficit. In contrast, Harvard fell flat against the Minutewomen after an early second half equalizer by senior forward Marissa Balleza.
UMASS 3, HARVARD 1
The Crimson came out fighting against Massachusetts in Amherst, ready to get back on a winning streak. The game was deadlocked until the 30th minute when UMass junior defender Melanie Kreusch scored off of a penalty stroke.
After the second half commenced, senior forward Marissa Balleza continued her torrid scoring by stealing the ball in the UMass defensive zone and maneuvering around the goalkeeper to score her fourth goal of the season. She is now only five goals away from the all-time career mark, set by Judy Collins ’99 at 43, with eleven games to go until the season ends.
“From the beginning of the season, I knew that Marissa was going to be a leader in our front field,” said coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “Her skill set, her determination to go to goal, and the ability to finish on goal sets a great example for our younger players.”
The Minutewomen responded ten minutes later with two quick goals by junior midfielder Sarah Hawkshaw and Melanie Kreusch, her second of the game. The Crimson could not come back from that deficit, and ended up winless on the weekend.
“Marissa had a great goal and if we finished a bit more we could have come back,” said co-captain Sarah Finnemore. “Overall, I think played pretty strongly. We just have a few things that we need to work on to get the outcome that we want.”
NORTHEASTERN 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard and Northeastern battled until the end of regulation on a blustery Friday evening at Berylson Family Field Hockey Field, but the Huskies hung on despite a furious late rally by the Crimson.
“I don’t think we eventually got what we deserved to get,” said van Herwaarden. “It’s sometimes part of the sport. I think we actually did very well. The team worked really hard.”
Northeastern struck early twice to give them a commanding advantage over Harvard.
Harvard climbed back into the contest briefly with a 24th minute goal by senior midfielder Abbey Thornhill. But Northeastern owned the first half. They closed with a 29th minute goal by junior forward Jamie Bartucca, who displayed great skill maneuvering around several Harvard defenders, leading to a second-chance goal off a rebound.
Senior forward Marissa Balleza ignited a second half Harvard rally with a diving lunge to net the ball in the 41st  minute. The Crimson put on an immense amount of pressure down the stretch, controlling possession and outshooting the Huskies 11-3 in the second half.
“We need to get more return on the investment,” said van Herwaarden. “I mean, we do a lot of hard work, we had a couple of really good opportunities, and we have to be a little bit sharper. Also, we have to play tougher on the rebounds.”
A second goal seemed to seal Northeastern’s victory, but a late goal by Harvard in the 68th minute set up a frenzied couple final minutes. Two final opportunities off penalty corners gave Harvard the chance to complete the comeback, but a shot flew just over the backboard to end the game.
“Just the effort that was put in, especially by a lot of the younger players, shows you how much potential this team has and how much we can do,” said captain Kyla Cordrey. “Maybe it was a wakeup call to lose this game, but I think we have to put it behind us and move forward….We still haven’t hit Ivy’s yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Beren Tennis Center witnessed 78 matches as the Harvard men’s tennis team took on Illinois, Notre Dame, and Texas A&M in the grueling Chowder Fest tournament. In this intense three-day season opener for the Crimson, the players tackled a high volume of matches, rapidly transitioning from summer training into the competitive season.
Harvard saw ups and downs throughout the weekend. The team struggled initially in doubles but also had some standout individual performances. Senior Brian Yeung led the team and ended the weekend with 7 matches under his belt, nabbing 2-1 in singles and 3-1 in doubles with his partner, sophomore Michael Peters. Sophomore Andy Zhou, who was a consistent force on the team last year, overcame a wrist injury and earned a 2-1 record in singles.
SUNDAY
The Crimson went 4-5 in singles play on Sunday, with Yeung, Zhou, Peters, and freshman Logan Weber taking home victories.
Zhou faced a particularly demanding matchup against Notre Dame junior Drew Dawson. After falling behind 4-1 in the first set, Zhou kept his calm and came back to take the set in a close tiebreaker.
On the brink of a comfortable 5-2 lead in the second set, however, Zhou gave up three consecutive games and found himself down 5-4.
“I got a little cocky for a second,” the California native said. “In that situation it’s easy to get down completely and think about the points that you lost and the chances that you missed, but I kept it together when I needed to and just tried to deal with the situation.”
Zhou managed to recover and again the set went into a tiebreaker. Zhou’s strong mental game gave him enough of an edge to win the tiebreaker and earn a 7-5, 7-5 victory for Harvard.
“You feel very hyperactive and you feel like the situation is spinning out of control, but I managed to play one of my best points to win. It was such a boost of confidence,” Zhou said.
The Crimson earned victories in three of its five doubles matches on Sunday. Yeung and Peters handily defeated the Notre Dame opponents 6-2, and captains Sebastian Beltrame and Jean Thirouin overcame their Texas A&M opponents. While Zhou and Weber fell 6-0, sophomore Samuel Beren and junior Grant Solomon earned a 6-3 win.
Having focused less on doubles in practice, the team’s improvement in doubles was noticeable across the weekend.
“We were a little rusty at first, but we progressed a lot towards the end,” Yeung said. “The other teams definitely practiced more in doubles than we did before this tournament, but I think we did pretty well given how much we’ve done.”
SATURDAY
The Crimson struggled in singles on Saturday, earning only three wins in its 13 matches throughout the day. Zhou and Weber bested their Texas A&M opponents while Beren edged out his Notre Dame opponent in a tight three-set match.
The Saturday matches were a valuable learning opportunity for the new freshmen on the team, as freshmen Galen Lee and Weber both took the courts twice that day.
“The freshmen got a good idea of how college tennis is compared to juniors tennis,” Yeung said. “College tennis is definitely mentally tougher, so they got good experience in.”
Harvard split its doubles matches with a 4-4 record. Yeung and Peters suffered a close 7-5 loss to Notre Dame before coming back to beat their Illinois opponents 6-3. The duo of Beltrame and Thirouin were similarly edged out by their Notre Dame opponents in a close tiebreaker, but came back with a handy 6-2 win against Illinois.
The teams of Beren with Zhou and junior Kenny Tao with Weber earned both earned 6-3 wins against Notre Dame.
FRIDAY
The Crimson began the tournament with a rocky start in doubles, going 1-3. The duo of Yeung and Peters took home the only win for Harvard in a close 7-5 victory over their Illinois opponents.
On the singles side, the Crimson logged 5-5. The matches were closer than the score suggests, with multiple three-set face-offs. Beltrame suffered a close three-set loss while Yeung came back from a loss in his second set to shut out his opponent 6-0 in the third set.
Thirouin struggled to come back after winning the first set and giving up the second set, ultimately losing to his Texas A&M opponent 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. Tao came back from a 2-6 loss in the first set to sweep the next two sets and claim a win for Harvard. Lee and Weber both earned victories, while Beren and junior Xavier Gonzalez fell to their Notre Dame opponents.
Despite multiple injured players on the team, the Chowder Fest marked a decent start to Harvard’s fall season.
“It was a good opportunity for the entire team to get used to what it’s like coming back from summer break,” Zhou said. “I feel like up and down the board we played really well. I think that once we have all our guys up and running we’ll be able to do some good damage this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the second weekend of competition for the Harvard sailing team, the group, participating in four events, continually placed in the middle of the pack. Ivy League rival No. 1 Yale, however, placed first in three of the four regattas. With winds hovering at about 8-12 knots, the weather made for a good racing weekend.
STU NELSON TROPHY
At the helm of FJs, Harvard won its best ranking of the weekend in the bi-divisional interconference regatta hosted by Connecticut College. The Crimson, placed eighth of 18 teams with a total score of 213.
Of the Ivy League teams present, Harvard placed behind Brown and Yale, which received first and third place, but edged out Dartmouth by seven points.
In Harvard’s A-Division, juniors skipper Taylor Ladd and crew Kirstin Anderson, posted a low score of 103 and secured a seventh place individual finish. In the B-Division, represented by freshman skipper Lucy Wilmot and co-captain crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj, the group finished with 110 points and ninth overall.
“Our main goal and focus by the end of the season is to qualify for the [Atlantic Coast Championships] and to just keep growing as a women’s team,” Ladd said. “Our women’s program is on the upswing after a few years of not doing as well as we would hope. We have a lot more women’s skippers this year and we’re really hoping to continue the momentum that we had from last year.”
CENTRAL SERIES TROPHY
Following last year’s first place finish at this race, the Crimson came into this meet hosted by Boston College to try to defend its title in the first Central Series of the season. Ultimately, Harvard finished ninth of the 17 schools at event.
Sailing for the Crimson in the A-Division were sophomore skipper Taylor Gavula and senior crew Emma Wheeler, who posted a score of 103.
The B-Division was represented by freshman skipper Jessica Williams and sophomore crew Divya Arya, who earned a score of 82. This younger group was fresh off of a third place overall and first place B-Division finish at last week’s Lark Invitational, which had helped the Crimson win gold there.
Harvard fished the meet with a total score of 185 points, 88 behind the first place finisher, Yale. Brown placed second with 130.
NEVINS TROPHY
With winds from 8-13 knots and ten races in each of the three divisions, the Saturday races hosted by Kings Point ended with Harvard in 12th place. Totaling 525 points in the tight race, the Crimson fell to Yale, which collected gold with 320 points, but beat out division rivals Dartmouth and Penn.
“The competition was very steep and the racing was extremely tight, making it so that even the smallest mistakes on the racecourse were felt in our scores,” sophomore skipper Jackson Wagner said. “The racing this weekend confirmed that we are a fast team, our boat speed was very strong, keeping us towards the top of the fleet in our cleaner races. Moving forward we need to work on fleet navigation, especially in condensed sections of the racecourse, to minimize fouling and positioning mistakes and keep our scores more consistently positive throughout the series.
The C-Division of the Harvard team, staffed by sophomore skipper Andrew Puopolo, posted the lowest squad score of 121, sixth place in his division. The A-Division of junior co-captain Nick Sertl and sophomore crew Christine Gosioco earned 225 points and the B-Division, Wagner and sophomore crew Catherine Tang, collected 179 of their own.
HATCH BROWN TROPHY
Racing in the tri-divisional inter-conference Hatch Brown Trophy hosted by MIT, Harvard finished tenth out of a total of 19 teams. Sailing in NC Fireflies, the team tallied a total score 515 points and was beat out by two other Ivy League rivals, the Bulldogs and Dartmouth, which placed first and second, respectively.
Of Harvard’s three divisions, the C-Division, staffed by sophomore skipper Nicholas Karnovsky and sophomore crew Alejandra Resendiz, posted the best score of the group with a 138. In the A, sophomore skipper Nicholas DiGiovanni and senior crew Julia Lord, and B, junior skipper Dylan Farrell and senior crew Priscilla Russo, Divisions earned 186 and 191, respectively.
“I think we all felt really good about the regatta as a whole,” Ladd said. “We learned a lot throughout the weekend and definitely got better at the things we were aiming to work on and came out feeling good about our result and even better about our results in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning six members from last year’s No. 55 ranked squad, the Harvard women’s tennis team began the 2016-2017 campaign with decent performances across the board against the likes of the University of California Berkeley, Oklahoma State, and Georgia Tech.
The Crimson’s competitors, ranked No. 2, No. 8, and No. 16 in the nation, respectively, provided quite a test. Although the team was able to contest closely in many of the matches, they were only able to muster four wins on the entire weekend.
Besides the fact that the Harvard played against such quality competition, there was something else special about the team’s opening weekend: the event’s venue.  Hosted in Newport, R.I. at the International Tennis Hall of Fame, the Hall of Fame ITA Grass Court Invitational was the first collegiate tournament held on a grass playing surface. Needless to say, it provided much excitement and anticipation for all of the event’s competitors.
“It was an honor to play in the first collegiate grass court tennis tournament… [competing] against such highly-ranked teams at the International Tennis Hall of Fame, where so many of my own idols played,” sophomore Sabrina Xiong said.
Playing in the same arena that many of the tennis greats have also played in before them, the team particularly felt the magnitude of the situation before them.
“Competing at the International Tennis Hall of Fame is an experience I will never forget since all of my idols, such as Federer and Laver have hit their forehands and serves on the same exact courts,” junior Annika Ringblom said.
But the Crimson didn’t let the excitement get to its head, as the team put forth a solid effort against the robust competition that it faced in the multi-flight singles and doubles round robin events.
In the Billie Jean King flight, captain June Lee lost a hard fought battle, 1-6,6-3,8-10, against the eventual undefeated round robin champion, Vladica Babic of Oklahoma State. Lee played quite competitively with her rivals throughout the weekend, having also lost in a third-set tiebreaker the day prior to her match against Babic.
The Cowboys continued their roll in the Chris Evert flight, as Sophia Blanco bested Harvard freshman Nika Besker, 6-3, 6-3, en-route to her own undefeated singles weekend.  Karla Popovic of Cal broke the Cowboys streak in the Stephanie Graf flight, however, after besting her three competitors, Ringblom, Georgia Tech’s Luc Fabian, and Oklahoma State’s Katie Stresnakova.
In doubles, the Crimson also played its competitors tightly.  The pairing Ringblom and Xiong lost, 8-6, in both of their hotly contested doubles matches, while freshman Irene Lu and sophomore Erica Oosterhout claimed victory in their two contests.
“This weekend we all showed that we are a team to be reckoned with, even the freshman where this was their first college competition,” Ringblom said.
In fact, Harvard’s only two singles wins came from a freshman. In her first few match for the Crimson, Houston, Tx. native, Natasha Gonzalez, claimed victory against her competitor from Cal. After losing a hard fought battle in her next contest, she recovered to bring home another win in decisive fashion.
Gonzalez is one of seven new freshmen on the squad, along with Besker, Lu, Jenna Friedel, Lexi Milunovich, Kaelli Thiel, and Angelina Ye.  Receiving a challenging introduction to the world of collegiate tennis, the group of rookies responded solidly.
“Even though we had a lot of tough matches, each one showed that we're just as good as the other teams,” Xiong said. “We all fought really hard and showed a lot of heart and fortitude on the court.”
Having completed its only competition on the International Tennis Hall of Fame’s rather unique playing surface for the 2016-2017 campaign, Harvard looks to build off of its results as it moves forward in the young fall season.
“Since this was our first and last grass competition of the year, we will going back to hard court to focus on our conditioning and match play,” Ringblom said. “We will be giving it 100% on the court everyday to show that we are not only a force to be reckoned with in the Ivy League, but in the nation as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby team gave the University of New England a rude awakening in the school’s first ever intercollegiate rugby game on Saturday afternoon.
The Crimson (2-0), dismantled the Nor’easters (1-1) 54-0, pushing the team to its second win of the season and continuing its dominance over opponents in the early stages of this season.
“I was really happy with how we played yesterday,” sophomore Caitlin Weigel said. “We didn’t start off the best, we were actually pretty sloppy in the opening half but our second we fixed what we needed to fix and we came out and destroyed the competition.”
Leading the destruction of the University of New England was senior Claire Collins, who had four tries over the course of the game and lead Harvard in all offensive categories on the day. Her four scores came in as a career high for the four-year member of the team, who is currently the only senior on the Crimson’s active roster as well as the only remaining member of the era of Harvard rugby that did not recruit players to come to Cambridge.
“It’s weird for me because I was a walk-on and these girls know what they’re doing,” Collins said. “It’s really nice to have the rugby knowledge and they have really good vision and are able to understand the space and see the game flow.”
Though Collins was dominant on the pitch, the Crimson had other key contributions on both sides of the ball. Sophomore Akweley Okine ignited the scoring for Harvard, converting the first try in the opening minutes of the game. After that puncture, the floodgates opened for the Crimson.
Collins followed Okine’s scoring drive with three of her own, giving Harvard a 22-0 advantage over the Nor’easters before the half.
Of her four tries, Collins scored one off of a set piece on a scrum, while the other three came in opening field play where the team had done work to bunch the defense away from Collins, enabling her to communicate her passing needs to her teammates and ultimately barreling through the opponent’s defense.
“Claire has been a great leader this year,” Weigel said. “She leads by example in everything we do. She’s always there when any of us have had questions and she’s really stepped into that leader role, especially in her senior year.”
Weigel recorded her own try for the Crimson to cap off the scoring on the day. Classmate Jenny Kronish and freshmen Delia Hellander and Emily Prentice each scored for Harvard in the second half, rounding out the onslaught of points the team brought against UNE’s defense.
On the other side of the coin, the Crimson’s defense held its opponent to seven points or less for the second game in a row. After handily beating Navy, 32-7, last week, Harvard did itself one better this week when it held the Nor’easters to zero points over the course of the game.
“Having these games is giving us a lot of confidence and getting us really excited to play some tough competition later in the season,” Weigel said. “We’ve been working really hard on our defense so to know that the scoreboard reflects the work we put in at practice is really awesome.”
For veterans on the team like Collins, this season is an opportunity to see the rugby team’s full potential and test the work it has put in during the off season and during pre-season practice.
“This team is really exciting and there are a lot of young players but they’re really understanding of how the game works and how we align and how we work together and we’re really working well together which is really cool.” Collins said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team took to the Malkin Athletic Center for one final tune-up before it starts its Ivy League schedule this past weekend. The Crimson split the weekend series, opening up with a win against Boston College, 3-2, and falling to Northeastern on Saturday, 3-1.
“We struggled a little bit,” sophomore Christina Cornelius said. “Our problem was that we didn’t start off as strong as we wanted to, but I think we can only go up from here. Now we’re going to get back into practice, and work as hard as we did heading into [Friday].”
NORTHEASTERN 3, HARVARD 1
Harvard (2-7) took a slight step back Saturday, losing to Northeastern (8-4) for the first time since 2013.
The Crimson was plagued with slow starts to its sets all night. Trailing the first set 16-9, Harvard managed to rally back to a 25-23 win. But the team wasn’t able to continue to dig itself out of its own holes, dropping the next three sets after falling behind quickly in each of them.
Hannah Fry led the Huskies’ attack on the night, finishing with 13 kills, one more than fellow teammate Brigitte Burcescu.
Freshmen saw increased playing time in the team’s final match before its bid for a third-straight Ivy League title begins on Friday against Dartmouth. With the departure of a large senior class, the underclassmen are a vital part of the Crimson’s chances of winning the Ancient Eight.
“The freshmen are doing a great job.” Cornelius said. “We have a super strong freshman class, and they play a really big role on the team, so by having them play in the preseason, we’re getting them ready for the Ivy League.”
The Crimson will look for the freshmen to make an impact not just on the attacking side, but step up as part of the defensive effort as well. Rookie Erin McCarthy did so in the contest against the Huskies, leading the team with 13 digs. 
HARVARD 3, BOSTON COLLEGE 2
Following a rocky stretch at the Beantown Challenge and the Baden Invitational hosted by Long Beach State, it looked that the Crimson was going to continue its slide after it found itself down two sets to one to the Eagles.
But behind a kill and ace from senior Corie Bain, along with two kills from rookie Grace Roberts Burbank, Harvard jumped out to a quick 11-5 lead in the fourth set. After the Eagles (5-5) tied the set at 13 points apiece, the Crimson would go on a 9-2 run and did not look back for the rest of the frame to force a tiebreaking set.
In the final set, it was the Eagles that snatched an early 5-3 lead behind a kill from Sol Calvete, who finished the match with a game-high 17 kills. But Harvard would take the lead back after a 4-0 run behind kills from Cornelius and freshman Maclaine Fields, along with an ace from rookie Isabelle Tashima. The set would go back and forth, eventually settling at 15 points apiece. From there, another kill from Fields and an attacking error by Calvete handed Harvard the deciding set.
“We did really well,” Cornelius said. “We played as a team—had a lot of fire coming out. We had a rough game against UNH, so we really made it a priority to get into practice, work super hard, go for every ball, and to hit as hard as we can. We executed that really well yesterday.”
The freshmen led much of the offensive attack. Roberts-Burbank and Fields led the team with 16 kills apiece, while McCarthy earned 20 digs on the defensive side.
“This team is getting more powerful by the day,” McCarthy said. “We’re working super hard in practice, and every team we play we get better. We need to improve on being a cohesive unit on the court. Sometimes when we start to make mistakes we get a little bit frazzled.”

Everyone loves a good puppy study break. Life at Harvard is stressful, and nothing says relaxation like a small four-legged animal with a wet nose and an unpredictable bladder. No one knows this better than University President Drew G. Faust.
In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, that other Harvard publication that works its way into your email inbox every morning, Faust revealed that she had recently adopted a panicked, dependent mammal that may vomit all over the carpet. (No, we’re not talking about the freshmen who share Massachusetts Hall with Faust every year).
In case you didn’t get it, Faust got a puppy.
The president of the wealthiest university in the world adopted Alice, as she dubbed the dog, from a shelter at four months old. Faust admits that she is “not sure of her origins.”
“I want to get a dog DNA test and try to figure out what she is,” Faust told the Gazette.
But this isn’t wonderland, folks. This is Harvard, Faust is a president, and that can only mean one thing: this dog means business.
“She is some kind of hunter. She points. I think she might be some kind of herder because she also herds. You know how they get down and look, she does that,” Faust said.
